1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,770
Three,
two.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,550
Hello Carl.
Hello,

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,410
Joe Rogan.
Good to see you again buddy.

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,160
Good to see you too.
Is like Deja Vu.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,730
It was,
I think it was eight months ago or so.

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,340
Then I was on the podcast wasn't and it 
flew like that.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,990
Yeah,
it does fly like that.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,430
Yeah.
That's kind of scary.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,780
A little too quick.
Yeah.

10
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:24,870
I just turned 30 and 40 before you know 
it.

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,063
Well,
I was going to say 30 was the first one 

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,500
where I ever really stopped like 30 
minutes before I turned 30.

13
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,240
I actually took a moment and I was like,
okay,

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,253
you're 29.
Enjoy your last 30 minutes of being 29 

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,230
and when I hit 30 it was the first 
little inkling of.

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,150
I guess this is kind of what a midlife 
crisis feels like because I have a three

17
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:45,984
in front now and I'm not really not 
comfortable with that because I feel 

18
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:50,570
like I'm still a fucking 19 year old,
you know?

19
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,320
Well it's a weird thing to be obsessed 
with your,

20
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,810
your.
It's an inevitable progression.

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,450
Like to be obsessed with youth.
Yeah.

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,610
I love being in my twenties.
Well,

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,250
why would you love something that's 
going to go away real quick?

24
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,250
Yeah,
it's going to get old.

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,200
It's nothing you can do about it.
Just stay healthy.

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,480
Yeah,
and people who fight it,

27
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,890
it's always easy to tell that when they 
go get plastic surgery and stuff.

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,620
If you.
If you do like one plastic surgery,

29
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,240
sometimes somebody could get away with 
it,

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,300
but if you do multiple,
all everybody knows almost immediately.

31
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,820
You ever watched that show?
Botched.

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,790
I didn't know.
I just started getting into it.

33
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:30,624
I accidentally watched it.
I turned the TV on and it was just on 

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,700
like when I turned the TV on and I was 
like,

35
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,534
what in the fuck?
And this lady was getting her nose 

36
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:38,934
repaired because it had collapsed 
because she had gotten so many plastic 

37
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:42,714
surgeries on her nose that are sinus had
caved in so they had to take a chunk of 

38
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:49,290
her rib proper knows,
but then then the,

39
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,940
the tissue inside was dying.

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,240
One of those guys wants to come on.
They found out we were talking about it.

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,140
So he wants to,
I don't know how many times can you talk

42
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,610
about plastic surgery,
Dr.

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,210
patient.
Not Patient fucked up,

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,253
but what's the doctor going to try to do
pitch your audience on getting to know 

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,620
the opposite?
I think he's probably against the repair

46
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:11,930
guy.
Oh,

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,440
so what shows about repairing people 
that fucked up and you know,

48
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:19,170
it looks so primitive to when you see 
how they do it,

49
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,190
like the way that they do.
I noticed this about wisdom teeth when I

50
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,220
got my wisdom teeth pulled out,
they literally just go in there like you

51
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,470
would expect for like a car repair and 
they're just like,

52
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,700
all right,
time to rip it out.

53
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:32,010
And you see them like leaning on him 
pulling it and you're like,

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,660
oh I thought this was more advanced than
this,

55
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,494
but it's really not step on your cheek.
And I actually went under for my wisdom 

56
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,240
teeth because I've heard.
I know I'm such a bitch,

57
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,210
but I,
I thought so.

58
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,320
I guess I got the Michael Jackson stuff,
the propofol.

59
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:47,280
I think it was,
I was,

60
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,380
it was a nice.
It's weird because you just,

61
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,830
they tell you to like count back down 
from 100 and 199 and I remember stop.

62
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,420
Oh my God,
that's so terrible.

63
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:08,280
That's knee surgery.
What is going on here?

64
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,173
What stock?
Whatever the fuck they put in as Neiman 

65
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,990
and he's trying to get it out.
Oh my Jesus.

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,033
Oh cool.

67
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,443
So yeah,
the moral of the story is we actually 

68
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:20,514
don't know what we're doing as human 
beings and we're still obviously very 

69
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,484
primitive.
Even the advanced stuff is super 

70
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:27,000
primitive.
That's what that shows.

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,100
Well,
I don't know,

72
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,370
maybe that guy just fucked up.
I don't,

73
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't think I've ever seen that 
before.

74
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,890
But isn't it for everything?
Like even with those jobs,

75
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:35,820
don't they do the same thing?
Like Oh,

76
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:39,450
we're going to chisel down the nose so 
they have to take like a fricking sander

77
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:42,200
or something and just do it.
Yeah.

78
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,960
I had my deviated septum fixed and then 
they have to pack it.

79
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,033
They pack it full of stuff and so you're
all clogged up and they took big chunks 

80
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:54,880
of the bone out of the inside because 
what do they call it?

81
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,763
Turbinates or something like that.
I had a bunch of scar tissue 

82
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,080
calcification here.

83
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,080
Sees when someone has cauliflower ears.
Yes.

84
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,150
Yeah.
Fighters.

85
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:03,984
Usually you get that in your nose too if
your nose has been broken a bunch of 

86
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:07,280
times because what?
What?

87
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,320
That cauliflower ear is his blood under 
the surface of the skin calcifies and it

88
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:13,524
becomes essentially a rock.
Have you touched someone's California 

89
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,493
in?
It's literally like there's a rock in 

90
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:18,750
there.
It's really kind of crazy.

91
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,883
Will you get that inside your nose to 
when your nose had been broken a bunch 

92
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:23,334
of times and it bleeds in the inside the
tissue and then it turns into this 

93
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,180
really hard thing that blocks all your 
sinuses,

94
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,700
so if you put a hole in it,
what happens?

95
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,990
It's a rock.
It's a rock.

96
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:35,700
Okay.
It's calcium rock.

97
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,780
Have you ever seen those videos of like 
cysts when they drain the cysts?

98
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,650
Do you ever see that lady's a instagram 
page Dr?

99
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,291
Pimp?
No,

100
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,300
because I don't want to throw up.
You need to go to Dr Pepper.

101
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,790
He's going to do it.
Isn't he doing it?

102
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,230
She's great.
She's hilarious too.

103
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,160
She.
She like.

104
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,050
She loves it.
She thinks and fun.

105
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,120
I bet you get to a zillion views to.
Oh my God,

106
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:58,470
she's got more instagram followers than 
me,

107
00:04:58,471 --> 00:04:59,161
I think.
Wow.

108
00:04:59,161 --> 00:04:59,994
How many?
She got point nine while she doesn't 

109
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,380
have as many as me,
but she is.

110
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,273
She has a lot.
Did you ever have bad acne at any point 

111
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:09,210
in your life?
I had some pretty decent acne when I was

112
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:13,530
in high school or get a good one.
How about that one?

113
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,341
It.
Yeah,

114
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:15,174
that one.
When you had your cursor on try that 

115
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,124
one.
That one looks like they're going to 

116
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:21,680
open that sucker up.
Don't nothing.

117
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,140
Nothing.
Let's keep going.

118
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,500
Still going.
That ain't shit.

119
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:28,710
Okay.

120
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,620
I will say that it's a nightmare once.
Let's find some other ones.

121
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,690
Jamie.
The Look of that is disgusting,

122
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,524
but I think it's universally agreed upon
that the feel of getting a big pimple 

123
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:39,660
and popping it properly.
It feels amazing.

124
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,700
Look at this.
Some sort of a cyst.

125
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,400
Someone's head.
Oh,

126
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:45,450
can you stop it?
Yeah.

127
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:49,130
He's got a bulging system.
Looks like a fucking eyeball dude.

128
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,210
Oh,
it's like a marble.

129
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,410
Oh my God.
I'm never good again.

130
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,410
Elite again.
You'll fine.

131
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,480
Oh,
I just want to eat any cysts.

132
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,093
Yeah.
That's like the side of someone's head 

133
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,400
weight and it didn't even actually like 
totally pop out either.

134
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,563
While those things are stuck,
I mean that's part of your skin's 

135
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,663
protein tissue.
I used to have pretty bad acne when I 

136
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,054
was younger and I had accutane.
They gave me accutane and that stuff 

137
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,254
worked.
I mean they say that there's a small 

138
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,420
chance that like I guess in maybe one 
percent or point,

139
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,350
oh,
one percent of cases.

140
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,183
Some people got depression and so they 
said there's a risk of suicide with 

141
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,940
this,
but I never.

142
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:30,941
It never affected me in that way at all.
And it really just zonked your sebaceous

143
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:33,070
glands and your just good.
Like it just,

144
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,940
it's almost a cure.
Yeah.

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,460
My friend Andrew Santina had it for the 
same reason,

146
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:40,050
but he said he got the side effect is 
there.

147
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:40,671
He did,
yeah.

148
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,504
On one hand it was amazing because the 
skin cleared up and the other hand he's 

149
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,580
never felt so bad and it's alive.
Wow.

150
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,433
Yeah,
but you don't know what to do because 

151
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,960
you feel bad if you have acne,
feel bad if you take the medication,

152
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,420
but the medication will knock out all 
the acne.

153
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,560
Well,
I also take,

154
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,090
I don't take accutane anymore,
but I actually take finasteride for hair

155
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,300
and they say trump takes that to.
And then there were some doctors,

156
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,134
I don't know how credible this is,
where there were some doctors who were 

157
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,430
like,
that stuff is not that great in terms of

158
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,293
mental health.

159
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,950
No,
that's Propecia,

160
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,784
propecia and the same thing,
same thing in inhibits 

161
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,664
dihydrotestosterone,
which does cause depression and some 

162
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,084
people I think are,
are he said that his depression was 

163
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,410
linked to when he started taking 
propecia.

164
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,180
I take it.
I don't,

165
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,400
I've never.
It's never affected me that way.

166
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,360
It decreases your testosterone though.
Kills Your boners.

167
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,370
Well,
mine are all right there.

168
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,610
All right.
How would they be if you didn't take it?

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,740
I guess double or triple.
You tell me.

170
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:39,470
I don't know,
but the thing is I wouldn't look good.

171
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,080
I feel like you really pull off a bald 
head very nicely.

172
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,880
Whereas I'd look like a leukemia 
patient.

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,330
Do you think so?
I do get a decent sized head dude.

174
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,111
I mean,
come on.

175
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,490
I wouldn't look good,
but look at me.

176
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,983
First of all,
I would have to go to the gym way more 

177
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,640
than I do now and I'd have to get 
tattoos everywhere to look.

178
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,533
Yeah,
if you want to look like a bad ass with 

179
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,730
a bald head,
of course you do.

180
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,400
There's this guy,
there's this wrestler for Wwe,

181
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:05,510
I forget his name,
but he had really long greasy hair,

182
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:06,344
like the typical wrestler hair.
And then he recently decided to shave 

183
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:11,750
his head and he pulled it off nicely.
It looks way better with a bald head.

184
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,950
He had,
um,

185
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,563
he,
he's just one of those guys where you 

186
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,780
looked gross with the really long hair 
that was greasy.

187
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:19,370
But when you got,
when you went bald,

188
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,570
okay,
now you look normal.

189
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,523
That Greasy Harrison new thing.
It's like the John Wick hair greasiness 

190
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,221
in the hair.
Yeah.

191
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,200
When remember when Keanu reeves was John
Wick,

192
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:29,120
it was always greasy.
I don't remember that.

193
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:29,954
No,
it's a good movie to listen to or watch 

194
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,840
rather when you're on the treadmill.
This is doing a cardio challenge,

195
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,680
a good one tag.
Greasy.

196
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:39,770
But it seems like Gel people make fun of
me because Gel they say uh,

197
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,600
so like 19 nineties and I'm still 
wearing it.

198
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,400
Creature of habit.
It's just chill.

199
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,383
It's available.
People will make fun of you for 

200
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,190
everything.
That's true.

201
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,480
Yeah.
Give them a chance,

202
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,373
dude.
I did a powder on my face the other day 

203
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,680
because I was under these lights and I 
did feel silly as I put it on.

204
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,150
It's a little weird.
Like,

205
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:58,660
why can't I just be shining?
Yeah.

206
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,080
What's going on?
People terrified of sweat.

207
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,040
Yeah.
The problem to me was pasty and shiny,

208
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,070
so super white and shiny and it just 
looked gross.

209
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:12,570
It looks like I'm unhealthy.
So of you were like a bronze bronze.

210
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,810
That's slightly better but still kinda 
gross.

211
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,400
So you were saying that you got into it?
Well you asked Chris Christie something.

212
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,010
Oh yeah.
Political,

213
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,990
political or what is political as Jamie 
was saying,

214
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,780
it's like comicon for political dorks.
Exactly.

215
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,400
That's exactly correct.
Yeah,

216
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,110
and it's weird because what they do,
Joe,

217
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,150
is they invite like,
um,

218
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,540
like establishment media figures and 
some politicians,

219
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,673
but then they also invite new media 
figures like me and our worlds do not 

220
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,930
mix.
Yeah.

221
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,980
Yeah.
In fact,

222
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,600
many of them,
I don't even think many of them knew who

223
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,220
I was.
Meanwhile,

224
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,560
when you actually go to the people who 
were there,

225
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,623
you know,
it was all the new media people who are 

226
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,780
getting the most attention,
right?

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,833
Where you have guys like Bill Kristol 
walking around who was in the Bush 

228
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:57,480
administration and people are like,
who?

229
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,403
Who are you?
So it's a very weird thing going on 

230
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,024
there.
Well,

231
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,073
Kudos to them for recognizing that new 
media has such a place and it's just 

232
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,874
media.
I mean at this point I think that this 

233
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,940
whole concept of new media versus obese,
it's just media,

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,740
but there's independent,
uncensored untethered media,

235
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,330
which is why one more popular.
Yeah,

236
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,403
of course.
Yeah,

237
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,523
exactly.
Tribe watching one of those ABC 

238
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:28,860
nightline or one of those fucking 
political shows,

239
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,723
terror and then try watching something 
on youtube where people get to be free 

240
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,500
with their language and free with their 
expression,

241
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,110
not beholden to any executives are 
producers and yeah,

242
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,440
so they get it but they don't get it,
get it.

243
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,870
Because when I went to the Chris 
Christie thing,

244
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:47,790
they had it in this giant room and about
25 percent of the room was full and then

245
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,760
for one of my debates that I did a few 
panels but one debate,

246
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,170
they put me in like the smallest room 
and we had all the seats full and people

247
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:58,980
standing up and packing the room so they
get it but they don't get it.

248
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,840
Get it to,
to them,

249
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,790
the new media people are kind of like an
afterthought.

250
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,100
Like okay,
we'll have them because you know,

251
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,600
they should be here,
but they don't.

252
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,260
They don't realize that the draw is not 
Chris Christie.

253
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,430
The draws,
the new media people.

254
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,590
Well Chris Christie and that's not just 
me,

255
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,300
but I just wanted to clear up under 
anymore.

256
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,610
He's not.
I mean like who is he?

257
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,820
Why would they think that he could fill 
a place because he's been on tv a lot,

258
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,740
but I want to be clear.
I'm not even just saying,

259
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,210
oh,
leftwing new media,

260
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:26,430
which obviously is what I would be,
but even the Ben Shapiro types,

261
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:28,110
of course he has a big audience when he 
comes.

262
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:29,180
He's got a giant.
Yes,

263
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,540
exactly,
but it's so.

264
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,390
It's all the new media people who are 
popular and the rest of them are not.

265
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,620
Did you go to some sort of a concert 
while you were there?

266
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,610
Oh No,
this is.

267
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,633
But they gave you.
This is how you got in the building 

268
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
without them giving you a hard time to 
keep it forever.

269
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,580
No,
I just haven't.

270
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,260
I didn't think about snipping it off 
yet,

271
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:47,940
but now I'm wishing I did because we 
were talking about it.

272
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,730
There's some dorks that go to coachella 
and they keep the fucking thing.

273
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:51,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

274
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,020
No,
this is.

275
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,410
This is coming off soon.
I'll tell you.

276
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:53,980
Not Scared to

277
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
take that big ass knife.
I'll cut off a finger by accident if I 

278
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,990
use that thing.
It'd be fun.

279
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,940
Just so everybody knows,
this is what I'm talking about.

280
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,700
Jamie just gave you a pair of scissors 
if you want those.

281
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,331
Oh yeah,
I'll do that.

282
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:07,164
So anyway,
don't take it off under pressure me if 

283
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:10,414
you want to keep it on.
I'm not a bracelet guy in the first 

284
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,660
place.
So that's a weird thing to be a bracelet

285
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,520
guy.
Like a lot of beads,

286
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,500
like you're really trying hard to be 
spiritual.

287
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,210
Here we go and that's not me or ice.
If you want a diamond it up.

288
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,090
Like if you're a rapper and you and a 
lot of ice on your wrist.

289
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,610
I did use to wear earrings.
I did use to do that.

290
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,960
And I see in your face that you want to 
mock me at this moment I had earrings.

291
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,913
Oh you did?
You probably had the old nineties hoop 

292
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,990
earrings.
I had a hoop and a diamond stud,

293
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,240
but it wasn't even a diamond.
It was a cubic Zirconia.

294
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,493
Yeah.
And has it ever happened in the history 

295
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:47,820
of the world that you know,
a,

296
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,080
a woman has walked up to a man and said 
to a man,

297
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,310
you know,
I wasn't attracted to you,

298
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:54,940
but then I saw your earring probably 
happened in the eighties.

299
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,830
Somebody probably said something like 
that in the eighties.

300
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,510
Just just because you're so bold,
you've got a hole in your ear.

301
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,460
Took a chance.
Yeah.

302
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:05,920
I guess that had a counter culture vibe 
to it.

303
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,933
You hearing little cutie man,
you had a baby face know the other 

304
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:13,240
things just to earpiece.
That's a hook.

305
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,120
That's the thing that goes back to hold 
it in place.

306
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,160
So you only had it on one ear.

307
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,613
On the left hand side,
it didn't go like full rockstar with a 

308
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,923
double hoops.
Axl Rose Word on the street is that if 

309
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:26,194
you only do the right ear,
you're supposed to be a signal that 

310
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,310
you're gay.
That was the word at one point in time.

311
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,170
But is that true or is that just people 
talking?

312
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,150
Shit.
Oh,

313
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,473
I don't know.
I had it on my left ear because that's 

314
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:38,370
what I had heard.
I remember that too,

315
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,213
like don't you,
if you could do both and that's not 

316
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:45,700
considered gay,
but if you did the right ear alone,

317
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,590
that was considered good,
but if you did both,

318
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,290
either a pirate or you're in a band.

319
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,703
I did have both at one point and it's 
funny because when people see old 

320
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,030
pictures of me,
they say I either look like the Jersey,

321
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,903
like a jersey shore wannabe or like a 
backstreet boys wanted me because I 

322
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,530
looked because I had the earrings in and
I had the hair totally spiked and yeah,

323
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:08,380
that was the style at the time.
While you're also running a risk because

324
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,450
you've got like a little bit of facial 
hair.

325
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,441
Yeah.
Yeah.

326
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:14,020
I don't have a very masculine.
No a beard,

327
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:14,854
but you've got something going on.
You're definitely a man or a woman 

328
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:22,420
undergoing hormone replacement therapy.
You got that Chaz Bono type thing.

329
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:23,254
It's um,
this is called a lazy man's beard 

330
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,490
because I can't even even really grow a 
beard.

331
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,530
So it's just this is what it is when I 
get lazy.

332
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,060
You got a little something going on 
though?

333
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,840
Yeah,
I guess so.

334
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,990
Maybe it's the finasteride just had the 
mustache itself.

335
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,820
That would be kind of creepy.
No mustaches.

336
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:40,660
I'm going on a jihad against mustache 
because I think for whatever reason they

337
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:43,630
look more ridiculous than full facial 
hair.

338
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,070
I don't know why.
Some people like,

339
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,410
like Sam Elliott,
the actor.

340
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know who that is.
I know.

341
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,000
I know Tom Selleck.
I've seen roadhouse,

342
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,040
but which guy is it enrolled?
Everybody knows who.

343
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,110
It's not the main character of Patrick 
swayze.

344
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,311
Oh my.
Yeah,

345
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:01,440
but he's got the.
He's got the mustache.

346
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,770
What a man.
But the GRANDPA vibe going on,

347
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,980
but he didn't always go to roadhouse.
Go to look at that.

348
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,200
Sam Elliott and.
Yeah,

349
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,043
but he's a great voice.
Nobody's blowing him because he has a 

350
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:15,630
mustache.
Easy blow his fucking game area.

351
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,493
So look,
get that.

352
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,880
Come on.
I mean the one.

353
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,900
Love it with the hair right now there.

354
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,530
Are there that semen roadhouse?
Yeah,

355
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,840
but that's a full beard.
That's more of a full beard.

356
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,580
That's true.
And that looks better on him.

357
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,550
I don't know that.
Oh,

358
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,384
come on now.
I don't think a go to that one right 

359
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:36,284
there.
I don't think a goatee looks as 

360
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:41,300
ridiculous as a mustache alone.
Some guys can pull it off,

361
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,770
you know?
It's a bold choice,

362
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:45,530
but he can't look.
You can't look overly artsy with it.

363
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,560
You know what I mean?
You can't or you can't.

364
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,221
No,
you can't.

365
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,054
If you're,
if it looks like you're tied to your 

366
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,670
goatee as a matter of your identity,
then it's a problem.

367
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,260
But if it's just a dude who seems like 
he's rocking a goatee,

368
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,410
he just decided one day to rock a 
goatee,

369
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:01,244
then it's all right.
You know what kind of died out the soul 

370
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,250
patch,
the soul patch.

371
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,050
Yeah.
I haven't seen one of those in forever.

372
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,070
You know,
that kind of went away.

373
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,780
Did you ever have any facial hair or.
No,

374
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,643
just beard beards.
I grew it way out at one point in time 

375
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,120
because,
uh,

376
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,840
there's a guy named Evan Tanner who was 
an mma fighter that was known for having

377
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:18,430
a big,
thick,

378
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,263
crazy beard.
He was a really interesting guy and he 

379
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,200
really nice guy too.
And he died in.

380
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,783
He went on sort of a walkabout and 
decided to go in death valley and camp 

381
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,050
out and um,
he ran out of water.

382
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:33,884
I couldn't find his water and dying from
heat and a lot of us were pretty broken 

383
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:40,814
up about it.
So a bunch of people online decided to 

384
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,900
grow out our beards for a certain amount
of months.

385
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,000
That's me with a full beard.
Wow.

386
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,310
So you get a almost.
You could get a cave man.

387
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:50,640
Beard going if you wanted to.
Yeah,

388
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,460
I get a full beard.
Yeah.

389
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:57,020
And that's me trimming around the cheeks
because my shit creeps all the way up to

390
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:58,760
my nostrils.
Yeah.

391
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,400
Yeah.
I grew that out for a couple months.

392
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,290
I forget how long we decided to grow.

393
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,950
What are you doing?
Listen,

394
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,873
that was when he wanted to play Robert 
Shapiro didn't need to do that for the 

395
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:15,830
Oj movie.
I feel like it was okay.

396
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:17,270
Maybe it's just,
yeah,

397
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,060
that this verifies every single,
you know,

398
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,120
whisper about John Travolta,
tickle a Baltic or it is just a,

399
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,580
it's right there for typically involves.
Anyway,

400
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,580
so the Chris Christie thing.
Yeah.

401
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,620
So I'm in Politiken.
He's what?

402
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,390
What was he doing exactly?
There you are.

403
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:35,990
Yeah.
You want.

404
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,130
You can play it if you want.
Okay,

405
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,740
please.
Kyle questions.

406
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,480
Chris Christie,
anti marijuana.

407
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:49,980
Watched

408
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,840
that clip like 40 times over.

409
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,470
You pause that for a second.
I just wanna explain that to Joe.

410
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:56,910
I don't know if you know what I'm 
referencing there,

411
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:01,530
but during the Republican primary there 
was one debate where Chris Christie just

412
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,364
totally destroyed Marco Rubio's chances 
of becoming president because he kept 

413
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:08,180
repeating himself over and over,
giving the same talking points and Chris

414
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,910
Christie pointed that out and then Mark 
Rubio did it again and Chris,

415
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:12,480
Chris,
he was like,

416
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,830
there he goes again.
There he goes again,

417
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:14,664
and the room exploded.
And it was that interaction where 

418
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:20,040
everybody where Rubio tanked in the 
polls and finished him off.

419
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:20,874
So my strategy with Christie was,
I'm going to start this off by giving 

420
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:27,120
them credit on something to disarm him,
and then I'm gonna hit him with the real

421
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,170
question for a sport

422
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,423
in regards to the opioid epidemic,
you care deeply about that generation 

423
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,713
to,
to study in the Journal of the American 

424
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,101
Medical Association,
legal,

425
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:45,934
recreational.
Marijuana would help fight the opioid 

426
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:48,454
epidemic,
so knowing that and knowing that 62 

427
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,490
percent of Americans now favor,
favor full legalization,

428
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,620
why not supportive

429
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,430
play out,
let it play

430
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,603
epidemiological studies from Harvard 
Medical School for Stanford to tell you 

431
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:09,850
the exact opposite.
Okay.

432
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:10,684
Pause right there.

433
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,150
His giant problems with epidemiology 
studies and he should know that.

434
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,450
Yeah,
so my studies for sure,

435
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:23,310
epidemic epidemiology studies that 
basically a questionnaires,

436
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,091
you know,
you don't,

437
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:24,924
you don't take into account all sorts of
other issues that these people do in 

438
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:27,714
their lives and also like when when 
you're dealing with those kinds of 

439
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,254
studies,
a person could be doing marijuana but 

440
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:35,730
also be drinking a lot but also be doing
other things.

441
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:39,480
So if what the argument is that it's a 
gateway drug,

442
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,930
the only way that argument works is if 
you somehow or another track someone and

443
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:47,094
saw that marijuana made them change 
their opinion on doing other drugs 

444
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,043
because a lot of these people are just 
doing drugs and they do marijuana as 

445
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:55,981
well.
Shouldn't say,

446
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:56,814
well look,
we've shown these through these 

447
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:58,824
epidemiology studies that marijuana is a
gateway drug because they started 

448
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:04,350
smoking marijuana and then they went to 
do heroin.

449
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,390
They probably were going to do heroin 
anyway.

450
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:07,300
Yeah,
exactly.

451
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,660
That's really what's going on.
Sure.

452
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,450
There's no fucking gateway drug.
That whole idea has been dismissed.

453
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,420
That's like saying water is a gateway 
drug to rape every rapist,

454
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,630
drinks,
water,

455
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,910
you know?
It really is the almost that stupid.

456
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,850
So do you think that when there was a 
little bit of applause,

457
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:24,684
because he answered me quickly,
do you think that that beginning of the 

458
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:27,684
applause was for my question or for him?
Him saying no and respond hundred 

459
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,460
percent for you because we were debating
that.

460
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:34,710
I wasn't sure.
Now let's do it again.

461
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,570
Play it again.
It's really clear.

462
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,443
Why not?

463
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,730
I,
I couldn't tell epidemiological

464
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,870
studies for both Harvard Medical Schools
here in this effort,

465
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,310
Stafford,
that tell you the exact opposite and say

466
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,144
that marijuana is still a gateway drug 
and that people who try marijuana 

467
00:20:58,481 --> 00:20:59,314
between the ages of 14 and 18 are three 
times more likely three times more 

468
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:07,921
likely to try opioids or 
methamphetamines than people who don't,

469
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,513
and I just don't believe that what we're
in the midst of a drug addiction crisis 

470
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,690
that we need to legalize and other 
drugs.

471
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,103
Clearly he's got a food addiction.
Food addiction is far more dangerous 

472
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,100
than marijuana.
Marijuana on its own has killed.

473
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,053
No one ever.
Half a million people die every year 

474
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,700
from being a fat fuck.
That's.

475
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,290
That's the facts.
Yeah.

476
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,580
This guy is a part of a real death 
epidemic and if you were mean,

477
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,593
you would bring that up.
This motherfucker brings a fucking bank 

478
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:47,440
robber size bag of m and m's to a 
football game.

479
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,560
He's ridiculous.
He's ridiculous.

480
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:54,280
Talking about marijuana and marijuana 
being a gateway drug.

481
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,263
The whole idea of it is stupid like 
smoke marijuana or don't smoke 

482
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:58,834
marijuana,
but the point is marijuana doesn't kill 

483
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,920
you.
It's really that simple.

484
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,053
Now,
if you're saying that marijuana causes 

485
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:05,884
you to do all sorts of other things,
you've got to have some direct pathway 

486
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,960
that shows that it changes your 
inhibitions.

487
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,580
It changes the way you think about 
things.

488
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,330
That's never been done.
If anything,

489
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,403
what gets people to try drugs is when 
you tell them that marijuana is 

490
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:22,930
dangerous and then they smoke marijuana 
and go,

491
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:26,440
this is Shane dangerous not doing to me.
I feel great the next day.

492
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,210
There's nothing wrong.
All it does eat a pizza.

493
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,000
You know,
I got a giggle.

494
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,510
I watched a bunch of cartoons.
My friends.

495
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:32,344
We had a great fucking time.
That is the misinformation aspect of it 

496
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,070
is more dangerous than the idea that 
it's a kate.

497
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,980
Some sort of a gateway.
I agree with all of that.

498
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:44,440
Now.
I wanted to pounce when he said that,

499
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:46,570
but you have to understand this was his 
town hall,

500
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,910
so I knew that I was.
First of all,

501
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:49,744
I was going to be shoved to the side 
very quickly anyway because there was a 

502
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:54,340
whole big line behind me.
It'd be wrong about people clapping.

503
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,590
They might have really clear,
he said that was wrong.

504
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:57,424
I'm sure some of the people in the room 
were there to see him and they agree 

505
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:03,280
with him because it was his town hall,
but I wanted to pounce,

506
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,040
but I knew I can't really go back and 
forth like it's a debate.

507
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,820
So what I did is whenever I knew I could
interject just a little bit,

508
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,950
I pushed him on it.
And you're gonna see that in a second.

509
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,260
What is a weird background with like a 
bird?

510
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,720
It's in 19 eighties.
Backdrop that they put up,

511
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,790
but what is it?
What does it say?

512
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,490
It's as political as it says.
Polydoconol with a weird.

513
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,310
A weird drawing is weird,
right?

514
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:25,780
Yeah.
Okay.

515
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,550
But I wouldn't what we do alcohol,
toothpaste back in the tube.

516
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,810
And that's a big important article about
marijuana because once you legalize this

517
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,960
goes back to the two.
You can't do it because we tried.

518
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
It's called prohibition and it didn't 
work.

519
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,560
She didn't stay legal in California 
because it's fine.

520
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,560
Listen,
I hit the states,

521
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,540
have the right to do what they want to 
do on this,

522
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,763
but.
But what I would tell you is that broad 

523
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,860
legalization of marijuana,
in my view,

524
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,953
to alleviate or even minimize your 
current prices and in fact in some ways 

525
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:14,114
may add to it,
and I will also say that I almost never 

526
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,130
agreed with the teacher's union in any 
state anywhere,

527
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,163
but the Colorado Education Association 
has said this year that the single 

528
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,193
biggest challenge for their members to 
educate middle schoolers and high 

529
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,340
schoolers in Colorado legalized 
marijuana,

530
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,683
that kids are coming with gummy bears 
and other types of edibles and their 

531
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:41,400
high school,
their high,

532
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,253
the good part of the time,
and it's making it much more difficult 

533
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:45,134
for them to teach.
That's the Colorado Education 

534
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:49,780
Association.
You,

535
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,530
I'm sure at this very moment,
if they were watching,

536
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,300
will be appalled to know that.
I agree with that.

537
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,900
I agree with them on that,
but it.

538
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:57,770
I respectfully disagree with your point 
of view.

539
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,653
Thank you sir.

540
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,653
So he actually changed his position 
slightly because when he ran for 

541
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:04,774
president he said,
not only am I against marijuana being 

542
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:07,234
illegal at a federal level,
I wouldn't even let the individual 

543
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:12,790
states decide whether or not they want 
legal marijuana.

544
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:13,624
So in other words,
he would prosecute the states like 

545
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:18,130
Colorado and California that have legal 
marijuana using federal law.

546
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,280
And right there he softened his position
slightly and he said,

547
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:22,114
well,
leave it up to the states and let them 

548
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:23,464
decide.
So anything that's because he knows 

549
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:26,650
he'll never be president.
No,

550
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:27,484
I think he still wants to be president.
There's no fucking way I think he's 

551
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:31,030
going to run again.
No,

552
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,650
I don't know if he's going to run in 20 
slash 20,

553
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:35,380
but 20 slash 20 for some serious.
First of all,

554
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,333
the uh,
the odds of that guy's going to make it 

555
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,240
eight more years with that fair point.

556
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,520
Morbidly obese carcass.
He's moving his hand around with does it

557
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,520
need get a stapler?
Didn't he get his stomach fucking suit?

558
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,280
You know,
somebody pointed that out.

559
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:53,500
I didn't know that.
I never saw those stories.

560
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm not denying that it's true,
but I just never heard it.

561
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:56,734
But if he did,
it didn't work while I had a friend who 

562
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:00,720
ate through two of those.
He,

563
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,750
he,
uh,

564
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,400
when you're a d,
that's what I'm saying anyway,

565
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:05,980
about food.
He's addicted to food that's like,

566
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,220
this is unquestionably,
he's an addict.

567
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,910
Do you think anybody's said that to him 
in his life or an I look.

568
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,410
Look how much thinner you go.
Okay.

569
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,710
Okay.
And he did this.

570
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,573
Oh,
I guess he did this before the 

571
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,940
presidential race because he wanted to 
make it.

572
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,900
But then he got fat again.
Yeah.

573
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,343
So he was wrote ton before.
He was like a bag of water before and 

574
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:29,280
then you know,
he,

575
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,700
he trimmed himself down.

576
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,973
Yeah.
And it's funny because I don't think in 

577
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:36,880
any way he realizes the hypocrisy of 
having his own,

578
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,170
um,
you know,

579
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:40,450
issue with food and he would argue,
hey man,

580
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:41,284
listen,
I'm going to eat what I want it to 

581
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:42,544
freedom choice.
But when comes to freedom for somebody 

582
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:46,530
to decide to tweak their consciousness 
slightly,

583
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:48,420
all of a sudden he says,
you shouldn't be allowed to do that.

584
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,740
Well,
that's where it's preposterous.

585
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:50,574
The idea that you mean even with what he
said about alcohol didn't make any 

586
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:55,860
sense.
Like would you make alcohol illegal?

587
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,240
What we try to read,
it's called prohibition.

588
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,720
Okay,
but let's pretend that you had some sort

589
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:05,430
of an ability to keep that from going 
sideways.

590
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:07,380
Again,
let's start from the beginning.

591
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,110
Would you want alcohol to be legal or 
not?

592
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:13,710
If you could wave your hand and and 
there would be no more problems that are

593
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:14,880
alcohol associated.

594
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,833
Would you do that and make it illegal 
versus give a grown adult the 

595
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:25,440
possibility of deciding whether or not 
they want to drink or not drink?

596
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,540
Yeah.
He's not being consistent and his logic,

597
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,620
that's the point is that he's willing to
say I'm thinking about donuts,

598
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,380
but he even.
He even mentioned prohibition there,

599
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,120
but that makes my point,
not his point.

600
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:36,954
Yes,
because that's when the mafia got 

601
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:38,664
incredibly powerful because you pushed 
all the alcohol sales underground and 

602
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:42,684
they got all the power and the money is 
a result of it and that's when crime a 

603
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,790
shot through the roof.
So if you want to decrease violent crime

604
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,060
and the drug war.
Yeah,

605
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,020
I mean,
look,

606
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,020
we talked to people in Mexico and the 
United States and our hunger for illegal

607
00:27:55,981 --> 00:28:00,300
drugs is a reason why the cartel got so 
huge when we were kids.

608
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,170
When I was in high school,
there was no Mexican cartel.

609
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,610
Yeah.
It was never discussed.

610
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,110
It was not an issue.
There was no discussion whatsoever about

611
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:14,520
violence from Mexico.
That is an incredibly recent thing.

612
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,480
In fact,
I did MTV spring break,

613
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,203
I want to say it was back in 2002.
I was hosting this spring break thing 

614
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:28,524
for MTV when fear factor was just on the
air and it was like one of those 

615
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:37,580
publicity things that we did and there 
was no worries about going to Mexico.

616
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,260
Mexico 10 was nothing.
It was just like,

617
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,160
hey,
we're going to Mexico.

618
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:41,611
Okay,
cool.

619
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:42,031
It's like,
hey,

620
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:44,520
we're going to go to new.
Mexico was no different.

621
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,360
Yeah.
You know,

622
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,160
and now it's like you're going to 
Mexico.

623
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:47,994
What about the gangs?
What about the violence would have put 

624
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,200
the cartel people would go to Tijuana 
all the time.

625
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,190
And you would worry because it was seedy
and crazy and you know,

626
00:28:56,191 --> 00:29:00,990
it was a lot of pickpockets and thieves,
but it was never cartel violence.

627
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,640
Cartel violence is literally within the 
last 15 years or so,

628
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,060
and our strategy had the opposite of the
effect they wanted.

629
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,980
So you get rid of El Chapo and you 
think,

630
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:12,690
okay,
if the decapitation strategy,

631
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:14,730
we got rid of the top guy,
now we're good.

632
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,683
But what happened is you had his cartel 
became fractionalized and then you had 

633
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:19,944
people fighting who were top officials 
in his cartel and they both wanted to 

634
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:24,564
become the head guy.
And so then there's a war between those 

635
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:27,174
guys and their gangs in the street.
So it's the exact opposite of what they 

636
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:32,250
say they want,
which is let's decrease the violence and

637
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:33,960
make sure everything's running 
peacefully.

638
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:36,450
And also an amazing fact that I just 
learned about a few weeks ago.

639
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,530
There are 200,000
deaths that have happened as a result of

640
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,640
the drug war.
200,000

641
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,960
that's crazier in America.
Know the US and Mexico.

642
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,420
That seems low.
You think that's low?

643
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,890
I thought that was so high.
I mean,

644
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:52,720
I guess because it's been going on since
Reagan,

645
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,010
so one would think,
okay,

646
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:55,660
it's more Nixon.
I'm sorry Nixon,

647
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:56,580
not Reagan.
Right,

648
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,770
but that was like inside the United 
States,

649
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,190
but it'd be like how do you classify 
like what was done because the drug war,

650
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:10,500
you'd have to go with all the stuff that
happened in Vietnam with heroin.

651
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,020
I mean how many people were killed 
including via.

652
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,863
I think this is just for theu ,
s and Mexico and I think it's tied to 

653
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,403
what we were just talking about,
the cartel violence and then people get 

654
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,980
caught in the crossfire and they get 
their lives destroyed.

655
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,160
It still seems low to me.
Yeah.

656
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,780
And it's over a trillion dollars has 
been wasted on this.

657
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,010
I'd be interested in talking to someone 
who is an expert,

658
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,003
get Chris Christie on,
but who's a real expert on Mexico and 

659
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,870
what happened with the cartels,
the rise.

660
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,703
The cartels because I'm sure there was 
always organized violence in organized 

661
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:45,070
crime,
but like what happened where it exploded

662
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:46,840
to the point where.
I mean,

663
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,703
I was just talking to a friend of mine 
who said he won't go to Mexico and I'm 

664
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,150
like,
I've been in Mexico,

665
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:52,210
man,
Mexico is great.

666
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,313
I was talking about a Punto Meta.
You ever go to [inaudible] to me now 

667
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,520
it's beautiful.
It's like near Puerto Vallarta.

668
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,290
It's gorgeous.
So beautiful.

669
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:04,291
But we were.
We were staying at a resort and A.

670
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,213
I was with my family and they have these
golf carts that you could drive around 

671
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:11,440
the resort on and we said,
let's go to the town.

672
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,573
Let's go see what that.
There's a town right outside of the 

673
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:15,730
resort.
Let's go see what it's like.

674
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,210
You go out of the resort in a block.
You hit a military station where there's

675
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,620
men that are standing by on armored 
vehicles.

676
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,180
So I said to my wife,
I said,

677
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:30,850
do you know why they're there?
They're there to guard the resort.

678
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,920
I know that's what this is.
And she's like,

679
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:34,000
you really think so?
I go,

680
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:34,834
I know.
So why are they standing here on top of 

681
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:38,134
this?
They have these steel plates with 

682
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:40,894
machine guns.
These guys have flak jackets on and 

683
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:46,510
they're standing there on top of these 
military vehicles standing there.

684
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,673
I'm like,
well,

685
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,420
they're ready.
They're on standby.

686
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,000
This fucking thing is right outside the 
gates of the four C's.

687
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,293
Yeah,
there to make sure that they protect 

688
00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:00,280
their tourism industry.
Yeah,

689
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,350
and that's all directly tied to the drug
war will.

690
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:05,610
The drug war has had a massive impact on
Acapulco Aco.

691
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,260
Poco used to be the place where 
everybody would go.

692
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,123
They said the Vegas of Mexico and they 
were trying to rival Vegas and now 

693
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,200
that's where they say there's mega 
cartel violence.

694
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,990
They don't even call them cartels now,
and I will say there are mega cartels.

695
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:19,480
They're fighting for more power.
Well then not only that,

696
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,343
there's been some violence where they 
purposely killed people that were 

697
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,560
staying in resorts to sort of send a 
message like,

698
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,900
oh my goodness.
Yeah,

699
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,390
and there's dead politicians to where 
they found these mass graves.

700
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:32,224
Did you hear about that?
Every now and then they'll stumble 

701
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:38,050
across a 200 person mass grave and then 
whoever's not being killed,

702
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,420
they're usually being by the cartels.
So some experts.

703
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:44,990
I've said this is literally a narco 
state at this point and I'm curious what

704
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:45,824
this new guy's going to do because 
there's new guys supposed to be 

705
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,500
anticorruption and hopefully,
I don't know what his position is on the

706
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,450
drug war,
but I'd be surprised if his position was

707
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:54,261
not,
hey,

708
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:56,960
let's find another way to do this 
because now world opinion has shifted.

709
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,780
I mean,
in the US,

710
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,590
62 percent of the country says let's 
legalize marijuana.

711
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,920
And that's honestly,
I think people are thinking that without

712
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:08,510
even realizing that there's a giant 
spike in crime because it's illegal.

713
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,280
They don't even know.
Yeah,

714
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,173
I agree.
And there are also killing journalists 

715
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,750
in Mexico.
They're killing police.

716
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,800
There's a lot of people that are dying 
in Mexico because the cartel violence,

717
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,083
you know,
we were talking about that Jamal could 

718
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Shogi guy before the podcast started and
how disturbing this whole thing is.

719
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,720
And for folks who don't know what we're 
talking about,

720
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,700
fill people in on.
Okay,

721
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,840
sure.
So,

722
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,780
uh,
Jay Mollica Shogi is uh,

723
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:35,614
a journalist who actually worked for the
Washington Post and he went into the 

724
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,693
Saudi embassy in Turkey to get a 
marriage license in Istanbul to get a 

725
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:48,470
marriage license.
So for him and his wife and he never got

726
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:49,970
out,
they killed him,

727
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,250
dismembered him,
used a bone saw,

728
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,430
and then they even went as far as to 
cover it up or they had a body double go

729
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:56,264
in and they gave him a fake beard and 
they had him wear his clothes and walk 

730
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:00,060
out.

731
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,970
Is there video of the body double?
There is,

732
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,230
there is.
In fact,

733
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:04,064
CNN had it.
I know yesterday I was looking at the 

734
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:07,280
CNN video that had it.
Um,

735
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,690
so yeah,
Saudi Arabia,

736
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:11,180
now brazenly killing journalists.
And I'll tell you what,

737
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,370
you came up with a bunch of different 
versions of the story.

738
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,570
Oh yeah.
But why they did it.

739
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,770
Here's the body.
There you go,

740
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,190
there's him and then the guy on the 
right with hair.

741
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,740
Why would they have a guy with hair as a
body double?

742
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,550
Think about how much this had to be 
planned out to have a body double.

743
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,770
Right,
but why they give the body was bubble.

744
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,950
If you're going to be a body,
double shave your head dude.

745
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:31,310
The other guy's bald.
That's crazy.

746
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,780
So they didn't even do a good job at 
faking their murder,

747
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:37,760
but it's the worst fake ever.
Yeah,

748
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,320
because the guy's got a full head of 
hair.

749
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,083
Yeah.
It's not great.

750
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,550
Not Terrible.
How shoes onto.

751
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,310
He had different shoes.
Yeah,

752
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,170
I mean that's,
that's the worst body double.

753
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,960
It's got dark hair and they're saying 
this is the guy.

754
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,610
Look,
he's fine walking around.

755
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,890
No issues at the body.
Double Knot.

756
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:55,790
A hair double.
I guess.

757
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,600
I mean if you're going to have a body 
double shave.

758
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:02,450
The guy's fucking heads how you walked 
in those different shirt and everything.

759
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,950
Oh,
that's a body devil.

760
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,860
So says hair color is different too.
I mean,

761
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:09,020
he's got dark hair.
This guy's got gray here.

762
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,273
The thing that's driving me nuts about 
this is so now at this is getting a lot 

763
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:15,740
of press attention and I'm happy it's 
getting a lot of press attention,

764
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,380
of course,
but the reason why it is is because he's

765
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:19,214
part of the elite class in the sense 
that he's a journalist and now you have 

766
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,580
the people from the New York Times and 
the Washington Post and CNN,

767
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,890
they can relate and they go,
oh my God,

768
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:25,730
they're killing journalists.
Now.

769
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:27,680
This is crazy.
Look at the precedent that this sets,

770
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,680
but what people don't know is for the 
past two or three years,

771
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,573
Saudi Arabia has been waging a literal 
genocide in Yemen and that's not an 

772
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:36,830
exaggeration,
so they've blockaded the.

773
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,003
They're not allowing in medicine.
There's a cholera epidemic happening 

774
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,790
there.
Millions of people are sick.

775
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,833
They have people dying of starvation 
because they're not allowing in food or 

776
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:47,070
humanitarian aid.
They're bombing hospitals,

777
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:49,560
they're bombing schools,
they're bombing open air markets,

778
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,430
so they're doing a literal genocide and 
that got very little coverage,

779
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,550
but then with this journalist now 
finally starting to get some coverage,

780
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:57,384
but I'm curious what happens moving 
forward in terms of how will the US 

781
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:00,594
respond to it,
because as I'm sure you already know 

782
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:02,994
this,
I mean they care more about that 

783
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:06,690
$110,000,000,000
weapons deal that they just had with the

784
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:10,230
Saudis than they do about the lives of 
humanities or the lives of journalists.

785
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,393
Yeah.
The.

786
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,910
The idea of him being really valuable.
It's not.

787
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,970
It's not just that he's a part of the 
elite.

788
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:20,980
It's that there was a conspiracy to do 
so that they think came from upon high.

789
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,903
Yeah,
and there was 15 people that they're 

790
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,414
saying,
I flew in from Saudi Arabia and one of 

791
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:30,810
them was a forensics expert who knows 
how to cover up evidence,

792
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,090
knows what evidence is,
what's like a movie.

793
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,390
It feels like a movie.
The bone saw things that been confirmed.

794
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,810
They know that well at a bone saw.
I heard that now the nickname for him in

795
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:42,330
Washington DC is a,
what would they say?

796
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:45,540
Bone saw a solomon,
his name is Mohammed bin Salman.

797
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:47,430
They're calling them bone saw Solomon or
something like that.

798
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,321
Yeah,
dude,

799
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:50,154
it is.
The stuff that's going on is just scary 

800
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:54,450
to me and then there's also some 
interesting geopolitical stuff happening

801
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:55,284
around this.
The head of Turkey is now using this as 

802
00:36:57,361 --> 00:36:58,194
an issue to try to snuggle up to the US 
because he's got ambitions where he 

803
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,154
wants to like recreate the Ottoman 
Empire and of course Muhammad Bin 

804
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,843
Solomon,
he has ambitions where he wants to 

805
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,374
dominate the Middle East so you have at 
the same time this weird ego battle 

806
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:15,000
between [inaudible] and Mohammed bin 
Salman and they're all trying to suck up

807
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:18,430
to the US to basically get it so that we
can.

808
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:23,470
We do favors for them and we allow them 
to expand and on top of that,

809
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,640
the story's changed multiple times,
right?

810
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,493
It's a story of what,
five times first they said nothing 

811
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:30,780
happened to them,
to him.

812
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:35,130
Then they said we walked out fight and 
now they're saying that he was killed by

813
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:38,040
people who overstep their bounds.
That's right.

814
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,410
Yeah.
They keep changing the story and there's

815
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,253
also stories that the.
The consulate has video and audio 

816
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,030
evidence of the murder.
That's what Turkey saying?

817
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,873
Yeah,
but they don't want to release it 

818
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:50,664
because then people will know how 
they're spying on them when they visit 

819
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:54,930
the consulate.
I guess,

820
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,850
so I didn't see that,
but I'll take your word for it.

821
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,470
Yeah,
that was.

822
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,303
See if you can find that.
That was one of the things that was 

823
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:00,834
brought up yesterday that they don't 
want to release this video and audio 

824
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:05,784
evidence because if they do,
then other people will know how they're 

825
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,480
spying on them when they visit.

826
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,040
Yeah,
I could see that.

827
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,510
I mean they should immediately cut off 
the arms,

828
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:16,344
deal with Saudi Arabia.
No more weapons for a regime that's 

829
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:19,644
doing the stuff that they're doing and 
we already knew that they behead people 

830
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:25,050
in the public square for sorcery,
sorcery.

831
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,010
Do they really?
Yes.

832
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Sourcery for witchcraft to see for drug 
smuggling that they behead people in the

833
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,390
public square for those things.
Well,

834
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,610
the the drug smuggling,
that's a real problem.

835
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:41,611
But you don't want any sourcery sourcery
man.

836
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,260
Did you ever watch that movie Dr.
Strange.

837
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,390
Look,
you can get out of strange love.

838
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,224
I think I saw a strange.
I've never seen marvel comics character 

839
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:54,490
that there was a movie in 2017.
He's one of the avengers.

840
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:55,670
You know who Dr.
St Jude.

841
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,760
I have A.
There's another thing I'm waging.

842
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:02,310
Jihad on are a comic book based movies 
and I'll tell you what,

843
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:03,580
I'm going to get a lot of dislikes for 
that.

844
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,320
But.
So you didn't like black pants?

845
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,440
You know,
I,

846
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,380
I bought a panther.
I did not,

847
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,220
but I racist.
You must be racist Bro.

848
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:15,890
You got me.
I didn't see what condo forever.

849
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,283
Actually the last one I saw was Batman.
Which the Christian Bale one and just 

850
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:21,880
the voice alone,
the voice alone.

851
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,600
I said,
fuck this.

852
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,100
You didn't like it.
I couldn't stand it.

853
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:24,881
I said,
that's so fake.

854
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,280
I have to go.
But my brother in law made a good point.

855
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:27,971
He was like,
yeah,

856
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:31,330
but he's playing Batman and that's even 
more fake than the voice.

857
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,640
So why is it the voice that turns you 
off to it?

858
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:34,474
But I don't know.
I just have a weird thing with 

859
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,700
superheroes because we know what's going
to happen.

860
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,563
Oh,
the superior swoops in and saves the 

861
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:39,560
day.
Yay through.

862
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,503
Yeah.
I was going to live.

863
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,710
Give me something interesting.

864
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,663
But the new avengers movie had a lot of 
twists and turns like the hall couldn't 

865
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:47,860
be the hulk even when he was getting 
angry.

866
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,570
Spoiler spoiler,
spoiler.

867
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,933
It fucked up the movie.
The fucked up the movie because the 

868
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:56,620
whole couldn't be the.
Why the fuck do you have the hall?

869
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:57,820
Because he can't be the.
Oh wait,

870
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:00,700
I'm lying.
I saw the hole with Edward Norton.

871
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:02,020
Was he the hulk?
And one of the movies?

872
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,510
He was the Hawk way back when I saw that
one too.

873
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,900
The Hawk.
Now I call them Buffalo.

874
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,000
Mark Buffalo.
Yeah.

875
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,310
Because why not?
He's a real.

876
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,940
He's an activist,
but he's certainly very vocal.

877
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,260
Yeah.
I don't know much about him.

878
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:19,150
I just know I call them buffalo.
Why?

879
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,740
Because why not?
It's funny.

880
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,590
I laugh at it.
That's all the matters for you.

881
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,900
That's all that matters.
He's a,

882
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,500
but he's that guy.

883
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,230
He's always tweeting about political 
stuff and social social issues.

884
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,630
It seems like.
Very progressive.

885
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,380
Very Open minded or at least very 
active.

886
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,810
Sure.
Constantly talking about stuff.

887
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

888
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,753
You're not buying it.
I just don't know anything about Mark 

889
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,030
Rothko so I can add nothing of 
substance.

890
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,520
I can't be the hulk and still be that 
guy.

891
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,820
I don't know.
It's one of my favorite superheroes.

892
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,650
So he was the hope to buffalo.
He's the new Hawk now.

893
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,630
He's the new home.
Yeah,

894
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,320
he's been the hulk for the last few 
years.

895
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,400
Don't you hate how Hollywood just 
recycles the same stuff over and over?

896
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,140
Well,
the crazy thing to me is spiderman,

897
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:02,380
because it's been like 80 spiderman and 
whenever a guy gets famous,

898
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:03,310
be inspired by band,
he's like,

899
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:04,300
hey,
look a little more money.

900
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:05,740
They go,
fuck you.

901
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,500
You're going to make a new spiderman.
Yeah.

902
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,390
But they go with the surefire things 
that they know will make money.

903
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,220
Yeah.
And that's the superhero stuff.

904
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,473
Well,
you could definitely relaunched 

905
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:17,410
spiderman and the hulk till the cows 
come home.

906
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,930
And I guess Batman too.
But the Ben Affleck,

907
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:21,730
Batman people like.
Nah.

908
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,740
See that's another one I would never 
watch.

909
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:25,720
Not Ben Affleck.
That's the fucking.

910
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,830
That's the no redoing superman again.
Now I'll think God thing.

911
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,950
You know what?
If I was a woman right now,

912
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,330
be pissed.
Where's the Goddamn cat woman movies?

913
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,950
Huh?
We're super woman.

914
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:41,210
Why has there not been a catwoman or a 
super?

915
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:45,110
Was the last time there was a cat one 
and really very long ass time ago,

916
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,360
there'll be another one.
Give it time.

917
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,343
They need to.
One hundred percent of women were 

918
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,480
getting discriminated against in the 
world of superhero movies is only wonder

919
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:56,000
woman.
And she sought his fucking half naked.

920
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,890
Who played wonder woman?
Gal Gadot.

921
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,100
Oh,
that's the Israelis something.

922
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,130
Wasn't she in the IDF Israeli military?

923
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,070
I think she was.
Yeah,

924
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,050
she,
uh,

925
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,090
Marquez.
Who was just here.

926
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,060
Marcus Brown.
He was,

927
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,953
he was showing how she got busted.
She was doing some campaign for Huawei 

928
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,680
phones and she tweeted it using an 
iphone.

929
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,730
See that?
I hate that man.

930
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,970
I would only push a product that I 
really agree with and believe in.

931
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,833
I have a friend who was doing Samsung 
commercials and the entire time he was 

932
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:33,980
using an iphone and he was like,
if they catch me using an iphone,

933
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:37,700
they'll fire me and I don't care if I'm 
using a fucking iphone.

934
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,830
So he had his iphone and the Samsung 
phone,

935
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:42,350
but he never used a samsung phone.
All his friends,

936
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,030
he would text everybody or that you 
would do.

937
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:48,350
We'd do on the iphone.
Why wouldn't they just hire somebody who

938
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:53,351
loves Samsung and is popular because 
they could do that better yet.

939
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,910
They should just looks.
It's not like Sam.

940
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,400
This was a long time ago though.
I want to say that,

941
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,253
that this was probably six,
five or six years ago and back then the 

942
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:07,634
phones were not as good.
Like there was a big difference between 

943
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:10,814
the iphone and android phones.
Now there's not really that much of a 

944
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,490
difference.
They're both pretty fucking awesome.

945
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,593
Yeah,
and I think that they just hire someone 

946
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:22,790
who's got some fucking integrity and 
doesn't lock [inaudible] yeah.

947
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,110
How about that?
Yeah,

948
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,003
I'm kind of married to iphone by default
because I've been stuck with it since 

949
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:27,874
the iphone four and I'm just too lazy to
like because I don't even know exactly 

950
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:34,670
which things transfer over.
If I were to go to a totally new phone,

951
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,410
you know what I mean?
Like obviously nothing almost,

952
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,393
but what about my number?
Would they be able to do that with my 

953
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:39,290
number at least,
or no?

954
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,190
No,
no.

955
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,063
Real.
Even your number would be a giant issue 

956
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:45,980
because you're married to the right chat
or I'm.

957
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:46,903
I've messaged and that I messaged thing 
we were talking about in the last 

958
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:50,714
podcast that I bought a pixel and I 
tried to switch over to a pixel from an 

959
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:55,004
iphone and my text messages wouldn't go 
through it because everyone was texting 

960
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,500
me using an I message and it wasn't 
sending it to a pixel.

961
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,220
It was sort of turn to text then send to
you?

962
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,143
Nope.
Nope.

963
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,250
So that it was just disastrous.
Well,

964
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,113
they're,
they're basically making it incredibly 

965
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:12,944
difficult for you to switch.
So I even called up apple and have them 

966
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:19,480
take out my email from their system 
because I know my email is attached,

967
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,500
the imessage,
so take this out for the system,

968
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,900
kill my message,
just kill the whole system.

969
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,070
Still wouldn't work.

970
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,820
I had wound up going back to apple.
You mother fuckers.

971
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:28,723
I don't know how because I know you've 
spoken about it many times so you're 

972
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:34,360
kind of a techie in the sense that you 
always get like the new phones and stuff

973
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:35,820
here for with that.
No,

974
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,400
one of the dumbest techies that's ever 
walked the face of the planet,

975
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,380
but I was to say I don't know how to do 
with stuff.

976
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,120
I'm into stuff.
I like stuff,

977
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:42,954
but I don't.
It's like a guy who really likes cars 

978
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:48,510
but as zero idea how they work.
That's prudy.

979
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,040
That's me.
Yeah.

980
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:53,670
But you still go through the hassle of 
ordering it and.

981
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,601
Yes.
Yeah.

982
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:55,434
That seems like a pain in the ass.
I would use the same phone for 10 years 

983
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:59,460
if I could.
Really?

984
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,960
Yeah.
It's just not something I think of.

985
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:01,770
What do I use it for?

986
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,070
I use it to text people and every now 
and then call and that's it.

987
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,053
I am fascinated by technology and I'm 
always interested in where it's going 

988
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:10,734
and what they've got going on next and 
now and what's the latest and the 

989
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:15,330
greatest augmented reality is 
fascinating.

990
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,180
We were talking about that.
That's really interesting because that's

991
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:19,800
supposed to be the next big thing,
right?

992
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:23,100
The how we could see because the phone I
have,

993
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:24,810
it's a,
not a new new iphone,

994
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:28,500
but you could do augmented reality games
on so I could look like they're building

995
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:30,480
blocks in the middle of this table and 
play a game where,

996
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:32,180
you know,
whatever member.

997
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,113
When pokemon was hot and people are 
driving down the street playing pokemon 

998
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,143
in their car,
they were driving crashing into trees 

999
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:42,210
and shit.
Yeah.

1000
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,410
Yeah.
I remember that.

1001
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,330
I used when I was a kid,
I loved pokemon.

1002
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,373
Pokemon came and went so quick.
The point where everyone was using 

1003
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:54,130
pokemon for like months.
Yeah.

1004
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,013
And then it stopped.
You're talking about the new one that 

1005
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:56,730
everyone's using.
Yeah.

1006
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,620
I'm talking to back.
When did we all a game boy?

1007
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,170
I used to play it as a kid and then if 
you go back,

1008
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:04,080
like I tried to turn it on maybe two 
years ago to just see what it's like.

1009
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,610
It is the shittiest most basic game 
ever.

1010
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,873
It's pretty wack.
It's pretty wack in comparison in what 

1011
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,500
it showed me when people really got into
that pokemon game is that people have,

1012
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,423
people are very easily amused and it's 
easy to turn them onto some new latest 

1013
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,420
trend in latest trend being.
What did you have to do jeff,

1014
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,970
to go out and get things.
What are the,

1015
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,090
when,
when you had to walk to where there were

1016
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:35,720
pokemon who were going to fight you and 
then you would,

1017
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:36,630
I think fight them.

1018
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,180
And then if you beat them,
you have them in your collection,

1019
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,690
your video game,
but not the newest one.

1020
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,993
Fight them would you use.
So my understanding is you go into the 

1021
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:46,944
APP and by the way,
people can be made fun of me right now 

1022
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:50,340
because I could be wrong.
And you're walking around with the phone

1023
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:50,941
and you say,
Oh,

1024
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,200
okay,
down the corner,

1025
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,370
uh,
and make a right.

1026
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:56,760
And that's where I see a pokemon and 
then you go down there and then,

1027
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,623
you know,
you fight that pokemon and I guess make 

1028
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:02,490
your stronger and catch that one I think
is the way it works.

1029
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,650
You sound like you're bored by that 
concept.

1030
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:08,551
Yeah.
Yeah.

1031
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:09,280
It wasn't.
I,

1032
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,310
I did it like once or twice and then I 
was like,

1033
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:12,893
I guess it was also one of those things 
where people were losing weight because 

1034
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,624
they were walking around a lot,
so they were touting the positive 

1035
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:18,600
benefits of it.
Like look,

1036
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:19,434
people love walking for miles kind of 
cardio compared to the cardio you've 

1037
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:23,034
been doing is like absolutely nothing.
They're not like sprinting to get a 

1038
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:26,710
pokemon.
You're just.

1039
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,440
The Cardio I've been doing is totally 
unsustainable though.

1040
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:30,274
I've got five hours one day yesterday,
five and a half hours and then another 

1041
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,111
hour at night.
Dude,

1042
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:38,080
isn't that going to like hurt your knees
seemed good.

1043
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,420
Everything seemed pretty good right now.
Everything's great.

1044
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,880
Wow.
So everybody listening right now,

1045
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:45,490
you guys are lazy bitches because he ran
for five hours.

1046
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,383
What did you do?

1047
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,760
It's not smart.
It's like A.

1048
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,970
I used to make fun of people that did 
ultra marathons and stuff like it's not,

1049
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,813
it's not unhealthy.
Like I'm not doing myself a service by 

1050
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:00,400
doing this.
Like my body's like Jesus Christ.

1051
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:01,234
Dude.
Like when I get home at night and I 

1052
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:03,760
crashed,
I crashed hard.

1053
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,080
Do you sleep better?
Tired.

1054
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,680
I sleep like a brick and then I wake up.
I'm like really?

1055
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:12,270
Already get up.
And I'm like fuck,

1056
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,113
I got to get to the gym within 30 
minutes because I have a podcast in 

1057
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:16,384
three hours.
I have to get a solid two and a half 

1058
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,650
hours of cardio in.
In the morning.

1059
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,810
Yeah.
Solid two and a half hours.

1060
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,060
Eighty percent.
You know,

1061
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:28,690
so I'm cranking.
I mean it's hard and I'm listening to.

1062
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,613
I was listening to stuff to blow your 
mind when they were talking about a 

1063
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:38,080
flying creatures are quite so quantile 
and terror attack titles and the origins

1064
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:38,914
of the quantal.

1065
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:44,290
A myth in as tech Mexico.
And you could watch like the full length

1066
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:50,290
movie of the titanic as your workout.
I've watched a bunch of movies,

1067
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:52,030
like yesterday I watched two solid 
moves.

1068
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:53,320
I finally got to see,
get out,

1069
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,150
never saw.
Get out was great.

1070
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,290
It was.
I really liked.

1071
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:58,210
That was a very,
very good move.

1072
00:48:58,211 --> 00:48:59,400
Those again,
movie like,

1073
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,700
God,
that girl is so evil.

1074
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:04,800
Spoiler alert.
Second Annual Pokemon go fast draws over

1075
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:09,340
21,000
attendees in Chicago.

1076
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:12,020
So there's over 180,000
people that played Chicago.

1077
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,443
Remember,
do you remember when Hillary Clinton is 

1078
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,223
still played it?
Do you remember when Hillary Clinton 

1079
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,430
said,
all right everybody,

1080
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,000
I need you to poke a mon,
go to the polls.

1081
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,900
And then everybody in the audience was 
like ditching.

1082
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,090
You never saw that.
No.

1083
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,360
Now you're,
you're,

1084
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:36,430
you're a progressive but you're not 
necessarily a democrat.

1085
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,870
Well,
I mean,

1086
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:42,871
you're not necessarily like in support 
of anyone who's not a loyal Democrat.

1087
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,140
So I describe myself as populous left.
That's how I would describe myself.

1088
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:48,580
Populist means,
you know,

1089
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:51,550
I support the policies that would help 
ordinary people.

1090
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,910
Um,
and I vote based on the issues.

1091
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,660
And so if there's a politician that's 
for the policies I'm for,

1092
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,030
that's what I'm going to support and 
that's what I'm going to argue for.

1093
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,130
Um,
so I'm very,

1094
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:05,380
very critical of what we call corporate 
Democrats,

1095
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:09,910
which are Democrats that represent Wall 
Street and represent big Pharma and,

1096
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:10,744
uh,
the military industrial complex and for 

1097
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:12,964
profit health insurance companies.
And I'm super critical of the 

1098
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:16,990
Republicans also.
So,

1099
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,103
you know,
that's why I co founded a group called 

1100
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:22,000
Justice Democrats.
And the whole idea was to basically do a

1101
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,600
populace,
left takeover,

1102
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,560
the Democratic Party where you get rid 
of the corporatists in the party and you

1103
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,870
have people who will represent the 
working class.

1104
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,300
And uh,
we've been pretty successful so far.

1105
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:36,860
They're still 26 justice Democrats were 
in the running and they can get elected.

1106
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,410
And there were,
here's an amazing fact.

1107
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,244
There were four politicians in the House
of Representatives that didn't take any 

1108
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:46,220
corporate PAC money.
There's about to be 41.

1109
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,130
And that'll happen because of Justice 
Democrats.

1110
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,290
Our evolution,
which is Bernie Sanders Group,

1111
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,550
uh,
the d triple c,

1112
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,384
which is another left wing organization.
And basically what's happening is a 

1113
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,093
people on the left who actually care 
about the substantive issues are 

1114
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,870
standing up and saying,
we're not going to take it anymore.

1115
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,793
And we're tired of being lied to by 
politicians and we want people who are 

1116
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:08,690
going to actually represent us and 
represent working people.

1117
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,630
You know,
that's a,

1118
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,543
I love that.
And I love that approach and there's so 

1119
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:17,030
much partisan politics and there's so 
many people that are just married to the

1120
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:17,864
idea of being connected to the Democrats
that they're willing to overlook some 

1121
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:23,960
really heinous faults.

1122
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,620
Any old blue just won't do as Nina 
Turner says that,

1123
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:28,454
and I love that phrase,
great phrase because it's so just hacky 

1124
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,190
and partisan to be like,
no,

1125
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,530
I'm on your team,
so are you going to vote for me here?

1126
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:37,364
Let me do some platitudes and some 
cliches about how we're stronger 

1127
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:41,750
together and we're going to break down 
the barriers.

1128
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:43,040
And you know,
it's like,

1129
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,820
well,
I don't overtly hate minorities,

1130
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:48,050
so vote for me.
It's like,

1131
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:49,330
oh,
what a low bar.

1132
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,060
Give people something to vote for.
That's a great point.

1133
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,710
I felt a lot of that during the Hillary 
Clinton campaign.

1134
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:00,290
Everybody was like anything but trump.
So we're going to vote for her.

1135
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,450
But boy,
if,

1136
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,420
let's just be honest,
if you had a viable like Tulsi.

1137
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:07,030
That's right.
Tulsa Gabbert,

1138
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:07,983
great candidates.
You had Tulsi Gabbert and she was 

1139
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:13,490
running for president and she's also a 
woman and she's also left wing,

1140
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,360
but she cares about the issues.

1141
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,180
She cares about the issues.
And she's Ernest.

1142
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,580
Yes.
Like when you talked to her,

1143
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:20,414
you can tell she just isn't.
I mean she's careful with her words 

1144
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:26,180
because she's intelligent,
not because she's deceptive.

1145
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,073
Yeah.
And I would vote for her in a fucking 

1146
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:29,870
heartbeat.
There you go.

1147
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,240
I was just,
we just messaging each other.

1148
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,580
She was messaging me about my netflix 
special and I said,

1149
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:37,220
run for president.
I want you to run for president.

1150
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,270
I mean,
that would be wonderful.

1151
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:41,030
I'm slightly fucking wind man.
I think she can,

1152
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,893
but I think she could win.
I'm slightly butthurt about Tulsi 

1153
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,830
because when I was on your podcast last 
time,

1154
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,650
I plugged her in talking about how 
awesome she is.

1155
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:49,484
In fact,
I think I'm the one who originally 

1156
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,770
showed you who she was.
Right.

1157
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:54,830
Did you know before?
Maybe in that podcast many people.

1158
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,660
So you had heard about.

1159
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,670
Well anyway,
she comes on the show are definitely one

1160
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:00,200
of them.
She comes on the show and talks about.

1161
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:02,300
Yeah,
new media is a awesome and there's a lot

1162
00:53:02,301 --> 00:53:04,070
of great people out there.
She goes,

1163
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,933
Jimmy Dore,
and then there's a pause and then you 

1164
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:08,210
move onto the next topic.
And I'm like,

1165
00:53:08,211 --> 00:53:09,290
God dammit,
Tulsi,

1166
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,940
I've plugged you,
plug me Bro.

1167
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:12,803
I know I'm being incredibly petty and I 
don't even really mean what I'm saying 

1168
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:18,110
because I would still support her as a 
sanitation 100 percent.

1169
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,003
So I mean it bro.
This is some salt and it's headed your 

1170
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:23,990
way to also show.
Remember now?

1171
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,711
No,
but she's great.

1172
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:26,750
She's great.
The issues and um,

1173
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,590
yeah,
she's a genuine person.

1174
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,690
That's what,
that's what I got out of her,

1175
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,590
like what I got from talking to her.
She's a genuine person and man,

1176
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,310
I mean maybe it's because she's from 
Hawaii and it's just a different place.

1177
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,203
It's like,
it's almost like a state that's a small 

1178
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:42,750
town.
I mean that's.

1179
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,850
Hawaii is very small.
Yeah.

1180
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,890
I mean there's a million people in 
Honolulu,

1181
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,993
but you get outside of Honolulu,
there's only a hundred thousand on the 

1182
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:52,350
big island.
I don't know how many Maui has,

1183
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:54,240
but I think it's only got a couple of 
hundred thousand.

1184
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,060
I've never been to Hawaii before,
but it fucking great.

1185
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:59,740
It looks like a paradise.
I mean the best is alumni.

1186
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,940
If you want to go somewhere and just 
chill ax,

1187
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,043
there's a four seasons and Lanai.
The entire island has 3000 people 

1188
00:54:08,431 --> 00:54:09,390
living.
Oh Wow.

1189
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,750
It's great.
And you get real island.

1190
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:13,930
Hawaiians.
Sure.

1191
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:18,150
They're not like if you go to Maui,
they're wonderful people.

1192
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:20,310
They're great,
but they've been groomed.

1193
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,940
You know what I'm saying?
People have taught them how to talk like

1194
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:24,774
regular white people.
Whereas in my alumni they're just 

1195
00:54:28,321 --> 00:54:30,170
fucking chilled out man.

1196
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,730
And they just,
they have that way of talking,

1197
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,020
you know,
they talk and you know.

1198
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:39,030
But pigeon is no,
it's a real interesting sort of A.

1199
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,600
I guess it's like a dialect of English 
he would call it,

1200
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,530
but they have really cool expressions.
Like some of the,

1201
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,580
they say a lot of things it will choke 
like a,

1202
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,443
like if you talk about like what guy was
explaining to me how many deer there 

1203
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,560
were in this one place it goes,
oh,

1204
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:58,290
it was a choke dear there was choked 
dear.

1205
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,180
So it's Kinda like a broken English with
different words sprinkled.

1206
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,423
It's interesting.
Use different words for different 

1207
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:04,884
things.
You'd have to be around them all the 

1208
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:07,590
time,
but there's also like a,

1209
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,770
just a way of talking.
It's very,

1210
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,390
very interesting.
That's kind of like,

1211
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:15,000
I think it's called pad wall.
Maybe it's called.

1212
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:18,240
I think it's a people who are Jamaican 
who speak in English,

1213
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:21,030
but it's very broken English and 
probably real similar.

1214
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:21,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

1215
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,510
And they love to say bumble clot.
What does that mean?

1216
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,540
Blood clot?
I think mccullough.

1217
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,900
I think that's what it means,
right?

1218
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,450
Blood clot.
I know they also say blood clot.

1219
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,820
They say blood clot a lot.
I think so,

1220
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,590
yeah.
That should come up very rarely.

1221
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,310
I mean,
unless you're a doctor,

1222
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,500
I guess it's a way of saying stuff,
you know,

1223
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:42,540
something's terrible,
but it means motherfucker.

1224
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,330
Oh mother bag.
That's what bumper caught means.

1225
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,990
Not even close.
The widest God is everyone in this room.

1226
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,630
I guess the technical needs,
blood clot,

1227
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,853
blood clot.
It's a medical term basically talking 

1228
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:56,360
about sutures.
Yeah.

1229
00:55:56,361 --> 00:55:57,300
That's funny.
Yeah,

1230
00:55:57,301 --> 00:56:00,360
but that flight to Hawaii must be.
It's not bad.

1231
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:02,550
It's five hours from here.
It's five.

1232
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:04,770
I'm coming from New York.
Do you fly here?

1233
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:06,450
You hang out for a couple days and you 
fly there.

1234
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,463
Interject again.
Top definition on urban dictionary says 

1235
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:12,840
it's a cloth rag to wipe ones anal 
region.

1236
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,813
Oh,
that was my second guess would be the 

1237
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,773
Bumblebee Bumba cloth.
So bumble clot was some asshole who's 

1238
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,010
wiping his ass.
He's a cloth.

1239
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,340
Like you'd constantly

1240
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,950
a douchebag cloth wipes,
but as a,

1241
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:32,130
as a word to replace like fuck or the 
asshole or something like swipe right.

1242
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,020
It's awesome.
I love that.

1243
00:56:34,021 --> 00:56:35,120
I'll be blast waves.
Yeah.

1244
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,390
Yeah.
I haven't heard that one.

1245
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:38,890
Oh Wow.
Last time I'm here to ask white.

1246
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:43,090
I haven't heard that in a long time.
That's like Beavis and butthead.

1247
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:48,580
David,
you're such a butt wipes anyway.

1248
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:50,320
You're white.
Yes,

1249
00:56:50,321 --> 00:56:52,610
very much so.
That's clear.

1250
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,840
People can see that when you look at the
potential candidates for 2020.

1251
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,333
Yup.
Um,

1252
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:00,220
who,
uh,

1253
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,150
on the left stands out is Gavin newsome.
He just,

1254
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,440
he comes across as a little too 
politician.

1255
00:57:06,441 --> 00:57:09,370
He and smarmy.
That's how he striking me to you.

1256
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:10,780
You don't let them know.
I mean,

1257
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:13,060
I'm sure if I had a conversation with 
him and we spoke about the issues,

1258
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:14,740
I would agree with him on most of the 
positions,

1259
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:15,574
but I don't know if he really believes 
it in means it because he's a 

1260
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:18,574
politician.

1261
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,323
Politician.
Yes.

1262
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,540
There are politicians who I talk to you 
when I know that they mean it.

1263
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,570
Tulsi Gabbard will be one of those.
Rocana would be another one of those.

1264
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:27,610
We spoke about him on the show as time I
was here.

1265
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:28,743
Um,
obviously Bernie Sanders is another one 

1266
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:30,700
of those,
you know,

1267
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,730
there's a really interesting politician 
and coming out of West Virginia.

1268
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:34,564
Now,
I don't know if you heard about this 

1269
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,584
guy.
His name is Richard Odetta and he's 

1270
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:39,130
running against a Republican named Carol
Miller.

1271
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,473
Get this.
He's running in West Virginia is super 

1272
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:45,280
deep red,
like big time Republican.

1273
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:46,114
Almost the most republican tide probably
with Mississippi is the most 

1274
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,580
conservative area in the country.
So this district,

1275
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:52,743
trump won by 49 points.
There's this Democrat Richard Odetta 

1276
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,273
running.
He's up in a poll against a Republican 

1277
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,020
by five points.
So.

1278
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,870
So you're probably thinking,
how the hell in a,

1279
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:05,050
you know,
a district like that.

1280
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:07,810
Can a Democrat be leading?
And the answer is very simple.

1281
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:08,973
He's populist and he's fighting for 
working people and he's run these 

1282
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,154
amazing ads where he literally gave out 
his phone number and one of the eds and 

1283
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:15,821
said,
listen,

1284
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:17,590
if you're a constituent of mine and you 
have an issue,

1285
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:18,603
call me and I'll tell you what.
If a lobbyist tries to come into my 

1286
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:21,940
office,
I'm going to kick him out.

1287
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,550
I don't want you in my office.
I don't care about lobbyists,

1288
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,473
I care about the people.
And he's running on all substantive 

1289
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,140
issues.
He's taking no corporate PAC money.

1290
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:31,690
He's for Medicare for all.
So this is a guy who,

1291
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:32,591
you know,
and by the way,

1292
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:36,190
he's a veteran in Iraq and Afghanistan 
and he's.

1293
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,750
Yes.
And he did vote for trump,

1294
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,730
and now he's one of trump's harshest 
critics.

1295
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,620
And he said,
listen man,

1296
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:45,040
I thought trump was going to be 
potentially good for working people,

1297
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:47,260
but it just turns out he wasn't good for
working people.

1298
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,093
So for example,
trump ran as an anti outsourcing 

1299
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,643
president.
He was against Nafta and tpp and all 

1300
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:53,980
that stuff.
In trump's first year as president,

1301
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,410
there were 93,000
jobs that were outsourced.

1302
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,780
That's even worse than Obama.
Obama had 87,000

1303
00:58:58,781 --> 00:59:01,330
jobs outsourced.
So when you go through his record with a

1304
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:02,164
fine tooth comb,
even like the unemployment rate being 

1305
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:03,904
low,
that's totally misleading because wages 

1306
00:59:05,171 --> 00:59:06,004
are falling.
So if wages are falling and you can't 

1307
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:10,570
just brag about your economy being 
wonderful and his tax bill,

1308
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:13,450
83 percent of the benefits of the tax 
bill went to the top one percent.

1309
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,630
Would you say the wages are falling?
How much they followed by A.

1310
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,880
They're not keeping up with the pace of 
inflation.

1311
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:22,340
So it's probably about one percent.
So

1312
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:27,080
the point is trump ran as a populist,
but ultimately he was a fake populous.

1313
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:28,670
And he's not really helping to work in 
class.

1314
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:30,480
That's why his tax bill was,
you know,

1315
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,330
he gutted the estate tax for example.
That's not something that doesn't.

1316
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,250
That affects point.
Oh,

1317
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,950
one percent of the population.
So Richard,

1318
00:59:36,951 --> 00:59:37,784
Oh,
Jetta is this guy who voted for trump 

1319
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:40,011
and he says,
hey,

1320
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:42,080
I regretted,
I think trump is wrong.

1321
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:42,914
And basically what he's saying is I'm 
the real populist candidate and he's a 

1322
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:47,084
really inspiring candidates.
Kind of amazing to see a plus 49 

1323
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:51,770
Republican district now potentially go 
democratic.

1324
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,370
And by the way,
he's living proof of the point that I've

1325
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,213
been making since day one.
If you have Democrats who are running 

1326
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,290
and they actually care about the issues,
I'm on a flight for working people.

1327
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,150
That's how you win.
You know,

1328
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,003
the,
the real problem is these labels in the 

1329
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:04,670
first place,
right?

1330
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,860
Like Republican versus Democrat,
like,

1331
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,640
yeah,
the idea that we only have two different

1332
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:14,500
distinct parties that are viable options
in 2018,

1333
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,340
just so fucking stupid to me.
VR system.

1334
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:18,560
I don't like our system.
I don't.

1335
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,140
I like parliamentary systems better.
I wish we had the.

1336
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,200
When you said that the wages don't keep 
up with inflation and so they're down by

1337
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:27,254
about one percent,
but how much is unemployment up on 

1338
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,470
employment is down to three point odd 
percent and that is good.

1339
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:34,304
I'm not saying that's not good,
but you just have to remember that 

1340
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:40,580
that's not a very good economic 
indicator because think about it.

1341
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:41,414
This is an argument that was presented.
I remember back when I was in college 

1342
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:43,664
and a professor was challenging also on 
this notion about unemployment and he 

1343
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:46,454
said,
you do know we can create an economy 

1344
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:50,150
that has zero percent unemployment.

1345
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,130
Right?
And all of us in the flashlight.

1346
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,150
First of all,
we didn't know that.

1347
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,710
Second of all,
how do you do that?

1348
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,510
And he goes,
slavery,

1349
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,453
everybody can be working,
but that doesn't mean everybody's being 

1350
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:01,430
paid or being paid.
Yeah.

1351
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:05,090
So when to use unemployment as like your
top economic indicator,

1352
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,313
it's just a shitty indicator.
It's just not the best thing you can 

1353
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:08,804
use.
Right.

1354
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:09,723
Because even if people were working,
it doesn't mean they're doing what they 

1355
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:12,014
want to do,
doesn't mean they're being paid a fair 

1356
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:13,491
wage.
Dude.

1357
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:18,140
Half of workers in America make $30,000
a year or less is true.

1358
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,540
That's true.
If Jamie wants to fact check me on that,

1359
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:22,460
I'm more than happy to be fact checked.
That's dark.

1360
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:27,410
Half of workers in America makes $30,000
a year or less now,

1361
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:32,411
but what about trump's always citing 
unemployment rates for African Americans

1362
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,260
or minorities that are lower than 
they've ever been before?

1363
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:37,843
That could be true,
but what do you think causes something 

1364
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:40,814
like that?
Is that something that's a trend that 

1365
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:43,274
was established during the Obama 
administration that's slowly but surely 

1366
01:01:45,981 --> 01:01:46,814
moving into the position it's in now and
he just caught that wave or is it 

1367
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,840
directly a result of the decisions that 
he's made while he's in office?

1368
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:54,703
Well,
it does have a lot to do with his tax 

1369
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:57,044
bill because corporations are getting a 
tremendous amount of money in corporate 

1370
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,710
profits are through the roof,
so they're hiring.

1371
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,160
Right?
That's the link to that.

1372
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:04,994
But again,
we come full circle back to the wages 

1373
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:06,974
conversation and remember this is all.
It's temporary because look at what's 

1374
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,220
happening to the deficit.
For example,

1375
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:17,090
now I'm not a like a deficit hawk where 
I think it's such a gigantic issue,

1376
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,280
but the Republicans typically run as 
deficit hawks

1377
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,263
and when you look at the deficit,
it's gone up by 51 percent of all 

1378
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:27,480
American workers make less than $30,000
a year.

1379
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,450
A lot of similar numbers,
but it's all right around that wire.

1380
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,613
So the deficit is skyrocketing and 
that's something that's going to 

1381
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,280
temporarily help,
uh,

1382
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,310
those numbers that you were citing 
before those,

1383
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,550
during the Obama administration,
what was that article?

1384
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:43,650
That's still the case?
Two Thousand 15?

1385
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,603
No,
I'm sure it is.

1386
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,333
I'm finding all sorts of stuff.
This one's serious says that half of 

1387
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,850
jobs in America pay less than $18 an 
hour.

1388
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:51,684
Can trump help?
This is from August of last year since 

1389
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,410
it's fall,
right around.

1390
01:02:55,411 --> 01:02:56,250
How's the car,
Joe?

1391
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,060
It's a house.
A car.

1392
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:57,893
It is a house car?
Yeah.

1393
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:00,960
What was trump supposed to do and what 
did he not do?

1394
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:01,823
Like what,
what was he claiming to do before he 

1395
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,630
went into office?

1396
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:07,200
So first of all,
he said everything at the same time.

1397
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,063
So I could give any answer to that 
question because I'm curious to just 

1398
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:12,084
pick on trump because I was one of the 
loudest screaming about how Hillary 

1399
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:15,983
Clinton was the exact same thing.
She's a politician who throughout her 

1400
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:21,900
career she was on every side of every 
issue and trump,

1401
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:25,020
it was kind of the same thing.
But the thing is trump actually got away

1402
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:29,580
with it because I think the way he acts 
as a politician,

1403
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,773
he acts like he has no filter and he's 
just a straight shooter sitting next to 

1404
01:03:33,451 --> 01:03:34,284
you at the bar.
But the problem is like Rand Paul 

1405
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:37,920
pointed out in the debate,
he said,

1406
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:40,560
Donald Trump is a straight shooter 
without the truth.

1407
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,530
Like he's like pretending to be a 
straight shooter.

1408
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,900
So it depends on what issue you're 
asking you about.

1409
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:46,734
I can tell you what trump said,
you just have to give me the specific 

1410
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:48,714
issue you want to know.

1411
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,613
Like foreign policy.
You won't talk about that for a little 

1412
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:51,120
bit.
Sure.

1413
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,680
So on foreign policy,
you know,

1414
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:56,850
half the time Donald Trump said,
and there's so many tweets of him saying

1415
01:03:56,851 --> 01:04:00,240
this before he was president,
before he ran that we need to get out of

1416
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:01,980
Iraq and Afghanistan.
It's always the time.

1417
01:04:01,981 --> 01:04:03,360
It's so stupid.
Why are we the,

1418
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:05,970
we need to rebuild our own country and 
you know,

1419
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:07,230
those are tweets where I read that and I
go,

1420
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:09,540
I totally agree with that.
Donald trump 100 percent.

1421
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:12,480
But then the other half the time when he
was on the campaign trail,

1422
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,430
he spoke about how,
um,

1423
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,413
you know,
we need to bomb isis to smithereens and 

1424
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:17,604
we need to wipe them out.
And those things are kind of 

1425
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:20,574
contradictory.
Either you bring your troops home and 

1426
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:22,884
you,
you know,

1427
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:25,620
didn't think he would be able to fix 
everything really quickly.

1428
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,540
Wasn't that one of his premises?
Typical trump bloviating like,

1429
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,170
I'm going to be tremendous.
I'm going to be amazing.

1430
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:32,670
It's gonna be the best job you've ever 
seen over.

1431
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,070
It's not a bad impression,
but you're going to change the tone.

1432
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:36,913
Well,
it's because I'm not doing the full 

1433
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:40,140
hand.
You're doing good movement.

1434
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,790
The movement skill I have is the 
movement.

1435
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,650
Joseph Rogan.
I call you Joseph.

1436
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,970
What did you think personally when you 
saw Kanye with that?

1437
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,023
Insane?
He's going to ask you about that to 

1438
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,370
bipolar rant.
Yeah.

1439
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:56,790
I feel kind of bad for him.
I do and I'm not and I want to be clear.

1440
01:04:56,791 --> 01:05:00,210
I'm really not saying that as a partisan
thing because even if Bernie Sanders was

1441
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:03,120
president and Kanye West was in the 
office saying the exact same stuff,

1442
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:04,410
I'd still be like,
Whoa,

1443
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:05,640
what is going on here?
Yeah.

1444
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,100
Yeah.
Did you burn him up the same way too?

1445
01:05:08,101 --> 01:05:13,101
Because I remember when he left those 
black lives matter chick that cost him,

1446
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,320
but just stepped aside.
That really did cost him.

1447
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,320
You think so?
Yes.

1448
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,070
Yeah.
People

1449
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:18,903
do.
You can't do.

1450
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:22,180
You can't just take the microphone away 
from someone you know.

1451
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,350
So here's an interesting question.
Do you think this helped Donald Trump at

1452
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,930
all with black voters having cognac do 
that,

1453
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:31,570
but how much?
A good number really?

1454
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,050
You think so too?
Yeah,

1455
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,660
I do.
I don't know.

1456
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:37,180
I don't know because I feel like there's
A.

1457
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,013
Kanye West has been disinvited from a 
lot of cookouts now as a result of what 

1458
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:41,770
he did with trump.
Jamie's on black twitter.

1459
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,640
Jamie says not at all.
From what I read,

1460
01:05:43,641 --> 01:05:48,641
it did not in black twitter response has
been very negative,

1461
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:51,940
so it was Kinda is really almost in a 
sense,

1462
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,100
blowing his own reputation on this,
I guess.

1463
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,480
I don't think so.
You don't think so?

1464
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,403
No.
I think everyone who's a fan of Kanye 

1465
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,920
West,
who seen him blow up on Jimmy Kimmel and

1466
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,770
blow up on all these different people 
that have criticized him.

1467
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:09,820
He's.
He's obviously got mental health issues.

1468
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:12,880
When he went on that rant,
I think it was in San Jose.

1469
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:14,830
Is that a concert?
He said I didn't vote,

1470
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:18,380
but if I did vote,
he was voted on trump and everybody went

1471
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,480
and then he wound up going into a mental
hospital after that.

1472
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,343
Oh Wow.
Checked into a mental hospital and then 

1473
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:26,740
canceled his tour.
Remember that?

1474
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,633
I do remember that.
That was because he couldn't handle the 

1475
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:29,674
criticism.
That's part of it and also part of it 

1476
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,200
he's legitimately mentally ill.
I mean,

1477
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,034
look,
he didn't marry that lady and be a part 

1478
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:39,160
of that family because he's thinking 
straight.

1479
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,990
He's got some problems.
There's something wrong with them.

1480
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,680
You know,
he's a genius in terms of music.

1481
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,340
He's,
he's,

1482
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:49,210
he's fantastic at creating beats and 
songs and hooks.

1483
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,430
He knows what the fuck he's doing there,
but he,

1484
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:55,420
he's got a problem and you hear it when 
he rants,

1485
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,830
when he's ranting and when he's talking 
about Ford making dope cars.

1486
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:02,560
We don't use the word dope because we 
only use words like magnificent,

1487
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,660
admitted,
positive words like he's,

1488
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,613
he's making.
He's listening to himself and jerking 

1489
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:11,200
off to the noises that are coming out of
his own mouth.

1490
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,123
I love.
I loved when you said to the reporter 

1491
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:14,470
when the report or pushed back and I'm a
little bit,

1492
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,360
he's like,
you just asked me a question.

1493
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,553
No,
you can't do that because is like 

1494
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,620
tasting a fine wine.
It's complex.

1495
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,420
Yeah,
exactly.

1496
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,430
I thought that was pretty funny.
My read on him,

1497
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:26,103
he's he,
I think part of what he's doing is that 

1498
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,713
he's a contrarian and when you are in a 
place like Hollywood and you're there 

1499
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:33,034
all the time,
you're always surrounded by people who 

1500
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:34,924
are anti trump.
I think there's something about just 

1501
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,480
this knee jerk reactionary feeling of 
like,

1502
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:40,391
like,
no,

1503
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:41,380
I'm not with you guys.

1504
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:44,200
I'm different and I'm special as a 
result of being different,

1505
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,750
so I'm a contrarian and I'm going to 
disagree with you.

1506
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:47,703
And then I also think there's narcissism
in the sense that he looks at trump and 

1507
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:55,120
he really sees himself in trump and that
everybody laughed at trump when he said,

1508
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:57,010
I'm going to run for president.
I'm going to win.

1509
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,260
And if you remember a few years ago,
Kanye West said,

1510
01:07:59,261 --> 01:08:00,094
I'm going to run for president.
And everybody was laughing at it wasn't 

1511
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:03,640
even a few years ago.
It was recently.

1512
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:04,690
Yeah,
he.

1513
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:05,524
And uh,
what the fuck's on guys named Piers 

1514
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:07,940
Morgan,
right?

1515
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,030
Right.
Right into it on twitter.

1516
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,670
Who said you're talking to your future 
president?

1517
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:15,530
That's what Kanye said.
Oh my God.

1518
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:19,520
Or maybe it was Harvey Levin.
He said it to you're talking to a future

1519
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:23,240
president actually disliked piers Morgan
more than I dislike Kanye West.

1520
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,920
Kanye on that one.
I think Connie's ill.

1521
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:29,263
Oh really?
Do.

1522
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,720
And I know he's been medicated.
Yeah.

1523
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,090
Remember when he was all Chubby.
When he's on his medication,

1524
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:35,924
you got fat and apparently he got off 
his medication and there are a lot of 

1525
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:38,601
people,
by the way,

1526
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:39,434
who would hear the point you made and b 
would be really angry at the fact that 

1527
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:45,620
you think that he's mentally ill even 
though I think that's.

1528
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:48,050
I've seen it.
I've seen it all my twitter,

1529
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,610
I've seen it on my twitter.
People saying,

1530
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,660
oh,
it's just a cheap partisan hacky point.

1531
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,593
No,
it's not because he's admitted Lee 

1532
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,553
mentally ill.
I mean he did say that and the thing he 

1533
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:57,470
said,
I was diagnosed bipolar.

1534
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:59,310
Institutionalized.
Yeah.

1535
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,273
He spent time in a mental hospital for 
being mentally ill and when you listen 

1536
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:06,890
to him brand,
this is just my opinion.

1537
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,113
That is not the ravings of someone who's
carefully considering the implications 

1538
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,510
of each word they're saying and thinking
about how to express themselves in a way

1539
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:21,200
that's going to portray some sort of a 
clear,

1540
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:24,440
cohesive message is not.
He's not what he's doing.

1541
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:28,040
What he's doing is jerking off.
He's just jerking off with his mouth.

1542
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,930
I'm not kidding.
It's just,

1543
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,940
it's just like,
let me get it out.

1544
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,740
Is the fine wine,
you know,

1545
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:36,790
we gotta we gotta make the dopest cars.
Why can't fly back the dopest cause,

1546
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:37,643
you know.
Did you hear what he said in that same 

1547
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:39,500
thing?
Um,

1548
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,453
the reason why we got to help Larry 
Hoover is because in a different 

1549
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:45,560
universe there are alternate universes.
I am him.

1550
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:49,720
I don't think that's correct.
Lyrics,

1551
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:50,883
song lyrics to a song.
Was it something he says that when he's 

1552
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:53,910
off his Lexapro?
Yeah.

1553
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,210
Oh No,
you ain't seen nothing crazier than this

1554
01:09:56,211 --> 01:09:58,850
Nigga.
When he off his Lexapro.

1555
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:03,950
Remember that time in Mexico?
Remember the law that last time,

1556
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:08,900
the episode asking me why the hell are 
texting code four times just to say,

1557
01:10:08,901 --> 01:10:10,080
don't text me.
Whoa.

1558
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,410
Told you four times.
Don't text me,

1559
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:15,290
Whoa,
and we Finna lose all self control,

1560
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:18,320
but you ain't Finna raising your voice 
at me.

1561
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:23,350
Especially when we end the Giuseppe to 
modern day socrates,

1562
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,910
various man.
It's silly,

1563
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,033
but I love that,
that nothing crazier than when he's off 

1564
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:33,320
his lexapro.
Oh my God.

1565
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,243
Yeah.
I do kind of feel bad even though this 

1566
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:36,670
is such a,
you know,

1567
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,940
like a side show type thing because I 
feel it.

1568
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:39,893
I mean the state of the country so weird
that beach simply because of his 

1569
01:10:42,921 --> 01:10:43,754
celebrity and the fact that the 
mainstream media doesn't know how to 

1570
01:10:45,651 --> 01:10:46,700
keep their eye on the ball.

1571
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:51,240
You never know who can become president.
It could be somebody like Kanye.

1572
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:55,430
You're underestimating trump.
Not The guy who said he could win,

1573
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:57,350
but you knew you would.
And I did too.

1574
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:58,184
I mean,
I set it on my last Netflix special and 

1575
01:11:00,101 --> 01:11:00,934
one before my last one.
I don't think Kanye West has a goddamn 

1576
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,440
snowball's chance in hell of being.
Okay,

1577
01:11:06,441 --> 01:11:07,274
I see what you're saying.
I don't think anybody that's famous can 

1578
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,364
be president.
I think what trump did was map some 

1579
01:11:12,111 --> 01:11:17,111
master manipulating skills combined with
some super human energy that most likely

1580
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:22,140
came from diet pills.
What I think is his ability to campaign,

1581
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:22,974
his ability to maintain his energy and 
keep ranting and raving and fucking 

1582
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,550
phenomenal.
He,

1583
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,120
Hillary couldn't keep up with that.
She,

1584
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:30,983
she,
she literally didn't campaign places 

1585
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:34,740
because she didn't have the energy.
That's what I was breaking down.

1586
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:35,603
No,
he trump went directly to the rust belt 

1587
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,293
and railed against Nafta and the trade 
deals that destroyed their lives and 

1588
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:43,560
Hillary Clinton.

1589
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,080
I mean Bill Clinton is the one who 
didn't have to.

1590
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,023
Yeah,
and she didn't campaign and a lot of 

1591
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,030
those states because her campaign 
genuinely thought like,

1592
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:51,841
oh,
we got those.

1593
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:54,150
Those are democratic lockups,
and then guess what?

1594
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:57,300
Trump ended up winning because of 70,000
votes in the rust belt.

1595
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,030
So it directly.
Because of that.

1596
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:00,864
That's why I get so angry when there are
some people on the left who like only 

1597
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:04,614
focus on the.
Some of trump's supporters who are 

1598
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:10,410
racist and all they want to do is talk 
about how bad of people they are.

1599
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:11,161
It's like,
okay,

1600
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:15,600
you could shame people all day long.
That's not going to get them to vote for

1601
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:16,980
you,
but I agree you don't.

1602
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,600
You don't need the David Duke's to vote 
for you.

1603
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:19,434
That's fine,
but you know who you do need the two 

1604
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:22,560
times Obama voter,
who then flipped to trump who was in the

1605
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:24,420
rust belt,
who had his fricking job outsourced.

1606
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,750
That's who you need and that's what the 
Democrats abandoned the.

1607
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:32,100
The problem with saying that all trump 
voters are racist too is you're.

1608
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:37,130
You're creating these very clear sides 
and it's a way to whitewash or loss.

1609
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,370
It's a way to say,
listen,

1610
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,353
we don't have to change in any way 
because it's just because these people 

1611
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:45,390
are bad people,
so don't blame us.

1612
01:12:45,391 --> 01:12:47,550
There's nothing we did wrong.
Blame then.

1613
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,593
Whereas if you really were interested in
winning and getting power and 

1614
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:52,860
implementing your agenda,
you want to.

1615
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,960
If you want to reach whoever you can 
reach.

1616
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:55,794
Now again,
I'm not saying you tried to get David 

1617
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:59,790
Duke or Richard Spencer on your side 
because some people are too far gone,

1618
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,180
but 70 percent of the country is not too
far gone.

1619
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,130
No.
So you should have went to the rust belt

1620
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:06,143
and you know,
tried to get the two times Obama voter 

1621
01:13:07,561 --> 01:13:09,270
who then flipped to trump and they 
didn't do that.

1622
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,010
Well,
I think there's also,

1623
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,920
there was some real benefit in someone 
like Bernie Sanders,

1624
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:14,754
just like a thing.
There's some real benefit in someone 

1625
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:16,854
like Obama socially.
Whereas when you saw a guy who was came 

1626
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:22,704
from a single mom who was a black guy 
who winds up being the president of 

1627
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:26,730
United States,
you just go,

1628
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:28,470
wow,
maybe we're better than.

1629
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:29,310
I thought.
We were like,

1630
01:13:29,311 --> 01:13:31,140
maybe we don't have all these 
prejudices.

1631
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:33,900
Maybe there's less of us than people try
to claim.

1632
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:39,500
And I think a guy like Bernie Sanders 
could have been a real full oil.

1633
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,833
It could have been a real.
He could have been a guy that if you 

1634
01:13:44,941 --> 01:13:45,774
looked at what trump stood for,
trump stood for the outsider who 

1635
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:51,060
understands the game because he hired 
those people,

1636
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:53,280
he paid those people,
he bribed those people,

1637
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,860
and now I'm going to clean up the swamp.
Yes,

1638
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:56,700
drain the swamp.

1639
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:01,700
And on the other side you've got this 
deeply flawed woman who's deleted 30,000

1640
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,310
emails who's beholden to all the Iraq 
war,

1641
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:08,250
the Iraq war.
But how about the Patriot Act?

1642
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:11,230
Warren was spying on all Americans,
which she supported every time there was

1643
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:15,730
a major issue where it was really a test
of character and ideology was wrong.

1644
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,500
Well,
and then when you go into her,

1645
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:21,310
her thoughts on gay marriage,
she didn't believe in gay marriage.

1646
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,880
So 2013.
Yep.

1647
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:24,003
Which is like,
that is one of the least progressive 

1648
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:29,620
things you could ever say.
Like you didn't believe it until 2013.

1649
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,481
Yeah.
Like what?

1650
01:14:30,481 --> 01:14:33,050
Why not like you think it should be 
between a man and a woman.

1651
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:36,460
Like what does that even mean?
It means you're trying to pander to what

1652
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:39,220
you think is the majority sentiment in 
the religious country.

1653
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,180
Yes,
you're going.

1654
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,440
Exactly.
Meanwhile,

1655
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:44,500
Bernie Sanders is the fundamentally the 
opposite of Hillary Clinton.

1656
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,870
Didn't agree or disagree with him for 
the past 30,

1657
01:14:46,871 --> 01:14:47,704
40 years.
He's had the same ideology saying the 

1658
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,380
same stuff.
Yes,

1659
01:14:50,381 --> 01:14:51,214
very,
very progressive and maybe he's totally 

1660
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:57,640
wrong about some of his socialist ideas.
Maybe it would bankrupt the country.

1661
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,560
Maybe some of his.
I don't think it would.

1662
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,650
I don't think it would have been.
Maybe it would.

1663
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,420
Maybe it would be catastrophic to our 
economy to have this guy.

1664
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:07,973
Maybe it would be bad.
Maybe it would be the opposite of what 

1665
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:11,284
we're dealing with right now with in 
terms of the progression of 

1666
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,273
unemployment,
where unemployment is at an all time 

1667
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:22,351
high and that or all time low rather,
where when you're looking at people that

1668
01:15:23,351 --> 01:15:24,184
are doing well in this country because 
of some of the things that trump's 

1669
01:15:26,381 --> 01:15:27,214
implemented,
whether it's people that are getting 

1670
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:33,520
lower wage jobs than they would like to 
have or whatever it is.

1671
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,353
When you look at the numbers,
maybe those numbers would go in the 

1672
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,700
other way.
So,

1673
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,650
but my point is what he represents 
though is someone who's not corrupt.

1674
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:44,620
What he represents as someone who's not 
beholden to banks,

1675
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:46,660
but he represents someone who doesn't 
care about money.

1676
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:48,430
It's not as thing.
It's never been his thing.

1677
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:52,540
His thing has been social justice,
whether it's right or wrong,

1678
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:56,050
at least it would represent something 
entirely different.

1679
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:01,420
Whereas with Clinton represented was 
corruption with a different taste to it.

1680
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,240
So what I would say,
I agree with a lot of what you just said

1681
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,500
there in terms of Bernie,
I.

1682
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:07,573
I personally wouldn't use the term 
social justice for him because that has 

1683
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:13,030
social justice warriors now.
Yeah.

1684
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,530
It's a thing on the internet and you 
know everybody.

1685
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,393
It's basically what I think of when I 
hear Social Justice Warrior is over 

1686
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:20,034
sensitive college kid with pink hair 
who's trying to diy platform 

1687
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:23,650
conservative speakers now.

1688
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:24,783
Right?
But that's unfortunate that it's become 

1689
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:26,620
that.
Well,

1690
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,250
I mean,
listen,

1691
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,230
let's,
let's take the way social justice,

1692
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,470
let's say progressive ideology.
Okay.

1693
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:33,304
Say that.
But what Bernie Sanders actually 

1694
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:37,300
represents in my mind,
and based on his record,

1695
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,134
is what he wants to do is make this 
country like every other developed 

1696
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:42,994
country on the planet that's already 
kicking our ass in so many relevant 

1697
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,270
areas.
So there's this common argument,

1698
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,104
which is nothing but a straw man 
argument that comes from the far right 

1699
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:54,520
where they say Bernie Sanders and his 
ideology,

1700
01:16:54,521 --> 01:16:58,450
he wants to make the United States like 
Venezuela or like Cuba or sometimes even

1701
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,460
say like the old Soviet Union.
Well,

1702
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,353
no,
if you actually go issue for issue 

1703
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:03,933
pretty clearly what he's asking for is a
Swedish or Norwegian type system which 

1704
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:11,780
is similar to the u,
except the major difference is they have

1705
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:12,614
universal healthcare.
Some of these places have universal 

1706
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:14,924
education.

1707
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:15,913
So,
and uh,

1708
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,480
you know,
middle class wages are higher.

1709
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,750
So what he's asking for is a better 
mixed economy.

1710
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:24,440
It's called social democracy.
He's asking for a social democratic type

1711
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:27,050
system.
It is not post capitalist.

1712
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:29,630
It's not saying let's totally scrapped 
the system and let's all,

1713
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:30,464
you know,
act like wear whatever Hugo Chavez or 

1714
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:33,260
Che Guevara,
what he's,

1715
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:34,183
what he's asking for is actually,
I would call it moderate in an 

1716
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:37,514
international sense because he looked at
the rest of the developed world and he 

1717
01:17:39,591 --> 01:17:40,520
goes,
man,

1718
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:44,110
these guys are kicking our ass on 
healthcare education their ass and what,

1719
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:46,250
what parts of the developed world.
So,

1720
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,930
uh,
when you look at healthcare for example,

1721
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,823
there's a study that came out from the 
Commonwealth Fund which found that the 

1722
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,513
United States ranks 11th out of 11 when 
it comes to developed countries in 

1723
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:55,653
healthcare.
So we have worse health outcomes and 

1724
01:17:57,741 --> 01:18:00,410
it's more expensive and we don't even 
cover everybody.

1725
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,180
We have 29 million people who are 
uninsured.

1726
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:05,090
So when you go there,
there are single payer systems and their

1727
01:18:05,091 --> 01:18:10,091
systems beat us in every measurable 
health outcomes based on what you have.

1728
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:12,913
Someone who goes to the doctor.
Worse outcome in terms of what happens 

1729
01:18:17,061 --> 01:18:17,894
once you've been checked in or you would
have to look at the methodology of the 

1730
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:21,224
study.
I don't know the answer to that off the 

1731
01:18:21,561 --> 01:18:22,394
top of my head.
That's a big issue is because we have a 

1732
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:26,090
giant problem obviously with our diet,
you know,

1733
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,170
and.
Sure I'm not.

1734
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,900
I wouldn't deny that for a second.
How much have.

1735
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,920
I wonder how much of it is based on 
that.

1736
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,290
When you're dealing with worse health 
outcomes,

1737
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,124
like how much of that health,
how many of those health problems are 

1738
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:38,563
based on people's personal choices 
rather than the healthcare system that 

1739
01:18:41,691 --> 01:18:42,470
they're operating under.

1740
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:43,303
So that is definitely a serious problem 
and one that needs conversation and 

1741
01:18:46,341 --> 01:18:47,174
needs fixing.
What I'm referring to is stuff that's 

1742
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:52,760
more like we have 29 million people who 
are uninsured in this country.

1743
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:53,683
We have anywhere from 32 to 45,000
people that die every year in this 

1744
01:18:56,151 --> 01:18:58,160
country because they don't have access 
to basic healthcare.

1745
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,113
We pay a per capita,
we pay double what other developed 

1746
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:03,950
countries pay and again they cover 
everybody.

1747
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:06,260
We don't cover everybody,
so it's very.

1748
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,043
We're failing in every measurable way.
Even if you control for factors like 

1749
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:13,170
your accurately pointing out.
Yeah.

1750
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,480
I wonder what's going on too.
In terms of like,

1751
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:20,480
but we have a very high number of really
fantastic doctors.

1752
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:20,961
Well,
see,

1753
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:22,480
I know people.
That's how I'm gonna.

1754
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:23,810
Address that in a sense.
Please go.

1755
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:24,561
Okay.
So,

1756
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:26,780
um,
if you're a Saudi prince,

1757
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:27,973
you do want to come to the United States
for healthcare because if you're in the 

1758
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:31,460
top point,
oh one percent,

1759
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:32,960
you are going to get the best care here.

1760
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:34,053
It's just a brain surgeon or just as a 
pediatric surgeon for the average 

1761
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:38,324
person,
right?

1762
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,523
You're going to want to be in Canada or 
Sweden or Norway or Australia or any of 

1763
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:42,914
those places.
This is the argument for socialized 

1764
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:50,501
medicine versus privatized medicine that
privatized medicine incentivizes someone

1765
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:54,590
to excel.
Someone to be that guy that,

1766
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:56,450
hey,
this guy worked on Lebron James.

1767
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,680
Oh,
we've got to go see him.

1768
01:19:57,681 --> 01:19:59,390
So you know,
he's the best.

1769
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,180
That's a decent point.
And my counter to that is,

1770
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:03,014
and I know Bernie Sanders is as well 
because I've seen his bill and he 

1771
01:20:05,421 --> 01:20:07,800
advocates for a particular type of,
for all system.

1772
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:13,110
You don't need to ban supplemental 
private insurance.

1773
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,033
In fact,
I would totally disagree with any bill 

1774
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,093
that says we're now banning private 
insurance because you can do a single 

1775
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:21,084
payer system where you say,
we're going to have public funding of 

1776
01:20:23,521 --> 01:20:24,354
public institutions,
or you could do a single payer system 

1777
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,230
like the French do or the Canadian do,
where they were.

1778
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:32,310
The Canadians do,
where you have public funding of private

1779
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,790
entities,
so what you're talking about is,

1780
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,511
you know,
hey,

1781
01:20:36,511 --> 01:20:38,070
how are we going to.
If there's no competition,

1782
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:39,960
how are we going to get the best doctors
and things of that nature,

1783
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,003
and my reaction to that is I'm just 
talking about the baseline public 

1784
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:45,894
funding of private institutions and 
still allow people if they want to pay 

1785
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:50,400
extra and go to a specialist,
they could do that.

1786
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,293
I'm not necessarily even saying that.
What I'm saying is that the system of 

1787
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:59,790
having an incentive for being excellent.
Sure.

1788
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,450
Having a financial incentive that causes
people to excel.

1789
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:04,463
Yes,
I would agree with that in certain 

1790
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:06,810
fields,
not in other fields.

1791
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,673
Well,
I think it's certainly exist in the 

1792
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:13,731
medical field and in surgery,
in in many different medical practices.

1793
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:15,563
You find fantastic practitioners here in
the United States because they get paid 

1794
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:19,590
substantially for it.

1795
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:24,270
I would argue that the profit motive,
specifically in the realm of health care

1796
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,133
has had the opposite effect and has made
it so that we have a disastrous system 

1797
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,480
now.
If we talk about.

1798
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,980
I agree with you as well.
I agree with that as well,

1799
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,023
but I think that when you're saying that
they kick her ass and all these other 

1800
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:37,230
areas,
like if you say,

1801
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,333
I have Canadian friends that come over 
here to get operated on and I have and 

1802
01:21:41,221 --> 01:21:43,560
they have American friends who go to 
Canada to get healthcare,

1803
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,453
but it's cheaper.
That's why they're not going to be 

1804
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:47,573
right,
but they're not going how they get 

1805
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:49,763
Canada if you.
So if you were to go to Canada and you 

1806
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:52,734
were to get sick,
you just go to the hospital that they 

1807
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:55,730
don't charge you.
Even if you're an American citizen,

1808
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:56,310
if you're a citizen.

1809
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:59,040
In fact,
trump was saying back,

1810
01:21:59,041 --> 01:21:59,874
he was on like David Letterman show 
years before he became president and he 

1811
01:22:02,011 --> 01:22:02,844
was talking about how awesome the 
Scottish healthcare system is because 

1812
01:22:04,561 --> 01:22:08,130
his buddy went over there and he broke 
his arm when he was there and he went to

1813
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,560
a hospital in Scotland and on his way 
out,

1814
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:11,760
he's like,
how much do I owe you?

1815
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,050
And they said nothing.
Get Out.

1816
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:19,380
So if you're a guy in New Jersey and you
fly to Montreal because you're sick,

1817
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,830
they'll just take care of you.
Yeah.

1818
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,340
You don't have to be a Canadian citizen.
No,

1819
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:24,463
it's pretty amazing.
Don't tell people things just fucked up 

1820
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:28,500
because certain things,
listen,

1821
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:32,670
certain things in a civilized society 
should be off the table.

1822
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:34,290
It's just a matter of what are those 
things.

1823
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,350
It's not like everybody agrees with some
level of government.

1824
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:38,280
Everybody agrees,
okay,

1825
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:39,980
we should probably have,
you know,

1826
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,450
paved roads and police like that's a 
given.

1827
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,630
So it's just a matter of let's 
prioritize here.

1828
01:22:45,631 --> 01:22:46,464
What are the things that we're going to 
take off the table and fun with our tax 

1829
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:51,240
money and every other developed country 
has decided,

1830
01:22:51,241 --> 01:22:52,530
well,
healthcare is one of those things.

1831
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:53,430
Let's not be silly.
Yeah,

1832
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:54,264
we've talked about that many times in 
this podcast that socialism is 

1833
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:59,940
absolutely apparent in many aspects of 
our society,

1834
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,300
especially firefighters,
police officers.

1835
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:04,323
I mean paying for the street is paying 
the roads like we all agree that our 

1836
01:23:07,061 --> 01:23:10,960
money should be pooled to take care of 
these very specific issues,

1837
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:12,213
but then when it comes to some issues,
we get angry and we pretend socialism 

1838
01:23:14,651 --> 01:23:16,990
doesn't exist at all in this country.
Yeah,

1839
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:17,883
I think medicine is one of them,
but my problem with that is that 

1840
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:21,904
medicine is one of the most important 
things that a human being could ever 

1841
01:23:24,461 --> 01:23:29,461
have the in and if you get healthcare,
healthcare can allow you to stay alive.

1842
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:33,070
Like if you don't stay alive,
you can't contribute to the society.

1843
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:33,561
You're,
you're,

1844
01:23:33,561 --> 01:23:36,520
you're dying from something that they 
could cure.

1845
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:41,380
If you had the money to cure it.
Well this is a giant problem in society.

1846
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:44,920
If we don't address sick and ill people 
and injured people,

1847
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,810
that's true because then we're not 
caring for each other.

1848
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:47,703
Absolutely,
and a medical bills is one of the top 

1849
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:51,730
causes of bankruptcy in the United 
States.

1850
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:52,713
Can only imagine medical bankruptcy is 
just don't exist in the rest of the 

1851
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:56,650
modern world.
It's not a thing here.

1852
01:23:56,651 --> 01:23:57,484
It's a gigantic thing and a huge issue.
It's weird what we've done and you know 

1853
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:01,684
another thing that's weird,
it's what we've done with one of two 

1854
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:06,520
countries that allows pharmaceutical 
drug companies to advertise on the air,

1855
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:09,520
not just fucking insane congress,
and by the way,

1856
01:24:09,521 --> 01:24:12,340
this is why they have like a 15 or 20 
percent approval rating.

1857
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,350
They've repeatedly slapped down 
provisions that would give us cheaper,

1858
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:18,603
but pharmaceutical drugs because they're
allowing the pharmaceutical drug 

1859
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:21,940
companies to price gouge us.
Why?

1860
01:24:21,941 --> 01:24:23,590
Because they're all bought by big 
Pharma.

1861
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:26,140
Yeah,
that's.

1862
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,730
That's a giant issue,
right?

1863
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,160
What lobbyists?
Getting them out,

1864
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:32,410
special interest groups,
getting their influence out,

1865
01:24:32,411 --> 01:24:34,440
getting that kind of money and influence
out of pocket there.

1866
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:35,283
There's a way to do it.
Twenty eighth amendment money out of 

1867
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:38,374
politics.
You could do a system that's called 

1868
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:40,714
clean elections,
which is basically public financing of 

1869
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:43,324
elections where instead of instead of 
running and only having a bigger 

1870
01:24:46,241 --> 01:24:48,310
megaphone,
if you sell out more to billionaires,

1871
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:49,883
a,
you run and you actually have a battle 

1872
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:54,520
of ideas and competing philosophies,
and then whoever has the best ideas ends

1873
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:55,354
up winning.
So let's pretend let's go devil's 

1874
01:24:56,501 --> 01:24:59,020
advocate shirts.
Pretend you're arguing against that.

1875
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:03,640
What if you were some lobbyists for the 
pharmaceutical drug company and you were

1876
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:04,480
trying to make a.

1877
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:06,840
I'll tell you what they said.
Well,

1878
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,050
I'll tell you exactly what they say,
please.

1879
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:11,860
It's free speech is free speech to take 
a $20,000

1880
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,873
and give it to the Super Pac that's 
trying to get this politician elected 

1881
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,300
because you're telling me I can't do 
that.

1882
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,313
Then you're telling me that which means 
you're saying I don't have the free 

1883
01:25:19,091 --> 01:25:22,870
speech to be able to say I support a 
private pharmaceutical system.

1884
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:25,450
That's what they say.
They've literally argued that in court.

1885
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:26,680
That's hilarious.
Yeah,

1886
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:27,843
and then the counterargument to that is 
at many other people have pointed this 

1887
01:25:30,101 --> 01:25:30,881
out.
I'm not the first,

1888
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:31,714
but if money equals speech,
prostitution should be legal and murder 

1889
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:36,544
for hire should be legal because I'm not
actually hiring somebody to murder 

1890
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:40,024
somebody.
I'm just saying with speech because 

1891
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:43,240
money is speech that I'm okay with 
hitmen.

1892
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,380
Yeah.
Well,

1893
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:48,693
you know,
the real issue as well would be that 

1894
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:55,060
you're not talking about pharmaceutical 
companies making no money.

1895
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,080
There's still massive amounts of people 
that are on medication.

1896
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,063
They would still make a lot of fucking 
money that just wouldn't make as much 

1897
01:26:04,161 --> 01:26:06,320
money and how much money are they 
making?

1898
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:07,154
And that's where it gets obscene when 
you see the actual numbers of 

1899
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:09,914
pharmaceutical drug companies rake in,
in this country in terms of what it 

1900
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:15,140
takes to develop a drug versus what the 
profit margin is.

1901
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,550
It's fucking insane.
And the hurdles to get a drug,

1902
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,413
any drug.
And there is an issue that they're 

1903
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:22,394
dealing with right now with stem cells.
And stem cells have the approval of 

1904
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:25,190
that,
right?

1905
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:26,150
Yes.
Because they're,

1906
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:28,580
they're treating them like they are a 
drug.

1907
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:29,743
And the conspiracy theory is that 
pharmaceutical drug companies do not 

1908
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:38,330
want the approval of stem cells for 
therapy.

1909
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:39,261
Uh,
was there,

1910
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:41,070
whether it's a,
you know,

1911
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:42,243
umbilical,
all these different types of stem cells 

1912
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:48,910
because the success rate is fantastic 
and they think that it could potentially

1913
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:53,300
cut down a profit margins.
There are certainly an incentive problem

1914
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:54,134
there.
I mean just the same incentive against 

1915
01:26:55,281 --> 01:26:56,114
marijuana.
Marijuana sales would cut down on the 

1916
01:26:58,761 --> 01:27:00,560
sales of pharmaceutical drugs.
Yeah,

1917
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:03,170
absolutely.
And another really gross,

1918
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,093
a part of the system is that a lot of 
these drugs are actually created in our 

1919
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:10,910
universities by researchers and 
scientists.

1920
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,863
And then what happens is the,
for profit private Pharma companies 

1921
01:27:14,061 --> 01:27:14,894
swoop in,
they buy up the rights to it for very 

1922
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:17,864
cheap and then they price gouge and sell
it back to the American people for a 

1923
01:27:20,871 --> 01:27:21,704
huge profit when it was the taxpayers 
who funded the research in the first 

1924
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:25,064
place.
So it's a way where they screw you 

1925
01:27:26,331 --> 01:27:27,164
twice,
you have to pay for the creation of it 

1926
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:29,744
and the research of it.
And then they get the rights to it and 

1927
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:34,190
then they sell it back to you again and 
Jack up the price.

1928
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:36,530
And then it's even worse than that 
because there's this guy,

1929
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:38,960
Alex is our,
who's the head of the head of health and

1930
01:27:38,961 --> 01:27:42,230
human services now trump appointed him.
This guy worked for Eli.

1931
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:43,064
Lilly was a price Gouger,
jacked up the prices massively now as 

1932
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:49,820
the head of health and human services,
you know what he's in charge of lowering

1933
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:50,654
drug prices.

1934
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:56,270
So this is super transparent,
is hilarious.

1935
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:57,950
Well,
at the end of the brilliance of trump,

1936
01:27:57,951 --> 01:27:58,784
honestly,
the brilliance of trump is that he goes 

1937
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:03,770
out there and he says like he's populist
and his antiestablishment.

1938
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:05,900
But if you go issue for issue on his 
policies,

1939
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,830
he is massively pro establishment.
I mean the consumer financial protection

1940
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:10,664
bureau is the perfect example of this.
He picked a predatory payday lender to 

1941
01:28:13,761 --> 01:28:15,590
lead the consumer financial protection 
bureau.

1942
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,650
That bureau returned 11 or 
$12,000,000,000

1943
01:28:18,651 --> 01:28:21,470
to defrauded Americans when big 
financial institution screwed them.

1944
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:22,610
And now he's like,
yeah,

1945
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:23,444
let's make that worse.
Let's handcuff that agency and put a 

1946
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:28,790
predatory payday lender in charge of it.
So it's all.

1947
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:29,773
It's comical.
Yeah.

1948
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:32,360
It's comical like people wouldn't 
believe this to.

1949
01:28:32,361 --> 01:28:33,194
I follow this stuff on a daily basis.
I lose my damn mind when I read this 

1950
01:28:35,361 --> 01:28:36,194
stuff,
but think about your ability to follow 

1951
01:28:37,461 --> 01:28:38,210
this stuff.

1952
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:39,043
You have so much access to information,
you have so much time on your hands and 

1953
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:41,864
this is a main focal point,
whereas the average person is not going 

1954
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:47,270
to get this data and I don't blame them.
I'm not blaming.

1955
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,540
I'm.
I would never own a shame.

1956
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:50,810
Don't blame them.
They don't have.

1957
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,540
There's no.
There's no bandwidth because no way it's

1958
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:54,560
coming in.
Yeah.

1959
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:56,030
What you just said.
I mean,

1960
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:57,650
how many people know what you just said?
Not many,

1961
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:58,484
but that's my job.
My job is to come out here and to say 

1962
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:02,570
these things and everybody can check out
youtube.com,

1963
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,200
so secular talk,
shameless plug.

1964
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:05,063
I know a and Patrion.com.
So secular talking to other shameless 

1965
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:08,334
plug.
I know,

1966
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:09,533
but this is my job.
My job is to come out here and tell 

1967
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:14,160
people what I read and what I follow and
bottom line is guys,

1968
01:29:14,161 --> 01:29:16,170
and I don't want to come across as 
partisan in any way.

1969
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:17,520
Yes.
I like Bernie Sanders.

1970
01:29:17,521 --> 01:29:18,354
Yes,
I don't like Donald Trump or Hillary 

1971
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:20,063
Clinton,
but my whole thing is I want a system 

1972
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:23,183
that is based on common sense and it's 
rational and it's logical and it helps 

1973
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:29,130
people.
Now Bernie's not going to run.

1974
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,410
I think he might think so.
I think he might.

1975
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,210
I haven't heard a word about him.
Well,

1976
01:29:33,211 --> 01:29:35,460
he has been making some moves behind the
scenes.

1977
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:38,220
Anytime you see a solid station person 
representing him,

1978
01:29:38,221 --> 01:29:40,080
try to get ahold of us.
Oh really?

1979
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:41,310
Yeah.
They faked us out.

1980
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,810
There was a Bernie 20 slash 20 dot.
Oh my.

1981
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:47,430
The other sending the email,
so if you want to get to him,

1982
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,960
talk to me.
I don't know him,

1983
01:29:48,961 --> 01:29:52,470
but I know people who do know him.
I want to talk to him about his posture.

1984
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:56,280
Fix so many things about the way people 
perceive him.

1985
01:29:56,370 --> 01:30:01,370
We can move his head from the center of 
his chest and put it in a normal place.

1986
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:02,101
Well,
you know,

1987
01:30:02,101 --> 01:30:06,720
the funny thing about trump is posture.
This is how a person's supposed to be.

1988
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:08,660
They're not supposed to have been 
slashing two men.

1989
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,320
No,
you've been normal.

1990
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:14,610
Have Bernie's head is down here.
It's in the wrong spot.

1991
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:19,150
Those trends,
as you know,

1992
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:20,880
look at them.
Look where his head is.

1993
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:22,373
Look at up.
See if you find a picture of him right 

1994
01:30:24,031 --> 01:30:27,270
there.
His head is way lower than it's supposed

1995
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:29,430
to be.
Your head's supposed to be up here.

1996
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,220
See where my shoulders there.
Look at that picture of burning.

1997
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,860
Now Watch me.
I'm going to do the same.

1998
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,150
This is my.
This is.

1999
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:38,450
See,
where are my neck is sore my shoulders.

2000
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:39,323
Look at that.
It looks like he's doing a little dance 

2001
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:42,450
there.
Joseph doing with Jackie Mason.

2002
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:44,550
I call you a joke.
So when I'm trump or Bernie,

2003
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,210
that's what I do.

2004
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:49,710
You're not supposed to have your head so
far down on your chest right there.

2005
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:52,500
That's a perfect example.
Has terrible posture.

2006
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,513
You know I've said this about trump.
Everybody laughs at his orange face and 

2007
01:30:56,731 --> 01:30:59,670
is dyed blonde hair,
but I actually think that that does make

2008
01:30:59,671 --> 01:31:03,660
him look younger.
The orange face in the blonde hair,

2009
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:04,523
it probably does.
He gives him some sort of life because 

2010
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:07,470
if he didn't have,
let's say,

2011
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:09,830
let's say he didn't do the comb over,
he didn't die the hair,

2012
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:12,210
he didn't have the orange face.
People would be like,

2013
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:13,103
oh,
that's like a really senile old grandpa 

2014
01:31:15,271 --> 01:31:16,104
who was ranting.
There's been people who've done 

2015
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:21,030
photoshops and what he would look like 
without hair and with white,

2016
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:22,163
with white skin will.
Did you see that thing when he was 

2017
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:27,690
getting on Air Force One and it was like
he was a demon dude.

2018
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:29,640
Oh my.
But even there,

2019
01:31:29,641 --> 01:31:30,474
he's got some.
He's got and he's got the orange in his 

2020
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,060
face,
but see,

2021
01:31:33,061 --> 01:31:35,340
I would respect him if his hair looked 
like that.

2022
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,310
When I see him with his hair all fucking
swirled around.

2023
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,140
I'm like,
what are you doing?

2024
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,910
I'm going to defend trump now,
joe.

2025
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:45,140
That's what I'm going to do.
A lot of makeup.

2026
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:46,210
Just got a lot of makeup.
Dude.

2027
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:47,063
I'm stunned at the dedication he has to 
the comb over because this is probably 

2028
01:31:50,581 --> 01:31:54,300
like an hour long project every day and 
he does it every day.

2029
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:56,850
He's probably watching Fox and friends 
and tweeting.

2030
01:31:56,851 --> 01:31:58,090
As somebody who's doing.
Is there,

2031
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,253
do you think someone does it for them?
Is try to find the video of him walking 

2032
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:05,530
up the ramp to Air Force One.
Whereas hair,

2033
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,730
it looks like a demon.
Yeah,

2034
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:12,731
the skin suit on where it's like it just
pops off.

2035
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:14,680
He's pretending to be a human.

2036
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,513
He's rotting from the inside and he's 
just barely keeping it together because 

2037
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:21,910
that's one,
but it's the image that there's a direct

2038
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:22,744
behind angle.
That's the angle because you see how 

2039
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:26,230
there's just a giant bald spot back 
there.

2040
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:27,760
He does a really good job of covering 
it.

2041
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,750
He does.
It's just so crazy.

2042
01:32:29,751 --> 01:32:33,400
It's so much worse.
If you got trump hair gift,

2043
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,900
it might come up that way.
Go with.

2044
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,280
That's it right there,
Jamie.

2045
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,100
Here it is.
That's crazy.

2046
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:41,620
Now you could hear the horror movie 
noise as that happens.

2047
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:42,463
Like the weird thing is like look how.
Where's the hair coming from on the 

2048
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:46,594
sides?
Like how is there so much hair on the 

2049
01:32:48,431 --> 01:32:50,040
side?
It's a work of our jail.

2050
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:54,970
Like watch it goes up the stairs and 
wait for it.

2051
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:56,380
Oh,
there it is.

2052
01:32:56,381 --> 01:32:57,214
A wing that wing.
Has he not know that that wing is 

2053
01:33:00,131 --> 01:33:04,570
flopping around the amount of baldness 
in the back of his head.

2054
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:08,170
It's like he's growing hair only on the 
side of his head.

2055
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,570
Very strange.
Usually when people lose their hair,

2056
01:33:10,571 --> 01:33:15,220
that back portion still grows hair at 
the very back and his didn't streaming.

2057
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,590
I mean it looks demon.
Demon.

2058
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:18,583
So.

2059
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:20,933
So here he go.
Step by step on how to do a trump 

2060
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:26,620
haircut.
It looks like some fucking English.

2061
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,820
Okay.
I could've been.

2062
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:30,430
I could've been swayed into thinking 
going on there.

2063
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:32,490
Yeah.
But I actually do think that this,

2064
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,170
it does ultimately make them look 
younger.

2065
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,830
Helps.
I do.

2066
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:36,430
Yeah,
I do.

2067
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:38,410
With that picture of him balled up 
there.

2068
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,030
Scroll up there,
Jamie.

2069
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:42,280
That picture right there on that same 
row.

2070
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:45,550
The bottom rail.
The one next to it.

2071
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:46,360
Yeah.
Look at that.

2072
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,550
That's what he would look like.
Yeah,

2073
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:51,070
I looked fine there.
You think that looks fine?

2074
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,860
Yes.
I think he thinks he's not 70,

2075
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:56,980
but I think he looks like a pudgy uncle.
Fester then our chance.

2076
01:33:56,981 --> 01:33:59,560
He looks like a fucking man.
It doesn't give a shit about his hair.

2077
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:00,663
One of the things is a problem with him 
is it's not very manly to spend that 

2078
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:06,790
much time combing and spraying.

2079
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:07,623
That's true.
Especially for a billionaire in his 

2080
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:09,934
seventies.
It's one thing if you're like 20 and 

2081
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:13,270
you're panicking like,
holy shit,

2082
01:34:13,271 --> 01:34:15,280
I'm going ball before my time.
No,

2083
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:19,240
you're fucking 70 and you're worth what?
Twenty dollars,

2084
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,980
billion dollars or something.
Probably way more now.

2085
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:21,943
Yeah.
He's profited massively from being 

2086
01:34:23,261 --> 01:34:24,910
inside the White House.
There was some sort of.

2087
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:26,980
Oh,
we can talk about that because.

2088
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,680
So you know,
everybody focuses in mainstream media on

2089
01:34:29,681 --> 01:34:32,380
the Muller investigation and his ties to
Russia and stuff like that.

2090
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:33,483
I think everybody's missing the bigger 
story because the bigger stories that 

2091
01:34:36,011 --> 01:34:36,844
there are two different emoluments cases
which are proceeding against trump and 

2092
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:42,190
for those of you who don't know what 
that is in the constitution,

2093
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:44,980
there's the emoluments clause,
which basically says that a president of

2094
01:34:44,981 --> 01:34:45,814
the United States cannot take money from
foreign governments because there's a 

2095
01:34:49,361 --> 01:34:50,800
conflict of interest problem.
If you take.

2096
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:53,980
If I take money from whatever name the 
place,

2097
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,120
Russia,
Saudi Arabia,

2098
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:56,050
Israel,
you name it,

2099
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,980
if I do well,
then

2100
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,813
of course you're going to be 
incentivized to do policy in favor of 

2101
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:03,950
those countries and not necessarily 
what's best for the American people.

2102
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:04,993
And there are two court cases against 
trump that have proceeded in federal 

2103
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,650
court on this.
So while everybody's screaming about the

2104
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:10,484
Mueller investigation,
they're missing the even bigger 

2105
01:35:11,841 --> 01:35:12,674
corruption scandal.
I mean we were talking about Saudi 

2106
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:14,953
Arabia earlier,
the Saudi state of trump's hotel and 

2107
01:35:16,971 --> 01:35:19,700
paid 250,000
or $300,000

2108
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:21,200
and they didn't even fricking stay 
there.

2109
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,273
So why did they do that?
They did that because they're trying to 

2110
01:35:23,511 --> 01:35:26,090
make it so that when they give him a 
call and say,

2111
01:35:26,091 --> 01:35:27,600
hey man,
what about the $100,000,000,000

2112
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:29,930
weapons deal trumps like,
of course,

2113
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,750
because he's got more money in his bank 
account as a result of the Saudis.

2114
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,480
Similar thing happened with Israel on 
the way in.

2115
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:37,123
I'm jared cushner and some other people 
in the trump administration spoke to a 

2116
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:45,590
Israeli officials about how Obama and 
Kerry on their way out the door,

2117
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:47,600
we're going to say,
hey,

2118
01:35:47,601 --> 01:35:49,430
Israel stopped with the illegal 
settlements.

2119
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:52,400
It was just a little slap on the wrist.
It was more symbolic than anything else,

2120
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:54,980
but Israel was calling the trump 
administration and saying,

2121
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:55,873
we want you to try to kill this thing,
and of course jared Kushner has taken 

2122
01:35:59,361 --> 01:36:02,510
millions of dollars from Israeli banks 
and he has investments over there,

2123
01:36:02,511 --> 01:36:03,344
so there's.
You can't have a president of either 

2124
01:36:05,781 --> 01:36:06,614
party taking money from foreign 
governments because then they're going 

2125
01:36:09,441 --> 01:36:10,274
to do those governments bidding.
That's a huge problem and I don't see 

2126
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:13,604
anybody talking about that.
All I see them talking about is Mahler 

2127
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:16,250
and Oh my God,
Russia,

2128
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:17,084
Russia,
Russia,

2129
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,460
and it's been the only guy that's ever 
been president.

2130
01:36:19,461 --> 01:36:23,870
That really has been a substantial 
business to this extent for sure,

2131
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,750
or at least that I know of.
To be clear up.

2132
01:36:25,751 --> 01:36:28,600
Maybe there's a way before I knew.
Yeah,

2133
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,173
yeah.
It's,

2134
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:34,520
it's dark because everyone knows that 
this is an issue.

2135
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:35,600
I mean,
everyone knows,

2136
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:36,883
you know,
and that was one of the issues about 

2137
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:41,570
Russia is that he was trying to put 
hotels in Moscow.

2138
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:43,970
He did that with rush aided that with 
Taiwan.

2139
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:46,880
It's everywhere.
He pissed off China early on because,

2140
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:47,714
and this was maybe not as big of a deal,
but he took a phone call from the head 

2141
01:36:50,181 --> 01:36:53,570
of Taiwan and China does not want Taiwan
recognized as its own thing.

2142
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:57,140
And so that caused a huge diplomatic 
crisis because then China was like,

2143
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:58,360
what are you doing?
You can't,

2144
01:36:58,460 --> 01:36:59,293
don't talk to them as if they're their 
own independent thing and come to find 

2145
01:37:01,371 --> 01:37:04,280
out he was working on a deal to put a 
hotel in Taiwan.

2146
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:05,243
Yeah.
Well,

2147
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,200
what is the deal with China?
Taiwan versus China?

2148
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,780
It,
I don't know the detailed history that I

2149
01:37:11,781 --> 01:37:15,410
just know that China considers Taiwan.
There's and Taiwan says,

2150
01:37:15,411 --> 01:37:16,790
no,
we are our own thing.

2151
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:17,713
Right.
But that's one of those issues where 

2152
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:22,430
when Husana we on there because um,
I mean,

2153
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:24,470
I don't know enough about it to give you
my,

2154
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:25,573
to give you an opinion on it,
but it seems to me like China saying I 

2155
01:37:29,331 --> 01:37:31,010
want that to be ours and them saying,
no,

2156
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:31,844
that seems like a big deal.
Like it seems like you should even 

2157
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:34,840
endless.
Listen,

2158
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,673
I'm the type of person who says let's 
try to work it out in the US at however 

2159
01:37:38,691 --> 01:37:39,524
we can.
But if it really came to the point 

2160
01:37:40,551 --> 01:37:41,121
where,
I don't know,

2161
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:42,650
Texas was like,
seriously,

2162
01:37:42,651 --> 01:37:44,150
no,
we're leaving now because of reasons x,

2163
01:37:44,151 --> 01:37:46,070
Y and Z.
Should we have the right to tell them?

2164
01:37:46,071 --> 01:37:47,450
No.
I don't know.

2165
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:50,900
Well,
it was Taiwan was a part of China.

2166
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:51,530
Yeah,
I think so.

2167
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:52,940
Up until.
I don't know,

2168
01:37:52,941 --> 01:37:54,320
Dude.
I don't know.

2169
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,411
I try to.
Whatever.

2170
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,160
I don't know,
something.

2171
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,460
I try to be totally up front about it.
I appreciate that.

2172
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:01,830
That part of that story.
I remember thinking that this was,

2173
01:38:01,831 --> 01:38:03,660
you know,
people were saying this is unprecedented

2174
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:08,280
for the president of United States to 
talked to Taiwan when really China's got

2175
01:38:08,281 --> 01:38:09,114
a giant issue with this.
This could cause huge international 

2176
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:11,904
problems.
There was a big crisis behind the 

2177
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:15,090
scenes.
I didn't get it though.

2178
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:16,560
Well I didn't.
They was.

2179
01:38:16,561 --> 01:38:19,170
It was only a story for a day or two,
so I didn't know too many details of it.

2180
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:23,280
Have you been following at all the Ted 
Cruz versus Beta O'rourke race?

2181
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,293
No.
Would you say Ted Cruz should be voted 

2182
01:38:26,971 --> 01:38:30,990
out simply because he's Ted Cruz because
that's where I'm at with Ted Cruz.

2183
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:33,300
Well,
he's just a fool.

2184
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:35,050
He's just,
he's so smarmy.

2185
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,410
Call them smarmy Ted Cruz.
Well,

2186
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:40,650
one of my favorite parts of the election
was a.

2187
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:41,603
There was a guy with sunglasses on and 
he was at some sort of campaign rally 

2188
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,710
Ted Cruz,
and he was like,

2189
01:38:46,711 --> 01:38:47,480
it's over.

2190
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:48,750
Quit.
You're done.

2191
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:49,813
Oh,
this was during the presidential 

2192
01:38:50,071 --> 01:38:50,904
primary,
sir.

2193
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:51,743
What?
What?

2194
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,150
What is the issue that you have with me,
sir?

2195
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:55,560
And he's like,
it's over.

2196
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:56,394
You're a loser.
And it's like the guy who was a trump 

2197
01:38:57,871 --> 01:38:59,910
guy,
I was like wearing sunglasses.

2198
01:38:59,911 --> 01:39:01,500
Like the whole thing was just.
I was like,

2199
01:39:01,501 --> 01:39:03,150
you don't know how to handle trolls.
Like,

2200
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:06,630
look at you now.
He can't because he's such a fake gun.

2201
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:07,663
Show fake.
Did you ever see trump manhandle him in 

2202
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:13,110
the debate when he tried to bring up New
York values?

2203
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:15,150
I don't remember that.
Okay.

2204
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:16,103
It.
Is it cool if we watch that because 

2205
01:39:17,701 --> 01:39:18,534
you're going to have a favorite ted Cruz
things though was the excerpts of his 

2206
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:25,420
commercial when he was setting up those 
commercials and he had all the outtakes.

2207
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,470
Mom,
my mom prays for me for hours.

2208
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:30,323
She's like speaking the Fox business gop
debate Ted Cruz and Donald trump 

2209
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:36,230
discussed New York values.
Work values on.

2210
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:37,980
Say it again.
Play it,

2211
01:39:37,981 --> 01:39:38,814
play it again from the beginning.
Most people know exactly what New York 

2212
01:39:41,341 --> 01:39:42,174
values

2213
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:45,790
I am from New York.
You're from New York City.

2214
01:39:45,791 --> 01:39:46,624
You might not,

2215
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:51,920
but I promise you in South Carolina,
listen,

2216
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:54,750
there are many,
many

2217
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:55,763
wonderful,
wonderful working men and women in the 

2218
01:39:57,271 --> 01:40:02,271
state of New York,
but everyone understands that the values

2219
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:03,444
in New York City are socially liberal or
pro abortion are pro gay marriage focus 

2220
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:13,140
around money and the media and,
and I guess I can frame it another way.

2221
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,460
Not a lot of conservatives come out of 
Manhattan.

2222
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,313
I'm just saying

2223
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:26,730
conservatives actually do come out of 
Manhattan,

2224
01:40:26,731 --> 01:40:31,731
including William F Buckley and others.
Just so you understand this place.

2225
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,980
It's got great people.
It's kind of loving people,

2226
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:38,520
wonderful people.
When the World Trade Center came down,

2227
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:44,480
I saw something that no place on earth 
could have handled more beautifully,

2228
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:50,270
more humanely than New York to 110 story
buildings come crashing down.

2229
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:56,181
I saw them come down and we saw more 
death and even the smell of death.

2230
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:59,230
Nobody understood it and it was with us 
for months.

2231
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:00,363
The smell the air and we rebuild 
downtown Manhattan and everybody in the 

2232
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:10,030
world watched and everybody in the world
love New York and love New Yorkers and I

2233
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:10,864
have to tell you,
that was a very insulting statement 

2234
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:14,463
that,

2235
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:20,310
that could have been handled better.
You didn't like trump's response and was

2236
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,990
sloppy.
Just sucks,

2237
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:26,530
but he's just shitting on a whole state 
because he's a partisan hack prick.

2238
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:28,660
I understand that the way he handled it 
wasn't.

2239
01:41:28,661 --> 01:41:30,130
But I got to admit it was a good 
response.

2240
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:33,390
That ted such a cunt.
When I'm watching trump stand there.

2241
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:34,330
I'm like,
I hope you get some.

2242
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,130
Yeah.
Because he's so fake.

2243
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:36,993
Everything is so preplanned.
And the video you were talking about is 

2244
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:41,380
probably an even better example where 
he's,

2245
01:41:41,381 --> 01:41:42,214
you know,
pretending like he's sitting there with 

2246
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:44,320
his kids.
Like,

2247
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,880
all right.
Caden did eat your Broccoli.

2248
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:48,340
Well,
Bill Buckley's from England though.

2249
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:49,513
Um,
I guess he lived in Manhattan 

2250
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:51,250
afterwards.
I don't know.

2251
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:54,910
Did you ever see the Gore Vidal William 
F Buckley debates those?

2252
01:41:54,911 --> 01:41:57,250
Uh,
was it called the best of enemies?

2253
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,113
What was it called?
I thought it was on firing line his 

2254
01:41:59,141 --> 01:41:59,380
show.

2255
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:00,041
Maybe I could.
No,

2256
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:00,461
no,
no.

2257
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:03,070
There's a documentary about.
I didn't see that with a thing.

2258
01:42:03,071 --> 01:42:03,904
It's called the best of enemies,
but it's a about the 19 sixties debates 

2259
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,910
between buckling.
Is that best of enemies?

2260
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,290
It's great.
You should watch.

2261
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:15,320
I will check that out.
I'm like,

2262
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:17,680
I mean,
he pissed off Buckley to the point where

2263
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:20,650
Buckley called him a faggot and said,
uh,

2264
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:21,970
yeah.
He goes,

2265
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,800
Oh,
I forget what the way he said it.

2266
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:27,100
He goes,
I'll punch you and you'll stay plastered

2267
01:42:27,101 --> 01:42:29,140
or some fucking shit.
Sock it to the left.

2268
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:32,650
Yeah.
I forget the term that he used.

2269
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:35,410
You know,
Garba Dow lived in Ravello.

2270
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:40,470
He lived in Italy and you know,
he lived in la or Hollywood out of place

2271
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:42,560
in Ravello,
you know,

2272
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,010
and he,
you know,

2273
01:42:45,010 --> 01:42:46,130
I was up there.
I was,

2274
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:49,270
I was put it took a picture from 
instagram.

2275
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:50,830
This word,
Gore Vidal used to bank dudes,

2276
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:53,350
right?
Folks respect.

2277
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:56,100
I mean,
I'm a big fan of guava dog.

2278
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:57,370
He's a brilliant,
brilliant guy.

2279
01:42:57,790 --> 01:43:01,630
But I liked him.
He got under William F Buckley's skin so

2280
01:43:01,631 --> 01:43:04,210
bad that Buckley fell apart during the 
rebates.

2281
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:05,950
Oh,
you fucking screamed at him.

2282
01:43:05,951 --> 01:43:06,784
He's red in the face.
That's interesting because he was 

2283
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:12,430
calling him a Nazi.
Gore Vidal was calling me a Nazi.

2284
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:14,890
Yeah,
I saw 'em on Youtube.

2285
01:43:14,891 --> 01:43:18,910
They have William f Buckley versus Noam 
Chomsky and you've got the thing that he

2286
01:43:18,911 --> 01:43:20,770
said back in the sixties.
Oh,

2287
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:25,750
68 is fascinating to watch that because 
if you're really nerdy and wonky and you

2288
01:43:25,751 --> 01:43:26,584
love politics,
go watch William F dot Buckley versus 

2289
01:43:27,941 --> 01:43:30,490
Noam Chomsky because it is.
I love it.

2290
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:32,440
When I was a kid,
I used to watch it and be like,

2291
01:43:32,441 --> 01:43:33,520
Oh man,
this is amazing.

2292
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:36,700
He,
he calls the words you queer.

2293
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,080
No,
it was more than that,

2294
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:39,970
so I was trying to find the quote.
Yeah,

2295
01:43:39,971 --> 01:43:44,140
you could find the video.
He said he would punch him.

2296
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:48,130
Who is this on Netflix day plastered or 
something like that.

2297
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:52,670
He said more than the word queer.
Is this on Netflix?

2298
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:54,410
Yes.
Yes it is.

2299
01:43:54,411 --> 01:43:56,630
After you got to tell me the name may 
not be on Netflix.

2300
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:57,800
It's definitely on itunes.

2301
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:01,460
Yeah.
Maybe you call them a queer,

2302
01:44:01,461 --> 01:44:05,210
but whatever it was,
he called him a homosexual slur and then

2303
01:44:05,211 --> 01:44:06,044
he threatened to knock him out.
He threatened to sock him or whatever 

2304
01:44:09,561 --> 01:44:10,394
the fuck he thought,
but it was the red in the face and the 

2305
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:17,680
fucking eyeballs twitching and really 
was the end for William f Buckley and it

2306
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:20,060
was during an official like debate that 
they were having.

2307
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:22,820
It was during the series of debates at 
ABC put on.

2308
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:23,923
They put on a series of debates and Gore
Vidal was doing better and then William 

2309
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:29,750
f Buckley was kind of a cunt in Gore.
Vidal was mocking him.

2310
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:33,820
He very pompous polymath Buckley was 
gross.

2311
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:35,263
It's just weirdly grow,
but it showed how he fell apart from 

2312
01:44:37,941 --> 01:44:38,774
that statement on.
That was kind of the end of people 

2313
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:44,210
taking them completely seriously.
People now look back at him through rose

2314
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:46,310
colored glasses and they act like,
oh my God,

2315
01:44:46,311 --> 01:44:47,660
he's such a brilliant intellectual.

2316
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:49,670
Well,
sort of like what they do with Reagan.

2317
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:52,440
Reagan was an embarrassment.
Yeah,

2318
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:53,481
because they used to.
Well,

2319
01:44:53,481 --> 01:44:55,090
didn't he?
Late in his time in office,

2320
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:57,890
weren't there questions about whether or
not he had dementia?

2321
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:59,270
Oh,
100 percent.

2322
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:00,283
We'll.
Do you remember during the Iran Contra 

2323
01:45:01,401 --> 01:45:05,570
debates or the Iran contra trials where 
they asked him,

2324
01:45:05,571 --> 01:45:07,460
did you sell arms to Iran?
He's like,

2325
01:45:07,461 --> 01:45:08,810
I don't remember.
It kept saying,

2326
01:45:08,811 --> 01:45:09,644
I don't remember.
That could have been a tactic to try to 

2327
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:11,650
get out of it,
right?

2328
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:12,483
Oh,
he was.

2329
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:14,220
He was losing it if he didn't hear it 
as,

2330
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:16,483
oh,
this is even older than the Chompsky 

2331
01:45:16,961 --> 01:45:17,160
one.

2332
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:21,020
All right.
Here in the United States,

2333
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:22,063
I happen to believe that the United 
States policy is wrong in Vietnam and 

2334
01:45:25,321 --> 01:45:29,160
the Viet Cong are correct and wanting to
organize it in their own way.

2335
01:45:29,161 --> 01:45:29,994
Politically happens to be pretty much 
the western Europe and other parts of 

2336
01:45:33,901 --> 01:45:34,734
the world.
If it was a novelty in Chicago that is 

2337
01:45:36,841 --> 01:45:37,674
too bad,
but I assume that the point of the 

2338
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:43,930
American democracy got up a minute and 
the answer is that they will.

2339
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:47,753
They will well treated by people who was
precise them and I'm for ostracizing 

2340
01:45:51,271 --> 01:45:55,540
people who egg on other people to shoot 
American Marines and American soldiers.

2341
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:04,370
Crypto Nazi I can think of is yourself 
failing that I listened to you gentlemen

2342
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:20,190
his pornography and stop making any 
illusions of infantry in the last war.

2343
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:29,280
That started as a debate on Vietnam and 
then by the end they were.

2344
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:32,820
Now that's even seems like a big deal 
back then.

2345
01:46:32,821 --> 01:46:34,380
It was probably like,
oh my goodness.

2346
01:46:34,381 --> 01:46:37,800
I was probably on every a nightly news 
show you queer,

2347
01:46:37,801 --> 01:46:42,660
I'll suck you in their face and you'll 
stay plastered like that's almost like a

2348
01:46:42,661 --> 01:46:46,900
rapper dis suck you when you face in 
your steep plessy.

2349
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:49,580
Right?
Little bit,

2350
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:50,190
yeah,
a little

2351
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,260
bit,
but the documentary is fantastic.

2352
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:53,940
It looks good.
We should definitely go check that out.

2353
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:56,310
It's really good to give me the name 
when it's get out of here.

2354
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,233
It's the best of enemies.
It's really good because it just shows 

2355
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:00,804
you like the.
The time that they lived in it was just 

2356
01:47:03,661 --> 01:47:08,630
a different world and that ABC was so.
I mean,

2357
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:10,573
they were able to have this on national 
television and have debates on policies 

2358
01:47:15,151 --> 01:47:15,984
and on,
on politics between to recognize 

2359
01:47:17,791 --> 01:47:18,930
intellectuals,
one on the right,

2360
01:47:18,931 --> 01:47:19,764
one on the left,
and this is something that they did on 

2361
01:47:21,421 --> 01:47:23,310
national television.
It was a big success.

2362
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,560
You know,
for the longest time I was,

2363
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:26,903
I was very anti debate and still to an 
extent today I feel like I'm anti 

2364
01:47:29,311 --> 01:47:30,144
debate,
but the reason I am is because I feel 

2365
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:31,914
like it's a wwe of intellectual pursuits
where it's more of a show and it's more 

2366
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:37,980
about sophistry and it's more about 
being quick on your feet.

2367
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:41,250
Then who has the right arguments and I 
don't think that's good.

2368
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:43,200
But then the other argument is,
and now I'm,

2369
01:47:43,310 --> 01:47:44,143
I'm warming up to this argument,
is that it's such a better way to get 

2370
01:47:47,611 --> 01:47:50,210
people to watch and listen.
Because when,

2371
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:52,980
when you get really wonky and just have 
conversations with people,

2372
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:53,873
many people just kind of tune out to 
that because it doesn't keep their 

2373
01:47:55,441 --> 01:47:56,274
attention.
But what will keep their attention is a 

2374
01:47:57,541 --> 01:47:59,960
zinger.
So if you know how to deliver zingers in

2375
01:47:59,961 --> 01:48:02,790
into debate and you can get more people 
to watch and agree with you,

2376
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:05,160
then it's almost almost like a necessary
evil to do it.

2377
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:07,590
So I decided for the political thing.
I said,

2378
01:48:07,591 --> 01:48:08,424
okay,
you know what I will debate and I'll 

2379
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:12,390
debate mostly because my audience wants 
me to debate.

2380
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:14,670
I think my audience likes it.
They Tucker Carlson.

2381
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:14,991
No,
no,

2382
01:48:14,991 --> 01:48:15,411
no.
Jake.

2383
01:48:15,411 --> 01:48:16,680
You were debated,
Tucker Carlson,

2384
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:17,633
who you,
you're going to divide was going to 

2385
01:48:18,121 --> 01:48:21,090
debate and culture and culture pulled 
out.

2386
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,790
Okay.
And then she had the nerve to go on,

2387
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:25,820
good morning la and say,
you know,

2388
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:27,810
these liberals,
they chickened out of debating me.

2389
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:31,950
So she just blatantly lied.
She backed out of the debate with me and

2390
01:48:31,951 --> 01:48:34,710
then she goes on TV and says no.
And then she says her though,

2391
01:48:34,711 --> 01:48:36,120
isn't that what she,
she's a troll,

2392
01:48:36,121 --> 01:48:37,740
but here's the reasoning.
Here's her reasoning.

2393
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:40,080
It was so smug and so elitist.
She's like,

2394
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:42,750
oh,
how many best sellers does he have?

2395
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:45,090
Bitch,
I don't write books.

2396
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:51,620
I don't write books,
but I guarantee you write books like the

2397
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:52,563
book.
I guarantee you I had way more 

2398
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:56,460
listeners,
secular talk listeners there.

2399
01:48:56,461 --> 01:48:58,740
Then she had an culture fans and let me 
tell you something,

2400
01:48:58,770 --> 01:48:59,603
even I have people who are very 
conservative in my own family and when 

2401
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,680
they heard I was debating in culture,
you know what?

2402
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,450
Every single one of them said,
get that bitch.

2403
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:07,343
I don't like her.
And these are people who agree way more 

2404
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:10,890
with her than they do with me.
Well,

2405
01:49:10,891 --> 01:49:15,420
she's not really a Republican.
She's a troll and she's a heck yeah,

2406
01:49:15,421 --> 01:49:16,254
I don't,
I don't think she even believes what 

2407
01:49:17,161 --> 01:49:18,420
she's saying.
You know,

2408
01:49:18,421 --> 01:49:19,254
in one of the reasons why I say that is 
because the way Bill Maher treats or he 

2409
01:49:21,331 --> 01:49:23,680
laughs and jokes around with it's true.
Sure.

2410
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:26,490
He's like,
there's a wink and a nod with her.

2411
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:28,230
Exactly.
It's a hustle.

2412
01:49:28,231 --> 01:49:30,510
I think she's an entertainer.
I think that's true.

2413
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:32,460
And I remember back during the Bush 
years,

2414
01:49:32,461 --> 01:49:33,294
nobody was more in favor of the Iraq war
and thought it was the greatest thing 

2415
01:49:36,391 --> 01:49:37,680
ever and would,
you know,

2416
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:38,603
make fun of people who are against it.
And then when trump rose up through the 

2417
01:49:41,371 --> 01:49:44,730
republican ranks and he was bashing the 
Iraq war,

2418
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,650
which by the way,
I loved it when he did that.

2419
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:49,240
All the sudden she went on,
she hopped on the trump train.

2420
01:49:49,241 --> 01:49:50,860
When all the other candidates on the 
stage,

2421
01:49:50,861 --> 01:49:51,694
we're not bashing the Iraq war.
So she flipped on this major issue that 

2422
01:49:54,611 --> 01:49:57,220
defined five years of her so-called 
intellectual life.

2423
01:49:57,250 --> 01:49:59,080
It's not real.
It can't be real,

2424
01:49:59,160 --> 01:49:59,993
real.
She doesn't remember when she was 

2425
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:06,070
talking about invading Canada.
It's something about Canada's Canada not

2426
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:08,980
supporting us.
We'll fucking invade them over Iraq.

2427
01:50:08,981 --> 01:50:10,900
It was like it was something along those
lines.

2428
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,360
Vaguely remember what you're talking 
about.

2429
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:15,040
Something like this pitch out of her 
fucking mind when she said,

2430
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:15,874
we need to invade a one of these Muslim 
countries and just forcibly converted 

2431
01:50:19,061 --> 01:50:21,130
everybody there.
That was one of the things she said.

2432
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:23,050
I remember that.
It's a real man.

2433
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,880
These are the fact that she's still gets
considered for debates.

2434
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30,480
It's pretty stunning.
I know she's.

2435
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:32,230
She's just disingenuous.
So it would've been.

2436
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:33,880
I would've been screaming at,
you know,

2437
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:36,090
a wall basically.
But the person I knew would have,

2438
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:40,480
it would have been wonderful seeing 
everybody says that the corral that lady

2439
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:42,850
into taking the stage with you,
it'd be fantastic.

2440
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:46,000
Can Run circles around her.
I ended up debating Scottie Nell Hughes,

2441
01:50:46,001 --> 01:50:46,834
who was big on TV during the 2016 
election and she was a trump backer and 

2442
01:50:49,481 --> 01:50:50,314
now she's on our.
And actually she ended up being very 

2443
01:50:52,151 --> 01:50:52,690
reasonable.

2444
01:50:52,690 --> 01:50:53,523
I'd say we actually ended up agreeing on
maybe 65 percent of the issues and we 

2445
01:50:55,961 --> 01:50:57,760
had some pr,
some strong disagreements,

2446
01:50:57,761 --> 01:51:00,880
but mostly agreeing and I think it was a
very fruitful conversation.

2447
01:51:00,881 --> 01:51:01,714
But I don't know if the audience liked 
it as much as they would've liked me 

2448
01:51:03,311 --> 01:51:04,430
bashing culture said,
oh,

2449
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:05,890
the audience probably would've liked it 
more.

2450
01:51:05,891 --> 01:51:09,070
But it's nice when those kinds of 
conversations where people do agree on a

2451
01:51:09,071 --> 01:51:09,904
lot of issues,
even regardless of what side they're 

2452
01:51:11,921 --> 01:51:14,950
supposedly on do take place because it 
makes people.

2453
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:18,250
It gives people hope and the idea of 
reasonable discourse.

2454
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:23,020
So then you would have absolutely loved.
I was on a panel with Charlie Kirk,

2455
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,120
have turning point USA and he's,
you know,

2456
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:27,070
close with candice son.
He's 12 years old.

2457
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:28,830
He's young.
He's not really,

2458
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:29,950
he's probably,
he's my dean.

2459
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:30,971
No,
no,

2460
01:51:30,971 --> 01:51:32,200
no.
You're thinking of a different person.

2461
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:33,610
He's a little kid.
You're joking.

2462
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:36,400
I see.
As fairly in your face.

2463
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:37,710
I'm very,
I'm a very literal dude.

2464
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,160
So sometimes stuff goes right over my 
head,

2465
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:41,013
but we were on hand as they sold girl 
scout cookies together that I would 

2466
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:44,780
actually believe her.
They did.

2467
01:51:45,630 --> 01:51:47,440
Um,
so I was on a panel called,

2468
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:48,274
how are we going to get along?
Charlie Kirk was one of the panelists 

2469
01:51:50,111 --> 01:51:51,250
now going into it,
I thought,

2470
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:54,430
I'm not going to agree with this dude on
absolutely anything.

2471
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:55,653
But when we got in there,
what I did is I tried to frame issues 

2472
01:51:59,141 --> 01:52:03,850
from what his ideology is.
So he says he's a conservative.

2473
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:04,961
So I said,
okay,

2474
01:52:04,961 --> 01:52:07,450
that means typically you believe in 
smaller government.

2475
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:08,531
So I said,
okay,

2476
01:52:08,531 --> 01:52:10,390
here's some areas where I believe in 
smaller government,

2477
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:11,253
I think we need to stop the warrantless 
NSA spying or we're collecting 

2478
01:52:13,331 --> 01:52:16,240
everybody's information without their 
approval.

2479
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:17,900
And without a warrant,
um,

2480
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:19,960
I think that we need to stop the drug 
war.

2481
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:21,820
I think we need to,
uh,

2482
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:23,613
you know,
and our invasions of other countries 

2483
01:52:25,721 --> 01:52:26,554
because that takes a big government and 
billions of dollars to do these 

2484
01:52:28,061 --> 01:52:30,400
invasions and rebuild countries and 
things of that nature.

2485
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:32,670
And I even said on the death penalty,
um,

2486
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:35,380
we should probably stop that because 
about six percent of the time we get the

2487
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:37,570
wrong people and probably shouldn't be 
the case.

2488
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,640
And on virtually every one of these 
issues.

2489
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:40,863
Charlie Kirk agreed with me.
He even agreed with me on the issue of 

2490
01:52:42,971 --> 01:52:44,700
Saudi Arabia where,
you know,

2491
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:46,370
I said it,
they

2492
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:47,240
said something like,
oh,

2493
01:52:47,241 --> 01:52:49,700
we like law and order and the law and 
order president is Donald Trump.

2494
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:50,900
I said,
if you really like law and order,

2495
01:52:50,901 --> 01:52:53,750
you'd be against the trump 
administration arming $110,000,000,000

2496
01:52:53,751 --> 01:52:56,110
worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.
And Charlie Kirk,

2497
01:52:56,111 --> 01:52:57,350
to his credit goes,
no,

2498
01:52:57,351 --> 01:52:58,280
I,
I agree with that.

2499
01:52:58,610 --> 01:53:01,100
Now the other guy on the panel was an 
absolute pack.

2500
01:53:01,101 --> 01:53:03,410
He's a Milo Wannabe.
I don't know his actual,

2501
01:53:03,411 --> 01:53:05,750
I don't even know his name,
but he,

2502
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,600
it was clear he was doing an act and 
he's a daily wire,

2503
01:53:08,601 --> 01:53:10,580
third stringer,
like he's Ben Shapiro's thing,

2504
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:13,370
but he's a low level guy and his,
I swear,

2505
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,263
I swear to you joe,
he was talking about how I'm very pro 

2506
01:53:16,551 --> 01:53:17,384
life and I need you to know that I'm 
very pro life and this is something I 

2507
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:21,260
support.
My response to him was,

2508
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,150
well,
I'm glad to know that you're against the

2509
01:53:23,151 --> 01:53:25,970
death penalty and immediately without 
skipping a beat,

2510
01:53:25,971 --> 01:53:26,804
he goes,
I'm for the death penalty and the 

2511
01:53:30,561 --> 01:53:32,270
audience laughs and I go,
well,

2512
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:34,150
if you're going to walk right into my 
trap every time,

2513
01:53:34,151 --> 01:53:35,930
it's going to be very easy debate now,
isn't it?

2514
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,590
What's going on with Milo?
When was the last I,

2515
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:42,530
I should be asking you that.
I didn't even know the dude.

2516
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:44,330
I haven't heard a peep out of him.
And no,

2517
01:53:44,331 --> 01:53:44,781
he,
uh,

2518
01:53:44,781 --> 01:53:45,614
I think his whole thing imploded because
there was an article that came out and 

2519
01:53:47,901 --> 01:53:50,600
they have like correspondence between 
him and literal,

2520
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:51,860
like actual.
All right.

2521
01:53:51,861 --> 01:53:53,990
People were,
they were just kind of doing puff pieces

2522
01:53:53,991 --> 01:53:54,824
for them.
That was my understanding of it and he 

2523
01:53:56,271 --> 01:53:58,590
kind of disappeared after that and 
temporarily he was,

2524
01:53:58,610 --> 01:54:01,070
he was with Alex Jones.
You did a few shows with Alex Jones.

2525
01:54:01,071 --> 01:54:03,220
I was the last I saw of puff pieces 
like,

2526
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:04,183
yeah,
like trying to make it seem like they 

2527
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:06,314
aren't what they actually are.
Like he was partying with Richard 

2528
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:10,160
Spencer and they were singing together 
and it was weird.

2529
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:13,520
Yeah,
he's a weird character.

2530
01:54:15,730 --> 01:54:16,563
He's a,
he's definitely a weird character but I 

2531
01:54:18,771 --> 01:54:22,940
actually enjoyed talking with him off 
the air and I felt like there's a lot of

2532
01:54:22,941 --> 01:54:24,950
what he is.
That's the tricks.

2533
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:26,240
Sure.
And you know,

2534
01:54:26,241 --> 01:54:27,074
it's hard to tell.
It's hard to tell because it's hard to 

2535
01:54:29,481 --> 01:54:30,314
tell like how much of how much of what 
you think is theatrical is them being 

2536
01:54:34,251 --> 01:54:35,084
theatrical when the aunt,
they're on air and how much is 

2537
01:54:36,771 --> 01:54:41,771
theatrical when they're talking to you 
and trying to be endearing off here?

2538
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:46,610
Yeah.
It is hard to tell,

2539
01:54:46,611 --> 01:54:47,444
but sometimes you can see it when there 
are people who kind of get involved in 

2540
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:52,124
this political space is awesome and 
really all they want to do is just 

2541
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:58,490
become famous and it's like,
that shouldn't be the point.

2542
01:54:58,491 --> 01:55:00,710
You should really get in on this 
political thing because you actually are

2543
01:55:00,711 --> 01:55:01,880
really interested in politics.

2544
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,590
I mean,
that's really what it comes down to.

2545
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:04,700
Wood.
That's you.

2546
01:55:05,010 --> 01:55:06,050
Yeah,
because I'm a nerd.

2547
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:08,250
That's why I didn't expect my thing to 
ever get the.

2548
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:09,470
Honestly,
when I first started,

2549
01:55:09,471 --> 01:55:14,360
I really thought maybe in my wildest 
dreams I'll get to 100,000

2550
01:55:14,361 --> 01:55:17,150
subscribers on youtube and as I talked 
to you right now,

2551
01:55:17,151 --> 01:55:21,440
we're almost about to cross 600,000.
So I never expected any of this.

2552
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:24,230
I never expected any of this.
And the fact that it happened.

2553
01:55:24,231 --> 01:55:25,400
Um,
I'm just grateful for it.

2554
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:28,310
While you're an intelligent guy with 
very reasonable points,

2555
01:55:28,311 --> 01:55:30,470
so you deserve all the credit that 
you've gotten,

2556
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:31,633
but you are also honest like you,
these are your actual opinions and this 

2557
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:37,094
is your actual perspective.
The real problem with someone like Ann 

2558
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:40,663
Coulter or someone like many of these 
other people that I see out there that 

2559
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:43,860
we don't have to name

2560
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:46,820
is that they're hustlers.
They found an end.

2561
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:51,540
There's an in for a certain type of 
conservative person.

2562
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:54,850
There's an end for a certain type of 
democratic persons and in for.

2563
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:57,180
I mean I.
There's pro women,

2564
01:55:57,181 --> 01:55:58,920
people that don't give a fuck about 
women.

2565
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:00,570
They're bullshit artist.
Absolutely.

2566
01:56:00,990 --> 01:56:01,823
Absolutely.
We're supposed feminists when they're 

2567
01:56:02,971 --> 01:56:05,400
just narcissists.
There's a lot of that out there.

2568
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:10,200
There's men's rights activists.
They really only care about finding this

2569
01:56:10,201 --> 01:56:13,950
way into a group of people where if you 
have their support,

2570
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:18,450
there's just a large conglomeration of 
them and you can sort of take them in as

2571
01:56:18,451 --> 01:56:19,740
your fans.
Do you feel.

2572
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:21,690
Do you feel like that died down a little
bit?

2573
01:56:21,691 --> 01:56:23,430
The men's rights activist thing?
Yeah.

2574
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:24,323
I feel like there were maybe three years
ago it was very big and then now it's 

2575
01:56:26,121 --> 01:56:29,370
kind of it about it.
That shit from them,

2576
01:56:29,371 --> 01:56:29,730
right.

2577
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:33,890
Then they would ship,
you know,

2578
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:36,000
having them be upset at me.
I don't give a fuck,

2579
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:39,390
but my bit was that every men's rights 
activists I ever met,

2580
01:56:39,391 --> 01:56:40,710
I just want to grab and go,
dude,

2581
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:43,890
we got them all.
Shut the fuck up.

2582
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:46,300
We run everything.
Almost everything.

2583
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,393
The whole idea is that.
Not that I don't think men should have 

2584
01:56:48,691 --> 01:56:50,550
rights,
but it's just we've got them.

2585
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:54,960
Yeah,
and that my thing in the bit was what if

2586
01:56:54,961 --> 01:56:55,794
women start to pay attention to the 
things men actually did when they 

2587
01:56:57,541 --> 01:56:57,991
started going,
hey,

2588
01:56:57,991 --> 01:57:00,090
we just realized you guys caused all the
war,

2589
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:01,223
every single war ever,
and it's like if you met women caused 

2590
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:04,643
all the war would be like,
well we got to kill these fucking crazy 

2591
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,640
bitches.
The want to do is go to war.

2592
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:10,560
This was in your most recent special,
right?

2593
01:57:10,561 --> 01:57:11,550
Yeah.
That's great.

2594
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:14,670
And it was thought out there was some of
them were upset at me,

2595
01:57:14,671 --> 01:57:16,710
but like that's a pretty bulletproof 
argument.

2596
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:17,723
Like the only men's rights.
Our argument that's legitimate is 

2597
01:57:21,421 --> 01:57:23,070
divorce laws.
Sure,

2598
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:24,020
I agree with that.
And we're in,

2599
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:24,913
we're in when it comes to alimony and 
when it comes to child support and when 

2600
01:57:28,621 --> 01:57:30,720
it comes to child custody.
Yeah,

2601
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,273
totally agree with that.
There are men Nigga fucked over and I 

2602
01:57:34,141 --> 01:57:34,974
know guys that have gotten fucked over 
in that regard and you know what courts 

2603
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:40,523
tend to side towards the mother and even
if the most deceptive and if the mother 

2604
01:57:44,281 --> 01:57:45,114
is,
you know,

2605
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:46,043
they'll say something like he beats the 
kids or I think he might've done 

2606
01:57:48,871 --> 01:57:49,704
something sexual to the kids.
There's women have done horrible things 

2607
01:57:52,531 --> 01:57:53,364
like that and they've done that to get 
more money or they've gotten done that 

2608
01:57:56,191 --> 01:57:57,120
to get custody of.

2609
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:00,210
They'd done that just for spite.
But this is just.

2610
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:01,093
This is a matter of the courts being 
designed to work the situation system 

2611
01:58:05,641 --> 01:58:06,474
being designed to protect kids and 
protect the mother who needs to get 

2612
01:58:09,571 --> 01:58:10,404
money to be able to take care of the 
children because there's a lot of 

2613
01:58:12,061 --> 01:58:13,930
fucking shitty deadbeat dads.
Now,

2614
01:58:13,931 --> 01:58:17,460
if there were no dead beat dads,
if men always paid child support,

2615
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:18,863
then this would be far less of an issue.
The issue is the reason why women can 

2616
01:58:22,441 --> 01:58:25,080
exploit it is because so many men were 
pieces of shit.

2617
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,080
Sure.
It.

2618
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:31,080
It created this need for some sort of 
some sort of law that set some something

2619
01:58:34,081 --> 01:58:37,040
that's set to protect children and to 
protect women with.

2620
01:58:37,070 --> 01:58:39,270
With that get custody.
Yeah,

2621
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:42,490
and now it looks like the.
With the divorce issue and everything,

2622
01:58:42,491 --> 01:58:43,324
the pendulum swung a little too far in 
the other direction and there's this 

2623
01:58:45,491 --> 01:58:49,210
default setting which is actually not 
too good for the guy.

2624
01:58:49,650 --> 01:58:50,483
The guy you're talking about too,
because I saw that podcast a long time 

2625
01:58:52,631 --> 01:58:53,464
ago.
I think it was one of the people you 

2626
01:58:53,681 --> 01:58:56,350
work with on news radio or something 
that's just one of them.

2627
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:59,290
That's just one of them.
I know many people that have been fucked

2628
01:58:59,291 --> 01:59:02,350
over by by divorce.
Then you know,

2629
01:59:02,351 --> 01:59:03,184
and look,
I have a good friend of mine who I've 

2630
01:59:04,811 --> 01:59:09,040
talked about them on the podcast before.
He has been divorced for 14 years.

2631
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:12,910
He has been married to a new woman for 
12 years.

2632
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:18,040
He still pays alimony.
Not only does he still pay alimony,

2633
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:18,874
he pays alimony to tone of more than a 
hundred thousand dollars a year to a 

2634
01:59:22,091 --> 01:59:24,490
woman that he doesn't have sex with.
So he can't retire.

2635
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,370
He cannot retire.
This woman has a boyfriend.

2636
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:29,380
She lives in his house,
old house,

2637
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:31,680
my friend's old house.
She owns the house.

2638
01:59:31,770 --> 01:59:32,603
They don't have any children.
This is the idea that he fucked her so 

2639
01:59:35,651 --> 01:59:36,940
hard.
She can't work again.

2640
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:41,320
Like she's not 80 years old man.
I mean she's now in her fifties.

2641
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:46,330
That's almost like indentured servitude.
It's fucking insane to give me $100,000

2642
01:59:46,331 --> 01:59:47,570
a year.
He's giving.

2643
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:49,420
Well,
it's tapered down to like,

2644
01:59:49,421 --> 01:59:52,000
I think it's now at $150,000
a year,

2645
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:53,043
but at one point he was paying a quarter
million dollars a year and he's paid or 

2646
01:59:56,261 --> 01:59:59,230
that for 12 fucking or 14 fucking years 
now.

2647
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:02,740
Fourteen years.
He's been married to a woman for 12.

2648
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:03,693
He has a family.
He has a family and asked to send money 

2649
02:00:05,651 --> 02:00:07,780
to this lady.
He doesn't talk to anymore.

2650
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:10,060
Like she can't move on with their life 
and if he doesn't,

2651
02:00:10,061 --> 02:00:11,710
he gets locked up.
If he doesn't,

2652
02:00:11,711 --> 02:00:12,940
he goes to jail.
Yeah,

2653
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:13,893
I mean this is.
And he's trying to go to court and she 

2654
02:00:15,251 --> 02:00:19,330
fights it and she lives with her 
boyfriend and when they send people over

2655
02:00:19,331 --> 02:00:21,820
to check the boyfriend puts his stuff in
a fucking u haul,

2656
02:00:21,821 --> 02:00:24,490
drives around the block weights and then
comes back.

2657
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:25,510
So what if,
let's say,

2658
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:29,800
let's say he loses his job and he can't 
find another job for whatever reason.

2659
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:32,380
He's lucky.
He just always the money no matter what.

2660
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:35,250
And there's no like you can't go back in
front of a court and they can read,

2661
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:35,900
uh,
you know,

2662
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:37,990
take it down or whatever.
That's a good question.

2663
02:00:37,991 --> 02:00:40,870
I mean that you'd have to go to court 
and a judge would have to agree,

2664
02:00:40,871 --> 02:00:41,704
but he's a successful man.
That's part of the problem is he's not 

2665
02:00:44,351 --> 02:00:46,920
going to be a loser.
He's an ambitious guy,

2666
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:49,180
does really well.
He works very hard.

2667
02:00:49,181 --> 02:00:52,870
He works 10,
12 hours every day and he has for ever.

2668
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:55,240
And He's good.
He's smart.

2669
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:58,420
He's good at his job.
And because of this,

2670
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:01,650
he has to pay this woman that he doesn't
fuck anymore forever.

2671
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:03,130
That's crazy,
man.

2672
02:01:03,131 --> 02:01:04,840
It's a nightmare.
It's a nightmare.

2673
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:07,030
But here's the thing.
It's like she's not,

2674
02:01:07,570 --> 02:01:11,680
she's not like,
she's not in a hospital bed.

2675
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,980
It's not like she can't work.
It's like she's,

2676
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,113
she's totally capable of making a living
and she now has probably four or five 

2677
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:21,094
plastic surgery.
She is the person we were talking about 

2678
02:01:22,121 --> 02:01:24,550
earlier.
I don't even know me.

2679
02:01:24,551 --> 02:01:26,530
Maybe she went,
she fits the route.

2680
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,420
Maybe she went the opposite.
I don't know.

2681
02:01:28,421 --> 02:01:32,630
But the idea that my friend has to pay 
her and every now and then you know,

2682
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:33,280
we'll,
we'll,

2683
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,270
we'll talk about it.
I'm like,

2684
02:01:34,271 --> 02:01:35,680
you still have to pay her.
And she'll just go,

2685
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:38,570
oh my goodness.
He's fucking.

2686
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:40,160
I mean,
got a family.

2687
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:41,143
He's got a wife and he has children with
this new woman and he's happy and he 

2688
02:01:45,341 --> 02:01:49,190
still has to pay.
What does that $2,000

2689
02:01:49,191 --> 02:01:50,024
a week,
2000 plus a just an absolute nightmare 

2690
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:56,590
areas.
So here's a check for $2,000.

2691
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:58,670
Lady.
I don't even know anymore.

2692
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:01,790
So speed.
I guess this is somewhat related to what

2693
02:02:01,791 --> 02:02:02,624
we're talking about here,
but what did you make of the cabinet 

2694
02:02:04,030 --> 02:02:05,890
thing?
Um,

2695
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:08,030
this is my,
I mean,

2696
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:08,913
I've,
I've spent a lot of time over the last 

2697
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,410
week paying attention to it.
Oh really?

2698
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:15,230
This happened to a little longer.
You just caught up on it,

2699
02:02:15,231 --> 02:02:17,900
you're saying for awhile it was like,
this guy is gross.

2700
02:02:17,901 --> 02:02:19,070
This is gross.
I don't want.

2701
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:22,490
When the main thing was happening,
we just weren't paying attention to it,

2702
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:23,743
but over the last week of paid a lot of 
attention to it and here's my take on 

2703
02:02:27,201 --> 02:02:27,580
it.

2704
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:28,750
Um,
one of,

2705
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:33,470
one of the things that got me was um,
well,

2706
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:36,860
one of the things that got me is it 
seems like most of his,

2707
02:02:37,790 --> 02:02:42,020
most of his life and his young life,
that guy was fucked up.

2708
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:44,390
He was drinking a lot.
Did you see,

2709
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:45,480
read the yearbook?
Did you see the year?

2710
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:46,300
Yeah,
yeah,

2711
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,133
yeah.
And all the stuff about like on the 

2712
02:02:49,581 --> 02:02:50,414
calendar,
like he had his calendar and then when 

2713
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:56,840
things were scheduled,
beers were scheduled.

2714
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,550
Very bizarre.
That's very busy.

2715
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:01,850
And he was so like frat boy,
Douchey,

2716
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:03,800
like all this stuff he said was very 
cliquey.

2717
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:05,540
Yeah.
And he also lied.

2718
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:07,220
Oh,
endlessly.

2719
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:08,140
Yeah.
Dashawn.

2720
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:11,870
That alone is all I need to know.
He said,

2721
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:15,500
he said goofing is farting and goofing 
of course means fucking.

2722
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:16,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

2723
02:03:16,010 --> 02:03:19,370
Everybody knows that that's nonsense.
So He's a liar.

2724
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:20,413
So,
and then he perjured himself and saying 

2725
02:03:21,891 --> 02:03:23,100
that he didn't know.

2726
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:23,993
And by the way,
the Democrats didn't even mention 

2727
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,210
perjury.
They just,

2728
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:29,000
they just kinda laid down.
They just kinda laid down.

2729
02:03:29,001 --> 02:03:32,060
My whole thing was,
I think it was a gross spectacle.

2730
02:03:32,061 --> 02:03:32,720
And I,
I,

2731
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:33,553
I honestly,
I thought that even the hearings 

2732
02:03:34,551 --> 02:03:35,384
happening,
I felt like it was a little bit of a 

2733
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:37,874
clown show because it's like,
here we are the most powerful 

2734
02:03:39,981 --> 02:03:42,080
organization in the most powerful body.
This government,

2735
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:42,914
United States government where we're 
having this hearing and we're talking 

2736
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:46,310
about drinking.
That happened in the 19 eighties.

2737
02:03:46,610 --> 02:03:50,030
It just struck me as so silly.
But at the same time,

2738
02:03:50,031 --> 02:03:52,310
the thing that you know,
I was screaming about,

2739
02:03:52,311 --> 02:03:53,144
and I might may have literally been the 
only person in the country screaming 

2740
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:56,173
about this stuff.
I actually went through cavenaugh as a 

2741
02:03:58,310 --> 02:03:59,143
judicial record with a fine tooth comb 
and I disagree with him on basically 

2742
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,040
every decision he's ever made.

2743
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:06,830
And that's not an exaggeration.
He's for warrantless NSA spying.

2744
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,650
He rules with corporations 87 percent of
the time.

2745
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:12,740
He said that all of Obamacare is 
unconstitutional.

2746
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:15,830
He ruled that the EPA can not regulate 
greenhouse gas emissions.

2747
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:17,023
Uh,
he even goes as far as to say Donald 

2748
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:20,750
Trump might be able to pardon himself.
So.

2749
02:04:20,751 --> 02:04:21,441
And that's,
I mean,

2750
02:04:21,441 --> 02:04:22,274
that's like,
that was one of the reasons why they 

2751
02:04:23,211 --> 02:04:25,040
think that Donald Trump was getting him 
in the first place.

2752
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,890
But that's the thing.
But that's also part of the Patriot Act.

2753
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:28,611
Yes.
Yes.

2754
02:04:28,611 --> 02:04:31,790
That's like the end of modern 
civilization type shit because you can't

2755
02:04:31,791 --> 02:04:34,310
have somebody above rule of law that's 
like a dictator for.

2756
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:36,680
That's craziness.
So the thing that drove me crazy,

2757
02:04:36,681 --> 02:04:37,980
Joe,
is that here you have

2758
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,843
on all those important issues.
Did you hear a single democratic 

2759
02:04:42,241 --> 02:04:44,520
politician bring that up in the 
conversations,

2760
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,860
but it wasn't at all about the 
accusations.

2761
02:04:46,861 --> 02:04:47,694
It was all about the act.
I'm not saying you can't bring up the 

2762
02:04:49,381 --> 02:04:51,480
accusations at all.
I think you can bring it up,

2763
02:04:51,481 --> 02:04:52,314
especially because some of them seem to 
have decent amount of evidence on their 

2764
02:04:54,841 --> 02:04:55,674
side and seemed very measured and 
reasonable in their comments so you can 

2765
02:04:57,421 --> 02:04:59,220
bring it up,
but it just annoyed me that there wasn't

2766
02:04:59,221 --> 02:05:03,780
like a two pronged strategy and trying 
to defeat it because the Democrats suck.

2767
02:05:03,781 --> 02:05:05,910
Joe.
They suck because it just to suck.

2768
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:09,180
They suck in the end.
They don't think there's any pressure to

2769
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:11,160
not bring up those issues?
No.

2770
02:05:11,161 --> 02:05:12,060
Well,
maybe.

2771
02:05:12,061 --> 02:05:13,860
I guess maybe a little bit,
but Chuck Schumer,

2772
02:05:13,861 --> 02:05:14,694
for example,
cut a deal with Donald Trump just 

2773
02:05:15,751 --> 02:05:18,960
recently and he let them approve like,
I forget the exact number.

2774
02:05:18,961 --> 02:05:21,240
You guys can fact check me on this.
Six or 10 different.

2775
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:22,213
A Jew of trump's judges,
he cut a deal to approve them so the 

2776
02:05:26,251 --> 02:05:29,250
Democrats can go back home and campaign 
for the upcoming election,

2777
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:30,091
but it's like,
hey,

2778
02:05:30,091 --> 02:05:30,924
douche bag.
The reason why you guys are struggling 

2779
02:05:33,271 --> 02:05:35,460
in elections is because you don't stand 
for anything,

2780
02:05:35,461 --> 02:05:36,294
so those people,
why don't you to fight on those judges 

2781
02:05:37,441 --> 02:05:38,274
because you're not supposed to agree 
with those judges because that's the 

2782
02:05:39,751 --> 02:05:40,890
Goddamn opposition party.

2783
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:42,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

2784
02:05:42,291 --> 02:05:43,124
I don't understand why they wouldn't 
bring up all those issues that you 

2785
02:05:45,081 --> 02:05:46,800
talked about before.
Here's 15.

2786
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,210
See I even formations of 15 trump 
judges.

2787
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:51,073
Look.

2788
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:54,783
Yeah,
and see this is my problem with them is 

2789
02:05:56,031 --> 02:05:56,864
that you could give them an issue like 
take legalizing marijuana that in 

2790
02:05:59,231 --> 02:06:03,990
exchange dems facing reelection can go 
home to campaign.

2791
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:06,950
How ridiculous.
And this is what the Democrats do,

2792
02:06:06,951 --> 02:06:07,784
Joe,
is that like we were talking earlier 

2793
02:06:08,661 --> 02:06:09,494
about marijuana.
Sixty two percent of the country now 

2794
02:06:11,151 --> 02:06:11,984
wants legal marijuana.
The only democratic politicians talking 

2795
02:06:14,031 --> 02:06:16,520
about it is Bernie Sanders and maybe a 
handful of others.

2796
02:06:16,610 --> 02:06:19,670
And if they ran on these issues,
and I can name a thousand others,

2797
02:06:19,671 --> 02:06:21,010
like raising the minimum wage,
uh,

2798
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:23,000
ending the wars.
If they run those issues,

2799
02:06:23,001 --> 02:06:24,080
they'd win,
but they just don't do it.

2800
02:06:24,270 --> 02:06:25,320
Yeah.
Well,

2801
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:26,213
I agree with you.
The cavanaughs take on all those issues 

2802
02:06:28,201 --> 02:06:29,580
are pretty fucking vile.
Yeah,

2803
02:06:29,650 --> 02:06:33,900
but it did.
All those things disturb me.

2804
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:38,630
What disturbed me most about what they 
were talking about in terms of his youth

2805
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:41,310
wasn't that he did bad things in his 
youth.

2806
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:44,020
It's that he's lying about them now.
Yeah,

2807
02:06:44,021 --> 02:06:44,550
yeah,
yeah.

2808
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:45,930
If he said,
look,

2809
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:48,390
when I was 17 years old,
I was stupid,

2810
02:06:48,391 --> 02:06:52,170
like many 17 year olds and I drank,
but I never raped anybody.

2811
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:53,263
Did stupid things and maybe I acted 
insensitively and maybe I said some 

2812
02:06:56,371 --> 02:06:58,350
things that I shouldn't have said 
because I was a fool.

2813
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,393
I am not a fool anymore.
And now I'm a judge and now I think it 

2814
02:07:02,521 --> 02:07:05,430
would make a great supreme court justice
if he could say that,

2815
02:07:05,431 --> 02:07:06,264
but he didn't.
He got angry and like same like I've 

2816
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:10,680
watched the video of him saying,

2817
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:13,240
I'd like beer.
You like it.

2818
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:14,880
He's asking a senator,
do you like it?

2819
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:16,140
Do you like it?
I like it.

2820
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:18,210
Like,
what does that fucking mean?

2821
02:07:18,211 --> 02:07:21,510
You're talking about you as a teenager 
when it's illegal to drink you stupid.

2822
02:07:21,511 --> 02:07:22,344
Fuck.
And he also did a little slight of hand 

2823
02:07:23,251 --> 02:07:24,600
there and said,
oh,

2824
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:27,450
most of the seniors at the time could 
legally drink.

2825
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,250
Yeah.
Why'd you say most of the seniors?

2826
02:07:29,251 --> 02:07:30,084
We're not talking about.
Most of the seniors were talking about 

2827
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:31,854
you.
He wasn't legally allowed to drink at 

2828
02:07:32,791 --> 02:07:33,990
the time,
but you're right,

2829
02:07:33,991 --> 02:07:36,040
you're exactly.
The problem

2830
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,113
was the lies.
He could've just said exactly what you 

2831
02:07:39,041 --> 02:07:40,210
laid out there,
but he didn't do it.

2832
02:07:40,211 --> 02:07:41,044
Which again speaks to his credibility 
and it's kind of funny that the one 

2833
02:07:43,511 --> 02:07:45,790
woman,
if he did do that to her,

2834
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,810
the one woman who turns out to be a 
professor,

2835
02:07:49,811 --> 02:07:54,811
it's hugely progressive,
super liberal university who it's almost

2836
02:07:55,901 --> 02:07:58,780
predominantly women.
Like if you looked at how many women are

2837
02:07:58,781 --> 02:08:00,820
professors at the university and how 
many women's.

2838
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,630
I think it's something like 79 percent 
of the women are 70.

2839
02:08:04,631 --> 02:08:07,150
Nine percent of the students are women 
at the university.

2840
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:11,020
And in some large number of the 
professors are women as well.

2841
02:08:11,110 --> 02:08:11,890
Yeah.
Well,

2842
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:14,730
well at least one of the allegations 
were bullshit against him.

2843
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:16,550
You know who it was,
right.

2844
02:08:16,570 --> 02:08:17,403
Michael have a naughty.
That anti-trump grifter who just wants 

2845
02:08:19,301 --> 02:08:21,280
to get his fucking name in the media,
he,

2846
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:25,870
he represented some woman and there's 
thousand holes in her story,

2847
02:08:26,110 --> 02:08:26,943
but this asshole,
because he wants to get his name in the 

2848
02:08:28,121 --> 02:08:29,230
spotlight,
he,

2849
02:08:29,270 --> 02:08:30,103
he adds on to the other accusations and 
some of the other exhibitions do have 

2850
02:08:33,221 --> 02:08:34,010
merit any.

2851
02:08:34,010 --> 02:08:34,843
He blows up the whole thing,
so now the Republicans can turn around 

2852
02:08:35,951 --> 02:08:37,810
and go,
look what we got here.

2853
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:39,580
Bullshit example.
So it's all bullshit.

2854
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:41,350
I think he did it.
Now Sharpton.

2855
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,600
That guy is a scumbag.
And by the way,

2856
02:08:43,601 --> 02:08:47,440
he was just a political one where I was 
and he's listened.

2857
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:48,333
He came out of nowhere.
He came out of nowhere and now he's 

2858
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:53,830
talking about running for president.
Who the fuck are you?

2859
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:57,280
I saw someone say that they think you'd 
be great.

2860
02:08:57,310 --> 02:08:58,143
Yeah.
Well they say,

2861
02:08:58,290 --> 02:08:59,710
whoever said,
that's a fucking idiot.

2862
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,600
It was bill Maher.
Well,

2863
02:09:01,601 --> 02:09:02,650
Bill Maher,
can I,

2864
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:05,830
you know,
I used to like him,

2865
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:07,840
but he's gotten progressively worse and 
worse.

2866
02:09:08,290 --> 02:09:10,060
No Pun intended,
on using the word progressive.

2867
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:13,660
I think it was him on Sam Harris,
his show.

2868
02:09:13,661 --> 02:09:16,260
I'm thinking about it now.
I think it was him talking about his.

2869
02:09:16,261 --> 02:09:17,350
His argument was,
oh,

2870
02:09:17,351 --> 02:09:19,100
because I want a Democrat with balls and
have an naughty.

2871
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:19,901
Has Balls.
Yeah,

2872
02:09:19,901 --> 02:09:23,020
but the problem is he's a piece of Shit 
grifter I'm talking about.

2873
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,330
He was gonna make a presidential run.
Apparently on extra.

2874
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:26,383
They just posted this and why is the 
fucking mainstream media allowing this 

2875
02:09:29,531 --> 02:09:30,490
guy?
They're letting.

2876
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:31,910
They're giving them free airtime,
Joe.

2877
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:33,400
Well,
this is the problem with the media.

2878
02:09:33,460 --> 02:09:35,440
Why aren't you giving serious people 
free air time?

2879
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:36,363
Why aren't you giving fucking economists
or professors who are experts in social 

2880
02:09:39,341 --> 02:09:41,790
policy give people who know something,
some airtime.

2881
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:44,170
This guy's obviously a grifter.
Well,

2882
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:47,590
they're giving him free air time because
people are going to pay attention to the

2883
02:09:47,591 --> 02:09:48,424
idea that he's going to run for 
president because he was representing 

2884
02:09:50,321 --> 02:09:51,154
stormy Daniels and stormy Daniels.
Fuck the president and this whole big 

2885
02:09:55,091 --> 02:10:00,091
fucking clown car circus event is.
It's something that people tune into.

2886
02:10:00,770 --> 02:10:03,280
It's basically an episode of keeping up 
with the Kardashians,

2887
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:06,100
the presidential issue,
and imagine that's your guy.

2888
02:10:06,101 --> 02:10:06,700
Like,
Hey,

2889
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:07,690
who are you?
Oh,

2890
02:10:07,691 --> 02:10:10,660
I got famous because I represented 
stormy Daniels,

2891
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:12,201
like,
oh,

2892
02:10:12,201 --> 02:10:13,780
what a fucking genius.
You are.

2893
02:10:13,781 --> 02:10:15,160
Good Gal.
And she,

2894
02:10:15,161 --> 02:10:15,994
uh,
she,

2895
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:18,280
she fucked a guy and she wants some 
money.

2896
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:20,493
The fact that that's like stormy Daniels
has been in the news more than the 

2897
02:10:23,711 --> 02:10:24,544
genocide in Yemen,
which our weapons are being used to 

2898
02:10:28,661 --> 02:10:31,420
carry it out with.
I saw a fucked up meme.

2899
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:34,130
It's,
it's stormy Daniels is now going back

2900
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,460
to porn because trump makes America work
again.

2901
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:40,880
That's actually true by the way.
She's good.

2902
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:42,430
She's going to strip clubs and stuff.
Well,

2903
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:44,510
I know she's been going to a strip club.
She got arrested.

2904
02:10:44,511 --> 02:10:45,620
That was fucked up.
She got,

2905
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:46,483
there were these police officers who 
were super pro trump and they went to 

2906
02:10:48,431 --> 02:10:49,264
one or a strip club events and they just
arrested her piece that she did 

2907
02:10:53,061 --> 02:10:56,270
something that was upstairs bullshit.
And I'm no stormy Daniels Fan,

2908
02:10:56,271 --> 02:10:58,220
but you don't use that.
So that was a political arrest.

2909
02:10:58,221 --> 02:11:02,900
It was just a fucked up thing.
The whole thing is so gross.

2910
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:03,763
You know what?
I went down in the rabbit hole on 

2911
02:11:04,851 --> 02:11:07,730
recently.
Mgk versus m and M.

2912
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:10,190
Have you seen this?
What was mgk and.

2913
02:11:10,191 --> 02:11:12,500
Okay.
I was in the exact same boat as you like

2914
02:11:12,501 --> 02:11:14,060
three weeks ago.
Okay.

2915
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:16,670
Jamie's all excited about black twitter 
now.

2916
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,553
Okay.
So,

2917
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:20,860
so m and M,
everybody knows legendary rapper,

2918
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:23,360
one of the best rappers of all time 
broadly considered that.

2919
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:24,563
Um,
he did an album where I guess he 

2920
02:11:25,071 --> 02:11:25,904
mentioned mgk because mgk who's another 
rapper years ago had tweeted something 

2921
02:11:29,451 --> 02:11:31,670
about his gun caching gun Kelly.
Oh,

2922
02:11:31,671 --> 02:11:33,290
what are you mgk in me,
Bro?

2923
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:35,120
I thought was mgk.
I don't know,

2924
02:11:35,121 --> 02:11:37,190
I'm not trying to be cool.
I thought that his fucking name was.

2925
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:39,000
I did see that.
Yeah.

2926
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:40,160
So,
uh,

2927
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:42,740
did you see the rap videos where they 
went back into a terrible.

2928
02:11:42,741 --> 02:11:44,350
Both of them.
Both sides killed them.

2929
02:11:44,351 --> 02:11:48,220
So I got sucked into a vortex where I 
was watching all the commentary on it.

2930
02:11:48,310 --> 02:11:49,101
No,
it was,

2931
02:11:49,101 --> 02:11:49,934
but I,
I was fascinated by people's take us 

2932
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:52,700
takes on it.
When people were saying,

2933
02:11:52,701 --> 02:11:54,110
Oh man,
murdered him.

2934
02:11:54,111 --> 02:11:55,070
And I listened to it,
I was like,

2935
02:11:55,071 --> 02:11:56,240
this is terrible.

2936
02:11:56,530 --> 02:11:57,850
Well,
with Tara was killed,

2937
02:11:57,851 --> 02:11:59,430
shot terrible,
or was wrapped.

2938
02:11:59,470 --> 02:12:00,970
Devil terrible.
They both suck.

2939
02:12:01,050 --> 02:12:03,230
Rose.
He's not a rap guy,

2940
02:12:03,231 --> 02:12:06,160
so this doesn't.
I do like and I'm only marginally a guys

2941
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:07,180
like Redo.
Okay.

2942
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:10,430
Yes I do.
I listen to a lot of reps that just felt

2943
02:12:10,431 --> 02:12:14,000
like it was just.
I actually liked the mgk song though.

2944
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:15,380
Like the beat.
Okay.

2945
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,480
It was a good beat.
Congratulations.

2946
02:12:18,350 --> 02:12:20,640
But he like ruined his career as a 
result of this.

2947
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:22,550
No,
that's what I look at.

2948
02:12:22,551 --> 02:12:25,430
The light that this like on Youtube,
it's like fucking 50 percent dislike.

2949
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:27,040
Why do you pay attention to that?
I,

2950
02:12:27,110 --> 02:12:29,390
that's why I told you I got sucked into 
a vortex of it.

2951
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,253
You can't pay attention to that.
That's not representative of whether or 

2952
02:12:32,121 --> 02:12:34,720
not the guy has a career.
I bet it boosted his plot.

2953
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:38,450
I mean that was the argument people said
maybe he did it because even though he's

2954
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:40,160
this photo is sort of what ended it.

2955
02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:44,630
He posted this thing like I when sort of
with this large crowd behind them,

2956
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:48,380
but he didn't tell them that he was 
opening his opening for fall out boy.

2957
02:12:48,381 --> 02:12:50,580
And this is followup boys crowd.
Yeah.

2958
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:52,860
He told them he took off his jacket.
At the last second,

2959
02:12:52,870 --> 02:12:55,760
so everyone turned around for a picture 
and then he got booted after this by the

2960
02:12:55,761 --> 02:12:57,620
entire crowd.
Did he know he got booed?

2961
02:12:57,650 --> 02:13:00,110
There's a video of it.
But did they actually,

2962
02:13:01,150 --> 02:13:04,130
one of the bullying videos was fake.
I do remember that.

2963
02:13:04,131 --> 02:13:06,950
I don't know if it was this one,
but I do know that he had a Hoodie on or

2964
02:13:06,951 --> 02:13:08,780
something and he took it off before this
picture.

2965
02:13:08,781 --> 02:13:10,820
So they didn't know that you had that 
shirt on,

2966
02:13:10,821 --> 02:13:13,030
which is the cover of m and m's album.
And you're right,

2967
02:13:13,031 --> 02:13:16,910
it was fallout boys crab,
which is kind of a weird weasely move of

2968
02:13:16,911 --> 02:13:17,744
this guy to do.

2969
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:20,313
I'm sleeping.
Joe's Joe doesn't care about the rap 

2970
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:23,130
game.
Wants to.

2971
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:25,010
Not that I don't care about the rap 
game.

2972
02:13:25,011 --> 02:13:29,540
It's this fucking.
These distracts are so lazy that he took

2973
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:31,290
the distracts,
get me interested again.

2974
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:32,453
That's what it took to get me interested
because I remember back when was fifty 

2975
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:35,790
cent versus jd kiss and I fucking loved 
it.

2976
02:13:35,810 --> 02:13:38,640
But when I was a kid,
I fucking love that.

2977
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:40,600
The J dot Rapp was one of the best.
Uh,

2978
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:42,540
I thought it was the best battle rap 
I've ever heard.

2979
02:13:42,710 --> 02:13:44,350
Well,
what about Jay z versus non?

2980
02:13:44,351 --> 02:13:46,530
So that's a classic,
that's a classic.

2981
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,540
And that did nothing but help both of 
them.

2982
02:13:48,541 --> 02:13:51,940
Right?
A kid help nas more than help.

2983
02:13:51,941 --> 02:13:54,300
Jay Z dot I think.
No,

2984
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:56,840
no,
you think Jay z versus not has helped.

2985
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:58,800
Jay Z,
black twitter.

2986
02:13:58,860 --> 02:14:02,150
Look at it as an expert over there.
He loves it.

2987
02:14:02,330 --> 02:14:03,163
He gets crazy.
He'll come back and tell you who's 

2988
02:14:04,051 --> 02:14:04,884
dating,
who they run the twitter and all the 

2989
02:14:07,231 --> 02:14:10,890
memes of oil comes from.
They run twitter.

2990
02:14:10,910 --> 02:14:11,743
One 25 percent of twitter memes and 
everything is coming out of black 

2991
02:14:14,161 --> 02:14:15,660
twitter.
Twenty five percent.

2992
02:14:15,661 --> 02:14:18,240
Did you do the math?
It's a known fact,

2993
02:14:18,241 --> 02:14:18,900
Bro.
I'm like,

2994
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:20,970
Bro,
I didn't pull it out of my ass.

2995
02:14:21,090 --> 02:14:22,070
Okay.
Um,

2996
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:24,570
speaking of social media,
have you seen all these purges recently?

2997
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:26,730
There's a new round of it that just 
happened.

2998
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:27,960
No Way.
A purge,

2999
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:28,823
800 or 800 or more accounts were purged 
from facebook and twitter and they're 

3000
02:14:34,201 --> 02:14:36,930
all,
almost all alternative media accounts.

3001
02:14:37,110 --> 02:14:40,170
So some of the sites are snowflakes.
Was One,

3002
02:14:40,171 --> 02:14:44,130
I think on facebook there's another one 
called anti media that was purged there,

3003
02:14:44,131 --> 02:14:47,040
an antiwar media thing,
free thought project is another one.

3004
02:14:47,170 --> 02:14:49,980
Take this and there was cop watch,
police.

3005
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:53,780
The police was called.
So basically what they're saying is it's

3006
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,140
such a bullshit argument.
They said,

3007
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:56,003
oh,
the reason we pulled this is because 

3008
02:14:57,091 --> 02:14:57,924
it's inauthentic behavior.
We're pulling these accounts because 

3009
02:15:00,961 --> 02:15:03,000
there's inauthentic behavior on those 
accounts.

3010
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:04,020
What does that mean?
I don't know.

3011
02:15:04,290 --> 02:15:05,730
That's the point.
And they never clarified.

3012
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:07,590
So what I think it means is,
hey,

3013
02:15:07,591 --> 02:15:08,850
these are,
you know,

3014
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:13,260
these are alternative media outlets and 
we want to get rid of them so we're just

3015
02:15:13,261 --> 02:15:14,094
gonna get rid of them because facebook,
I know met with the Israeli government 

3016
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:18,030
and Israel told them,
hey listen,

3017
02:15:18,031 --> 02:15:18,864
if you're gonna be in our country,
you're going to get rid of certain 

3018
02:15:20,701 --> 02:15:22,620
accounts and facebook when right along 
and said,

3019
02:15:22,621 --> 02:15:24,570
sure,
we'll do that with China,

3020
02:15:24,571 --> 02:15:25,430
with Google.
Right.

3021
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,540
But now I think they're doing that in 
the US now.

3022
02:15:27,541 --> 02:15:28,740
I think there,
yes.

3023
02:15:28,741 --> 02:15:29,574
I think they're working in cahoots with 
the US government and so you have all 

3024
02:15:31,591 --> 02:15:34,410
these alternative media counselor,
specifically antiwar.

3025
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:35,243
What have you.
Anticorruption some of these are okay 

3026
02:15:36,470 --> 02:15:37,650
and they're getting purged?
No.

3027
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:38,723
The argument was inauthentic behavior.
That was one of the reasons they cited 

3028
02:15:42,301 --> 02:15:44,250
as to why they got rid of this 
inauthentic behavior.

3029
02:15:44,251 --> 02:15:45,084
Does that mean that they're talking 
about instances that they're 

3030
02:15:47,611 --> 02:15:49,320
misrepresenting?
No,

3031
02:15:49,321 --> 02:15:52,000
I think it means more like bots.
That's how I interpreted it.

3032
02:15:52,001 --> 02:15:53,010
It's like,
oh,

3033
02:15:53,011 --> 02:15:56,040
you know you're posting it and you're 
directing people to your own,

3034
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:59,850
you know stuff and everybody does that 
on facebook and twitter.

3035
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:03,930
Is it possible that that's what was 
going on?

3036
02:16:03,931 --> 02:16:06,120
I don't know.
I'm just asking is it possible they were

3037
02:16:06,121 --> 02:16:11,121
using bots and perhaps directing them 
towards revenue creating sites or.

3038
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:12,583
My.
My whole thing is why shouldn't that be 

3039
02:16:13,621 --> 02:16:14,620
allowed?
Well,

3040
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:15,930
I'm not saying they shouldn't be 
allowed,

3041
02:16:15,931 --> 02:16:16,764
but is it possible that they were using 
stories that were taking place in the 

3042
02:16:20,551 --> 02:16:21,384
news,
distorting those stories to get people 

3043
02:16:22,681 --> 02:16:23,514
to click on things that would have links
to ways that these people can make 

3044
02:16:27,211 --> 02:16:28,044
money,
so instead of it being some sort of 

3045
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:30,130
political

3046
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:30,963
activism website that really was just a 
revenue generating bullshit site that 

3047
02:16:35,891 --> 02:16:39,760
was trying to drum up artificial 
outrage,

3048
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:40,683
is that possible?
I think for some of them it's certainly 

3049
02:16:41,561 --> 02:16:42,690
possible,
but certainly not.

3050
02:16:43,310 --> 02:16:45,130
Certainly not for the free thought 
project.

3051
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:47,380
What is it free thought project?
It's another one of these,

3052
02:16:47,381 --> 02:16:48,214
I think they described themselves as 
like an antiestablishment or anti 

3053
02:16:50,171 --> 02:16:51,650
corruption,
you know,

3054
02:16:51,890 --> 02:16:54,430
thing where they cover all these stories
related to government corruption,

3055
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:56,980
kind of like a wiki leaks type thing,
except they don't do the Wiki leaks,

3056
02:16:56,981 --> 02:16:57,814
does more of the original reporting 
stuff and they'll just cover it after 

3057
02:16:59,921 --> 02:17:02,800
the fact.
And how many facebook deleted them?

3058
02:17:02,890 --> 02:17:04,190
Facebook,
I think I read it in,

3059
02:17:04,430 --> 02:17:05,263
if,
I think there was an article in the 

3060
02:17:06,101 --> 02:17:06,761
Guardian,
Jamie,

3061
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:08,790
if you're interested in pulling it up,
it's um,

3062
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:13,810
facebook and twitter purge 100 sites.
So when you mix it was like,

3063
02:17:13,811 --> 02:17:14,644
I think it was mostly on facebook,
like 600 or so on facebook and the 200 

3064
02:17:17,381 --> 02:17:18,214
or so on twitter that they did and a lot
of them were like one of the accounts 

3065
02:17:20,971 --> 02:17:24,160
that over 3 million people who liked it.

3066
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:26,380
Now,
the free thought project,

3067
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:29,200
what has their response been to this?
I don't know.

3068
02:17:29,410 --> 02:17:30,910
I don't because I only saw the original 
article.

3069
02:17:30,911 --> 02:17:32,710
I haven't seen anything after it,
you know,

3070
02:17:32,711 --> 02:17:35,020
this is a discussion that I was having 
with red the other day.

3071
02:17:35,050 --> 02:17:38,140
We were talking here it is.
First they came for Alex Jones.

3072
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:40,660
We told you you are next.
We're,

3073
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:41,980
oh,
we were next.

3074
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,550
We were.
This is on their website,

3075
02:17:46,150 --> 02:17:48,640
but they did cover it in the Guardian 
and some other outlets in case anybody's

3076
02:17:48,641 --> 02:17:51,340
thinking that this is bs.
Yeah.

3077
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:53,023
That's so good.
It is a scary time because you see that 

3078
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:55,940
this can impact,
you know,

3079
02:17:56,590 --> 02:17:58,660
really anybody who's not toeing the 
line,

3080
02:17:58,661 --> 02:18:00,010
if you will,
like a police,

3081
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:01,810
the police.
Are we really gonna like,

3082
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:03,820
do we really think that they pulled that
down?

3083
02:18:04,030 --> 02:18:04,863
Not for the obvious reason,
which is that you're sowing discord and 

3084
02:18:07,451 --> 02:18:09,460
the police don't like it as part of its 
purge.

3085
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:10,293
Facebook has removed the pages of 
several police accountability watch dog 

3086
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,720
critic groups,
including Copblock,

3087
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:17,920
the free thought project and police the 
police.

3088
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:20,350
They've also apparently severely 
restricted.

3089
02:18:20,351 --> 02:18:23,890
The activity for the photography is not 
a crime page.

3090
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:25,873
Huh?
So you think they're getting pressure 

3091
02:18:28,511 --> 02:18:30,400
from law enforcement?
I don't.

3092
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:31,293
I don't know,
but I never usually believe in a smoke 

3093
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:34,863
filled backroom conspiracies,
but they're starting to get hard to 

3094
02:18:36,821 --> 02:18:38,890
avoid because there's so many of these 
things.

3095
02:18:38,891 --> 02:18:40,100
When,
um,

3096
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:42,220
scroll down please.
Here's what we need.

3097
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:43,113
Look at this and how does this poem,
and again says first they came for Alex 

3098
02:18:47,230 --> 02:18:48,850
Jones and info wars,
but I wasn't race baiting,

3099
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:50,710
transfer spirits.
He cultivated Clemson,

3100
02:18:50,711 --> 02:18:51,730
murdered children,
new town.

3101
02:18:51,731 --> 02:18:52,564
Where are hoaxes and admitted in court 
that I'm just an entertainer who makes 

3102
02:18:55,731 --> 02:18:57,070
shit up,
so I said nothing.

3103
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,300
Yeah,
they're just trying to be flippant about

3104
02:18:58,301 --> 02:18:59,380
how Alex Jones was pulled.

3105
02:18:59,410 --> 02:19:03,520
The problem was once you bought into the
principle of Alex Jones being polled,

3106
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:04,593
well then what you're saying is people 
who are executives at these companies 

3107
02:19:08,171 --> 02:19:10,690
can willy nilly decide whoever they want
to pull down.

3108
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:13,840
Now my answer to that has always been we
should take twitter,

3109
02:19:13,841 --> 02:19:15,790
facebook,
these giant social media pages.

3110
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:16,713
They can still be private companies,
but we should regulate them like their 

3111
02:19:19,181 --> 02:19:20,380
public utilities.
You know?

3112
02:19:20,381 --> 02:19:23,080
That's the argument that Ari and I were 
discussing,

3113
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:23,943
100 percent.
That's the only answer because you need 

3114
02:19:25,031 --> 02:19:28,370
to default to free speech.
Now I'm not saying if somebody doxing

3115
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:29,203
somebody or somebody directly 
threatening somebody and stuff like 

3116
02:19:30,831 --> 02:19:31,664
that,
there should be a process set up where 

3117
02:19:32,451 --> 02:19:34,040
you can ameliorate that and do it 
quickly.

3118
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:37,280
But having said that,
like people forget man,

3119
02:19:37,281 --> 02:19:41,300
the Acl,
you used to defend the KKK in course,

3120
02:19:41,470 --> 02:19:42,830
or would already brought up.
Yes,

3121
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:43,850
and they said,
hey,

3122
02:19:43,851 --> 02:19:44,900
in Skokie,
they said,

3123
02:19:44,901 --> 02:19:45,734
hey listen,
we know we don't agree with these 

3124
02:19:46,491 --> 02:19:47,420
people.
We think they're heinous.

3125
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:49,070
We think they're terrible.
We think they're dead wrong,

3126
02:19:49,071 --> 02:19:49,904
but they have a right to say what 
they're saying because once you get rid 

3127
02:19:51,321 --> 02:19:53,720
of it for them,
what people don't realize though is that

3128
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:54,554
these things will always come back 
against people who are powerless and 

3129
02:19:57,321 --> 02:19:59,240
marginalized.
It's not like when you censor,

3130
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:01,310
everybody gets together and we all go,
okay,

3131
02:20:01,311 --> 02:20:02,570
so it's just the Nazis,
right?

3132
02:20:02,571 --> 02:20:03,530
Yes.
It's just the Nazis.

3133
02:20:03,531 --> 02:20:04,640
No,
first of all,

3134
02:20:04,641 --> 02:20:06,050
who's running these?
You know,

3135
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:07,093
these organizations,
obviously they have their own opinions 

3136
02:20:09,291 --> 02:20:10,124
and their own vested interests and their
own power dynamic issues and they're 

3137
02:20:12,711 --> 02:20:13,544
going to take down whoever threatens 
their power now is are all these 

3138
02:20:16,071 --> 02:20:19,610
organizations still up on youtube and 
twitter and Google?

3139
02:20:19,611 --> 02:20:20,900
I don't know.
To my knowledge,

3140
02:20:20,901 --> 02:20:23,570
the only one that totally got pulled 
down everywhere I think was Alex Jones.

3141
02:20:23,571 --> 02:20:24,270
He still has

3142
02:20:24,270 --> 02:20:26,920
website here.
It says all but proving the case.

3143
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:29,670
This was a coordinated attack by the 
tech giant community.

3144
02:20:29,671 --> 02:20:32,820
Shortly after the purge on facebook,
twitter follows suit,

3145
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:36,680
wiping out our profiles on there as 
well.

3146
02:20:36,681 --> 02:20:39,290
They gave absolutely no reason for the 
suspension.

3147
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:41,660
Said we had closed the freethought 
umbrella,

3148
02:20:41,661 --> 02:20:44,960
had close to 6 million followers.
Wow.

3149
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:47,540
Isn't that crazy?
And they just decided overnight.

3150
02:20:47,570 --> 02:20:49,460
What's crazy is I didn't even hear 
about.

3151
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:52,900
Well that's why I'm here.
I appreciate you.

3152
02:20:53,610 --> 02:20:56,690
I mean I had heard that it was 800 
different pages,

3153
02:20:56,691 --> 02:20:57,524
but the way I'd read it,
and I unfortunately don't have a lot of 

3154
02:21:01,401 --> 02:21:02,234
time and I was flipping through 
something I'd read that it was a lot of 

3155
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:07,220
um,
anti-police pages.

3156
02:21:07,290 --> 02:21:10,530
Some of them were anti police,
but I think a lot of them were not.

3157
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:13,050
A lot of them were antiestablishment 
anti corruption,

3158
02:21:13,051 --> 02:21:14,550
like they've always had it out for 
wikileaks.

3159
02:21:14,580 --> 02:21:16,230
For example,
Wiki leaks as well.

3160
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:17,910
I mean,
you've had mike pump hale,

3161
02:21:17,911 --> 02:21:21,360
one of the top trump administration 
officials because it says they're like a

3162
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:25,020
nonstate terrorist actor.
Think about that.

3163
02:21:25,021 --> 02:21:25,854
That's nuts.
That is because basically what they do 

3164
02:21:27,451 --> 02:21:30,540
is what discharging reporters should 
say,

3165
02:21:30,541 --> 02:21:31,980
hey,
here's what the bad guy,

3166
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:32,903
here's what the people in the government
are doing and this is the stuff that 

3167
02:21:34,231 --> 02:21:36,030
they're keeping secret that they 
shouldn't keep secret,

3168
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:37,140
and our government goes,
oh,

3169
02:21:37,141 --> 02:21:37,980
that's terrorism.

3170
02:21:38,390 --> 02:21:40,640
Now,
when twitter or one of these people,

3171
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:42,890
one of these organizations,
bands,

3172
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:47,720
something like the free thought project,
do they make any statements or they just

3173
02:21:47,721 --> 02:21:48,280
remove them

3174
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:49,113
all?
I saw what was on the Guardian article 

3175
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:51,513
and on the Guardian they said it was 
inauthentic behavior was the reason why 

3176
02:21:53,981 --> 02:21:54,814
they were pulling them and maybe one or 
two other things that I'm forgetting at 

3177
02:21:56,441 --> 02:21:56,910
the moment.

3178
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:59,280
That is a fucking weird statement.
I know.

3179
02:21:59,281 --> 02:22:00,920
Authentic behavior.
Yeah.

3180
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:03,350
Yeah.
It's fucked up man,

3181
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:05,900
because they could just do it to 
anybody.

3182
02:22:06,020 --> 02:22:07,670
That's the point and that's what's so 
scary.

3183
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:08,810
Well,
that is what scary,

3184
02:22:08,811 --> 02:22:09,644
right?
Is that there are private companies and 

3185
02:22:12,171 --> 02:22:15,320
these people are allowed to post on them
until they decide they're not allowed to

3186
02:22:15,321 --> 02:22:17,540
post on them because they violate their 
terms of service,

3187
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:22,810
but when your terms of service with are 
that open ended inauthentic behavior,

3188
02:22:23,151 --> 02:22:25,980
like what the fuck does that even mean?
So

3189
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,813
they just.
They leave the terms of service 

3190
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:29,113
purposefully vague so that they can get 
away with knocking off wherever they 

3191
02:22:31,531 --> 02:22:32,364
want to knock off.
It's just weird that they all agreed 

3192
02:22:35,010 --> 02:22:35,843
that facebook agreed and twitter agreed.
Like what would be the incentive of 

3193
02:22:38,971 --> 02:22:39,804
twitter to follow suit?
Will it be the incentive smokey back 

3194
02:22:42,211 --> 02:22:46,170
room given to.
If you had to speculate.

3195
02:22:46,190 --> 02:22:48,270
Okay.
What do you think would be given to them

3196
02:22:48,271 --> 02:22:49,104
that would give them the incentive to 
want to pull a site that's kind of like 

3197
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:54,960
Jack Dorsey guys seems pretty socially 
progressive.

3198
02:22:55,050 --> 02:22:57,990
I think they are meeting just like what 
we said,

3199
02:22:57,991 --> 02:22:58,824
we know they did this with Israel where 
they pulled down pro Palestinian human 

3200
02:23:01,411 --> 02:23:04,770
rights pages to allow facebook to 
function in their country.

3201
02:23:04,771 --> 02:23:05,970
They said you have to do x,
Y,

3202
02:23:05,971 --> 02:23:07,920
and Z dot.
I think that there are meetings with,

3203
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:10,260
I don't know exactly who it is,
our intelligence agencies,

3204
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:11,580
law enforcement,
FBI,

3205
02:23:11,581 --> 02:23:12,240
I don't know.

3206
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:13,073
Somebody like that.
Maybe CEO's of various corporations 

3207
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:16,830
where they say,
hey man,

3208
02:23:16,831 --> 02:23:18,720
listen,
these people are problem.

3209
02:23:18,721 --> 02:23:20,520
These people are problem.
These people are a problem.

3210
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:21,593
Let's do the right thing here.
I would like to hear a contrary 

3211
02:23:23,701 --> 02:23:25,290
argument.
Well,

3212
02:23:25,291 --> 02:23:26,760
I don't know.
I would like to know immediately.

3213
02:23:26,790 --> 02:23:30,810
I would like to know like what is the.
What is the contrary argument?

3214
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:33,240
Is there anything that we're missing?
If we want,

3215
02:23:33,241 --> 02:23:35,850
we could try to find the guardian 
article and read what they said,

3216
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:38,640
what twitter said,
what twitter and facebook says,

3217
02:23:38,641 --> 02:23:42,360
see if you could find that,
you know the Guardian article.

3218
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:46,050
It's not coming up and pulled it off the
internet guardian.

3219
02:23:46,130 --> 02:23:47,240
What did,
what was the headline?

3220
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:48,093
Searched it and went on news and like 
there was no articles from the Guardian 

3221
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:52,020
by the way,
the only two.

3222
02:23:52,590 --> 02:23:56,310
The only two things I found,
the only two things I found it on rt and

3223
02:23:56,311 --> 02:23:57,144
the Guardian and nothing else,
which is why you didn't hear about it 

3224
02:23:59,131 --> 02:24:01,410
because mainstream media didn't talk 
about it because guess what?

3225
02:24:01,650 --> 02:24:03,870
These outlets,
oftentimes our competition to mainstream

3226
02:24:03,871 --> 02:24:08,871
media.
What the fuck man that is.

3227
02:24:10,830 --> 02:24:15,830
So the Alex Jones thing is really like a
test run almost pretty much searching on

3228
02:24:16,621 --> 02:24:18,390
their website,
on the Guardian website,

3229
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:19,253
rethought project that's using google to
do it and the top article is something 

3230
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:27,270
about food in 2013.
Well when we get off here,

3231
02:24:27,271 --> 02:24:29,310
I'll do a search and we can see if we 
could find a statement.

3232
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:30,413
Yeah.
But when we get unfair is not helping 

3233
02:24:31,351 --> 02:24:34,720
all those people.
The newest right now they saw it.

3234
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:36,083
They saw the article from the free 
thought project and that says the same 

3235
02:24:37,681 --> 02:24:38,514
information.
We just don't have the exact statement 

3236
02:24:39,421 --> 02:24:41,540
from twitter and facebook on it.
That's the only thing.

3237
02:24:41,541 --> 02:24:46,100
See if you can just google statement 
from twitter that wasn't involved.

3238
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:47,460
The free thought that wasn't in the 
article.

3239
02:24:47,461 --> 02:24:49,140
They just threw it in the middle of the 
article.

3240
02:24:49,410 --> 02:24:53,190
It was like facebook and twitter purges 
accounts for,

3241
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:55,380
I don't know if it's an inauthentic 
behavior in the title,

3242
02:24:55,381 --> 02:24:56,214
but it was an article somewhere,
so you really think that there's some 

3243
02:24:58,351 --> 02:25:01,080
sort of smokey back room deals where 
they say,

3244
02:25:01,081 --> 02:25:03,930
listen to you,
you guys are making tons of money.

3245
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:06,300
We've got a bit of an issue here.
Let's work through this.

3246
02:25:06,301 --> 02:25:07,134
This is what we want removed.
These people are causing us a bunch of 

3247
02:25:08,971 --> 02:25:10,740
problems.
I don't know,

3248
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:13,740
but I,
I do know they did that in Israel.

3249
02:25:13,741 --> 02:25:16,710
I do know that they do that in all these
countries where the government say,

3250
02:25:16,711 --> 02:25:18,540
hey,
in order to function here you have to do

3251
02:25:18,541 --> 02:25:18,931
x,
Y,

3252
02:25:18,931 --> 02:25:21,360
and Z,
so why wouldn't they do that in the US?

3253
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:23,513
That's what I would say to that.
But what groups would want the free 

3254
02:25:26,351 --> 02:25:28,960
thought project or police the police 
removed?

3255
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:30,760
Well,
you gotta remember a lot of these.

3256
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:33,520
So the police accountability groups,
I mean it's pretty easy law enforcement.

3257
02:25:33,530 --> 02:25:34,660
What would want that removed?
Right.

3258
02:25:34,661 --> 02:25:35,494
But do you think law enforcement has the
kind of pulled to go to twitter and not 

3259
02:25:38,321 --> 02:25:38,951
like the,
you know,

3260
02:25:38,951 --> 02:25:41,050
whatever.
The Police Department in Toledo,

3261
02:25:41,051 --> 02:25:42,850
but if the FBI maybe.
Sure,

3262
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:47,980
or the CIA or whoever,
major law enforcement,

3263
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:50,640
general law enforcement,
the thing that people kept going to with

3264
02:25:50,641 --> 02:25:52,810
Alex Jones was Sandy Hook,
Sandy Hook.

3265
02:25:52,811 --> 02:25:53,644
He said children didn't get the sale.
You don't have to defend Alex Jones on 

3266
02:25:56,381 --> 02:25:58,150
the merits of that point because he's 
dead wrong.

3267
02:25:58,151 --> 02:25:58,984
On that point,
when you're descending is the principle 

3268
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:02,380
of letting somebody speak.
I understand.

3269
02:26:02,381 --> 02:26:03,700
Yeah.
That's not what I'm saying.

3270
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:07,870
What I'm saying is there's no thing that
they're going to on this,

3271
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:10,450
so it's like there's already been a 
precedent set.

3272
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:11,830
They could just remove people.

3273
02:26:12,250 --> 02:26:14,970
So they removed him.
They got this here.

3274
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,130
It got sloppier.
Yeah.

3275
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:20,590
Well it got more clandestine because 
there's no.

3276
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:22,810
There's no big smoking gun.
There's no nothing.

3277
02:26:22,811 --> 02:26:24,550
It's just all of a sudden the yanked.
Yep.

3278
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:27,550
That's right.
And again,

3279
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:30,730
no major mainstream media outlet in the 
US reported on it.

3280
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:34,140
Our is Russia today.
Jamie's got exact article.

3281
02:26:34,170 --> 02:26:35,003
Okay.
There's this image of all media by 

3282
02:26:36,821 --> 02:26:41,821
facebook is pushing back just to 
beginning censorship in state.

3283
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:44,200
They may cite the Guardian article in 
this article.

3284
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:49,090
I was looking more about because I saw 
this article that came out,

3285
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:52,960
it's us pushing back today from today.
This is from today.

3286
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:56,140
Today I saw a different article on the 
same.

3287
02:26:56,150 --> 02:26:57,730
Scroll down and make that a little 
bigger please.

3288
02:26:59,650 --> 02:27:00,400
Hm.

3289
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:01,233
So that.
So people were starting to catch onto 

3290
02:27:02,171 --> 02:27:04,420
it.
Scroll left so we can see.

3291
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:05,293
There you go.
The latest appearance of an apparent 

3292
02:27:07,790 --> 02:27:08,623
censorship of political speech online us
based tech giants this month shut down 

3293
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:14,830
hundreds of user accounts,
some belonged to wells to abis.

3294
02:27:14,831 --> 02:27:17,590
Alternative media outlets with hundreds 
of thousands of followers,

3295
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:18,873
like the free thought project or 
anti-media senior fellow with German 

3296
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:23,343
Marshall Fund leading think tank,
advocating us global supremacy seems to 

3297
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:30,550
have at least partially taking credit 
for this.

3298
02:27:30,890 --> 02:27:32,350
It says in quotes,
Russia,

3299
02:27:32,351 --> 02:27:33,184
China,
and other foreign states take advantage 

3300
02:27:34,991 --> 02:27:37,390
of our open political system,
Jamie.

3301
02:27:37,391 --> 02:27:38,224
Fly set.
They can invent stories that got 

3302
02:27:40,421 --> 02:27:43,030
repeated and spread through different 
sites.

3303
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:46,960
So we are just starting to push back 
just this last week,

3304
02:27:46,961 --> 02:27:50,710
facebook became began starting to take 
down sites.

3305
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:53,590
So this is just the beginning.
Okay.

3306
02:27:53,591 --> 02:27:58,591
So what they're saying is that these 
websites have been infiltrated by people

3307
02:27:59,141 --> 02:28:01,450
from China and Russia.
Is that what they're saying?

3308
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:05,640
But scroll back up again,
please stop.

3309
02:28:05,970 --> 02:28:06,803
It said China and other foreign states 
take advantage of our open political 

3310
02:28:09,541 --> 02:28:10,620
system.
Russia,

3311
02:28:10,621 --> 02:28:11,454
China.

3312
02:28:11,570 --> 02:28:12,403
So that is.
That is somebody from the German 

3313
02:28:14,890 --> 02:28:15,880
Marshall Fund,
a leading think tank,

3314
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:16,743
advocating us interest,
saying that because we're so scared of 

3315
02:28:18,881 --> 02:28:19,750
Russia,
Russian,

3316
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:22,520
Chinese,
Russian and Chinese infiltration.

3317
02:28:22,521 --> 02:28:24,020
That's why we got to pull down.
So in other words,

3318
02:28:24,021 --> 02:28:24,501
they're saying,
hey,

3319
02:28:24,501 --> 02:28:25,334
maybe these accounts like the free 
thought project are run by people who 

3320
02:28:26,991 --> 02:28:29,570
are trying to destroy America.
So we have to pull them down.

3321
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:30,493
Exactly.
And that's beyond a preposterous 

3322
02:28:32,091 --> 02:28:33,320
argument.
This is what they're saying.

3323
02:28:33,321 --> 02:28:34,154
They're saying they can invent stories.
They get repeated in spread through 

3324
02:28:36,741 --> 02:28:39,740
different sites.
So we're just starting to push back just

3325
02:28:39,741 --> 02:28:42,110
this last week.
Facebook again started take downsides to

3326
02:28:42,111 --> 02:28:42,944
this.
Just the beginning.

3327
02:28:43,070 --> 02:28:43,903
So they're,
they're blaming the influence of Russia 

3328
02:28:46,371 --> 02:28:47,204
and China and that they're saying that 
this is their excuse for taking down 

3329
02:28:50,751 --> 02:28:55,040
these pages because these pages are 
being compromised by foreign agents.

3330
02:28:55,070 --> 02:28:56,780
It's the oldest trick in the book to 
say,

3331
02:28:56,781 --> 02:28:59,420
Oh,
these foreign entities or sowing discord

3332
02:28:59,421 --> 02:29:00,254
in the United States,
so therefore we're not going to allow 

3333
02:29:01,941 --> 02:29:03,410
this dialogue to happen.
In fact,

3334
02:29:03,411 --> 02:29:04,244
I remember they blamed Russia for black 
lives matter facebook pages during the 

3335
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:08,564
2016 election,
but what's fucked up about this is 

3336
02:29:10,251 --> 02:29:12,120
there's not even any smoking gun.
There's.

3337
02:29:13,060 --> 02:29:14,810
There's no evidence.
They just say it,

3338
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:15,703
right?
They're not,

3339
02:29:15,820 --> 02:29:18,470
but they're not even pointing to a 
specific example.

3340
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:19,333
Yeah,
that's right.

3341
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:20,780
Any example where,
yes,

3342
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:22,093
you're correct.
Scroll down and see if there's anything 

3343
02:29:24,891 --> 02:29:26,780
in this that makes any sense.

3344
02:29:28,010 --> 02:29:28,843
According to the account,
flying complained that any person with 

3345
02:29:31,281 --> 02:29:32,114
an email and set up an account on social
media and potentially reach a wide 

3346
02:29:35,151 --> 02:29:38,990
audience,
you're predicting a long global struggle

3347
02:29:38,991 --> 02:29:42,920
to fix the situation.
Jesus Christ.

3348
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:44,120
Oh,
great.

3349
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:44,953
He started his career as the US 
political circles as an advisor to 

3350
02:29:47,211 --> 02:29:50,450
George W dot Bush administration is 
always trust those people.

3351
02:29:50,630 --> 02:29:51,463
Also a foreign policy and national 
security consultant for this Senator 

3352
02:29:55,011 --> 02:29:55,844
Marco Rubio.
These are the geniuses who should 

3353
02:29:58,311 --> 02:29:59,580
regulate the Internet,
right?

3354
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:02,810
These guys who've been wrong about 
everything reliably.

3355
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:03,800
Well,
this is the thing,

3356
02:30:03,801 --> 02:30:05,210
if you could just say,
oh,

3357
02:30:05,211 --> 02:30:09,200
the Russians have influenced this,
the Russians are a part of this,

3358
02:30:09,201 --> 02:30:10,880
the Chinese,
okay,

3359
02:30:10,881 --> 02:30:11,714
pull it.
It's hacky and it's partisan and it 

3360
02:30:13,491 --> 02:30:15,740
actually works for on the left and the 
right.

3361
02:30:15,741 --> 02:30:16,574
Sometimes it works on Corporate 
Democrats and people who want to blame 

3362
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:22,490
Hillary's election loss on the Russians 
and it works on you that played that.

3363
02:30:22,491 --> 02:30:27,370
Let's hear him talk because you're a 
little bit of it.

3364
02:30:28,090 --> 02:30:30,640
Can I go to the bathroom real quick?
I'll be right back

3365
02:30:33,580 --> 02:30:34,413
here.

3366
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:35,393
Principles values as one of our greatest
strengths and therefore one of the best 

3367
02:30:38,971 --> 02:30:39,804
ways to weaken us.
So I think that that's one of the key 

3368
02:30:42,721 --> 02:30:47,160
things to understand here is Putin's 
acting actually out of weakness and why

3369
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:48,153
we jamie not come to understand or at 
least the consciousness in this country 

3370
02:30:51,491 --> 02:30:53,510
does not necessarily view Putin

3371
02:30:54,090 --> 02:30:54,923
aligned with other strong men figures.
This has been a long running problem in 

3372
02:30:59,011 --> 02:30:59,844
American foreign policy.
This is not just a problem that started 

3373
02:31:02,041 --> 02:31:05,670
with President Donald Trump.
I served in the Bush administration.

3374
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:06,533
President George W dot Bush tried to 
form a relationship with Vladimir Putin 

3375
02:31:10,201 --> 02:31:13,560
to get certain things to advance us.
National Security.

3376
02:31:14,070 --> 02:31:17,370
President Obama tried the same thing 
with is reset of Russian,

3377
02:31:17,450 --> 02:31:18,283
a US Russian relations.
So it's not unusual that you have an 

3378
02:31:21,661 --> 02:31:22,494
administration that maybe doesn't 
necessarily view Russia as the threat 

3379
02:31:25,591 --> 02:31:27,030
that it is.
Um,

3380
02:31:27,031 --> 02:31:30,360
I think the politics of this,
the public opinion right now,

3381
02:31:30,361 --> 02:31:31,194
it's very interesting because you've 
actually seen a shift over the last 

3382
02:31:34,170 --> 02:31:35,003
several years.
More Democrats now actually I think 

3383
02:31:36,630 --> 02:31:38,850
actually view Russia and Putin as a 
threat,

3384
02:31:39,430 --> 02:31:41,140
uh,
compared to where they were still here.

3385
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:44,860
But boy,
this gives you,

3386
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:47,060
it just leaves a bad taste in your 
mouth,

3387
02:31:47,630 --> 02:31:52,630
is the idea that these people are just 
deciding to remove pages and there going

3388
02:31:55,771 --> 02:31:56,604
on television giving these interviews,
saying that it's because of Russia and 

3389
02:31:59,341 --> 02:32:03,160
Putin without any evidence.
Oh,

3390
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:07,150
so maybe they didn't share the evidence.
You've got to say something,

3391
02:32:07,151 --> 02:32:08,200
man.
I mean,

3392
02:32:08,201 --> 02:32:10,930
if you want to be.
If you believe in a free society and you

3393
02:32:10,931 --> 02:32:11,764
believe in freedom of speech and freedom
of expression and you censorship censor 

3394
02:32:15,101 --> 02:32:16,480
people are shit,
Bro,

3395
02:32:16,481 --> 02:32:17,380
what's going on here?

3396
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:19,050
I'll fix it.
I would only go with that.

3397
02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:20,370
And maybe that,
um,

3398
02:32:20,610 --> 02:32:21,690
what happened?
Nothing.

3399
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:24,370
So it's something that they don't have a
fix for the,

3400
02:32:24,430 --> 02:32:26,880
for the way that it's happening.
So if you show the evidence,

3401
02:32:26,881 --> 02:32:27,714
then you're,
you're literally showing the criminals 

3402
02:32:29,101 --> 02:32:29,934
how to how to do this and it could just 
run more rampant and they got to plug 

3403
02:32:32,851 --> 02:32:33,490
more holes.

3404
02:32:33,490 --> 02:32:36,580
Well that would be the devil's advocate 
position,

3405
02:32:36,581 --> 02:32:37,414
but in order to take people down,
the thing is if they're doing it and no 

3406
02:32:42,521 --> 02:32:43,690
one's pushing back,

3407
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:45,793
you're just going to be able to do it 
with anybody that disagrees with you or 

3408
02:32:47,601 --> 02:32:48,434
anybody that's going to be an impediment
to your political campaign or anyone's 

3409
02:32:50,961 --> 02:32:53,240
getting the way of anything you're 
trying to push through.

3410
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:54,793
And then this is,
this is a giant issue with people that 

3411
02:32:57,561 --> 02:33:00,140
have that kind of power that can 
influence facebook or twitter.

3412
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:02,180
And if that's the case,
and look,

3413
02:33:02,181 --> 02:33:04,970
we don't know,
we haven't talked to Zuckerberg,

3414
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,130
we haven't talked to Jack Dorsey,
we don't know who's,

3415
02:33:07,490 --> 02:33:08,323
who's pulling strings or who's asking 
them to do things or what evidence they 

3416
02:33:10,641 --> 02:33:13,730
presented to them.
But that's just very uncomfortable.

3417
02:33:13,731 --> 02:33:18,050
It's very uncomfortable to see that guy 
talking and bringing up Russia and Putin

3418
02:33:18,051 --> 02:33:19,960
because people bring them up.
Like they're the man,

3419
02:33:20,270 --> 02:33:21,103
you know,
this is what's the brushing poot 

3420
02:33:22,270 --> 02:33:22,641
they're,
they're,

3421
02:33:22,641 --> 02:33:23,474
they're interfering with our democracy,
interfering with our issues here in 

3422
02:33:26,211 --> 02:33:27,044
America and they,
they want to ruin democracy and bring 

3423
02:33:29,331 --> 02:33:30,940
our country down from the inside.

3424
02:33:31,580 --> 02:33:32,241
Yeah.
It was like,

3425
02:33:32,241 --> 02:33:33,074
um,
the Internet went through a phase of 

3426
02:33:34,491 --> 02:33:35,324
like just totally free and open wild 
wild west type thing and now it looks 

3427
02:33:39,441 --> 02:33:42,380
like they're trying to reel it back in.
And it's like,

3428
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:45,140
that's the viewed as the public square.
It's supposed to be the,

3429
02:33:45,141 --> 02:33:45,974
these social media outlets which are so 
gigantic and so powerful that this is 

3430
02:33:49,071 --> 02:33:52,670
now the public square.
So to be able to censor people in these,

3431
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:55,760
in these forums should be considered 
unconstitutional,

3432
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:58,850
coordinated,
inauthentic behavior.

3433
02:33:58,880 --> 02:33:59,451
Oh,
you found it.

3434
02:33:59,451 --> 02:34:00,890
You found articles spamming

3435
02:34:02,070 --> 02:34:02,903
hm,

3436
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:06,300
but again,
the like the websites that they actually

3437
02:34:06,301 --> 02:34:10,530
pulled down,
that totally destroys their argument.

3438
02:34:10,531 --> 02:34:12,420
Even if you buy into the premise that 
these are,

3439
02:34:12,450 --> 02:34:14,310
this is a good reason to pull somebody 
down.

3440
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:17,980
I mean some of the people,
the pages

3441
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:18,813
they pulled down were so well 
established and there are of course not 

3442
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:22,713
inauthentic in any way.
It's people who are running these pages 

3443
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:25,293
that really deeply care about these 
issues and want to get this news out to 

3444
02:34:27,371 --> 02:34:29,780
people.
Fuck,

3445
02:34:31,350 --> 02:34:32,183
this is a good quote here.
Drawing the line between real and 

3446
02:34:35,231 --> 02:34:36,064
inauthentic views is a difficult 
enterprise that could put everything 

3447
02:34:38,261 --> 02:34:39,094
from impartial political parody to 
genuine but outlandish views on the 

3448
02:34:42,341 --> 02:34:46,720
chopping block and find us.
There are politicians in the US.

3449
02:34:46,721 --> 02:34:47,554
This happened during the debate between 
Ted Cruz and Beta O'rourke all at the 

3450
02:34:50,711 --> 02:34:54,340
exact same time with the exact same 
hashtags.

3451
02:34:54,460 --> 02:34:57,460
There were pro ted Cruz.
Things tweeted out at once,

3452
02:34:57,610 --> 02:34:58,443
so at that is their bots that they 
bought to help Ted Cruz win the 

3453
02:35:00,551 --> 02:35:02,410
election.
That's election interference.

3454
02:35:02,470 --> 02:35:03,303
That's inauthentic behavior and nobody's
talking about pulling down those 

3455
02:35:05,771 --> 02:35:07,990
accounts.
Look at what it says here in a statement

3456
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:09,190
posted online newsroom.

3457
02:35:09,190 --> 02:35:12,640
Facebook says it,
purge those pages because they're owners

3458
02:35:12,641 --> 02:35:13,474
were using fake accounts,
sharing the same content between 

3459
02:35:16,151 --> 02:35:19,500
multiple pages and linking to add 
supported websites.

3460
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:24,540
It calls ad farms,
so what that doesn't even is that even a

3461
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:26,860
controversial,
but this is where it gets interesting it

3462
02:35:26,861 --> 02:35:27,694
says,
but what the social network calls spam 

3463
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:35,350
the owners of these pages call standard 
procedures for operating on facebook.

3464
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:37,630
Yeah.
That was like.

3465
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:42,310
I don't even think if the argument from 
facebook is correct that there really is

3466
02:35:42,311 --> 02:35:44,380
a reason to pull them down and go.
It says here,

3467
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:47,010
nearly all the page owners contact by 
the Guardian,

3468
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:49,930
say they use backup or fake accounts.
Hmm.

3469
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:53,800
Along with their real ones,
they do it in part to protect themselves

3470
02:35:53,801 --> 02:35:57,610
from being targeted by political 
opponents and having their real accounts

3471
02:35:57,700 --> 02:36:01,240
end up in facebook jail.
Reverse press,

3472
02:36:01,241 --> 02:36:03,850
a left leaning news site whose facebook 
page disappear yesterday,

3473
02:36:03,851 --> 02:36:05,440
so this is on the left and the right.

3474
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:07,900
They're censoring people because you got
snowflakes on the right.

3475
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:09,720
There's another one right wing news that
was pulled down.

3476
02:36:09,730 --> 02:36:10,630
Stop scrolling.
Please,

3477
02:36:10,980 --> 02:36:12,190
but,
but look at this,

3478
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:13,053
this is really interesting there w,
so they're admitting to disingenuous 

3479
02:36:17,381 --> 02:36:18,214
behavior though they're using fake 
accounts to protect themselves were 

3480
02:36:22,011 --> 02:36:24,890
being targeted by political opponents.
Well it's,

3481
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:30,270
but that's if that's the case,
they are violating facebook policy.

3482
02:36:30,370 --> 02:36:31,203
So I've seen this on twitter.
I know people who have gotten their 

3483
02:36:33,041 --> 02:36:33,874
accounts banned on twitter but they 
create a new account and they stay on 

3484
02:36:35,771 --> 02:36:38,050
twitter and that's technically a 
violation of terms of service,

3485
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:41,650
but it also is something that I don't 
think is religious at all.

3486
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:42,513
Right.
But there's a big difference between 

3487
02:36:42,821 --> 02:36:44,920
someone getting banned and then starting
a fake,

3488
02:36:44,950 --> 02:36:47,310
a second account.
This is not that they're,

3489
02:36:47,320 --> 02:36:51,760
they're using multiple accounts at the 
same time and some of them are fake.

3490
02:36:51,790 --> 02:36:52,271
Look,
I'm not,

3491
02:36:52,271 --> 02:36:53,104
I'm not justifying their being banned,
but I am saying that they violated 

3492
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:57,573
certain procedures and they did so in 
order to public publicize their ideas 

3493
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:06,010
and they did it to try to make their 
ideas more,

3494
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:09,520
just more project them more have have 
more,

3495
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:11,470
more bandwidth.
But according to facebook,

3496
02:37:11,471 --> 02:37:12,304
should you not be allowed to have like 
three or four accounts where you tweet 

3497
02:37:14,501 --> 02:37:15,334
the same stuff or post the same stuff?
Because it seems like you said though 

3498
02:37:17,961 --> 02:37:20,270
what facebook said,
if you scroll back up to the beginning,

3499
02:37:20,330 --> 02:37:22,510
scroll back up at the beginning please.
That's part of the top.

3500
02:37:23,030 --> 02:37:24,260
The top,
the top,

3501
02:37:24,261 --> 02:37:25,580
top.
See what it says.

3502
02:37:25,581 --> 02:37:28,640
A coordinated inauthentic behavior and 
spamming.

3503
02:37:28,641 --> 02:37:29,474
So they were spamming and that does 
sound like coordinated inauthentic 

3504
02:37:32,601 --> 02:37:35,330
behavior.
If they have a bunch of alternative fake

3505
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:40,040
sites and fake pages that they using to 
spread their stuff.

3506
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:40,903
Look,
I'm not saying that they should have 

3507
02:37:41,811 --> 02:37:43,520
been.
This is,

3508
02:37:43,670 --> 02:37:46,550
I think better would be to say,
hey,

3509
02:37:46,551 --> 02:37:47,384
you can't do that.
You've got to remove these fake pages 

3510
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:55,040
that are publicizing your ideas and just
have your real authentic page.

3511
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:56,233
But what they're saying is that they're,
they're leaking to add farms and that 

3512
02:38:00,801 --> 02:38:05,801
they use this to publicize their pages 
and that everybody does it.

3513
02:38:06,980 --> 02:38:09,140
Everybody does it.
You're not supposed to do it.

3514
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:10,063
So why wouldn't they pulled?
So let's say the free thought project 

3515
02:38:12,300 --> 02:38:14,810
have three or four other things where 
they were posting the same stuff under a

3516
02:38:14,811 --> 02:38:15,644
different name.
Why would you not pull down to three or 

3517
02:38:16,581 --> 02:38:18,680
four other things and leave up to the 
free thought project?

3518
02:38:18,681 --> 02:38:19,514
I think they're saying [inaudible] the 
free thought project violated their 

3519
02:38:21,591 --> 02:38:23,630
terms of service.
You're not supposed to do that.

3520
02:38:23,631 --> 02:38:24,830
So you don't want them to do that.

3521
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:25,970
I don't know.
See,

3522
02:38:25,971 --> 02:38:26,804
here's the thing.
Would they have pulled the free thought 

3523
02:38:28,371 --> 02:38:32,280
project down if they hadn't engaged in 
any of these forbidden behaviors?

3524
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:37,610
My opinion is I think yes,
maybe that's what I think may be,

3525
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:38,713
but that is gross.
You're not supposed to do that and I'm 

3526
02:38:41,721 --> 02:38:44,930
not saying that they should be pulled,
they shouldn't be pulled,

3527
02:38:45,350 --> 02:38:50,000
but maybe they thought this is what they
have to do to get the word out and maybe

3528
02:38:50,001 --> 02:38:50,990
facebook is like,
hey,

3529
02:38:50,991 --> 02:38:51,824
you fucks are spamming and you're.
You're linking to these ad farms and 

3530
02:38:56,450 --> 02:38:57,283
these ad farms have been known to be 
influenced by Russia and China and all 

3531
02:39:01,611 --> 02:39:02,444
these other organizations.
You're doing it just to promote your 

3532
02:39:04,281 --> 02:39:05,114
sites.
But we're saying that we can't allow 

3533
02:39:06,711 --> 02:39:07,544
that kind of behavior.
It just strikes me as very strange that 

3534
02:39:10,371 --> 02:39:11,204
when you have examples like the one I 
just gave were maturing the ted Cruz 

3535
02:39:14,241 --> 02:39:15,200
Beto O'Rourke debate.

3536
02:39:15,470 --> 02:39:17,780
They all tweeted the same thing at the 
same time.

3537
02:39:17,781 --> 02:39:20,060
It was obviously paid for by some right 
wing think tank.

3538
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:22,430
You never hear the story of something 
like that.

3539
02:39:22,431 --> 02:39:24,740
If it's benefiting us politician or 
something.

3540
02:39:24,741 --> 02:39:25,574
Like when Mitt Romney bought like a 
million fake followers on twitter and 

3541
02:39:27,501 --> 02:39:29,720
the 2012 election,
you never hear about like,

3542
02:39:29,721 --> 02:39:31,010
okay,
we targeted that.

3543
02:39:31,011 --> 02:39:31,850
It's always like,
oh,

3544
02:39:31,851 --> 02:39:34,430
it just happens to be these independent 
alternative media outlets.

3545
02:39:34,431 --> 02:39:35,264
They're spreading the information that 
the government doesn't want people to 

3546
02:39:37,251 --> 02:39:37,911
know.
Well,

3547
02:39:37,911 --> 02:39:39,950
it could be that these people are 
saying,

3548
02:39:39,951 --> 02:39:42,020
hey look,
everybody does this.

3549
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:42,883
We're going to do this.
And they're saying we don't like them 

3550
02:39:44,301 --> 02:39:45,260
there.
Oh,

3551
02:39:45,261 --> 02:39:47,600
and look,
we caught them doing something we.

3552
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:49,350
We don't allow.
Yeah,

3553
02:39:49,820 --> 02:39:52,040
let's sweep them.
But that's possible.

3554
02:39:52,220 --> 02:39:53,053
Is it possible that they wouldn't have 
been removed if they hadn't done this 

3555
02:39:56,241 --> 02:39:57,530
shit than not supposed to do?

3556
02:39:58,100 --> 02:39:59,720
It's possible,
but I don't think it's likely.

3557
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:01,670
I don't know though because here's the 
thing,

3558
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:02,803
how look if it's only people who've 
engaged in these forbidden behaviors 

3559
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:11,510
that get removed,
then facebook has a very good argument,

3560
02:40:11,511 --> 02:40:12,344
but if facebook is saying this,
but then people were removed who are 

3561
02:40:14,851 --> 02:40:18,030
straight above board doing everything 
the right way,

3562
02:40:18,150 --> 02:40:18,983
just have their own page posted 
information on their own page and they 

3563
02:40:21,391 --> 02:40:22,224
were never removed.
But these are all political and 

3564
02:40:24,061 --> 02:40:26,790
alternative media which is interesting.
So they were targeted.

3565
02:40:26,820 --> 02:40:27,510
Yes.
Alright.

3566
02:40:27,510 --> 02:40:30,270
So they're targeted,
but in the targeting them,

3567
02:40:30,271 --> 02:40:31,104
they found a bunch of shit that you're 
not supposed to do and that's what got 

3568
02:40:33,001 --> 02:40:33,834
them removed.

3569
02:40:34,480 --> 02:40:38,710
I think that there is a good argument 
that facebook could make,

3570
02:40:38,711 --> 02:40:41,530
which is very much a nuance troll terms 
of service argument,

3571
02:40:41,531 --> 02:40:42,364
but I think it's more of a veneer or a 
facade than the real heart of why they 

3572
02:40:45,521 --> 02:40:46,450
did what they did.
But again,

3573
02:40:46,510 --> 02:40:48,730
that's just my opinion.
I'm not stating that as a fact.

3574
02:40:48,820 --> 02:40:49,780
I agree with you.
I mean,

3575
02:40:49,781 --> 02:40:53,800
surely what they should have done,
especially given the popularity of these

3576
02:40:53,801 --> 02:40:56,410
sites,
is warn them and say,

3577
02:40:56,411 --> 02:40:59,530
Hey,
you've got to stop doing this because if

3578
02:40:59,531 --> 02:41:01,930
you don't,
we are going to remove you.

3579
02:41:01,931 --> 02:41:02,764
You were violating our terms of service.
You are linking to add farms and you 

3580
02:41:06,071 --> 02:41:09,940
have posted from multiple fake accounts.
Stopped doing that.

3581
02:41:10,150 --> 02:41:12,910
Just use your one authentic account.
We support free speech.

3582
02:41:13,030 --> 02:41:14,200
That's what we both like,
right?

3583
02:41:14,201 --> 02:41:15,070
Yeah,
sure.

3584
02:41:15,550 --> 02:41:16,383
Yeah.
I mean it could be also that they feel 

3585
02:41:17,261 --> 02:41:19,600
like the right wing sites do this.
We have to do this too.

3586
02:41:19,750 --> 02:41:22,990
This is how people do it in 2018 is how 
you really get the word out.

3587
02:41:23,790 --> 02:41:24,530
That true.

3588
02:41:24,530 --> 02:41:25,363
Yeah.
You know,

3589
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:26,283
I just,
I've found it interesting that it was 

3590
02:41:28,011 --> 02:41:31,310
all alternative media and political 
accounts and or left.

3591
02:41:31,311 --> 02:41:32,144
It was just the main thing that seemed 
to be the connecting tissue through it 

3592
02:41:35,031 --> 02:41:40,031
all was relatively antiestablishment.
It's gross.

3593
02:41:41,570 --> 02:41:42,450
It is gross,
man.

3594
02:41:43,190 --> 02:41:45,110
Have you been following what's happening
with Iran at all?

3595
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:46,400
No,
I have not.

3596
02:41:46,490 --> 02:41:49,520
There's a little bit of ramping up of 
tensions now.

3597
02:41:49,550 --> 02:41:51,650
So of course we pulled out of the Iran 
deal,

3598
02:41:51,651 --> 02:41:53,290
the nuclear deal.
Um,

3599
02:41:53,660 --> 02:41:54,493
I don't think that was a good idea 
because according to the IAEA 

3600
02:41:56,961 --> 02:42:00,650
International Atomic Energy Agency,
they verified that six different times.

3601
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:04,970
Iran was following that deal and trump 
pulled out of it.

3602
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:06,890
Anyway,
that hurt are,

3603
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:08,630
you know,
diplomatic talks,

3604
02:42:08,631 --> 02:42:09,464
if you will.
And then this story broke a few weeks 

3605
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:14,120
ago,
the International Criminal Court.

3606
02:42:14,121 --> 02:42:14,954
So Iran sued theU ,
s and according to the International 

3607
02:42:19,490 --> 02:42:19,881
Criminal Court,
they said,

3608
02:42:19,881 --> 02:42:20,571
hey,
we can't,

3609
02:42:20,571 --> 02:42:24,230
we're not allowed to sanction them when 
they allow in humanitarian goods.

3610
02:42:24,590 --> 02:42:28,310
So our response to that was to say,
fuck off International Criminal Court.

3611
02:42:28,311 --> 02:42:30,110
We're not pulling out of the 
International Criminal Court.

3612
02:42:30,650 --> 02:42:33,500
So talks about basically totally broken 
down.

3613
02:42:33,501 --> 02:42:35,490
And now the fear is,
um,

3614
02:42:36,170 --> 02:42:39,230
that we could be on the road to war 
because we have neo-con John Bolton,

3615
02:42:39,231 --> 02:42:41,720
who's in the trump administration,
has always wanted a war with Iran.

3616
02:42:41,870 --> 02:42:44,030
We have Mike Pompeo who also wants war 
with Iran.

3617
02:42:44,510 --> 02:42:45,950
And um,
it's just,

3618
02:42:46,010 --> 02:42:46,843
it's not a good situation because we had
a pretty solid deal there and now it's 

3619
02:42:50,181 --> 02:42:52,310
more likely Iran gets a new if they want
it,

3620
02:42:52,810 --> 02:42:53,643
um,
and the tensions are ramping up and if 

3621
02:42:55,101 --> 02:42:55,934
they blocked it because Iran is 
economies imploding right now and if we 

3622
02:42:59,211 --> 02:43:02,510
block their oil exports,
that's when you know that we're about to

3623
02:43:02,511 --> 02:43:04,310
do some sort of regime change action 
over there.

3624
02:43:05,530 --> 02:43:07,180
Dude,
I have to end this unfortunately.

3625
02:43:07,181 --> 02:43:09,280
Do you have anything happy to say before
we wrap this up?

3626
02:43:09,370 --> 02:43:10,203
No,
I don't.

3627
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:13,120
Listen,
I'm sorry.

3628
02:43:13,121 --> 02:43:15,160
I have 34,
10,

3629
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:18,870
a secular talk.
Give out your youtube address again.

3630
02:43:18,910 --> 02:43:20,530
Sure.
It's youtube.com/secular

3631
02:43:20,531 --> 02:43:23,310
talking on twitter on at Kyle Kalinsky 
Chi.

3632
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:25,090
We've got to do this more often all the 
time,

3633
02:43:25,091 --> 02:43:25,924
man.
When are you going to be back when you 

3634
02:43:26,221 --> 02:43:27,490
don't know,
but next time I'm back.

3635
02:43:27,491 --> 02:43:28,710
I'll definitely be on.
Thanks Bro.

3636
02:43:28,720 --> 02:43:29,620
Appreciate you man.
Thanks man.

3637
02:43:29,621 --> 02:43:30,700
Appreciate you too.
Appreciate it.

3638
