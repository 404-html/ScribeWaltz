1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,190
Do you go in the woods and
hunt and stuff like that?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,070
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,420
Yeah.

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,740
I've been doing that recently.

5
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,680
Really do.

6
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,750
It's fascinating shit.

7
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,200
Do you eat the stuff you hunted?

8
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,730
Yeah,

9
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,590
I try and I'm trying to only eat that.

10
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,420
Do you have a catch phrase when you hunt

11
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,813
when you hit one?

12
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,893
I need one.

13
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,150
Well,

14
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,930
yes.

15
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,870
Blam blam we eat him.

16
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,090
That's awesome.

17
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,923
Need a catch phrase.

18
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,580
That's the perfect one for pig hunting.
