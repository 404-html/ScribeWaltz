1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,140
Have you had your man period lately?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,873
No.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,280
What's and I have this
theory that when we shit,

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,970
then it's all bloody in there that it's
possible that he does it at the same

6
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,410
time like it's based on the moon.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,791
How often do you guys,

8
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,950
Shit when you get born your shit happens.

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,090
Happens every couple of months.

10
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:20,740
It goes for like a week feeling weak.

11
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,710
The hemorrhoid thing,

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,323
my hope.

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,190
Oh my God,

14
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,330
and then you wipe and you just like,

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,571
ah,

16
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm still wiping a lot of shit.

17
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:28,861
Be like,

18
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:29,001
no.

19
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,600
It was just soaking red blood.

20
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:30,920
That's all.

21
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,681
There's no shit in it.

22
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,460
Die On your hand and I got to go
straight through the toilet papers.

23
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,100
Then you guys both need to go to a doctor
together and find out what aliens are

24
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:39,720
raping you in the middle of a shit study.

25
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,660
Do a fucking camera over your bed.

26
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,730
That's something really watched.

27
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,690
Aliens come in the room and take you
through the walls in the middle of the

28
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:46,710
night.

29
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,760
Return you later.

30
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,370
It's sometimes when you
stand up at your toilet seat.

31
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,310
Looks like Dexter,

32
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:53,170
like the blood spots that you know,

33
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,590
we didn't go in the water
if you have too low and man,

34
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:58,140
if you guys are both
shitting out that much blood.

35
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,890
Yeah,

36
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,830
I mean it pours.

37
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,640
It's the warmth.

38
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,890
It's like a warm faucet and turn it over.

39
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,790
Real thin beaker

40
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,470
sell you up for the shot girls.

41
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,390
Those that much water.

42
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,980
Not something to be proud of.

43
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,570
You guys are both really sick.

44
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:15,960
Jamie,

45
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,793
you okay with it?

46
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,480
Or you and I in the same boat?

47
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,890
I can tell you this though.

48
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:23,400
I did have a massive
diarrhea problem last week.

49
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,160
It was really worst diarrhea
problem I've had with a long time.

50
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:29,430
I do not know multiple days or
one diarrhea and multiple days.

51
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,230
I don't know if it was a stomach cold.

52
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,840
I don't know if it was something
that I ate that didn't agree with me,

53
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,830
but it was like one day I had a
headache and my head was like,

54
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,101
wow,

55
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:38,720
I feel sad.

56
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,090
I think it's like a food poisoning issue
cause I had an ha a headache and I was

57
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:42,241
like,

58
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:42,601
man,

59
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,550
I feel weak because it was the hairball.

60
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,271
No,

61
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,104
definitely not.

62
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,973
Definitely no more that.

63
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,491
Yeah,

64
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,420
it was um,

65
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,841
no it was,

66
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:52,020
it was post ham but I
hadn't eaten a ham for days,

67
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,100
but it definitely wasn't that.

68
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:56,790
It was something that I'd had I think
that day or before that day anyway,

69
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,690
diarrhea.

70
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,190
Oh my goodness.

71
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,830
I mean it was more than a
week after I'd eaten the Ham.

72
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:02,730
Now that I think about it.

73
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,060
Did you mix it with a regular
dump and have like a no dude,

74
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:06,910
it was just over the,

75
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,800
this is what happened in our whatever
was going on inside my stomach was

76
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:11,910
converting everything.

77
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,870
I ate into this liquid and
I didn't even make sense.

78
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:17,370
It was like define physics.

79
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
How solidified was it?

80
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,800
It was water.

81
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,720
If you dropped it on a UN inclined
table at a 40 degree in client,

82
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,010
would it go straight off the table?

83
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Take a minute to go ride like a fucking
great wave straight through great brown

84
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:32,730
wave of destruction.

85
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,361
Dude,

86
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,111
it would rumble,

87
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,910
my stomach would rumble
and then I would go,

88
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,660
oh shit and I'd have really bathroom.

89
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,341
Then I'd get to the,

90
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,860
and I would hold it up whole
Marshall's like listen,

91
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,550
I wouldn't,

92
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,260
there's no way I was brave enough to fart.

93
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,580
There was no way.

94
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,120
There was no way cause I would get
into that tub or get it out of the bowl

95
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:48,660
rather.

96
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,810
And I would just hear whoosh just,

97
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,740
just,

98
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,950
just water tub my ass.

99
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,500
Complete water for like two days.

100
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,000
And then it like very untrustworthy shit.

101
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,690
I feel something that's worth day.

102
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,713
Yeah.

103
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,690
And I got hemorrhoids.

104
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:12,691
I had to go get preparation h oh no I
bought one squeezing it and pushing it,

105
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,320
trying to get it to come out so long,

106
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,340
which is really bad.

107
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,810
Pushed air bubbles into your asshole.

108
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,471
Well I think,

109
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:17,671
you know,

110
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,630
squeezing your ass like that,

111
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:22,180
trying to poop is very bad for you.

112
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,050
You're not supposed to do that.

113
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,360
And that's apparently one of the
things that causes hemorrhoids.

114
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,080
Long dumps.

115
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,471
So then,

116
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,390
but the preparation h
is a motherfucker dude.

117
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,550
Cause one day of that
cleared it right up really,

118
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,200
really quickly.

119
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,750
Just get the cooling their
core ranch one or the cool

120
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,660
for cool ranch sets.

121
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Smell refreshing.

122
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,770
Find out people are
like putting it on food.

123
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,240
You can't eat that sir.

124
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,311
Preparation,

125
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,390
h measure preparation.

126
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,390
It was totally edible.

127
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,710
Whatever it does it,

128
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,760
it really works good and a good fixing
any sort of a hemorrhoid situation he got

129
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:55,781
down there,

130
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,070
they went away like within a day.

131
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,320
But man for fucking days,

132
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,000
four days of totally untrustworthy
shits the pasty shit where it's like you

133
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,410
could spread it on brick.

134
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,330
Oh I could spread it and stuff.

135
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
Yeah it was like leaves in there and
shit cause I still eat healthy but it was

136
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:11,710
like a lot of liquid.

137
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,020
It was some sort of a stomach bug,

138
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,190
whatever it was.

139
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:15,731
Um,

140
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:20,050
I don't have any idea where it came
from food or whether it came from just

141
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,860
catching a cold and you know that this
cold manifested itself as a stomach bug.

142
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,330
But whatever it was,

143
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:25,631
man,

144
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,150
it was crazy for a few
days and I felt real weak.

145
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,620
Like I go to pull my bow back and it was
like kind of difficult to pull the bow

146
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,240
back cause you're waiting from stumping?

147
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,283
Yeah,

148
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,940
no I was weak.

149
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,960
I was weak.

150
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,780
Like I would like pick
things out having it.

151
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,121
Yeah,

152
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:40,690
I could feel it.

153
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,250
Her friends.

154
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,740
Yeah.

155
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,071
Yeah,

156
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,500
definitely dehydrated but also
just I wasn't eating right.

157
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,880
Like I wasn't scared.

158
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,290
I wasn't getting hungry either.

159
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,640
I mean I was eating right and that I
was having like lettuce and s and salads

160
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,061
and stuff like that,

161
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,380
but I wasn't eating very much.

162
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,250
I wasn't eating like a like light meals
during the day because my stomach was so

163
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,170
untrustworthy that when
that happened at the area,

164
00:04:59,171 --> 00:04:59,980
what is it?

165
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,460
What's happening?

166
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,091
I don't know man,

167
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,580
but whatever it was just
digesting it just too much.

168
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,720
I would eat like a steak.

169
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,900
I would have steak and some salad
and it would turn it a water.

170
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,840
Like how does steak and a salad become?

171
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,470
I mean my,

172
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,820
my body was liquefying it and
they would come out just whoa,

173
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:16,850
what is that?

174
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,900
Is it too much stomach acid
that just breaking down racism?

175
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,760
I don't know.

176
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,170
The the process.

177
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,470
I should probably know that shit on your
hand a little bit and sort of smelled

178
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,750
it right then and see
if there's some on it.

179
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:32,390
Enzymes on enzymes are
solving a digestion on it.

180
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,250
Pippy piles.

181
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,600
That's how it got me out of it.

182
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,480
I just had to do the time.

183
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,010
I just had to let my body process.

184
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:41,380
That sounds you just drink a
lot of water but in the Reps.

185
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,100
Yeah it was.

186
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,410
I was definitely thinking that I was
probably getting dehydrated from,

187
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,210
I was like so much water's
coming out of my ass.

188
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,790
Like I better make sure I
drink a lot to go with it.

189
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,631
All right.

190
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,010
Does your a hemorrhoid when it happens,

191
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:51,250
does it,

192
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,050
do you even feel the hammering?

193
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,130
Cause I can still feel it.

194
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,760
I feel like it's like,

195
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,390
oh I still have,

196
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,320
there's still some stuff
I've got to wipe off really?

197
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,310
Like oh that's just,

198
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,203
that's just my ass

199
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,060
a little while my bleeds.

200
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,894
I go whale.

201
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,790
Cause like a giant Turd.

202
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,620
That's just my ass now.

203
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,030
That's my shit.

204
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,220
Right.

205
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,410
It feels like what leads out.

206
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,670
It doesn't even feel anything.

207
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,330
It just,

208
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,670
that's that wheel that exploded inside,

209
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,820
isn't it in a way inside.

210
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:15,351
I don't even feel it.

211
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:15,690
Mine's,

212
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,390
mine's on the breast.

213
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,830
They're a diet that you can take,

214
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,320
stops that from happening.

215
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,660
Probably stuck behind hemorrhoids.

216
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,510
Finding foods.

217
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,130
Stop eating broken checks.

218
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,740
Lodge up inside your anal binding
foods and stay away from them.

219
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,431
Or do you a lot of them?

220
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,210
I forgot what it is.

221
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,230
Oh well you should probably know,

222
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,850
but it's one of those two.

223
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,990
So rice was in that group.

224
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,570
Binding foods are definitely away
from him or keep eat a lot of them.

225
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,960
I don't really go by the regimen,

226
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,680
but if you do do that it
would help prevent hemorroids.

227
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,043
Um,

228
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,160
yes,

229
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,070
that's my doctors don't want to.

230
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,460
Got It.

231
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,030
And um,

232
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,690
that's the 19th.

233
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,310
Do you need a lot of solid research?

234
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,091
Um,

235
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:53,680
yeah.

236
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,080
Yeah.

237
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,100
Does that help at all?

238
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:55,581
I don't know.

239
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,930
I feel like it makes you shit more often.

240
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,621
Yeah.

241
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:58,280
But if you,

242
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,700
um,

243
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,010
if you doesn't it come out
like we need a lot of salads.

244
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:02,060
It comes out real easy.

245
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,660
Woo.

246
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:02,871
Oh,

247
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:03,230
right.

248
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,351
Yeah.

249
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:03,591
That's,

250
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,580
I guess a scraping,

251
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,451
pushing.

252
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:10,451
I used to pray it was so Jagat it'd be
so Jagat she claim that I would pray to

253
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,620
have a come out cause it hurts so bad.

254
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,610
Oh that's horrible.

255
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:15,290
That it was just so inflamed in there.

256
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,120
Cause I was just wasn't dumping
cause I knew it would be bad.

257
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:17,451
So I was like,

258
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,470
let me hold it for another few days.

259
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,311
Oh my God.

260
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,910
Days of dumping and get
compacts held off from days,

261
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,763
weeks at a time.

262
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,981
That's insane.

263
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:25,191
Shit.

264
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,024
Every week.

265
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,481
Dude.

266
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,650
That is so insane.

267
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,210
That's so insane.

268
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,540
Yeah.

269
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,310
I've never even heard that's toxic.

270
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,091
Like a,

271
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,480
so for sure you're containing
all that stuff in your body.

272
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:36,800
It's supposed to be evacuated.

273
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,090
Well it's in that spot.

274
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,290
Whatever that spot is.

275
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,800
Not Rubber it fucking,

276
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:41,390
I fill it up.

277
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,900
Dump,

278
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,171
but it,

279
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,960
we become too big for my ow.

280
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,320
Ow Jesus separated.

281
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,510
It's like your first time.

282
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,500
Your first time doing ain't no,

283
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,000
you fucked.

284
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,690
Mandingo that's pretty much what it was.

285
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,190
Use The asshole and it was
probably all dried up in there.

286
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:57,481
Right?

287
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:58,010
Right up.

288
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,740
Oh yeah.

289
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,170
Yeah.

290
00:07:59,170 --> 00:07:59,840
Peace.

291
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,673
Jagged chunk.

292
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,360
Tearing you apart is your shit.

293
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,950
I would have to reach
in sometimes in terror.

294
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,050
Oh,

295
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,830
you had to do that dog
had to get a castrated.

296
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:10,720
Yeah.

297
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,130
Johnny,

298
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,490
I can't get his balls
removed because two things.

299
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:13,791
One,

300
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:18,791
he had an inflated prostate that was
pressing up against his colon and it was

301
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,510
making them constipated
and he was a in the,

302
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,880
in the hospital for a over a week.

303
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,830
I had to bring them in and they had
to try to figure out how to get him to

304
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:34,880
defecate because it's [inaudible] it was
back down and then they found out the

305
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,770
devastation was backed
up cause he was like,

306
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,050
he would like go to defecate,

307
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,691
but then he wouldn't,

308
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,940
it would get on this road and
it's like fucking Dover at Crouch,

309
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:41,774
but he couldn't poop.

310
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,190
And I knew there was something wrong.

311
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,470
So I brought him in and
they found out that it was,

312
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,500
his prostate was enlarged and you know,

313
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,830
he's an older male dog.

314
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,090
He's like seven now.

315
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,021
And so,

316
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:51,440
um,

317
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,490
I got them fixed.

318
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,440
So they take his testicles away,

319
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,740
which makes the prostate decreased to,

320
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,040
and then you got to have room to shit up.

321
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:58,530
Yeah,

322
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:58,891
I used to,

323
00:08:58,891 --> 00:08:59,130
you know,

324
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,030
some people say that,

325
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:00,360
you know,

326
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,991
you should,

327
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:01,230
uh,

328
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,090
you should get a dog fixed and it's like,

329
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,010
it's healthier and happier for the dog.

330
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,030
But I had a veterinary,

331
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,080
didn't agree with that at all.

332
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,960
He said it's totally natural for
that animal to have its testicles.

333
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,501
He goes,

334
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,400
if the dog is,

335
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,290
if you,

336
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,210
you don't want them to breed
and as a female around,

337
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,440
get the female fixed.

338
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,521
And he goes,

339
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:19,200
and if you want to get the dog fixed,

340
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:19,651
you can,

341
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,240
but you don't have to get the dog fixed.

342
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,060
And he's like,

343
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,893
if you're not,

344
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,260
you're not making your dog a dad,

345
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,770
like forcing your dog to have to
breed and make unwanted puppies.

346
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,830
If you're not being irresponsible
with the dogs sexuality,

347
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,240
like you don't have to get the dog fix.

348
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,410
Can you just get it a sec to me?

349
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,000
Why if a cut the balls off,

350
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,980
let it still fuck doggie condoms.

351
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,430
Yeah,

352
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,410
because you don't want that
sense of a dog condoms.

353
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,850
You don't want that swelling.

354
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,280
It's the swelling that comes from the,

355
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:44,401
uh,

356
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:45,780
the testicles and the,

357
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:45,961
uh,

358
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,660
the enlargement of the prostate
that happens as they get older.

359
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,150
And that can be alleviated
by castrating the dog.

360
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,560
So the people get that.

361
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,371
I don't know.

362
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,060
I'm sure they do.

363
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,691
Humans were like,

364
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:55,021
I'm done.

365
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:55,590
Fucking,

366
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,420
I'm 72.

367
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:56,560
Yeah.

368
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,080
Just come on.

369
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,450
Come on.

370
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:57,960
Balls off.

371
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,950
I'm sure people do.

372
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,390
I'm sure there's people who've done that.

373
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,021
I'm sure there's,

374
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:04,610
people have just been tired of being a
prisoner to their cock and balls and just

375
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,831
said,

376
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:05,371
fuck you,

377
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,540
son of a bitch.

378
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,700
You run me for the last time.

379
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,543
Okra done.

380
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,720
Hold them on your hand for sure.

381
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:13,560
People had done that.

382
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,970
Cut Your own balls off.

383
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,863
Oh yeah.

384
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:25,580
Yeah.
