1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,280
Oh good Lord. Ladies and gentlemen,
we're back round two. That's right.

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:09,110
We don't fuck around.
Buya uh,

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,370
this episode is brought to you by
nature box. What's naturebox? Man,

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,320
we'd be hungry at work here. That mouth
of noise that you know what that is?

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,420
That's um, we're kissing. No dairy.
Get bear pressure. That's sweet.

6
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:28,530
Blueberry almonds. That's a nature box
product. Fucking God damn delicious.

7
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,830
You want to try something
to have someone else?

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,030
It's not as good as the Sriracha cashews,

9
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,900
but I almost fucking lost him today cause
young Jamie tried stealing that shit.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,890
Hiding it, hiding the
Sriracha. Cashews you fuck.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,130
Are those rocks cashews controlling or
you got too many of them over there?

12
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:48,240
He sounded, which take them off. He's
got too many. I'm obsessed with Serratia.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,000
Serratia cashews are the Shit
I put Serratia and Coleslaw.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,980
Sriracha cashews are one of the
delicious snacks that naturebox has.

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,970
Hundreds of different delicious
snacks. Guilt free, delicious snacks.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,290
And they know why it's still zero trans
fat, zero high fructose corn syrup.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,710
You can find snacks that
are low on sugar non GM.

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,720
Oh and without gluten.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,130
They ship for free instead of eating
that bullshit that you see in vending

20
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:18,300
machines, you can get nature box delivered

31
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,700
naturebox. Whoops. Don't eat that.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,660
It's a mature buck.
That's not what you want to eat.

33
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,020
Bert Kreischer I'm going to get those.
The Racioppa fucking things are amazing.

34
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:16,420
They're so good. Yeah. The cirrhotic
cashews I'm addicted to, but I'm,

35
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,180
I'm a big fan of these
blueberry almonds too.

36
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,350

44
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,400
Legal Zoom is an awesome way to deal
with a lot of stuff that would be a huge

45
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,870
hassle to take care of ordinarily legal
stuff that you would have to go to a

46
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,870
lawyers office, you'd have to make an
appointment, you'd have to drive there.

47
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,290
You'd have to do it between the hours
of 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM generally.

48
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,990
And a, you would have to do
all of it with your clothes on.

49
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:05,830
You don't have to do any of
that with legal zoom.com.
You can get personal wills,

50
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,340
you could do powers of
attorney living trusts.

51
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,140
They've been doing it for over 10 years.

52
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,820
Legal Zoom has helped protect your
assets with Llcs, s corporations,

53

trademarks, real estate
documents, and more big,

54
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,880
big fan of legal zoom. I'm a fan of
doing anything online. I love it.

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,490
I love the fact that you can take care
of all a lot of shit that you would

56
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,780
normally have to go do.
You get divorced if it's amicable,

57
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,370
if a missus, whoever the fuck your last
name is, decides you look, she's done two,

58
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:39,730
you're both done. You could come to an
agreement, you can do that shit online.

59
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,320
How glorious would that be?

60
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,590
Legal Zoom has an a plus by the
better business bureau. Better.

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,120
I should probably say that smoother. Uh,
but a plus pretty Goddamn groovy. Um,

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,440
that just shows you that there's a fuck
load of people that have used legal zoom

63
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,750
and have benefited from it tremendously.

64
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,380
You don't get an a plus from being an
asshole. And for a special savings,

67
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:14,320
fucking frothy panic. If you're filling
out your forms and you're like, ah,

like the warrior bar or the hemp force

81
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:09,730
protein bar. We just started selling
coffee, started selling caveman coffee.

82
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,750
Uh, we have an on it blend now
brought to you by our pals, um,

83
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,370
Tate Fletcher and Keith Jardine
from Caveman Coffee Company,

84
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,620
a single source coffee provider, a single
estate medium light roast coffee. Yummy,

85
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,660
delicious. I have some right here in my
mind. When I followed Tate on Instagram.

86
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,020
Dude, he's an interesting guy
to follow his life because he's,

87
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,980
he's not like a look at the sunset
kind of guy. No, he's, he's like,

88
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:39,850
I'm teaching a child kettlebells.
He's an awesome dude. Period.

89
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,830
There is no dispute. Um, so I'm,

90
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm very excited that we
started carrying his coffee.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,840
It's a really excellent coffee.
They've worked very hard to, uh,

92
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,060
establish this relationship
with a single source, uh,

93
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,020
in Colombia. Colombian amber. Um,

94
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,800
which was single source means is
they get it directly from the grower.

95
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,650
The grower. Um, they have a direct
relationship with the grower.

96
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,800
The grower takes it, they pick it,
they take care of it, they roast it,

97
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,870
they send it to Albuquerque,
and uh, Albuquerque sends
it to us, the Onnit roast.

98
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,890
Um,

99
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,360
we also have the best strength and
conditioning equipment we can find,

100
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:17,870
whether it's steel, maces,
steel clubs, ab wheels, um,

101
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:22,820
all stuff for functional equipment,
weight vests, medicine balls,

102
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,660
of course, kettlebells including the
Zombie Bells and the primer bell,

103
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,180
primal bells,
artistic kettle bells.

104
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,720
In fact a supplements as far
as far as our supplements go.

105
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,890
We just try to find what is the stuff
that has science behind it was the stuff

106
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:41,270
that has actual scientific references
we could read up and try to figure out

107
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:43,730
what, you know, there's
a lot of Hullabaloo.

108
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,180
Let us Hooli when it comes to supplements
and there's a loss of a lot of

109
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,014
opinions.

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,610
One of the things that you find is there's
a lot of people that like to say that,

111
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,310
you know, certain supplements
known, do anything. Uh,

112
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,110
Alpha brain is especially a controversial
because it is a new tropic supplement.

113
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,970
What nootropic is the idea is that
it enhances cognitive function.

114
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,100
Of course,
that's kind of controversial.

115
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,540
So because of that we have performed
not one, but when we did one,

116
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,800
we're in the middle of a second one,

117
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:16,580
a second clinical trial
plus blind double blind,

118
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,790
placebo controlled clinical trial,
positive results from the first one.

119
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,450
We're very excited about it.
Um,

120
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,550
there's also references on all
of the different ingredients.

121
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,080
There's been studies done on all the
different, uh, aspects of Alpha brain,

122
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:34,820
but we wanted to prove that the
improvement, uh, wasn't just,

123
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,540
uh, based on the individual ingredients,
but they had a synergistic effect.

124
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,470
So we're very excited about the positive
results and we're very excited also

125
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:47,060
that all of our supplements, whether it's
Alpha brain or, um, shroom tech sport,

126
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:50,090
which I have never heard a
single negative thing about.

127
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,360
It's based on the court steps mushroom
and the quarter steps mushroom is

128
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:58,361
something that the Chinese Olympic team
used to a achieve a Olympic gold medals.

129
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,330
I don't know. It's a good question.
Okay. I could read that. 37.

130
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,780
I'd rather just go through it. Why 37 was
about a year. I had a rough, really rough

131
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,350
anyway, this, this commercials too long.

132
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,350

what we're trying to do is just sell

And we do it directly. We package

138
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,120

quality and efficiency and also like the

139
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,790

crusher,
world traveler.

146
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,700
Internationally known locally
respected trip flip. How many,

147
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:17,340
how many trips have you done so far?
Uh,

148

30 40 40 40.

149
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,530
We got another 14 we're doing
starting this weekend too.

150
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:26,220
That's a lot of fucking trips. There's a
lot of fucking the international trips.

151
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:28,470
And how many years has this been?
This is going to be our fourth year.

152
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,030
Fourth year this, so 10
international trips a year for
four years. Holy Shit Dude.

153
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,240
Yeah, that's a lot of fucking
ambulance. A lot. Do you know what,

154
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:40,260
just started flying sober. Whoa. The fuck
is that about because I just met you.

155
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,540
Okay, look, I like partying
and I'm like getting down,

156
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,290
but it's just like by myself on a plane.
Me Drinking Ad Nauseum,

157
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,160
it's just not healthy.

158
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,490
And have you gotten more comfortable
with flying that you're able to achieve

159
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,610
this? It started, I took a flight to
Hawaii with the girls and Leanne was like,

160
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:55,290
let's try it and I,
and I don't want it,

161
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,360
didn't want to get hammered on the plane
with the girl's way and normally do on

162
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,780
a flight to Hawaii. So I didn't drink and
I just, and I got there and I was like,

163
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,450
oh, I took his hand. I took a half
a Xanax. Yeah, we talked about this,

164
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,560
the last podcast actually.

165
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,960
And then I've been working on
it and so like I like our fly,

166
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,400
I'll be with red bound Thursday night
in uh, in San Diego. And then we,

167
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,970
I fly in Friday morning to Phoenix. I
can do that sober. That's a quick flight.

168
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,260
And then I fly back to San Diego. I can
do that sober. And then so short flights,

169
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm good at long ones from Miami.
I have a hard time, six hours,

170
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,290
six hours I start getting in
my head because then I'm like,

171
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,600
what happened one time was I was on
a flight ticket from New York to La.

172
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:31,620
And like halfway through we are in
really bad turbulence and there's no way,

173
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:32,850
there's no instant gratification.

174
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,610
I can't put a Xanax in my mouth and
it just kick in. Right? So like,

175
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,700
so there's no instant gratification. I
know I have like half a Xanax in my body,

176
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,040
so I'm like, fuck it, I'll drink. I don't,
and I know that's bad, but I was like,

177
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,410
I'm going to have a beer and
then it'll heighten the Xanax.

178
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,870
But then I felt like I was having
a heart attack, so I was like,

179
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,870
motherfucker on those flights I got
to roll the dice and pick Xanax.

180
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,930
So I go through like a weather map and
I looked to see what the weather is on

181
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,050
the flight la. And if it's bad, I'm
just like, this is a drinking flight.

182
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:57,780
And I get that.
So this is a drinking flight.

183
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,660
And I get that there's no way around it.
There's no way around it.

184
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,370
It starts in Miami airport and it's like,
yeah, I don't like to drink on praise,

185
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:07,500
but praise.
I don't like to drink on planes,

186
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,350
but I have and I've achieved
some excellent moments.

187
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,770
Like I've had some real fun on planes
being drunk and also real good writing got

188
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:20,340
done on planes. I would like to
drink Budweiser for some reason,

189
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:24,300
which I don't normally drink,
but I like aluminum cans of Budweiser.

190
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,150
I like aluminum cans of Heinikin full.
Can I say,

191
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:28,860
give me the one and I don't want
to get a portrait. I want the,

192
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:30,660
can I say that I'm very specific.

193
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,010
Well you went under the best
feeling to right as my, like my,

194
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,510
this is my fucking moment by
zone is if I cannot drink,

195
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,790
uh, for, uh, for any of the part
of like the, any of the pre board,

196
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,540
any of that.

197
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,280
And then I get one beer before takeoff
and then I take off of the one beer.

198
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,530
My system, I start fucking firing.
Cause I've, I have the fear of death.

199
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,100
I have the life. I had the life going on
like, Hey, this could all end right now,

200
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,660
but I'm like, it's not,
I know it's not Gunna,

201
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,890
but then I just start jamming out
material and I just write like panicked.

202
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,050
Like I,
at one point I wrote on,

203
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:08,200
I was like first time I did it was all
done and Napkins and on the everything I

204
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,440
was writing on everything.
It was for a roast I did for cow head,

205
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:13,690
said Bam and it out. That's
a really good feeling. Yeah.

206
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,740
There's something about being in a plane
that gives you that heightened state of

207
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:21,850
vulnerability that makes your your
creativity sort of fire up a little bit.

208
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,710
I wrote my book, I wrote my
book on a plane. I was on
plane flights to Australia,

209
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,940
to Switzerland,

210
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:32,500
to Italy to Scotland and I just get on
and I just started drinking and just bang

211
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,630
it out, write drunk, edit sober.

212
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,090
So I get in my hotel room that
next day and be like, all right,

213
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,150
let's take a look at what I wrote. I
could not read at at time. I was like,

214
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:44,710
I know this story was this chicken it.
Do you write longhand?

215
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,980
Do you write typing?
I write better typing,

216
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,870
but for jokes I love the art of,
I'm a little, I don't have it on me,

217
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,630
but like do you see like,
uh, like I love to like,

218
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,820
like this past weekend I
increased the size of my,

219
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,300
my road book because I wanted big
cause I want to really like focus.

220
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:05,050
I feel like I'm wasting my forties
by just fucking around on stage.

221
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,500
I want to really write and know what I'm
writing and work on that material and

222
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:12,640
make it better. What do you mean by
wasting? Like one where I get this? Uh,

223
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,790
I love the live by the sword,
die by the sword moment on stage.

224
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,450
I love taking chances
and I love experimenting.

225
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,170
The problem is I'm not paying any of
that off. So it's not like that's,

226
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,570
it's like a,
imagine if I loved fighting,

227
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:30,070
but all it's doing is doing
bar room barfly street fall.
It fights, you know, like,

228
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,800
and I didn't take Jujitsu classes
and put it to some sort of use.

229
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,010
So that's what I feel like I'm doing
on stage is I'm having a good time and

230
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:38,830
they're amazing shows and
they are one of a kind.

231
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,650
But if I do have a moment
of really good writing,

232
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,640
I'm not then taking it and doing the real
work of sitting in the green room and

233
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:49,930
writing what worked, taping my set. So
I just started taping my sets and going,

234
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,170
all right. But those little tiny
notebooks, I have a hard time,

235
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,300
like they're good for your pocket by have
a hard time getting inspired to write

236
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,180
in it like,
but those big ones I do.

237
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,540
So like I'll write a big letter and
then really right around the letter,

238
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,940
like almost like it's an old school
book from like the, you know,

239
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:07,690
like the 18 hundreds. So that's
what I've been doing. So you,

240
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,790
I use those little books
that go in the pockets.

241
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,640
I use those for just right
before I go on stage notes.

242
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:17,500
Like I write out like set lists and
stuff like that or new ideas that I can't

243
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:20,710
let go. I write them down on
that. But uh, I'm, I'm with you.

244
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:24,550
I write most of my stuff on a computer,

245
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,570
but I like to like write long hand for
memory. Yeah. I just started my eye.

246
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:31,980
It's impossible to write a book, obviously
shorthand, but I found the quick,

247
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:34,900
did his, are you serious?
Longhand? They call it, you know,

248
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:37,150
it's not shortening the
shorthand. Is that weird? Um,

249
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,790
you know that weird you
ever seen shorthand?

250
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,830
Like it's called Gregg Gregg shorthand.

251
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,170
It's like a that they used to
use tonight. Rivers, courts,

252
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,010
demographers and um, no, I don't think
they use a typing. Yeah, you're right.

253
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,130
They have some weird typing method,

254
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,180
but reporters would use it. Yeah. There
was an article about it recently because,

255
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:00,800
um, I always knew about it. I
never understood it, but I, um,

256
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,980
I was reading this article about this
new product that I just picked up.

257
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,710
I still haven't implemented it yet,
but what it is,

258
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:11,711
is a pen that is an MP three recorder
and it also takes photographs of your

259
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:16,400
notes. So say if we were doing this
podcast and I had the piece of paper,

260
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,090
what I would do is you would
say something. I would say,
Oh shit, Xanax on a plane.

261
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,690
And I would write it down like I had an
idea or there was something that we both

262
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,850
said that I knew that I
need to revisit or whatever.

263
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,070
And then if I wanted to go over my notes
afterwards I go to the pen and I can

264
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,071
put the pen over the note and it would
play the recording that was going on as I

265
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:37,400
wrote the note.

266
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,560
Fuck yes. Isn't that
crazy? That's fucking,

267
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,260
oh, that's personally wizard shit, dude.

268
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,450
Let me tell you what exactly what
you know what that's good for. Oh,

269
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,630
that's a good for a lot of shit. I
was trying to think. I'm trying to,

270
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:53,440
I try to remember my dreams,
like a excited,

271
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,320
really fucking insane dreams and I
think that you can find out some,

272
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:01,370
some sort of your subconscious
creativity throughout your dreams.

273
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,060
Yeah. Yeah. I think that
would be, oh well, let's see.

274
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:06,980
The thing about this is that it records,
you know,

275
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,670
the idea is that you're recording an MP.

276
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,840
It's really for like
people doing interviews,

277
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:12,910
like that's one of the best things for it.

278
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,610
But it's like if we were doing
an interview, I'd have a pen,

279
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:18,640
I'd be able to write down what you're
saying or write notes down on what you're

280
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:20,140
saying.
But I would have the entire room

281
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,440
courting who it's not going to,

282
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,250
you can't find your pen and you just
write the tail end and you're hurt and you

283
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,610
heard. And that's how I cured
aids. And you're like, dammit,

284
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,010
I should have written the beginning
of this. Yeah, let me find this thing.

285
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:32,830
Just so everybody knows what
we're all here. It's called,

286
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:37,690
it's called the live scribe sky Wifi pen.
It's very,

287
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:38,620
very interesting.

288
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,930
I just signed up for fucking nature
box while you're doing your ads.

289
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,220
I just bought six months. Those seraching
things and the bluebird thing sold me.

290
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,910
So tell me this one. I'll buy this
one. It's called the live scribe.

291
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,310
Um, and it's, uh, it works
on Wifi. Um, this one,

292
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,110
the one that I got is eight gigabytes
and uh, it's incredible, man.

293
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,330
It's really an amazing invention.

294
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,100
I say this having not used it even once,
but uh,

295
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,700
it has uh,
uh,

296
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,250
very high reviews on online from
reporters and from folks who use that.

297
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,970
My idea is that I'm going
to start using it for, uh,

298
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,700
for podcasts because I have
all these notes like, you know,

299
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:21,960
that are all scribbled in and I go over
them at the end of the week and try to

300
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:25,530
find it. Cause every now and then one
of these will become a bit, you know,

301
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,460
one of these things that I
say is worth, um, like here,

302
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,210
vampires colonizing Mars. Oh, preppers.

303
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,380
I Dunno what the fuck that means. I
have no idea. But if I had the pen,

304
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,340
I could go over that and it would tell
me the exact thing we were talking about.

305
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:43,040
What vampires are colonizing Mars.

306
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,750
If you get a pen or with the David
Tell joke where you get a parrot.

307
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,900
Zody said, I, he goes,
I ain't go. By the way,

308
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,020
here's what I'm done doing.
I'm done.

309
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,290
Idolizing the guys that I
idolized out loud. Like I,

310
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,300
I think Jim Norton is one of my
favorite comics. No world did.

311
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:03,600
Then he came over to my podcast,

312
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,490
I should have just sucked his dick for
an hour because literally I sat there and

313
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,640
I was like, I just posted it today
and it's getting like tons of hits.

314
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,090
But everyone's like one hour,
like, like they were like,

315
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:19,830
you really were blown because I love Opie
and Anthony and I listened to the show

316
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,420
all the time. I love
tough, tough crowd. Right?

317
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,680
And I listened to him on your podcast,
which was fucking amazing.

318
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,420
And then he came over to
my house and I'm like,

319
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,840
can you tell the story that you
told what I felt like a child?

320
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,330
Well, he's, you know, I, I
know what you're talking about.

321
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:37,740
It's hard when you have genuine
admiration or you know, you,

322
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,910
you want to express it,

323
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:42,870
but you're trying to figure out how to
not be like so fan boyish and just get

324
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,770
over it. But that's also part of the
enthusiasm of being not just a comic,

325
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:49,230
but a fan of comedy. You
know, you're a fan of it.

326
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,540
Huge Fan.
I'm more,

327
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:56,250
I would say sometimes I'm more a fan
than a comedian. Like cause I love,

328
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,280
I love laughing,
I love laughing.

329
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,670
I go online and I'll watch
videos fucking all night long.

330
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,990
I watched Patrice has elephant in the
room. I might watch that once a month.

331
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:07,824
No lie.

332
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,860
You know what my favorite joke on
that as man, one of my favorite bits,

333
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,000
I think it's from elephant in the room
when he talks about what position is open

334
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,750
or girls get mad, you know that you know,
I want more out of this relationship.

335
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,150
I want this and things like that.
That position is not open.

336
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,120
And it was like when you go for a job,
you don't say,

337
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,000
I want to be the CEO of a company.
What that position is not open.

338
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,300
The position that's open is I come
over two o'clock in the morning,

339
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:33,540
you suck my Dick, I drink your
last Snapple. That position's open.

340
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,500
It's fucking such a good bit.
My favorite.

341
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,960
It's so like defines and when,

342
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
especially when you're single and you
know every man and woman who has ever been

343
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:49,250
single has those moments where you're
with someone where you like, yeah,

344
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,390
this could go away and I'll be all right.
You know,

345
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,140
like girls need sex just like guys do.
Don't play games.

346
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:58,500
I did to grow who admitted to me
that she was using me for sex. I go,

347
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:02,940
I am cool with that. You know, let's
just, we got it all out in the table.

348
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,370
Let's just use it like that.
But you know,

349
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:10,371
there's people that get into situations
where you feel that way but they want

350
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,300
marriage, they want you to be the number
one and they'll make you feel bad.

351
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,920
Like you're doing something wrong.

352
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:20,370
Like you're a piece of shit because
you don't want what they want.

353
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,360
And then Patrice, the way he like
labeled it out, they're like, no,

354
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:27,980
that position is not available here.
Here's what positions available there.

355
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,833
Tell me if you want.
It

356
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,240
makes that joke genius in my opinion.
And I love those.

357
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:35,700
This is what I loved about Patrice
was the, the truth of it. The,

358
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,020
the fact that that is actually all and
you know it's true because you know he

359
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:43,720
drank her last snap.
That's the best part of that joke

360
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,920
cause a lot of comics would just leave
it as the piston is open ones where you

361
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,220
suck

362
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,700
my dick. Right. Cause you think it would
end big. Right. That's a big hard word.

363
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,230
But the one paid trees Patrice great
was and I drink your last step that adds

364
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:59,790
the flavor. You know it's like the extra
spice in the stew. It's like Dwayne,

365
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,820
he said my favorite joke on that whole
special is a, he's like, oh I like,

366
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:05,560
I didn't know how important
things are going to be.

367
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:08,260
Like I never learned how to type.
And he was like I didn't,

368
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:13,090
I was too busy calling people gay.
We're going to steal lunch.

369
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:14,770
Me Bitch.
And he's like,

370
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:19,110
and now I can't type so I can't talk to
anybody because you don't realize how am

371
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,720
I remember taking typing classes
and going and exactly what he said.

372
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,630
I'm not going to be a secretary
cause that's when we were kids.

373
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,940
If you took typing and you're good at it,
you're like great, you'd be a secretary.

374
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,650
That was it.
That's how will the world was set up.

375
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,720
You didn't realize everyone
would need to learn how to type.

376
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,880
I do not think it's that
hard to learn how to type.

377
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,150
I had no problem wearing a hat, a
type. I didn't take typing in school.

378
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,290
I didn't take it.
I learned how to type.

379
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,370
I learned how to type because I've got
a computer in college and then worked

380
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,570
like,
but it was hard.

381
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,660
Why was picking and poking for
like the first couple of years?

382
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:50,410
Then I got one of those Mavis baking can
typing programs. Do you ever done that?

383
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,170
No. That's awesome. Um, I don't
even know if they still make it,

384
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:55,960
but what it was was essentially
a program you would run,

385
00:21:55,961 --> 00:22:00,100
you'd run it on a CD Rom and it
was a game and it would be like,

386
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,140
it would tell you to press
the r and you press are like,

387
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:05,260
it was like you're racing and like the
are would come up and you'd have to press

388
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:06,100
the od,
the tea would come up,

389
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:08,740
you press the t and you're supposed to
do it all without looking and it shows

390
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:10,540
you on the keyboard where
your finger should go.

391
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,920
And so you just do it and then eventually
you kind of know where the are is,

392
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:18,490
where the t is, your, your fingers
are on the j and the F and you know,

393
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:22,660
you figure it out and you just learn
how to type. And it didn't take long.

394
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,880
I mean I type now really clearly. I
type fast, I don't look at the keyboard.

395
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,440
I type pretty good. Brian
to this day, he's like, oh,

396
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:32,860
can you believe we can tell you without
looking at the keyboard, it's bullshit.

397
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:36,820
I'm like, you've been typing as long as
me, you lazy. Fuck. Just learn at a type.

398
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,820
Like you're saying it.
Like I wish I could breathe underwater.

399
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,260
It's not like hard stuff to do.
I mean I did it.

400
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:47,110
It was not an effort. It
wasn't like, oh my God,

401
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:49,240
I can't believe I'm still
doing this and I can't type.

402
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,620
I can type without looking,

403
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,820
but then I have to go back and make sure
I did the right letters. Really. Like,

404
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,470
cause I, if I start typing I
can do it. I can totally do it.

405
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,200
But then I got to look at it and go,
okay,

406
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,720
you're looking at if you're typing without
looking, you're looking at the words.

407
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,820
No, I meant, I meant
like looking away. Oh.

408
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,400
Like I can type and look at
the page but like I can't,

409
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,180
I can't like type and look away
and then type like I have to look,

410
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,360
I have to be seeing that I'm
writing the right letters. Yeah, I,

411
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,380
well I definitely think I don't,

412
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,270
I have typed like having a conversation
with someone and it'd be okay. But yeah,

413
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:22,020
you want to look like at the
actual screen as you're typing.

414
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,050
What I mean is like looking down at
the keyboard, hunting and pecking and

415
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,820
I had a disastrous situation
once with this guy.

416
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,360
I got paired up with a head of development
deer and they paired me up with this

417
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:39,070
guide or to write a script and uh, there's
a lot of things wrong with this dude.

418
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,010
He was going to full blown panic
attacks when we have meetings.

419
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,560
I mean full blown panic
attacks where he couldn't talk.

420
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,250
He had these crazy anxiety

421
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,310
attacks. Um, and uh,

422
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,140
the other thing was he couldn't type and
I couldn't believe it. I'm like, you're,

423
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:54,170
you're a professional writer and you
can't type. And he's like, well, you know,

424
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:56,570
writing is about creativity. I go,
it's about putting me in a little,

425
00:23:56,571 --> 00:24:01,400
put it down on paper while you're still
thinking about it. Yeah. Like he couldn't,

426
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,180
I mean it was the war.
It was like he just started typing today.

427
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,530
It wasn't just like he was bad at pecking
a poking cause hunters Thompson picked

428
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,840
and poked the day he died.
But he would, you know,

429
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:15,680
he had this thing where he would do it
and you know he figured out how to write

430
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,630
books by pecking and poking.
It means,

431
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:20,280
it's funny if you ever seen video
of hunter s Thompson typing. No,

432
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:21,600
but I feel like I have Jamie.
Thanks.

433
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:24,440
See if he can find a video
of hunters Thompson typing
cause it was kind of funny.

434
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:28,100
He would just get these two index
fingers and just charging. He had this,

435
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,360
it's kind of spastic thing. You would
do his arms up in the air and it was,

436
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:32,140
it was really intense.

437
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,200
I could probably lose three fingers and
still type cause I think I only use like

438
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,670
this one and my two thumbs,
my two pointers and like one up here.

439
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:41,890
I don't think I use all things.
I don't use pinkies.

440
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,100
I use all of them. Really? Yeah. You get
that typing program man, you should do it.

441
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,740
It'll help you a lot.
It'll definitely make you type quicker.

442
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,170
I know they have some typing programs.

443
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:53,530
I don't know if they still have
the Mavis Bacon, but that's what I,

444
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,640
I need to learn how to read out loud.
But

445
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,260
this is a mother fucker was packing
and Pocan and um, he also would,

446
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,500
would have the, I mean I got it from
fear and loading. Oh, there. Okay.

447
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,100
Well this is sort of a,
an imitation of it by Johnny Depp.

448
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,680
This is sort of like how he would type
and this is Johnny Depp doing it in five

449
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,523
years.

450
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,260
It's him playing liner as Thompson.

451
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,640
You'd probably pull this down and then
we're going to get fucking pulled off of

452
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:24,990
youtube anyway.
Probably already pulled that one off.

453
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,730
We were wanting money from you. You've
referenced something in pop culture. Um,

454
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,670
but this dude was a professional writer,
couldn't write and would go.

455
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:36,620
He's a pitch meeting guy.
It's supposed to be a pitch of any guy.

456
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,420
Full panic attacks. I mean, panic
attack. So we'll have the, uh,

457
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,020
the, uh, the Paul of the plot,
the politic apologize. You know,

458
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,290
Joe's a guy who was all working
in this one applies and,

459
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,500
and I'd be looking at him like, oh, Jesus.

460
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,260
And I didn't want to interrupt
and break in because he's also,

461
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,620
it's very awkward when you're there and
someone's talking about you like your

462
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:01,160
qualities, like what's good about
you. But I'm like, this is pointless.

463
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:04,190
This is a way this meeting is
done. It's over. It's over.

464
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:05,390
As soon as you start stammering,

465
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,840
they're not going to give you a show
to run you fucking stammering. Fuck,

466
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,680
I can't you shit together.
Take a meditation class or something.

467
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:12,530
I'm going to breathe.

468
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,240
He also used to do warm up when he
was a comic quit comedy. Couldn't,

469
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,290
couldn't handle the comment anymore,

470
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,830
but it had like this weird bitterness
towards other comedians. It was very odd.

471
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,150
But he told me that he was in the
middle of a warmup once for a, well,

472
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,890
let's just not say the name of the guy
he was warming up for because we might've

473
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,390
already told this story and
giving up the information,

474
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,820
but just in case I don't want
his name to get out there. Yeah.

475
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,300
He would work for this.
A big name guy,

476
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,360
a Sit-com guy who just
happened to be black. And um,

477
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,040
as he was warming up the crowd,

478
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,730
he had this panic attack
where he got it in his head.

479
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,050
Yup. Did I tell you this? Nope.

480
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,260
I heard it on the podcast and I ha I
listened to your podcast walking through

481
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:57,261
New York and you told a story and I'm
walking to a presentation of corporate

482
00:26:57,271 --> 00:27:01,770
presentation where I am the host and
I literally went, you mother fucker.

483
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,510
And all my brain said was
giggling. Yeah. What the guy said

484
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,500
his, he got this idea in
his head, don't say nigger

485
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,890
for no reason,

486
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,390
but like when folks have anxiety issues
or when folks have mental issues that,

487
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:24,630
that, that, that can happen. You can get
a hitch like, uh, like for whatever it is.

488
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:27,510
It good news.
It can just get stuck in your head.

489
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,770
And for him he couldn't talk and he
was doing this warm up and he was just,

490
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,070
when it was over, he was just
a shaking, sweating mess.

491
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:40,071
And it was just a a wrestling match to
not say nigger while he was warming up a

492
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:41,994
sitcom.

493
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,370
Basket ball get that'll,
I think that'll work for anyone.

494
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,980
And you get that in your head and
when you have to do a president,

495
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,860
I wouldn't let it in. You don't let it
did not about God about it. Thank God.

496
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,500
But I'm walking in and I've heard you
say that and I, when mother Fucker,

497
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,240
I don't worry that it could get you,
it's a brain thing.

498
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,930
I can think myself into an anxiety
attack. Can you really? Yeah,

499
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:10,410
I fall. I've thought myself into big ones.
So what is an anxiety attack exactly?

500
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:13,650
Like what is the feeling like the
first time I ever had when I was white,

501
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,720
it was a kid. I was like,
probably someone will say,

502
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,070
well I was definitely 10 years old.

503
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,610
I was probably 12 and I was watching
Johnny Carson and all I could feel like,

504
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:23,640
was it? He was shouting at me
and his head was real tiny,

505
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:27,920
like the like from beetle juice. His head
was tiny and he was just shouting. Yeah.

506
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,470
And I was like, I was like freaking out
and I went to my dad's room. I was like,

507
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,770
I can't, I think I'm going to die. And
he was, my dad said go back to bed.

508
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,060
And I was like,
okay great,

509
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:39,470
I'll just white knuckle this night
and then fucking and so then I and I,

510
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,440
but I didn't know what it was.

511
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,500
And then the next time I had one where
I realized I realized one day I will die

512
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,650
and I went, what? Like it got real heavy,
everything seems real clear. And then not,

513
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,530
you start spiraling, you get
like a blinders on, it's heels,

514
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,070
you've got blinders on and everything
kind of gets tunnel vision and you lose

515
00:28:56,071 --> 00:29:00,210
kind of like everything feels like
uneasy and you can feel your heart race.

516
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:01,980
I mean it happens
differently for every person,

517
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,490
but I've kind of struggled with them a
little bit and I would get them on planes.

518
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,020
That's why I started drinking on planes.

519
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,540
But I can think myself into a panic
attack. Like last time I was here, I was,

520
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,360
I was going through one cause remember
I was like I have a pain in my side.

521
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,650
That was a panic attack. No, no,

522
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:19,110
but it was one that had been building
throughout the time and I was like

523
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,230
motherfucker where you just start thinking
about it and then you lay in bed at

524
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:25,380
night and your head,
you have no control of your thoughts.

525
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,390
How much exercise do you do? A lot right
now. A lot. Right now. A lot. I'm running,

526
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:33,040
I'm doing, I told you I
had got battle ropes. Um,

527
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,390
yeah I should have googled you before I
started using them by just tried to just

528
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,260
fucking nuts without them attached to
anything and I just basically bullet in

529
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:42,100
the head with a fucking

530
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,870
40 pound road. I held on to
both like, like I was out
running a stage coach. Okay.

531
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,871
Joe and just went and the rope just came
and my daughter's watching and the rope

532
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:54,730
came back and I just
turned it last minute,

533
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,920
hit me in the side of the head and I
hit the ground. And you were just like,

534
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,130
are you okay? And then, um, as I'm
laying on the ground, I'm like,

535
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,240
motherfucker and George,
he goes,

536
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,020
I don't think that's how you're supposed
to use them. I was like, yeah, I know.

537
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,170
It's why I texted you. And you're
like, put them onto a kettle bells.

538
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:11,640
Like should have texted
you before I started doing
dumbbell or you can wrap them

539
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,270
around a tree.
Even I put them on,

540
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,400
I put them on a Kettlebell and then
to put them on my grass and you know,

541
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:19,840
helps me loosen up. I have a bad
back and it helps loosen up my back.

542
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,590
I had an anxiety attack one weekend I
was in Syracuse and I listened to Bas

543
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,020
Rutten one about his arm and I started,
I started figuring,

544
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,190
cause I've had this back problem from
riding rollercoasters I was like,

545
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:33,190
what if I get that sound? And you
know, you've got a fucked up job, dude.

546
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,840
Your job is, I mean you've taken
so many people on roller coasters,

547
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,830
the other bed back, put your
hands up. That's so crazy.

548
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:44,550
It doesn't even make sense.
Like you might be the only guy ever.

549
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,860
He has a fucked up back
from riding roller coasters.

550
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,950
You start spiraling and you're like get
tendonitis in your elbow and you're like,

551
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:52,390
mother fucker.
I was like,

552
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,850
and then I ran into do that like
next week and I was like, Joe,

553
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,100
talk to me about back issues.
And you were like,

554
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,650
but like some people are prone to anxiety.

555
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,630
I think it has to do a lot with your diet.

556
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,410
That has to do a lot with your exercise.
Like when I'm not exercising,

557
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,850
I'm fucking gone.

558
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,160
I have a theory that the body is in
some ways like a magnet for energy.

559
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,900
It stores up energy and if you
don't push that energy out,

560
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,020
it starts freaking out. It doesn't
know what, at least my body. I mean my,

561
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,640
my only theories based on my personal
experiences and the way my body works is

562
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:29,590
if I don't exert energy in a
very powerful way, like um,

563
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,230
like a hard cardio,
like hard lifting,

564
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:35,620
running hills or something like that
where I like really blow it out.

565
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:40,210
If I don't do that several days a week,
I get these moments where I,

566
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,400
I know that like my body
wants to do something and it
wants to like overreact to

567
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:49,240
things, you know? And I feel like
that's what a lot of people say. Like,

568
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,410
oh that guy's got a bad temper.

569
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,910
I guarantee you a lot of what people
have is just, we call it a bad temper,

570
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:59,230
but a lot of his poor management of your
energy resources and that you haven't

571
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:04,231
blown out that energy and sort of this
way where your body is at an event.

572
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:09,190
It's not cause otherwise your body kind
of overflows with this excess stress,

573
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,310
anxiety or stress or energy.
And if you,

574
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,780
I forced myself just like I forced
myself to brush my teeth. I enjoy it.

575
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:20,290
I enjoy working out, but it's a, it's
an, I'm not getting away from it.

576
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,640
I have to do it because I don't
necessarily, I don't like,

577
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,430
it's not that I don't like
me when I'm not exercising,

578
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,090
but I don't like me as much
and I create more problems.

579
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,250
I create more problems
in my personal life.

580
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,190
I create more problems with
how I relate to people.

581
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,160
I create more problems when I'm,
when I'm just stressed and I've always

582
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,980
had this thing where I would
go long periods of time,

583
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:45,860
like I'll go a week without working
out just because I'm too fucking busy.

584
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:50,360
I can't do it, but I don't accept that
anymore. I've, over the last few years,

585
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,770
especially this last year,

586
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,800
I completely s that's now no longer
an option because I'm not at my best.

587
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm not at my best as a human being.
I'm not at my best as a dad.

588
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:04,700
I'm not at my best as a father
or as a husband, rather.

589
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,140
I'm not at my best as a podcast or I'm
not at my best as a comedian and it can

590
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:12,920
be fixed. It's like something that can
be, it's not like I wish I could fly like,

591
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:17,570
no, I can work out. I can just, I can
just do it, you know? So I forced myself.

592
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:21,920
Now I get 100% absolutely. There's not a
week that goes by that I don't work out.

593
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,090
I make sure I get it in.

594
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,040
I just read a really interesting
article about sleep and there were,

595
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,950
it was a sleep study and they were saying
that they had put a bunch of people

596
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:31,760
that they'd done the test group of like
over like four weeks and they did a

597
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:35,460
group at at six hours a group at uh,
seven,

598
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,620
four hours in a group of eight hours.

599
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,680
And they found that like
if you slept eight hours,

600
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,910
you were exponentially, uh, more active.

601
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:48,330
And then they were saying there that
that's why Lebron James Sleeps like 11

602
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:49,164
hours at night.

603
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,210
Cause Cause I've had plantar fasciitis
with the feet so I had to like slow down

604
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:56,640
my running and I noticed
that I was getting like,

605
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,250
I was drinking more because I was
depressed because it was like this spiral.

606
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:05,010
And then one night I just,
I just didn't drink and I slept solid.

607
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:09,960
Like I slept like nine hours and my
feet felt good in the morning and I went

608
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,890
whoa,
I wonder if it,

609
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:13,950
and then I read this article and it says
that your body can't repair itself if

610
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,910
it doesn't get into the SMP,
sleep or something. Not the rem,

611
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:22,590
but the deep like lower your blood
pressure, lower your body temperature,

612
00:34:22,591 --> 00:34:24,540
like get yourself out.

613
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,500
That's when the body starts repairing
itself and like you get sicker easily.

614
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,920
And I was like, so when I'm on the road
I'm doing these like quick turnarounds,

615
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:34,320
you do it late show Friday,
Thursday night and then you got,

616
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,440
or to show stores that it's Friday
night and you got press or whatever and

617
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:40,590
you're getting like six hours
sleep. You're not letting
your body repair itself.

618
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:42,600
So that's why your plantar
fasciitis comes in.

619
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,610
All these ailments that people have now,

620
00:34:44,611 --> 00:34:47,160
it's like they got elements where it's
like nerve diseases where everyone was

621
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:49,590
just like, like just pain with, I
don't, I forget what it's called,

622
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:51,840
but I saw a commercial
on it and as I was like,

623
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,480
I guarantee you it's a lot of it has
to do with sleep. You're totally right.

624
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,800
Right.
Absolutely.

625
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:59,670
I noticed a big difference between also
sleeping all those hours in a row. Like,

626
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:00,510
sometimes I'll have to,

627
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,270
I'll have to do something early in the
morning and I'll get like four hours

628
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:05,430
sleep and then I'll take
a nap in the afternoon.

629
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:08,130
But it's not the same nurse still
backed up. It's not the same.

630
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,870
And you can't, you can't
recatch that deficit. There's,

631
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,260
that's the other thing they're saying
is that you can't like make up sleep.

632
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:17,680
So once you get it, you just missed it.
You just, it's done. It's gone forever.

633
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,470
It's like Kaiser San Jose. Well you can
get it, but you'd have to do, you know,

634
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:21,940
like they say it's like half time.

635
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:24,550
So like if you know you've missed
four hours sleep the night before,

636
00:35:24,551 --> 00:35:27,030
he need an extra to the next nine
or something like that. Yeah.

637
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,100
But you sleep is a huge

638
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,770
essential. Tito Ortiz, when he was a
champion to sleep 12 hours a day. Yeah,

639
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:35,510
he's to toy. He's training
so much. You know,

640
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:39,300
he would go to bed and go to bed at
like midnight and wake up at noon.

641
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,260
Just sleep. God, yeah, we need it. You
need to recover. My kids sleep 12 hours

642
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,600
day. My kids sleep late. My
kids are like stoners now. Yeah.

643
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,360
They like wake up at like 1130 and they're
like, oh the fuck, what are we eating?

644
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,460
Well, it's summer right now, you know,
summertime for kids. It's fucking awesome.

645
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,310
I said to me that the night I'm putting,
I lose my like little loose cannon. She,

646
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,520
I'm putting her to bed. She goes,
can I talk to you for a second? Go.

647
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,650
She's like eight, eight this
weekend. Eight year old goes,

648
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:08,860
can I talk to you for a second? It's
such a weird moment. I go, yeah,

649
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:09,694
she was getting bad.

650
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,670
So I get in bed next to her and she
like posts up on her elbow and she goes,

651
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,590
right. Do you believe in time
travel? Whoa. And I'm like,

652
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,760
it's fucking real.

653
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,690
She came back from the future and talk
to herself and now she's got to clear it

654
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:24,310
with me. That's where
my brain's at. I'm like,

655
00:36:24,311 --> 00:36:28,390
this is a great beginning to a great
movie. And so, so I was like, I do.

656
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:32,320
And she goes, do you think I could
come back to this time right now?

657
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,450
And I was like, what do
you mean? She's like,

658
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:36,850
if I go into the future and
make a time travel machine,

659
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:40,600
could I come back to here? I go, yeah.
She goes, what? I'd be this age. I go, no,

660
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:44,800
you'd be older. She goes, oh,
okay. That's it. And I was like,

661
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,990
what the fuck?
I wanted to get more into her head,

662
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:48,930
but you don't want to like
start picking it apart. So I go,

663
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:51,890
go to bed and I'm going ahead. I'm like,
I'm going out to the fucking man cave.

664
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:54,190
I'm pouring a cocktail and I'm fucking,
I was like,

665
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:56,740
that's because I'm
obsessed with time travel.

666
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,250
So that gives you an excuse to
pour a cocktail, start screaming.

667
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,220
You need start dreaming, man. A cocktail
is what you need to start dreaming.

668
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,850
I start when I, when I have a cocktail,
that first drink, it's like you're,

669
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:11,080
it's like a, it's like, it gets, it's
gets the juices going. You're like this.

670
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:14,100
Is that Ernest Hemingway moment,
the Ernest Hemingway? You,

671
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,920
do you really believe in time
travel? I do. In what way? Uh,

672
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,270
I believe that I believe
in a couple of things.

673
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,990
I believe that there are
parallel universes and all
over the planet and that you

674
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,100
can jump back and forth from those
parallel universes based on, um,

675
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,940
like I read this thing and I, and I'm
doing a poor example of explaining it,

676
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,510
but I believe there are
universities that I have died in,

677
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,580
but this is the one that
I'm living in right now.

678
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,190
And I think there will be times right,
die in this inner universe,

679
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,340
but I'll hop over other ones.
Does that make sense?

680
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,570
Should we just light a joint right
now? Yeah, I think you might have to.

681
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,970
I think this like what,
where is this coming from?

682
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,510
Like is one thing to have like a theory
like that could be possible and it

683
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:57,490
certainly could be. I mean just the
universe itself, it's so bizarre. Yeah.

684
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,440
There are hundreds of billions
of planets in this galaxy.

685
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:03,920
This is one of hundreds of billions of
galaxies in the known universe that this

686
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:08,090
universe might be a part of an infinite
number of universes because each black

687
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:11,810
hole has one half of 1%
of the mass of the galaxy.

688
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:12,920
It's a supermassive black hole,

689
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:15,170
and they believe that inside that
black hole is another universe.

690
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,230
That's where your time traveling
in those black holes could,

691
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,140
I just saw something online about it,
but I'm obsessed.

692
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,760
I'd like if you've seen time traveler's
wife. No. If I tell you about it,

693
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,880
I'll start crying. It's the greatest
movie ever. Does it like old yeller?

694
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,440
Because I cry when I see, oh yeller, it's
better. It's better as a comic is best.

695
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,520
I talked to Duncan about it one time
and he cried, but Dunkin but Dunkin,

696
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:37,241
so Dunkin,

697
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:40,960
like you can't bring half a subject to
Dunkin because he knows the rest of it.

698
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:44,630
He'll fill it up with Satan and he, I
go, it's the greatest movie in all rape.

699
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,760
He goes, you saw, you know Dunkin?
Yeah. Fallah movie. I go, yeah. He goes,

700
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,830
does he suck his own
Dick? Oh. And he goes,

701
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,750
then it's different than the book.
You read the book? He goes, yeah.

702
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,910
He goes back in time and teaches
himself to jack off. He does. It's like,

703
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:06,390
are you serious? And
don't get it. Like, yeah.

704
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,090
So he goes back in time and talks
to himself about jerking off.

705
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,700
Teaches himself how to it. I haven't
read the book or You saw the movie?

706
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,980
I don't know. We've got
a cold Tonkin. Oh God.

707
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,990
So he goes back in time
and sucks is on deck.

708
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,860
I Guess Duncan's one that gave me this
information that's not unnecessary.

709
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,400
I mean, Jesus Christ, all the shit
you can do if you had a time machine,

710
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,190
I'm going come back at Tom. Suck my
own dick. What really? How about yeah,

711
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,880
how about see a dinosaur? That's
what everybody would do. Right.

712
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,870
Um,
when you say

713
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,800
like that you believe in time travel,

714
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,350
do you think that time travel
is happening right now?

715
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:42,500
Do you believe that there is,

716
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,570
it's possible that someone could come
here right now and they could be from the

717
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:47,180
future?

718
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,020
I hope so. I hope so. I
believe that when you die,

719
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:55,100
you time travel for everyone else.
Like I think you keep living.

720
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,010
I don't believe in death. I believe
you keep living. Why do you think that?

721
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,080
Because I don't want to die.
I'm so obsessed with not
dying, but why do you see,

722
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,140
my thought is always that this life that
we've looked at from the moment we were

723
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:12,320
born, the breathing in and breathing
out the water in the ocean,

724
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:17,000
the trees that we've just come to accept
this as the only reality and that it's

725
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:22,001
very possible that whatever happens
when you die is just a spectacular but

726
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:27,380
completely different in
some in an unimaginable way.

727
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,330
And I get this from
psychedelic experiences that
I've had that seems so real,

728
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:36,440
but they're so different from anything
that you see in this life that it made me

729
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:40,490
reconsider this idea of what? What is
like the material life that we live?

730
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:44,570
What does this material world and is
this material world the only possibility

731
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,880
for an existence?
And I don't think it is.

732
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:51,881
I think this is just one possibility
out of an infinite number of potential

733
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:55,130
possibilities of how life could be.

734
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,700
I think this is just the life that we're
in right now. This is what life is,

735
00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:03,370
but the idea of living this kind
of life over and over again, um,

736
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,650
I wouldn't say it's not appealing
because I love life. I have,

737
00:41:06,651 --> 00:41:09,140
I'm having a great time.
I really enjoy it.

738
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,350
Some people get annoyed at you when you
say that because they haven't figured

739
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:13,720
life out or they don't.
I'm not,

740
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,760
not that I'm some sort of a master
in life that I've figured it out.

741
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:17,594
I'm better than you.

742
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:22,130
But what I'm saying is I figured out a
way to live a life that is very enjoyable

743
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:25,250
for me. I enjoy it and I enjoy
it because of a lot of things.

744
00:41:25,251 --> 00:41:26,810
I enjoy it because I have great friends.

745
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,300
I enjoy it because I love
what I do for a living.

746
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:34,190
I enjoy it because I love my family.
I enjoy it because I, I just,

747
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:34,790
I just,

748
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,790
I have a passion for learning things and
I have a passion for just experiencing

749
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:42,290
things. There's so much to live
and experience in this life.

750
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,710
I'm enjoying the fuck out of it.
And the idea of this,

751
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,580
like one of the most terrifying things
for people is the idea of reincarnation

752
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,620
and not just the idea of death,

753
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,790
but the idea that you live the same life
over and over again. Well, I take it,

754
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,940
I have this again, I like this
slide. This life is great.

755
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:03,941
I wouldn't like age one
through 15 was rough,

756
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,450
really from 15 on things
started getting a lot better,

757
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,070
but still it's still,
it's still like anxiety filled,

758
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,650
fucking crazy disaster.
Well,

759
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:20,000
I mean I probably was deep
into my thirties before I
realized how to calm down

760
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,380
and actually enjoy life and not
just be like running on ice,

761
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,980
like hoping I don't fall, you know,
just wow, like barely been control,

762
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:31,790
but moving some album.
That's how I always felt.

763
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,000
And now I feel like I'm on solid
ground and I'm moving forward.

764
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:38,660
It's still completely unpredictable
and it's still, you know,

765
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,290
largely out of your control,
but the things that you can control,

766
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:44,960
you kind of understand those things.
But for a lot of people,

767
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:48,230
the idea of living this whole
life over and over and over again,

768
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:50,360
it's terrifying that it's pointless.

769
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,910
Oh, I told my dad the other day, I have,

770
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,570
I went through some drama back home with
friends where a friend passed and it

771
00:42:57,571 --> 00:43:01,740
was really fucking hard. And my dad was
talking about death a lot and I was,

772
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:04,620
I got real surreal and I was like,
you know, I don't think, I mean like,

773
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:07,710
I think people would be sad at my funeral
by guarantee you a lot of people would

774
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,220
be like,
he did a lot more than we expected

775
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:15,150
with the minimum amount of
tools that God gave him.

776
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:19,710
He really milked the fuck out of
whatever bullshit he had. That's funny.

777
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,140
That's funny. Cause I want people to be
sad, but I want people to also go. I get,

778
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,870
you know who said it? I just
heard it, so, oh God damn it.

779
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,740
It was fucking Hixon Gracie. I was
listening to the podcast today. Yeah,

780
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,500
I'm about to quote Hicks.
He was here fuck.

781
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,360
Sitting in the seat an
hour ago and he said,

782
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,700
you feel like you're absorbing
his energy from that seat. Dude,

783
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:41,090
I saw the documentary choke.
He's a bad motherfucker.

784
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,150
Bad Ass fucking documentary
hits. Um, I in the,

785
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,930
and what really got me into Hickson was
cron cause I listened to the podcast

786
00:43:48,931 --> 00:43:50,430
with Chron and he seemed very grounded.

787
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:54,060
He seemed very real going back to
the valley Tudo and he was like,

788
00:43:54,061 --> 00:43:55,290
I'm going to do it.
And you just like,

789
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:58,140
and I didn't even know what that
was at the time I was there.

790
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,790
That's a really fascinating family.

791
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,650
I'd like to see a movie made
about their grandfather.

792
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,040
Oh yeah. Yeah. This Guy
Leo on my tee shirt,

793
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,790
he's, you know, his, his story stories.

794
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:11,780
Like he jumped in an ocean and rescue
people from sharks. I hung out.

795
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:12,521
Why? I told you about, you know,

796
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:15,330
I hung out with Horian that day and
Horian talked to about his grandpa,

797
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,340
his father,
a bunch like he challenged,

798
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:23,380
he got sent to jail and them came out of
the steps in Rio de Janeiro out of the

799
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,910
courthouse and challenge the guide the
guy's brother to a fight at the court

800
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:32,730
steps like this is like 1930 this
is just fucking, Rio de Janeiro

801
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,290
was insane and I've been to Rio.

802
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:39,060
So now you have like the real scope of
it and you meet Brazilians and all his

803
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:41,850
stories are so much better because the
way he says them with able to a zillion

804
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:45,330
accident and I put you in the grave, I
put you in the ditch. That's how it goes.

805
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,390
If you don't like it, cause these
guys don't know. Jews use it too.

806
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,300
I mean it's so fucking, it
was a great pocket. You know,

807
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:55,150
he had a philosophy on life.
Leo did a very specific philosophy.

808
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,350
He believed that you live this
life and if you do anything wrong,

809
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,920
if you do anything the wrong way,
you live the life over again.

810
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,700
You have to come back and do it
again. That was his thought. He did.

811
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:08,930
He said that Albert Brooks
Movie Groundhog Day. No,

812
00:45:08,931 --> 00:45:13,140
no though heaven where Brooks goes to
heaven and every time they show him all

813
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:17,440
his mistakes in life. Do you ever saw
that? No, I don't think you did. Yeah,

814
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:21,420
that's not fucking whatever. Don't put up.
Um, don't pull it up. Don't pull it up.

815
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,300
It's all fucking bullshit.
Don't fucking pull it up.
Jamie. Jesus Christ. Jamie. Um,

816
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,220
but the, the idea behind that is scary
to a lot of people. You know that you,

817
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,660
you have to like,
when life presents you a scenario,

818
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:36,750
you have to pick the correct answer.
You have to do the correct thing,

819
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,020
have the correct behavior. That
was his thought. I this one of the,

820
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:44,010
one of the first times I ever actively
considered that possibility was reading

821
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:46,050
an interview with him where he
was talking about lists and he,

822
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,930
the way he says it,
he was an older man

823
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,030
and he was saying it in Portuguese and
they were translating it in English,

824
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:57,420
but he was saying that,
you know you, this is like,

825
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:01,770
he wasn't saying it like I think
maybe it could be possibly now.

826
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:06,480
He was just stating it as a fact that
you will live this life over and over

827
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:10,920
again until you get it right.
What a tough place to grow up in Brazil.

828
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,500
He was just this unbelievable stud.

829
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,210
I'm just an incredible bad motherfucker
and not like a physically imposing man.

830
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,690
He was 130 540 pounds,
small guy,

831
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,720
like maybe one 47 like at his heaviest.

832
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,260
He wasn't big by any stretch of the
imagination. It wasn't physically strong,

833
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,770
wasn't some kind of freak athlete,
wasn't particularly flexible,

834
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,900
just smart as fuck. Toughest Shit.
Just figured out how to, first of all,

835
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,560
never had sex unless it was
for procreation. Came in,

836
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:45,060
every girl he ever had sex with, he had
like 19 kids and I'm not bullshitting.

837
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,810
He had a ton of kids and
all of them killers. He, me,

838
00:46:49,811 --> 00:46:54,811
he raised the greatest fighters the
martial arts world has ever known.

839
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,490
If you want to talk about a family,

840
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,430
there's never been a family that
can fuck with the grace. He's,

841
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:01,470
it's not even a close second.
It's like,

842
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,750
what's the greatest martial arts
family of all time? The Gracies,

843
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,490
everybody would say that.
And it's directly, the
shamrock has tried to do that.

844
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:11,940
Right? Well, they tried to name all
the kids they adopted shamrock. Yeah.

845
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:14,790
But that's, you know, that's,
that's the take on it. First of all,

846
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,410
it's that Bob Shamrock was a,

847
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:22,690
just a great guy who took in a lot of
kids that had troubled pasts and he would

848
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:27,270
take a lot of them in when
they were in their 19, 18,
20, you know, and adopt them.

849
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,980
You know, we take them as they were
older, they were already troubled

850
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,090
kids like frank shamrock, um, went
into great depth about it. Like,

851
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,810
you know who he's really troubled and
had all sorts of legal problems and

852
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:38,501
everything.
When,

853
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:42,480
when Bob took him in and he changed
his name to shamrock and then, uh,

854
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,970
Ken Shamrock, of course, same
thing, you know, so Bob Shamrock,

855
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:47,310
the guy who did that was just a,

856
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:52,000
a really great guy who taught those
young men how to be a man. You know,

857
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,730
that's important. Oh, without
a doubt. Hugely a fort,

858
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,640
but very different than what Leo did.

859
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,880
Leo just made an army with his dick.

860
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,740
He like created an army, like all
these people that were born out of his,

861
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,000
his procreation, they became these
killers. He's killer fighters.

862
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,040
And he was basically starting a franchise.
His Dna,

863
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,850
he started at Jujitsu franchise like
Robert Hartman did with the Improv.

864
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,050
In a way that's almost impossible
to replicate today unless you,

865
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:22,480
they fucking sociopath.
I mean,

866
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,650
you could kind of only do this and
in 1940 just shoot loads and checks.

867
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:29,950
And he was the Johnny Appleseed
of Fugitsu by just sweet.

868
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,740
Now does hoists and Horian and Hickson
had the same moms? That's a good question.

869
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,400
Some of them do not.
Have the same moms.

870
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:39,910
I do not believe that hoists
and Hicks and have the same mom.

871
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,310
I think they have different moms. There's
a bunch of moms in the picture and he,

872
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,580
I would love to grab a book,
just married, not married.

873
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:52,350
I don't know what you're talking
about. I'm fucking, I'm fucking,

874
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,390
I'm making babies. And his,
his thing is like, you know,

875
00:48:55,391 --> 00:49:00,390
he would talk about it every time I would
have sex is for procreation. Like he,

876
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:02,260
he wasn't having recreational sex.

877
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:06,310
He was trying to make babies
different story maybe.

878
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,570
But he was such a gangster man.
He was so interesting.

879
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,310
I had a Steve Maxwell on the podcast
before and Steve Maxwell when he was,

880
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:17,980
uh, before he was even a Blackbaud,
I believe he's a brown belt.

881
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,790
He was a training with
hoists and he went to stay,

882
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:26,770
stayed for a couple months at Elios
farm in Brazil. And Leo would,

883
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:27,431
uh,
you know,

884
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:31,390
he had cows and goats and he would milk
the goats and they would make cheese

885
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:35,710
with the, with the goat milk. It
was all raw, unpasteurized cheese.

886
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,030
He would grow his own vegetables.

887
00:49:37,031 --> 00:49:41,590
He had like a way of living that was
like really like close to nature.

888
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:43,600
Like he didn't believe in preservatives.

889
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:48,601
He didn't believe in
antibiotics for animals and
like everything that he ate was

890
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:53,410
like stuff that he grew and did
everything like in a very natural way.

891
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,760
Fascinating. It makes you feel like a
bitch and you hear about a guy like that.

892
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:01,150
He's just the guy just,
I mean I'm still jacking off.

893
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:03,970
Think about all the Times you've
pulled out your life. How about him?

894
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:09,030
Never just fucking roaring into
the abyss with his calm far

895
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,640
more babies. Bring them to me. I will
raise them and turn them into an army.

896
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,540
I, I'm impressed by the challenging
people like the Hixson does.

897
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,480
Like they challenged people to a
fight and they go, I challenge you to,

898
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:25,510
if I haven't challenged anybody to shit,
well that's probably good.

899
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:27,800
In this day and age it doesn't
really work. It's like,

900
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,110
you know, challenge someone to erase and
all that's invented as bicycles, right?

901
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,990
Today they have a thing called cars
are going to lose it. Fucking race.

902
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,840
Volume was a bike. I'm going to race
you and the guy blows by you on a car.

903
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,720
Like you challenge people to fights
and they're gonna fucking stab you.

904
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,510
Someone's going to shoot you. It's not,
it's a different world that we live in.

905
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:46,460
I mean it was a different
world in Hickson's time.

906
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,120
You heard the stories that he was telling
about people showing up to fights with

907
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:53,900
guns and knives and shit.
But I think what Leo was doing,

908
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:58,850
W it was such a wild time like
living in Brazil at that time,

909
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,040
completely different era,
you know,

910
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:05,930
completely different time as far as
martial arts too. It was almost unknown.

911
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,980
Like the, the, the,

912
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:11,180
the reality of martial arts at
that time was essentially Asian.

913
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:16,190
It was all Asian influenced.
It was Japanese, it was
karate and it was Kung Fu.

914
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:17,040
And then there was,
uh,

915
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,480
India had some wrestling and then there's
Iran had wrestling. There was some, uh,

916
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,420
different cultures that
had grappling arts.

917
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:25,490
But essentially all of
it was coming from Asia.

918
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:29,450
There was nothing in South America,
there was nothing in a, in North America,

919
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,320
there was boxing, you know, people had
to hand techniques. And some wrestling,

920
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,640
but the,

921
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:39,641
what they had started and what his family
had started was a revolution changed

922
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:44,420
martial arts from that seed,
the seed that was planted by my Ada,

923
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:49,040
by this, uh, this guy that had
come to, um, to Japan to teach,

924
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:53,110
he came from, uh, from
Japan to Brazil to teach he,

925
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,140
he planted seeds and these Brazilian
people that spread across the entire world

926
00:51:57,141 --> 00:52:00,120
within a hundred years,
I mean less than 100 years later,

927
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,610
martial arts have evolved
more substantially than they
have in the last thousand.

928
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,230
It's really the last 20 years from the
time Americans found out about it from 93

929
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,620
on from 93 on is that
when Jujitsu showed up,

930
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,470
that's when Jujitsu showed up in the form
of the ultimate fighting championship.

931
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:17,480
That's when we saw funny hoists,
Gracie,

932
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:20,120
because we were taking a long
time for it to take root.

933
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:24,450
Mike Larosa was like group one of my
friends who is from Saudi Arabia like you,

934
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:26,130
but he grew up in Saudi Arabia,

935
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:28,380
but it's that I think worked for
coke or something or you know,

936
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,050
he had a job over there and he came
back to the states and he was in eighth

937
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:32,970
grade and I met him in like seventh grade,
eighth grade.

938
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,070
And he would learn Jujitsu
in Saudi Arabia. Whoa.

939
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,790
And he was talking about Jujitsu and I
remember that's the first time I ever

940
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:42,330
heard about it. So not your Rabia. Wow.
Yeah. I wish I can get in touch with him.

941
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,700
Callen grew up overseas like that.
You know,

942
00:52:44,701 --> 00:52:48,480
my cousin hung out with you the
other night. My fucking cousin.

943
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:53,010
Because your cousin, big tall kid.
Like with like a ginger hair. You,

944
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,520
you hung out with you and cal. He's
friends with Callan. Andrew Hobson.

945
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,410
Where was this at the Improv,

946
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:02,400
like you guys were all hanging out and my
cousin's like, go. I met Joe and I said,

947
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,530
Oh really? Did you tell him you're
my cousin? And he's like, ah,

948
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,490
like a lot of thought when you do that.
He's like, I don't know. I said, well,

949
00:53:08,491 --> 00:53:11,010
what did you say goes well,
I like you. After he left,

950
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:15,570
it was Kim and Callan and he said, yeah,
I think my cousin is friends with Joe.

951
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,640
And Callen goes, who's your cousin?
He goes, Burke, Chrysler Gallegos.

952
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,700
Your guns is burned. You
haven't even brought that up.
Yeah, that's a weird thing.

953
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:25,740
Not Blowing up at a comedy club. He's
been hanging out with Kalyn like weeks.

954
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,040
He's never mentioned that he's my cousin
because fucking socially retarded.

955
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,170
How did he hang out? Why is he hanging
out with Callan? What's going on?

956
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,700
I have no idea.
He's like a screen.

957
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:36,690
He's a writer and he's trying to put
something together for Kalyn and so a,

958
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:39,450
and so they, I don't know, you know Khalil
is like a good guy. So he's like, Hey,

959
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:43,130
come hang out with a beer. We'll watch
the fight or whatever. And that counts.

960
00:53:43,131 --> 00:53:43,681
Like come down,

961
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:47,490
we're doing comedy juice and then you
and him are all hanging out. I go, Andy,

962
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:51,660
Andrew, you're in a moment. We could just
simply make things very casual and say,

963
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:55,110
hey my cousin's Bert Kreischer and you
would've just been like, oh how cool.

964
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,820
And that's it. He would have never
leveraged it by go fucking bring it up.

965
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:00,061
He goes,

966
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:02,790
oh and then maybe next time maybe he's
like I'm tired of being bird crushed.

967
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:06,900
His cousins want to be
much so would it be me man,

968
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,500
this is fucking bullshit.
Part living limiting your fucking shadow.

969
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,570
It's just interesting the
way people carry themselves.

970
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:15,260
Cause I'm the first
person like that if like,

971
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,640
like if I ran into Eddie
probably on the street, I was,

972
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:20,730
first of all I was like I it's Bert Cause
I never think anyone remembers my name

973
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,500
by be like it has Bert.
I'm friends with Joe.

974
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:27,000
Like I would connect the tissue right
away. Yeah, that's probably the best way.

975
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,770
But then if you've done that,

976
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,350
never have someone do that and then you
bring it up to the person and they go,

977
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,750
I don't know that fucking dude.
That's weird.

978
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:38,610
When someone like becomes really friendly
with you under false pretenses that it

979
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:42,630
finds you find out they don't really
know that person. Yeah. That's awkward.

980
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,321
Really.

981
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:47,960
All I was afraid that I was afraid when
I was met Hixon that saying that I had,

982
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,400
I had roll,
I'd world round with his brother.

983
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,550
I didn't know if they were friends or not.
They have issues.

984
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,790
I was fucking nervous saying that
I'm an idiot. No, it's not an,

985
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,640
you're not an idiot at
all. No big deal. I mean,

986
00:54:58,641 --> 00:55:01,140
just because they have issues doesn't
mean you have to have issues with them,

987
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,610
but why can't I just be confident
enough to go, hi, my name's Bert.

988
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:07,230
It's very nice to meet you because you
wanted to tell a story and you know, be,

989
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,250
you know, I've had some experiences
with Jujitsu. Yeah. As an untrained God,

990
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,310
that was unhurt Burt, right? Yeah.
That was the craziest fucking shall,

991
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,870
I couldn't believe what
you did on that show.

992
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,780
I'm glad you didn't get totally hurt.
I got what God did.

993
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:21,630
I broke my ribs and broke my foot.
Yeah, but you're alive. Yeah. Yeah.

994
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:22,380
I'm glad I'm alive.

995
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,850
Totally hurt is dead cause there's a lot
of fucking shows where you could easily

996
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:31,500
get totally hurt. Yeah, I could, I,
I could have really gotten fucked up,

997
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,210
but thank God I didn't.

998
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,930
I W I w I mean I I the thing I was
telling some about it the other day,

999
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,620
the thing that was crazy about doing that
show was that like we technically shot

1000
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:44,730
a porn one day. Really? Oh
yeah. Like no questions asked.

1001
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:48,420
They sent me to a Dominatrix camp and
they sent me to a dominatrix and then I

1002
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:51,780
was the gimp. So like I was
tortured for like, not even like,

1003
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,980
not even like 30 minutes for like
five hours. Dude, they bring me in

1004
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:02,430
for folks only listening. He just said,
dude. And then he scooted his chair back,

1005
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:06,270
put his hands on the rest and
adjusted himself. Here we go.

1006
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:09,180
I they show the whole premise was,
I didn't know what I was going to do,

1007
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,880
but I was walking a mile in another
man's shoes. So I show up to,

1008
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:16,320
this place is on,
it's like downtown by the Ralphs downtown.

1009
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:19,560
If you take six all the way down, it's
like I'm in a mansion down there. Right.

1010
00:56:19,561 --> 00:56:23,800
But right in that area, a downtown
mansion, it was a huge fucking house.

1011
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,200
I didn't even know they had
mansions downtown, old school.

1012
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:29,050
That's where la started. Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you,

1013
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,260
La is an interesting town because it
downtown was where everything started.

1014
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:36,070
So the further out you go is the
expanse of the expanse of La.

1015
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,780
And then they'd make a leap to the beach.

1016
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:42,280
So the connective tissue from the beach
to downtown and hey, Brian, shut the door.

1017
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:46,810
Did. And so, um, so anyway, so
they, they take me to this mansion,

1018
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,350
I'm in the van and then
this dude comes out,

1019
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,810
turn that switch,
turn that light on.

1020
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,740
This dude comes out with a blindfold
and he's like, put this on.

1021
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:01,510
So I put it on and then two girls
grabbed me by both arms and like walk me

1022
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:04,510
through a mansion and I'm walking
through this like downstairs,

1023
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:08,530
upstairs up these stairs. And then
I can feel the lights up, a room on,

1024
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:12,190
like I can feel the energy change.
So I go and I sit in a, in a,

1025
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,760
in a gynecological exam table but it's
steel and as I sit they start taking my

1026
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,960
pants off. They take my shirt
off. I'm like, I don't want
to her. And they're like,

1027
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:23,230
don't worry, you won't need it.
Totally naked. Totally naked worry.

1028
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:28,090
You won't need it. Totally
naked. Me Up my arms first,

1029
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,200
then my legs.

1030
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:33,310
Then they take the blindfold off and is
this chick mistress Isabella and she is

1031
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:38,311
in straight up latex outfit with her tits
billing out a zipper on her vagina and

1032
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:40,900
she has a cattle prod.
She's like,

1033
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:44,080
today you're going to be a gap and just
prods me in the balls and I'm like, God.

1034
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,800
I'm like, ah. And the cal probably
electrical like electrical prod,

1035
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,940
like not like not, not in a cat. I'm,

1036
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:55,050
I'm using large terms to express the the
event but like not like a like that now

1037
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,060
but like electric shock,
like boutique and shocks.

1038
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,430
My balls like blank and I'm like,

1039
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,400
and we are producers allowed
all this to take place.

1040
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:05,710
My producers were sitting on
apple boxes in front of me.

1041
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:09,160
They're all sitting on our boxes with
camera men that are sitting on tripods.

1042
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,650
They've got lights all
over around Marnie Hochman,

1043
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,530
the executive at the time
for Fox is sitting there too,

1044
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:18,250
and for like three hours and they
put five pound weights on my balls.

1045
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,780
They fucking pounds, nipple clamps
with weights on the nipple clamps,

1046
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:28,300
candle wax. And it won't, what? Go ahead.
Pop five pounds. They work up to that.

1047
00:58:28,301 --> 00:58:30,580
They can put a one pounder
and then, uh, they put,

1048
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:34,360
they put this thing around your balls
that looks like a bracelet. It's,

1049
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,050
it looked just like this. They put her
on your balls like this. And then the,

1050
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:39,310
and it's got two sides,

1051
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:43,320
like Hasidic Jewish is
ringlets that are chains.

1052
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,190
And then they put a weight
on it just holds them down.

1053
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:49,170
It didn't actually hurt that bad, but
uh, then the lady said, all right,

1054
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,140
are you ready? Would you
rather the speculum? And I
was like, next. She's like,

1055
00:58:53,141 --> 00:58:55,210
or the sounds. And I was like, oh,

1056
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:59,740
the sound's so she brings meaning open
your asshole. I'm sorry. Any speculation,

1057
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:01,900
I'm guessing. Yeah. So she puts,

1058
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,550
opens the this leather briefcase and
there's different like steel rods that are

1059
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,550
look like look like this thin,
they're like this and the summer,

1060
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:12,070
different shaped and I was like,
I want the sounds,

1061
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:12,791
I don't even know what that has been.

1062
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:16,120
It looks like harmonic tuning forks that
you'd hit and go boom and then put by

1063
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:20,290
my balls and I'd be like,
and she goes, all right, he
wants to sounds lube them up.

1064
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:24,920
I go lube them up. Where do you,
where do you put them? She goes, we,

1065
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,880
we put them in your urethra.
And I was like, oh I go,

1066
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:32,930
why the fuck do you call them the sounds
then and not dick sticks or something

1067
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:37,490
else. She goes cause each one makes
you make a different sound. I was,

1068
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,710
oh that's not sounds and I was done.
It's not sounds,

1069
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:47,330
if you have to make them yourself,
that's like going to a hamburger place.

1070
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:51,800
They go, all right. Did you bring your own
beef? Like what was the hamburger place?

1071
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:55,310
The fuck, you don't sell hamburgers,
the sounds you make your own sounds.

1072
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,320
She's going to play me like an instrument.
So you did this for how long? I,

1073
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,630
probably four hours and
then we went downstairs.

1074
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,120
She was actually pretty cool and she was
pretty hot. Hot, like pretty hot six.

1075
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,960
Uh, I'm gonna say I'm gonna
say hard seven low eight.

1076
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,280
[inaudible] seven [inaudible] seven like,
like she like a definite set.

1077
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,960
It's hard to judge because
she was in lay tech,

1078
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:21,250
so anyone in latex automatically
it's like a six. But,

1079
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,690
but she had a really pretty face,
but she had like the, you know,

1080
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:25,910
the kind of face where you're like,
I'm attracted to it,

1081
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:28,070
but it's not like my ideal.
Okay.

1082
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,620
Like the kind of chick that if
she's a librarian you'd fuck her.

1083
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:34,850
But if she worked as a Hooters waitress
and you're like, Eh, you know what I mean?

1084
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,180
Google or Google or Mr Bella.
No, no, no. But you can see
what she looks like. She's,

1085
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,340
I don't want to give her any press.

1086
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:43,640
He's out there needle and
people and putting fucking
sounds and their dick. Yeah.

1087
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:46,570
She was like, this one
dude came out and like, uh,

1088
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:50,330
it looked like he got done
in the gym. Okay. He had like
a bag on and he was like,

1089
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,430
look like you get cleaned up and
he just gotten out of the gym.

1090
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:54,050
I think that's the only
way I can express it.

1091
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:58,630
Became out of this door from ups
downstairs. I go, who is he? She goes, oh,

1092
01:00:58,631 --> 01:01:01,160
well I'll see you later. And he's
like, bye. Thank you. She's like,

1093
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:04,010
he's been down there for the weekend.
I was like, what? And she's like, yeah,

1094
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:07,310
some people pay to stay down there. And
I tortured them throughout the weekend.

1095
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:11,060
Oh God. And I was like, really?
And then the whole, all right,

1096
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:12,380
pull a picture of this bitch up I need,

1097
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:15,860
his mistress is a Bella and I say
bitch with all love and respect, she's,

1098
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:18,680
I'm sure she'd want the press
of people buying or videos.

1099
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,220
What if she's still doing it?
I'll never forget that name though.

1100
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,210
Mr and she had hurt her assistant was
this Asian chick who was hot as fuck.

1101
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,310
This is the best part of the whole
thing is at the very beginning,

1102
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:30,920
they look at my dick and
it's so small and she looks,

1103
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:35,120
yells back to the Asian shake. She goes,
we're working with a blood cock. I go,

1104
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:38,320
what? She goes, we're working with a
blood cock. I go, you're talking to me?

1105
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,410
She goes, yeah, you're, you have a blood
cock. What does that mean? I go, exactly.

1106
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,330
I'm like, what? What? As opposed
to, and I'm like, is there,

1107
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,510
do I have a venereal disease? Like
something going on? She goes, no, no, no.

1108
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:50,300
There's Meat Cox and there's blood Cox.
You have a blood cock.

1109
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,840
It means that when blood shows up
to your cock, it then looks good,

1110
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,560
but until that blood's there, it doesn't
look any good. When you have a meat cock,

1111
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:00,200
you have a lot of meat on your cock
and then very little room for blood.

1112
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,550
So guys that have big Dick soft or meet
Cox, she's hot. It's fucked dude. Yup.

1113
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,350
That's her. That looks like her. Yeah.

1114
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:10,630
That really looks like her mistress
Isabella. Is She in la? Yeah.

1115
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,480
She's beautiful. Yeah. She's, she's not
a seven. My balls were getting tortured.

1116
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,740
I don't fucking remember perfectly.

1117
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,840
Maybe this is just like a really
good picture of it. But that, yeah,

1118
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,020
that does look like her cause she
has like a, yeah, she's pretty hot.

1119
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,590
That's pretty hot. I wouldn't
say that. I'd say that.

1120
01:02:24,591 --> 01:02:26,450
It's like at least that picture,

1121
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,310
the picture that I'm looking
at going back to the other,

1122
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,930
she gave me a bunch of videos.

1123
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,380
I have videos of what it was
back when you go to that.

1124
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,320
I mean I have a blank screen

1125
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,530
VCR. She gave me a bunch of VCRs
of like dominatrix stuff, man.

1126
01:02:38,531 --> 01:02:43,050
Some of the shit was so hot. VCR
tapes of dominatrix stuff. Yeah.

1127
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:46,060
This is before you could like get
online and have quick Internet to watch

1128
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:47,020
whatever the fuck you want.

1129
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,400
So like do you mean you've always
had fast internet but like,

1130
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,810
but like there was a very big
period of time up until like,

1131
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:59,811
I want to say like 2004 that like
downloading porn just took forever.

1132
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:03,370
Unless you had like Dsl
and this was before then.

1133
01:03:03,371 --> 01:03:08,230
This is probably 2001 and so 2002 and so
she gave me a bunch of BCR. She's like,

1134
01:03:08,231 --> 01:03:10,880
cause she did one thing that really
turned me on and I was like, Whoa,

1135
01:03:10,881 --> 01:03:12,130
what the fuck was that?
And then,

1136
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,620
and then I regressed in the middle of
all this torturing and I remember the

1137
01:03:14,621 --> 01:03:19,300
first thing I ever saw sexually was
that a new stand and it was dom,

1138
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,640
it was a girl's tied up
when I was like first grade.

1139
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:24,730
So first thing I ever saw
and I went, whew, she was,
we'll check these videos out,

1140
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:27,880
see if you like them. And like I
wish I still had one of the videos.

1141
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:33,810
So she did something to you while you
were in the middle of being tortured.

1142
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:35,990
He did like, well you just
fucking hit it. Whatever it is.

1143
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:40,930
I said, marshmallow, safe word
marshmallow. Give me the fuck Outta here.

1144
01:03:40,931 --> 01:03:44,290
I don't want to blow a load in front
of everybody. Wow. Is that good? Yeah,

1145
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,570
it was with latex and
she had me bound like,

1146
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:50,740
like you were sending a package to
somebody and she was and I was like,

1147
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,510
and I get,

1148
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,760
see what I want. If I was going
to talk to a woman like that,

1149
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:56,070
I would want to know what she
does in her personal life.

1150
01:03:56,071 --> 01:03:59,940
Like this is like your job,
like you like super normal,

1151
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,170
you know like

1152
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,480
they're usually submissive when their
mistress in their personal life. Yeah.

1153
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,390
At least all the people that I know
a lot of those guys because at my ex

1154
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:10,250
girlfriend and all of
them like spank beat.

1155
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:15,230
I know this one girl that would go up
to San Francisco and get her ass kicked

1156
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:19,400
by, a guy would pay her money just to get
her ass kicked and just come back like

1157
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:19,550
thousands of dollars.

1158
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:23,430
But usually in real life stop or
pay her money to get her asking.

1159
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,780
What do you mean there's
the whole community's really
fucked up. Like there's,

1160
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,560
there's mistresses and the are,
there's guys that do it all.

1161
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:32,510
So the guys are creepy. Guys
are creepy as you saying. No,

1162
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:36,140
the guy would beat her up. The guy would
pretty much beat her up, like what would,

1163
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:40,280
what we would think is beating up.
But to her it was called a fetish.

1164
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,260
It would be like spanking,
beating.

1165
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:46,220
You would have electrical prods that
you would like electrocute the person.

1166
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:50,370
She would come back black and blue
every time he would pay her. Yeah.

1167
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,313
And then she got off

1168
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:55,040
show up and he got off on beating her.
Yes. Oh, I wouldn't trust to do that.

1169
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,510
I would think that that guy is
going to take it too far. Yeah.

1170
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,630
Get his credit card number first.
That's not enough.

1171
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:06,540
Your Dad, you going to fucking use it
on amazon.com fuck you. I'm a ghost.

1172
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:10,890
I'm ordering Shit Online.
Nature box.

1173
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:12,370
I don't know why,

1174
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:16,420
but for me it's one thing like if a dude
likes to get tied up and beat up by a

1175
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:18,100
check,
that's as disturbing as

1176
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,870
a guy who wants to beat a
checkup. The Dai, the guy,

1177
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,400
a guy wanting to bt checkup is fucking,
that's dangerous to me. That's scary.

1178
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:27,340
Don't chew in front of a
microphone burden. It's just
weird. I can't help it, man.

1179
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:28,121
You got me on these fucking,

1180
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:31,300
just push the microphone aside or
don't eat while the podcast is on.

1181
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,840
It's only a couple hours, buddy. You can
get through it. I know you can do it.

1182
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:39,560
You're strong. You're strong.
Bert. Kreischer yeah, I
don't know. I don't deal.

1183
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:44,450
There's some really bums me out about a
guy that wants a beat up a check. Yeah.

1184
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,360
Well this is, I mean Panger well yeah, at
least he's going about it the right way.

1185
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:53,140
Is it? I mean really. I mean, I don't
know man. It makes me think of like,

1186
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,950
what was it? Was it seven? Was it
the movie? Psycho American psycho.

1187
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:57,940
That's what it was.
Yeah.

1188
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,780
American psycho where he would do fucked
up shit to them and then pay them and

1189
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:05,510
then he ran into the girl on
the street and she's like,
no, get away. He's like it.

1190
01:06:05,511 --> 01:06:06,760
He's going to,
I would love for you.

1191
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:09,740
I would love for you to get a high
end prostituting here like the girl,

1192
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,530
but just to hear her stories of like,

1193
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:14,830
I guarantee you she's got some fucked up
stories. This is not about that though.

1194
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:18,370
When you get a high end prostitute,
you don't hear stories, just fuck them.

1195
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:22,120
Jesus Christ, we, me and
my buddy Eddie saw this,

1196
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:27,270
I mean the hottest chick I've ever seen
in my life in Vegas where we're just

1197
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:31,120
walking around and this girl comes up,
she's like, if you guys want to party.

1198
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,790
And I remember thinking,
not knowing she was a prostitute,

1199
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,800
the hottest girl I've
ever seen in my life.

1200
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,120
And I was like 10 10 no questions asked,
10 after a car accident,

1201
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:44,170
10 in a softball uniform. And I was
like, well, I was like, fuck yeah.

1202
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:48,430
And she was like 1500 bucks an hour,
like 1500 like I remember going,

1203
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,413
how good is that?

1204
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:54,450
It's gotta be amazing for stupid rich
billionaire dude who 15 I mean if you have

1205
01:06:55,331 --> 01:06:59,560
$1 billion, what's 1500 bucks?
It's like 50 bucks to you.

1206
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:02,170
Probably not even five bucks.
Five bucks to you.

1207
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,490
What do you think the market price,

1208
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:06,640
the fair market portrayed pipes for
Pocius what do you want to know?

1209
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,140
I think that if you're
getting like a streetwalker,

1210
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,010
you got one thing and then I can get
up to like several thousand dollars.

1211
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:16,820
There was a woman who used to,
uh,

1212
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:21,010
there was a website and it got brought
up on my message board and bunch of dudes

1213
01:07:21,011 --> 01:07:25,330
got so mean with her. It's just, I
felt real bad because, uh, they were,

1214
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:29,560
they were like going back and forth with
her and I think she even signed up on

1215
01:07:29,561 --> 01:07:30,394
my message board,

1216
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,330
but it was some insane amount of money
was like $6,000 an hour or something like

1217
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:35,164
that.

1218
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:40,150
Maybe $6,000 a day or $3,000 an hour or
you could do the whole evening for six

1219
01:07:40,151 --> 01:07:43,780
grand or something like that.
But it's a lot of money. And um,

1220
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:47,110
a lot of them have websites and they,
you know,

1221
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,640
they will like talk about themselves and
these very flattering and glowing terms

1222
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:55,030
and talk about their interest and
all that. And you're like, yeah,

1223
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:59,050
but you're a prostitute. Like if, if
all these things were awesome about you,

1224
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:03,430
why would you be a prostitute?
That's the weird thing about prostitutes.

1225
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:05,230
Like this guy had a
real interesting point.

1226
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:06,730
I was watching this ted
video the other day,

1227
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,720
we were just talking about prostitutes.
Yeah,

1228
01:08:08,721 --> 01:08:12,580
I was talking about prostitutes and he
was always talking about pornography and

1229
01:08:12,581 --> 01:08:14,140
like what's negative about pornography?

1230
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,160
And one of the things was
talking about was like

1231
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,790
this social exile aspect
of it that like say if you,

1232
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,460
okay,
like here's the perfect example.

1233
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,580
I would invite you over to my house
anytime you want to come over and have

1234
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:28,370
dinner and you've been over my house
before for my kids' parties and shit.

1235
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:29,204
You're a good friend.

1236
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:34,310
But if you told me that you
had been to a prostitute, um,

1237
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:37,160
it wouldn't affect me at all. Like
I wouldn't, I wouldn't go, oh,

1238
01:08:37,161 --> 01:08:40,250
fucking birds never coming over
my house again. That's sick. Fuck.

1239
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:43,580
Of course a w over.
But if you had been a prostitute,

1240
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,590
I would never have you over.

1241
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,820
And the well he was saying is we will
sit down with people that have been to

1242
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:51,770
brothels and we have no reservations.

1243
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,740
Like people who have been to brothels
several times. We'll laugh it off.

1244
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:59,240
But you don't sit down
with prostitutes when you,

1245
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:02,750
when a person actually pays for sex,
that's one thing.

1246
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:07,070
But when a person gets paid for sex,
especially a woman,

1247
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:11,900
like we put them in this like very
undesirable social outcast category.

1248
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,710
Yeah. So I mean, you
know, Molly crab apple,

1249
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,280
she's a artist who was on the podcast.
One's very talented art.

1250
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:24,000
It's a very interesting thinker too.
She's very, very smart woman. And um, uh,

1251
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,680
she, she has friends that are a
sex workers, you know, and she's,

1252
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,480
she doesn't see anything wrong with it.
You know,

1253
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:32,000
her attitude is what's the big
deal? It's just sex, you know,

1254
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:35,630
that's what they do and they have a good
time and they liked their clients and

1255
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:40,340
you know, she has friends who
do it and you could see it
that way. I could, I mean,

1256
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:44,450
she obviously did and she's very
intelligent. But I think for most of us,

1257
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,530
that's not how we see it.

1258
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:49,730
We put people in a category and that's
like a forbidden thing to do. Right?

1259
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:50,564
I mean,
when you agree,

1260
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,860
there's definitely different
kinds of prostitutes.

1261
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:57,330
Like I back in the day before I even knew
one, I would, I would think that also,

1262
01:09:57,331 --> 01:10:01,530
but nowadays with these
porn, uh, prostitutes, like
there's a website that don't,

1263
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,131
I won't say,

1264
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:06,830
but it's all the high end prostitutes
that are in porn and you can sit there and

1265
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,720
and pick which one you want
and then you have to send,

1266
01:10:09,721 --> 01:10:11,880
you have to go to the doctor,
you have to get tested.

1267
01:10:11,881 --> 01:10:15,030
You have to send your reports to them.
You have to give your driver's license,

1268
01:10:15,031 --> 01:10:16,640
your credit card you have there,
they would do it.

1269
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,590
They're going to do a full background
check. Once all this happens,

1270
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,440
then you get like approved.
But every time you want a new prostitute,

1271
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:25,530
if it's after 30 days, just like a porn
star, you have to get retested again,

1272
01:10:25,531 --> 01:10:28,140
send them, send the information.
But these are high end people.

1273
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,400
These are presidents of companies.

1274
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:34,550
These girls are like anywhere from
two to $6,000 but it that come to me,

1275
01:10:34,741 --> 01:10:37,440
it's like, okay, this is just like
porn. You're just doing porn now.

1276
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:40,080
This is the person's been tested,
background check, blah blah, blah.

1277
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,710
You're doing it maybe once a
month to get an extra $6,000.

1278
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,710
I can see that a little bit more
than like somebody that's like, Hey,

1279
01:10:46,711 --> 01:10:50,010
I have a room at the motel six,
I'm going to be here all day in and out.

1280
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:53,010
That to me that's disgusting. That's
like a, that's like a horrible,

1281
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,870
that's like what I think a prostitute is.

1282
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:58,250
Well a lot of them was just like when
they're that it's just drug addicts that

1283
01:10:58,251 --> 01:11:01,130
are making poor decisions because they
have to take chances because they need to

1284
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:05,810
get their fix. Well you're talking
about is like a slick escort situation,

1285
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:09,170
which yeah,
for the girl probably definitely better.

1286
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,420
And for the guy probably better too.

1287
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:13,200
And it's way better than
porn if you think it.

1288
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:15,240
Cause I mean like these people
are presidents of companies,

1289
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:18,700
they've been tested and everything. No
one knows about it. We're like pig a pig.

1290
01:11:18,701 --> 01:11:20,490
Oh about it.
They have a database,

1291
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:24,880
you know about credit cards and
they told you, right, well why?

1292
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:29,820
What meaning like a doctor,
they get tested for STDs.

1293
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:33,840
Right. But what I'm saying is it's not
advertised for the whole road to be like,

1294
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:36,480
oh look at this person's butthole and
pussy and they're getting fucked by this

1295
01:11:36,481 --> 01:11:39,840
guy. You know, it's like you don't get
to see it. So I see what you're saying.

1296
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:44,730
It's a little different. It's weird.
Well look, my, my stance on it of course

1297
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,780
is it, everything should be
illegal. I mean I think if
you want to get your balls,

1298
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:52,290
cattle prodded and you know, you want
to get beat up by some dominatrix,

1299
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:56,130
of course it should be illegal.
Obviously. I, I have more of a problem,

1300
01:11:56,131 --> 01:12:00,330
like I said with a woman
getting beat up. I just, my,

1301
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:05,640
my core, my DNA, here's that. I just
go like that. That, I don't know,

1302
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,580
cause I feel like a guy that would
want to beat the shit out of a woman.

1303
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:09,414
Like I don't like it.

1304
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,720
There's something deep seated. There's
something dirty inside that not just dirty

1305
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:14,850
like I,
I think they're dangerous.

1306
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:19,900
Like a woman is physically weaker
than a man. Like did the display,

1307
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:24,950
like it makes more sense to me that a
man would want to get beat up by a woman

1308
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,820
because it's, it's not, you have to give
into her to do that. Like you could just,

1309
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:32,700
she could hit you too hard and you'd be
like, bitch, what the fuck did you just,

1310
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:35,910
you know, like it would change
the whole thing. But these guys,

1311
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:40,050
a lot of them that are these
dominatrix, um, clients,

1312
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:41,610
they're um,

1313
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:46,380
they're like really powerful people who
are in these positions where they run

1314
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:49,200
companies and they have all these people
that listened to them and they have to

1315
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:52,800
be buttoned down all day and they
were in ties and shit and never speak.

1316
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:57,060
And they'd get there. Yes, mistress.
Yes, mistress and the you kiss my foot,

1317
01:12:57,061 --> 01:12:59,940
you piece of shit. Yeah. This
mistress, like they like that.

1318
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:04,530
It's like a free release to them and the
chick beats him up and kicks him in the

1319
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:07,830
balls and shit. Like it doesn't bother
me. I mean, maybe it's hypocritical.

1320
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:11,040
Maybe I'm now minded in my thinking,
but I fuck,

1321
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:13,650
I got a real problem with a guy
wants to beat the shit out of check.

1322
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,720
I think you, I think a lot of us
do. It's really fucked up too.

1323
01:13:16,721 --> 01:13:18,760
But the guy that I'm talking about,
the supposedly,

1324
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:22,100
I mean I know a couple of people
that used to do this and, and the,

1325
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:26,410
it would be like dentist's chair
in a room like dark, like Dexter.

1326
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,900
They get tied up and then
just like different things.

1327
01:13:28,901 --> 01:13:32,190
You pull out his like little tools and
the whole time just like fucking sitting

1328
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:34,360
there with a hard on with her.
No one

1329
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,830
that's a bunch of bad life decision.

1330
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,320
How many of those girls one up getting
killed and they must happen. It must.

1331
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,910
It must.
I mean how many girls

1332
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:46,030
killed every year by Johns?
I mean it must happen.

1333
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:49,270
Do you remember that guy in Vancouver?
Not Vancouver.

1334
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,710
Was a outside of Vancouver somewhere.

1335
01:13:50,711 --> 01:13:54,370
BC who is a serial killer who
killing prostitutes and feeding them.

1336
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:55,210
Knew his pigs.

1337
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,970
I heard pigs leave fucking anything.
Yeah, they'll eat anything. Yeah.

1338
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:02,970
There was that movie snatch.
Right. What movie is that? Yeah,

1339
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:06,630
that's where I learned it. Dammit.
Fuck can say something like,

1340
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:09,660
I learned it and then I'm like, Oh,
you learned that all the real world.

1341
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:19,910
You fucking say some real
deep philosophical shit
and turns out puck said it

1342
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:21,004
first.

1343
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:27,370
I can't believe we're sober.
Hey man,

1344
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:32,110
we can be funny sober and have
fun sober that. Yeah, I've uh,

1345
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,620
I don't know what I was saying, but
yeah, I'm fucking an idiot. Pigs,

1346
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:38,110
pigs and prostitutes. Pigs. Yeah.

1347
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:43,020
Yeah. Pigs are fucking voracious
eaters, man. They're ruthless. They, uh,

1348
01:14:43,021 --> 01:14:46,500
they would just run through bodies. They,
you know, you throw a body in there.

1349
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:49,890
If anything, you know, any
kind of an animal, they just
eat, they'll eat everything.

1350
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,680
They'll eat everything.
The only thing you're supposed to do,

1351
01:14:52,681 --> 01:14:55,620
if you try to get rid of a body
and you throw it in a pig pen,

1352
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,870
is he supposed to smash the teeth?
Cause they'll, they won't, uh,

1353
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,370
they won't eat the teeth. Totally.
Really let him down. Yeah.

1354
01:15:02,371 --> 01:15:05,670
The teeth will come out whole and then
you have dental records and shit like

1355
01:15:05,671 --> 01:15:06,960
that mother fucker you need,

1356
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,120
he's like a hardcore coffee
grinder and you throw the tea.

1357
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,370
Oh, make it shut up. I'm Vitamix.

1358
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:17,500
Oh yeah. Tech. You ever
seen a BLENDTEC blender?

1359
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:20,110
Fucking iPhone.
You should try teeth next time.

1360
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:24,370
So I knew what I wanted to talk to
you about. Bulletproof coffee. Okay.

1361
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:27,040
So I'm sitting with my dad
in Tampa. He's like, buddy,

1362
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:29,470
I'm going to give you the best coffee
I've ever had. I was like, what?

1363
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:32,470
And he's like me and Bartol level of him.
It's his best friend I go to. He goes,

1364
01:15:32,471 --> 01:15:35,320
bulletproof coffee, you're going to
fucking love it. But he's not doing,

1365
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:39,010
he's not getting bulletproof coffee. He's
just using organic coffee. That's fine.

1366
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,530
And then doing the mix. Well, you
know, that's fine, right? Yeah.

1367
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:45,070
But I feel bad cause there's a bullet
proof of his steed. ASPREY, Dave Asprey.

1368
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:48,280
Don't feel bad because,
let me explain to you all the fallout.

1369
01:15:48,281 --> 01:15:52,150
I don't know if you've paid attention
to what happened. No. Um, okay.

1370
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:57,330
The original idea of mixing up and
bulletproof executive is Dave Asprey's

1371
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:01,240
company and he has bulletproof this and
bulletproof that and it's like sort of a

1372
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:03,940
marketing labeling thing. Yeah. So
he called it bulletproof coffee.

1373
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:07,540
It was actually invented by a guy named
Rob Wolf and Robb Wolf came up with it a

1374
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:11,710
long time ago and wrote about it,
about mixing MCT oil and butter in coffee.

1375
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,480
Now real quick,
MCT oil is medium

1376
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:19,570
chain triglyceride oil and what it is
is they take the most nutritious aspects

1377
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:22,730
of coconut oil and some
different kinds of oil.

1378
01:16:22,731 --> 01:16:24,700
They spin them in a centrifuge
and they take out this,

1379
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:27,670
I'm just using coconut oil.
Coconut oil is fine. Okay.

1380
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:30,670
Coconut oil is a very good
for virgin or reverse margin.

1381
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:33,710
Now you don't want to if you
want raw raw coconut on. Yeah,

1382
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,410
it's very good for you. Yeah. Um, anyway,

1383
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:41,770
so what Aspery was telling us was
that his coffee was uniquely free of

1384
01:16:43,881 --> 01:16:47,600
Mycotoxins and that mycotoxins
where we give people headaches,

1385
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:50,540
mycotoxins would cause you to crash.
All these,

1386
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:53,420
all these different things he was
attributing to microtoxins and he was even

1387
01:16:53,421 --> 01:16:57,560
saying that point being, here's
the point, he had no tests.

1388
01:16:57,561 --> 01:16:59,090
He wasn't showing us anything like,

1389
01:16:59,091 --> 01:17:02,240
like he was saying that all these
different coffees of Mycotoxin,

1390
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,770
it's a real issue.
No one talks about it,

1391
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,570
but when you start
reading about it online,

1392
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,640
I found out that this
wasn't an issue at all.

1393
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:10,670
Like it wasn't something that people
talking about that were involved in the

1394
01:17:10,671 --> 01:17:14,780
coffee world. Like there had been
mycotoxin issues in the past,

1395
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:18,650
but they figured out a bunch of
different way, cold or wet processing,

1396
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,090
a bunch of different ways to deal
with coffee. See all coffee. This is,

1397
01:17:23,091 --> 01:17:28,091
I found this because I had a peer Giuliani
on the podcast who is a coffee expert

1398
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,610
relation to Rudy. Fascinating
guy. No, I think that's his name.

1399
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:36,530
Make sure that's this right named Peter
Giuliani. I want to, I don't want to, or

1400
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:40,560
I've been to many conversations with
Todd Carmichael's on travel channel.

1401
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:42,780
He does. Uh, he does.
He's a coffee expert.

1402
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:44,640
He does like dangerous grounds
is the name of the show.

1403
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:49,020
Peter Juliano. That's his name
if Tyree. Very good guy. Anyway,

1404
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:54,090
so all coffee comes from
Ethiopia, all of it. All of it.

1405
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:59,160
Every coffee that's ever been made
outside of Ethiopia was originally in

1406
01:17:59,161 --> 01:18:02,520
Ethiopia and then they took it
somewhere else and grew coffee there.

1407
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:07,020
So whether it's, I thought all coffee
came from Colombia. Yeah, me too.

1408
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:09,870
I thought it was like South American
cause you always hear about Colombian

1409
01:18:09,871 --> 01:18:13,950
coffee and that fucking Juan
manwell. What's his name? One one,

1410
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:19,020
you know Juan Valdez? Juan, is that
right? Was his fucking donkey. Well No,

1411
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:22,890
it's a black guy picking coffee
in Ethiopia. It's an Ethiopian,

1412
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:27,690
this thousands of different
strains in Ethiopia and maybe,

1413
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:32,730
I think he said three to five elsewhere.
It's crazy.

1414
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:37,530
Wow. All coffee comes from Ethiopia. Okay,
okay. Maybe it's more than three to five,

1415
01:18:37,531 --> 01:18:41,850
but it's a s a minuscule percentage.
I don't remember the exact numbers.

1416
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:46,740
Um, so be calm. Ethiopia
is a very dry climate.

1417
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:50,160
It's a very,
very unique in that respect.

1418
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:53,220
When they were taking coffee
other places and growing it,

1419
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:54,720
they were dealing with moisture.

1420
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:59,490
They were dealing with mold that was
growing and it took them a while to figure

1421
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:02,610
out that this is bad. They still
have coffee, rust is still an issue.

1422
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,390
But what he was saying,
what asked me,

1423
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,370
we were saying with no evidence
whatsoever was that there was all these

1424
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:12,510
mycotoxin infected coffee everywhere you
look like a Starbucks and coffee bean,

1425
01:19:12,511 --> 01:19:16,830
it was all bad for you.
So we wound up doing tests.

1426
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:22,260
First Tate did a caveman coffee, tested
their coffee and um, Asprey's coffee,

1427
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:25,830
their coffee,
which is single estate plan from Colombia,

1428
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,320
turned out to have no
mycotoxins in it whatsoever.

1429
01:19:28,321 --> 01:19:33,321
It was all done co with wet processing
for coffee according to Tate,

1430
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,570
had below threshold levels,

1431
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:40,080
which means it's not significant of
two different types of mycotoxins.

1432
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:43,370
So that meant that his process,
whatever his process was, didn't,

1433
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,910
wasn't completely eliminating it,

1434
01:19:44,911 --> 01:19:47,720
but it was nothing where you
had to consider what it's,

1435
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:50,700
it's such a minuscule amount.
There's not dangerous to your body.

1436
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:53,280
So that gave us a red flag. So we
were like, well, what the fuck?

1437
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,980
So we start looking into it because
we had been parodying what he had been

1438
01:19:55,981 --> 01:19:57,940
saying about Michael [inaudible].
I had been, I should. Yeah.

1439
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,340
So then we wound up spending
a lot of money on these tests.

1440
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,690
We tested four different types of
coffee for a broad spectrum of uh,

1441
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:11,800
mycotoxins. None of them had any in it,
so he was saying like 75% of all coffee,

1442
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:15,570
mycotoxins in it, but his coffee is
uniquely, it's not true. It's just,

1443
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:16,890
it's just simply not true.

1444
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:22,040
So he was benefiting from this and it
left me with a real moral dilemma as one

1445
01:20:23,671 --> 01:20:27,300
of the owners of on it. Um,
should we still sell this coffee?

1446
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:31,890
Ultimately I decided I still drink it.
So there's nothing wrong with the coffee,

1447
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,810
but if you go into on its website,

1448
01:20:33,811 --> 01:20:36,510
you won't see any of that
bullshit about mycotoxins anymore.

1449
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,110
What it is is good single
source coffee and that's it.

1450
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:45,260
Any unique fucking method that he has of
eliminating mycotoxins is not only not

1451
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:46,344
necessary,

1452
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:51,440
it's unique only to him and not to the
entire rest of the fucking multibillion

1453
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,770
dollar coffee world. Like they know
how to take care of that shit. It's,

1454
01:20:55,860 --> 01:21:00,810
it's hooey. That's what it is. So if your
dad's using organic coffee, good coffee,

1455
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:05,430
I'm sure it's fine. And if it
wasn't fine, you would know.

1456
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:10,580
And not only that Doctor Rhonda Patrick
said that small levels of mycotoxins

1457
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:12,240
actually,

1458
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,800
they elicit a compensatory response from
your body that can even be beneficial.

1459
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:18,503
Really.

1460
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:22,220
I remember when you were saying like I,
the thing that made me kind of go,

1461
01:21:22,221 --> 01:21:24,260
well that doesn't seem right.
When I kept on going like,

1462
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:27,070
when are you going to test Starbucks?
And he's like, oh, it's really expensive.

1463
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:31,680
And it's not a thousand bucks across,
just like, you know, 4,000 bucks to test.

1464
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:34,490
But that would be a good test to have
if you had a company like am I spend a

1465
01:21:34,491 --> 01:21:38,600
$2,000 so I can say Starbucks had it and
you don't get anything Starbucks, right.

1466
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:43,490
Test. They're fucking coffee.
You know? It's just, it's,
it's really fucked up. Look,

1467
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:47,390
he is said in the past that he had
aspergers then he cured it with his

1468
01:21:47,391 --> 01:21:50,810
bulletproof diet.
I suspect he has not cured it.

1469
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,400
We're dealing with a bit of a
social issue here. It's not just,

1470
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:02,240
and he got famous from doing this stuff
and being on our podcast introduced him

1471
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:05,940
to millions,
literally millions of people,

1472
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,450
and I feel real responsible in that way
because a lot of people like you were

1473
01:22:09,451 --> 01:22:10,201
about to pair it,

1474
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:13,190
that your dad was doing it all wrong
because your dad was getting his coffee.

1475
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,080
It wasn't Michael Toxin
free. Guess what? Oh,

1476
01:22:16,081 --> 01:22:20,340
coffee essentially is fucking mycotoxins,
mycotoxins rail.

1477
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:24,120
But there's mycotoxins in everything.
There's mycotoxins in human breast milk.

1478
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:28,850
There's micro toxins in porn. Hi Britt,
you out. Let's not talk about that.

1479
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:33,360
We're going again. But there's, it's
not the issue that he made it out to be.

1480
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:33,961
Not only that,

1481
01:22:33,961 --> 01:22:37,710
he also said something that
I also should've fucking
chase down on him. He said,

1482
01:22:37,711 --> 01:22:41,520
his coffees you need gives you
an unique cognitive benefits.

1483
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:48,000
There's no mechanism in your coffee
that uniquely makes you smarter.

1484
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:52,290
It doesn't exist. It's just
coffee. You're, it's not,

1485
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,790
there's nothing special.

1486
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:58,350
It's not a genetically modified being
from Mars that makes you fucking brain

1487
01:22:58,351 --> 01:23:01,920
grow when you drink a cup of Java.
It's just fucking coffee.

1488
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:06,820
Does caffeine have cognitive benefits?
Yes, it does. Yes it does. Yes it does.

1489
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:08,710
It has been proven.
These things are proven.

1490
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:12,910
Does caffeine or those coffee have
antioxidant effects? Yes, it does.

1491
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:17,300
There's nothing bad with
it. I mean, there's a lot of
good aspects to coffee. It's,

1492
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:19,930
it's, it's not bad for you as long
as you drink it in moderation.

1493
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:24,490
But this idea that, you know, we got
fucked, we got hoodwinked. I liked the,

1494
01:23:24,491 --> 01:23:27,590
I liked the recipe though with,
I do a table at the pub up,

1495
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,530
a tablespoon and a half of coconut oil,
a do a teaspoon of that butter,

1496
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:37,030
that grass fed butter and a cup of coffee.
Dave's a very good collector of ideas.

1497
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:39,280
He's an excellent collector of ideas,
but he's,

1498
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:43,720
he doesn't have any degree in nutritional
science and in fact he got things

1499
01:23:43,721 --> 01:23:47,890
wrong. Completely opposite that Rhonda
Patrick was very upset about and she had a

1500
01:23:47,891 --> 01:23:50,820
correct on the podcast. Really? Yeah.
One of the things he got wrong was it,

1501
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:55,830
but he's talking about a diet and the
effect that famine has on jeans and he got

1502
01:23:56,261 --> 01:23:59,670
it the total opposite way.
There have been,

1503
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:03,910
there have been studies that have shown
that there's something about the body's

1504
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:08,560
compensatory reaction to famine that
actually can make the children of people

1505
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:12,310
who have gone through famine live longer.
He got it the opposite.

1506
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:16,930
He was saying that it made the children
who had parents that had nutritional

1507
01:24:16,931 --> 01:24:20,910
deficits that they lived shorter lives.
It's just he doesn't understand.

1508
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:25,240
He's just parroting things and that's
the problem with this whole thing with

1509
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:29,290
what he's essentially done with the
bulletproof coffee thing was an idea from

1510
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:32,410
the Paleo community.
Paleo community's all about healthy fats.

1511
01:24:32,411 --> 01:24:35,200
It's all about Avocados.
They're all about like their diet.

1512
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:40,490
The term Paleo has kind of been debunked
in a sense because the Paleolithic

1513
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:43,810
people, you know, they
didn't necessarily eat,

1514
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,860
I don't like the word Paleo for that
reason because scientifically it doesn't

1515
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:52,180
make sense, but here's why
it's good. The natural foods,

1516
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,690
vegetables, meats, fishes,

1517
01:24:55,810 --> 01:25:00,580
those things are easy for your body
to digest. Your is very, it's normal.

1518
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:05,530
You give your body a salad and a good
lean piece of chicken and your body has

1519
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:10,060
100%. It knows exactly what to do
with that. There's no confusion.

1520
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:12,820
You give your body a bowl
of pasta and it's like,

1521
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:17,821
what the fuck is this genetically modified
grain that you've turned into a pasta

1522
01:25:18,191 --> 01:25:20,170
that you boiled?
And then you've got,

1523
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:25,150
you've got sauce that's got
corn syrup in it, so there's,

1524
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:28,690
there's fucking high fructose corn
syrup and the sauce and all this.

1525
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:32,890
Your body just goes, oh cause he doesn't
know what the fuck to do with it.

1526
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:36,790
That's the difference between eating
Paleo and eating processed foods that are

1527
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:41,680
heavy in nitrates and antibiotics and
preservatives and all the bullshit that's

1528
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:45,070
in the common, you know, modern diet.

1529
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:48,190
That is where the Paleo people have it.
Right?

1530
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,040
And that there are benefits to having
healthy fats in your diet. It's,

1531
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:55,980
it's good for your skin, it's
good for your brain, you know, um,

1532
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,171
all the,

1533
01:25:57,171 --> 01:26:01,990
the different essential fatty acids that
you get from fish and that you get from

1534
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:04,040
different, like, like I said,

1535
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:08,030
Avocados and there's a lot of benefits
to eating healthy natural foods,

1536
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:09,620
so is is is the

1537
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:12,910
MCT oil and the and the grass fed butter,
is that just,

1538
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:16,090
is that just good fat for your
body or does that get the cause?

1539
01:26:16,091 --> 01:26:18,460
This is what I say,
this people that are asking,

1540
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,940
but I don't know if this is accurate
but it helps the same way as Xanax gets

1541
01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:23,260
into your fat molecules.

1542
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:27,610
It helps getting caffeine into your fat
mute molecule so it stays longer. Well,

1543
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,473
this is the idea

1544
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:28,921
behind it.

1545
01:26:28,921 --> 01:26:33,921
The idea behind it is that you blend
the butter and you blend the MCT oil and

1546
01:26:34,621 --> 01:26:39,000
those healthy fats combined
with the coffee and then
it gives you more of a slow

1547
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:43,080
release aspect of caffeine because
your body has to absorb it slower. Now,

1548
01:26:43,081 --> 01:26:45,900
some people dispute that.
Alan Alan Aragon,

1549
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:49,170
who I'm going to eventually get on
the podcast. Very, very bright guy.

1550
01:26:49,171 --> 01:26:52,830
Very interesting guy. Says
there's no proof that it, it,

1551
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:57,810
it burns it slower that way, but
for me personally, I find my,

1552
01:26:57,811 --> 01:27:01,650
at least anecdotal evidence based on
personal experience is that when I drink

1553
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,680
that bulletproof coffee style of coffee
called the Robb Wolf blend caught

1554
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,320
whatever you want, it lasts longer. The,

1555
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:14,340
the buzz last longer and there's no crash
because it feels like my body's slowly

1556
01:27:14,341 --> 01:27:18,750
digesting all the fats and it, I don't
know, it just works. I know I don't,

1557
01:27:18,751 --> 01:27:20,370
but I'm not a scientist.
I'm not a doctor.

1558
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,820
I don't think it's a placebo effect
because when I drink black coffee,

1559
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:26,130
which we do all the time here as well,
sometimes Jamie,

1560
01:27:26,131 --> 01:27:28,560
we'll just make the black coffee.
I feel like I crash.

1561
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,770
It goes up and it goes down and I think
it just gets in your bloodstream quicker,

1562
01:27:31,771 --> 01:27:36,390
isn't it? It's not attached to fats. I
love it. I love the buttery on my top lip.

1563
01:27:36,391 --> 01:27:40,350
When you can get like it tastes
good, tastes fucking good. I like it.

1564
01:27:40,351 --> 01:27:44,310
For breakfast, I w I mean, look, I made
sure that I get a lot of nutrients.

1565
01:27:44,311 --> 01:27:47,700
I make sure I get a lot of
healthy leafy green vegetables.

1566
01:27:47,701 --> 01:27:52,470
I eat a lot of spinach and
Kale and Broccoli and all
kinds of, I think it's very,

1567
01:27:52,471 --> 01:27:56,190
that's one of the most important things
to get is get healthy plant based

1568
01:27:56,191 --> 01:27:56,761
nutrients.

1569
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:59,430
I think it's one of the things that's
missing from a lot of people's diets.

1570
01:27:59,431 --> 01:28:03,570
You don't give it a fresh vegetables,
but you know, sometimes I'll,

1571
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:07,470
I won't eat until like, you know, two or
three in the afternoon and the whole day.

1572
01:28:07,471 --> 01:28:09,930
All haven't you haven't
eaten since noon today? Yeah,

1573
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:14,490
I haven't had bulletproof coffee and um,
I had a protein I worked out too.

1574
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,190
I worked out and then,
uh, maybe two minutes.

1575
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,180
I think the, I did battle
ropes. Oh, did you really?

1576
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:24,200
Like you're riding an elephant.
Yeah.

1577
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:28,530
Is Con bomb Alexander the Great,
speaking of getting his con,

1578
01:28:28,531 --> 01:28:30,230
I watched the 300,

1579
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:34,190
the new 300 John Wayne played
Gingiss calm the movie. Oh yes,

1580
01:28:34,191 --> 01:28:37,220
I did played it.
We played it on the podcast before.

1581
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:42,590
Big [inaudible] dog shit. So
sorry to interrupt. No, it's okay.

1582
01:28:42,591 --> 01:28:45,620
It's so bad. It's worth
talking about. It's amazing.

1583
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:47,690
Maybe we could pull it up again.
Pull it up again John.

1584
01:28:47,691 --> 01:28:52,460
Wayne is Gaviscon cause it's so fucking
stupid. There are a lot of Asians around.

1585
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,130
How that new thing a hundred
though. Terrible. Oh really?
It's a hunk of shit. Ooh.

1586
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,520
How about snow piercer what's that?

1587
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,980
I've heard it's one that Jamie
was telling me about. Yeah, no

1588
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,813
I haven't seen it.

1589
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:04,190
They they they,

1590
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:09,220
it is the first product that is now
proving the video on demand is going to be

1591
01:29:10,581 --> 01:29:12,110
better than movie theaters because,

1592
01:29:12,111 --> 01:29:15,860
I mean think about how pimp you've
making your place to watch movies.

1593
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,790
I mean mine is, I, I fucking lock
down my man cave surround sound.

1594
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:23,240
I got post screens going so I can go
like this and it's Kinda like, uh, like,

1595
01:29:23,241 --> 01:29:24,980
you know, I feel like I'm
getting sucker punched picture.

1596
01:29:24,981 --> 01:29:28,940
You was like a two by four that you slap
under. Don't like one of those fucking,

1597
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:33,970
you know how they lock up like a castle
door along with a big fucking bolt.

1598
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:38,300
Oh, I love it. I put my Aye.
Aye. Aye. Aye. It's my favorite.

1599
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,300
You should have a red light that goes
off when your wife needs to get ahold of

1600
01:29:41,301 --> 01:29:44,080
you in the, we should get ahold of you.
We have walkie talkies and they call me.

1601
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:49,000
They call me papa bear. Goldilocks.
Papa bear. Goldilocks. Rapala. No,

1602
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:52,430
you're such a maniac on my donor.
My daughter's talking on walkie talkie.

1603
01:29:52,431 --> 01:29:56,600
Lango copy that. Uh, that's so funny.
Go for it. Go for Goldie locks.

1604
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:02,450
So ridiculous about that Lucy movie. That
looks awesome. It looks like dog shit.

1605
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,420
Yeah, it's the same thing over
and over again. How many movies

1606
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:10,350
take where someone takes something and
they become superhuman? You know? Oh,

1607
01:30:10,351 --> 01:30:13,140
it's fucking limitless. It's
Lucy. It's this. It's that.

1608
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:14,370
You know what's going to happen?

1609
01:30:14,371 --> 01:30:17,740
She's going to win and then it'll
probably like wear off at the end and she

1610
01:30:17,741 --> 01:30:20,850
become a normal chick and
she'll get knocked up and
live in the suburbs and then

1611
01:30:20,851 --> 01:30:23,850
the CIA will drive by her house real
slow just to make sure that she's not

1612
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:26,040
fucking flipping cars through
the air with a brand anymore.

1613
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,630
But she'll be writing a blog.
Yeah.

1614
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:31,080
You remember how like the
Bradley Cooper movie limitless.

1615
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,940
Fascinating to the end. They wrapped
it up with a fucking bow of shit.

1616
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:39,750
It's like the way they ended it with
so dumb that he like figured out how to

1617
01:30:39,751 --> 01:30:43,590
fucking fix it all on his own so
it doesn't like how, how did he,

1618
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:48,710
how did he solve the one major problem
with this stuff that it wore off and

1619
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:50,490
fucked you up after it was over?

1620
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:54,340
Are you ready for the greatest movie
ever? Okay. Uh, with your kids.

1621
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:58,160
Have you seen the Lego movie? Yes.
Amazing. The greatest fucking movie.

1622
01:30:58,690 --> 01:30:59,860
Everything is awesome.

1623
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:07,210
Move for adults. Kids
enjoying. Yeah. Let's see.

1624
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:12,040
Gaviscon John Wayne is tag. Oh, they
made a preview of the recut version.

1625
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,450
They tried to make it cooler

1626
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:18,250
and civilization. Ancestors, that's fine.

1627
01:31:18,251 --> 01:31:20,860
Dying be without bloodshed.
The cal bad. The set looks,

1628
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:24,580
my spirit may forever counseling,
protect the crates,

1629
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:27,410
all fat and shit.

1630
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:37,070
Hot. Listen to me. There are
moments where wisdom Jim Oga,

1631
01:31:37,071 --> 01:31:40,070
then I listened to you.
I'm Oka and are moments for action.

1632
01:31:40,071 --> 01:31:41,270
Then I listened to my blood.

1633
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:46,440
I feel less tired or a
woman is from a backhander.

1634
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:53,110
I've taken you over white board ty and
I take your dowry tomorrow and our Gut,

1635
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:57,750
I make gift of it. Dwayne
con. Oh my God, please.

1636
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:02,540
My strength in CG of Wang Con city.
Hi

1637
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:17,060
[inaudible].

1638
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,370
First of all,
how bad an actor was John Wayne,

1639
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:27,790
apparently all you had to be as
white back then. Yeah, that's it.

1640
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:29,080
It's fucking terrible.

1641
01:32:29,081 --> 01:32:33,610
I mean he did remotely sound
Mongolian Talk Mongolia.

1642
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:38,800
But isn't it also weird that that was
like essentially like you talking about

1643
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:41,020
like was it probably like the
sixties right? They made that

1644
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:47,170
closer to the gang con days than today,
right?

1645
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,620
It's 2014 obviously that was closer.

1646
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:55,370
I mean not a lot closer but close
enough where it's measurable. Yeah,

1647
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:59,500
but so far off of what the
Mongols were really like.

1648
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:03,610
Whereas today you could never
make that movie like that.

1649
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:08,200
Could you imagine like let's say if Ryan
Gosling wanted to play kingus Khan and

1650
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:11,350
he was just fucking sleepwalking through
it, just like that John went click,

1651
01:33:11,351 --> 01:33:14,650
you'd be like,
what a fucking piece of shit is this?

1652
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:18,340
But for whatever reason
where people dumber, then

1653
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:22,310
definitely and no one, no one had
any reference for who Genghis Khan,

1654
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:26,010
but how would they dumb or then if they
had already invented the atomic bomb,

1655
01:33:26,011 --> 01:33:27,360
we couldn't invent the atomic pop.

1656
01:33:27,361 --> 01:33:32,340
So someone in the 1940s Oppenheimer was
way fucking smarter than anyone in this

1657
01:33:32,341 --> 01:33:36,780
room. I'm sure Oppenheimer did not want
to see that movie. I'm sure it was like,

1658
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:38,430
wait, you have to do is Asian. Right?

1659
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,180
But like think about how many geniuses
they're work Teslow was the beginning of

1660
01:33:42,181 --> 01:33:46,440
the 20th century. You know
that you're, you're talking
about super, super geniuses,

1661
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:47,790
incredibly brilliant people,

1662
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:53,090
but yet the general population would
accept a hunk of shit like that.

1663
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:56,160
I mean that is a really bad movie.

1664
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:59,560
This is a theory that Duncan
I got into and I had the,

1665
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:03,200
I had an idea and I asked Duncan
about it and Duncan took his,

1666
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:04,600
I took the idea to the next level,

1667
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:08,560
but the idea was I was trying
to Google what Christ's Iq was.

1668
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:11,500
Let's see if what he got on the
Iq test and it's zero it within,

1669
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:15,220
never had accused back then
knowing I never didn't exist.
How about Jesus Christ?

1670
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:17,230
So,
but that was like,

1671
01:34:17,231 --> 01:34:21,130
I wonder if like Jesus was smarter than
the average person are dumber than the

1672
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:21,964
average person.

1673
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:26,530
And Duncan brought about premise he had
were that everyone was basically like a

1674
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:30,010
mentally challenged except for
Jesus who was the first person.

1675
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:31,630
So it was like something about Mary,

1676
01:34:31,631 --> 01:34:33,850
like you had basically visit the baseball
behind your ear and they're like,

1677
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,050
here's Morgan beans. But, uh, I
think that was Dunkin's theory.

1678
01:34:38,051 --> 01:34:40,270
I'm fucking ruin conversations
I have with people.

1679
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:43,420
Don't get hard on yourself too. You
always do these seven guys right there,

1680
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:46,780
but you were doing great. But, uh,
but I think that, I think that,

1681
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:50,320
I would guess that based on the internet
or the information that we have,

1682
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:55,770
our level of basic intelligence has
increased exponentially from 1960.

1683
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,250
Well,
I don't know if our intelligence has,

1684
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,810
but our knowledge has, that's
right. Yeah. I mean the, the, the,

1685
01:35:01,811 --> 01:35:06,410
the capacity to hold information
seems to be the same.

1686
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:11,360
That's why we run into issues like there's
an issue with that. You know, the, um,

1687
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:15,830
the, the Dunbar number, like 150 people,

1688
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:19,160
they keep 150 people in your,
in your mind, that's what you,

1689
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:22,610
your memories capable of holding in
their hundred 50 people that you have

1690
01:35:22,611 --> 01:35:25,130
intimate relationships with,
that you're friends with.

1691
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:27,710
Anything more than 150
shit gets really weird.

1692
01:35:27,711 --> 01:35:29,630
You run out of hard
drive space and it's a,

1693
01:35:29,631 --> 01:35:34,520
this is a scientific number and it's based
on the capacity to recognize how many

1694
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:39,050
people are in a tribe and they average
tribe. When human beings were, you know,

1695
01:35:39,051 --> 01:35:42,620
coming up was like 50 to a hundred,
150 people maximum.

1696
01:35:42,621 --> 01:35:44,510
That's all he needed to have.
Now,

1697
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:48,140
especially if you're a guy like Bert
Kreischer traveling all over the world

1698
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:52,070
doing stand up comedy, how many fucking
people have you met? God dammit, Dude,

1699
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:55,400
you've met thousands and
thousands of people and if
you might run into some dude,

1700
01:35:55,401 --> 01:35:57,890
you might do a show in Australia and
you run into that dude and he like, Hey,

1701
01:35:57,891 --> 01:36:01,080
remember we talked last year?
And you're like, no, I've,

1702
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,250
does that freak you out when
someone says, Oh yeah, we hung out.

1703
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:08,210
Like we worked on a TV show together for
a year and you're like flat line, like,

1704
01:36:08,211 --> 01:36:11,540
you know what really freaks me out when
I can't remember it. I can't remember.

1705
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:15,680
I can't remember. I can't remember
it at all. And then, oh yeah.

1706
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:19,640
And then it starts appearing in my
memory and then I'm like, where was that?

1707
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:22,470
Where was that? I'm just pulling
it out now and like, God,

1708
01:36:22,471 --> 01:36:24,200
I totally forgot about that.

1709
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:29,560
I've met people again like after having
met them before and then all of a sudden

1710
01:36:30,381 --> 01:36:32,570
the whole evening where I met them like,
Oh yeah,

1711
01:36:32,571 --> 01:36:36,300
we were talking to Doug and he told
you that thing. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1712
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:38,750
But before they like a stranger,

1713
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:43,640
there were a total stranger until
whatever it was started reappearing in the

1714
01:36:43,641 --> 01:36:46,700
back of my retrieving your
data back from the cloud. Yeah,

1715
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:49,010
I don't get it then that's
the next Lucy movie.

1716
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:50,240
What if they didn't make her smarter?

1717
01:36:50,241 --> 01:36:52,580
They just increased her hard drive
so she can remember everyone.

1718
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:53,600
That's why she prayed them.

1719
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:57,170
The basis of the movie as she's using
more of her brain said like the chemical

1720
01:36:57,171 --> 01:36:57,940
let you open.

1721
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:01,190
That's one of the reasons why that movie
is going to suck because that premise

1722
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:02,870
has already been disproven by science.

1723
01:37:02,871 --> 01:37:07,010
It's not that you only use a certain
percentage of your brain. That's not true.

1724
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,440
Like this idea of humans only use 10%
of their brain. They said that in the,

1725
01:37:10,441 --> 01:37:12,610
in the preview. I was
like, no, they don't. They,

1726
01:37:12,611 --> 01:37:16,550
they're just starting to understand what
parts of the brain are responsible for

1727
01:37:16,551 --> 01:37:19,370
what functions. And one of the
things that they're doing this,

1728
01:37:19,371 --> 01:37:21,020
this is really interesting shit.

1729
01:37:21,021 --> 01:37:24,910
I think it's called transcranial TTC,

1730
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:26,060
d something or another.

1731
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:30,750
They're putting electrical stimulation
on various aspects or various, uh,

1732
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:33,440
points of, of this, of your skull.

1733
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:38,710
They're putting electrodes on your skull
and they're inducing like this state by

1734
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:43,010
emitting electricity and it feels
like mosquitoes are biting you.

1735
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,390
There's a great,
um,

1736
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:49,310
episode of this podcast I
listened to all the time.

1737
01:37:49,311 --> 01:37:53,270
Radio lab, a recent one. I think the
most recent one in fact is about this.

1738
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:57,730
And this woman went through
this, uh, this, they're,

1739
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:02,640
they're learning that it can increase
your capacity to learn, like dramatically,

1740
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,530
dramatically and provable.

1741
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:08,820
So this woman went through
this thing where she went
through sniper training. So,

1742
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:13,190
uh, in this sniper training scenario,
they a first you'd do it sober. They,

1743
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:16,410
they take you through this
thing. There's a, you're at a,

1744
01:38:16,411 --> 01:38:20,250
a checkpoint like in Iraq, you
know, it's all video simulation.

1745
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:24,690
A bomb blows up and the suicide bombers
are running at you with bomb vests on

1746
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,020
and they're shooting guns at you and
you gotta figure out who's who and pick

1747
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:31,860
them off. Well, the first time she
did it, it was super frustrating.

1748
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:36,810
She got like three out of 20, and she
just kept and kept getting fucked up.

1749
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:38,340
It was driving her crazy.
He was driving her nuts.

1750
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:42,330
Then they put the electrodes on,
they juiced to brain,

1751
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:46,830
they put electrodes on her brain and her,
uh, the, the side of her head and on her,

1752
01:38:46,831 --> 01:38:50,070
uh, left arm somehow or
another, like her right brain,

1753
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,460
the right side of her head and her
left arm. And then she was like,

1754
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:55,880
this isn't going to do anything.
She didn't feel any different. She,

1755
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:58,320
she said she felt like a
metallic taste in their mouth,

1756
01:38:58,321 --> 01:39:00,480
like she had just licked an
aluminum can or something like that.

1757
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:04,680
Then went through the thing and she
said everything moved in slow motion.

1758
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:08,370
She said 20 minutes went by in
three minutes. When it was over,

1759
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,000
she couldn't believe it was over. She's
like, how was it over? She's like, it's,

1760
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:15,420
it's only been three minutes. And
they like, no, look at the clock.

1761
01:39:15,421 --> 01:39:17,160
She looked at the clock.
20 minutes has gone by.

1762
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:19,050
She was a hundred percent accurate,

1763
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:24,320
so from three out of 20 she got 20 out
of 20 the second time and she thought it

1764
01:39:24,571 --> 01:39:25,440
only took three minutes.

1765
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,060
She just went through this thing like
she was an expert and they were like,

1766
01:39:30,061 --> 01:39:32,130
she became like an assassin. Yeah. Yeah.

1767
01:39:32,131 --> 01:39:35,160
Ohio state actually just had a guy
that was paralyzed and they've been,

1768
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:40,280
they found how to control the brain for
him to actually a move for your first

1769
01:39:40,501 --> 01:39:42,420
time or something like that. Yeah.
That's different. Yeah. I mean,

1770
01:39:42,421 --> 01:39:45,240
we're talking different, we're talking
that's, that's still fascinating.

1771
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:48,990
But this is through the average person.
This is not people that are paralyzed.

1772
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:49,650
The average person,

1773
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:54,510
they can increase your capacity to learn
by using this transdermal stimulation.

1774
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:58,560
Transcranial direct stimulation,
I think it's called.

1775
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,790
I got, I got a serious injury
head injury I had in college.

1776
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:03,710
I got knocked unconscious.
What happened?

1777
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:08,450
You've got to fight and a dude kind
of fucked me up. I wrote a song,

1778
01:40:08,451 --> 01:40:10,430
a comic song and he
didn't find it very funny.

1779
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,980
So I beat you up and knocked her
unconscious. My good friend too.

1780
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:16,640
He was my really good friend. Yeah, he was
older than I was. He was, uh, he was old.

1781
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:19,970
He was like two years old, three years
older than I was. What was it about,

1782
01:40:19,971 --> 01:40:23,420
what was the song about?
About our fraternity? I sang
a song about a fraternity,

1783
01:40:23,421 --> 01:40:26,780
like lighthearted song making fun of all
the brothers and that were older than

1784
01:40:26,781 --> 01:40:30,710
me obviously, and he didn't find it
funny and so, but I was as friends,

1785
01:40:30,711 --> 01:40:33,290
so I was like, we're not going to
fight. But then I was, I was wrong

1786
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:39,380
and he grabbed me and like suplex
to me and, and like, like you know,

1787
01:40:39,381 --> 01:40:42,380
like the, like you would like if you're
going to throw someone like full,

1788
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:45,770
you know what I mean? Like over
your shoulder backwards, let him,

1789
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:48,470
I let him on my head and I was,
I was out and then I came to,

1790
01:40:48,471 --> 01:40:52,400
I was really confused and then I came to,

1791
01:40:52,401 --> 01:40:53,650
and he was on of me

1792
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,320
trying to say, cause I think I would
swallow my tongue or something.

1793
01:40:56,321 --> 01:40:58,990
I'm not certain. But then
I, but then I got lost.

1794
01:40:58,991 --> 01:41:02,560
I walked around campus and I got lost
and I was really confused as let you go.

1795
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:05,650
I was in maternity, it was, it was
a fight and then I just walked away.

1796
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:09,340
Like I just walked away. It was
during exams and so I just walked out.

1797
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:12,610
So your fraternity brothers didn't take
you to a fucking doctor who's there?

1798
01:41:12,611 --> 01:41:15,100
You got knocked unconscious. He
was the only one there. It was,

1799
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:18,070
he didn't take you to a doctor?
No. No. Well he just beat me up.

1800
01:41:18,071 --> 01:41:21,010
I don't think he was concerned about
my wellbeing fraternity in Florida.

1801
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:26,260
Did you stay friends with this guy? No.
You should've called the cops. Uh, yeah.

1802
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:31,190
Well, yeah, there was a lot. I mean it,
long story short fucking asshole. Yeah.

1803
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:35,570
So, um, he uh, so I, I went to the
hospital and I had some headaches.

1804
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:38,290
I had like minor amnesia,

1805
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:40,690
like meaning I had a hard
time remembering some shit.

1806
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:43,750
They asked me where I went to school and
I was like, Jesuit was my first answer.

1807
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:46,780
That was my high school and my roommate
at the time was there and he was like,

1808
01:41:46,781 --> 01:41:49,500
oh fuck. And so then, uh,

1809
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,820
I did a bunch of testing
and the doctors were like,

1810
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,800
I think everything's going to be fine.
I think it'd be fine.

1811
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:58,850
I think you just got your Bell Rung and
uh, Ms Back when they used the fifties,

1812
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:03,250
when, when was this
going on? This is 1992.

1813
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:06,700
Did they not understand how fucking
dangerous concussions are? Not at all.

1814
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,350
That jazz me crazy man.

1815
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,890
People that have a lack of understanding
about head injuries try it drives me

1816
01:42:11,891 --> 01:42:16,810
fucking nuts. He could go to a doctor.
There wasn't, it was Tallahassee, Florida,

1817
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:21,020
probably hoping you're dying to get
rid of him. So many fucking my mind.

1818
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:25,630
My Dad's really, uh, really nervous kind
of guy. And so when I went to Tampa,

1819
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:28,660
I got like the thing where they put
you in the thing and the cat scan or

1820
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:29,350
whatever.

1821
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:32,950
And then they did this thing where they
put electrodes all over my head to all

1822
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:33,401
over my head.

1823
01:42:33,401 --> 01:42:37,180
And then they put this light in
front of my face and it flashed like,

1824
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:40,360
it was like the rainbow color, but it was
just, it was just going like different,

1825
01:42:40,361 --> 01:42:42,700
like pulses and like different things.

1826
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,260
And you had just sit there
with your eyes closed,

1827
01:42:44,261 --> 01:42:46,420
but you could see it clear as
fuck with your eyes closed.

1828
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:48,220
And then they did a test in your brain.

1829
01:42:48,221 --> 01:42:50,410
They did reading comprehension and they're
like, I think are going to be fine.

1830
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:54,520
He just had to, you know, you got a
concussion and you were out. You'll,

1831
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,500
you'll come back. That guy's a piece of
shit, man. Yeah. Suplex you and your head.

1832
01:42:59,501 --> 01:43:03,760
You know that that is so fucking dangerous
to do that to someone on the street.

1833
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:08,230
It's so dangerous. That's the number
one way to people die in street fights.

1834
01:43:08,231 --> 01:43:10,270
You know, they fall and hit
their head on the street. Yeah.

1835
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:13,560
There's a guy in college that punched
the guy and knocked him unconscious and

1836
01:43:13,561 --> 01:43:18,200
the guy landed on a, uh, on a, on a
parking curb, a parking thing, and,

1837
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:21,550
and died. That happened to a guy
that Kevin James used to work with.

1838
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,530
Kevin James was a bouncer.

1839
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:26,470
He worked with this other bouncer and
the bouncer punched the guy in the head.

1840
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:31,420
The guy got knocked unconscious, fell
back, hit his head on a curb, dad, fuck,

1841
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,040
it's a course.
I mean,

1842
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:36,820
think about what it would be like if
you hit someone in the head with a curb

1843
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:40,720
stone. Yeah. You know, going 30 miles an
hour, just smash him in the head. Well,

1844
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:44,680
that's what it's like when you fall
backwards and you hit the curb and you're,

1845
01:43:44,681 --> 01:43:44,980
you're,

1846
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:48,880
you're basically getting your fucking
brain bashed in with all your body weight.

1847
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:52,310
It's super dangerous.
So this dickhead

1848
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:55,670
fucking whatever. I'm sorry. Yeah, it's
okay. So, so what happened from then on?

1849
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,620
No, nothing. I, I recovered.
They were like, don't, uh,
the doctor was like, Shit,

1850
01:44:00,621 --> 01:44:05,300
you stay away from booze and any like
pod or anything in that last couple of

1851
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:08,820
hours. Not even, I think that first
night I got drunk, I was like, I think

1852
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:15,440
I'm way more drones,
like just fucking candle concussions rule.

1853
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,040
But uh, but yeah, it was, I was fine. I'm,

1854
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:22,180
yeah, that was fine. This, um,
episode of Radio Lab, if Ben,

1855
01:44:22,181 --> 01:44:24,890
nobody wants to listen to,
it's called nine volt Nirvana.

1856
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:26,210
And if you've never heard radio,

1857
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:29,960
radio lab before is my favorite
podcast right now. I really enjoy it.

1858
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:34,100
It's really good. It's so, so well
made. And they, each one of them,

1859
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:37,280
it takes a long time to make once they
only put one out like every few weeks or

1860
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:40,370
so. But it's really good
stuff. Really good stuff.

1861
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,160
But it's all about this transcranial,

1862
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:47,470
it's called transcranial
electrical stimulation. And, um,

1863
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:52,490
if you just look up transcranial
direct current stimulation,

1864
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:56,420
um, there are many, many articles
about it online and many,

1865
01:44:56,421 --> 01:45:01,130
many different studies that have been
done. Really fucking fascinating stuff.

1866
01:45:01,131 --> 01:45:03,140
But if you're learning something,

1867
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:06,950
apparently there's a bunch of dudes have
done like do it yourself versions of it

1868
01:45:06,951 --> 01:45:08,120
too with a,

1869
01:45:08,121 --> 01:45:12,470
you can apparently you could build your
own transcranial electrical stimulation

1870
01:45:12,471 --> 01:45:16,970
device. Uh, uh, with some shit
that you buy from radio shack.

1871
01:45:17,050 --> 01:45:20,960
I'm fucking really make myself gay or oh,

1872
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,840
you mean get it right.

1873
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,170
It's like Ghostbusters at the beginning
when he has all those things on his head.

1874
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:30,060
There was a video

1875
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,200
or,
or there was an article might be bullshit,

1876
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,950
but a guy was a rugby player who got
knocked out and he got a concussion and

1877
01:45:35,951 --> 01:45:36,970
turn gay.
I don't believe that

1878
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:40,330
we've talked about that.
Remember this pit, the before
pictures. He's like, Hi guys,

1879
01:45:40,331 --> 01:45:45,040
I'm playing rugby.
He looked totally straight.

1880
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:49,870
Totally straight. Looks like cause
whatever it is, rock Hudson looked like it

1881
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:55,510
did. I bet. I bet so many dudes
were tricked into sucking his dick.

1882
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:59,410
He has the king of the among goals.
Tell you now rock.

1883
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:03,760
Yeah. How many dudes were tricked in?
Well, that's the Travolta move, right?

1884
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:07,900
Isn't that the idea? I've heard stories
about guys we know. Nevermind. Hey,

1885
01:46:07,901 --> 01:46:10,460
keep going. Why stop now? What
are you saying? I've heard it.

1886
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:15,660
I've heard stories of like of like famous
people that Scientologists maybe no,

1887
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:21,780
but famous people who have gotten dudes
that are like young comics to suck their

1888
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:25,210
dicks. Oh yeah. And then they're like, I
don't know what happened. I was telling.

1889
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:27,260
Sure. Yeah, that's totally true. Yeah.

1890
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:30,260
This is something that's straight
guys get a kick out of doing that or,

1891
01:46:30,261 --> 01:46:34,060
or gay guys rather get a kick out of
getting straight guys to suck their dick.

1892
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:35,730
I was a friend that

1893
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:39,610
I'm used to work at. Um, uh, he was on um,

1894
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:42,700
a fear factor and a couple of shows
that I did. He was a good guy.

1895
01:46:42,701 --> 01:46:47,701
He was a wardrobe guy and he was do's
long gang to get big Mexican gay guy.

1896
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,320
Awesome dude. Um, but anyway,

1897
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:57,000
he would tell me all the time that like,
like guys would get drunk,

1898
01:46:57,001 --> 01:47:01,530
like straight guys who get drunk and wind
up blowing them. And I was like, really?

1899
01:47:01,531 --> 01:47:05,940
He goes, yeah, we're having me blow
them. I was like, really? And he goes to,

1900
01:47:05,941 --> 01:47:08,220
they would always say, I've never done
this before. I go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1901
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:14,640
Like I don't, you know,
then, then the question is

1902
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:18,880
where they really straight all
along or were they, you know,

1903
01:47:18,881 --> 01:47:21,940
were they just the alcohol
brought out the gain? Um,

1904
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:24,040
they were really gay and they
just didn't want to admit it.

1905
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:26,780
That's, I have a joke about
that, that I'm not homophobic.

1906
01:47:26,781 --> 01:47:30,140
I'm a Homo Kondracke like I'm comfortable
if your game's free one night you'll

1907
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:33,260
get me drunk and trick me into it
and I'll like it. I'll be like, aw,

1908
01:47:33,261 --> 01:47:36,380
this is my jam. Tom Ziglar and I
went out with a gay dude one night.

1909
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:38,930
Our trainer was gay and he was like,
why don't you guys come out with us?

1910
01:47:38,931 --> 01:47:42,730
And Tom and I were like, like, and he's
like, well, go to gay clubs. Tom was like,

1911
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:46,010
you want to go? I was like, fuck yeah.
Why don't you guys come out with us?

1912
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:49,940
We're going to go to gay clubs and Tom
and I went and like Tom dressed like

1913
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:51,940
youth spruced up.

1914
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:57,170
Did he really collared shirt
on. I'm like Tom. And he's like,

1915
01:47:57,171 --> 01:47:58,370
what were ms can be jeans.

1916
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:03,680
I'm wearing skinny jeans and a collared
shirt and shoes. It was fucking his wolf.

1917
01:48:03,681 --> 01:48:05,990
Shoot.
Whatever those big bear paws fit into.

1918
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:10,160
But Tonya has so much fucking fun.

1919
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:12,720
We Sat,

1920
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,280
we sat together drinking like the gay
strengths that tastes awesome by the way.

1921
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,510
What's the gain strength like a
like cosmos and Pina coladas. Nope.

1922
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:24,070
Delicious am Tom and I were
like, no beers. We're not,

1923
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:26,990
we don't have to do shots and left.
It's like a like a sex on the beach.

1924
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:28,700
We had the best fucking time.

1925
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:31,380
Well you remember Scott Kennedy and he's
like the street straight as gay guy of

1926
01:48:31,381 --> 01:48:33,690
all time. Yeah. Yeah. He's gay as fuck.

1927
01:48:33,691 --> 01:48:36,930
But you would think he's like the
straight beer drink in football fan.

1928
01:48:37,190 --> 01:48:41,220
I always had a football Jersey
on. He died, died a few years ago.

1929
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:41,970
I don't remember what,

1930
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:44,450
I think he died in his sleep and then he
has sleep apnea or something like that.

1931
01:48:44,451 --> 01:48:48,570
He's a big guy. His stroke, I think
Justin Martin Dale Party. What's that?

1932
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:51,330
I didn't know Justin Martin. Dale is gay
for like the first six months. I knew.

1933
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,780
How is that even possible? I
never saw him drunk. I think he,

1934
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:57,880
when he's not, when he's sober,
he, how much does watch them walk?

1935
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:00,660
Guess Scott is fuck Scott Kennedy that

1936
01:49:02,990 --> 01:49:04,610
Scott Kennedy and I
were drinking one night.

1937
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,070
I kind of wish I could remember
how this story exactly went,

1938
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,850
but we were sitting drinking
in Sacramento and uh,

1939
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:15,100
and I saw this dude walked by. That was
just a mess. I was like, God. And I'm,

1940
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:18,890
but I wasn't thinking. I was
like, can you imagine being him?

1941
01:49:18,891 --> 01:49:22,640
Like having to have his life and I,
it's calculus that doesn't turn you on.

1942
01:49:22,641 --> 01:49:26,260
And I go turn me on. And Scott goes, one
man's trash is another man's treasure.

1943
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:33,280
One man's trash is we're
fubu jerseys or foot football

1944
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:36,010
jerseys. Well, one of
the other, yeah. Yeah,

1945
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,290
I gaydar doesn't really work
well with comedians though.

1946
01:49:38,291 --> 01:49:39,550
Cause if he'd hang out
at the comedy store,

1947
01:49:39,551 --> 01:49:42,400
you would say half the people were gay.
But they're not supposedly, you know,

1948
01:49:42,401 --> 01:49:45,880
there's just the large groups of people
that cause their comics and they all

1949
01:49:45,881 --> 01:49:48,010
know each other.
They all of act gay or the

1950
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,150
normal. What are you talking about?
I never explained so Benji's gay,

1951
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:56,110
you know Benji, I would think Benji's gay,
but he's not. And Tony, perfect example.

1952
01:49:56,111 --> 01:49:58,840
I would think Tony's gay, but
he's not. You would think,
oh Tony Asher, who was gay.

1953
01:49:58,841 --> 01:50:03,510
Why? Just cause he's small. I mean I guess
you could hold them down and fucking,

1954
01:50:03,511 --> 01:50:07,060
no, no, no. I think it's just like little
things. That's how he carries himself.

1955
01:50:07,061 --> 01:50:10,180
You know, like a lot of people like
he's like, he has a joke about it.

1956
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:12,670
He has a gay face, you know
it. Well he's very small,

1957
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:17,590
but I wouldn't think he was gay. I
don't know. He's just against maybe,

1958
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:21,700
well how he dresses.
He's personally to be cardigan thing.

1959
01:50:21,701 --> 01:50:24,670
It's a very funny thing.
The cardigan thing,

1960
01:50:24,671 --> 01:50:26,650
like are you remember
the Ari's Cardigan phase?

1961
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:29,350
He was giving me a hard time about
fanny packs. I'm like, bitch,

1962
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:31,150
I never said a word during
your cardigan phase.

1963
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:35,500
What about Ari's like Bozo the clown
phase where he just shaved like hit like a

1964
01:50:35,501 --> 01:50:39,700
bald spot but left the hair around the
side of his head. Do that one day though.

1965
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,100
Oh, it was that one day. I
thought it was a while. No,

1966
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:46,120
I remember he grew a Hitler
mustache. Yeah, that was
weird. He shaved. He's Jewish,

1967
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:49,370
I think if anybody's allowed to
rock a Hitler mustache. Oh yeah.

1968
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:54,160
Remember when he had to wear his hat on
the side of his head during that time we

1969
01:50:54,161 --> 01:50:57,800
had like a Hitler mustache and then he
had a small house, like a beanie beanie.

1970
01:50:57,910 --> 01:50:59,770
He wore sideways.
Yeah.

1971
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:03,900
He's being silly or is that an
interesting fucking guy? Okay,

1972
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:05,590
a real kick out of that guy.

1973
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:09,370
He was the first one that
proved he h he in a weird way,

1974
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:12,340
kind of changed the way I hang out with
people and me and him talked about this.

1975
01:51:12,341 --> 01:51:13,750
A lot of people have heard me say this,

1976
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:16,540
but [inaudible] was the
first person that I saw.

1977
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:20,320
I saw the amazing racist and I really
liked it and I went up to him at a comedy

1978
01:51:20,321 --> 01:51:23,710
club and I was like in Tripoli did the
same thing to me. And I said, hey man,

1979
01:51:23,711 --> 01:51:26,320
I saw your amazing racist. I really
liked it. I think you're really funny.

1980
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:29,590
And it was like the, the tension between
two comics who didn't know each other,

1981
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:30,790
just was no longer there.

1982
01:51:30,791 --> 01:51:34,210
And then we became friends and it was
like all you have to do is really just be

1983
01:51:34,211 --> 01:51:36,550
nice to people and people
are nice right back.

1984
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,820
What do you mean? Like, is
that confusing? Yeah. Like,

1985
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:41,820
well I know how to find water.

1986
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,910
You Rub a stick on a rock
and it makes it water.

1987
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,490
No, but like sometimes with
comics it's like there is this,

1988
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:51,210
like if you don't know a comic then
you're like kind of Kentucky about it.

1989
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,310
And so like you're,
yeah,

1990
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:57,540
there's a lot of comedy and like think
of like the different scenes that go on

1991
01:51:57,541 --> 01:52:01,110
and everyone was like, ah, yeah.
Like just a, that kind of shit.

1992
01:52:01,111 --> 01:52:03,830
But I saw Ari and Sam Aaa did the
same thing. He came to me one night.

1993
01:52:03,831 --> 01:52:05,610
He was like, I really like that
joke years. I was like, oh my God,

1994
01:52:05,611 --> 01:52:10,390
we're friends now. I like you.
You like me. I like me. Yeah, some

1995
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:13,270
comics definitely. I'm a standoffish
thing about other comics,

1996
01:52:13,271 --> 01:52:16,090
but you know Tony Hinchcliffe and I
were talking about that the difference

1997
01:52:16,091 --> 01:52:20,950
between the nineties when I started out
at the comedy store in [inaudible] 94

1998
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:24,320
there was no comradery there.
It was, it was all for,

1999
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:27,940
it was like this weird,
everybody was out for themselves.

2000
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:30,730
There wasn't like a lot
of pal around together.

2001
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,950
It wasn't that same
sort of an environment.

2002
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:36,910
I mean it was a lot of good comics and
people would go up and they would do sets

2003
01:52:36,911 --> 01:52:39,580
and stuff like that. And you
know, it was always kind of a,

2004
01:52:39,581 --> 01:52:41,800
an interesting place to perform,
but it was,

2005
01:52:41,801 --> 01:52:45,680
there was no like comradery amongst
comedians like there is now,

2006
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:50,180
especially like our group, that's a very,
this is a very unusual group. All of us,

2007
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:55,181
like Diaz and Ari and Dunkin and
everyone together be in pals and Cowan.

2008
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:58,100
And that shit just didn't exist.

2009
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:02,180
We w I had never known like a group
that was like that tightly knit,

2010
01:53:02,181 --> 01:53:05,390
that work together all the time to
constantly went on the road together and

2011
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:07,820
brought each other around
and then support each other.

2012
01:53:07,821 --> 01:53:11,750
And then the podcast thing came along
and everybody started doing each other's

2013
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:15,650
podcasts and supporting each other and
having each other on their podcast to

2014
01:53:15,651 --> 01:53:20,300
promote things. And that just doesn't, it
didn't exist before. It wasn't like that.

2015
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:25,310
There was people, comics were way more
standoffish. It was way less of a,

2016
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:27,200
a pal around thing.

2017
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:31,880
And one of the things that I think
that I attributed to changing it, um,

2018
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:35,440
it changed a little bit in New York.
First tough crowd changed it.

2019
01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:38,960
It kind of started to see that these
guys were buddies and they're palling

2020
01:53:38,961 --> 01:53:42,420
around together and then they
started doing ona together, like Ona,

2021
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:43,430
change it a lot.

2022
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:47,600
And then guys were hanging around at
the cellar a lot and it became like,

2023
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:49,910
there was more comradery,
you know,

2024
01:53:49,911 --> 01:53:54,170
he started to see that that more
calmer ona made a big impact.

2025
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:58,370
They made a big impact because everybody
that went on ona became kind of pals,

2026
01:53:58,850 --> 01:53:59,300
you know?

2027
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,180
I mean there's always little disputes
here and there between guys that would go

2028
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:06,830
on it. But it was like opie and Anthony
became like a place where everybody,

2029
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:11,020
you know, everybody who did it, you were
like a part of, I was like a club. Yeah,

2030
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:14,120
it's, I was, uh, I've,
I've told this to Jim,

2031
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:16,730
but I've a been a huge
ona fan for a long time.

2032
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:20,840
And those moments when like, like the
other night, the other day when they were,

2033
01:54:20,841 --> 01:54:23,960
had Pete rose on and did you hear
the one with rich Vos and Pete rose?

2034
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,390
Rich Vos was on fucking
fire. Yeah, he was,

2035
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:29,150
he was on fire and I
could not stop laughing.

2036
01:54:29,151 --> 01:54:33,340
And you think and like I know all those
guys from starting in New York, I and I,

2037
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:36,950
it is identical to how they'd hang out
with each other the best I've ever,

2038
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,970
one of my favorite moments
in standup was when, uh,

2039
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:45,050
Patrice used to heckle Voss so they'd
go to the Boston comedy club and fosters

2040
01:54:45,051 --> 01:54:47,660
get on stage and it was
almost like watching,

2041
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:51,670
it was almost like watching
Eddie and Hixon, you know,
like, like they were wrote,

2042
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:54,110
they'd roll together and put,
but Patrice would heckle him now,

2043
01:54:54,111 --> 01:54:55,460
no one knew Patrice was a comic.

2044
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:58,940
He was just a big black guy in the back
and foster get on stage and he's like,

2045
01:54:58,941 --> 01:54:59,181
man,

2046
01:54:59,181 --> 01:55:04,130
Yo teeth looked like tombstones and
boss would come out and they go back and

2047
01:55:04,131 --> 01:55:06,800
forth and it was so much fun and I was
like, this has got to do something.

2048
01:55:06,801 --> 01:55:09,620
They're going to be something they're
going to do later. But it was like,

2049
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:13,880
it was amazing and foss was so fucking
quick buy used to sit in the back and

2050
01:55:13,881 --> 01:55:15,770
just watch it.
Like watching two masters go at it.

2051
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:20,140
Yeah, Vasa very quick. And that led to
all those guys became friends from opiate.

2052
01:55:20,141 --> 01:55:21,170
Anthony that,
yeah,

2053
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:26,230
I don't know that the camaraderie between
Comedians is so important is it's huge

2054
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:29,170
because comedians on their own like,

2055
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:34,590
like I dunno this is this something that
nomadic sort of thing that comics do.

2056
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:39,370
Traveling the road being
on your own all the time.

2057
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:42,040
The guys who like really
depressed and sad,

2058
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:45,200
they'd be like never would pal around
with other comedians. They would like,

2059
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,210
they would never go on the road with
other comedians or they would take some on

2060
01:55:48,211 --> 01:55:49,170
the road that they didn't know.

2061
01:55:49,171 --> 01:55:52,230
Just like that was just a job like you
open for me and we're not really friends.

2062
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:56,520
Yeah. That, that I, that always seem to
me to be the worst way to to it. You know,

2063
01:55:56,820 --> 01:56:00,120
it's fun to be going through some shit
and call one of you guys and just be like,

2064
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:03,640
oh fuck this is this. This is
how I'm feeling. Like Joey,

2065
01:56:03,641 --> 01:56:07,140
he's Joey's might go to phone call always.
If I'm depressed I'll call Joey.

2066
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,230
Cause it's, you know, it's,

2067
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:11,050
the conversation can be no longer than
three minutes and it's going to end with

2068
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:13,470
that going to be fine. Cock sucker.
Yeah. Well I've coffee next week.

2069
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:15,300
Well it's like perfect example,

2070
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:20,301
secure segora had a terrible
show thinking Winnipeg and he uh,

2071
01:56:21,790 --> 01:56:22,623
yeah,

2072
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:27,010
he came on the podcast and talked about
it and because we know we're all comics

2073
01:56:27,011 --> 01:56:30,390
together, you know, we're laughing
and having fun just, you know,

2074
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:35,350
completely got through this terrible
tragic memory and it became hilarious.

2075
01:56:35,351 --> 01:56:37,900
It became like fun.
I love when he bombs

2076
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:41,620
so rare.
He's really fucking funny.

2077
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:44,960
It's like when it's like when you
shoot a bear with a bow and Arrow,

2078
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:46,520
but they don't know
they've been injured yet,

2079
01:56:47,150 --> 01:56:49,970
but they know that if you shot with a bow
and Arrow, I watched a lot of hunting.

2080
01:56:50,030 --> 01:56:53,540
I watched a lot of hunting videos
like I used to, I used to, if I,

2081
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:56,690
if I ever got too fucked up within,
I'd watch hunting in Florida,

2082
01:56:56,691 --> 01:57:00,230
it's very easy to get really bear
bear hunting from, in my opinion,

2083
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:02,390
you've done it. I've never done
it. But all the videos are,

2084
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:06,350
they like put a box out full of food and
then they'd sit in a tent and then the

2085
01:57:06,351 --> 01:57:08,960
bear would come out and they shoot it
with a bow and Arrow and the bear would

2086
01:57:08,961 --> 01:57:11,980
get hit, but it would almost feel, it
would seem like the bear be like, oh,

2087
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:12,853
what the fuck was that?

2088
01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:15,530
And then you'd see the look in the
bear's face where they'd be like,

2089
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:18,230
I don't feel good.
I'm going to go rest for a little bit.

2090
01:57:18,410 --> 01:57:22,610
That's how sick girl looks. When he bombs.
It's like, it's like, he's like, he like,

2091
01:57:22,611 --> 01:57:25,920
he looks at you like, did I get, did I
get hit? And you're like, and you're,

2092
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,170
and you know, he's been hit by an arrow.
My favorite one was in, uh, in, in, uh,

2093
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:34,460
in Pearl Harbor. Me, Pearl Harbor,
Hawaii, me, Thompson, Hoorah.

2094
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,420
And Russell Peters. And,
uh, I go up and I do okay,

2095
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:40,100
but maybe I was dirtier
than I should have been,

2096
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:43,490
but it's totally fine because
the only real thing that we're,

2097
01:57:43,491 --> 01:57:46,850
don't make fun of the Hawaiians, that
was it. Don't make fun of the Hawaiians.

2098
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:51,710
And don't bring up Pearl Harbor.
What? Tom's opening joke. He's like,

2099
01:57:51,711 --> 01:57:55,070
man, it's a lot of fat people. He's like,

2100
01:57:55,071 --> 01:57:56,900
I heard island life was slow slope.

2101
01:57:56,901 --> 01:57:58,670
I know they were talking
about their metabolism,

2102
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:01,460
so then he says I got lost walking around.

2103
01:58:01,461 --> 01:58:04,820
Luckily a Japanese guy pointed out the
directions man, those Japanese, no,

2104
01:58:04,821 --> 01:58:06,350
this place like the back of their hand.

2105
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:12,710
I mean he bombed so hard that when he got
off he was like that early sweats like

2106
01:58:12,711 --> 01:58:16,180
where you could and he's like, he's
like, oh, pretty good and you're like,

2107
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:18,110
you might want to go back
to your nest and rock.

2108
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:21,290
You know Tom's going to lose his shit.
That video of where I'm shaving Tom.

2109
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:22,840
That's that week?
Yeah.

2110
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:27,800
How many more after the show before
how many shows did you guys do? One.

2111
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:31,970
Just one and pro. Just one. I went up, I
was a little dirty. I think Tom went up,

2112
01:58:31,971 --> 01:58:34,400
had a rough set. He, he
kind of went back, you know,

2113
01:58:34,401 --> 01:58:39,290
Tom is not right for corporate gig in
that opinion and there's a corporate gig.

2114
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:40,161
It was the,
for the,

2115
01:58:40,161 --> 01:58:43,990
it was like maybe I want to say
3000 people on at Pearl Harbor,

2116
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:47,310
sitting in lawn chairs with their
families. What was the Gig like? What,

2117
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:51,400
who is it for? For the Pearl.
For the USO. Ah, that's fine.

2118
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,570
That's a military gear, not
corporate kid. That same same energy.

2119
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:59,320
So I, and so then Tom sits next
to me, this is my favorite part.

2120
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:03,460
Thompson texted me and Russell Peters
comes on stage and you can hear there's a

2121
01:59:03,461 --> 01:59:04,540
murmuring now mind you,

2122
01:59:04,541 --> 01:59:08,640
we're at war with Iraq and Russell
Peters is a little brown for their taste.

2123
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:12,610
And Tom Goes,
I never realized he looks like the enemy.

2124
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:18,940
And Russell Peters is by the way,
didn't acknowledge it did had a great set,

2125
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:23,620
but you could hear that kind of like they
brought up one of the like and Tom and

2126
01:59:23,621 --> 01:59:26,020
I were in the back like this is bad.
We the next day.

2127
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:29,050
And you thought it was
bad because he was brown.

2128
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:33,700
It was only because we had gone to rifle
training the day before and Russell had

2129
01:59:33,701 --> 01:59:38,260
randomly chose not to go randomly. And
the first words that rifle training was,

2130
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:41,260
there's one rule here. If it's
brown and it moves, you kill it.

2131
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:45,970
And Tom was like, he didn't
bring ruffle. Let the fuck.

2132
01:59:45,971 --> 01:59:48,880
Imagine if you're Mexican and you're in
the fucking army and they tell you that

2133
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:53,440
shit. If it's brown and it moves, we
kill it. Whoa. That guy said that.

2134
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:56,410
And we brought our wives to it.
We, we've had arrives to rifle.

2135
01:59:56,411 --> 02:00:00,310
We shot every gun they had. We brought
our wives and the girls were like,

2136
02:00:00,311 --> 02:00:02,800
right before we went, stepped in, they go,
can we go to the bathroom? Or like, yeah,

2137
02:00:02,801 --> 02:00:06,410
go to the bathroom. So we walk
in and the guy's like, uh,

2138
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:10,120
I thought they were going to be six.
He's like a real military guy.

2139
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:12,220
And we're like, yeah, the girls
went to the bathroom. He was okay.

2140
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:14,980
And then Tom goes, hey, do
me a favor. When they get in,

2141
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:19,370
act a little like aggressive to them
and misogynistic and let's just see the

2142
02:00:19,371 --> 02:00:22,120
looks on their faces. So the
girls walk in and he was on, well,

2143
02:00:22,150 --> 02:00:23,790
typical lady's got lost.

2144
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:26,470
Don't know what time it is of
their man's not next to him.

2145
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:30,580
And Christina and my wife started
bubbling like what the, and he's like,

2146
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:34,240
ladies do follow the men. They'll
know what to do. Thank you gentlemen.

2147
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:38,650
And he got into character so good that
Tom stepped in. He's like, it's a joke.

2148
02:00:38,651 --> 02:00:41,530
Everybody hits a joke.
He's doing it because we asked him to.

2149
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:45,350
This guy was good. Wow.
That's funny. Yeah.

2150
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:48,280
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

2151
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:52,060
It's funny that you can get
a trained killer to just
crack jokes. Oh, the guy was,

2152
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:56,140
it was, that was a really
fun trip. If it's Brown, kill
it. If it's Brown, it moves.

2153
02:00:56,141 --> 02:00:58,570
You kill it. Do you enjoy that?
You have to Osha this junk.

2154
02:00:58,571 --> 02:01:03,070
Have you ever done those? Nope.
No, I don't enjoy them now. I mean,

2155
02:01:03,071 --> 02:01:04,810
I do them, I do them, but I would just,

2156
02:01:04,811 --> 02:01:09,250
I'd be doing it to bomb because you can't
really be dirty. He can't really curse.

2157
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:11,230
There's a bunch of rules
you can't talk about.

2158
02:01:11,231 --> 02:01:12,780
And I'd probably break
all of them and the,

2159
02:01:12,990 --> 02:01:14,800
those corporate things I've
learned I'm just not good at.

2160
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:17,530
Yeah.
And there's also the thing of like,

2161
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:22,620
you got to go to military bases and just
the whole thing about it is I am 100%

2162
02:01:24,371 --> 02:01:28,810
in support of the actual people.
But the idea behind it is this,

2163
02:01:28,811 --> 02:01:32,080
I'm not going to Afghanistan. I'm not,
I'm not going to Iraq and telling jokes,

2164
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:33,430
you know,
I just like,

2165
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:37,870
I get that they need a break and
they need a entertainment and I get,

2166
02:01:37,871 --> 02:01:41,320
it's a great service, but
all that, that's just that,

2167
02:01:41,321 --> 02:01:46,220
that is not a place I want to go. I think
everything about it is fucking like,

2168
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:49,010
imagine going to Gaza right
now. Cracking jokes, magic.

2169
02:01:49,011 --> 02:01:51,470
If you had a fucking
Uso tour gig and Gaza,

2170
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:56,770
like what is going on with Gaza without
fuck is going on with Israel and

2171
02:01:57,171 --> 02:02:01,110
Palestine. What started all of this?
If you paid attention to this, uh,

2172
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:05,750
very subtly, dude, I'm trying not
to, but I have to. I mean everybody,

2173
02:02:06,230 --> 02:02:09,590
I get all these tweets, you're not coming
and going. He goes, well look man, when I,

2174
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:12,920
when I see about death and destruction,
I don't gravitate towards it.

2175
02:02:12,921 --> 02:02:14,390
I don't like try to study it.

2176
02:02:14,391 --> 02:02:18,320
And try to figure out exactly what's
going on so I could pick a side and have a

2177
02:02:18,321 --> 02:02:22,550
viewpoint. I just get sad that there's
more of this bullshit in the world.

2178
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:26,830
I don't, I don't like feel like I'm going
to fix it with my opinion and I don't,

2179
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:29,570
I don't, I keep hearing all
these people have these ideas.

2180
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:33,530
One side will say it's
definitely Israel's fault.

2181
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:36,230
One side will say Hamas is like,
uh,

2182
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:40,220
like Bill Maher said something about
Hamas is like a crazy ex girlfriend.

2183
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:42,500
You know,
like a crazy girl.

2184
02:02:42,501 --> 02:02:46,880
Like she should eventually have to
smack her or something like that.

2185
02:02:46,881 --> 02:02:48,950
Like I don't,
what the fuck he said it was some,

2186
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:54,400
some weird like hacky thing that he was
saying in regards to a war that's going

2187
02:02:56,151 --> 02:03:00,940
on between this really troubled part
of the world. And you know, the,

2188
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:02,900
my number one thing about war,

2189
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:07,850
the number one thing is on an
individual basis, regardless of,

2190
02:03:07,851 --> 02:03:11,150
you know, take out the context
of the civilization they live in,

2191
02:03:11,151 --> 02:03:13,970
the culture they live in, the,
the, the language that they speak.

2192
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:18,320
These people don't know each other.
Why are they fighting to the death?

2193
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:20,200
They don't even know each other there.

2194
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:23,360
You're launching missiles
at people you've never met.

2195
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:26,900
They're shooting back at you.
It's crazy.

2196
02:03:26,901 --> 02:03:31,901
The fact that we still do it in 2014 I
don't give a fuck who side you should be

2197
02:03:32,271 --> 02:03:36,920
on or what it represents. It represents
the fact that we're still retarded.

2198
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:40,400
It represents the fact that we still
can't figure out how to overcome our

2199
02:03:40,401 --> 02:03:43,790
differences with any other way other
than shooting missiles at each other or

2200
02:03:43,791 --> 02:03:48,791
dropping bombs or setting up IED or
shooting people at checkpoints or whatever

2201
02:03:49,401 --> 02:03:50,020
it is,

2202
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:55,020
whatever method that they choose to
to show that we're still in some way

2203
02:03:55,700 --> 02:03:59,660
barbarians and that's what it is.
We're barbarians with way better weapons.

2204
02:03:59,661 --> 02:04:01,160
It's fucking crazy.

2205
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:06,530
I understand that sometimes there's acts
of aggression and you need to protect

2206
02:04:06,531 --> 02:04:11,330
people from people more barbaric than us,
but it makes me sad.

2207
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,010
I mean,
that's the only other way.

2208
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:18,100
The only way I know to
describe my feelings about
anything that happens with war

2209
02:04:18,741 --> 02:04:22,760
in the news.
Anytime violence breaks out any anytime,

2210
02:04:22,761 --> 02:04:24,680
like this Gaza,
Palestine thing,

2211
02:04:24,681 --> 02:04:28,280
I just get just depressed at my core.

2212
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:31,670
I can't read about it. I'm not
going to pick a side. I'm not,

2213
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:33,850
my side is the human side.
On my Mama.

2214
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:38,280
I'm on the human race side and the
human race is not benefiting from this

2215
02:04:38,281 --> 02:04:39,114
fucking shit.

2216
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:44,360
I don't know what it would take to cause
Palestine and Israel to be cool with

2217
02:04:44,851 --> 02:04:46,590
each other. I don't
understand it. I don't,

2218
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:49,980
I don't know how you could
hate each other for so long.

2219
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:52,050
How you could have so many
different points of view.

2220
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:56,940
How you get a guy like Dennis Prager who
says Palestine will not be happy unless

2221
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,530
Israel is dead. There is no negotiating.
I'll come. They're fucking people.

2222
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:04,140
They're people.
I don't know how they're communicating.

2223
02:05:04,141 --> 02:05:05,820
I don't know if they understand
each other's language.

2224
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:10,950
I don't know how much of this is just
deep seated ancient shit that these people

2225
02:05:10,951 --> 02:05:15,450
have just carried with them forever.
But my position on it,

2226
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:17,490
I'm not taking any sides.

2227
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:20,580
My position on it is the whole
thing is completely fucked.

2228
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:24,150
The whole thing fucked.
It's fucked that people still do this.

2229
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:29,190
It's fucked until we recognize it. It's
fucked. And maybe if I lived in Israel,

2230
02:05:29,191 --> 02:05:30,510
I'd have a totally
different state of mind.

2231
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:35,780
Maybe if I lived in a place that was
regularly attacked and at war I would be

2232
02:05:36,301 --> 02:05:41,130
more harsh and more closed off to it. I
don't know. I don't know. But you know,

2233
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:44,490
for people who want my take on it to keep
tweeting me about it, that's my take.

2234
02:05:44,491 --> 02:05:49,110
My take is it's, I'm tired
of living my life. I mean,

2235
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:53,750
look, I'm 46, I'll be 47 in
August. At what point in time? Um,

2236
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:55,470
I mean as a,
as a person,

2237
02:05:56,070 --> 02:06:01,070
I've grown and matured and I understand
myself and how I interface with other

2238
02:06:01,321 --> 02:06:05,610
people and society and culture
much better. I'm much better at it.

2239
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:08,970
But when I look at like
human beings in general,

2240
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,950
I don't necessarily know if I see
that much growth when it comes to

2241
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:16,350
international relations,
when it comes to war,

2242
02:06:16,351 --> 02:06:19,660
when it comes to the way we
react to each other, I just,

2243
02:06:19,661 --> 02:06:24,210
I keep seeing the same fucking patterns
repeating themselves over and over again.

2244
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:25,230
Whether it's in Iraq,

2245
02:06:25,231 --> 02:06:27,840
whether it's in this idea that
we're supposed to invade Syria,

2246
02:06:27,841 --> 02:06:30,550
where you get fucking Dick Cheney who
goes in the news the other day and they

2247
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:31,380
did an interview with him.

2248
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:35,430
He said his number one regret that he
didn't invade Iran at the same time they

2249
02:06:35,431 --> 02:06:39,750
invaded Iraq. You know, I just,

2250
02:06:39,870 --> 02:06:44,340
I'm disappointed in, in human beings, I
think there's gonna come a certain time,

2251
02:06:44,341 --> 02:06:46,620
but we have to get to
the root of the problem.

2252
02:06:46,621 --> 02:06:51,621
Why did these things always have
to end in unfathomable violence?

2253
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:57,660
Like what is it about human beings
and is it the way we're being led?

2254
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:01,110
Is the way we're being governed
or is it something about us?

2255
02:07:01,111 --> 02:07:04,830
Some fundamental aspect of
what we are as a, as a being.

2256
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:06,540
I don't have the answer to that,

2257
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:11,840
but I know that me as a person who hopes
for the best wishes for the best in in

2258
02:07:12,541 --> 02:07:16,620
human beings, I see this and it just makes
me sad, is no other way to describe it.

2259
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:19,770
I know that's a very limited way
of describing things and it's,

2260
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:24,300
it leaves a lot open to interpretation.
That's how I feel about it. I just,

2261
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:27,390
I look at the news every day. I mean,
look, we can go to CNN right now.

2262
02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:32,490
I'll go to cnn.com and I guarantee you
it's fucking death and destruction this

2263
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:36,790
weekend. Uh, 47 people shot five
dead and just Chicago. Well,

2264
02:07:36,791 --> 02:07:41,530
Chicago was going through some serious
fucking gang violence. Really? Yeah, sure.

2265
02:07:41,531 --> 02:07:44,800
It's gang violence. And uh, I was
talking to a guy last time was there,

2266
02:07:44,801 --> 02:07:49,801
it was a former cop and his take on it
was that what happened was there was some

2267
02:07:49,961 --> 02:07:54,961
major players in the drug game that were
arrested and they left a vacuum because

2268
02:07:55,541 --> 02:07:58,840
there's these gang members
that got arrested and there
was a power vacuum that's

2269
02:07:58,841 --> 02:08:01,510
being filled now with violence.
So yeah,

2270
02:08:01,511 --> 02:08:05,770
it's probably more people dead
right in there then it isn't Gaza.

2271
02:08:06,670 --> 02:08:10,000
More people been killed by
cops than died in the Iraq war.

2272
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:13,000
So funny if you said to me though,
would you rather go to Gaza or Chicago?

2273
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:13,990
I'd be like, oh, Chicago.

2274
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:19,030
Yeah. Well most of Chicago safe as
fuck. It's the south side of Chicago.

2275
02:08:19,031 --> 02:08:22,090
You go to the ghetto.
That's where you might as well be in Gaza.

2276
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:25,120
I used to do a great club down there,
riddles in the south side of Chicago.

2277
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:28,180
Hello blog. When did you do
the south side of Chicago? But

2278
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:30,220
when I first started, the guy named Brent,
I was just talking to them about it.

2279
02:08:30,270 --> 02:08:33,460
So a guy named Brent used to run it.
You get two grand for the weekend.

2280
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:35,710
Oh you had to do was Friday and Saturday,
two shows each night.

2281
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:39,490
It was really nice and
it was an all backup,

2282
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:44,200
all black tee shirt off and fucking
saying no fucking [inaudible] songs.

2283
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:45,670
I would do it,

2284
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:50,350
I could have whatever I would,
I remember my first joke,

2285
02:08:50,351 --> 02:08:53,620
the first time I worked there was
about Duran Duran and some black ticks.

2286
02:08:53,621 --> 02:08:58,210
Like who the fuck's he? I was like, it's
a band. And she's like, oh no, no Brent,

2287
02:08:58,240 --> 02:09:01,420
you better talk about black people,
mother fucker. And I was like done.

2288
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:06,280
So I spent the rest of the week just to
an all black jokes and I fucking loved

2289
02:09:06,281 --> 02:09:09,250
it. I had, so I guess it was like
getting away with everything.

2290
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:12,310
And I remember like a dude stood up and
proposed to his chick in the middle of

2291
02:09:12,311 --> 02:09:16,480
one of my shows. I was like, fuck
yeah, I was chaos. It is pretty crazy.

2292
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:19,250
At 47 people shots in Chicago.
Yeah.

2293
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:25,360
It's weird how it like most cities it's
always like the south side is the bad

2294
02:09:25,361 --> 02:09:28,480
side. It's like, well not
in Tampa really. Yeah,

2295
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:31,560
that's about as good and south Tampa
is the best area to live in. Really?

2296
02:09:31,630 --> 02:09:33,730
North Tampa is where all the rednecks
live. That's where I grew up.

2297
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:38,470
North Tampa nor Tampa. Is that all
elevated trucks? Shit, you got it.

2298
02:09:38,830 --> 02:09:42,700
Fireworks, homemade fireworks,
fireworks, hunting gators,

2299
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:45,730
heightened gators when you were a
kid. Oh, when I, when I, when we,

2300
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:49,030
I'll never forget,
when we went to look at our land,

2301
02:09:49,031 --> 02:09:52,600
my dad bought like a piece of land
in North Dakota and North Florida,

2302
02:09:52,601 --> 02:09:54,160
Tampa and he was like,
we're going to build on it.

2303
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:58,930
We went out as a family to go look at it
and there were these two rednecks that

2304
02:09:58,931 --> 02:10:02,200
had chased this other redneck in his
underwear up on a mound in the middle of

2305
02:10:02,201 --> 02:10:05,230
the lake and they were shooting
Bibi's Adam, Mike is your land.

2306
02:10:05,231 --> 02:10:07,960
This is our land in my day and
this is our lake and land that,

2307
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:11,170
that little mound and we had a picture
cause it's still there. It's still there.

2308
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:14,950
And they had chased the boy up there in
his and he was in his underwear and my

2309
02:10:14,951 --> 02:10:17,770
dad was like, hey everybody cut
it out. That's enough. And My,

2310
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:21,280
they looked at my dad and they go, we
called him fair and square and I was like,

2311
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:25,400
oh my God. And this is private land.
It was like your land. It was a lake.

2312
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:28,420
There's a lake they were on, they were
on a boat. So it was a lake and the,

2313
02:10:28,421 --> 02:10:32,350
and it was an island that was like
maybe 10 feet off the shore of where our

2314
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:36,860
house still, it's a big lake. It's a
pretty big lake. It's not all yours.

2315
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:39,310
The whole that is not all ours but a,

2316
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:42,620
but and then the other side of the lake
was like North Tampa. It was lutes.

2317
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:43,280
It's called loot.

2318
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:46,430
We got in the car that day and then
radio stations changed and I remember the

2319
02:10:46,431 --> 02:10:51,050
song was downtown loot.
This is their intro to the song downtown.

2320
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:54,140
Lutes kick off your boots.
Give a Holler in who's he hall.

2321
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,270
And that was our new neighborhood.
Wow.

2322
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:57,260
Jesus Christ.

2323
02:10:57,261 --> 02:11:00,130
Why didn't you research it a little bit
for you fucking bought land there? No,

2324
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:01,320
cause it was,
it was cheap property.

2325
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:06,770
I've heard it's like solid childhood.
I fucking know.

2326
02:11:06,771 --> 02:11:07,860
Probably hung gators.

2327
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:10,100
Yeah.
I think the whole state of Florida,

2328
02:11:10,101 --> 02:11:14,110
it's considered the south side of the
United States. That's a good point.

2329
02:11:15,230 --> 02:11:17,670
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

2330
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:22,670
The decay of the country.
Florida is a weird fucking place.

2331
02:11:22,671 --> 02:11:26,750
I can't go in there next month to Tampa,
Jacksonville and Orlando. Death Squad.

2332
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:29,910
Yep. Oh, well Tripoli. Yeah. Yeah. Let
me set you guys up on my buddy cow head.

2333
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,500
All right,
cool.

2334
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:32,920
Callen just got back.
Kallan was just in West Palm.

2335
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:35,320
We were just talking about how
they should have to, you did that.

2336
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:38,260
You should have to have a fucking
passport to get there because you don't

2337
02:11:38,261 --> 02:11:40,720
realize like it's like they live
like it's a tropical country.

2338
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:43,260
Like people were just drinking
and partying Barksdale,

2339
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:46,240
but the five o'clock in the morning,
it's a different world.

2340
02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:49,690
And if you go to anywhere else in
the country and then go to Florida,

2341
02:11:49,691 --> 02:11:52,660
you feel like you're in some
crazy tropical vacation place.

2342
02:11:52,990 --> 02:11:55,510
Is Parrots patronizing
is the weirdest thing.

2343
02:11:55,511 --> 02:11:59,860
How much everyone drinks and everyone
just gets drunk all the time there.

2344
02:11:59,890 --> 02:12:03,300
That's all I remember going to Florida.
Every barge is packs.

2345
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:04,750
You get to take the edge off that meth.

2346
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:08,620
You know what's crazy is I have
friends in Florida who have uh,

2347
02:12:08,650 --> 02:12:11,740
who have been to rehab and stuff. One
of the most of the talking on the phone,

2348
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:13,360
that doesn't even make sense,

2349
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:16,990
but it's so funny they consider a
marijuana like bad in Florida of course.

2350
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:18,370
But I've told my buddy, I was like, dude,

2351
02:12:18,371 --> 02:12:20,800
why don't you just move to Colorado
and then no one will think you have a

2352
02:12:20,801 --> 02:12:23,620
problem.
It's like they wouldn't be able to fit in.

2353
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:26,200
If you live your whole life in
Florida and you go to Colorado,

2354
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:29,170
they're going to go, you gotta
go, you gotta get Outta here man.

2355
02:12:29,190 --> 02:12:33,670
We were fucking place.
Florida and Colorado are like
opposite ends of the earth.

2356
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,410
They are like polar SPEC. You
fucking, your watch won't work there.

2357
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:41,140
Your compass will be backwards north,
south,

2358
02:12:41,141 --> 02:12:45,220
south north to try and get you out of
there. Colorado is perfect for weed.

2359
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:48,480
Florida is perfect for a fence.
What are the next day?

2360
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,440
What did the next states that
are going to legalize marijuana?

2361
02:12:50,650 --> 02:12:53,320
It's a good question. Not really.
They're going to medically,

2362
02:12:53,321 --> 02:12:56,470
but I dunno about legal. Legal.
Medically legal is important.

2363
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:58,450
It's the gateway to legal,
legal.

2364
02:12:58,930 --> 02:13:03,250
But what happens is they start feeling
the impact, the revenue impact.

2365
02:13:03,290 --> 02:13:06,730
Colorado is making more than a hundred
million dollars this year and way more

2366
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:11,290
money than they thought they were going
to. And the tax rate is crazy high,

2367
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:15,430
39% so if you buy weed,
their 39% of it goes to the government.

2368
02:13:15,431 --> 02:13:17,620
So the government is essentially
a drug dealer. And you know,

2369
02:13:17,621 --> 02:13:19,270
the people buying it are all tourists.

2370
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:22,690
A lot of the people are buying our
tourists. While we were just in a,

2371
02:13:22,691 --> 02:13:25,980
I just did a wise guys and Salt
Lake City. You ever do that? No. Uh,

2372
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:30,040
after hearing you talk about it, I
want to do it. Fuck it was awesome.

2373
02:13:30,490 --> 02:13:32,100
Just fucking great.
First

2374
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,110
of all, the clubs perfect.
It's the perfect. So everybody
had told me about it.

2375
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:37,020
Diaz told me about it.
Duncan told me about it.

2376
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:40,890
[inaudible] told me about bird was just
there. So I was, I, that's it. I'm gone.

2377
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:42,780
So I, I, I book it,

2378
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:47,370
I go there and it was fucking magic
meant people couldn't have been cooler.

2379
02:13:47,820 --> 02:13:51,330
It's like you think like you're going
to salt lake city's bunch of Goddamn

2380
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:53,460
Mormons. No, those aren't
the ones coming to your show.

2381
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:58,530
More means only like 20% of the population
there. The rast is cool as fuck.

2382
02:13:58,610 --> 02:14:01,520
Mormons are always cool as
fuck. Nice. I dig Mormons.

2383
02:14:01,570 --> 02:14:04,450
The nicest cult members ever.
They're the nicest.

2384
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:06,370
They're less creepy than Scientologists.

2385
02:14:06,371 --> 02:14:09,190
Scientologists as second
nicest as far as cult members

2386
02:14:09,190 --> 02:14:12,070
were. Scientologists almost switched
me one time. Whoa. What happened?

2387
02:14:12,071 --> 02:14:16,870
Dinner Party got a little tipsy and I was
like, so actually I was sober I think,

2388
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:18,940
but it was like a,
and that's when you lost me.

2389
02:14:18,970 --> 02:14:22,120
I'm not believing the story anymore. I
was like, you guys believe in aliens?

2390
02:14:22,180 --> 02:14:25,120
And they're like, well you could, I
mean you could sit will it down to that.

2391
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:29,320
And I was like, is that, is that weird?
It was this in Tampa is in la or water.

2392
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:33,520
Oh my dad used to represent l Ron
Hubbard. Whoa. Yup. You Dad knew him.

2393
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:37,570
My Dad knew the mother fucker. Whoa. My
Dad. Why did that Guy Die? I don't know.

2394
02:14:37,610 --> 02:14:40,810
Long time ago. Right. God dammit.
I wish I had more information.

2395
02:14:40,811 --> 02:14:45,250
I wish I listened better. My Dad,
my dad used to come out here,

2396
02:14:45,370 --> 02:14:48,310
cause Clearwater is a port town.
M l Ron Hubbard lived on a boat.

2397
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:51,460
So He'd come into different, yeah,
we have a house in Clearwater.

2398
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:54,010
They used to come in to clear water.
They have a huge Scientology center there.

2399
02:14:54,430 --> 02:14:55,800
Yeah. It's, it's a huge, my parents,

2400
02:14:55,830 --> 02:15:00,000
you still live in Clearwater. Yeah.
So, uh, the eye when I drive it around,

2401
02:15:00,001 --> 02:15:01,740
there was like all these
Scientology shit and I was like,

2402
02:15:01,741 --> 02:15:04,260
what's going on in there?
Like towns filled with Scientologists.

2403
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,420
Yeah, my dad represented
someone. Okay. Are Now,

2404
02:15:06,421 --> 02:15:10,590
I remember my dad represented someone
that the church tried to kidnap

2405
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:12,721
dad.

2406
02:15:12,721 --> 02:15:16,080
I'm sorry if I'm fucking this up or if
I'm not supposed to tell these stories

2407
02:15:16,510 --> 02:15:20,520
because he, he's a lawyer. They knew over
seven years, it's been a while. So he, uh,

2408
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:21,810
he represented someone,

2409
02:15:21,811 --> 02:15:24,630
the church tried to kidnapped and hold
because they were trying to get out of

2410
02:15:24,631 --> 02:15:26,790
the church and the church was
saying they wanted him back in.

2411
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:29,460
And my dad did such a good job that
the church thing came to him and said,

2412
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:33,120
would you represent, are like
cover all, like whatever it is,

2413
02:15:33,121 --> 02:15:37,140
where they pay you money to not, um,
to represent every case they have.

2414
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:40,500
And so my dad did that for like 10 years
and they made it, made a ton of money.

2415
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:43,110
Then the church left him and then
didn't pay for like two years.

2416
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:48,170
He died in [inaudible] 86. Yeah. This
probably, and he died in California. Oh,

2417
02:15:48,171 --> 02:15:52,410
interesting. So you didn't die when that
volcano blew up? No, that's not real,

2418
02:15:52,411 --> 02:15:54,630
Brian.
That's a dianetics commercial.

2419
02:15:56,380 --> 02:16:01,380
I didn't even know you were saying 86
I wonder if my dad will watch thing.

2420
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:05,370
I never asked. My Dad went over our
numbers like 75 years old when he died.

2421
02:16:05,810 --> 02:16:08,970
It's probably a Douche bag. Come on.
This is terrible, right? It's a Scifi.

2422
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:12,330
So that was pretty cool. He's probably
a Dork. Wonder if I could do that.

2423
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:13,150
He started,

2424
02:16:13,150 --> 02:16:14,280
Bro.
Trust me,

2425
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:18,730
if you guys starts to religion and your
religion is based on some of the worst

2426
02:16:18,731 --> 02:16:20,170
science fiction writing of all that.

2427
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:23,820
So here's how they're most switched
me. Okay. Yeah. So they're like a,

2428
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:25,910
so we're at dinner and I said, you gotta
believe in aliens? And they're like,

2429
02:16:25,911 --> 02:16:29,350
well yeah, you can whittle it down to
that. And I go, it's Kinda fucked up.

2430
02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:34,510
And they're like, well, what's your thing?
And I know you're gonna mock this by go,

2431
02:16:34,511 --> 02:16:38,920
I'm Catholic. And they're
like, so you believe in Jesus?
Oh yeah. And they're like,

2432
02:16:38,921 --> 02:16:42,310
do you believe that Jesus really like
got gotten nailed to the cross and then

2433
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:45,180
putting a cave and then actually move
the Rock and rose again? I go, no.

2434
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:47,470
Well I mean it's fig. It's
figured it. And they're like,

2435
02:16:47,471 --> 02:16:50,230
do you believe that Moses actually
part of the cs are that no,

2436
02:16:50,231 --> 02:16:53,860
actually put all the animals on the Ark.
I go know their stories and I,

2437
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:57,550
and they're like, so you are admitting
that there's some holes in your,

2438
02:16:57,610 --> 02:16:59,680
in your religion. I go,
well yeah, it's, you know,

2439
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:02,760
and then like do you believe in aliens?
And I go, oh definitely. And then I say,

2440
02:17:02,761 --> 02:17:04,750
you actually believe in the
shit that we believe in.

2441
02:17:04,751 --> 02:17:08,080
You actually believe there's life out
in the universe. You believe that?

2442
02:17:08,081 --> 02:17:09,580
And I was like, Oh yeah. And then I can,

2443
02:17:09,581 --> 02:17:13,280
you'll admit that the thing that use your
faith, you have questions about that.

2444
02:17:13,290 --> 02:17:16,010
Like why wouldn't you listen to what we
have to say? And I was like, motherfucker,

2445
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:18,220
this is how they get ya.
Cause I believe in aliens.

2446
02:17:18,430 --> 02:17:21,550
So when they said that,
did you like open yourself up a little?

2447
02:17:21,551 --> 02:17:24,220
Relaxed and go tell me what it down.
She'll shut down.

2448
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:26,490
Yup.
Just like I'm in camp.

2449
02:17:26,491 --> 02:17:28,620
And the kid next to me touched my dick
and it felt good and I was like, oh,

2450
02:17:28,650 --> 02:17:30,960
that's a boy. Nope. Shut it down.

2451
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:34,740
Or like I'm watching naked and
afraid and I see the ass. I'm like,

2452
02:17:34,741 --> 02:17:38,220
that's hot and it's a dude. And I'm
like, fuck, I just shut it down.

2453
02:17:38,270 --> 02:17:40,700
Okay, so you shut it down and you
just didn't let him keep going.

2454
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:44,630
What are they trying? Uh, no, they were
soft selling. What's the soft sell? Like?

2455
02:17:44,631 --> 02:17:45,350
They always say,

2456
02:17:45,350 --> 02:17:49,040
you should come by and put on some fucking
hold these a Campbell soup cans that

2457
02:17:49,041 --> 02:17:51,290
are attached to strings.
So they read your mind.

2458
02:17:51,450 --> 02:17:53,370
They knew my wife to an acting group.

2459
02:17:53,371 --> 02:17:58,110
There's a think called the the
actors camp or actors group actors.

2460
02:17:58,140 --> 02:18:02,430
Collum would know exactly what it is. The
actors, it's a Scientology acting group.

2461
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:05,040
It's an Scientology asking group.
And what they do is they'll, uh,

2462
02:18:05,041 --> 02:18:07,200
they'll audit you halfway
through the semester,

2463
02:18:07,201 --> 02:18:09,330
the audit you and tell you what's wrong
with you and what you need to work.

2464
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:10,590
And when you say audit,
what do you mean?

2465
02:18:10,591 --> 02:18:12,810
As a Scientology version of
audit for people think like,

2466
02:18:12,811 --> 02:18:13,830
well you gotta check your taxes.

2467
02:18:14,030 --> 02:18:15,650
Yeah, Oh yeah, it's a Scientology audit.

2468
02:18:15,651 --> 02:18:18,770
The audit you and say this is what's
wrong with you as a person and this is

2469
02:18:18,771 --> 02:18:22,160
what's holding you guys back as an
actress. And so my wife was in it,

2470
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:24,560
my wife's best friend was in
it and they came and these,

2471
02:18:24,650 --> 02:18:28,190
these two people were in it and
they came back and my wife's like,

2472
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:30,640
fuck that place. I was like, why?
What's wrong with it? She's like,

2473
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:32,510
they said that this, this, this and that.

2474
02:18:32,511 --> 02:18:35,540
It was all really accurate and I was like,
what did they say about your friend?

2475
02:18:35,570 --> 02:18:38,540
And it was, I mean it was like exactly
what I would've said. I was like,

2476
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:41,060
the Scientologists seem to have a fucking,

2477
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:44,180
they can find your weakness or what
the thing is that fucks you up.

2478
02:18:44,420 --> 02:18:47,200
And then once you identify that
it's real and you're like, ah,

2479
02:18:47,201 --> 02:18:49,830
I've got to listen to what you say.
Well, they have a lot of a lot of stuff

2480
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:53,340
in Scientology and dianetics itself.
Like they call it dianetics.

2481
02:18:53,341 --> 02:18:54,570
That's what the book is based on.

2482
02:18:54,571 --> 02:18:59,571
That's a lot of it can be beneficial if
you need a structure in your life and

2483
02:19:00,421 --> 02:19:04,260
you need some sort of like a framework
on which to think and how to behave.

2484
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:06,780
They get you with that a lot.
But they also in La,

2485
02:19:06,781 --> 02:19:11,010
they run a lot of acting classes. I'd
be the Scientologists who was like, Hey,

2486
02:19:11,011 --> 02:19:12,900
when do we get famous?
I was dating this chick,

2487
02:19:12,930 --> 02:19:15,120
I don't know if I ever sell the
story of the podcast is great.

2488
02:19:15,150 --> 02:19:19,290
This is back in the early days before I
had my no head shots policy back in the

2489
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:23,190
day. Um, yeah, I only dated a few
actions before. I was like, all right,

2490
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:25,020
that's enough.
This is fucking this.

2491
02:19:25,230 --> 02:19:28,130
And then I dated a regular girl
and she was so I was like, I'm

2492
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:31,340
done with actresses. Which begs a
question, how did your wife Never Act?

2493
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:35,840
Cause she's very attractive. Uh,
whatever. Anyway, here's my story.

2494
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,480
Um, the, uh,

2495
02:19:38,481 --> 02:19:42,710
the class that she was in was run by the
scientologist and this Scientologists

2496
02:19:42,711 --> 02:19:47,390
guy was like soft sell the whole way.
But he would occasionally bring it up.

2497
02:19:47,391 --> 02:19:51,620
Like one of the reasons why he
can get into these roles and his,

2498
02:19:51,621 --> 02:19:55,980
cause he's so comfortable
with who he is and he, so he,

2499
02:19:56,210 --> 02:19:58,460
he understands who he is as a person.

2500
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,310
So because of that he
can abandon that and no,

2501
02:20:01,311 --> 02:20:05,230
it's always going to be there when it
comes back and that he can get into his,

2502
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:09,440
and I watch this guy teaching this
class. Like she, this chick was so,

2503
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:13,830
it was so brutal. She would want
you to watch her acting class.

2504
02:20:13,831 --> 02:20:15,650
Like come watch my acting class.
I'd sit,

2505
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:18,080
she just needed to be
watched all the time.

2506
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:19,520
She needed massive amounts of attention.

2507
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:24,530
And one of the things that they would
do in the class was a private moment and

2508
02:20:24,531 --> 02:20:27,800
that's what it was.
And so you wouldn't be acting out a scene,

2509
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:31,130
you'd be doing a private moment.
So what a private moment is,

2510
02:20:31,131 --> 02:20:36,131
you get on your fucking stage and you
start going through like pretending you're

2511
02:20:36,531 --> 02:20:38,990
reading your email.
This is like pre email.

2512
02:20:38,991 --> 02:20:41,090
So it'd be like reading a
book or something like that,

2513
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:45,380
pretending your washing
dishes. And so, you know,

2514
02:20:45,381 --> 02:20:49,010
she would like be walking around like
doing her and people would just be staring

2515
02:20:49,011 --> 02:20:52,390
at her and, and she was
doing her shit. I understand.

2516
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:57,110
It's like learning how the idea was
learning how to be completely natural in

2517
02:20:57,111 --> 02:21:01,460
front of people and you know, and I go
and I saw, I was mocking it. Of course,

2518
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:04,610
my mock everything and I go, yeah, I go,

2519
02:21:04,611 --> 02:21:08,480
that's gonna fucking really help you
when you have to actually talk and act.

2520
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:09,740
Yeah, it's awesome. I go,

2521
02:21:09,741 --> 02:21:13,280
it's not at all that what they're
doing is just placating your need for

2522
02:21:13,281 --> 02:21:16,980
attention by giving you attention
in this weird way. You know,

2523
02:21:16,981 --> 02:21:19,610
like now it's your turn to be the one
that everybody looks at because that's

2524
02:21:19,611 --> 02:21:23,000
what the fuck it is. You know, it
was, it was nonsense, but it's,

2525
02:21:23,001 --> 02:21:28,001
this guy would give this like Scientology
soft sell that because of my religion

2526
02:21:30,050 --> 02:21:33,670
and my, my deep seated
understanding of who I am, I'm,

2527
02:21:33,740 --> 02:21:38,330
I'm able to let it all go in a band of
it. Meanwhile, he was at terrible actor.

2528
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:42,020
Oh, terrible. Terrible.
They're all terrible.

2529
02:21:42,021 --> 02:21:45,130
Almost all acting teachers saw chuck.

2530
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:49,610
They forced me to get an acting coach when
I got my development deal with Disney.

2531
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:52,880
So I had to take like three or
four classes with this lady.

2532
02:21:52,881 --> 02:21:56,090
And I know I've talked about this before.
She was in New York and she uh,

2533
02:21:56,510 --> 02:21:59,300
she would fucking, cause I had
a development deal do a sitcom.

2534
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:04,280
She would keep saying that if there was
a part to play my mom on the show that I

2535
02:22:04,281 --> 02:22:06,950
was going to get her in front of the
studio and she's going to play my mom.

2536
02:22:06,951 --> 02:22:11,000
She's just fucking bitch was crazy.
But I would do, I would read with her,

2537
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:15,650
you know, like we'd have to read and she
was fucking terrible. Fucking terrible.

2538
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:19,580
And then I realize like if she was
really good she'd be out acting like she

2539
02:22:19,581 --> 02:22:21,620
wouldn't be teaching goddamn acting class.

2540
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:25,080
And you realize like the only people
teaching acting classes or people that are

2541
02:22:25,081 --> 02:22:28,020
fucking terrible at acting.
And then I went on to do stand up,

2542
02:22:28,170 --> 02:22:31,350
I mean obviously I was doing stand
up at the time but went on to be more

2543
02:22:31,351 --> 02:22:32,280
successful with stand up.

2544
02:22:32,310 --> 02:22:35,550
And then I realized that the people that
were teaching these classes were all

2545
02:22:35,551 --> 02:22:37,290
these dog shit comedians.

2546
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:41,190
Like when's the last time you saw a
standup comedy class that was taught by

2547
02:22:41,191 --> 02:22:42,840
anyone who's ever funny at all?

2548
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:46,620
They don't do it are you should
fear did a seminar thing for comics.

2549
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:50,320
It was fucking great. He did it in
Phoenix and he made a recording of it.

2550
02:22:50,350 --> 02:22:53,250
I think he released it as a
podcast but it was perfect.

2551
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:57,800
It was like the only time that I've
ever seen like our real solid stand up,

2552
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:02,400
give advice to young comics did it
for free. Totally free. No class is.

2553
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:06,450
And I think it was sort of his way of
saying like let's fuck these fucking

2554
02:23:06,451 --> 02:23:10,070
classes aren't what you need. This is
what you need. This is how you write this.

2555
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:12,120
I get a manager,
this is what you should do,

2556
02:23:12,210 --> 02:23:16,170
this is how you should develop material,
this is how you get work. And you know,

2557
02:23:16,171 --> 02:23:19,470
spent like a couple hours doing it and
it was beautiful because all it's all you

2558
02:23:19,471 --> 02:23:22,950
need. That's all you need. Yeah. The
only thing else enacting class does,

2559
02:23:22,951 --> 02:23:27,450
or rather a comedy class does
let you go on stage, you know?

2560
02:23:27,570 --> 02:23:30,270
But really the best way to do it,
it's just go to a fucking open Mike night,

2561
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:34,360
right? I think so. Watch kill
Tony. Well that's killed.

2562
02:23:34,370 --> 02:23:37,290
Tony is a fascinating podcast for
folks who don't know what it is.

2563
02:23:37,291 --> 02:23:41,340
We just did it recently.
Me and dom Irrera and Brian of course,

2564
02:23:41,341 --> 02:23:43,980
and and Tony Hinchcliffe
who's fucking hilarious.

2565
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:46,170
We did wiseguys together all weekend,
Utah.

2566
02:23:46,380 --> 02:23:49,140
But Tony's show is all about guys go up,

2567
02:23:49,141 --> 02:23:52,950
they do a minute and then professional
comics talk to them about their beds and

2568
02:23:52,951 --> 02:23:55,290
some,
it's like you get a grab bag.

2569
02:23:55,470 --> 02:23:58,620
Some of them are really funny like
that one bricks and bullets kid.

2570
02:23:58,621 --> 02:24:02,600
That kid was in from a, yeah.
Oh I know. Bricks and bullets.

2571
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:06,900
Barney cases. First set ever. He did
on the killed Tony that we were on.

2572
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:10,350
Really Funny Kid. He's, if he keeps going,

2573
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:12,240
he's going to be a real comic for sure.

2574
02:24:12,270 --> 02:24:15,060
And then the two chicks
that you do it with.

2575
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:17,220
Kim,
Kimberly Kahneman and Sarah wine chick

2576
02:24:17,390 --> 02:24:21,500
who write a minute's worth of
new material every fucking week.

2577
02:24:21,501 --> 02:24:23,840
Did I do it with them?
Yeah, they're fucking good.

2578
02:24:23,841 --> 02:24:27,350
I know exactly what I'm seeing is that
writing a minute's worth of new shit

2579
02:24:27,351 --> 02:24:31,730
every week in their whole careers have
been spent doing that from the moment

2580
02:24:31,731 --> 02:24:34,910
they first get on stage until now.
Like over a year's worth.

2581
02:24:35,060 --> 02:24:38,800
They've been doing sets every
fucking week amid a fresh new minute

2582
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:43,400
that killed Tony was a blast. I did it
with a, did I do it with cigarettes?

2583
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:44,910
Yes. The, and I did one.

2584
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:48,620
It was so much fun. So fun.
It's a real show. And you
know what I was telling Tony,

2585
02:24:48,621 --> 02:24:50,890
I was like, this show should be on
comedy central. And that thought about,

2586
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:54,310
I'm like, no, it shouldn't be what it
is. We're thinking of things. Things

2587
02:24:54,310 --> 02:24:58,390
we wouldn't be able to do.
Like we wouldn't be able to
have the Iron Patriot guy.

2588
02:24:58,420 --> 02:25:00,080
We wouldn't be able to just like back.
No.

2589
02:25:00,110 --> 02:25:04,530
While we have fake ones though we
we uh, yeah, we had now and we,

2590
02:25:04,531 --> 02:25:06,640
we have like fake sponsors on each one.

2591
02:25:06,641 --> 02:25:10,120
We have like we play music in between
when people come up cause it's supposed to

2592
02:25:10,121 --> 02:25:11,860
sound like a real comedy
club when you kid up,

2593
02:25:11,861 --> 02:25:15,040
you know there's like cherry pies
playing when you were getting on stage or

2594
02:25:15,041 --> 02:25:18,880
whatever. I really liked doing that. I'll
tell you what podcasts I really like to,

2595
02:25:19,210 --> 02:25:21,520
uh, first of all, Dan
Carlin, if you're listening,

2596
02:25:21,550 --> 02:25:24,070
I'm still waiting patiently
for a hardcore, I'm

2597
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:27,850
waiting forever. It's a lot of work too.
I know, I know. I'm waiting patiently.

2598
02:25:27,851 --> 02:25:29,260
I'm just letting them
know people are waiting.

2599
02:25:29,740 --> 02:25:32,860
That fucking guy puts in some work.
Like those things are mini.

2600
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:35,590
It's like books on tape. I fucking
love them. I sleep to them.

2601
02:25:35,591 --> 02:25:38,410
I listened to while I sleep and I
dream that I'm in that scene. Yeah.

2602
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:42,430
The what they do and radio lab dub
does is so different than what we do.

2603
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:45,970
You know, I've done two of these today.
It's easy lifting. It's not fucking,

2604
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:49,600
it's not the same thing.
This is that this is easy lifting.

2605
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:52,450
That first one was that was
like you, you, you were,

2606
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:54,280
trust me when I say you were involved,

2607
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:57,580
like you were listening hard and you had
questions that were very technical and

2608
02:25:57,581 --> 02:26:00,640
like I was watching the youth stream
that was not easy lifting said,

2609
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:02,830
but you are also as these lifting.
So I think he was your,

2610
02:26:03,070 --> 02:26:07,150
you think he's a great Jujitsu Guy? Oh
well he's the greatest ever. Hixon Gracie.

2611
02:26:07,151 --> 02:26:07,540
He's the,

2612
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:12,540
he's the like number one when you think
about like greatest martial artists in a

2613
02:26:12,761 --> 02:26:16,570
specific style for Jujitsu, everybody
says Hixon Gracie, it's universal.

2614
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:20,650
It's not like one person says it and
he's also his philosophy and everything.

2615
02:26:20,651 --> 02:26:24,550
So it was still was easy lifting because
I really admire the guy and it had real

2616
02:26:24,551 --> 02:26:28,120
questions and you know, I knew
him, I knew him for a while,

2617
02:26:28,121 --> 02:26:30,160
I've known him for awhile. I've
had dinner with them, you know,

2618
02:26:30,430 --> 02:26:32,470
gone over Jujitsu positions with them.
And then,

2619
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:36,340
and then watching you walk in right
when Eddie Bravo and him were discussing

2620
02:26:36,341 --> 02:26:39,520
positions and going over them on
the ground, that was cool as fuck.

2621
02:26:39,550 --> 02:26:43,300
But now it's still easy in comparison to
what radio lab does or in comparison to

2622
02:26:43,301 --> 02:26:44,740
what Dan Carlin does,

2623
02:26:44,741 --> 02:26:47,860
especially because he's got
to be historically correct
on all these things as

2624
02:26:47,861 --> 02:26:50,720
well. Think about all the different
time periods. He discusses all the,

2625
02:26:50,860 --> 02:26:54,190
he's got a read on them, do the research
on and make sure he's got all his, it's

2626
02:26:54,550 --> 02:26:58,180
fucking great.
You know what I want to do from an,

2627
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:01,510
I want to do an addition to my podcast
I've been talking about kind of.

2628
02:27:01,511 --> 02:27:05,110
I haven't really told anyone. Be Honest.
Be Honest. I know you will. Okay,

2629
02:27:05,590 --> 02:27:08,920
so my book did really well, but the
audio book did much better than the book.

2630
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:10,660
Of course people want to
hear me do audio books.

2631
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,950
So instead of doing another book,

2632
02:27:11,980 --> 02:27:15,640
I'm just going to release an
audio book for my second book,

2633
02:27:15,641 --> 02:27:20,641
which will be fiction with me as the
character and just do write a book about

2634
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:25,390
fiction book, audio
fiction book. About what?

2635
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:27,640
About the machine that machine goes,

2636
02:27:27,641 --> 02:27:31,120
takes a cruise and accidentally break
let's Somali pirates onto the tray under

2637
02:27:31,121 --> 02:27:33,910
the cruise ship and he's then
got to solve the mystery.

2638
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:36,410
Just hear the machine now the machine.

2639
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:40,180
So it'll all be based on my own reality
and lobby based in my own reality of

2640
02:27:40,181 --> 02:27:44,230
like were you when you came on to decide
very drunk but I love it. Xanax too.

2641
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:47,590
Nope, just drunk. That's
my idea. Well listen man,

2642
02:27:48,130 --> 02:27:52,920
just because I'm skeptical doesn't
mean it can't be amazing. I'll do,

2643
02:27:52,930 --> 02:27:57,430
I'll do it just like I'll ride it like a
book, like a fiction book. Cause I can't,

2644
02:27:57,431 --> 02:28:00,310
I can't do another fucking
memoir type book. Like I don't,

2645
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:02,860
I'm done stories where you can
do your thoughts on things.

2646
02:28:02,861 --> 02:28:04,570
You think a lot about shit. I can, but I,

2647
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:07,450
but I think it would be more fun
to like do a potential shortly.

2648
02:28:07,451 --> 02:28:11,790
Remember the book Fletch, like that
character or like saw the movie. I didn't,

2649
02:28:11,830 --> 02:28:13,420
I don't remember the book but,
but like I want to do,

2650
02:28:13,421 --> 02:28:16,380
but I want to do books like that where
the machine is a character who's got to

2651
02:28:16,381 --> 02:28:17,214
solve mysteries.

2652
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:20,680
Listen, if you are a passionate about
it, if you actually think it's fine,

2653
02:28:20,830 --> 02:28:22,160
you definitely make it funny.

2654
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:26,120
Yeah, sure. You could make it great. It's
just a matter of, you know, any idea,

2655
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:30,140
if you believe in it and you're creative
and you're good and you chase it down,

2656
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:33,020
it'll either live or it'll die.
I mean,

2657
02:28:33,021 --> 02:28:36,440
you could try it and it turned into dog
shit and then you abandoned and after a

2658
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:40,190
few weeks and laugh about it on the
podcast or it becomes awesome. You know,

2659
02:28:40,191 --> 02:28:41,120
that's possible too.

2660
02:28:41,370 --> 02:28:44,770
I've done some solo podcast where
it's just me talking and uh,

2661
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:47,790
and I was listening to one, like
a, to see if it was okay to post.

2662
02:28:47,791 --> 02:28:50,730
And my wife's like, this
is horse shit. I was like,

2663
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:55,270
it's me fucking know.
Oh singing a song about Pi.

2664
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:59,130
Like I was like, cause you getting weird
in your man cave it like, and I was like,

2665
02:28:59,190 --> 02:29:01,620
if I was a pirate, this is a song
I had saying, Oh that's so fun.

2666
02:29:01,650 --> 02:29:04,620
And so I started singing this pirate song,
but it doesn't sound like me,

2667
02:29:05,700 --> 02:29:10,370
but I'm fucking obviously getting weird.
And it's like we are pyre stove.

2668
02:29:10,371 --> 02:29:14,880
He's scary. He goes, we're hair look
so funny. Who is this? This is awful.

2669
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:16,840
This is your wife. Listen
to your podcast. No.

2670
02:29:17,010 --> 02:29:19,620
She walked into that and she was like,
oh cause I'm listening to it.

2671
02:29:19,621 --> 02:29:22,530
She would never expect it. I'm
listening to my own shit. She was like,

2672
02:29:22,531 --> 02:29:25,650
Oh this is horse shit. Who is this? I
go, are you being serious right now?

2673
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:29,760
She's like, yeah, it's
really bad. I go, it's me.

2674
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:33,560
She goes, what did she say after that?
She was like, who's [inaudible] podcast?

2675
02:29:33,570 --> 02:29:37,200
Who's podcasts we won? She goes, Benson's,
cause she thought I must've been high.

2676
02:29:37,270 --> 02:29:41,130
Right. And I was like, no,
this is my podcast. She's like,

2677
02:29:41,131 --> 02:29:43,920
this is what your podcast sounds like.
I go, no, this is what I did by myself.

2678
02:29:43,921 --> 02:29:48,360
I haven't released. She's like,
don't release it. Don't really sit.

2679
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:52,750
Meanwhile, people are like
on Twitter now you have to.

2680
02:29:54,210 --> 02:29:58,230
One of my buddies from the, uh, my book, I
was very honest. I used everyone's names.

2681
02:29:58,231 --> 02:30:01,650
I should not have done that.
I know I've got a lot of fucking flack,

2682
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:06,140
but one of the guys whose name I use in
the book maybe first and last first and

2683
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:10,410
land in the middle, in the
middle of that podcast,

2684
02:30:10,411 --> 02:30:14,430
he called and go, what the fuck? No, he
was cool. He was like, he was like, yeah,

2685
02:30:14,490 --> 02:30:15,870
I heard it was fuck it
was. He was like, yeah,

2686
02:30:15,871 --> 02:30:19,020
that's what everyone's been pissed
originally, but then they're like,

2687
02:30:19,170 --> 02:30:21,240
then they're like, yeah, I guess I
was a little slutty in high school.

2688
02:30:23,970 --> 02:30:27,600
Jenny powers sent me a book.
It was like was really upset.

2689
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:30,920
Didn't Lucy snore Bush get in
touch with Joey Diaz? Thanks.

2690
02:30:31,460 --> 02:30:32,690
Because the way you remember

2691
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:35,820
history, especially when you're
writing a book, you do very honest,

2692
02:30:36,250 --> 02:30:37,590
like I was just, I didn't
think anyone would. We'll

2693
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:38,680
read it.
Well,

2694
02:30:38,681 --> 02:30:41,980
the real problem also when it comes
to people's memories is that they're

2695
02:30:41,981 --> 02:30:46,360
terrible, minor, fucking horrible.
Nobody really remembers what I mean.

2696
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:50,530
You will talk to someone who has a
totally different memory of something.

2697
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:54,580
I've had conversations with people that
have totally different memories of shit

2698
02:30:54,581 --> 02:30:57,040
that did not,
it just did not go down that way.

2699
02:30:57,041 --> 02:30:58,930
It's not possible that
it went down that way.

2700
02:30:59,050 --> 02:31:01,120
And I'll explain to them
why it's not possible,

2701
02:31:01,121 --> 02:31:05,110
like physical hardcore reasons and
they'll keep going on about it.

2702
02:31:05,111 --> 02:31:07,300
Like it's a real thing. I'm like,
God damn it dude. It didn't happen.

2703
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:12,190
Bobby was dead in 86 like you'll tell him
he died in 80 you know he died in 1983

2704
02:31:12,191 --> 02:31:13,630
he was in a car accident.
This is,

2705
02:31:13,631 --> 02:31:15,790
we were talking about something that
happened three years after his death.

2706
02:31:15,791 --> 02:31:19,350
It didn't happen. Cause that happened
three years after his death. Yeah, no,

2707
02:31:19,351 --> 02:31:22,200
no mean he was their man.
He's fucking dead.

2708
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:27,060
He was dead and they don't, they won't
let it go. And they just, in their mind,

2709
02:31:27,061 --> 02:31:31,260
they have concocted this scenario.
They put these events in a,

2710
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:34,320
in a box and then it no
longer becomes their memory.

2711
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:36,840
It becomes them repeating the
stories over and over again.

2712
02:31:36,841 --> 02:31:38,940
And then there's the memory
of the repeated story.

2713
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:42,900
Your memories fucking terrible out,
up to a certain point.

2714
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:48,050
There's like certain very
traumatic moments that I
have reserved in my mind that

2715
02:31:49,531 --> 02:31:54,531
are like flashes and then I whatever
remembered is my recollection of those

2716
02:31:55,831 --> 02:32:00,540
ideas and what I've said about those
ideas. But those ideas themselves,

2717
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:02,730
like here's a perfect example.

2718
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:08,420
My entire taekwondo career from 1981 to
1988 fighting more than a hundred times.

2719
02:32:13,110 --> 02:32:18,030
I don't think I remember more than two
or three flashes of things happening

2720
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:22,650
really. Cause you from head injuries?
No, maybe for sure I have some of those,

2721
02:32:22,950 --> 02:32:27,570
but more, um, it just, I
don't know. I just, it just,

2722
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:30,600
I know what happened.
I know I won this tournament,

2723
02:32:30,601 --> 02:32:33,120
that tournament and no knock that guy out.
And I know this happened.

2724
02:32:33,121 --> 02:32:34,920
I know that was scary.
And I know this was scary.

2725
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:39,090
I know my friend got knocked out, but
my, my actual memories of those, like I,

2726
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:41,070
there's a video of, um, the,

2727
02:32:41,071 --> 02:32:44,070
the guy sent me of me knocking this
guy out with is turning sidekick.

2728
02:32:44,460 --> 02:32:47,220
And I remember that I knocked the
guy out with attorney sidekick.

2729
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:51,570
I remember that tournament. I'd want a
bunch of fights leading up to the finals.

2730
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:55,920
Um, and one of them was that knockout, but
I don't remember it actually happening.

2731
02:32:55,950 --> 02:32:58,440
I mean, I don't remember
it. I know it did happen,

2732
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:00,480
but like if I pulled into my mind,

2733
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:05,040
do I remember the guys coming at me and
I turn and the impact of the kick and

2734
02:33:05,041 --> 02:33:08,940
the guy goes flying? Nope. Nope. Don't
remember it at all. That was a pretty big,

2735
02:33:08,941 --> 02:33:12,990
it was a u s cup. It was a huge national
tournament was a big event. Nope,

2736
02:33:13,470 --> 02:33:17,220
barely remember it. That's so crazy.
That's life though. When I tell stories,

2737
02:33:17,230 --> 02:33:17,850
like if I talk,

2738
02:33:17,850 --> 02:33:22,680
like I've done some things where like
demonstrate kicks on somebody and they're

2739
02:33:22,681 --> 02:33:25,800
like, how the fuck can you
do this? And I'm like, well,

2740
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:27,990
I used to be a taekwondo champion.
I was,

2741
02:33:28,060 --> 02:33:32,040
I won the US Open and I'll start and
then almost I feel like I'm lying because

2742
02:33:32,041 --> 02:33:33,540
it's not me.
You know?

2743
02:33:33,541 --> 02:33:38,040
It's like the meat today is a totally
different person than the May event,

2744
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:39,420
but for whatever reason,

2745
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:44,070
the meat today has retained
all these skills that I
developed when I was younger.

2746
02:33:44,071 --> 02:33:47,460
I mean I never let them go,
but the fact that they exist at all in a,

2747
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:51,270
in a way that's impressive to
professionals is very strange.

2748
02:33:51,330 --> 02:33:55,920
So like demonstrate a kick, you know,
and show somebody and they're like,

2749
02:33:55,921 --> 02:33:58,800
how the fuck can you do this?
I guess I've always done it,

2750
02:33:58,980 --> 02:34:01,860
but I feel like I'm lying.
I feel like I didn't really do that.

2751
02:34:02,180 --> 02:34:05,040
Like I can't really do that, but I know
I can, do you know what I'm saying?

2752
02:34:05,041 --> 02:34:06,870
But I know exactly how
shitty my memory is.

2753
02:34:07,030 --> 02:34:08,920
I had someone today on a
meeting and they were like,

2754
02:34:08,921 --> 02:34:10,690
tell them how your career got
started. And so I said, well,

2755
02:34:10,691 --> 02:34:13,160
99 seven rolling stone magazine found
me and called me the number one party on

2756
02:34:13,161 --> 02:34:15,880
the hill country. And he was saying it as
I'm saying it, I go, I'm like, I'm like,

2757
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:19,300
honestly, I said, I thought they
said the day this is fucking insane.

2758
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:23,680
How could anyone prove that? Well, you,

2759
02:34:23,750 --> 02:34:26,060
they wrote a story and they
can research the story. No,

2760
02:34:26,110 --> 02:34:30,840
and you guys haven't read it.
No one's read. It was like
how many must've read it.

2761
02:34:31,510 --> 02:34:35,850
Has Anyone in this room? No, but, but,
but I'm telling them this is, by the way,

2762
02:34:35,851 --> 02:34:38,040
this is, I'm laying in bed
thinking this and then I'm like,

2763
02:34:38,041 --> 02:34:41,130
I'm the one that's telling everyone that
rolling stone magazine, no one read it.

2764
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:44,910
I mean, I have copies of it
at home. Uh, and, and it's,
it's, you can find it online,

2765
02:34:44,911 --> 02:34:47,340
you can read it online, but the
majority of people haven't read it.

2766
02:34:47,341 --> 02:34:51,480
They just take my word as, as me going.
And then I started thinking, what if,

2767
02:34:51,481 --> 02:34:54,720
what if I like, I got a panicked,
like what if I'm lying, but I'm not,

2768
02:34:54,721 --> 02:34:58,170
I know I'm not. But like it's
that same thing you said,
where you go, where you go.

2769
02:34:58,171 --> 02:35:02,310
I don't really remember. I remember small
details and stories. I can remember.

2770
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:07,050
I can remember sitting down the day I got
that magazine and I remember dust from

2771
02:35:07,051 --> 02:35:10,320
our couches came up and the sun was
coming through our top window at our

2772
02:35:10,330 --> 02:35:12,990
townhouse. And I remember seeing
dust particles flying up going.

2773
02:35:13,170 --> 02:35:14,790
One of my life's about to change.

2774
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:19,350
And I remember small details of stories
when I met Igor, Igor and Sasha,

2775
02:35:19,410 --> 02:35:21,210
Igor who is at the door when I met him,

2776
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:25,740
I remember that I was wearing a purple
Kelty fanny pack that had lemons,

2777
02:35:26,820 --> 02:35:29,460
sugar and a knife in it cause
I was going to do lemon drops.

2778
02:35:29,550 --> 02:35:32,820
I remember that distinctly because
I fell asleep on lemon drop.

2779
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:36,750
It's like dip sugar and lemon and then
you shoot vodka and then suck the sugar

2780
02:35:36,751 --> 02:35:41,040
and lemon tastes really good. It's like
a lemon drop was like a candy if it's,

2781
02:35:41,670 --> 02:35:44,580
oh I see, I see. I see. But like I
remember, I remember what I was wearing.

2782
02:35:44,670 --> 02:35:45,660
I remember what I was wearing.

2783
02:35:45,990 --> 02:35:47,850
I had told them I have a hundred
times when I was wearing the night.

2784
02:35:47,851 --> 02:35:48,960
We robbed the train and I,

2785
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:52,350
cause I remember I distinctly remember
and somebody showed me a picture of it

2786
02:35:52,410 --> 02:35:55,410
totally wrong. Totally wrong. Yeah.
I was wearing a white collared shirt.

2787
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:59,610
I was like, no, no, no. I was
wearing a blue Obermeyer ski jacket.

2788
02:35:59,611 --> 02:36:01,630
I wore that every single day in Russia,
isn't it?

2789
02:36:02,300 --> 02:36:04,740
Isn't it weird when someone
has fake memories? Have you,

2790
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:08,280
have you ever had that happen when
someone starts telling fake stories,

2791
02:36:08,281 --> 02:36:12,560
like fake memories of you and you're
like, what? I just say yes. Yeah,

2792
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:15,140
because I don't remember
people who were like,

2793
02:36:15,150 --> 02:36:18,150
remember the time you were in what you
would call it and you ripped your shirt

2794
02:36:18,151 --> 02:36:22,080
off? He brought me on stage.
I was in a diaper. Sure.

2795
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:25,140
That might have happened.
Like Mike Malone,

2796
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:28,740
you say an onstage and a
diaper and you and alcohol.

2797
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:30,753
You might have,

2798
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:35,010
someone told me that you brought Mike
balloon up in a diaper and you were,

2799
02:36:35,011 --> 02:36:39,120
and I was like, oh, doesn't sound like
me. It doesn't. It does a little bit,

2800
02:36:39,121 --> 02:36:41,820
but I just go, sounds like
you. To me, I go, sure.

2801
02:36:41,910 --> 02:36:45,090
It crazy is when you see a picture
of something you did and you're like,

2802
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:49,620
I have no recollection of
that. Yeah, yeah. Oh, totally.
Yeah. Yeah. That's weird.

2803
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:52,860
We've got some old old pictures from our
days at the comedy store that I totally

2804
02:36:52,861 --> 02:36:55,380
forgot about it. I'll see it.
I'll go, whoa, that's crazy.

2805
02:36:55,620 --> 02:36:58,140
Or some of the videos at Brian
took from back in the day.

2806
02:36:58,290 --> 02:37:01,050
You don't even a video of a,
the hooker that we talked to,

2807
02:37:01,360 --> 02:37:06,270
their crazy hooker founder a couple
of months ago. You found it. Yeah.

2808
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:08,820
You don't want, you want,
you know what I'd like,

2809
02:37:09,090 --> 02:37:11,460
I'd like to go back into
my memories with like, uh,

2810
02:37:11,580 --> 02:37:16,580
with some sort of Facebook tagging method
and remember who I met. I used to work,

2811
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:19,760
I used to work out at the comedy store
with Louie Anderson on Sunday nights.

2812
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:21,680
Did he ever try to fuck
you? Nope. Never wants,

2813
02:37:21,681 --> 02:37:25,610
but he still has my maid tape from a John
Favreau and Vince Vaughn made and gave

2814
02:37:25,611 --> 02:37:28,050
it to him. I was like, it's really good.
Watch it. And then he just kept it an aid.

2815
02:37:28,390 --> 02:37:32,580
No note made was a TV movie with
John Febrile, invincible. I was like,

2816
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:37,100
what you were doing, you were, you know,

2817
02:37:37,101 --> 02:37:40,060
you went with a dominatrix one time,
you were amazed.

2818
02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:43,130
It was something really
funny is, uh, and Louie,

2819
02:37:43,140 --> 02:37:44,860
I absolutely love you if
you are listening to this.

2820
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:46,790
He's the greatest guy in the world.
And,

2821
02:37:46,791 --> 02:37:50,270
but he had a heart attack during
that time and he was at Cedar Sinai.

2822
02:37:50,420 --> 02:37:53,660
And so I went to, uh, went to
go visit him and I was like,

2823
02:37:53,661 --> 02:37:56,840
I'm here to see Louie Anderson. It
was like, and they were like, Ugh,

2824
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:59,610
like another one up to the top,
like above.

2825
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:01,900
Apparently a bunch of boys
were just coming in and now,

2826
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:07,730
but like I went up to see him. There were
like three dudes in the room. Fuck yeah,

2827
02:38:07,731 --> 02:38:12,530
get yours. Um, wait, what was
I going to say before that? Oh,

2828
02:38:12,590 --> 02:38:13,790
I would like to go through and go,

2829
02:38:13,791 --> 02:38:17,270
cause I remember sitting in the back
with a bunch of guys that worked at the

2830
02:38:17,271 --> 02:38:18,110
comedy store.
Now,

2831
02:38:18,111 --> 02:38:20,870
I know that those guys were all
the people that I'm friends with.

2832
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:25,340
It's probably Dunkin and, and like
all those guys probably work there.

2833
02:38:25,550 --> 02:38:28,040
And they were telling me how funny I was
and then I should start working at the

2834
02:38:28,041 --> 02:38:32,480
comedy store. But I didn't know the
hierarchy that these were all comics.

2835
02:38:32,481 --> 02:38:34,090
I just thought they worked at the club.
She,

2836
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:36,770
I gave them like the passing off of
like, Oh, thank you very much man.

2837
02:38:36,771 --> 02:38:39,440
I appreciate it guys. And they're
like, no man, you should work here.

2838
02:38:39,441 --> 02:38:42,440
Like this is your club. You would
be good here. And I was like,

2839
02:38:42,441 --> 02:38:44,210
I really appreciate that.
Thank you guys.

2840
02:38:44,300 --> 02:38:46,800
I would love to go back and find
out who I was talking to. That's

2841
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,780
wild.
I wonder who that was.

2842
02:38:49,410 --> 02:38:52,710
I drove around Louie Anderson's boy
toy once when I was driving limos,

2843
02:38:53,490 --> 02:38:56,730
when I just started doing
standup comedy. Um, this, uh,

2844
02:38:57,900 --> 02:39:00,810
this fella, uh, Louie
had some sort of a thing.

2845
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:03,690
He was a young guy and uh,

2846
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:07,320
like I would just have to drive
this guy anywhere he wanted to go.

2847
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:10,680
And we were both around the same age. I
mean this fella, I won't say his name,

2848
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:14,910
but do I know him now? I don't
think so. He was a comic sort of,

2849
02:39:15,090 --> 02:39:19,560
and he actually wound up writing a
book and went to jail for something,

2850
02:39:19,561 --> 02:39:21,120
some fraud thing or something like that.

2851
02:39:21,121 --> 02:39:23,880
Cause I remember I wrote
loosely paid attention to him.

2852
02:39:24,030 --> 02:39:27,300
And then when you could find people
in the news like Google people,

2853
02:39:27,301 --> 02:39:28,960
it was before Google,
it was like, you know,

2854
02:39:29,490 --> 02:39:34,260
some fucking net gear search
or some point family. Who was,

2855
02:39:34,261 --> 02:39:35,094
what the fuck used?

2856
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:39,780
W W was the early searches
searches though crawler,

2857
02:39:40,130 --> 02:39:44,250
uh, [inaudible]. Anyway, this, this guy,

2858
02:39:45,030 --> 02:39:48,510
I remember reading about
something that he did. He,

2859
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:51,810
he had some sort of a thing that was
getting attention like a book or something

2860
02:39:51,811 --> 02:39:54,270
like that and then you want
up going to jail. But uh,

2861
02:39:54,630 --> 02:39:57,990
I was driving him around like I'd have
to take him to the mall and take the end.

2862
02:39:57,991 --> 02:39:58,801
He would just tell me,

2863
02:39:58,801 --> 02:40:01,710
you know how he's opening for Louie
Anderson and Louie Anderson's,

2864
02:40:01,711 --> 02:40:04,230
his friend and this, I had no idea.
And Louie Anderson, it was gay,

2865
02:40:04,530 --> 02:40:07,440
but halfway through driving
this kid around and were like,

2866
02:40:07,441 --> 02:40:10,500
this kid is gay as fuck. Like
there's something going on. It was,

2867
02:40:10,710 --> 02:40:14,730
it was not just that he was,
it was like I driving around a bimbo.

2868
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:17,250
It was like,
you know,

2869
02:40:17,251 --> 02:40:21,450
if you were like some rich
oligarch and you had some,

2870
02:40:21,451 --> 02:40:25,010
a little piece of ass on the side that
you were, you know like, hey honey,

2871
02:40:25,011 --> 02:40:28,560
you know, you want to fucking drive
these guide, take you to store, you know,

2872
02:40:28,561 --> 02:40:31,560
you do what you want. It was that
sort of a scenario where, you know,

2873
02:40:31,561 --> 02:40:35,640
he was like real cocky and talent,

2874
02:40:35,641 --> 02:40:38,160
like giving me advice on, on comedy. Like,

2875
02:40:38,161 --> 02:40:40,680
well Louie Anderson doesn't like
this and this is what Louis does.

2876
02:40:40,681 --> 02:40:44,280
This is Louise thoughts on, and when
I opened for Louie and I'm like, wow,

2877
02:40:44,370 --> 02:40:47,830
Ben bail, you know Ben Bailey? Yes. He
just Kinda, he did it does catch your eye.

2878
02:40:47,831 --> 02:40:50,280
But he's a kid. He's a comic. I
mean, he's like are legit comic.

2879
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:54,420
As long as I've known him a
in New York comic, he gave,

2880
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,880
he bought Louis Anderson,

2881
02:40:56,910 --> 02:41:00,570
he saw Louie Anderson and then it was
like father's day was the next day.

2882
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:03,210
And so he bought his book and then said,
Lou,

2883
02:41:03,211 --> 02:41:04,890
will you sign this and
make this out to my dad?

2884
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:06,870
I'm going to give it to him for
father's Day. So he signed it,

2885
02:41:06,871 --> 02:41:10,260
just give it to his dad and Ben
gave it to his dad for father's Day.

2886
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:14,430
And then like the next day Ben's Dad
is like, I'm flipping through the book.

2887
02:41:14,470 --> 02:41:19,320
You want to talk? Ben's like, no.
He's like, okay, are you sure?

2888
02:41:19,380 --> 02:41:21,300
Cause I'll talk to you. I
love you. And it's like, no,

2889
02:41:21,301 --> 02:41:24,300
I'm sure the book is all about
coming out to your father.

2890
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:29,110
There
was like,

2891
02:41:29,350 --> 02:41:32,240
I'm okay. I think I'm good. Who Was it?

2892
02:41:32,270 --> 02:41:35,340
Was it on the podcast that
someone told us a story about uh,

2893
02:41:35,440 --> 02:41:38,780
Louis cornering them in their hotel room?
Who the fuck was it?

2894
02:41:40,070 --> 02:41:42,770
I don't think it was on the podcast.
I know what you're talking about.

2895
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:45,950
[inaudible] no, no, I think this trip.

2896
02:41:47,620 --> 02:41:50,780
All right, let's just let it go.
That's the one we're just talking.

2897
02:41:50,781 --> 02:41:55,270
We just got done talking about how bad
our memories are and then we're about to

2898
02:41:55,310 --> 02:41:59,450
shame someone. It was Stan hope. I see his
picture right there. Are you serious? No,

2899
02:41:59,510 --> 02:42:01,310
no.
Definitely not standard.

2900
02:42:01,710 --> 02:42:06,400
Stan. Stan hope has turned spit
takes us into a game at our kitchen,

2901
02:42:06,580 --> 02:42:08,110
in our liver, in our, uh, for dinner.

2902
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:10,780
What do you mean Stan hope
we then I did a podcast,

2903
02:42:10,781 --> 02:42:14,500
it was like fucking epic for our podcasts.
He told me he fell in love with you.

2904
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:17,250
I fell in love with it so quickly I had,

2905
02:42:17,590 --> 02:42:21,640
but he came and sat and had dinner with
my family. Right. And they were like,

2906
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:24,640
when we play games at the table
and Doug's like, I got a game,

2907
02:42:25,090 --> 02:42:28,000
let's play spit takes. And they're
like, how do you play spit takes now.

2908
02:42:28,001 --> 02:42:32,710
Leanne is not like my wife's Pr, like
pretty regular mom. And he's like,

2909
02:42:32,711 --> 02:42:33,730
well I'll tell a joke.

2910
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:36,430
And when you think the punchlines hit
you spit out what you're drinking.

2911
02:42:36,610 --> 02:42:40,090
And island Georgia, we're like fuck yet.
Go. So Doug, we'll sell a joke, you know,

2912
02:42:40,091 --> 02:42:44,770
as I. Dot I. Dot. Penis. I
said, tell bench penis and
they both spit their drinks.

2913
02:42:44,771 --> 02:42:45,670
He's like,
good job.

2914
02:42:45,671 --> 02:42:48,970
And so everyone would tell a joke and
everyone do spit takes and the best as

2915
02:42:48,971 --> 02:42:52,510
they got to Doug and eyelid told
Doug a joke. I had it on video too,

2916
02:42:52,511 --> 02:42:57,480
but I lost my phone and Doug and Doug
does the drink in Iowa says.dot, dot,

2917
02:42:57,481 --> 02:43:01,270
dot. Dot. That's how a frog, it's across
the road. And Doug didn't do a spit test.

2918
02:43:01,271 --> 02:43:04,420
She goes, Doug, you didn't
have spit taken. He goes, you
don't spit off vodka, honey.

2919
02:43:07,170 --> 02:43:10,070
Eila played mustard hands with him.
She goes, you won't play mustard hands.

2920
02:43:10,190 --> 02:43:11,410
He's like, how do you play? She's like,

2921
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:14,470
you take mustard and you put squirt it
in your hands under the table and you

2922
02:43:14,471 --> 02:43:17,230
either have Methuen mustard in your
hands or you don't. And that's the game.

2923
02:43:17,620 --> 02:43:19,930
And dogs like, I'm fucking
in and lands like, no,

2924
02:43:20,050 --> 02:43:23,770
I can't get mustered out of
clothes. No. And Doug's like,
don't be a bitch. Come on.

2925
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:27,780
Now. I don't know if he said that, but
you know, you know Doug, he told he,

2926
02:43:27,860 --> 02:43:31,720
he Leanne stepped on the eyelids
punchlines and I started crying and Doug

2927
02:43:31,721 --> 02:43:34,960
defended Aila. He's like, that's
what it feels like to get heckled.

2928
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:39,670
That island dope. He was the
coolest fucking night I've ever had.

2929
02:43:39,671 --> 02:43:43,470
I'm going to go to Hawaii. My wife was
getting shot down and bitched at. Well,

2930
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:46,730
yeah, you can't get what you get.
You don't get upset. Zip It, lock it,

2931
02:43:46,731 --> 02:43:49,780
stick in your pocket. You know, you get,
you know, get upset. We got to go, man.

2932
02:43:49,781 --> 02:43:51,280
We've got to wrap this up.

2934

by a bunch of freaks.

2935
02:43:56,850 --> 02:43:59,470

Hundreds of people show up. I want to
