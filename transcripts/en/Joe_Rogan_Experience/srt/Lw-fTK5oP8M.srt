1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,041
Well,

3
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:05,670
the reason you key I and shout is to
create intrabdominal pressure so you can

4
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:06,540
stabilize the system.

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,100
Maybe you not me.

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,780
You sound like you use magic bro.

7
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,910
When I'm key I a you throw fireballs,

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,620
the shrine in my mind.

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,920
So the third thing is that we create,

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,150
we screw the feet into the ground,

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:18,751
right?

12
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,540
This torsion of kind of
creating grip through the,

13
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,430
through the like the same sort of grip
you go towards no externally rotate,

14
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:26,970
right?

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,510
That's right.

16
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,410
Wax On.

17
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:31,950
Wax Off was teaching what Steven Seagal
always throws in the same position,

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,530
screwing a light bulb
minutes the way he runs on,

19
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,500
look at the way he runs.

20
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,583
You ever see him run?

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,940
That's a perfect example.

22
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,230
Pull up Steven Seagal running.

23
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:40,881
Let's see.

24
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:44,790
It's a perfect example of see if Kelly
can fix the way Steven Seagal runs and

25
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,510
this is no back to the Stevens.

26
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,010
Augustine's number to call is an excellent
martial artist and he's very good at

27
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:50,490
Ikea.

28
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,330
I mean he was one of the first Japanese
Americans rather to teach in Japan.

29
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,310
This right had a
legitimate respected Dojo.

30
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,630
So now Kido is,

31
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,420
has they figured out to throw people,

32
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,400
you're wining the shoulder
up into what position?

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,473
This extra.

34
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,170
Yeah,

35
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,570
and then you have to tremendous
amount of power with that.

36
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,790
US wells with judo.

37
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,530
Same position that's rolled.

38
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,860
Getting getting yourself in a position.

39
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,083
We'll get him running.

40
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,480
Tell,

41
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,320
tell me what's wrong here.

42
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,370
Everything is wrong.

43
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,331
He has a lot wrong.

44
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:16,164
They're right.

45
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,000
Ge taught him how to run the Louis.

46
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:18,570
He's,

47
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,740
he's got to look at this.

48
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,430
Look how he's running.

49
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,263
Actually,

50
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,780
you know,

51
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,411
it's not bad.

52
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,670
He's running on the ball of his foot.

53
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,880
I've seen why worse.

54
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,110
Let's back now he's getting older.

55
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:28,944
He's getting over extended.

56
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,251
Oh,

57
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:29,721
you got it.

58
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:29,960
Yeah.

59
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,300
And that this is different.

60
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,540
This is this.

61
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,001
This is a,

62
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:33,661
this is the guy who started,

63
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,820
gets stiff and fly around and
play a little too much music.

64
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,080
Everybody talks shit about him.

65
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:37,891
But the dude,

66
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:38,491
he's a bad ass.

67
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:39,900
Legitimate martial artists.

68
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,520
He knows a lot about Marshall.

69
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,140
I wanted to be a navy seal cook.

70
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,260
If after I saw where this police don't
Machita legitimately takes advice from

71
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:46,621
that guy.

72
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:50,460
Everybody thinks it's bullshit and they
think I'm just trolling Lubick Liotta

73
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,640
Machita respects that guy enough to take
instruction from him and to listen to

74
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:54,310
him talk.

75
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,510
Why?

76
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,961
Why wouldn't,

77
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,350
I mean he figured a lot
things out the keys.

78
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,710
A lot of us don't have sort of the Meta
cognition where I want to see if he runs

79
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:02,544
on his toes though.

80
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,170
I need to see that ball of the foot.

81
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:04,681
So let's,

82
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,350
let's take a couple of conversations
with all the foot is good ball.

83
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,881
Let's be clear.

84
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,691
Let's see how he's running.

85
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:10,770
There was either running,

86
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,391
no,

87
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:12,121
we're not running.

88
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,520
He'll first man guys breast out.

89
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,081
He's hitting.

90
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:15,720
He'll first.

91
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,380
No Way.

92
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,711
No Way.

93
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:17,840
That's actually not
gonna stop that running.

94
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,101
Okay,

95
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:18,220
look,

96
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,350
it's crazy.

97
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,900
That guy is flat footed.

98
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:22,521
When he's landing,

99
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,440
he is running terrible and
your foot flat footed is okay.

100
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,430
What's not okay?

101
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,200
Ball of the foot strikes first.

102
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,801
That's not okay.

103
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,480
That's okay.

104
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,621
Oh,

105
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:29,820
that's,

106
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,290
there's some variation
that what he's doing.

107
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,770
Well,

108
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,431
it's hard to tell.

109
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:32,761
I'm talking,

110
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,594
it's not hard to tell him.

111
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,770
He's moving really fast.

112
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:35,431
I'm talking shit.

113
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,350
I mean it might have been all the foot.

114
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:37,661
Here's what,

115
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:38,494
here's what I would think.

116
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,940
That's less efficient.

117
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:42,774
What's going on now?

118
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,613
What's all that about?

119
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,640
Unstable.

120
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,210
Unstable,

121
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,960
so unstable.

122
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,600
And that's what he's,

123
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,411
he's looking for.

124
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:47,940
He's,

125
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,680
that's how we use this
as like Quito though.

126
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,101
He's all,

127
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,270
he's like with like,

128
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,481
oh,

129
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,160
so you mean practice makes permanent?

130
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,720
This is that a whole bunch.

131
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:55,580
And that's the only way.

132
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,910
So even when he runs,

133
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,590
he's got that sort of whipping
motion going on when his arms,

134
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,321
it kind of makes sense.

135
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:00,941
So totally.

136
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,870
We teach people to run.

137
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,231
We say,

138
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:02,620
hey,

139
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,000
pretend like you're grabbing two chips.

140
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,983
Right?

141
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,310
Put your shoulders in this position.

142
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,980
This extra rotated position
makes you shoulder stable.

143
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,510
It creates the building in the head.

144
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,490
What you'll see is that
people are on your chips,

145
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:12,970
man.

146
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,670
Chips.

147
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,730
Like you have two potentials.

148
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,550
Don't cross the chips.

149
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,240
Two of them.

150
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,270
Imagine that you're grabbing
something else and you don't.

151
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,233
You want to be gentle.

152
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,930
Right?

153
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,290
Right.

154
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:20,681
Can you say,

155
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:21,970
why would you say my name is Coco?

156
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,541
I don't understand.

157
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,240
Like pull your elbows tight.

158
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:25,660
No,

159
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:25,901
this is,

160
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,734
this is how you should be running.

161
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,570
You're just holding onto the ships.

162
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,220
This is how you'd run
a protect those checks.

163
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:30,550
So where,

164
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,870
where was his hands going?

165
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:32,704
Across his body.

166
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,450
So how much force is he given away?

167
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:34,840
All of that.

168
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,010
So my hands coming across,

169
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:36,701
I got to stop that.

170
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,540
It's a heavy load.

171
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,770
I want to minimize that.

172
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,660
