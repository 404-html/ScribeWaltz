1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,040
The joe rogan experience I went to,
I was uh,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,550
when I was a seal recruiter,
I got invited to mit smart ass

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,600
motherfuckers there,
man,

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:14,220
I'm not that on the cigarette animal
dming knuckle dragger and um,

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,370
he was just guide the,
I forget his name but he was like the

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,160
top head head guy,
old white guy,

7
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:20,994
you know,
all,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,990
all genius doubt.
And we were on this panel and they were

9
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,210
asking us all these questions about the
mind,

10
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:29,220
mental toughness and shit.
He was answering them and I wasn't

11
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:33,000
answering any questions and I'll never
forget he was just answered them off of

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,000
theory.
He never put his fucking ass and shit.

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,600
You read a bunch of fucking books and
you think that you know how to fucking

14
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,330
mine works and shit.
I had gone through hell to get the kid

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,580
and then all the way up until now.

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,050
So I know.
So that theory is bullshit.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,970
Yeah,
there's a lot of good stuff out there.

18
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:55,800
You can read from people,
but I had lived hell and when you put

19
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,890
yourself in hill,
that's the only time you can figure out

20
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,580
how the fuck to get through that
motherfucker.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,240
You can't,
you can't read somebody else's book

22
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:06,990
about some theory on how to do shit.
Some guy who set up in there a nice warm

23
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:10,710
office in [inaudible] and wrote some
book with a Nice Cup of coffee in the

24
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:11,544
fucking hand.
No,

25
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,910
I want to see that guy who immerse
themselves in fucking hell and he

26
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,650
thought about quitting and leaving and
and,

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,900
and his wife and his kids.
And why am I here?

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,220
It says,
is it worth it?

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,200
All this crazy shit.
It still said if found out a way to get

30
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,640
through it.
So basically that's the,

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,060
that's the bottom line of it all.

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,110
We all want to read about how we can
quickly get somewhere.

33
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,330
That's why there's six minute abs and
all sorts of Shit.

34
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,290
So powerful did you may get some results
from it,

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,070
but they're not permanent.
The permanent result comes from you

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,930
fucking,
I say it all time.

37
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,080
You have to suffer.
You have to make that a tattoo on your

38
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,960
fucking brain.
So when that hard time comes again,

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,070
you don't forget it.
You may forget it for a second,

40
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,870
but you can go back in the cookie jar.
I call it.

41
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,810
It's a,
it's something that we've all endured.

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,110
I call it the cookie jar and we often
forget how hard we are,

43
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,330
but you got to reflect back,
take a couple of seconds,

44
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,560
reflect,
I've been through this,

45
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:18,561
I've been through that and then remind
yourself I'm a bad motherfucker and then

46
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,030
you can get through that shit.
But if you don't believe it,

47
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,990
you haven't endorsed Shit,
you're just blowing smoke.

48
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,480
Man.
I think there is a lesson because I

49
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,630
think that what we did actually was,
um,

50
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,080
fairly simple,
which was we played it by ear and the

51
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,330
stuff that didn't work,
we chucked it.

52
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,670
And the stuff that did work,
we augmented it.

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,130
And so there are no hard and fast rules.
Yeah.

54
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,810
You're also banking people.
You're both very unusually smart and

55
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:49,320
open minded with each other.
We found each other.

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,660
I think open mindedness point,
important and smart.

57
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,870
In this case,
I didn't like being able to look at each

58
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,820
other with compassion.
You know,

59
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:59,040
this is true for any interaction,
right?

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,153
Let's,
Oh,

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,930
can I look at you and see you as a human
being with real emotions and feelings

62
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,710
and reality to your experiences as well,
even if I feel like we disagree

63
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:10,060
completely.
So even,

64
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,220
you know,
even when we're at our angriest with

65
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,430
each other,
if we can see each other's humanity

66
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,020
through it and you get through.

67
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,970
Yeah.
Dot.

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,410
That is a lesson for every human being
in all walks of life,

69
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,780
in any situation.
When you disagree with someone,

70
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,020
not just your lover,
not just a friend,

71
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,090
but people that you don't even know,
it's,

72
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,810
it's very easy to dehumanize someone who
disagrees with you.

73
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,330
And I think to bring this all back
around,

74
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,660
this is a part of the problem with a
male female interaction today is this

75
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,590
dehumanization on both sides.
That the men are demons,

76
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,510
that the woman are this and the men of
that.

77
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,920
And it's all this,
you know,

78
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:55,240
it's these rash generalizations in this
extreme tribalism.

79
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,813
Well,
yes.

80
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,860
Um,
there is kind of a secret weapon and I,

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,880
it's not going to seek it out.
The secret is,

82
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,180
uh,
heather and I have a whole second

83
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:13,830
channel on which to navigate,
which is that we both know the same

84
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:15,780
evolutionary story.
Yeah.

85
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,010
There's a way,
you know,

86
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,930
here's a,
an idea that's important.

87
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,910
You can very often understand more about
a given human interaction,

88
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:27,690
especially a contentious one if you turn
down the sound,

89
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,270
right?
So you can't hear what's being said and

90
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,850
that sounds wrong,
right?

91
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,693
Sounds like,
well,

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,730
maybe the most important piece of
information you could have is what these

93
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:38,100
people are saying to each other as
they're arguing.

94
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,800
But no,
that's not how human beings work.

95
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,780
Sometimes the important information is
on that vocal channel and sometimes the

96
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:49,260
vocal channel is actually almost purely
noise.

97
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,470
Right?
And so if both literally and

98
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:56,100
metaphorically,
but if heather and I both know that,

99
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,150
then there's a part of us that's sort of
always outside if we,

100
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,530
I mean,
we don't fight that much.

101
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,360
It's really pretty rare.
But,

102
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,770
um,
when we do,

103
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,120
there's also a part of us that's
watching the interaction and um,

104
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,670
knows that a certain pattern may have to
unfold in order for us to get to the

105
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:15,690
other part of it.
You know,

106
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,900
sometimes heather needs to be engaging
in theater at some level,

107
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,720
even though neither of us wants to be.
That's a great way to put it.

108
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,290
Engaging in couples theater.
It is,

109
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,630
and it is,
it's actually,

110
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,690
it's the perfect example of this thing.
Like,

111
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,180
you know,
you're talking about Peterson and go

112
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,150
into work and wearing makeup and you
think,

113
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,370
am I sending sexual signals?
Will,

114
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,040
Gosh,
we're all involved in weird stuff.

115
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,740
Right?
The idea that you and your mate could

116
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,350
both be aware that your argument is in
some,

117
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,600
in some way theater and that even,
you know,

118
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,311
you might think,
well,

119
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:48,720
if it's theater,
we can just skip it.

120
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,883
No,
you can't.

121
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,950
No.
There are things that have to happen in

122
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:54,900
order for you to get to the next act.

123
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,540
There were so many of those guys.
I mean,

124
00:05:56,541 --> 00:06:00,590
how many did we start out with that were
alcoholics or former alcoholics?

125
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,910
Yeah.
Fucking everybody.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,530
All of them.
Yeah.

127
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,360
And they're all,
and that was the thing about when you

128
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,360
were an open or a Boston,
it was like the criteria,

129
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:13,250
where are you funny enough to cover 15
minutes to open number two,

130
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,120
do you have a functioning automobile
that you can take these Dui headliners

131
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:20,510
to the Gig with?
Because none of them had licenses.

132
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,450
So I can remember like picking up Gavin
pickin up,

133
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,800
Sweeney picking up Mike Mcdonald's and
having to drive these guys out to

134
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,710
wherever and then you couldn't leave
early cause you were driving them home.

135
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,470
They'd give you a few bucks for gas and
you were happy to do it.

136
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,310
You're like,
Holy Shit,

137
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,580
I'm going to be in a car with don yet.
And so one time nick's Nick's comedy.

138
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,160
Stop calling me up and they're like,
you're working in Framingham.

139
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,860
You get to drive the feature and the
headliner out.

140
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,050
And I go downtown to pick them up in
front of Nick's and I've got a a,

141
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,070
I had a 1976 Volkswagen Rabbit,
four cylinder rusted out floorboards and

142
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,330
I get down there and it's Mike Sullivan
Irwin who weighed about 300 pounds and

143
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:04,841
John Pinette who is about to 75 and they
saw my car and they both started

144
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,870
giggling like schoolgirls like we're
going to fucking go to a Gig and this

145
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:09,930
car.
So we've,

146
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,560
we pack them in and as I couldn't get
on,

147
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:16,310
I couldn't get the car going above like
40 so instead of taking the mass pike at

148
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,700
west of Framingham,
I had to take a route nine the whole

149
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:21,800
way.
The open,

150
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:25,730
get it packed.
Hilarious.

151
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:30,731
Like you carrying lumber on the roof.
Fucking 800 pounds of humans in my car.

152
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,990
That's crazy.
Yeah.

153
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,920
Interesting.
Was this stupid ad you have to watch for

154
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,740
the Olympics there?
Boy,

155
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm,
this Olympics is,

156
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,960
I think I'm going to say this.
I think the Olympics are gross.

157
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,670
This is why I think the Olympics are
gross.

158
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,740
I think it's a great opportunity for all
those athletes.

159
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:52,240
I think it's great for people to watch
it,

160
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,250
but I think it is a fucking disgusting
money grab and all those amateur air

161
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:00,100
quotes.
Athletes don't get paid shit and these

162
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:03,370
companies are making billions and
billions of dollars off of them and I

163
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,950
really wish they would all quit.
I really wished they would say,

164
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:08,770
fuck you pay me.
I really wished they would just go

165
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,950
straight ray Liotta they give you pain.
Me,

166
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,230
they'd get up there.
They're youth for the,

167
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,990
not only that,
the fucking companies,

168
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,950
they're so restrictive,
they're the IOC and all the people that

169
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:25,870
are behind it are so restrictive and
they are making ungodly sums of money,

170
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,940
ungodly contracts.

171
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,970
They're just giant contracts to air the,
the Olympics,

172
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,540
giant amounts of money to build the
stadiums and set up.

173
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:38,470
These are these events and that
everything is about net nationalism and

174
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:41,290
national pride,
whether it's in Korea or Russia or

175
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,830
wherever the fuck they do them.
But meanwhile the athletes don't get

176
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,540
dick.
They don't get Dick.

177
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,100
If you're lucky and you're Michael
Phelps,

178
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:51,010
he become famous out of it and you get a
bunch of commercials,

179
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
commercials and endorsements and you
make a shit load of money that way.

180
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:56,970
But how many Michael Phelps are there?
There's a three or four.

181
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,470
I mean how many,
but how many in the,

182
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,510
all the,
all the Olympics and out of all the

183
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,560
Olympics.
Jamie,

184
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:06,180
you're a sports fan at all the Olympics,
say like the Olympics this year.

185
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,830
Well,
let's go the last one.

186
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,340
Who the fuck came out of it?
Where they're a household name?

187
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,590
Oh yeah.
Right now you've got shaun white and

188
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,600
maybe I heard of that guy.
The girl that won,

189
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,350
uh,
Kim is her last name on the border.

190
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,030
Right.
Bronze last night or two nights before

191
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,910
the real famous.
There's Lindsey Vaughn,

192
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,220
she's very famous.
She's very famous that she,

193
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,730
she used to date tiger woods.
Yeah.

194
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,610
That made her famous too.
Plus she's hot.

195
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,350
That makes her famous.
It's peekaboo street shit.

196
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,870
Interesting names.
So like helped her.

197
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,220
She's a gold medal winner,
I believe.

198
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,890
How many other ones are there is a few.
I mean,

199
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:40,200
it's just like a handful.
They can build a story around someone

200
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,860
and then they cancel story.
But when you get to the point where it's

201
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,900
worthwhile to sacrifice your entire life
and it actually pays off,

202
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,370
what are the,
what are the odds?

203
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:54,600
It's so fucking small.
But meanwhile people are tuning in to

204
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:55,434
all of it.

205
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,530
They're making massive amounts of
revenue from all of it.

206
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,600
And they're not sharing it with the
athletes at all.

207
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,540
I think it's fucking gross.
They pretend it's amateur,

208
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,860
different tenants and amateur.
It's a Goddamn motherfucking business.

209
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,260
That's what the Olympics are.
Well about college business too.

210
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,490
You can shit basketball and football.
Really?

211
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,880
NCAA says student athletes shouldn't be
paid because the 13th amendment allows

212
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:23,550
unpaid prison labor.
What the fuck?

213
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,570
Oh,
that's Shaun King.

214
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,450
This is great.
This is a,

215
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,890
this is another article.
This was the main,

216
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,480
main one going around.
But there's uh,

217
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,710
uh,
that's crazy.

218
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,630
Did they really say that?
Did they really say that?

219
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:36,360
The 13th amendment,
which allows unpaid prison labor,

220
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,930
they decided in a lawsuit a response to
a motion to dismiss and they,

221
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,270
that's what they use this though.
So disgusting.

222
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
They're so disgusting.
They're the same to me.

223
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,450
Ncaa College football and basketball,
same thing to me.

224
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,400
They have 180 of those hundred thousand
people.

225
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,260
Yeah.
Fuck you pay those guys,

226
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,610
pay him,
pay those girls,

227
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,860
pay all those athletes.
You're making money,

228
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,900
you're making money,
and you're not sharing it with the

229
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:59,550
athletes.
They might as well be slaves.

230
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,940
They might as well be fucking prisoners,
the Olympics,

231
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,410
Ncaa,
all that shit.

232
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,440
It's just these no way.
There's no way you could do that fresh

233
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:12,660
today.
Have you started from scratch today and

234
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,730
said,
we're going to get make billions of

235
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,970
dollars and we're going to give you uhmm
God.

236
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,780
Gotcha.
Cool.

237
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,453
There was no way.

238
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,400
Yeah.
