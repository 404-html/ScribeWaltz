1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,420
That's what a professional does.
Professional turns that bitch down down.

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:09,040
Huh?
A nonprofessional or someone who's half

3
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,190
ass in it.
They keep that phone up.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,340
Really?
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,710
Have you seen that?
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,860
Some people keep that phone up,
that check that phone on time.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,690
They'll check in the middle of podcasts.
Russell.

8
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:22,170
Peter can't leave his phone alone to
really try again through a fucking whole

9
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,960
podcast with Russell Peters without
checking his tweets.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,790
What?
Impossible.

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,520
Impossible.
He's checking things.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,120
Some days you read off tweets and say,
oh people.

13
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:35,790
Oh Doug Benson used to do that.
That's why.

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,430
Can't read off the tweets.
I'm trying to get away from it.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,560
If I can't,
I'll find times if I'm going to go eat

16
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,820
now,
I'll leave it in my phone,

17
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:45,090
in the car.
Power move and hadn't done that before.

18
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:48,300
I just started and it's not even a
natural choice I'm making almost.

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,060
It's like something I need to do.
Yeah.

20
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:52,740
To chicken shit.
Move scared.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,220
Scared to leave it in there.
Yeah.

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,070
Scared.
Scared.

23
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,660
Lead that foam would have some
important.

24
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:00,930
I asked if I needed to know,
but there isn't.

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,840
There is a thing like what if something
important happens?

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,830
Yeah,
but what do you think like when does

27
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:09,240
that happen?
Super Rare.

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,690
But if it did happen where your phone
was in the car and somebody needed you,

29
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:13,950
you'd feel terrible.
Right.

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,070
But you can just.
What is the,

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,740
what's the balance?
It's so slippery when we didn't have any

32
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:21,120
way to get in touch with back in the
day.

33
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:22,770
You have to yell for help.
Remember that?

34
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,050
Yeah.
You can't yell how?

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,860
Yeah.
Not in Los Angeles.

36
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,140
There's too many people.
You yell for help.

37
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,080
Nobody's in some languages helped mean
something else.

38
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,560
I think it's,
you know,

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,500
something not good at or something in
Arabic or something.

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,170
People will fuck you up.
You just make that up.

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,020
I'm not sure.
Honestly,

42
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,590
I think I might've heard that because I
live in Westwood and we have a very

43
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,570
diverse over there.
There's a lot of people sometimes

44
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:49,680
yelling stuff in the street.
Do you think a for real do you think

45
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:52,230
help mean something bad in other
languages?

46
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,010
So real.
Somebody told me hello means go to hell

47
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:58,080
in like Greek or Latin,
like,

48
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:02,040
um,
like politics means like a political,

49
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,903
like,
uh,

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,440
like um,
something like not good,

51
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,320
like something tick,
like a tick,

52
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:11,250
like blood sucking.
Oh really?

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,070
The government or something like that.
Let's start with one.

54
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,040
Let's start with,
uh,

55
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,060
should we do it with hello first?
Yeah,

56
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,460
I think because,
and I just say things and I don't even

57
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:26,160
know sometimes think somebody just told
me to say hello when I was young and

58
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:29,010
I've been saying in my whole life,
but what does help mean is helping

59
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,670
anything in another language is help a
bad word and other languages.

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,560
So I'm looking up if the word help means
something in another language.

61
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:42,510
Not that there weren't help.
If the word help means something in

62
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:46,090
another language that
you're gonna have to award it.

63
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,960
You're gonna have to word it uniquely I
think because it's a.

64
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,280
that's a hard one.
That's a,

65
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,280
that's a,
that's yeah.

66
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,520
I don't even know anymore.
Now it's translation.

67
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,590
Something like that.
Maybe an Arabic or something.

68
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm not.
I that have any sort of alternate

69
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,790
meanings and other languages.
He,

70
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,370
I'm not accusing anybody the Arab
nations or whatever,

71
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,460
or a beach or whatever,
you know,

72
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,640
the Arabic and Hebrew,
like those old old languages have the

73
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:18,040
coolest letters.
Like the way they write things,

74
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,280
like you look at some old Hindu script
or something like that.

75
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:24,730
Like why is that looks so cool.
It seemed like a mystery man.

76
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:27,320
Anytime,
like even Russian when you see Russia

77
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,720
and written out and you're like,
whoa,

78
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,730
look at the crazy little letters they
have.

79
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,563
Like,
look at that.

80
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,850
Like this is like some alien writing.
Yeah,

81
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,410
I'd be furious.
I'm like,

82
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,080
I couldn't,
I couldn't imagine having to learn some

83
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,340
of the other languages.
You know,

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,550
like I'm going to China next week we
want to Shanghai and I'm like,

85
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,150
it's basically just gonna be looking
around at different drawings,

86
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,670
you know,
like as far as even though words go,

87
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,710
it's going to be.
I think they have a lot of stuff in

88
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,810
English there.
Oh yeah.

89
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,050
Yeah.
Are a lot.

90
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,000
A lot of countries where there's a lot
of tourism.

91
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,930
They just put stuff in English.
English seems to be the language that

92
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,560
most European countries,
like most people know you can,

93
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,450
you can kind of get by and in Italy you
can kind of get by in Germany,

94
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,720
just speak English.
It's a,

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,520
it's,
it's really interesting man,

96
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:17,260
because it's because I guess there's so
much tourism and I guess everyone's

97
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,090
worried about us because we have the
nuclear bombs.

98
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,570
Everybody learned English and we
traveled a lot because we have more

99
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,850
money here probably.
So we have the ability to go places

100
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,480
maybe.
Um,

101
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,580
do you like English?
That's the only language I know.

102
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,020
So yeah,
I like it,

103
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,920
but it's just weird how much cooler
other languages look when they're

104
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,930
written out.
I guess it's just because we're what

105
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:42,931
we're accustomed to,
but like tie at writing or like I was

106
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,830
sweating.
I tried to read something one time and

107
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,610
tie.
I was sweating by the end of the

108
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,740
craziest.
I mean ic food.

109
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,541
Yeah.
Like it just,

110
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,900
like,
it took me out of my element,

111
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:53,830
man.
There was a couple of,

112
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,600
uh,
a couple of words off,

113
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:56,340
uh,
you know,

114
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,340
I almost needed help Asian characters
look like if you had a movie like a

115
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:05,560
science fiction movie and in the movie
they found a crashed Ufo and it had some

116
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:07,930
writing on the I beams or something like
that.

117
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,120
It would look like a lot of Asian
writing.

118
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,830
Right.
It would look like something,

119
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,880
something crazy from Asia that like,
you're like,

120
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,810
what am I looking at?
Right.

121
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,030
Like alien issue.
You're saying I might as well be alien

122
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,680
writing if you don't know it.
Yeah.

123
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,500
If there were alien writing,
you think it's going to look more like

124
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,770
something from Asian writing than it is
from American writing.

125
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,520
Well,
it'd be weird if it was like comic book

126
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,660
font.
Yeah,

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,260
like a or whatever.
It's like,

128
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,880
wait a minute.
Alien speak English.

129
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,690
Yeah,
Bro.

130
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,540
Everybody does.
What if aliens were in like a Boeing

131
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,680
shuttle man?
That's the biggest mind fuck that I ever

132
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:49,681
heard was that because of the size of
infinity [inaudible] not only is there

133
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,360
another theo vaughn out there in the
world,

134
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,470
but because infinity is so big,
I'm going to butcher for short.

135
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,600
We talked about this a little bit less.

136
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,331
I was in.
He did.

137
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:03,940
We did a little thing you've ever done.
Someone has done the exact same things,

138
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,450
the exact same order down to the last
millisecond.

139
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,250
Do you believe?
Do you.

140
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,100
Okay.
So that's something that you think are,

141
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,140
that's something that you think that
could be really true.

142
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,420
I think it could be really true.
Um,

143
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:21,980
but honestly my brain is not really
strong enough to compute that,

144
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,080
so I would have to take many,
many,

145
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:28,220
many hours to really thinking about what
that means because right now when I'm

146
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,480
saying what I'm saying,
I'm like,

147
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,510
it's one of those whoa dude.
Things like I'm saying it,

148
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,280
but I'm not really thinking it through.
Yeah.

149
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,193
I.
How much,

150
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,100
how much are you really thinking
through?

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,230
Yeah,
just a couple of steps.

152
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,610
You're not really thinking.
Okay.

153
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:42,710
That there's a.
So then that means for you,

154
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,440
there's another,
there's another man out there who did

155
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,690
comedy it last night at the comedy store
who wore,

156
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,870
did the exact same set,
tripped over the exact same words,

157
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,820
spelt his water the same way every.

158
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,490
It's supposed to be everything and not.
Not only that,

159
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,340
but because infinity so big.
They're supposed to be an infinite

160
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:00,470
number of those people out there.
Yeah.

161
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:03,020
I don't want that.
I don't man,

162
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:04,460
because that would hurt my feelings.
Honestly.

163
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:08,330
It would make me feel.
I think it makes accept.

164
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,500
I think it makes sense.
I think the universe is so big,

165
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,490
right?
I mean,

166
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,770
everything's so big.
Just what we know about our solar system

167
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,530
so big.
It's so big.

168
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,300
That alone,
it's crazy.

169
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,550
The idea that there's no end to the
crazy.

170
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,541
We're like,
Nah,

171
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,870
Nah,
it's gotta be an end.

172
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,030
No,
no,

173
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,020
no,
no,

174
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,860
no,
no.

175
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,590
That's too crazy.
Like what's too crazy when it comes to

176
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:33,260
the universe,
the universe is crazy.

177
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,190
There is nothing about it that makes any
sense.

178
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,650
It's so crazy that we don't like to
think about it.

179
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:44,651
Last night I was watching the fireworks
and the fireworks were going off and I

180
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:45,411
was thinking,
yeah,

181
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,100
this is Kinda cool.

182
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,370
You know what's cooler?
The fucking billions of flying

183
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:54,371
explosions that are above our heads,
the fireworks that are constantly in the

184
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,050
sky.
It's like we just,

185
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,730
we'll get together for like some
something made in Honduras,

186
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,930
but the fact that they're like shooting
stars every night and nobody gives a

187
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:04,560
fuck.
Yeah.

188
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,900
And we like because the streetlights,
we don't see the craziest light show

189
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,520
ever,
which is the Milky Way.

190
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,450
Yeah.
You know,

191
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,610
when you draw,
make that drive out to vegas or you

192
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,270
know,
into driving through Montana at night or

193
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:18,650
something like that.
You pull over.

194
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,360
What does that.
Is that fireworks from last night by

195
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,220
last night?
Just from a,

196
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,170
the NBC for helicopter Pasedena to
downtown.

197
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,820
That's awesome.
Those are illegal.

198
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,240
At least half of them are illegal.
Right.

199
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,780
I would say most of them are illegal.
It looks like a lot of like a kind of

200
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,470
civil war artwork also sped up dude for
a firefighter,

201
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:42,950
that has got to be a crazy time,
but some of them get off.

202
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,410
I think on fires,
like some of them,

203
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,640
I think they want a little bit of fire.
You don't think?

204
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,020
Yes.
Well,

205
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:52,550
it's been proven that some people that
are mentally ill that become firemen and

206
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,530
actually start fires something,
you know,

207
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,410
it's not,
it's not 99 point nine,

208
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,730
nine,
nine percent of them or whatever the

209
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,950
number is,
but occasionally in every line of work,

210
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,210
you know,
you get someone who's crazy.

211
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,190
Yeah.
And I could see that dude,

212
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:08,160
you want something gone and you don't
have a lot of money or anything like

213
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,720
that.
I think of that.

214
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,620
It's also just that they're crazy.
Yeah.

215
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,440
You know,
they're just.

216
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,650
Some people there's something wrong,
right.

217
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,520
There's,
there's connections that are being made

218
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:19,350
in there and then not they,
they,

219
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,380
they're capable of doing things just to
deceive.

220
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:28,770
People would rip people off or they're
capable of doing things for their own

221
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,200
personal gain,
like lighting a building on fire just so

222
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,190
they could put it out.

223
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,410
Like there's some people that are just
broken,

224
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,500
like there's something about them that's
just not connected.

225
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,311
Right?
Yeah.

226
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,300
We should shut them down,
man.

227
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,370
I think.
I think in the future we have to have

228
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:45,330
some better programs to find out who's
just not even who doesn't care about

229
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,080
people.
Yeah,

230
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
yeah.
There's people that don't care about

231
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:51,330
people who doesn't care about people
because if you don't care about people

232
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:54,600
then it's just not.
Then you shouldn't be here.

233
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,190
He should be somewhere else.
You should be in a place where they

234
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:57,390
don't have any people,
you know?

235
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,460
Yeah.
It's just a dangerous thing to have

236
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,810
around.
For the most part.

237
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,740
It's fine.
Right?

238
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:05,660
Because life is fairly easy and
civilized times.

239
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:07,620
Right?
Most of this stuff is fun.

240
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,750
Most of the stuff without,
you know,

241
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,970
the caveat for the occasional chaos,
but it's just fucking.

242
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,890
It's hard to tell how crazy people are
until something really happens and me

243
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,960
and you really need to count on them and
when they,

244
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:23,280
you know,
when you're pinned underneath the

245
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:26,220
dresser and they look at you and they
just run out of the room and just take

246
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:26,581
off,
you know,

247
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:27,750
like,
you're not even going to help me.

248
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,280
Wow.
There's people like that.

249
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,190
Do you think some of those people didn't
even know that they would?

250
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:36,060
Do that until the situation arises that
that's sometimes what I would love to

251
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:38,640
have some and I know this sounds a
little dark but like to have some

252
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:42,600
serious stressors in our world to find
out even who I really am,

253
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,930
you know,
like to see who rises to like who you

254
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:49,260
are inside,
like what rises to the core of my skin

255
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:51,240
and says this is who I am.
You know,

256
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,270
like I got trapped in an elevator,
wants to do with like seven or eight

257
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:54,841
people.
Okay.

258
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,470
And this sounds like a small idea,
but this was like three hours,

259
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,650
right.
And suddenly like at first one dude's

260
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,640
kind of verbose.
He's suddenly like I'm the leader,

261
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,000
but like an hour later he's like trying
to fuck a couple chicks that are also

262
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:08,130
stuck in the elevator and you start to
see like,

263
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:10,080
okay wait,
when he was trying to fuck them,

264
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,260
like it was hitting on them or he's
trying to actually get down in the

265
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:13,710
elevator.

266
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,770
No,
he wasn't kind to fucking other,

267
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,060
but he was maybe going to fuck them
later if they got out of the elevator a

268
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:20,020
safely,
not like a rape or like a guy who's

269
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,580
going gonna date them or take them to
dinner and then hopefully have sex with

270
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:25,770
them at some point if they want to as
well.

271
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,590
But he um,
but you know what I'm saying?

272
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,720
So yeah,
consensual sex.

273
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,290
Yeah,
yeah,

274
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,850
there you go.
But he,

275
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,060
but you started to see who was who,
like one guy was like,

276
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:39,480
just literally wouldn't listen.
Anyone tried to rip the doors open for

277
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:44,370
two hours and then like just like,
just like gave up on that one lady was

278
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,680
really scared.
Like immediately it started to kind of

279
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,900
fold out who was going to be who,
you know,

280
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,870
I wouldn't know what to do.
I don't know if I don't think you're

281
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:54,070
supposed to climb out though.
That seems like

282
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,300
death,
right?

283
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,900
Climb out into that shaft.
You're supposed to stay here as far as I

284
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,280
know you're supposed to stay.
I mean,

285
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,960
they must have some sort of regular,
but you know,

286
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:07,961
have an elevator fell in one of the UFC
hotels like real far and fucked up CB

287
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:12,820
dollar away.
One of the UFC fighters.

288
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:15,130
His back is fucked up from that.
Apparently.

289
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:19,150
Apparently he's suing.
I don't think he fought that day.

290
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:23,950
I think they had to cancel his fight.
I think I might be wrong about that,

291
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,170
but I know his back was like
significantly fucked up from that fall.

292
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,850
Elevators make it too easy,
man.

293
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,090
I miss the old days sometimes when you
do this for the fight.

294
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,310
He scratched from the fight.
Yeah.

295
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:39,490
And he's fought since,
but I think he's still having problems

296
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,430
with his back.
Yeah.

297
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,251
And yeah,
it's hard to fix,

298
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:45,160
to have back to one of the hardest.

299
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,500
One of the hardest things to make better
again.

300
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,510
It seems like every time people get
surgery,

301
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,170
it's just a slippery slope.
It's very rare that someone gets surgery

302
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,250
on their back and they go,
oh,

303
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,110
my back's great now.
Everything's fine.

304
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,251
It's always like,
yeah,

305
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,800
I got to go in again.
I got another disk.

306
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,010
You're like,
oh no.

307
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,240
And they're literally getting their back
fused from top to bottom.

308
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,750
No dudes with like four or five fake
disks in their back that are still

309
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,760
fighters to Yo know.
Hey,

310
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,970
tito has several fused in his neck.
He has artificial spacers from where the

311
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,920
discs used to be.
He has that in his back,

312
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,330
his multiple operations on his back.
Do you think that that like,

313
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,610
because some people think like you know,
a lot of your ci and you're like line up

314
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:29,060
as in,
you know,

315
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,893
like you're.

316
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,990
Do you think that that catchall tourney
of it?

317
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,300
Yeah.
I don't know.

318
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,070
I don't know if that's real.
I don't know.

319
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,180
What is that?
Is it,

320
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,740
is it the actual disk gelatin or as the
spine itself?

321
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,450
The spinal column.
We're all the.

322
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,500
All the nerves are firing all the way up
to the brainstem.

323
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,950
Yeah.
It's really fucking crazy thing to risk.

324
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,050
If you think about that,
like the connection between your brain

325
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,730
and then that cord that goes to all your
body and everything moving and it's all

326
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:04,990
just this back area that very few people
ever even exercise,

327
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,370
which is so crazy.
Everybody's doing all this shit to get

328
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:14,020
your biceps looking fly and pump your
tits up and very few people are

329
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,340
concentrating on like lower back
exercises.

330
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,930
Reverse hypers,
protecting your spine,

331
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,020
putting muscle all around that bitch.
Work that core.

332
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,570
Do like kettle bell windmills.
You ever do?

333
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:29,080
Kettlebell windmills do?
Oh Shit,

334
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,260
they're so good.
Kettlebell windmills,

335
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,950
you.
You press the kettle button.

336
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:36,460
You go down and touch your touch the
ground by your foot and then

337
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:39,880
straightened back up again.
It's just amazing for your spine,

338
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:44,110
like all the muscles around your back
that stabilize everything and your

339
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:48,100
obliques and your abs and all your core.
It's a great exercise.

340
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,870
I've got to do more like adult fitness,
man.

341
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:51,200
I got to Gel a little bit.
You're.

342
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,100
That's what it looks

343
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,000
like.
Damn.

344
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,470
Look at all that shit.
That's the human spine.

345
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,330
Yup.
That's the nervous system.

346
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:59,490
That's the nervous feel like I'm an eat
this in China next week.

347
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:02,600
Dude.
In a weird way you can have dick over

348
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,580
there.
Somebody said they can.

349
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,390
You're gonna have human.
A human.

350
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,130
Indeck of mine said that,
and he's eating a lot of how he's eating

351
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:11,720
everywhere.
Is He Andrew Zimmerman,

352
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,320
honored foods guy now the podcast?
Yeah.

353
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:17,180
He's a chef.
He travels all over the world.

354
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,014
Really?
Cool guy.

355
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,720
Welcome this.
That picture is fucking bizarre,

356
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,100
man.
To think that that's all the stuff

357
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:24,290
that's firing your nerves.
That's crazy.

358
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,940
And what does that.
What does that even look like?

359
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,800
It almost looks like a jelly fish or
like a.

360
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,020
It looks like it's reaching for
something doesn't.

361
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,900
Yeah.
Shooting off into the cosmos son thing

362
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,920
at the top is making nuclear bombs at
the top is making four g cell phones and

363
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,230
40 megapixel front facing cameras.

364
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,070
It's Megan.
That thing is megan time machines.

365
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,390
That fucking thing is making satellite
transmission of video signals and

366
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:54,770
simultaneously delivered to televisions
worldwide.

367
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,390
That's what that thing is making,
dude.

368
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,420
You're things making Tesla's robberies,
pigs making pistols and steroids.

369
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,030
That things make it oxycotton that
fucking things make it everything.

370
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,020
That's what's fucked up about the human
breast.

371
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,770
Scary is that when you think about that
things making whiskey,

372
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,800
that things were making crack crystal
meth or crank

373
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,640
things,
making nail Polish and fake tits,

374
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,410
that thing is off the chain.
If you look at,

375
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,370
if you looked at the human brain for
like all this shit that is responsible

376
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:28,941
for you,
Blake,

377
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:30,980
what?
That area.

378
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,430
Oh my God,
and it looks like something you would

379
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:37,070
think maybe wouldn't even do nothing to.
You walk by that on the street and you

380
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:37,970
didn't know it was a brain.

381
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,020
You'd be like,
oh man.

382
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,060
She asked.
One of my favorite out here.

383
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,270
You was kind of a game is Mars attacks
where they have.

384
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:48,050
They're exposed brain.
Remember that you don't remember Mars

385
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:49,770
attacks.
I never seen anything like that.

386
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,050
Never saw Mars attacks.
I don't watch all of

387
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,700
this is one of the greatest movies of
all time.

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,020
It's Tim Burton,
right?

389
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,270
Is that who I believe it's because I'll
watch something amazing.

390
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,470
It's so good.
Dude.

391
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,730
Jack Nicholson is in it and he pleased,
pleased to obviously different people

392
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,520
really,
but it's obviously the same guy playing

393
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:14,090
to people and it's never brought up so
it's a great movie man.

394
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,430
I mean it is a great,
great movie.

395
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,780
Oh,
it looks bad dude.

396
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:19,180
It's so good.
Is it really?

397
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,410
It seems like it looks bad because
you're watching here,

398
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:23,900
but it's all on purpose.
It's on purpose.

399
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,570
It's like when the,
when this is what it is,

400
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:31,571
is they somehow or another captured how
we feel about this time period.

401
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,080
They captured it with this weird like
Vegas thing with this is the president

402
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:42,920
back then and when these aliens come off
this spaceship,

403
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,750
it's,
there's something about the way they

404
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:48,290
moved to makes you think like you're
watching a movie from the fifties but

405
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,430
still good,
like just

406
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,300
good enough.
But what he did by making the effects

407
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:59,301
weird and barely real is he almost gave
you in this stallion for like 19

408
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,520
sixties,
19 seventies movie.

409
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:04,950
You can see that a little bit right
here.

410
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,401
Yeah.
But.

411
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,100
But it's better.
It's way better than anything they were

412
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,120
capable of.
I mean,

413
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,730
look at the fucking,
the shadows and the head and everything

414
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:13,830
like that.
Watched a little bit of this real quick.

415
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,500
This is when they first land

416
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,600
come
in.

417
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,620
Yeah.

418
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,840
Oh,
that's cool.

419
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,220
Do you think you'd eat something from
Mars?

420
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:41,760
If they had,
like,

421
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,340
if they had to say this because I knew
you'd like to be a wild eater.

422
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:46,770
I've seen some of the stuff you eat.
You eat kind of rare.

423
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,610
You know,
you,

424
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,500
you,
you know you're not,

425
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,570
you're not afraid to eat the rayer.
And would you have,

426
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,560
um,
say this,

427
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:55,220
they catch a,
a Mars donkey or something,

428
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,200
you know,
and they just,

429
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,920
they're serving up.
You don't even know what's in it.

430
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,050
Bright Eyes Wide Shut party serving up a
donkey from Mars,

431
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,030
right?
How many pounds of that?

432
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:07,950
But you can add the.
I would need it.

433
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,990
No chance.
First of all,

434
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:10,801
people were.
First of all,

435
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,240
people are going to be definitely mad at
you.

436
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,000
You think people are mad at you for
eating animals on earth.

437
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,450
Imagine eating animals from space.
Only one.

438
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't be so fucking mad at you.
Second of all,

439
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,910
I would want,
I would not want to be an early adopter

440
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:26,670
of Mars meet.
Really don't want to sit back.

441
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,420
Look this,
people that are convinced that meat,

442
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,910
I don't agree with them,
but there's people that are convinced

443
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:36,270
that meat is bad for you.
That meat itself is bad for you.

444
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,280
Yeah,
because a lot of people that eat meat

445
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:42,120
wind up with a bunch of heart disease.
The problem is that they're not really

446
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:45,750
measuring just the meat.
They're just measuring people that eat

447
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,800
meat.
What else do you eat?

448
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,410
You eat a lot of sugar.
You have a lot of bread,

449
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:52,490
you have a lot of pasta.
You eat a lot of this and you drain

450
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,390
Tony's.
Yeah,

451
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,770
you might have.
You might smoke cigarettes,

452
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,080
so it's hard to tell and I think
different things are good for different

453
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:03,900
people,
but people can't even agree on whether

454
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:06,300
or not it's healthy to eat meat.

455
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,070
There's some people that disagree in it,
right?

456
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,610
What's.
Wouldn't you want to wait to see what

457
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,350
Mars meet to people?
Wouldn't you want to fucking I,

458
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,620
I'd want to sit back and be like,
dude,

459
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:19,830
I'm good with Bison.
You can eat those Mars donkeys all day

460
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:22,690
long.
I'm going to see what a 20 year profiled

461
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,620
fucking donkeys from Mars eaters looks
like.

462
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,470
A little bit of star dust steak or
something at a Mars.

463
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,680
They only have one,
but I'm saying that one donkey.

464
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,830
Yeah,
but it could be like some preannounce

465
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,030
getting your system and you got mad cow
disease like blindly.

466
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,340
You could also.
What if you adopt a superpower by eating

467
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,690
it?
That's true.

468
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,720
That's one thing that nobody ever brings
up with nuclear energy,

469
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,960
like all this,
all these nuclear disasters,

470
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,400
everybody's terrified of mutations

471
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,820
and radioactive waves and all this
shit's going to fuck us up,

472
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:56,200
but nobody remembers comic books where
every single time somebody got hit with

473
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,780
some radioactive shit,
they became a superhero superhero.

474
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,560
That's never happened here.
I wonder if I could handle the dude if I

475
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,800
had a super.
I just feel like I would tell everyone

476
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,900
it wouldn't be able to keep it a secret.
Some secrets powers.

477
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:11,020
You're allowed to just tell everybody.
Some dudes,

478
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,220
they just tell everybody,
right?

479
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,070
Like who?
Who doesn't have to keep it a secret.

480
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,520
Obviously the thing he can't keep it a
secret.

481
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,290
What is it that the big x men,
they had to go?

482
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,400
Yeah,
but they had high,

483
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,950
but the thing doesn't hide.
The thing is just,

484
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,920
that's what he's covered in rocks,
you know?

485
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,710
Say.
Yeah.

486
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,690
Oh yeah.
But the big fists.

487
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,850
Yeah.
Giant club time.

488
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,670
Who else doesn't have to hide anything?
You can hide anything.

489
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,660
Bruce Bannister,
who,

490
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,210
who's,
who is personable banner.

491
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,570
Bruce Banner.
Bruce Banner.

492
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,970
Do you know when they show as a
carpenter?

493
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,940
Isn't he?
No.

494
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,773
No.

495
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,970
Do you know that when they did the
incredible health TV show,

496
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,480
they changed his name from Bruce to
David because people thought Bruce was

497
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:55,360
gay.
Really was a lot of bruises.

498
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:58,840
Ged then do.
That's always been the stereotypical

499
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,700
name.
Oh wait,

500
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,380
when like a comedian would do a hack
joke about a gay guy,

501
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:05,610
they'd be like,
birth me randy over.

502
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,800
And really I would never heard Randy,
but bruce,

503
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,920
it's always been bruce is the name that
they would use.

504
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,360
So apparently people in the seventies
when the hulk TV show was around with

505
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,530
Lou Ferrigno.
Oh yeah,

506
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,330
yeah.
They just decided like,

507
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,350
Hey,
let's,

508
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:22,450
uh,
let's change this name,

509
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,570
change it,
make it David David Banner and we all

510
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,940
comic book Dorks like me.
We're like,

511
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:30,670
what?
How dare you,

512
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,120
how dare you change his name?
That was the best show ever because it

513
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,930
made it feel like a,
it may.

514
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,080
If,
if you were ugly,

515
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,570
you can still be cool and do neat stuff.
I felt like,

516
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,500
well it was the revenge of people who
are bullied and picked on.

517
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,850
There's the idea that you could be this
nerdy guy and you get picked on by these

518
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:51,640
assholes and you just fucking hulk out
become bulletproof.

519
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,250
Yeah.
I met him at the post office one time.

520
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,113
The frig.
No,

521
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,710
I met him.
He's a real nice guy.

522
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,641
Yeah.
He seemed nice.

523
00:22:57,641 --> 00:23:00,040
He was with a lady friend and it might
have been his wife a thing.

524
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,910
He's still yoked as fuck.
He's jacked like,

525
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,120
you know,
um,

526
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,870
he looks really good.
Like you looks healthy too.

527
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,370
It's crazy.
I mean,

528
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:11,230
the dude's got to be deep into his
sixties,

529
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,590
but he looks very healthy.
He might wonder who,

530
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,341
who,
who.

531
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:17,410
Um,
I wonder if people are going to start

532
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:19,010
living for like a really like looking at
them there.

533
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,480
That dude looks healthy as fuck and now
they are.

534
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,390
He looks a little bit more,
more reasonable.

535
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,463
Yeah.
I mean,

536
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,590
look,
he was a gigantic supersized human at

537
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,980
one point in time.
That's what he used to look like.

538
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,810
What the fuck is that?
So big.

539
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,230
So when you saw him on the hulk,
the problem was he couldn't really be

540
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:46,040
that defined for long periods of time
and film a show because it

541
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,060
was too unhealthy.
Oh,

542
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:51,770
it's super unhealthy when those guys are
like right about to pose down when

543
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:53,810
they're about to.
They're on death's door.

544
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,320
They are really unhealthy.
They get lightheaded.

545
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,830
Look at that dude.
Oldest fuck.

546
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:01,220
Who is that old and jacked?
That Willie Nelson.

547
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:04,870
That looks like a 75 year old jack man.
See them.

548
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,460
They have those,
that row say that guy gets shot and

549
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,210
killed.
Dude.

550
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,970
Depends how far I am from civilization.
Okay.

551
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:13,320
Let's say you're far man.
Eat them.

552
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,660
Yeah,
I'd eat them if it was,

553
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,300
whether or not eating them or not
surviving,

554
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,520
getting home to my family or something
like that.

555
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,650
Say this,
then I'm going to put you under a little

556
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:22,270
bit of,
um,

557
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,230
uh,
some,

558
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,051
uh,
if you don't mind.

559
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:24,810
Is that okay?
Do it.

560
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,643
Please do.
Okay.

561
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,380
So a ship went down a shuttle and air
ship or something,

562
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,243
a plane.

563
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,950
And you know,
like that movie alive,

564
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:31,850
right?
You're out there.

565
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,770
Do you?
Are you the chef?

566
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,260
You know you're going to eat it.
You know you're going to eat well.

567
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,490
It's whether or not the bodies like the
people are killed already.

568
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,250
The real problem is when people start
killing people and meeting people,

569
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,140
then you've got a real problem.
Okay?

570
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,910
People are already killed.
People are already dead.

571
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,650
It's to senior citizens.
That's it.

572
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,420
It was a small plane.
Well,

573
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,900
you got to decide.
People can live without food for several

574
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,730
weeks,
especially if you're the average

575
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:57,320
American.
You've got a lot of fat in your body.

576
00:24:57,321 --> 00:25:02,060
After a day or so,
your body kicks into fat burning ketosis

577
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:03,580
mode,
but you're going to be hungry though.

578
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,930
You're going to be hungry,
but you will be less hungry believe it

579
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:07,370
or not.
After the first day,

580
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,970
once your body kicks into fat burning,
like have you ever been on a fat burning

581
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:11,750
diet?

582
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,780
I've just on Paleo for a month.
It's a little different because Paleo,

583
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,430
you're still eating a lot of
carbohydrates.

584
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,560
Just cutting out all the grains and
things like that.

585
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,550
When you go on a fat burning diet,
one of the first things that happens is

586
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:25,490
your appetite just changes radically.
It's really weird.

587
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,710
Like you just stopped being hungry the
same way,

588
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,100
like hunger isn't a desperation thing.
Like when I know when I'm not ketogenic

589
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,710
because then my hunger gets desperate,
like I have to eat something.

590
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,873
Like I feel like,
Ooh,

591
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,700
I never feel like that.
With Quito it's like I'm hungry,

592
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,740
but I'm,
I'm okay.

593
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,610
It's like and through the day,
like energy levels are much more

594
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,740
stabilized.
That's what I felt like on Paleo.

595
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,030
I'd never done anything like that.
I mean,

596
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:52,190
I lost like 11 pounds was telling them
think I was supposed to lose,

597
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:53,840
like I didn't really have like a plan or
anything,

598
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,140
but next thing you know,
like I felt,

599
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,490
I never felt like I had to eat.

600
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,580
I felt like I needed to eat to get to
the next few moments in my life,

601
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:03,530
but I didn't feel like,
okay,

602
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:06,890
I got to make a big deal about eating.
It felt more like a survival technique,

603
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,620
like eating all day and then my mind,
I felt I did feel more energy.

604
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,130
I never felt like that after eating I
always felt like,

605
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:17,660
okay,
I can eat and then still go do

606
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,870
something.
I could go play cards or run around or

607
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,670
you know,
chase a friend or do anything,

608
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,533
you know,
hang out.

609
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,500
Yeah.
The um,

610
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,010
so who do you think you would have to?
You have to first of all,

611
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,770
talk to everybody about because you got,
like I said,

612
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:35,150
you got two weeks,
right?

613
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:37,340
You got two weeks for your body can just
go on fat.

614
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,560
So you're going to start using itself.
It,

615
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,360
that your body starts eating itself.

616
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,380
Okay.
You got to talk to people and say,

617
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:45,780
listen,
this person is dead,

618
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,110
okay,
this is just meat now that can keep us

619
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:54,111
alive and we can survive and we could
see our family and our friends or we

620
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,160
cannot eat this person and would take a
chance on going hungry and we might get

621
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:04,350
too weak to get outta here.
Like you have to think like,

622
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,150
what if,
what if you can get saved,

623
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,820
but you have to be able to hike out 30
miles in the mountains.

624
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,320
Okay,
so now you really planning ahead.

625
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,630
Then a lot of you have to.
You have to you you're,

626
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,090
you're either going to die or you're
going to live.

627
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,650
Okay.
These are the only two things that could

628
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:19,080
possibly happen.
The Internet even mattered at this

629
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:20,190
point,
so you've got to figure out,

630
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,110
is it even possible that you can live?

631
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,290
Is it possible you might be?
Might not be.

632
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,550
You might be in the mountains in the
winter with nothing around you to eat,

633
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,910
no way for you to get off the mountain
because it's too dangerous because you

634
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:36,420
get cliffed out every time he tried to
go down and then try to get back up and

635
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,720
you can't get back up and you're stuck.
You could fall and die.

636
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,900
It happens to people all the time,
so it might not be that you can make it,

637
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,390
but if you are going to make it out,
you're going to want to have some energy

638
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,560
and so different people have different
fitness levels obviously,

639
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:55,860
so some people like they're not even
going to be capable of hiking out.

640
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,000
Would it be take a lunch.
I mean,

641
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,380
you don't have to eat the whole person.
Right?

642
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:02,640
Then like you guys could.
You would eat them in parts for sure.

643
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,430
What would you have?
It's a psychologically devastating.

644
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,750
The thought of just eating human meat.
It's psychologically devastating.

645
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:12,640
You.
You're crossing a threshold that you

646
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:13,950
know you're in,
you're into.

647
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,570
It's a dark art.
To me,

648
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,010
it's everything.
It's everything.

649
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:21,330
It's sad.
It's crazy and it's also a rich part of,

650
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,880
you know,
human adventure history.

651
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:25,620
There was always like,
you run into cannibals,

652
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,110
you know,
it was like a pig part of those crazy

653
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:30,960
movies about it in the jungle.
They got eaten by cannibals.

654
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,820
Even Brady Bunch.
Remember they came across some people,

655
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:34,790
I think they were cannibals weren't
cannibal,

656
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,290
but like all,
even cartoons,

657
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,140
all of them did.
It was cannibals or like a joe versus

658
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:41,340
the volcano.
Remember that.

659
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,550
And I don't remember that.
I think he came across cannonballs well

660
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:48,090
there was saying Hannibal's in history.
A lot of cannibals.

661
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,270
I didn't know that there was so much
cannibalism amongst native Americans.

662
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,480
Native Americans would cannibalize
settlers.

663
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,060
They would.
Some of them like the Nez perce Indians.

664
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,350
Steve knows telling me about that.
They would cut dudes up and eat them.

665
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,930
Like,
Whoa,

666
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,400
that's,
that's crazy.

667
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:06,150
Imagine.
Yeah.

668
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,790
If somebody goes down and you're this
and there's a part you already know,

669
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:09,630
you like it.
Like,

670
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:12,750
I'm cutting this dude's sand.
I'm having a little bit of fucking

671
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,720
ligament right here on this hillside.
Rough man.

672
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,080
The guy got killed by a polar bear
yesterday in front of his kids in

673
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,520
Canada.
He was protecting his kids from the

674
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:26,380
polar bear
and uh,

675
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,980
he died 31 year old dude.

676
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,430
You know what,
that's a hero though.

677
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:33,840
I mean,
these kids will think of him as a hero.

678
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:38,130
A bet he lives in that same place where
those people live on that life below

679
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:40,140
zero.
I think it's called nunavet

680
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,380
people's lives.
He lives.

681
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:47,350
Uh,
I mean he lives in a really,

682
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:52,351
really remote area that has polar bears.
Polar bears are the most dangerous bear

683
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:56,740
you could ever run into because they are
the only animal that all,

684
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,670
all of them actively hunt people.
Really?

685
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,560
Nunavut.
That's the place where it was.

686
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,220
Yeah.
They,

687
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,710
they hunt everything.
Everything that moves.

688
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,660
They don't.
They don't have any vegetables up there.

689
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:10,390
So the,
they're the only 100 percent carnivorous

690
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,680
bear.
All they eat is meat.

691
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,000
All Day is meet.
Every other.

692
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:16,330
Bear is like eating berries and berries
or ignore you.

693
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,990
If they've got a whole field for a
barrier.

694
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,430
I not chase you asshole to your bones
and all that bullshit.

695
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,750
I'm just gonna eat beverage,
Lazy Vas.

696
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,600
I did some various laying on his back.
They love berries and you find like

697
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:32,380
giant fields of blueberries.
You'll find bears just snacking away,

698
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,140
having a great time eating blueberries.
They'll do it all day.

699
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,230
Not Polar bears.
Polar bears eat your asshole.

700
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,690
I'll kill you.
They kill everything,

701
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:42,760
man.
I would hate that.

702
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,350
I would.
If someone was trying to eat me,

703
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,910
man,
I would just be so upset.

704
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:46,744
I think.
Yeah.

705
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,500
Did you see that lady that got in
trouble because she shot a giraffe?

706
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,810
She shot him that she shot a rare
giraffe and so everybody's freaking out

707
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:58,000
on her.
It seemed sad,

708
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:59,680
man.
That giraffe seemed like it probably

709
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,710
wasn't going to do to her.
It's not going to do anything to her for

710
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:04,330
sure.
It's a.

711
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,360
It is rare for an animal to get that
old.

712
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,500
It's 18 years old.

713
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,870
It's real dark.
You haven't had dark skin or something.

714
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,090
A little bit of the old males.
They get dark.

715
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,930
That's super cool.
One thing though that people need to

716
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:17,561
know.
See,

717
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:20,860
all these things are complicated.
They're not as simple as everybody wants

718
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:24,190
to think they are,
and this is one of the things that's

719
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:27,880
complicated about this store is that
that draft was killing little giraffes.

720
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,890
It's a normal thing.
The old bowls like that one,

721
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,220
which is a big,
massive 18 year old animal,

722
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,560
a huge,
huge animal.

723
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,650
Uh,
he just was not having it with these

724
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,810
young ones coming up,
not having it.

725
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,490
What do you think it is?
Jealousy or anger?

726
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:46,710
It's just nature.
You know,

727
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:48,610
they,
they kill off the younger males,

728
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,040
like pissed at the neighbor kids kind of
thing.

729
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,690
Don't.
They just don't want anybody taking

730
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,970
their spot.
They don't know that they're riding off

731
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:55,750
into the sunset.

732
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,760
Like he's not a viable breeding male
anymore,

733
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,180
but still huge.
So at 18 years of age,

734
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:04,960
he had killed off three young bowls.
So they were going to have to kill him.

735
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,010
Right.
Because it's not good.

736
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,650
You need the bulls to keep the thing
alive.

737
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,770
What was,
well,

738
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:12,430
not just that he.
This is a species of giraffe that

739
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,160
already has a population problem.
There's not a lot of them.

740
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,210
And if he's killing off these young
bowls,

741
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,330
each one of those young bulls could have
fathered countless children.

742
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,440
So they're missing all these future
children for one bull who can't even

743
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,630
breed anymore.
And he's going to continue to do it.

744
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,840
He was seeking out the young bulls.
Yeah.

745
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,930
Already killed three.
Like this is not a cut and dry thing.

746
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,770
I don't think it looks cool to pose with
a rifle and a giraffe.

747
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:39,980
And

748
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,900
I mean there's something about giraffes
that are so gentle that they let kids

749
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,580
feed them when you go to the fucking
zoo.

750
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,950
Right?
I don't.

751
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:53,020
So I get why people would be upset.
But when you find out what it actually

752
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:54,350
is,
you go,

753
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,460
oh,
this is not as,

754
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,600
this is more complicated than I'm.
Than I'm seeing on the surface.

755
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,110
It's not simply a cruel person shot a
giraffe and we should be angry at her.

756
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,040
It's like,
no,

757
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,550
they had to shoot that giraffe because
it was killing other giraffes.

758
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,150
So is it appropriate the way she
celebrated it?

759
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:12,580
That's when you have to wonder,
you know,

760
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,330
but they were eating it.
I mean,

761
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:17,270
that's the other thing.
It's like they got fucking 800 pounds of

762
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,250
meat or something like that out of that.
Wow.

763
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,400
That's a huge animal.
I think it was more than that.

764
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,140
Then they say 2000 pounds of meat.

765
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,980
I think it's a 4,000 pound animal and
they got 2000 pounds of meat,

766
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:31,270
which they give to all the villages.
All the people there and I know people

767
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,830
like,
wait,

768
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,500
I don't give a fuck.
You shouldn't shoot a draft.

769
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,360
I feel the same way because when I see a
giraffe I don't think of it as something

770
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,880
I want to shoot and eat.
I think of it as something a little kid

771
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:43,550
can feed at the fucking zoo because
they're so gentle.

772
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,310
They're so gentle that they like people
feed them.

773
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,080
Oh yeah.
They had a thing by our home when I was

774
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,670
growing up,
they had a thing dude at a couple of

775
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,860
giraffes out there,
a couple of lambs and shit.

776
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,280
You can get out there and buy a little
cup of corn and go out there and you

777
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:56,940
don't even have to know.
Like you don't have to sign away.

778
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,820
You don't have to do anything,
you don't even have to fucking be able

779
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:00,950
to read very well and you could fucking
feed a Giraffe,

780
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:04,070
you know,
point blank is the only animal that is a

781
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:09,071
wild African animal that we let kids
feed at the fucking zoo.

782
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:11,510
Little kids can feed them.
Yeah.

783
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,580
I can't believe that there's that much.
I mean,

784
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,710
when I hear that for one,
the lady,

785
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:17,870
what did she,
why did she have to put that picture

786
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:19,670
out?
What was in it for her to do that?

787
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,780
If she even knew like she's a hunter and
she was excited that you got to kill a

788
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,250
big giraffe,
you know,

789
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,810
and the,
you know,

790
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,270
it gets.
It's,

791
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,110
it gets strange when you just kill a
bunch of things and make stuff.

792
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,630
Trophies and you put them in your trophy
room and you go,

793
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:36,740
well I want to get it now.

794
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,240
I want to get a Ram.
Okay,

795
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,950
I got a ramp.
Now I want to get a mountain goat.

796
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:42,410
I'll get it.
And you got like this menagerie inside

797
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,650
of your house.
That's it gets dark man.

798
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,740
Now I want to get a mouse.
Now.

799
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:47,690
I want to get a stepdad now.
I want to get a fucking.

800
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,160
But then is like,
okay,

801
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:52,340
but if you're eating all of those things
and this is how you get your meat.

802
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,870
Yeah.
Is that okay?

803
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,261
Well,
yeah,

804
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:55,280
that's okay,
but there's something.

805
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,790
There's something.
We all have a strange feeling about

806
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,070
this.
The idea is that people are killing

807
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:04,850
these things and they're getting some
kind of pleasure out of it and then not

808
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:06,640
doing it just to eat it.
Right.

809
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,560
It's not like even if you you are going
to eat it,

810
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,140
we don't want you to be really happy
when you kill something.

811
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,820
That's too.
That's some of it.

812
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,610
I think the villagers should it be able
to.

813
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,740
Ones that should vote on if it was okay
or not.

814
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,770
It's in their village.
They would vote okay every time because

815
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:24,230
they get money from it.
Then to me then that seems okay because

816
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:26,750
a lot of times it's like we're judging
things from so far away.

817
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,450
We don't even know.
We didn't even know what it's like.

818
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:33,770
We're talking about completely different
dynamics in terms of like the way their

819
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:35,210
culture works.
First of all,

820
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,980
the money for these big hunt so that
these

821
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,410
people pay to shoot all these different
things down there.

822
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:45,030
That's a shitload of money and that shit
load of money for that area,

823
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:49,020
for that part of the world is gigantic
fuels conservation efforts.

824
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,650
It pays for these people that are
essentially their version of game

825
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,880
wardens,
you know,

826
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:57,060
um,
and then they have these different

827
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,820
people that are employed by these
hunting companies and then there's

828
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:04,850
resources to stop poaching and then
resources to actively participate in

829
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,000
controlling habitat and making sure
these animals are in healthy populations

830
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:15,030
and bringing their numbers up.
This is all done through the money that

831
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:16,740
comes from hunting them.
So it's super,

832
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,710
it's super fucked up.
Right.

833
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,750
It's,
it's weird because it doesn't make

834
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:25,080
sense.
It's like the people that are paying to

835
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:27,840
keep these animal alive are also the
ones that want to shoot up.

836
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,380
So people are like,
what the F we would like it to be.

837
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,950
All the conservation money comes from
people who just love animals and want to

838
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,960
keep them alive.
But that's not the case.

839
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,070
That's not the case.
No.

840
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,100
The money comes almost exclusively
because there are a lot of conservation

841
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:48,891
groups that do donate for wildlife
protection and for preserving of animal

842
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:49,830
habitats.
There are,

843
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,510
there's,
there's definitely some people that

844
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:52,380
donate,
right.

845
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,900
But there's no,
it's not even close to the amount of

846
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:58,680
money that's raised from hunting to and
especially hunting you on that local

847
00:36:58,681 --> 00:36:59,530
level.
Like you're a,

848
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,720
you know,
like some of these,

849
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,300
like these programs,
I'm sure there are a little bit more

850
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:04,530
bigger,
more blanket,

851
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:06,480
you know,
but you get into that local level.

852
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,700
$50,000 can keep,
you know,

853
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:13,500
a small town or small habitat around for
the year,

854
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,610
that money who was getting all that
money.

855
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:18,560
But you're right,
it's.

856
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,190
But it's,
it makes us uncomfortable.

857
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,600
But rightly so.
I mean,

858
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,420
you look at a Giraffe,
you want giraffes to stay alive.

859
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,620
You say like,
that's amazing,

860
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:30,150
but we have to know the facts behind it.
In this particular case where they,

861
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,330
that giraffe had to go,
that draft was killing giraffes.

862
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,910
You ever seen him fight?
It's the most familiar thing.

863
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:38,160
They just had buddy each other.
They swing their head like,

864
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,430
oh,
like a mace smash into each other.

865
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:44,700
It's what a terrible way to fight.
It's fucking crazy.

866
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,510
Suck at fighting Esophagus fucking.
It's like Krista.

867
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:50,410
It's almost like Chris delea.
Maybe if you were in height

868
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,720
and I'm just saying that a love.
Absolutely love you.

869
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:57,990
Love as a Sophos,
a very prominent target.

870
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,030
If you wanted to hit something,
have you seen this funny thing,

871
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,380
this Jaguar Challenge?
Instagram.

872
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,460
He's silly.
He's so surprised.

873
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:10,680
Very silly.
Sometimes you don't really like,

874
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,720
dude,
he is.

875
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,700
He's so funny and he's an a.
he's so fucking funny.

876
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,250
Very good dude.
And very funny.

877
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,480
Very silly.
He's just sick.

878
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,150
He's got his own kind of con.
His own kind of funny.

879
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,110
Yeah.
And he lives.

880
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:24,030
Yeah.
And he's so confident and living in that

881
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:24,511
space,
man.

882
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,640
It's kind of um,
uh,

883
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,360
yeah.
It's,

884
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,520
it's interesting.
It kind of gets to really get to know

885
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,170
that guy.
Well that's what you know,

886
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,600
it is with you too.
It's like your kind of,

887
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,290
you,
you do your kind of funny.

888
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,360
And that's a,
that's an interesting thing.

889
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:40,450
Like when someone finds their,
like we're talking about Mitch Hedberg

890
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,240
the other day,
like he had his kind of funny like you

891
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:45,520
could see you'd hear Mitch Hedberg joke
and you go,

892
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:46,120
oh,
that's a,

893
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,820
that's a Hedburg joke.
That's how he does his kind of funny.

894
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,703
Yeah.
Yeah.

895
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,770
It's so funny,
man.

896
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,020
Well thanks for saying that man.
Appreciate that.

897
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:54,370
Yeah,
I think it's like,

898
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:56,860
as I've gotten a little bit older,
it's made me feel more comfortable to

899
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:57,910
just be myself,
you know,

900
00:38:57,911 --> 00:39:01,610
for so long out here.
I'll just felt if I was just afraid to

901
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:02,610
be myself self esteem,
you know,

902
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:03,640
who I was,
you know,

903
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,930
it's all those things,
man,

904
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,120
you know,
it's hard trying to be trying to be

905
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:12,121
confident in what you're doing is a
confidence destroying a way to make a

906
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:13,600
living,
you know?

907
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,380
And I get intimidated.
I would get intimidated easy.

908
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,180
Like this is the first time I've
actually even felt kind of a little bit

909
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:20,860
more comfortable being in here.
Really?

910
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:21,760
Yeah.
In here?

911
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,920
Yeah.
Like I don't know if it's not you,

912
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,570
it's just something with me,
you know?

913
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,990
It's just something I don't know.
I don't know if it's like,

914
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,890
if I feel like if there's like men that
are more like kind of physically,

915
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,740
you know,
in shape or just sitting things maybe

916
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:39,450
inside of me somewhere that make me feel
I'm just on,

917
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,480
you know,
uh,

918
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,380
I don't know what it is.

919
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,450
It's what people worry about being
bullied.

920
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,710
For sure.
People develop like A.

921
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,460
I feel it sometimes I'm around people
really.

922
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,540
Oh No,
I was thinking about that.

923
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,200
You like hanging out around like real
rare hang out around some real rare

924
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,530
animal humans.
You know,

925
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,500
superhuman.
That Daniel Cormier.

926
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,660
Dude,
that's super human.

927
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,070
That big coffee.
Jon Jones who human.

928
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,360
Yeah.
Mighty mouse.

929
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,020
Amy's a small superhuman.
George St Pierre Superhuman.

930
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,150
Have you ever been in an elevator with
them or something and be like,

931
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:12,070
we're a bunch of those dudes.
Just fucking kill me.

932
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,480
Kill you.
Anytime they want.

933
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,530
You have to deal with that feeling.
It's not the best fit as crazy.

934
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,510
Well,
you're talking to Francis in Ghana.

935
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,840
That's always in your mind.
No matter what you guys are talking

936
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:24,970
about is a part of you that says if you
want to do,

937
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,760
he could just kill me like that.
Do you get scared with?

938
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,660
Sometimes.
Honestly,

939
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,500
like I get scared for you whenever you
have to go in the ring after the fights.

940
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,830
Do you ever get scared?
A little bit,

941
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,200
dude.
The first time I ever interviewed

942
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:40,270
anybody ever after a fight,
I had an interview Mark Coleman after he

943
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:45,271
choked out Dan several.
And this was in like UFC fucking 12.

944
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,670
So that was 1997.
And uh,

945
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,610
Mark Coleman was so fired up man because
he had just won the heavyweight title

946
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,960
fucking jacked.
He was so jacked and uh,

947
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:05,020
he was fucking pumped up and he had no
idea Bayer for that movie doesn't even,

948
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,410
he was the king of the world back then.
Mark the hammer,

949
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,410
coleman changed the fucking game.
Look at the.

950
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:14,380
Because she was like a real world class
wrestler,

951
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,600
taken dudes down and just smashing them
any was fucking huge,

952
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,730
huge,
you know.

953
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:26,650
And so I had to interview first
interview anybody and had no idea who I

954
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,670
was.
And it was like,

955
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:31,210
Oh fuck is this guy interviewing?
But I ask respectful questions and then

956
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,980
gave him an opportunity to express
himself and it

957
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,870
worked out.
But I prepared for that man.

958
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,180
I was nervous.
Wow.

959
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,380
Whew.
I was nervous.

960
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,790
That's interesting.
Yeah.

961
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,481
Because it's,
to me,

962
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:42,291
I'm like,
Holy Shit,

963
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,330
this guy,
you know,

964
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,430
this man is going into the cage after
lunch.

965
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:47,360
Yup.
Yup.

966
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,480
That's what he does.
How you.

967
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,750
That's it.
I felt like me.

968
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,250
But like when you go like,
you know,

969
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:53,050
I'm not,
uh,

970
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:53,630
you know,
these,

971
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,220
you know,
these guys are very,

972
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,500
some of these admin are very physically
imposing to me.

973
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:59,570
Like.
And so when you,

974
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,470
sometimes I'm like,
man,

975
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:03,100
I can't believe that you go in there.
It's just brave as well.

976
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,650
No one thing that I think they all know.
And if they don't know,

977
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:11,651
I want them to know that I don't want
anything other than them to shine.

978
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,530
That's all I'm trying to do.
Like when I interview people,

979
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:18,830
but I'm trying to do is give them an
opportunity to talk about moments.

980
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
I just want to give them a chance to
shine,

981
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,150
show who they are.
I want them to feel comfortable.

982
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,170
I look out for their best interests a
really do I try to do that with

983
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:29,150
commentary.
Even if it sounds critical,

984
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:34,520
my critical commentary is just expose.
Like I look at it in terms of I'm

985
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:38,540
looking at it like it's a math problem
or a system and if I see things I'm

986
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:39,191
like,
this is.

987
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:42,290
This is an issue.
Even if the person can win with this

988
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:43,820
issue,
this is a real issue.

989
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,700
Like a a high level person is gonna
exploit that issue.

990
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,470
Maybe this guy can't do it,
but this.

991
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,320
Sometimes people get upset at that.
That does happen,

992
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:51,861
but I say,
listen,

993
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:56,540
I have to bose.
It made me think I exaggerate,

994
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,730
but believe me,
those fucking high class killers that

995
00:42:59,731 --> 00:43:03,020
see the same shit that I see,
they're going to try to exaggerate that

996
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:04,970
shit too,
that you're going to try to jump on that

997
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:07,480
little hole.
There's a little hole somewhere and that

998
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,930
happens all the time with people that
get mad.

999
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,600
If you point out their holes,
it doesn't mean they can't win.

1000
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,820
There's guys who've gotten their entire
career,

1001
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:16,790
they rarely throw a kick.
They never submit anybody and there some

1002
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:21,140
of the best of all time that you don't
have to have a fully complete game.

1003
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Sometimes it's better to just be ultra
good at one or two things and those

1004
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:28,160
other things just don't fuck with
submissions,

1005
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,780
you know,
just don't fuck with me of uh,

1006
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,380
there's,
there's,

1007
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,720
there's people that are like that.
They take someone's back,

1008
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:35,240
they never choke them.
They just keep punching them.

1009
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,670
They never took anybody.
There's a lot of people like that.

1010
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:38,650
And then there's right

1011
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,360
coons on with raccoons.
Do that.

1012
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,910
Will get read a raccoon on.
You never had a raccoon on me.

1013
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,290
Have you?
Oh yeah,

1014
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:48,310
they bite you dude.
If you ever have one bite you a have.

1015
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:50,320
I have one.
I've had maybe buy it.

1016
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:52,360
I mean I got scratched or bitten.
I mean I had to get all the rabies

1017
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:52,871
shots.
I mean,

1018
00:43:52,871 --> 00:43:54,730
I grew up in like the rabies bill,
you know,

1019
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,010
so you'd,
you'd,

1020
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,510
uh,
and they group up raccoons.

1021
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,490
Do the raccoons are.
They are.

1022
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,380
I can't believe we can't shut all that
shit down.

1023
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,270
How many of them are roaming the streets
at night?

1024
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:05,180
A lot.
Pro.

1025
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,350
How crazy stare you down,
bro.

1026
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:10,610
You ever seen Madagascar and they're
fucking.

1027
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,400
They're everywhere.
Did I lived in.

1028
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,780
I lived in new Rochelle,
New York and uh,

1029
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,670
they used to have these urban raccoon.
Oh yeah.

1030
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,220
Different kinds of raccoon.

1031
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,560
Raccoons that live in high density areas
are bolder species and they have access

1032
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:29,470
to massive amounts of food.
They just would lift off the lid from

1033
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,040
the garbage.
Can they lift off lid to get

1034
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,990
inside the garbage?
Can they tear the garbage bags?

1035
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:35,730
All but.
And they'd just be sitting there staring

1036
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:38,850
at you to look.
And Jack looked at Gold's gym tank top

1037
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:40,920
on like they were big.
I was like,

1038
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:43,620
how is that a Raghu that's a big animal.
Yeah.

1039
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,880
So I bought a blow gun.
Shoot Darts.

1040
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,610
You did.
I did.

1041
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,920
These motherfuckers were wreck my
garbage and you're like,

1042
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:59,730
shit overnight be sleeping.
And I hear the Dang look at him climbing

1043
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:00,760
up.
Do we have one?

1044
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,450
And what is he doing?
He's going to get that bird feeder and

1045
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,150
unscrew the bird.
He's doing my God.

1046
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,540
Look how smart is.
Dude.

1047
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,080
This is insane.
Oh,

1048
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,270
smart.
This thing is.

1049
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,420
But also look how confident it is and
its strength.

1050
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,760
And look at him looking over the camera.
He knows he's being filmed.

1051
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,130
And look how he's,
you know,

1052
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,610
I don't think he knows that,
but look,

1053
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,060
look how,
how good he is at climbing up.

1054
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,470
I mean,
this is crazy.

1055
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:27,600
The amount of physical strength is,
fucker has.

1056
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,680
Look at this.
Look at that.

1057
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,960
Just let all that seed go and now was
hand partying like crazy and they fuck

1058
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:35,310
today.
You can hear them at night.

1059
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:36,410
We used to live,
uh,

1060
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,570
we used to hear a bunch of them having
sex at night and you could hear 'em.

1061
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,850
You can go outside and even in a
residential neighborhood,

1062
00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:46,730
dude,
there's 70 of them on your blog.

1063
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:50,010
Like there's so many raccoons living
amongst us that it's,

1064
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,560
it blows my mind that it's not a bigger
issue.

1065
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,680
Pull that up again.
Look with the video dude.

1066
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:58,680
How many people,
even if they could do that,

1067
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,650
if they had the kind of strength to do
that,

1068
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,490
how many people would even figure out
how to navigate that so easily to Matt

1069
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500
iseman would host this.
This is like American Ninja Warrior.

1070
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,220
Do you telling me that they don't steal
some of these games from this fucker?

1071
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,630
Look at him.
He stopped going full screen because

1072
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,960
when it goes full screen starts,
I don't know what the hell is happening.

1073
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,640
Look at this.
And he said,

1074
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:22,140
okay,
China person or something.

1075
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,400
Look at his fucking ability to just hang
on there with one arm and then grabbed

1076
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,920
with his feet.
That is bananas.

1077
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,080
What is that called?
An in UFC.

1078
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:32,350
Is that a move?
Uh,

1079
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,420
no.
It doesn't exist.

1080
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,340
I guess.
Maybe jumped to guard.

1081
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,880
Yeah,
we kind of jumped into garden.

1082
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,860
It's amazing
what he can do.

1083
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:42,780
His little bodies.
Just crazy.

1084
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,850
Yeah.
How much core strength is a raccoon?

1085
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,530
Have to have to do that.
Oh Dude,

1086
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,450
so much.
And they garbage.

1087
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,790
It's just freezing.
I hit pause on perfect.

1088
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,490
They can eat newspaper.
How crazy is that?

1089
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,790
Can they can play that,
but keep going this,

1090
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,380
look at this,
but look how comfortable he is hanging

1091
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:01,320
from his fingers with all four limbs.

1092
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,170
Like he's just chilling.
He's not worried that something's going

1093
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,160
to happen.
He's like,

1094
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,020
hmm,
let me just scoot my ass up here.

1095
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:07,831
Climb,
climb,

1096
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:10,590
climb.
I'm just going to twist this fucker off

1097
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,430
here.
Look at him.

1098
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,330
He's hanging on with his legs and he
could just cracked it open and now look

1099
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:16,400
at this reverse.
Look at this

1100
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,890
at the end,
but the crazy thing is he could hold

1101
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:24,891
onto that plastic tube with his hands
and feet to of each two of his hands or

1102
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:27,540
to have his feet or their hands.
Look at the size of their body,

1103
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,590
their hands.
This big tiny.

1104
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,730
Could you imagine having a little bitty
baby hand and having to do something.

1105
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,541
I know,
right?

1106
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,310
Look how much smarter hand is in their
face.

1107
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,410
You'd have hands like a four year old
girl.

1108
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,470
Imagine opening a door,
but you can't even open a door.

1109
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,380
You just have to stare at a door knob
with little bro.

1110
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:47,020
I'm talking the littlest hands.
Tiny.

1111
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:48,850
They'll fuck you up to those things.
Yeah.

1112
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,640
Raccoons eat a lot of chickens too.
They like to get into chicken coops.

1113
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,650
Fuck up chickens.
They would jump on your back.

1114
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:55,300
It was almost the.
Here's the crazy thing I remember about

1115
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:58,030
being around raccoons.
It felt like they were playing with you,

1116
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:02,260
but had an immediate propensity for
violence like gay could go like very

1117
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:07,261
quick from fun and comfortable to
extremely violent.

1118
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,340
It makes sense.
I mean,

1119
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:13,130
what a rough and tumble world.
The world of the raccoons mother fucker.

1120
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,070
They live at night.
Look at your swing the door.

1121
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,420
Look at this now.
I think this is a close the door here

1122
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:22,420
and it opens it again.
My grandmother had a friend that had a

1123
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:26,980
couple
so he just knows how to open doors.

1124
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,413
Creepy.
Fuck.

1125
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:33,670
There's something weird about them.
Just a strange animal that like almost

1126
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:35,650
seems like it shouldn't be real.
You know,

1127
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:38,740
like a smart,
weird animal that lives in the forest.

1128
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:42,100
Like you expected to start talking to a
little kid that's on a walk.

1129
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,070
Like who?
Who are you?

1130
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Where are you from?
And it's.

1131
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,020
Yeah,
it's got dice and it's little hand one

1132
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:51,220
dice.
This turnover.

1133
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,460
Your grandmother won't mind if you hang
out with me.

1134
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,630
Show you a house.
It's made of candy.

1135
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,220
Yeah.
You want some lipstick?

1136
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:05,580
Putting lipstick on her creepy animals,
but that's weird to me.

1137
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,660
The weirder animals,
the animals that have adapted to living

1138
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,650
right next to people that them.
Coyotes.

1139
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,420
Coyotes.
That's them.

1140
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,460
Are you telling me about a coyote you
had at your house?

1141
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,060
I've got a bunch of them at my house.
They're just in the,

1142
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,310
you know in the hills.
If you live anywhere around la in

1143
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:24,400
particular,
anywhere that there's some trees and

1144
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:26,290
shit in between the houses,
guess what?

1145
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,130
You got?
Coyotes.

1146
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,510
They just fucking live everywhere,
man.

1147
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,760
I saw him on all of in Burbank the other
day,

1148
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,640
driving up all of our soft fucking
coyotes.

1149
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:34,474
I was like,
whoa.

1150
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:37,360
Somebody who reported a cody fight in my
neighborhood when I was growing up and

1151
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:39,910
it was somebody made that up,
but the cops still showed up and I

1152
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,200
remember they interviewed everybody
like,

1153
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:42,340
we fucking do anything about it.

1154
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:47,230
Do you think kind of what he's fight
wonder if they do fight with each other?

1155
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,800
I don't think I've ever heard of him
fighting at this.

1156
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,350
It must make sense.
Someone has to be the boss and the

1157
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:54,820
coyote world.
Wolves.

1158
00:49:54,821 --> 00:49:56,230
Do Wolves.
Fuck each other up.

1159
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,380
Do they really?
Yeah.

1160
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,760
So awful to kill each other.
So He's a coyote.

1161
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:03,200
Fights here.
Most intense coyote.

1162
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:04,211
Oh,
look at this.

1163
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:06,570
They're going to war right here it is on
Worldstar.

1164
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,790
Worldstar.
That's where you draw back right there.

1165
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,410
Look at that.
And other one jumped in.

1166
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:15,970
Three coyotes strategically held by
Bush.

1167
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,730
Do you fuck they're fucking each other
up.

1168
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:21,160
Dude.
Do you think we could ever get to the

1169
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:25,570
point where you know that humans fight
animals like they did back in the old

1170
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:25,990
days?
You know,

1171
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,350
like gladiator style?
Yeah.

1172
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,090
Seriously though.

1173
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:29,810
Yeah.
You could do that in another country for

1174
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:30,920
sure.
Yeah.

1175
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,390
If somebody from some crazy country
where they had some maniacal dicker

1176
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:40,220
dictator who's on crystal meth and he
decided to have humans versus lions

1177
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:42,600
given to a sword and the shield and
armor and him.

1178
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,650
Fuck up a 100 percent.
Do you think that goes on?

1179
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,630
Um,
I wouldn't say no.

1180
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,520
Yeah,
because I think there's people with

1181
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:55,610
enough money,
like fucking crazy,

1182
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:58,140
crazy prints money.
Oh yeah.

1183
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:00,200
If there are prints of some crazy
country,

1184
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,140
there's people just probably can't get
satisfied.

1185
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,950
It's not.
They can't get any.

1186
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,170
Hillary's.
Yeah.

1187
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,490
Cocaine,
pussy,

1188
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,500
pussy,
jets.

1189
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,900
Oh,
islands in France.

1190
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,720
Like what else do I want?
What else I want?

1191
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,120
I want to watch a dude fight a lion with
a sword.

1192
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,050
Yeah.
This is probably like some place that

1193
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:20,930
you can go.
Right.

1194
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,550
And it's got like a drains in the floor
where they hose it down from all the

1195
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:28,370
blood and it's built like a hockey rink.

1196
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,660
Yeah.
But uh,

1197
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,480
the floor underneath the floor,
this is zoo just like that.

1198
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:34,620
They used to do it in the Roman days and
uh,

1199
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,250
it rises up,
they let the animal out,

1200
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:42,080
close it down and then they opened the
cage and the fucking dude stands there

1201
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:46,790
with the sword and the crowd goes and
they're all listening to techno music

1202
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,640
and speak in Dutch.
And then

1203
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,900
suddenly we know where they are at.
Dude,

1204
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:55,640
in that fucking lie.
And Go to war.

1205
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,840
They go at it,
man.

1206
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,930
Yeah.
He think he has like face paint on or

1207
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:02,870
anything or he's just [inaudible].
It was probably a good move.

1208
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:03,950
Pull a face.
Paint on.

1209
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,320
You need every edge.
Yeah.

1210
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,430
You know you got to fight a line with a
sword.

1211
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:10,730
You probably gonna get killed.
You're going to cut the line and then

1212
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,030
get killed.
That's what you're going to do.

1213
00:52:12,031 --> 00:52:13,250
Then you get one good hit at it.

1214
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,700
If you're lucky.
Probably won't even really it.

1215
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,690
Yeah.
You swordman yeah.

1216
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,260
You.
You don't have any idea how slow you are

1217
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:24,980
until you're around a cat that kills
antelopes and shit.

1218
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,340
Chases after willdabeast takes him out
with his face.

1219
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,880
You're just that you.
You have no idea.

1220
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,300
I think everybody.
No,

1221
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,500
I don't think you get a shot off.
I think with the cat wants to the cats

1222
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:39,860
on you so fast.
You barely have time to move your arm.

1223
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,260
That's what I think.
I don't think.

1224
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,860
Yeah.
I don't think you have any idea how fast

1225
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,440
a.
like a real Predator moves and how

1226
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:50,920
ridiculously soft human beings are.
Right.

1227
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,220
Especially if you're not.
Some.

1228
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:56,390
I don't fucking Conan the barbarian due
to can actually swing a sword,

1229
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:59,750
a heavy sword with some fucking oomph
behind it.

1230
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,400
Yeah.
You ever pick up a real sword?

1231
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,900
It's heavy as shit,
man.

1232
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:06,530
It's fucking heavy and it's sharp.
It's almost scary to have one sometimes.

1233
00:53:06,531 --> 00:53:07,341
Yeah.
Like fuck.

1234
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:10,730
I would hurt myself or I'd cut my cousin
up or something on accident or had hurt

1235
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:11,930
somebody at the house.
Yeah.

1236
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:16,580
The odds of you killing that lion with
one swipe or almost zero,

1237
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,650
you're going to get fucked up.
Okay.

1238
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:20,750
How would you attack it then?
Say you're in a place.

1239
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:23,270
You've got this sword.
Maybe got one other weapon,

1240
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:25,140
a small weapon you keep on your leg or
something.

1241
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,520
The only way

1242
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,120
that I think you have a chance is if you
can keep your shit together and plugins

1243
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:35,250
that blade and it's chest as it leaps on
you

1244
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:41,750
as the only way you would have to be
ready to as it comes at you to push

1245
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:47,460
forward and hold onto that sword with
everything you have as it's coming at

1246
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:50,970
you and the blade goes into its body.
That might be the only way,

1247
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,020
and even then it's going to walk you and
rip you apart.

1248
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,350
You want.
You're not going to be able to.

1249
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:00,380
It's not possible.
I think he could do it to.

1250
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,250
Nope.
Nope.

1251
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,600
You don't think you could.
No.

1252
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,670
No.
And you would keep both hands on.

1253
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:06,780
Now.
That's how you acted it out.

1254
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,810
You keep both hands on it.
You are not going to be able to hang on.

1255
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,870
You're just not.
It's a different kind of power.

1256
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,790
It's the power of many,
many men.

1257
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:17,760
It's like the idea of a who borrowed.
You think you could win a tug of war

1258
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:18,810
with 10 dudes?
Yeah.

1259
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:21,000
Fuck Yeah Bro.
Most guys are bitches.

1260
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,150
Do you have a chance?
There's a strength level.

1261
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:31,160
You'd have to be like some Herculean,
Marriott's,

1262
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,740
Pooja,
Nowatzski type dudes.

1263
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:37,810
Some enormous fucking world's strongest
man guy with chalk all over your hands

1264
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:42,240
and a good grip on the blade and maybe
tie it down like a Rodeo rider plunging

1265
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,280
into the heart of a lion.
And even then,

1266
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,520
I don't think you're hanging onto it.
I think that things gonna Book and kick

1267
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:50,970
and and you're going to be so terrified
if it's a male lion,

1268
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,050
you get to see that main in that face
and your body scare you.

1269
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,370
You're going to get diminished.
Yeah.

1270
00:54:56,371 --> 00:54:58,140
You're going to be so overwhelmed with
adrenaline.

1271
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:02,070
Your instinct is going to be to just run
away from that thing as far as you can.

1272
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:05,390
Do you feel like some truths as like any
truths,

1273
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:08,640
like any innate truth would be revealed
as you're,

1274
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,280
as you're sitting here looking at each
other's eyes and you know that it's

1275
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:14,400
going to kill you.
I don't think you're even there at that

1276
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,660
point.
I think if you're.

1277
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:20,661
I think you're such a primal experience
that I think at that point you are

1278
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,570
probably.
You're barely a human.

1279
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,460
You're just a series of synapses firing
that are designed to protect you from

1280
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:31,680
predators.
I think you just in full panic,

1281
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,870
full adrenaline rush,
full survival mode where you don't.

1282
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:38,790
You don't know what the fuck is going
on.

1283
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,860
I have some friends.
Fuck man.

1284
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,790
I've got some friends that got a
taxpayer there.

1285
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:46,350
They got attacked by a giant grizzly
bear and they.

1286
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,730
No,
everybody got away survived luckily,

1287
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:56,150
but they were in.
They were in an island off of Alaska,

1288
00:55:56,641 --> 00:56:01,020
of fog neck island,
and it's a huge population of brown

1289
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:03,290
bears and elk and they all lived
together.

1290
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,090
These,
these fucking parents are huge and this

1291
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:08,160
bear,
which was like an 11 foot bear,

1292
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,900
charged into their camp and knocked
everyone over like guys were flying left

1293
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:15,960
and right.
One of the dudes is a nicknames.

1294
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,480
Dartmouth,
Dartmouth was riding on the back.

1295
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,390
If you want to hear the whole story and
it's a great story,

1296
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:26,750
go to the mediator and I think the
episodes just say a fog.

1297
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:30,670
Neck island.
I don't know if it says bear attack on a

1298
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:32,860
fog neck island,
but if you're a.

1299
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,640
If you're a clever googler,
you'll find it's a great podcast.

1300
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:38,500
Anyway,
Steve Rainelle is a genius.

1301
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:40,630
He's a really interesting guy and a
hunter,

1302
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,460
like we just totally,
totally

1303
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,700
defies the stereotype that people have
of like doofy hunters like super well

1304
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:49,090
read.

1305
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:52,450
Really interesting guy,
but his depiction of this event,

1306
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,720
the most striking thing about it was
that it defied everything that he

1307
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:58,660
thought it would be like if there was an
actual bear attack.

1308
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,850
Sounds like hemingway esque almost in a
weird way.

1309
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,140
Well know in a weird way.
Yeah.

1310
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:05,260
Because when look,
if something really fucking crazy

1311
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:08,380
happens,
the best case scenario is there someone

1312
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:11,140
who actually knows how to write.
That's right there.

1313
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,530
When this something crazy happened and
this is the case,

1314
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,160
but instead of writing it,
he just does a very eloquent job of

1315
00:57:18,161 --> 00:57:19,990
describing it as does everybody else
there.

1316
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:21,690
I mean,
there was quite a few guys there.

1317
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:26,710
My friend Rammi Warren was there and
Yonis will tell us this is one where

1318
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:29,620
they got um,
false attacked.

1319
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,300
This was in British Columbia.
They got false charged of false charge

1320
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:36,430
is a bear this,
in this case,

1321
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:40,300
it was a bear with cubs and she just
want to scare them off.

1322
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:45,301
So she came running at them full clip.
It's crazy to see because they fired

1323
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:48,550
near her,
but they had the discipline to not fire

1324
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,610
her.
I'm like,

1325
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:54,630
that is really impressive because this
thing just came fucking running at them

1326
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:57,520
and it's huge.
Like here it is.

1327
00:57:58,410 --> 00:57:59,620
Like give me some volume here.

1328
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:08,260
Oh my God,
I will shoot to kill this

1329
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:16,950
peels off man's away and Callahan says
I'll never forget.

1330
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:20,950
I want to give them a tee shirt with him
and his mustache and this smell us now

1331
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,530
it smells now lady.
That's a sentence that comes to mind,

1332
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:31,390
so that is what he had experienced
before and so he,

1333
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:35,790
he kind of kept his composure in that
situation and he was like this other one

1334
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:41,420
where the grizzly bear literally knocked
them over to the teeth were gnashing 10

1335
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:45,030
inches from his face.
It was just so many people.

1336
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,670
The grizzly probably didn't expect there
to be that many people there.

1337
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:50,310
There was like seven people there is
that my views.

1338
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:51,630
Let me think of how many people.
One,

1339
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:52,464
two,
three.

1340
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:56,190
At least five people there and I think
that's what saved him,

1341
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:59,280
but the camera people to is.
It probably was about seven people and I

1342
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:03,720
think that's what saved them.
The fact that this was a giant mass of

1343
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:05,910
people and the bear didn't know which
way to go,

1344
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:09,000
and one of the dudes Yanas hit it in the
face with trekking poles.

1345
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,953
You know,
there's trekking poles.

1346
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,750
He said it was right there,
smacked in the face and thing.

1347
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,610
Veered off.
One of the guys,

1348
00:59:14,611 --> 00:59:16,040
remy,
he juked it.

1349
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:18,520
He faked right.
And then went laugh on the bear.

1350
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,880
There was just so much going on.
The bear just ran through it.

1351
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,980
One of the guys wound

1352
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,660
up on the bears back now for like 10
yards there was running and he was

1353
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:29,480
somehow into the stuck on the bears back
and then fell off.

1354
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:33,500
This is how big the bear was in.
I think we need to see a bear,

1355
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:34,940
man.
You don't think it's going to be like

1356
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:37,880
that,
that intense,

1357
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:39,740
you know,
you don't think it because the first

1358
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:42,100
picture they showed that bear,
he seemed like a calm Bayer,

1359
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:42,980
you know,
look at that bear.

1360
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,440
I've seen him in.
The worst thing about bears is they

1361
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:49,400
advertise them mostly Disney movies.
How do you see a bear teddy bear?

1362
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,990
You know what I'm saying?
Uh,

1363
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,690
you know,
they have fucking bearish fucking to on

1364
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:55,070
the Internet,
you have all that kind of shit,

1365
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:57,150
but it's like sweeties.
Yes,

1366
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,080
they're your buddy.
They're your buddy.

1367
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,060
Meanwhile,
how about those little kids that their

1368
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:03,290
dad got eaten in front of them?

1369
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,370
I mean,
what do those little kids,

1370
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:07,850
what if they had a little pet polar bear
that's not outside the realm of

1371
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:11,360
possibility with little kids and you get
convinced that that's what those animals

1372
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:12,300
are.
Look,

1373
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,900
I'm not saying you shouldn't have a pet
stuffed polar bear.

1374
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:17,090
They're cute.
It's not a path.

1375
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:18,140
But you know what I'm saying?
A toy.

1376
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,620
Would you have a little barrier thing as
a pet?

1377
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,640
No fucking way.
Man released.

1378
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,730
Ridiculous.
He seemed like a guy that might have a

1379
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:28,190
little vague to that dude.
Fuck that.

1380
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,590
First of all,
they're not listening to you.

1381
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:32,690
Get Away with all that.
They might be your friend,

1382
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,340
it might be your friend as they grow
older,

1383
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,140
but you better keep that food around
bitch.

1384
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:39,260
And even if you have that food around,
you can't keep them from killing other

1385
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,660
people.
Like there was a guy who has his bear

1386
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:43,790
trained look at the size of that fucker.

1387
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,760
Oh my God,
this guy's definitely probably.

1388
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,460
Oh my God,
this was like a gay.

1389
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,030
If you keep this animal fed,
there are people that have bears.

1390
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:56,040
Does this in Russia is Russia.
Yeah.

1391
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,560
So if there's people that keep bears fed
and take care of them and treat them

1392
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:01,790
well,
you know,

1393
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,420
and this is the thing about bears too,
is at burt bears are omnivores.

1394
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,830
They eat everything.
Oh really?

1395
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:09,200
Hate animals.
They vegetables,

1396
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:11,270
they eat everything.
Yeah,

1397
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,180
it's crazy.
They're like people in a lot of way in

1398
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:15,150
that they are,
you know,

1399
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:17,690
their diet very so they don't have to
eat,

1400
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,500
they don't have to kill things.
Didn't necessarily have the desire to

1401
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:23,710
chase things down and killed things like
a cat does.

1402
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,360
Like cats have a deep desire to kill
things.

1403
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,400
Like cats can't shake that shit.
Yeah,

1404
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,550
I think you could,
you could feed a bear well and take care

1405
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:33,320
of it and you could probably avoid most
of that.

1406
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,270
But if it ever feels threatened in any
way,

1407
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:37,970
you're so fucked.
And do you think you have any like

1408
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,920
there,
you might not even notice when that bear

1409
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:42,050
feels that way,
but I wouldn't.

1410
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:44,430
I'm not a beer expert.
I think a real bear expert would see

1411
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,550
that something's weird.
The Bears Act and sketchy

1412
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,310
or bears like.
Yeah,

1413
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:51,740
they just.
They start acting irritated.

1414
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,840
Look at the size of these things,
man.

1415
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,570
This guy is definitely a pervert.
You think so?

1416
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,080
Yeah.
This because I think there's got to be

1417
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:05,081
something inside of you that gets off in
a weird way to do this.

1418
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:10,010
I don't think this feels natural.
I think they're intoxicated by powerful

1419
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:13,490
animals and having these powerful
animals around gives them a thrill.

1420
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:15,350
Okay.
The thrill has to be.

1421
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:17,330
Do you think that that,
that they could kill him.

1422
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,890
That's it.
One hundred percent.

1423
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:19,900
And also did like

1424
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,740
the thrill is they are beautiful
creatures,

1425
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:26,370
so you do want to be around them.
They're cool to just be around and if

1426
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:28,290
you,
you can make friends with this beautiful

1427
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,540
creature that could just kill a mass of
people.

1428
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,090
It's kind of feels fun.
Dangerous.

1429
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,020
Yeah.
That's cool.

1430
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:35,740
It feels dangerous.
It's like a celebrity.

1431
01:02:35,741 --> 01:02:38,160
It's like no one else,
John or are way better.

1432
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,350
You got a pet grizzly come over my
house,

1433
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:42,720
motherfucker.
I got a 12 foot dog that lives in my

1434
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,960
house,
you know,

1435
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,700
like,
but cats seed.

1436
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:48,460
That's it.
No more.

1437
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,500
These are different animals.
This is a different thing,

1438
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,510
but I think if people have an animal
like that,

1439
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:56,430
they're fucking next to it at night and
they're doing.

1440
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:58,690
I think some of them shouldn't be.
Yeah,

1441
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,560
probably near it.
I don't think they're getting involved

1442
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:03,120
with them,
but I think they're doing near it.

1443
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,390
But just fuck right next to the tiger
and get them horny.

1444
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:10,080
What do beastiality needs?
Because I've thought this about

1445
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:12,840
beastiality and I don't know if we've
even talked about this,

1446
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,170
but if you have sex with a local animal,
something that lives here,

1447
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,530
how livestock,
chickens,

1448
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,920
something like that.
It's fucked up.

1449
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,230
It's fucked up and it's not,
you know,

1450
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,480
you know,
travel overseas with the specific

1451
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:26,730
intention of having sex with an animal.
Okay.

1452
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:27,600
That's,
to me,

1453
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:29,160
that's so fucked up.
You know,

1454
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:30,750
the rules are different depending on who
you ask.

1455
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:34,620
Probably locally,
but I'm sure in some places they're like

1456
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,290
me some money and you can do whatever
you want it.

1457
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:37,770
I go,
no,

1458
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,430
but if you.
If you fuck a mountain lion,

1459
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,890
that's a strong man.
That's how I.

1460
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,640
that's it,
Dude.

1461
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,390
You never buy a beer again.
You fuck a mountain?

1462
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,900
You fuck a links that to me,
that's not beastiality.

1463
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:54,870
To me,
that's like some Ragnar Loft Brooke type

1464
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:55,321
Shit.
Yeah.

1465
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:57,840
That's the bravest thing you can do.
That's a viking shit.

1466
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,690
Imagine a trying to keep an erection and
then sneak up on a bucket animals,

1467
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,810
but you'd have to.
You have to figure out a way to hold him

1468
01:04:03,811 --> 01:04:07,230
down and you think there's ever a guy
the best of the mountain line then

1469
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:09,120
fucked it.
See,

1470
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,580
I
don't think.

1471
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,800
I believe there might be another Theo
Vaughn or an infinite number of them out

1472
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:20,190
in the universe talking to another me
and that were sitting in the exact same.

1473
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,230
The exact same notes.
I believe that.

1474
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,760
I'm not sure I believe any of those
people on any of those plants that have

1475
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:28,050
planets ever fucked a mountain lion.
I don't know.

1476
01:04:28,051 --> 01:04:30,010
A long time ago.
You don't think that when?

1477
01:04:30,011 --> 01:04:31,410
No,
but there's no youtube.

1478
01:04:31,411 --> 01:04:34,050
There was nobody to tell.
The only person who knows is the other

1479
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:35,820
two people.
People are gonna think they're lying

1480
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,380
because they're alcoholics.
You could eat.

1481
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,570
I don't think so,
dude.

1482
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,700
I don't think there's any squirrels that
rape people either.

1483
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:46,701
You know what I'm saying?
I think that that's more likely.

1484
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,710
It's more likely that a squirrel would
rape a person.

1485
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,150
Oh,
I could see a school kind of funk.

1486
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,100
Someone's drunk who passed out in their
yard.

1487
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,610
That's more likely.
Like a crazy super horny squirrel.

1488
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:58,680
Just can't keep it together.
He keeps [inaudible] up.

1489
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:01,050
Yeah.
Some Kappa Delta just passed out on her

1490
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:02,130
fucking yard.
You know,

1491
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,260
had many peanut butter.
Crazy.

1492
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:06,810
I do not think that a guy could fuck
them out in line.

1493
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:10,710
I just don't think that's ever happened.
Especially not gay sex.

1494
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:13,950
Right.
Maybe a female mountain lion might let

1495
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:16,780
you.
She's all wild up and heat and why

1496
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:21,670
eat my friend,
wasn't it Chris Ryan talked about

1497
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:24,040
fucking his cat with a pencil.
Did he gave me a shirt?

1498
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:24,790
Salt.
That's right.

1499
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,450
He did.
That's his shirt.

1500
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:31,460
He tells a great story about his cat was
in heat and she backed up to him.

1501
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,050
She was like trying to get some Dick and
he put a pencil in their giddy,

1502
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,930
like a little kid.
He was like a little kid.

1503
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:41,260
Yes.
Sherry was an adult sexual experience.

1504
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,410
Was this cat backing up on this pencil?
Yeah,

1505
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,910
I could imagine.
I did.

1506
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:47,910
I remember getting like an erection and
just,

1507
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,410
I remember just hold it against fucking
did.

1508
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:53,830
I remember being at the library when I
was young and this is back when they

1509
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:54,550
had,
um,

1510
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,420
books,
you know,

1511
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,170
what do they have now?
I mean,

1512
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,380
you don't fucking know her library still
open.

1513
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:01,500
Who's hitting their.
Just people trying to finger each other.

1514
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,590
Who was in a fucking liar.
You even imagined,

1515
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:10,620
I guess books about homeless people
allow homeless people in libraries.

1516
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,270
Yeah.
Can we just start calling them shelters?

1517
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,010
You know what I'm saying?
And serve lunch.

1518
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,130
But I remember going in there and the
only sex you could see at the time,

1519
01:06:19,131 --> 01:06:20,800
it was like Rodin or something like
that.

1520
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:24,340
Or these old artists remember they would
paint like a reuben ask one by shooting

1521
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:24,790
him and shoot.

1522
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:27,160
But like this,
you see breasts instead of one of her

1523
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:30,460
hands.
Like this weird thing with the hands.

1524
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:34,000
Right?
Everything was always this way.

1525
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:38,860
Why is that?
But I remember like opposed indicative

1526
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:43,510
of a certain time and history I guess
because it's really hard to draw a hand.

1527
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,010
Oh,
that could be it.

1528
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:49,000
Maybe somebody drew it.
But if you think that like emperors

1529
01:06:49,001 --> 01:06:53,540
would stand there and do this to their,
to their people like you now look,

1530
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,110
there's two things to trump could do
that.

1531
01:06:56,111 --> 01:07:00,010
People would freak the fuck out.
One of them obviously he's like a sieg

1532
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:00,521
Heil.
Yeah,

1533
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:02,890
that's bad.
The other one that might be just as bad

1534
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:06,990
as the emperor.
He comes out with one hand almost like

1535
01:07:06,991 --> 01:07:09,670
he's holding an invisible football.
On the other hand,

1536
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:15,090
do this and just addressed to people.
People will blow a gasket.

1537
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:19,040
He wants to be.
The emperor wants me to Buckingham for.

1538
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:20,800
Oh my God,
dude,

1539
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:23,410
he should start wearing a crown.
How great would it be if he started

1540
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:24,850
wearing a crown?
Dude?

1541
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:27,160
It would be hilarious if you started
wearing like a cheap burger.

1542
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:29,010
King one just didn't say nothing about
it.

1543
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,570
I bet he will.
Do you think he.

1544
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:35,440
I think he has a sense of humor.
He definitely does.

1545
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:36,221
Yeah.
He definitely.

1546
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:39,850
He's the first president that has ever
been roasted on comedy central.

1547
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:40,870
Oh,
that's a great point,

1548
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,900
dude.
He got roasted on comedy central and

1549
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,160
Jeff Ross even said to him like,
like ya'll laughing at the jokes,

1550
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:48,820
I could.
She'd probably laugh at them like,

1551
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:49,654
don't,
don't.

1552
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:53,740
It's probably people like it better if
you're going along with it.

1553
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:54,180
He's like,
yeah,

1554
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,220
you're right.
And then he loosened up and started

1555
01:07:56,221 --> 01:07:59,140
laughing.
So he takes advice from people that are

1556
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,380
in the business.
They told some ruthless jokes about him.

1557
01:08:02,381 --> 01:08:04,320
Man.
He hung up.

1558
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:05,920
Mary handled it.
I liked in keys,

1559
01:08:05,921 --> 01:08:08,050
resilient.
Whether or not he can feel any of that

1560
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,430
because of his like,
uh,

1561
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,570
whatever.
Ego spaces.

1562
01:08:10,571 --> 01:08:12,340
And I wonder how much of that even
feels,

1563
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,100
but only he,
he might be the only human in America

1564
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:20,230
could take this much hatred from people
at such a level that.

1565
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,270
Yeah.
And it doesn't even care.

1566
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,350
It's weird.
Yeah.

1567
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,461
It's,
I mean,

1568
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:27,200
it's fucking,
it's kind of awesome.

1569
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:27,771
It's Kinda.
Oh,

1570
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:30,740
I remember after he got elected driving
down the street and being like,

1571
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:31,760
Holy Shit,
dude,

1572
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:36,950
I could be president puking anybody.
That was what we thought when we were

1573
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:39,080
kids,
to what's awesome about his.

1574
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,940
And when I say awesome,
I don't mean good.

1575
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,410
I mean amazing about his abilities.
Like all throughout all this crazy shit.

1576
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:50,411
He doesn't show any signs of being like,
it doesn't seem to be like freaked out

1577
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:56,430
right over the stormy Daniels Shit or
over the rush sugar,

1578
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:01,420
all the investigations.
Occasionally he goes mad tweetstorm.

1579
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,760
Yeah.
He seems to be the same guy he was

1580
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:06,680
before.
He doesn't seem to be.

1581
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,400
There's certain dudes when you see
something like,

1582
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:12,080
um,
it was a good example.

1583
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,350
Something fucked up happens to them and
you see it in their face.

1584
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:16,570
They're like,
whoa.

1585
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,770
Like George Bush,
whenever maybe on that video in the nine

1586
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,990
slash one or whenever they see the
pictures and they told him about nine.

1587
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,580
Well,
nine slash 11 was huge thing.

1588
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:24,680
That's.
I don't think he knew how huge it was at

1589
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:26,630
the time.
It was all breaking out.

1590
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,820
You know,
the bad example.

1591
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:29,601
Yeah.
But yeah,

1592
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:34,090
trump just seems totally unaffected.
Just same.

1593
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,340
No more senior citizens on twitter that,
that's a thing senior citizens on

1594
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:39,350
twitter is kind of bizarre.
Oh,

1595
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:41,270
there's a lot of them now.
They love it.

1596
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,260
Will they take a break every couple of
minutes of doing facebook all day,

1597
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:47,620
yelling at people on facebook.
Great.

1598
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,720
Everybody hates.
The guy says,

1599
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,290
I don't think everybody's.
I think a lot of people like the time

1600
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:55,940
we're in right now because it's so.
It just,

1601
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,860
I feel like you know what you're going
to get,

1602
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:58,790
you know.

1603
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,570
No,
it's,

1604
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,970
it's a strange time for communication,
man.

1605
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:04,760
It really is a strange time for
everything.

1606
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:05,781
Yeah,
man.

1607
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:07,580
It's uh,
it's different.

1608
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,970
It's so different that it's fucking,
it's kind of fascinating.

1609
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:11,804
I had,
um,

1610
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,870
that got Jordan Peterson came on
podcast.

1611
01:10:13,871 --> 01:10:17,060
He hasn't met him on your podcast,
which was wild because I know his

1612
01:10:17,061 --> 01:10:18,610
publicist,
um,

1613
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:21,530
and I reached out and the publicist,
um,

1614
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:24,190
and then it was wild and so then he came
through because I mean,

1615
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,970
a lot of the people listen to my
podcast,

1616
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:27,490
her,
you know,

1617
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:31,280
we talk a lot about like being sober and
like people that masturbate too much,

1618
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:32,310
kind of weird stuff,
you know,

1619
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:34,160
troubled youths.
Kind of I'll say it,

1620
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,103
right.
Um,

1621
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:38,210
but anyway,
it was cool because he like,

1622
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,450
I don't know,
you know,

1623
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,041
better than I do.
Um,

1624
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:42,320
he loves you.
He said a lot of Nice things about,

1625
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,041
oh,
that's nice.

1626
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:45,290
He's a great guy.
He's really misunderstood,

1627
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,480
man.
Misrepresented people think he's some

1628
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:50,300
fascist and some Nazi.
I didn't think that at all.

1629
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,220
He's not by any stretch of the
imagination.

1630
01:10:52,221 --> 01:10:55,760
He just says certain things that people
are uncomfortable hearing and whether

1631
01:10:55,761 --> 01:10:57,290
you agree with them or disagree with
them,

1632
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:00,380
that's one thing.
But that's what the demonization is

1633
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,900
where it gets weird.
Even if you would think he's what his

1634
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:06,590
idea is foolish.
Don't misrepresent who he is as a person

1635
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:10,310
because they try to pretend that he's
this racist,

1636
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:13,860
homophobic,
fucking character.

1637
01:11:13,861 --> 01:11:14,070
He's

1638
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:19,070
not by any stretch of the imagination.
He's just a guy that especially when his

1639
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:23,690
principles are being debated or when his
ideas are being tested like he,

1640
01:11:23,691 --> 01:11:27,720
he'll stand his ground and he's very
firm about what he thinks is wrong about

1641
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:32,190
things like equality of outcome,
like making sure that everybody makes

1642
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:34,410
the same amount of money,
make sure that everybody achieves the

1643
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:38,130
same amount of success like that is a
ridiculous idea that leads to communism

1644
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:42,270
and Marxism and he gets into it and it
made me rethink how I thought about it

1645
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:43,740
before.
Then I thought about it before then,

1646
01:11:43,741 --> 01:11:47,850
like an unattainable goal that socialist
lean towards because it's like the

1647
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:50,190
ideal.
The ideal is that money's not a concern

1648
01:11:50,191 --> 01:11:53,310
for anybody and everybody just sort of
does whatever they want to do because

1649
01:11:53,311 --> 01:11:55,500
they enjoy doing it,
not because they're doing it for money

1650
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:58,200
and then all the money kind of piled in
together and we take care of everybody.

1651
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,490
It sounds great on paper,
right?

1652
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,380
But then he starts talking about,
no,

1653
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:04,530
you have to enforce an equality of
outcome,

1654
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,160
right?
He goes,

1655
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,170
when you're talking about a quick,
there's going to be people that work

1656
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:09,480
harder,
there's going to be able to try harder.

1657
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:12,510
There's going to be different varying
levels of effort because we're human

1658
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:14,650
beings.
You have to take that into consideration

1659
01:12:14,651 --> 01:12:17,490
and as soon as these people don't take
that into consideration,

1660
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,900
it's then you're,
you're,

1661
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:23,550
you're either trying to stop the people
that are doing too well or you're trying

1662
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,970
to take from them to give to yourself
and how you enforcing this.

1663
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:28,740
And he's,
he just takes you down this rabbit hole

1664
01:12:28,741 --> 01:12:33,180
of thought and really kind of explains
the problems with Marxism and socialism.

1665
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:36,510
And I'm sure there's really intelligent
people that dispute his ideas.

1666
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:40,140
I'm not saying that his ideas are
infallible or that he's the only voice

1667
01:12:40,141 --> 01:12:41,490
that I would listen to in these
subjects.

1668
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,280
But he's a brilliant guy and he's a very
nice guy too.

1669
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:47,790
And he's really missing,
misrepresented and in willfully.

1670
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:51,780
So a lot.
I think it's sad because I think what's

1671
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:56,610
missing between right and the left is
how much vit we we would probably agree

1672
01:12:56,611 --> 01:13:00,030
on and if we could just talk about
things rationally instead of

1673
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:03,270
contentiously instead of getting into
these right versus left debates which

1674
01:13:03,271 --> 01:13:07,470
are just way too common where
everybody's on one side is trying to

1675
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,070
diminish the person in their side and,
and,

1676
01:13:09,071 --> 01:13:12,240
and get angry and they're doing a lot of
these in front of big crowds,

1677
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,050
which I think is also weird because then
you're playing to the crowd and I've

1678
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:18,990
seen some things that Jordan did with
this Michael Eric Dyson guy with the guy

1679
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:21,870
was literally wasn't looking at him.
He's looking at the crowd,

1680
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:27,050
calling him a mean mad white man and
it's like I see these kinds of things

1681
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,130
that people are doing.

1682
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:32,130
It's just everyone's just digging their
heels in deeper on each side and instead

1683
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:36,720
of looking at life like just having an
open conversation about things that are

1684
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:39,510
troubling things where we could do
better things,

1685
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:43,920
where society needs work or things.
Maybe where our perceptions are off and

1686
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:46,470
maybe we could look at the other side
and look at each other or look at the

1687
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:49,590
whole thing better and figure out a
better way around things instead of

1688
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,780
doing that,
everybody's just right versus left and

1689
01:13:51,781 --> 01:13:55,680
right and deeper in the trenches and
harder and we've got to stop trump and I

1690
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,490
hope we have a recession to stop trump
and people saying crazy shit crazy like

1691
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:02,850
everybody's supposed to suffer so that
you can make one guy feel like he's

1692
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,090
doing a bad job or just not the way to
approach it.

1693
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,400
Like you've seen that.
What is that woman's name?

1694
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:10,020
Maxine.
What is her name?

1695
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,980
Maximum trump.
I

1696
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,700
call her dark trump.
She says she's,

1697
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:19,110
she's wild to interrupt people's meals
and draw a crowd and like,

1698
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:25,180
you know,
and I guess it's in response to what is

1699
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:30,370
the most disturbing policy was a
separate children from their parents.

1700
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:33,370
People that are crossing the border,
but I think he didn't.

1701
01:14:33,371 --> 01:14:36,490
He decided to put a stop to that.
Then they decided to put a stop to that.

1702
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,320
Did he sign something to put a stop to
that?

1703
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,850
Well,
it's definitely scary if you're doing

1704
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:41,590
that at the border.
They did,

1705
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,680
but I don't know.
I read that it didn't do any change

1706
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:45,514
anything.
Oh really?

1707
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:49,370
Let's find out what the fuck that means.
We'll find out what would happen.

1708
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:52,560
I know it's hard to do that and I,
I mean,

1709
01:14:52,561 --> 01:14:53,830
yeah.
How do you separate people from their

1710
01:14:53,831 --> 01:14:57,010
kids?
You gotta be you gotta be trying to send

1711
01:14:57,011 --> 01:15:00,310
some fucked up message to scare the shit
out of him so that'll keep them from

1712
01:15:00,311 --> 01:15:00,880
coming over.

1713
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,260
This is the idea.
I guess if you tell them you're going to

1714
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:05,680
take their kids away,
they probably won't even try and then.

1715
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:07,120
But what about this say if like,
you know,

1716
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:11,020
everybody's against like sex trafficking
and I'm not like what if one of those

1717
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:14,410
people is that scenario and the kids too
afraid to say it.

1718
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:16,840
I know that's like a maybe more of an
acute situation,

1719
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,740
but in that case you'd be grateful that
you separated them at least to get each

1720
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:23,620
other's point of view,
to know kind of what's a little bit more

1721
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:25,870
what's going on.
Apparently that's like a huge issue.

1722
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:28,270
Like apparently sex trafficking,
you know,

1723
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,640
everybody's just bringing young women in
here to,

1724
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:32,880
you know,
from other places for sex and I don't,

1725
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:35,500
I don't see that much of it,
but apparently it's the biggest thing in

1726
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:36,370
the world,
you know,

1727
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,540
or it was last month.

1728
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:40,120
Well,
there was something that was,

1729
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:41,620
I don't know,
this is true either.

1730
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,450
I'm giving Jamie a lot of work today.
Um,

1731
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,120
there was a smart though,
right?

1732
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,710
Um,
sex trafficking ring that was broken up

1733
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:55,740
by ice and outside of it these people
were protesting ice because of what I,

1734
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:02,260
they were like saying abolish ice.
But meanwhile ice was like stepping.

1735
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:04,900
They didn't understand that when you're
doing,

1736
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:08,170
what is it?
Emma's immigrations customs enforcement.

1737
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:12,220
Ice stands for.
What they're doing is not just,

1738
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:17,350
they're not just trying to stop people
from crossing over the border there also

1739
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:22,440
busting in this case,
apparently it was a sex trafficking or

1740
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:25,270
human trafficking ring.
I don't know if they were using them as

1741
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:27,580
slaves or if they're using them as sex
slaves.

1742
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:28,241
Well,
that's the thing.

1743
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:30,740
Say if,
say if two truckloads of people coming

1744
01:16:30,741 --> 01:16:31,481
to America,
right.

1745
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:32,410
And one is,
is,

1746
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,281
um,
you know,

1747
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:35,770
adults and children and another as
adults and children,

1748
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,370
right.

1749
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:40,840
And one of them are just actual family
members and one of them are sex,

1750
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:42,540
you know,
adults,

1751
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:46,450
you know,
mean men trying to bring in sex workers.

1752
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,450
We,
that's.

1753
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:48,580
Yeah.
I mean,

1754
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,170
how do you know,
how do you not set,

1755
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:50,710
you know,
like,

1756
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:51,161
I know,
yeah,

1757
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:53,890
you don't want to take a mother from a
kid or a father from a daughter,

1758
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,950
but it's like,
how do you know what if and what if you

1759
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:57,940
don't,
you know,

1760
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:01,000
I don't know.
That is the problem with people coming

1761
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:02,310
in.
If they're coming in illegally,

1762
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,940
you have no idea who they are,
what they're doing.

1763
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,430
Yeah.
I mean,

1764
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:07,660
that's only one problem.
The other problem is people who are

1765
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:10,280
criminals,
people who are violent

1766
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,500
offenders,
you know,

1767
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,760
people.
There's people that have gone back and

1768
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:16,830
forth multiple times and got busted in
American wind up killing people.

1769
01:17:16,831 --> 01:17:17,960
That's happened many times.

1770
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,280
Yeah.
They had that guy in San Francisco.

1771
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:22,120
I remember that accidentally shot the
uh,

1772
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,970
end up shooting the girl.
But yeah,

1773
01:17:23,971 --> 01:17:24,960
I mean it's,
you know,

1774
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,040
I'm glad.
I mean,

1775
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,840
I,
as much as it's hectic sometimes to

1776
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:30,720
think about it and here about it,
I think it's also,

1777
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:33,610
it's neat to be alive at a time when,
you know,

1778
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:35,070
I'm challenged to think,
you know,

1779
01:17:35,071 --> 01:17:36,270
and I'm challenged to,
uh,

1780
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,820
to,
to feel different ways and to hear

1781
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,980
different voices and opinions about it
honestly.

1782
01:17:40,981 --> 01:17:43,380
Like I feel like we should have more of
a roll call in America.

1783
01:17:43,381 --> 01:17:45,360
Like you have to know who's here before
you can even,

1784
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,280
you know,
like if you're teaching a classroom,

1785
01:17:47,281 --> 01:17:48,990
if you don't know who's in the class,
how can you even,

1786
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,373
you know,
but it's

1787
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,600
what they should do first and foremost
is legalized drugs.

1788
01:17:55,230 --> 01:18:00,230
And the reason being is that they're
getting across from organized crime and

1789
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:05,130
it's building organized crime in Mexico
to a staggering degree.

1790
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:08,160
The drugs are here.
People are selling these drugs,

1791
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,050
period.
They're going to keep selling these

1792
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:11,970
drugs.
You're not going to diminish the amount

1793
01:18:11,971 --> 01:18:14,130
of drugs.
You just not.

1794
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,720
Yeah,
no one's ever been able to do it.

1795
01:18:15,721 --> 01:18:17,460
The drug wars and complete total
failure.

1796
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:19,500
He Cope.
They love coke.

1797
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:24,530
So make coke legal.
You would put a fucking halt to so much

1798
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,320
and if you made coke,
legal people would buy pure coke.

1799
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:32,040
You would it.
Would it be tested and you could give

1800
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,800
people drug education because like
everybody knows.

1801
01:18:34,801 --> 01:18:37,170
Okay,
how many beers can you drink?

1802
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,780
If you drink three beers,
you probably shouldn't drive a car

1803
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,880
unless you're a giant,
you know,

1804
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,310
like three beers.
You're probably over the legal limit.

1805
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:45,410
Azure of Bayer,
right?

1806
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,570
Let's just some seven foot tall
guerrilla type man.

1807
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:53,100
We've got a lot of buy in a regular.
Like if you are a regular guy

1808
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,200
disappears.
You should not drive.

1809
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,950
Right.
So now stop and think like what is the

1810
01:18:58,951 --> 01:19:00,930
level for cocaine?
I don't know.

1811
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:02,310
I don't do it.
I've never done it,

1812
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,220
but I don't know what it is.
Like maybe we should know like you know,

1813
01:19:05,221 --> 01:19:08,190
you can't have three shots of Jack
Daniels and Dr. Okay.

1814
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,720
But what,
what about,

1815
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,040
what about speed?

1816
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,330
I can take two lines of coke.
You should not be talking to people.

1817
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:20,310
Yeah.
Business shouldn't be fucking calling an

1818
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:21,580
architect.
Dude.

1819
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,570
One of my buddies try to put all of his
fingers in his butt one time for you to

1820
01:19:24,571 --> 01:19:26,430
like an eight ball of coke.
How crazy is that?

1821
01:19:26,431 --> 01:19:27,540
Okay,
so good goal,

1822
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:32,600
but a look and it's hard apparently to
do and it's nice to have a name for.

1823
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:35,160
What was that called?
Fingers in your book called something.

1824
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:37,890
It was like called a clapper.
The liberty bell or something.

1825
01:19:37,891 --> 01:19:41,420
Some crazy thing,
but I'm Jamie's googling it.

1826
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:46,470
What is the term when you have all your
fingers in your butt?

1827
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,270
I think that's called gopher hunting.
You have to be like,

1828
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,690
how would you do that?
You'd have to be like lying on your back

1829
01:19:51,691 --> 01:19:53,880
with your legs,
bugs bunny style over your head.

1830
01:19:53,881 --> 01:19:58,530
You have to hook your left and then this
and to be super flexible.

1831
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,900
Pull it off and you're going to.
The crazy part is,

1832
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:03,420
and I've just thought about this a lot,
but I have thought about this for a

1833
01:20:03,421 --> 01:20:05,700
little bit.
You're going to start with your smallest

1834
01:20:05,701 --> 01:20:07,050
fingers and then you're going to be
stuck.

1835
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,010
Those thumbs after

1836
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,120
he going to be trying to get at the.
Yeah.

1837
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,610
That's going to be the hard part.
You're going to rip your asshole.

1838
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:15,300
Well that's the risk.
You take like an old balloon.

1839
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:20,010
And that's why it's so exciting.
I think if there is no,

1840
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:22,350
uh,
there has to be some risk of reward in

1841
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,630
it from us.
Have slender fingers.

1842
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:27,270
Well he was,
I mean look duties on that much cocaine

1843
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:27,721
did.
I'll do.

1844
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:28,810
And you know,
I used to.

1845
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:29,760
That's the thing,
dude.

1846
01:20:29,761 --> 01:20:31,600
I got all fucked up,
you know,

1847
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,660
I used to get cocaine and do it by
myself at home,

1848
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:34,494
you know,
just to,

1849
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:37,200
I don't know,
I wasn't doing that good just to have

1850
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:38,640
some feelings.
And I remember,

1851
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,430
dude,
I would order vests and shit off the

1852
01:20:41,431 --> 01:20:43,710
Internet.
I have kind of vessel all kinds,

1853
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:46,790
like the kinds that we would wear if you
lived in boulder with them.

1854
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:49,420
The downfield ones.
Patagonia.

1855
01:20:49,421 --> 01:20:50,820
Tell him no,
I've done.

1856
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,800
I've gone.
That's a weird look.

1857
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,510
You got the flower shirt with the puffy
vest.

1858
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,540
Very common look.
But it's like,

1859
01:20:57,541 --> 01:20:59,520
what are we doing here?
Well,

1860
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,930
I want to be warm,
but I want a lit,

1861
01:21:00,931 --> 01:21:04,080
a little bit of ventilation in my arm.
Just a little chill,

1862
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,120
just a little bit of warmth around my
body though.

1863
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:07,350
I liked my tour.
Showed to be warm.

1864
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,620
I'm talking old.
I'm talking to all kinds,

1865
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,150
bro.
I wouldn't get the leather.

1866
01:21:12,151 --> 01:21:15,420
I would get the ones with the bead.
I mean I have like A.

1867
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,740
Honestly,
I've probably about 30 vests at home.

1868
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:17,783
Well,
I vest.

1869
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,770
Why was that the thing that you would
order on cocaine?

1870
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,560
It was just something I liked to do.
Belt buckles.

1871
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:25,740
You have any preposterous,
like some of that light up different

1872
01:21:25,741 --> 01:21:26,880
colors and shit.
He like.

1873
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,110
Yeah,
I'm going out with this.

1874
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:31,500
One of my buddies had a belt.
I said Pussy only on it.

1875
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,730
Oh Nice.
Yeah,

1876
01:21:32,731 --> 01:21:35,350
that guy's gay,
but 100 percent gay.

1877
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,330
They'll push you.
What about you fucking go,

1878
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,720
Bro,
you don't want to do what?

1879
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:40,830
I get pushy.
You know,

1880
01:21:40,831 --> 01:21:42,040
what do you do?
I'll show you both.

1881
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:46,810
Take your pants off.
And so it was a blue suit first put on

1882
01:21:46,811 --> 01:21:48,270
it.
Be careful.

1883
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,171
He's like,
yeah,

1884
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:52,110
I've got a lady a tattooed on my ass,
so love it.

1885
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:56,620
Let's push it.
I got vulva tattooed on my back in a,

1886
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:58,470
in old English letters,
bro.

1887
01:21:58,471 --> 01:22:01,380
I love puts you so much.
I had my ass hole turned into a pussy.

1888
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:06,540
Fuck it.
It feels just like the real thing,

1889
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,280
but eight and a half of your fingers in
it,

1890
01:22:08,281 --> 01:22:10,000
bro.
Do you stem cells broke?

1891
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:13,770
I got some new stem cells.
Do I got these new stem cells used on my

1892
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:14,604
ass.
So,

1893
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,740
um,
but uh,

1894
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,310
but that guy,
yeah.

1895
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:19,860
How do you transition?
I don't know,

1896
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,750
but they got Jordan Peterson was super
cool man.

1897
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:25,980
What did you guys talk about when you
listen to any of this stuff before you

1898
01:22:25,981 --> 01:22:26,814
had them on?
Yeah,

1899
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:30,840
I listened to your episode with them
extra from the day before and I listened

1900
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:33,990
to 'em and I'd been listening to his
book.

1901
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,070
So that's where I was.
And I listened to the debate of the munk

1902
01:22:38,071 --> 01:22:40,710
debates of the ones where the guy called
him a bad white man.

1903
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:42,060
I was like,
this so silly,

1904
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:46,740
but I found him to be in this just a.
He just seemed like the pure.

1905
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:49,740
He seemed completely pure and whatever,
you know,

1906
01:22:49,741 --> 01:22:51,750
he believed,
I think that in helping people,

1907
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:53,280
like,
because I talked to him about like did

1908
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:54,930
he start to feel like famous,
you know,

1909
01:22:54,931 --> 01:22:59,931
like because people are really
gravitating towards and he just felt it

1910
01:23:01,051 --> 01:23:04,590
genuinely seemed that he felt just good
for people.

1911
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,040
He Won.
He was happy

1912
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:10,660
to be helping others and that like,
it didn't seem like he had any ego in

1913
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,830
it.
He,

1914
01:23:11,831 --> 01:23:15,010
um,
he definitely does like to help people,

1915
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:18,670
but he also feels a responsibility
because of his knowledge to explain what

1916
01:23:18,671 --> 01:23:21,440
he thinks is a problem with certain
types of behavior,

1917
01:23:21,441 --> 01:23:25,390
certain laws and one of them that got
them in trouble or got him

1918
01:23:25,391 --> 01:23:29,440
controversial,
got a lot of controversy attached to it

1919
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:32,500
was the compelled speech laws for
transgender people.

1920
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:36,340
The use of a compelled pronouns,
meaning Canada.

1921
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,620
Yeah.
So if you decided that you weren't going

1922
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:41,950
to be a he or a she,
you could make up a number of different

1923
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:44,980
names and they would be legally
compelled to use those names.

1924
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,440
And some people are arguing that's not
what it says.

1925
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,490
And then he was saying,
no,

1926
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:51,100
it's a,
it's a human rights violation if you

1927
01:23:51,101 --> 01:23:53,680
don't follow along with that,
like this is,

1928
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,740
this is compelled speech and this is
dangerous because this is why this is

1929
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:57,574
what it leads to.

1930
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,950
And then there's all these people are
debating with them.

1931
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:01,540
But then when you got a chance to see
his,

1932
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:04,780
with him debating these points with
these various intellectuals,

1933
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,030
including like gender studies,
teachers and Shit,

1934
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:09,280
you got to see like,
oh this,

1935
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:13,390
this is a crazy idea.
Like these,

1936
01:24:13,391 --> 01:24:17,260
these people that think that you should
have like 78 different gender pronouns.

1937
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:20,920
And then it's,
it's tantamount to violence to not use

1938
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:22,450
someone's preferred pronoun.
And you're like,

1939
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,440
oh,
oh,

1940
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:26,410
you're crazy.
Oh this is a mad person who wants the

1941
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:29,830
world to be different.
So you want all these new laws attached

1942
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:34,150
to whether or not someone calls them and
he or she and they're getting some

1943
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:37,810
traction with it.
What is weird in New York,

1944
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,230
New York City,
I think it's the landlords and it might

1945
01:24:41,231 --> 01:24:43,450
be employers my,
but I think I'm pretty sure it's

1946
01:24:43,451 --> 01:24:46,900
landlords.
They are compelled to use your preferred

1947
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:51,220
pronoun,
so if your landlord decides to call you

1948
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,680
a different thing,
like if you say a machine now,

1949
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:55,870
and he's like,
fuck you knew you when you were theo,

1950
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:56,740
Theo.

1951
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,430
See what that law is.
Uh,

1952
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:01,450
uh,
compelled gender pronouns,

1953
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:03,160
law,
New York City.

1954
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:04,750
But,
but people are like,

1955
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:05,561
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

1956
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:09,100
how many do I have to know?
Which ones do I have to agree with you

1957
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:10,630
start?
Because there's a ton of them.

1958
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,780
Now they're literate is 78 different
gender pronouns.

1959
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:15,730
You know what I'm fine like,
I know they would,

1960
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:16,241
uh,
you know,

1961
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:18,850
for awhile it was like,
people in certain areas they don't want

1962
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:22,030
to build transgender bathrooms.
It's like because there's nine people in

1963
01:25:22,031 --> 01:25:24,940
this town and we've seen everybody's
Dick,

1964
01:25:24,941 --> 01:25:25,571
like,
nobody.

1965
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:28,630
We don't have any.
You can't change all these zoning laws

1966
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:31,810
for peak,
for when there's not even someone

1967
01:25:31,811 --> 01:25:36,670
present in some of these areas.
I think in some bad ways they're making

1968
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:41,671
people not be accepting of transgender
people that they may meet at some point

1969
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:45,410
by creating all of this,
this,

1970
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:47,890
this,
this rhetoric or whatever it is,

1971
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:49,060
this,
this conversation.

1972
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:53,080
It's like some people are already fed up
and they've never even met someone like

1973
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:55,540
this and so then they're going to have
weird.

1974
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,110
They're going to have already like
contentious views when they do meet

1975
01:25:59,111 --> 01:26:01,540
someone just because they've heard so
much background noise that it's

1976
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,440
problematic.
You know when not.

1977
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:04,340
That's certainly

1978
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,130
possible.
It's also possible that people will be

1979
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:12,131
scared of the backlash so they won't use
transphobic language anymore.

1980
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:17,330
The problem with that is you're not
encouraging empathy.

1981
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:22,340
You're encouraging fear.
You're encouraging fear of not following

1982
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:27,400
the standard line of behavior and speech
and that's where people have a problem

1983
01:26:27,411 --> 01:26:29,360
with it.
It's like the real way to do it is to

1984
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:31,160
promote empathy,
to say like,

1985
01:26:31,161 --> 01:26:32,570
look,
these people like this,

1986
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:36,320
guys born in the wrong body became a
woman who went through the surgery,

1987
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:38,480
let him use the women's room like why
not?

1988
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:41,720
And if they're a bad person,
judged that bad person on each

1989
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:43,940
individual basis.
Now when you're talking about children,

1990
01:26:43,941 --> 01:26:46,700
that's what people are scared of,
that you know you're going to have some

1991
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:50,270
creep who pretends he's a woman so he
can get in the girls room and he's gonna

1992
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,670
molest children.
Like those are those worst case

1993
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:53,210
scenarios.

1994
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:56,060
Yeah,
those are terrible worst case scenarios,

1995
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:59,180
but what?
How often is that going to happen?

1996
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,720
How do we protect that?
How do we prevent that from happening?

1997
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:06,830
Those are the questions,
but what for the vast majority of the

1998
01:27:06,831 --> 01:27:10,010
people that become trans,
do you really think that they're going

1999
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:11,330
to molest people?
I don't think they are.

2000
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:14,360
You can't judge the vast majority based
on a few.

2001
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:19,250
That's just like the same logic that
says people shoot up people with guns,

2002
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:22,250
so we should take everyone's guns away.
That's crazy to know.

2003
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:24,680
The vast majority of people with guns
don't shoot people.

2004
01:27:24,681 --> 01:27:27,620
The vast majority of people were trans.
They don't want to hurt anybody.

2005
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:30,920
Then that's all they're trying to do is
just get along and be who they are.

2006
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:34,030
This is a complex subject.
At the end,

2007
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:39,060
the danger is when people are scared,
they're scared or bullied into agreeing

2008
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:44,300
with one side of the other side because
then then shit gets weird because then

2009
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:48,950
it becomes a battle but becomes a battle
instead of an opportunity.

2010
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:50,690
Yeah.
Discussion and opportunity to.

2011
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:54,530
To enforce and encourage compassion like
that.

2012
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,370
It can be done both ways.
Yeah.

2013
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:58,590
I think the opera,
but to look at these people like,

2014
01:27:58,610 --> 01:27:59,900
look,
they just hook.

2015
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,610
Why do you care if someone wants to be a
girl?

2016
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,260
Why do you care if she wants to be a
guy?

2017
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:05,210
Why do you care?
Like let them do it.

2018
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,060
Let them be free.
Let them be there themselves.

2019
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:12,560
Just like let it do tattoo his face.
Let let what do whatever you want,

2020
01:28:12,561 --> 01:28:14,930
man.
As long as you're not fucking people

2021
01:28:14,931 --> 01:28:18,080
over and you're not hurting people,
you know out there robbing people and

2022
01:28:18,081 --> 01:28:20,030
stealing from people and murdering
people.

2023
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,880
As long as that's not happening.
Do whatever you want.

2024
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:26,780
What should be our approach?
This stuff that should be one of our.

2025
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:28,790
That should be someone in the bill of
rights or something or a new what?

2026
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:31,850
New.
A new amendment should be something in

2027
01:28:31,851 --> 01:28:34,970
there where we think about the why,
why,

2028
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,670
why we have a problem,
and how we address the problem.

2029
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,440
As soon as you address the problem of
force,

2030
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:43,280
force forward is forced in return,
you're going to get forced back.

2031
01:28:43,281 --> 01:28:45,560
People are going to get,
they're going to want to get ramped up

2032
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:49,070
just as much to attack you is.
You attack them and then you going back

2033
01:28:49,071 --> 01:28:51,170
and forth left and right and it becomes
fucking chaos.

2034
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:54,200
And that's what we have right now.
When you see the difference between Fox

2035
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:58,340
News and CNN and the right and the left
and everybody digs their heels in bad.

2036
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:59,323
Fuck,
it's,

2037
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,220
it's not,
it's not helpful.

2038
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,970
It's not helpful.
And there's also a bunch of people that

2039
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:05,130
profit off of this,
this battle and dispute.

2040
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:08,100
Okay?
No New York City did not just introduce

2041
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:09,110
it,
$250,000,

2042
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:11,070
fine for any incorrect use of gender
pronouns,

2043
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,380
but they did for some use of gender
pronouns.

2044
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:14,790
I think the question

2045
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,780
misinterpretation of a guideline that's
already existed,

2046
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:21,930
uh,
there was a blog post that got written

2047
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:25,800
in the New York Post reported on it.
There was an updated or a change in the

2048
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:28,140
guidelines,
but it's not supposed to be for like an

2049
01:29:28,141 --> 01:29:31,650
incorrect or ms dot misuse of it.
What is it supposed to be for harassment

2050
01:29:31,651 --> 01:29:33,270
and discrimination and things like that.

2051
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:36,420
Okay.
So regardless of individual sex assigned

2052
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:37,650
at birth anatomy,
gender,

2053
01:29:37,651 --> 01:29:41,310
medical history,
appearance or the sex indicated on the

2054
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:44,610
individual's identification.
Okay.

2055
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:50,150
The raw requires employers and covered
entities to use an individual's

2056
01:29:50,971 --> 01:29:53,730
preferred name,
Pronoun and title,

2057
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:56,580
Eg,
Mrs. Or Mrs. Regardless of the

2058
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:59,420
individual sex assigned at birth.
So that's it.

2059
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,950
Okay.
These guidelines as noted by the

2060
01:30:01,951 --> 01:30:06,480
commission can impose penalties of up to
$250,000 for violations that are the

2061
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:10,020
result of willful,
wanton or malicious conduct.

2062
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:13,260
So that seems like they're saying that
it is true.

2063
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:16,200
There are.
That is.

2064
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,540
So there is a law,
but there's a commission.

2065
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:21,000
It's not just like you can't just say it
and someone's going to find you.

2066
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:24,000
It has to go through a long,
lengthy court process and they're not

2067
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,660
just finding people like businesses and
like.

2068
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,970
Exactly.
I get it still slippery.

2069
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:33,250
This is all going to.
Can you imagine the GE?

2070
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:35,880
All this is going to do is create a ton
of lawsuits.

2071
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,490
Yeah.
Just because it's a commission like that

2072
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:41,040
that might even be worse that you're
bringing it into.

2073
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:44,610
Like you have to sit in front of a bunch
of experts who have to decide whether or

2074
01:30:44,611 --> 01:30:46,590
not you.
You missed gendered.

2075
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:48,630
Someone stop.
Like,

2076
01:30:48,631 --> 01:30:50,780
it's crazy.
It's crazy to miss.

2077
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:53,300
Just look,
if someone's an asshole,

2078
01:30:53,301 --> 01:30:54,420
you're an asshole.
Like what if,

2079
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:57,090
what if you're a Jew and someone calls
you a Kike?

2080
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:00,210
Can they get fined $250,000.
How does that work?

2081
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:01,561
Well,
no.

2082
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:03,870
Right,
but that's an offensive term for a

2083
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:04,770
Jewish person.
Right.

2084
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:07,950
So if you,
if you brought that to court,

2085
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:10,570
how would that work?
I don't think you'd get people.

2086
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,370
It's commission though.

2087
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:15,080
Yeah.
That would be like a business being

2088
01:31:15,081 --> 01:31:16,870
brought.
They're not like just a person,

2089
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:17,070
right?

2090
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,210
Yeah,
like landlords.

2091
01:31:18,211 --> 01:31:22,740
It was one of them that they brought up.
Like if you decided that you will be

2092
01:31:22,741 --> 01:31:24,960
Jamie still,
but now you're jamming the woman.

2093
01:31:24,961 --> 01:31:25,950
I'm like,
the fuck Outta here,

2094
01:31:25,951 --> 01:31:27,000
Jamie,
you're a dude.

2095
01:31:27,001 --> 01:31:30,110
GimMe my money,
but it's like a wouldn't date

2096
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:33,910
if that was the case it was and I wanted
an apartment that you were offering and

2097
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:35,770
you wouldn't give me the apartment for
that reason

2098
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:40,130
or we work together in some sort of way
and I'm discriminating against you at

2099
01:31:40,131 --> 01:31:44,300
work.
So it feel like so many.

2100
01:31:44,301 --> 01:31:46,310
It just seems like a ground for so many
lawsuits.

2101
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,190
What I find is if somebody is an addict
to somebody,

2102
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,850
if somebody's calling somebody a name or
something these days with so many camera

2103
01:31:52,851 --> 01:31:56,060
phones and so many things,
usually it gets brought up pretty quick.

2104
01:31:56,150 --> 01:32:00,250
If somebody is racist these days,
like really devout in their core

2105
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:03,670
and they like it gets brought out pretty
fucking quick.

2106
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,740
Not always though.
Not always.

2107
01:32:05,741 --> 01:32:07,660
I'm sure some people get away with it.
Well,

2108
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:10,740
you know how you learn.
You know how I learned like a in the

2109
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:13,600
area I grew up in not to be racist.
You'd hear somebody say something to

2110
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:16,750
somebody else that they shouldn't say
and they got their ass whooped and then

2111
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:17,820
they learn,
not they.

2112
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,740
I mean it was a weird way to learn it,
but you learned,

2113
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:24,220
you learned.
It would be nice if people could learn

2114
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,700
another way to realize how stupid it is
to just be racist.

2115
01:32:27,701 --> 01:32:29,860
Yeah.
There's plenty of ways you should judge

2116
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:33,640
individuals like based on their actions
and what they've done,

2117
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:36,550
how they're treating other people,
how you know whether or not they're

2118
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,700
doing things that are illegal or immoral
or unethical.

2119
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:44,110
That's as an individual,
but as soon as you're doing it based on

2120
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:47,340
where they can't control right there,
what they're,

2121
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,080
what they look like,
where they were born,

2122
01:32:50,081 --> 01:32:51,550
what part of the world they're from.

2123
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,100
That's just fucking stupid.
It's just a stew.

2124
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:55,150
It's you're,
you're,

2125
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,450
you're judging people on something.
I have zero control over.

2126
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,070
You don't have any control of your
color.

2127
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,490
That's crazy and yeah,
there's people that are still doing

2128
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:05,290
that,
that are still living in that space.

2129
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:06,890
Then it's.
I mean,

2130
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:10,120
it is something that I think some of it
will just take more time,

2131
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:12,330
but I think eventually something will be
eradicated it.

2132
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,400
I think it's beige powers my thing.
We're all going to be beige,

2133
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:16,360
Bro.
You know what I'm saying?

2134
01:33:16,361 --> 01:33:19,470
We're three January.
Regeneration from all being based thing.

2135
01:33:19,471 --> 01:33:20,920
So you don't know.
No,

2136
01:33:20,921 --> 01:33:24,760
not because of places like England and
Scotland and Ireland where it's always

2137
01:33:24,761 --> 01:33:26,860
rainy.
You're going to just kinda get a massive

2138
01:33:26,861 --> 01:33:28,930
amount of white people in those spots no
matter what.

2139
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:31,770
There's no sun.
Even White Brown people that moved

2140
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:32,650
there,
five,

2141
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:34,840
six,
seven generations in this type Pale

2142
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:37,210
enough.
Brendan Schaub.

2143
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,020
See he said he was from England.
That's what it.

2144
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:43,980
Is.
It really black dude from Manga?

2145
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:45,910
I don't think he does.
He just forgets things.

2146
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,690
A black guy from England like 500 years
ago,

2147
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,640
his whole fan was probably black and
then over time,

2148
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:54,940
over time they just turned into white
people.

2149
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,160
Just like every other person that moved
to England,

2150
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,620
right?
Every fucking human being came out of

2151
01:33:59,621 --> 01:34:01,000
Africa.
One hundred percent.

2152
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:05,170
That's the origin of the species.
We came from Africa.

2153
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,440
We branched out into the world and we
got to places like Scotland where it

2154
01:34:08,441 --> 01:34:11,080
never fucking never sunny and we got
bleached out.

2155
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:14,290
He believed God,
they turned into like a solar panels for

2156
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:17,830
vitamin D at this to soak up that
vitamin D.

2157
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,360
Yeah,
because if you're black,

2158
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:22,780
like you have so much Melanin,
Congo black,

2159
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:26,350
you got a dark skin color that's just
awesome for sun,

2160
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:29,680
but it's terrible when there's no sun,
like how are you getting your vitamin D

2161
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,270
dot?

2162
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:32,950
Even if you hug a black person,
I feel like your skin feels a little bit

2163
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,990
kind of like more moist.
You know what I'm saying?

2164
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:38,470
They use cocoa butter.
Remember ashy Larry?

2165
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,090
Oh Dude.
We had to do in our neighborhood.

2166
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,690
His brothers set him on fire and his
whole leg was asked.

2167
01:34:42,691 --> 01:34:45,090
She just do booboo.
Tyson and he is.

2168
01:34:45,091 --> 01:34:49,610
Same thing.
It's different kind of ashy along.

2169
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:51,130
Oh yeah,
she's just dry skin,

2170
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,680
but sometimes I feel a little bit of
African like in my course and I was a

2171
01:34:53,681 --> 01:34:56,270
lay in bed at night and just pretend I
was in Africa.

2172
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:58,100
She ever get your blood tested

2173
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,390
to see what you are.
Yeah.

2174
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:01,960
I didn't look at the results yet.
We didn't look at the results and it

2175
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:03,800
scared.
I'm.

2176
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,890
Maybe I'm a little bit nervous,
but what you might be.

2177
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,070
I don't want to be French.
That's what I don't want to be honest

2178
01:35:09,071 --> 01:35:12,080
with you.
I think your French French a little bit.

2179
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,760
Yeah.
I think you've got 13 percent.

2180
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:16,880
Don't laugh about that.
Jamie.

2181
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,120
How come you don't want to be French?
I've all things.

2182
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:21,740
What's wrong with that?
Why would that bother you?

2183
01:35:21,741 --> 01:35:25,100
Even a little bit.
Just they made great wine,

2184
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:28,580
great painters who crave wine.
They complain a lot.

2185
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:30,720
Apparently they liked to fuck.
Really?

2186
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:34,550
That's the word that French people just
like to fuck and they think that the way

2187
01:35:34,551 --> 01:35:39,410
we handle things is stupid.
They have affairs like openly,

2188
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:41,610
publicly,
the French,

2189
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,460
a little bit.
Politicians,

2190
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:44,720
they of course they cheat.

2191
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,830
They're all fucking animals over there.
It just drew and that toxo plasma

2192
01:35:48,831 --> 01:35:51,860
apparently was running rapid through
France.

2193
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,350
Really?
Is it toxo plasma is that thing that you

2194
01:35:55,351 --> 01:36:00,020
get from cats?
Get it and they get it from rats and

2195
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:02,960
it's a,
it's a parasite that gets into human

2196
01:36:02,961 --> 01:36:06,620
brains and it affects humans and it
makes people a little bit more reckless.

2197
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:08,450
Like rabies kind of a light.
No,

2198
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,130
not rabies.
More like a,

2199
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,910
like slightly drunk all the time.
And uh,

2200
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:17,420
this toxo plasma.
Apparently there was one point in time

2201
01:36:17,421 --> 01:36:22,421
40 percent of the franchise of France
was infected with toxo plasma.

2202
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,960
Yeah.
See if you find that that's true.

2203
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:26,600
It must have been a fuck fest.
I Beth fuck fest.

2204
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:28,070
Wild and loose.
Yeah.

2205
01:36:28,071 --> 01:36:31,220
You Got to pee.
They think that there's a direct

2206
01:36:31,221 --> 01:36:35,870
correlation between the high levels of
infestation and the behavioral changes

2207
01:36:35,871 --> 01:36:37,620
that the population in Pensacola,
what?

2208
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:38,540
Rats and stuff.
No,

2209
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:42,200
of this talkshow plastic suppliers and
probably 50 million people in this

2210
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:45,770
country have it.
You get it from cat shit or from if you

2211
01:36:45,771 --> 01:36:48,470
live in a farm,
like you step on the field and it gets

2212
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:51,350
in your skin.
Like maybe cats had been shitting all

2213
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:54,520
over the place,
or a dog will eat something that you

2214
01:36:54,521 --> 01:36:55,520
know,
some cat shit,

2215
01:36:55,521 --> 01:36:57,170
wouldn't you get shit and you're around
the dog.

2216
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:01,400
Two thousand 12 analysis from France are
an estimated 43 percent of the people

2217
01:37:01,401 --> 01:37:06,401
carrying toxoplasmosis.
Gandhi concluded that men with a latent

2218
01:37:07,101 --> 01:37:11,000
infection tend to be more dogmatic,
less confident,

2219
01:37:11,001 --> 01:37:13,070
more jealous,
less impulsive,

2220
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:17,840
and more orderly than infected men.
Infected women seem warmer,

2221
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:20,810
more conscientious,
more persistent,

2222
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:23,870
more insecure,
and more sanctimonious.

2223
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:24,940
Whoa,
dude.

2224
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:26,900
I'll get a six pack for the ladies then.
Huh?

2225
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:31,340
That sounds crazy.
Is that that 43 percent of people carry

2226
01:37:31,341 --> 01:37:32,930
it?
Jesus Christ.

2227
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:37,730
That's a large number of human beings
infected by something that changes

2228
01:37:37,731 --> 01:37:42,731
behavior or at least leads to trends
that are different and and noticeable.

2229
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:45,380
More dogmatic,
less confident,

2230
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:47,720
less confident is interesting that gone
die.

2231
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:53,170
Toxoplasmosis gone die.
Associations of having antibodies to the

2232
01:37:53,511 --> 01:37:56,400
parasite with bipolar,
suicidal

2233
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,250
behavior,
even optimistic disposition,

2234
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:02,430
possibly related to the parasites effect
on dopamine.

2235
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,600
So it gets into your body and then you
just have it for life.

2236
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,650
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

2237
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,240
it is sexually transmitted.
It must be.

2238
01:38:09,241 --> 01:38:11,340
Then that's a good question.
That's a very good question.

2239
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:13,290
I don't know if 43 percent of people
have it.

2240
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:16,200
I can't imagine that half of the
population to stepped on a,

2241
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:17,940
you know,
fucking.

2242
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,190
Well,
I think that's a good question.

2243
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,530
That's a good question.
But I think there's a lot of feral cats

2244
01:38:22,531 --> 01:38:23,430
around.
Yeah.

2245
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:24,303
Oh,
that's true.

2246
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:26,580
Yeah.
I think when there's places like El

2247
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:26,920
Gato.
Yeah.

2248
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,170
We got a lot of feral cats running
around gratitude.

2249
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:30,660
They have that whole movie.
But that animal,

2250
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,160
that was a chef.
Yup.

2251
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:35,700
And what it does to the rats is that
makes them get hard ons when they smell

2252
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,650
cat piss.
Is that really?

2253
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:40,320
Yup.
It rewires their sexual reward system.

2254
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:43,980
So the testes in large,
when they smell cat piss.

2255
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:45,570
No,
they get hard.

2256
01:38:45,571 --> 01:38:47,670
So it gets at a fucking.
A neighbor like that dated.

2257
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:50,100
This guy will always with pregnancy.
Say that again.

2258
01:38:50,101 --> 01:38:52,020
It gets them through pregnancy to the
child.

2259
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:54,080
Woof,
woof.

2260
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:58,220
There you go.
Know 43 percent is a high number.

2261
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:01,320
That's like,
it's a lot of people.

2262
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:04,920
It's 43 out of 100 people do 3 billion
people on the planet.

2263
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:09,330
Two billion people have it as 43 percent
of those tested in that study and that's

2264
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:11,640
all the people that get tested.
Who the fuck I've never been tested.

2265
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:12,900
You've been tested?
No.

2266
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,200
How many of you have been tested?
That's a rough estimate,

2267
01:39:16,201 --> 01:39:17,310
man.
They don't fucking know.

2268
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:18,900
I bet it's a lot higher.
I bet.

2269
01:39:18,901 --> 01:39:21,930
As a lot of people that have it.
Yeah.

2270
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,100
Shit in the blood,
dude.

2271
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:26,490
I probably got it.
We had a Dr Robert Sapolsky and the

2272
01:39:26,491 --> 01:39:27,840
podcast.
We did one with him.

2273
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:32,160
He's an expert in it and he's got a
bunch of lectures and speeches on it and

2274
01:39:32,161 --> 01:39:37,161
he said that when he was a resident then
he heard about a guy who found out that

2275
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:43,170
a disproportionate number of motorcycle
accidents were attributed to people that

2276
01:39:43,171 --> 01:39:45,150
were on this toxo plasma.
Really?

2277
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:45,871
Yeah.
That they.

2278
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:49,950
That they got this infection and it was
causing them to do stupid shit on

2279
01:39:49,951 --> 01:39:52,770
motorcycles and crash.
I would hate that man.

2280
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:55,070
It's hard enough to ride a motorcycle
and then they have like,

2281
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:58,680
you know,
just to be being led astray by rare

2282
01:39:58,681 --> 01:40:02,100
disease in your brain one.
And I wonder if it varies.

2283
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:04,020
Right?
I wonder if the Toxoplasma that they get

2284
01:40:04,021 --> 01:40:08,110
in Paris has the same exact response was
the one that they get in South America.

2285
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,190
The America.
That is a bunch of variations.

2286
01:40:11,191 --> 01:40:11,671
Yeah.
Oh,

2287
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:13,080
see,
that's what I'm talking about.

2288
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:17,550
There's different ones.
A Long Island has a lot of Jesus Christ.

2289
01:40:17,551 --> 01:40:21,090
There's different ones.
Fuck,

2290
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:21,983
see,
I bet the.

2291
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:24,270
What is this though?
This seemed like.

2292
01:40:24,271 --> 01:40:26,280
What is it?
Well,

2293
01:40:26,281 --> 01:40:28,800
it's parasites.
Parasites,

2294
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:34,190
parasites exist in so many animals.
They hitch rides and then that's their

2295
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:37,200
ecosystem.
Our ecosystem is to be on planet earth.

2296
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:41,580
Their ecosystem is to be in planet feel
Vaughn and they just get inside of you.

2297
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,250
Have parasites ever changed?
Like the kind of the course of history?

2298
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:46,230
Is that what happened with the plague or
is that a different thing?

2299
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:47,970
No,
the plagues a different thing,

2300
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:50,310
but they probably could change the
course of history.

2301
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:52,230
Have they really changed that many
people's behavior?

2302
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:56,860
If you think about Paris or France,
they're talking about 43 percent of the

2303
01:40:56,861 --> 01:40:59,500
people have this infection and the irony
of parasites.

2304
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,360
How crazy is that?
That's crazy.

2305
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:05,500
It's Paris site.
What if they have.

2306
01:41:05,501 --> 01:41:08,640
Could you imagine a little French
fucking berets?

2307
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:12,430
We Lee.
I'm going to change your behavior a

2308
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,440
little.
You'll go to stupid American.

2309
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:18,130
The craziest one man is this aquatic
worm.

2310
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:23,140
It climbs inside of grasshoppers.
Body grows and the grasshoppers body,

2311
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:26,410
and then it tells the grasshopper to
commit suicide.

2312
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:29,320
Oh my God.
So it gets the grasshopper to jump into

2313
01:41:29,321 --> 01:41:31,600
the water and then once the grasshopper
gets in the water,

2314
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:33,620
then it bursts out of its body.
Oh,

2315
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,070
it's like Pinocchio meets.
I'm alien.

2316
01:41:36,071 --> 01:41:37,570
Have you seen the movie alien?
Sigourney weaver.

2317
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:42,430
It is like Pinocchio.
It's like the bottom of the whale,

2318
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:44,800
right in the belly of the whale.
Yeah.

2319
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:48,760
That movie alien with Sigourney Weaver.
Probably my favorite science fiction

2320
01:41:48,761 --> 01:41:50,050
movie of all time.
Oh really?

2321
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:53,020
Yeah.
I would say if I had to pick one science

2322
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:55,840
fiction horror movie that was like the
one.

2323
01:41:56,170 --> 01:41:58,510
I'll say that alien.
It's kind of cornball.

2324
01:41:58,511 --> 01:42:00,130
When you watched the special effects now
though?

2325
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:02,650
Yeah.
Not as scary.

2326
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:04,970
Yeah.
There's some space stuff that you like,

2327
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:06,191
oh,
okay.

2328
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:10,060
This is 1978.
Forget different times and even 1980

2329
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:11,230
man,
you know,

2330
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:12,970
it's a corny.
That's crazy.

2331
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:16,930
Hot hades or being tall and she had
curly hair.

2332
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:19,630
I remember thinking I'm strong.
Confident.

2333
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:20,620
Sexy.
Yes.

2334
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:24,580
You were fucking neck like you think you
couldn't choke her out?

2335
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:25,570
Yeah.
Like if she was.

2336
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:28,330
She was such a powerful woman.
Like this isn't a woman that needs a

2337
01:42:28,331 --> 01:42:30,160
man.
She liked you.

2338
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:30,881
It's like,
oh.

2339
01:42:30,881 --> 01:42:32,200
She's like,
I'm worthy.

2340
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,450
I'm worthy of her.
Like she drove a van,

2341
01:42:34,451 --> 01:42:36,100
but because she had fucking business to
do.

2342
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:38,770
Yeah.
I think we should have like an old land

2343
01:42:38,771 --> 01:42:40,120
cruiser.
Look at Toyota.

2344
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:42,600
FJ 41 of those ones.
Yeah.

2345
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,710
She'd be like an archeologist or some
shit,

2346
01:42:44,711 --> 01:42:44,860
right?

2347
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:46,690
Yeah.
She had a fucking pickax and what?

2348
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:49,350
She was in Avatar.
Right in.

2349
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:50,460
What is this?
Oh,

2350
01:42:50,461 --> 01:42:52,060
that's the alien.
Took it that.

2351
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:53,870
That's too.
Is that a raccoon?

2352
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,120
What does that.
So it's a kid.

2353
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:57,310
This little kid hanging onto her bro.
I love that.

2354
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:01,000
That was alien.
Alien Two's not my favorite because it

2355
01:43:01,001 --> 01:43:01,930
was like,
wait a minute,

2356
01:43:01,931 --> 01:43:03,610
why is it so easy to kill them all of a
sudden,

2357
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,070
so easy to kill them because there's so
many of them.

2358
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:08,920
Like alien one.
That fucking thing was like it was

2359
01:43:08,921 --> 01:43:10,750
thinking it was.
It was.

2360
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:13,270
It was ahead of you every step of the
way.

2361
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:16,120
Alien too.
They just became like clumsy and

2362
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:19,690
bumbling and shoot them and then there's
another one around the corner.

2363
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:20,800
Shoot that one too.
It's like,

2364
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,250
okay.
Did I remember a Arachnophobia had me

2365
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:26,150
shook.
Remember that one when the spider has

2366
01:43:26,151 --> 01:43:29,800
gotten that duplex,
brother shook me to the core to see this

2367
01:43:29,801 --> 01:43:32,200
one is like way deep into the future.

2368
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:37,290
Like the first one was in the seventies,
[inaudible] and they're still doing them

2369
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:38,630
now.
That's what's crazy.

2370
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:42,040
To ready to bang out new alien movies.
Now the Predator coming out,

2371
01:43:42,490 --> 01:43:45,100
they'd have a new Predator coming up.
They do hilarious.

2372
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:47,450
Why not make some money?
Yeah,

2373
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,060
that's true.
That kind of stuff is fun.

2374
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:51,170
It's probably fun.
I can't believe Brennan.

2375
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:52,250
Siobhan,
Italian.

2376
01:43:52,251 --> 01:43:55,130
Would you say it was British English?
Yeah.

2377
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:55,971
Hmm.
Yeah.

2378
01:43:55,971 --> 01:43:59,060
That came from Africa through England a
thousand years ago.

2379
01:43:59,061 --> 01:44:00,220
His people did.
Oh,

2380
01:44:00,221 --> 01:44:01,430
I know.
Over time.

2381
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:04,280
White.
That's why they call him big brown.

2382
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:05,700
Oh really?
No.

2383
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:07,130
Just made all that.
Oh Dang.

2384
01:44:07,131 --> 01:44:11,750
I was going on here.
I thought he seemed like he seemed

2385
01:44:11,751 --> 01:44:14,630
pretty white to me when I see a giant
white dude.

2386
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:16,080
Yeah.
He loved.

2387
01:44:16,081 --> 01:44:18,420
He always has.
He as the best disposition doesn't

2388
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:20,360
break.
He just loves to laugh.

2389
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,130
Do you can take it out on.

2390
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:23,630
He just hated on dudes.
Get Jealous.

2391
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:25,700
Do you ever get jealous?
But do you think.

2392
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:30,730
And also he says stupid shit sometimes,
but do you think he feels that he.

2393
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:33,140
I feel like he has a special gift where
you can kind of,

2394
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,870
especially if you're a buddy,
like you can kind of joke with him and

2395
01:44:35,871 --> 01:44:37,390
he loved,
like he just,

2396
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:40,910
he knows that you love him.
You know he's a great guy.

2397
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:43,100
He brushes it off.
He's got a great attitude.

2398
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:46,250
Like if more people had his attitude
about dealing with life's problems,

2399
01:44:46,610 --> 01:44:49,760
we'd have a happier world.
He knows how to let things roll right

2400
01:44:49,761 --> 01:44:51,380
off his back.
He's big.

2401
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:52,520
He's a smart guy,
man.

2402
01:44:52,521 --> 01:44:55,520
I always like being around him.
Yeah,

2403
01:44:55,521 --> 01:44:57,110
man.
He gets a lot of hate online.

2404
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:58,360
It's interesting.
Yeah,

2405
01:44:58,361 --> 01:44:59,870
I think it,
but I think as guys that are jealous

2406
01:44:59,871 --> 01:45:02,060
because when I go on the road like I
just went to Bakersfield recently,

2407
01:45:02,061 --> 01:45:02,840
which is.

2408
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:05,780
Can we just say it's like the best
people ever came out there.

2409
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:10,130
Feels fucking amazing.
I felt like I felt like hulk Hogan Bro.

2410
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,230
People came out.
People were crying,

2411
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:13,890
someone's sacrifice,
their cousins.

2412
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:17,810
Some guy came out of the closet like all
they wanted it all to happen at the

2413
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:18,770
show.
You know?

2414
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:21,890
People were giving me recipes.
People were donating blood thing.

2415
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:23,120
Man,
it ain't that far.

2416
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:26,060
It's an hour and a half hour and 40
minutes.

2417
01:45:26,061 --> 01:45:29,090
How long does it take to get to
Bakersfield from ela?

2418
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:30,470
Two hours.
Two hours Max.

2419
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:31,790
It should be the new capital,
Bro.

2420
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:36,080
It's not a bad spot.
And the people are Super Nice.

2421
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:38,150
Pretty diverse.
I mean,

2422
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:39,051
yeah,
it was cool,

2423
01:45:39,051 --> 01:45:40,100
man.
I really liked it.

2424
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:42,320
Although I did turn my sink on.
It's Brown.

2425
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:44,360
Shit was fucking flying out of the sink.
I was like,

2426
01:45:44,361 --> 01:45:48,650
what the fuck is this?
I've made an instagram video of it.

2427
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:50,450
I was like,
Bakersfield,

2428
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:52,910
what the fuck is going on with your
water man?

2429
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:56,300
To say good,
because you know their high school,

2430
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:59,420
their mascot.
It's called the drillers.

2431
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:02,000
The team name because they're oil
drillers.

2432
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:06,060
Do you know that that whole area is
where there will be blood that no.

2433
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:07,910
Daniel Day,
Lewis Lewis movie.

2434
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,840
I love that guy.
That's an amazing movie too.

2435
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:13,220
So good that there will be blood is
about that whole area.

2436
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,180
That's where there's apparently.
Look at that.

2437
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:18,740
Is My water coming out of my fucking
sick.

2438
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,330
Did you drink any?
Oh yeah,

2439
01:46:20,331 --> 01:46:21,164
dude.

2440
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:32,180
Crazy noises out brown water
and the word says you already brushed

2441
01:46:36,981 --> 01:46:38,360
your teeth.
That's the crazy part too.

2442
01:46:38,361 --> 01:46:40,340
I hate when that happens because you
don't know it first.

2443
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:42,130
Ooh,
it's funky.

2444
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:46,160
Definitely seems like a malt,
but I think that I was staying at our

2445
01:46:46,161 --> 01:46:50,850
super old hotel,
like real from the 18 hundreds.

2446
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:53,280
They like redid it downtown.
Yeah.

2447
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:55,290
What is it called?
I think it might have stayed at the ace

2448
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:57,780
hotel,
the NSA Godrej.

2449
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:00,750
I didn't tell people where I stood
because I didn't want to be mean to the

2450
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:02,550
hotel.
The Padre hotel.

2451
01:47:02,551 --> 01:47:04,580
I think of this as the old place.
Yes.

2452
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,000
I think that's it.
I think it was nice.

2453
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:07,710
Had a nice.
It was nice in there.

2454
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,430
It was nice restaurant.
Elevator.

2455
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:10,081
Yeah.
Yeah,

2456
01:47:10,081 --> 01:47:12,690
but it's just.
They got some old ass pipes.

2457
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:16,260
Clean those pipes on.
Something is going wrong and I was

2458
01:47:16,261 --> 01:47:16,710
staying there.

2459
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:20,820
So what if.
What if I took a mouthful that drank it?

2460
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:24,090
What did he died?
What if I was just shitting all over

2461
01:47:24,091 --> 01:47:26,370
myself for the rest of the day and I had
to cancel my shows.

2462
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:28,170
Oh,
how about that?

2463
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:30,000
People would be furious.
Angry.

2464
01:47:30,001 --> 01:47:31,740
Rightly so.
They shouldn't be furious.

2465
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:33,560
Do.
Do you think you'll die one day or not?

2466
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:34,960
I'm not trying to make you think about
it.

2467
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,060
I'm pretty sure that's how the world.
That's how the road goes.

2468
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:41,100
Yeah.
You're born and then you die.

2469
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:42,343
What?
What do you think?

2470
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:44,520
Don't know man.
Crush it.

2471
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:45,990
Doesn't think you die.
Yeah.

2472
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:47,080
Yeah.
I think.

2473
01:47:47,081 --> 01:47:48,730
I think he's just drunk.
Yeah,

2474
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,850
that could be it too.
You didn't have a shirt on,

2475
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:52,230
dude,
you get to put a shirt on and decide if

2476
01:47:52,231 --> 01:47:52,930
you're going to die or.
No,

2477
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:53,930
he goes,
prove it,

2478
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:57,000
prove it.
Oh boy.

2479
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,710
We have to base this on what we know
about people now.

2480
01:48:01,711 --> 01:48:04,440
I know the people you used to be alive
and now they're not.

2481
01:48:04,441 --> 01:48:07,350
So what happened to them?
Are they faking it?

2482
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:10,260
You know,
like you.

2483
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:11,730
Will you be sad if you die,
you think?

2484
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:13,620
I think I'll be dead,
Bro.

2485
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:16,320
Yeah.
What about you?

2486
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,480
I'd be sad if you died.
Oh,

2487
01:48:18,481 --> 01:48:19,920
thank you.
I'd be sad if you died too.

2488
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,280
Thanks man.
Um,

2489
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:23,940
I would be worried about the end of your
life.

2490
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:27,390
Yeah,
I worry about him in a sense.

2491
01:48:27,391 --> 01:48:29,820
It makes you really wonder then what,
what is my time mean?

2492
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,180
What does your timing like?
What's important to you in this life

2493
01:48:33,181 --> 01:48:35,010
right now?
Um,

2494
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:39,390
I think probably being,
just feeling more okay with myself

2495
01:48:39,391 --> 01:48:43,950
probably and trying to have maybe help
other people being more okay with

2496
01:48:43,951 --> 01:48:44,784
yourself.
Like what?

2497
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:48,010
What bothers you about yourself?
Uh,

2498
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:51,270
I just wish I just felt more comfortable
in my own skin a lot of times,

2499
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:53,820
you know,
because I feel like I'm be able to be

2500
01:48:53,821 --> 01:48:58,821
more effective as a person if I could
just kind of get not toil in some of my

2501
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:01,450
own,
you know,

2502
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:05,490
the small self worth issues or like lack
of confidence at times,

2503
01:49:05,491 --> 01:49:07,050
you know,
I wish I could trust my instincts and I

2504
01:49:07,051 --> 01:49:10,770
wish my instincts were like better
calibrated so that I knew when I was

2505
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:12,870
what if I was doing like,
okay,

2506
01:49:12,871 --> 01:49:15,810
in good stuff,
then my insides like told me,

2507
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:17,100
you're being okay.

2508
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,360
You don't have to worry.
You know,

2509
01:49:18,690 --> 01:49:20,430
there's a lot of things going on there,
right?

2510
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:23,490
One of them,
the big one is almost always from your

2511
01:49:23,491 --> 01:49:28,410
childhood,
almost feelings of lack of worth and

2512
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:32,670
self worth come from that feeling as
you're developing,

2513
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,200
as you're growing up.
Yeah.

2514
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:38,470
Feel like you're not loved or you're not
appreciated or you're,

2515
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:42,090
you're criticized too much.
You feel like you're a loser and really

2516
01:49:42,091 --> 01:49:44,820
be concise.
Psychologically can be very hard to

2517
01:49:44,821 --> 01:49:47,070
shake.
And even as people get older,

2518
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,363
they still,

2519
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:53,220
they still cling to this thought that
they're a piece of shit because they are

2520
01:49:53,221 --> 01:49:56,680
a piece of shit in someone's eyes when
they were eight or 10.

2521
01:49:57,730 --> 01:49:59,260
That's a real problem with people,
man.

2522
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:03,970
And that's one of the reasons why when
someone gets bullied when they're young,

2523
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:08,170
it can be so devastating because it's
happening when you're in high school or

2524
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:11,680
junior high school and it becomes a
defining moment for you.

2525
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:17,080
Yet I was scared as one kid really also
about this one kid,

2526
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:20,440
one of the reasons why I got into
wrestling this kid,

2527
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,930
uh,
like we had this confrontation and a

2528
01:50:22,931 --> 01:50:26,020
locker room and I didn't think were
going to fight.

2529
01:50:26,021 --> 01:50:28,180
Like I was just totally bluffing.
I don't know what,

2530
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:31,060
what I said or what he said,
I don't remember.

2531
01:50:31,061 --> 01:50:32,950
But I do remember him getting me in a
headlock,

2532
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:37,150
throwing me on the ground and then
leaning like he was gonna Punch me in

2533
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:37,690
the face.

2534
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:40,480
But deciding not to and I didn't know
what to do.

2535
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:44,410
I had no,
no martial arts skills.

2536
01:50:44,411 --> 01:50:46,070
No nothing.
I haven't.

2537
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:48,730
I'd never wrestled anybody before.
I didn't know anything,

2538
01:50:48,731 --> 01:50:50,860
so there's nothing in you that is like a
new reaction,

2539
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:54,910
panicked and no idea what to do.
And I think and I thought,

2540
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:57,280
shit,
I didn't think he was going to do that

2541
01:50:57,281 --> 01:50:59,360
and now here I am on my back.
I'm traveling,

2542
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:01,510
God dammit.
I got to learn how to wrestle.

2543
01:51:01,511 --> 01:51:03,040
I got to learn some martial arts or
something.

2544
01:51:03,041 --> 01:51:06,460
So then I started taking karate and then
I started taking wrestling like right

2545
01:51:06,461 --> 01:51:10,780
after that.
But I avoided that kid every time I saw

2546
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:12,550
him.
When I see him on the other side of

2547
01:51:12,551 --> 01:51:14,530
school,
it looks through the breezeway and I've

2548
01:51:14,531 --> 01:51:16,960
always knew where he was around.
I got to go around.

2549
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:20,260
I don't want to see that guy that threw
me on the ground and could have punched

2550
01:51:20,261 --> 01:51:20,800
me in the face.

2551
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,990
It was almost like more humiliating that
he did,

2552
01:51:22,991 --> 01:51:24,550
could have punched me in the face,
but he didn't.

2553
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:28,180
But that bullying and that guy doing
that,

2554
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:32,090
to me,
that fear of like being I'm just

2555
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:34,450
helpless,
made me get into martial arts.

2556
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:35,800
I was like,
fuck this.

2557
01:51:35,801 --> 01:51:38,890
Like I gotta figure out how to fight.
I don't want this to happen to me

2558
01:51:38,891 --> 01:51:43,891
anymore to do you see as the benefit.
It was a lucky situation to look.

2559
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:47,560
He didn't beat me up.
It could've been way worse.

2560
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:50,440
It was not that big a deal.
It was an easy school to go to.

2561
01:51:50,441 --> 01:51:52,900
Like my school wasn't hard.
Even though there was some criminals

2562
01:51:52,901 --> 01:51:55,390
that were in that school,
like some kids that get shipped into.

2563
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:58,210
There was some bad kids and one of them
got charged with murder,

2564
01:51:58,211 --> 01:51:59,670
like right after graduating.
We were like,

2565
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,000
whoa.
Our friend Kevin,

2566
01:52:01,001 --> 01:52:02,560
we knew this dude and he killed
somebody,

2567
01:52:02,561 --> 01:52:03,730
but like,
whoa.

2568
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:05,141
Yeah.
Everybody was like,

2569
01:52:05,141 --> 01:52:06,730
whoa.
That guy killed somebody.

2570
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,530
I think he was one year older than me.
Yeah.

2571
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:11,830
He murdered somebody like right after
high school.

2572
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:13,360
Yeah,
there's a kid.

2573
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:15,850
We knew he was on the football team.
We knew him.

2574
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:18,220
And then do you ever think he would
murder somebody?

2575
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:21,960
He was a tough guy.
He's a scary guy for sure.

2576
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:24,520
Like a powerhouse of a person,
like a tank.

2577
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,590
I didn't know him well though,
but I,

2578
01:52:26,591 --> 01:52:27,610
you know,
I'd say hi to them,

2579
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,780
but it's one of those things where when
something like that happens to you and

2580
01:52:31,781 --> 01:52:33,760
for me again,
it was very minor,

2581
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:37,180
just I was just scared of this guy now
he didn't do anything to me.

2582
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:38,860
Horrible.
Just threw me on the ground.

2583
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:40,750
So when somebody's going to beat your
brains,

2584
01:52:40,751 --> 01:52:42,450
I mean if somebody could hold you down
like that I could do,

2585
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:44,680
could have beat my face and I wouldn't
have been able to do shit.

2586
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:46,970
Are you grateful in a weird way that he
didn't or not grateful?

2587
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:50,270
Looking back on her for sure,
but it was enough.

2588
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:52,040
He just let me know.
I was,

2589
01:52:52,210 --> 01:52:53,240
you know,
I don't know what I said.

2590
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:55,580
I'm in a said something stupid.
He might've said something stupid and

2591
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:58,550
wanted me to back down and I didn't.
So he just grabbed me,

2592
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:00,710
threw me on the ground.
But the fact that he,

2593
01:53:01,070 --> 01:53:06,070
that he did it and could do it led me to
make one of the biggest decisions of my

2594
01:53:06,231 --> 01:53:08,390
whole life is getting involved in
martial arts.

2595
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,190
I just didn't want that feeling anymore
of like if someone talks like gives me a

2596
01:53:13,191 --> 01:53:17,090
hard time,
I want to be the one who can decide

2597
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:19,490
whether or not this gets violent or who
gets hurt.

2598
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:21,740
I don't want to leave that into some
stranger's hand,

2599
01:53:21,741 --> 01:53:24,410
so it might be a fucking psychopath if
it's in my hands.

2600
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:25,850
No one's getting hurt.
We're going to be finally,

2601
01:53:25,851 --> 01:53:28,340
there's a video of Matt Serra from
yesterday.

2602
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,340
Matt Serra,
there was a drunk and altercation with

2603
01:53:31,341 --> 01:53:35,310
some fucking dude in a food court.
Matt Serra who is a Brazilian Jujitsu

2604
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:37,580
black belt,
who at one point in time when he was

2605
01:53:37,581 --> 01:53:39,440
competing,
he was one of the best presented to to

2606
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:41,480
artists in the world.
Then on top of that,

2607
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:43,970
he fought mma,
knocked out George St.

2608
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:48,320
Pierre won the welterweight title and
he's got some dude on the ground and

2609
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:50,540
he's just saying,
calm down,

2610
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:53,560
calm down because I'm gonna fuck you up.
I'm going to fuck.

2611
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,000
But it's hilarious to watch like,
look at this look good,

2612
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,800
play good and play the volume.

2613
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:02,580
He's like,
I'm going to break your fucking face.

2614
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,660
He's holding his wrist.
I love how you have the shirt on the

2615
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:07,680
guy's face.
He's like,

2616
01:54:07,681 --> 01:54:08,910
calm down,
calm down.

2617
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,340
It's like he's putting a crying baby to
sleep,

2618
01:54:11,341 --> 01:54:13,260
and so the security guard comes over and
says,

2619
01:54:13,261 --> 01:54:14,160
let him go.
He goes,

2620
01:54:14,161 --> 01:54:15,440
okay,
you're going to control them.

2621
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:25,690
You going to control them.
Are you going to control knowing that?

2622
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:31,240
Are you ready to control them?
Like he's not standing up and he's fat?

2623
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:42,550
I'll tell

2624
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:43,510
you something.
Mad.

2625
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,350
Sarah's one of the nicest fucking guys
on the planet earth.

2626
01:54:46,410 --> 01:54:50,280
If he has to do this to you in a
restaurant and she's a restaurant,

2627
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:52,830
he's got full mount on you.
You fucked up.

2628
01:54:53,010 --> 01:54:55,020
You fucked up dude.
But see,

2629
01:54:55,021 --> 01:54:57,720
you're way better off with Matt Serra in
that position.

2630
01:54:57,721 --> 01:55:00,690
Then that drunk dude on some guy who
doesn't know how to fight.

2631
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:03,510
It could be that too.
That drunk dude could just be a real

2632
01:55:03,511 --> 01:55:06,300
mean violent person who wants to beat
someone up if he gets him down.

2633
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:08,850
So if there's guys like you who aren't
into that.

2634
01:55:09,210 --> 01:55:12,810
So you found getting into martial arts,
I really kind of lead you in a way where

2635
01:55:12,811 --> 01:55:16,620
you felt more confident in case things
got into an uncomfortable situation that

2636
01:55:16,621 --> 01:55:18,030
you would be okay.
Yeah.

2637
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:19,320
Well look,
you're always.

2638
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:22,530
You're always going to be nervous in
life when something's important,

2639
01:55:22,531 --> 01:55:24,910
whether it's going on stage or something
difficult to do.

2640
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:28,410
Difficult things make you nervous.
It's like there's an anticipation.

2641
01:55:28,411 --> 01:55:32,490
There's an understanding of the
difficulty of something you're about to

2642
01:55:32,491 --> 01:55:34,980
pursue and whether or not you're going
to fall short or whether or not you're

2643
01:55:34,981 --> 01:55:37,290
going to succeed.
That shit makes people nervous,

2644
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:41,910
but the physical confrontation,
nervousness is a bad one.

2645
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,010
That's like dad is

2646
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:48,600
a paralyzing fear when the fear of being
bullied or being hurt and you can't do

2647
01:55:48,601 --> 01:55:50,100
anything about it.
That devastates people,

2648
01:55:50,101 --> 01:55:51,690
that puts them in a deep,
deep depression.

2649
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:57,290
So it's really important to I think.
I think every young man should learn how

2650
01:55:57,871 --> 01:56:00,090
to fight.
I think there would be way less fights

2651
01:56:00,091 --> 01:56:03,750
because of it and I don't think you have
to be a mean person to learn martial

2652
01:56:03,751 --> 01:56:06,030
arts.
I think it's a skill and I think you

2653
01:56:06,031 --> 01:56:08,130
learn it and then once you start getting
good at it,

2654
01:56:08,131 --> 01:56:11,940
it started actually starts actually
becoming fun and the people who practice

2655
01:56:11,941 --> 01:56:14,400
it with you,
you become close with you,

2656
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:16,740
don't.
You don't hate the people that you're

2657
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:20,130
practicing fighting with.
They become some of your closest friends

2658
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:25,230
and I think it's just a big.
It's a giant confidence boost to know

2659
01:56:25,231 --> 01:56:27,660
that you can do something difficult and
get better at it.

2660
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:28,980
That's,
I think,

2661
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:32,310
just that alone.
It has massive benefits for people.

2662
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:33,241
Yeah,
you know,

2663
01:56:33,241 --> 01:56:35,580
I can sense that meant I remember
watching a video a couple years ago

2664
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:37,320
actually if you like getting a belt or
something,

2665
01:56:37,321 --> 01:56:40,200
they gave you a,
some Dojo or I'm not sure what the

2666
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:43,950
correct terminology is.
It might've been probably watching when

2667
01:56:43,951 --> 01:56:45,000
I got my black belt.
Yeah,

2668
01:56:45,001 --> 01:56:46,220
maybe that was it.
But anyway.

2669
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,151
Yeah,
like all,

2670
01:56:47,151 --> 01:56:48,760
like there was a lot of guys around
just.

2671
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:50,650
And I know that Coco does it,
Joe,

2672
01:56:50,651 --> 01:56:52,280
he does it.
He loves it and he said,

2673
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:54,270
why don't you do it?
You're a strapping man.

2674
01:56:54,271 --> 01:56:56,880
You talked to Eddie about going to do it
one day,

2675
01:56:57,020 --> 01:56:58,200
do it,
so he said,

2676
01:56:58,201 --> 01:56:58,981
uh,
he said,

2677
01:56:58,981 --> 01:56:59,761
yeah,
he said,

2678
01:56:59,761 --> 01:57:01,490
come down one day and he'll,
you know,

2679
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:03,180
get me into like,
one of the beginners classes.

2680
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:04,330
I think I need to do it.

2681
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:06,480
Fuck yeah.
Could make me feel a little bit more,

2682
01:57:06,481 --> 01:57:07,520
um,
know,

2683
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:09,400
like you said,
some of them that just a,

2684
01:57:09,610 --> 01:57:10,443
I don't know,
some.

2685
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:13,230
And especially like if people get
bullied and then they don't have like a

2686
01:57:13,231 --> 01:57:17,160
brother or they don't have a friend or
they don't even have somebody to go talk

2687
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:18,030
to,
to be like,

2688
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:19,410
oh man.
And then their blooded,

2689
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:19,821
he'd be like,
oh,

2690
01:57:19,821 --> 01:57:20,670
it's okay.
You know,

2691
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:23,000
like that seat that's,
that can make you know.

2692
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:26,130
Then that person gets stuck inside
themselves just feeling like,

2693
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:28,770
you know,
like they're not going to be okay.

2694
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:29,760
No,
no.

2695
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,800
It's terrifying.
And then everywhere you go,

2696
01:57:31,801 --> 01:57:33,390
you're,
you're just scared of running into this

2697
01:57:33,391 --> 01:57:34,380
guy.
Yeah,

2698
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:35,400
very,
very,

2699
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:36,560
very bad.
You know,

2700
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:38,700
she'd get into tenements,
do it.

2701
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:43,830
It's a fucking natural animal
inclination to pick on the weak,

2702
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:48,000
you know,
only humans realize it and stop it.

2703
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:52,290
And actually tell people not to do it
and understand the effect that it has on

2704
01:57:52,291 --> 01:57:54,450
the people that do it,
but every animal does it.

2705
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,040
Dogs do it,
chickens do it.

2706
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:59,100
Chickens have a pecking order.
They fuck with one chicken and then they

2707
01:57:59,101 --> 01:57:59,821
all decided,
oh,

2708
01:57:59,821 --> 01:58:02,790
let's fuck with this bitch.
And they all attack her for no reason.

2709
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:04,320
It's weird man.
And you've seen it.

2710
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:07,590
Everybody's seen dogs do it.
One dog will blow up and the other dog,

2711
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:10,230
the dog will cower.
And then they decided the pecking order.

2712
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,570
I mean,
and then that dog will always go near

2713
01:58:12,571 --> 01:58:14,460
that dog and fuck with them and growl at
them.

2714
01:58:14,461 --> 01:58:16,100
Maybe bite his year or something like
that.

2715
01:58:16,101 --> 01:58:20,430
Yeah,
it's a weird thing that animals figured

2716
01:58:20,431 --> 01:58:24,990
out how to make sure that the only ones
that get to breed are the ones that are

2717
01:58:24,991 --> 01:58:28,590
confident and powerful and can overcome
problems.

2718
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:31,640
Okay.
And one of the problems is other mating

2719
01:58:32,910 --> 01:58:36,690
viable males that want to meet with the
women that you want to meet with,

2720
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,540
like with this fucking giraffe.
They wound up killing those three other

2721
01:58:39,541 --> 01:58:41,410
drafts.
This guy just was like,

2722
01:58:41,411 --> 01:58:44,350
fuck these bitches coming up.
I'm going to smash my head into these

2723
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:45,430
drafts.
Stop them.

2724
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:47,320
You ain't fucking these girls when you
get older.

2725
01:58:47,321 --> 01:58:51,040
Fuck you bitch,
and this is just a natural inclination

2726
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:55,810
that animals have to find the weak and
force it out and we don't have it.

2727
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:57,790
Well we do.
We did have it.

2728
01:58:57,791 --> 01:58:59,740
Fortunately we haven't less now.
I said,

2729
01:58:59,741 --> 01:59:01,780
well,
we realize because of communication,

2730
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:03,790
right?
We realized that there's devastating

2731
01:59:03,791 --> 01:59:06,490
effects in this.
Then we have loving and caring

2732
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:09,100
communities and we have compassion that
you shouldn't do that,

2733
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:13,690
but there's an inclination that people
have to pick on the weak and attack the

2734
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:13,900
weak.

2735
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:16,210
It's very.
It's very disturbing,

2736
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:19,750
but it's also very logical in terms of
like biology,

2737
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:22,420
right?
We're trying to make it difficult for

2738
01:59:22,421 --> 01:59:26,560
males to breed.
It's not like we have very few people

2739
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:28,450
and we're trying to make as many people
as we get.

2740
01:59:28,451 --> 01:59:28,661
No,
no,

2741
01:59:28,661 --> 01:59:32,050
no.
It's like the highest status mails and

2742
01:59:32,051 --> 01:59:36,850
the dominant males are competing against
these other males in order to be able to

2743
01:59:36,851 --> 01:59:37,970
breed with,
you know,

2744
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:41,760
whatever lizards are fucking wolves or
any,

2745
01:59:41,761 --> 01:59:45,850
any in any species.
The high status male wolf is the one who

2746
01:59:45,851 --> 01:59:49,720
gets to breed with the the choice
females and this is how they're carrying

2747
01:59:49,721 --> 01:59:51,850
their genes on.
It happens in deer,

2748
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:54,340
it happens in elk,
it happens in all these different

2749
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:57,500
animals and they fight.
I mean the reason why these,

2750
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:59,890
these antlers.
Elk.

2751
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:01,720
Yeah.
Those are for fighting.

2752
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:05,140
That's all there for.
They actually lose those fucking things.

2753
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:07,000
After they're done breeding,
really.

2754
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:08,920
They fall off and they grow back again
the next year.

2755
02:00:08,921 --> 02:00:13,921
That is the fastest body part growth
known to man is elk antlers and that,

2756
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,370
I mean when you look at those,
it looks like it would take 70 years to

2757
02:00:18,371 --> 02:00:21,730
grow the grow those motherfuckers at a
couple of months and then it'll grow

2758
02:00:21,731 --> 02:00:26,731
bigger next year up until a point,
sometime around like age nine or 10.

2759
02:00:26,741 --> 02:00:28,930
Sometimes they taper off and they start
to decline.

2760
02:00:28,931 --> 02:00:31,510
As they get older,
their their antlers actually become

2761
02:00:31,511 --> 02:00:34,420
smaller and smaller,
but for the most part as the.

2762
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:38,170
That's one of the reasons why people
want to shoot a big male is because that

2763
02:00:38,171 --> 02:00:42,160
male with big antlers,
that male spread his genetics for many,

2764
02:00:42,161 --> 02:00:46,300
many years.
So his genes are will long passed on.

2765
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:48,610
He's probably a bread with dozens of
females.

2766
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,241
Oh,
I see.

2767
02:00:49,241 --> 02:00:51,820
So if it has a,
it's obviously been alive a long time

2768
02:00:51,821 --> 02:00:54,220
and it has that family treat is hanging
out of the front of its head.

2769
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:55,510
Exactly.
And you know,

2770
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:57,100
okay,
this thing is already.

2771
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:58,600
It's already prospered.
Yeah.

2772
02:00:58,601 --> 02:01:02,060
And the idea also is that to only shoot
those mails,

2773
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:03,670
those,
those high status,

2774
02:01:03,671 --> 02:01:06,040
big males,
it's actually better for the population

2775
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:09,730
because then the younger males get a
chance to become older because they'll

2776
02:01:09,731 --> 02:01:11,860
kill them.
They killed young males.

2777
02:01:11,861 --> 02:01:15,190
If a young male gets fucking frisky and
he thinks he's a bad ass,

2778
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:17,020
the big old bowl,
fuck him up.

2779
02:01:17,021 --> 02:01:21,040
And one of the ways they fuck them up as
their antlers are longer so they can get

2780
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:23,650
the young one when the young one can't
get him.

2781
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:26,260
Nothing Ms Dot Kinda Kinda evil,
but your,

2782
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:31,060
your weapons are dictated by your age.
It's really weird,

2783
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,620
right?
And your strength and like how,

2784
02:01:33,010 --> 02:01:34,330
how,
how much vitality you have.

2785
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:36,850
That's what grows your antlers out in
that.

2786
02:01:37,350 --> 02:01:39,980
Fascinating that.
That's how it all

2787
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:43,580
that it's all put together like that.
It is fucked up and they bullied the

2788
02:01:43,581 --> 02:01:46,330
shit out of those young bowls.
They chase them away.

2789
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:48,760
You get no pussy.
Those,

2790
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:50,950
those young bulls are,
they call them satellite bowls there.

2791
02:01:50,951 --> 02:01:53,490
So horny.
Are they hanging on the outside of the

2792
02:01:53,530 --> 02:01:56,210
blues?
That's why they're susceptible to

2793
02:01:56,211 --> 02:01:59,000
hunters because hunters like make a cow
calling.

2794
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,060
They make this go like,
hey,

2795
02:02:02,061 --> 02:02:04,040
who wants to fuck one to fuck?
And then they get shot.

2796
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:06,163
Yeah.
So they get.

2797
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:09,050
That's one of the things about elk
hunting that's so interesting,

2798
02:02:09,051 --> 02:02:13,850
so that you call them in actually make
sounds to try to bring them towards you.

2799
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:16,640
So they think they're going to get some
pussy or they think there's a fight.

2800
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,090
That's the other thing you do.
You make a bugle and they have these

2801
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:22,960
horns,
you blow bugles and then the,

2802
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:24,260
the elk will go,
what?

2803
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:27,220
You want someone to bitch and I'll come
around the corner for.

2804
02:02:27,330 --> 02:02:29,900
Yeah,
looking for another elk to fuck up and

2805
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:32,900
then shoot them.
Would you ever get in like a suit or

2806
02:02:32,901 --> 02:02:35,080
anything like that into it and pretend
to be an l,

2807
02:02:35,270 --> 02:02:37,160
like sneak up on them.
They have actual,

2808
02:02:37,210 --> 02:02:39,800
uh,
elk decoys that they use that they

2809
02:02:39,801 --> 02:02:44,030
actually put on the front of the bow.
So like say if you were shooting your

2810
02:02:44,031 --> 02:02:45,590
bow right,
you've got your bow here.

2811
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:49,240
Extending in front of your bow is like
a,

2812
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:51,520
an it looks like,
like,

2813
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:54,380
like a female elk.
It's like a deep.

2814
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:58,010
And you're actually shooting through her
at the ELC.

2815
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:01,160
Oh,
it's like a decor that you put on in

2816
02:03:01,161 --> 02:03:03,470
front of your boat.
You're drawing back your bow.

2817
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:06,170
We got something here.
It's like a pocket pussy but with a

2818
02:03:06,171 --> 02:03:08,910
weapon in it.
Elk Buhner that boy,

2819
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:10,123
what is this?

2820
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:12,870
That is weird.
Popped up when I typed it out.

2821
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:14,810
It's a new product.
What does it say?

2822
02:03:14,811 --> 02:03:19,410
Adjustable fit ball cap.
So what is that mask?

2823
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:22,580
It's an l k.
that's a good way to get shot by a dude.

2824
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:23,351
Oh,
it's a good point.

2825
02:03:23,351 --> 02:03:25,100
One of those on a one off to.
Oh,

2826
02:03:25,101 --> 02:03:26,480
so that's what.
That is what it is.

2827
02:03:26,481 --> 02:03:27,890
It's like an elk head,
you know,

2828
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:29,840
has one of those.
John Dudley has something like that.

2829
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:33,350
It's like here's your.
Where's your chicken?

2830
02:03:33,351 --> 02:03:37,070
Or tricking him looking girl filter.
That's what you look like.

2831
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:39,440
I don't think their vision is very good.
Oh,

2832
02:03:39,441 --> 02:03:41,750
I see.
I think their vision is a.

2833
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:44,760
have you ever watched any of them have
sex or they don't?

2834
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:45,710
Yeah.
Yeah,

2835
02:03:45,711 --> 02:03:47,540
I saw one of them.
I saw a male,

2836
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:50,350
a elk fuck a female.
It was crazy.

2837
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:52,660
Really?
Is it pretty cool or is it mashed?

2838
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:54,500
It.
He smashed it so hard.

2839
02:03:54,501 --> 02:03:57,950
She went flying forward when she got
tackled and went down to a front knees.

2840
02:03:58,490 --> 02:04:00,980
Dan,
he just climbed on top and he's a one

2841
02:04:00,981 --> 02:04:02,420
pump chump.
Boom.

2842
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:05,330
He just slammed into it.
Could you tell?

2843
02:04:05,331 --> 02:04:06,820
He felt good after it.
He seemed like whatever.

2844
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:10,880
He was screaming when they're fucking
and when they're in heat,

2845
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:13,430
in the breeding,
in the Rut they call it.

2846
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:16,070
It's amazing to watch.
I mean,

2847
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:18,200
this is something they only do once a
year,

2848
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:21,650
so
for 11 months out of the year,

2849
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:24,710
they're cool with each other.
They're all just hanging out together

2850
02:04:24,850 --> 02:04:28,820
and one month out of the year to chaos,
just fighting to the death with other

2851
02:04:28,821 --> 02:04:31,990
males smashing into it and then every
girl they get a chance,

2852
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:36,140
they bang it out and then when it's over
it's over.

2853
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:39,360
And then this is a cycle of life and
then in the spring the new calves are

2854
02:04:39,361 --> 02:04:44,361
born and then they grow up and then a
year later they're hanging around in the

2855
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:48,000
pack and then they get older as they get
older.

2856
02:04:48,001 --> 02:04:51,390
The challenge,
the old bowl for dominance and chases

2857
02:04:51,391 --> 02:04:53,160
them away and yeah,
it's,

2858
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:56,730
it's a fascinating sort of a ecosystem
when you want.

2859
02:04:56,731 --> 02:04:58,980
And then you know,
there's always rules and there's always

2860
02:04:58,981 --> 02:05:01,620
bears and there's all these things are
trying to eat them and mountain lions

2861
02:05:01,621 --> 02:05:03,150
are killing them.
It's amazing.

2862
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:07,020
That's wild man.
It's neat that you're so in tune with

2863
02:05:07,021 --> 02:05:09,870
all of that stuff and that you,
you know,

2864
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:12,660
you're into those worlds.
That sounds like a lot of fun,

2865
02:05:12,661 --> 02:05:13,680
you know?
Well,

2866
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:18,010
it's really interesting.
Even if I never ever hunted again,

2867
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:21,460
um,
I would still be fascinated by wildlife.

2868
02:05:21,550 --> 02:05:25,420
It is just,
it's one of the more interesting things

2869
02:05:25,421 --> 02:05:28,030
about being alive.
There's these other things that are

2870
02:05:28,031 --> 02:05:30,400
alive too,
and they're nothing like us.

2871
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:33,950
They are nothing like us.
We're the outliers really.

2872
02:05:34,030 --> 02:05:35,410
Oh,
for sure.

2873
02:05:35,710 --> 02:05:38,380
For sure.
But we're the ones who are separated

2874
02:05:38,381 --> 02:05:40,900
from them so completely that if we see
one,

2875
02:05:40,901 --> 02:05:43,930
it's like a bird sitting on a flag pole
or it's,

2876
02:05:43,931 --> 02:05:45,700
you know,
it's fucking coyote and your

2877
02:05:45,701 --> 02:05:46,660
neighborhood.
Whoa.

2878
02:05:46,661 --> 02:05:48,010
What's he doing here?
You know,

2879
02:05:48,011 --> 02:05:49,330
like the,
or a dog,

2880
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:51,460
which is like our friend,
you know,

2881
02:05:51,461 --> 02:05:53,110
dot.
I don't even count them as animals.

2882
02:05:53,111 --> 02:05:55,510
I know they're animals,
but they're our friends.

2883
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:58,450
It's like when you have dogs,
either they're dependent upon us for

2884
02:05:58,451 --> 02:06:00,250
food.
They're part of the family.

2885
02:06:00,251 --> 02:06:04,540
It's a totally different deal than like
a pet wolf or a pet bear or some shit.

2886
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:07,520
There's an episode where somebody's dog
plays family feud with them,

2887
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:10,480
know what I'm saying?
So that's A.

2888
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:13,190
Yeah,
you what other animals going to do that?

2889
02:06:13,370 --> 02:06:18,370
I saw a dude online who had talked is he
trained his dog to get him a beer and he

2890
02:06:19,101 --> 02:06:21,650
put a t.
He tied a towel to the door of the

2891
02:06:21,651 --> 02:06:22,970
refrigerator.
You'd say,

2892
02:06:22,971 --> 02:06:25,130
go get me a beer,
and the dog would go there.

2893
02:06:25,131 --> 02:06:27,200
She would grab a hold of towel,
pull on it.

2894
02:06:27,201 --> 02:06:30,200
It would open up the door to the fridge,
should reach in,

2895
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:34,490
grab a can of beer,
run over hand the can of beer to him.

2896
02:06:34,491 --> 02:06:35,250
He'd say,
good now.

2897
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:38,180
Go close the door.
And she would go close the door.

2898
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:40,970
She would go grab that towel and use it
to shut that door.

2899
02:06:40,971 --> 02:06:42,500
I was like,
that is insane.

2900
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:45,050
That is a super trained animal,
man.

2901
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,030
Yeah.
I never had a dog.

2902
02:06:47,031 --> 02:06:49,280
I knew we were talking last night at the
company or about your dog and you,

2903
02:06:49,281 --> 02:06:49,861
you,
you know,

2904
02:06:49,861 --> 02:06:51,550
you guys always seem to be super happy.
Like,

2905
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,460
uh,
when y'all go running and everything

2906
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:54,370
we're talking about,
it's cool.

2907
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:55,540
Do you,
uh,

2908
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:57,370
ever have any pets?
No,

2909
02:06:57,371 --> 02:06:59,800
I never had any pets.
They were grown up a lot of

2910
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:02,670
responsibility.
They had scary dogs,

2911
02:07:02,710 --> 02:07:05,200
like they had loose dogs and our
neighborhoods like rottweilers,

2912
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:07,370
Dobermans,
you know,

2913
02:07:07,390 --> 02:07:08,710
so it was like,
it wasn't.

2914
02:07:08,711 --> 02:07:12,130
Nobody had a pet like everybody had,
like there were two dogs that were like,

2915
02:07:12,131 --> 02:07:12,964
fuck,
you know,

2916
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:15,310
you'd see him fucking and sometimes like
attack.

2917
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:18,160
So it was kind of exciting,
but it wasn't like.

2918
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:22,660
And then a lot of animals got hit by my
house by this highway by trucks and so

2919
02:07:22,661 --> 02:07:24,790
we'd go bury the animals sometimes.
Oh really?

2920
02:07:24,791 --> 02:07:26,590
Yeah.
So we'd go get the animal,

2921
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,180
you know,
pull them right off this little highway

2922
02:07:28,181 --> 02:07:29,560
and Barium.
But um,

2923
02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:31,660
but yeah,
I never had a pet,

2924
02:07:31,661 --> 02:07:33,940
but I would like to have one if I can
get a home one time,

2925
02:07:33,941 --> 02:07:35,050
you know,
a home,

2926
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:36,190
a wife and stuff.

2927
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,810
And I think I would like to have an
animal.

2928
02:07:37,811 --> 02:07:39,340
You know,
they're fun man,

2929
02:07:39,341 --> 02:07:42,100
but you gotta really know what you're
getting into.

2930
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:44,560
If you go out of town,
you're going to need somebody to watch

2931
02:07:44,561 --> 02:07:46,730
it,
feed it and take care of it,

2932
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:51,130
get that going to make sure you have a
big enough yard where your dog and get

2933
02:07:51,131 --> 02:07:54,510
some exercise and they're going to shit
all over the place.

2934
02:07:54,511 --> 02:07:56,200
You're going to have to learn how you
pick that up.

2935
02:07:56,201 --> 02:07:58,620
You're gonna have to pick that shit up,
you know?

2936
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,550
Can you teach them to shit and like a
hole or something?

2937
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,410
Nope.
Nope.

2938
02:08:02,411 --> 02:08:04,150
They shit.
Wherever they go outside,

2939
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:07,720
they just find a spot and say this is a
good spot to shit and they just dropped

2940
02:08:07,721 --> 02:08:12,721
logs
and then you got logs all over your lawn

2941
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:18,580
and if you go two days without cleaning
those logs and you got eight logs and

2942
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:24,260
pick up and have three dogs show logos
so dogs makes nutro logs,

2943
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:28,050
logs.

2944
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:31,210
You got to go around cleaning it up and
if I don't clean it up,

2945
02:08:31,211 --> 02:08:33,850
I'll have that fucking smell going to be
out in the yard.

2946
02:08:33,851 --> 02:08:37,420
Like
shit's mouse and you got to get the

2947
02:08:37,421 --> 02:08:40,300
scraper,
little scraper and scrape the logs.

2948
02:08:40,301 --> 02:08:42,370
And the.
I have a place I'd dump them into.

2949
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:44,110
Yeah,
it's nasty.

2950
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:47,800
Scooping up shit.
Imagine if your grandma just shit all

2951
02:08:47,801 --> 02:08:49,420
over your yard.
Just go out.

2952
02:08:49,450 --> 02:08:51,850
Go out in the lawn.
Just shits in the yard,

2953
02:08:52,030 --> 02:08:54,100
shits on the lawn like grandmas out
there.

2954
02:08:54,101 --> 02:08:55,420
Shit.
I got to clean up or shit.

2955
02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:56,950
I love her.
But God,

2956
02:08:56,951 --> 02:09:00,130
I hate cleaning her shit.
Ya'll would hate cleaning up probably

2957
02:09:00,131 --> 02:09:02,830
human shit for some reason.
But I remember them dog shit.

2958
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:04,860
Well,
when I was a kid that had a blend or

2959
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:06,190
neighborhood named Mario,
right?

2960
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,140
And He,
uh,

2961
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:10,170
and he was dude,
he ended up dying actually.

2962
02:09:10,170 --> 02:09:11,980
He did some pills and drove into an
embankment,

2963
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:15,040
but he,
when I was young he would shit in his

2964
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:16,150
yard,
make me bury it.

2965
02:09:16,270 --> 02:09:18,640
And that's how,
that's how I was allowed to be friends

2966
02:09:18,641 --> 02:09:21,460
with him.
How did he make you bury it?

2967
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:24,730
He just asked me to do it and I was
afraid not to do it.

2968
02:09:24,731 --> 02:09:25,780
I said,
Yo Dude,

2969
02:09:25,781 --> 02:09:27,580
you're not going to believe this,
but I took a shit.

2970
02:09:27,610 --> 02:09:30,640
And in my yard I can't even bury it
because I'll throw up.

2971
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:32,080
Hey,
do me a favor and go bury it.

2972
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:33,160
Yeah,
he was,

2973
02:09:33,161 --> 02:09:34,270
he did.
He was dark man.

2974
02:09:34,271 --> 02:09:36,330
He had a,
he had a real dark vision and he would,

2975
02:09:36,331 --> 02:09:37,810
uh,
he would,

2976
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:39,280
I mean he probably honestly,
dude,

2977
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:43,610
he probably shit 200,
300 times and I buried it.

2978
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:46,660
I swear to God on,
I swear to God,

2979
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:48,880
I swear to God dude.

2980
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:51,190
And He um,
had to not run out of places to make new

2981
02:09:51,191 --> 02:09:53,890
holes.
Did you think you ever dug up old shit

2982
02:09:53,891 --> 02:09:56,260
to put in new shit?
Oh yeah.

2983
02:09:56,261 --> 02:09:59,530
I wouldn't be surprised man.
We basically had like the only setup,

2984
02:09:59,531 --> 02:10:01,530
I had not even have a strong system.
The only setup,

2985
02:10:01,531 --> 02:10:04,750
I was like one of those plastic.
A beach.

2986
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:07,630
Oh no setup.
I was seven.

2987
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:09,760
So wait a minute.
This seven year old was doing this.

2988
02:10:09,761 --> 02:10:11,260
How old was he?
He was eight or nine.

2989
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:13,270
Oh,
he's tricking you buy an older.

2990
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:18,070
He was older and two years when you're
seven is a long stretch now when you 32,

2991
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,050
30 2:34,
that don't mean shit.

2992
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:20,913
Whatever.
Dude.

2993
02:10:21,090 --> 02:10:23,080
Seven and nine.
That's a big stretch.

2994
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:23,921
Yeah.
You go shit.

2995
02:10:23,921 --> 02:10:24,754
At your house,
Buddy.

2996
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:28,810
That's what I tell people now.
For too long he would.

2997
02:10:29,050 --> 02:10:30,730
What was the,
do you remember the first?

2998
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:32,170
There's no way.
You really remember.

2999
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:34,790
I remember what,
I don't remember what he said,

3000
02:10:34,791 --> 02:10:36,560
but I remember.
How did it happen?

3001
02:10:36,561 --> 02:10:40,190
How did it happen when you find yourself
with a plastic shovel and another

3002
02:10:40,191 --> 02:10:41,840
person?
Shit going down.

3003
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:44,090
How did it come to this?
Well,

3004
02:10:44,091 --> 02:10:47,870
it came to it because he,
I know my brother probably wasn't around

3005
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:51,560
and I wanted somebody to play with and
he was older so I was hanging out and he

3006
02:10:51,561 --> 02:10:52,890
was deviant man.
How?

3007
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:55,400
So?
He just had a little bit of like,

3008
02:10:55,401 --> 02:10:58,010
um,
like he was kind of slithering,

3009
02:10:58,011 --> 02:10:59,690
you know what I'm talking about from
mom.

3010
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:02,030
He knew how to manipulate you.
Yeah.

3011
02:11:02,031 --> 02:11:03,800
He was obviously burgers.
Shit.

3012
02:11:03,801 --> 02:11:05,990
200 plus times.
Like there wasn't here.

3013
02:11:05,991 --> 02:11:08,320
The same color on the outside of design.
The inside of his.

3014
02:11:08,350 --> 02:11:10,040
It took them about demon.
Yeah,

3015
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:11,660
like a light day.
Diablo?

3016
02:11:11,810 --> 02:11:12,740
Yeah,
like an ld below.

3017
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:15,590
But also who was an elementary school.
Interesting.

3018
02:11:15,670 --> 02:11:16,670
Um,
but he,

3019
02:11:16,671 --> 02:11:18,560
uh,
so when you first found yourself,

3020
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:22,760
do you remember the feeling that you
first found when you were digging a hole

3021
02:11:22,761 --> 02:11:23,840
for a dude?
Shit.

3022
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:25,340
Like,
just thinking,

3023
02:11:25,341 --> 02:11:27,080
what am I?
How long can I do this?

3024
02:11:27,081 --> 02:11:29,390
What if he keeps asking,
how do I stop this?

3025
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:32,330
How did you wind up stopping?
That's maybe a better question.

3026
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:34,610
You know what?
I don't remember how it kind of,

3027
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:35,300
you know,
pat,

3028
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:36,500
you know how he turned off?
Yeah,

3029
02:11:36,510 --> 02:11:40,670
petered off.
I don't remember how it kind of tapered

3030
02:11:40,671 --> 02:11:42,830
off to his parents ever.
Like,

3031
02:11:42,831 --> 02:11:44,150
Hey,
do you ever shit in the house?

3032
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:46,730
How come we don't have any missing
toilet paper?

3033
02:11:47,190 --> 02:11:48,560
Well,
did you know that's what I think it was.

3034
02:11:48,561 --> 02:11:52,520
I think he was lazy.
He was serious and he shut outside

3035
02:11:52,521 --> 02:11:55,430
behind his slide.
They had a slide in his yard because

3036
02:11:55,431 --> 02:11:55,851
they had,
you know,

3037
02:11:55,851 --> 02:11:59,990
a little bit of money and he shot
outside behind the slot is a great word

3038
02:11:59,991 --> 02:12:00,500
too,
by the way.

3039
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:04,460
And it was silty kind of soil and sand.
And I remember going over then I still

3040
02:12:04,461 --> 02:12:06,470
remember,
I don't remember the shade of it

3041
02:12:06,471 --> 02:12:07,710
honestly.
Would it look like,

3042
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:12,620
I would say like a tope,
but a little with a little more brown

3043
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:16,670
and you can always find coyote shit
because it has like little berries in

3044
02:12:16,671 --> 02:12:18,860
it.
A lot of times coyotes eat all kinds of

3045
02:12:18,861 --> 02:12:19,610
things.
Yeah.

3046
02:12:19,610 --> 02:12:20,660
Yeah.
Eat some berries.

3047
02:12:20,661 --> 02:12:23,630
Sometimes I'll see these logs,
like these little red berries in and I'm

3048
02:12:23,631 --> 02:12:24,910
like,
Oh God,

3049
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:28,120
Shit.
It's always a dark brown to their shit's

3050
02:12:28,121 --> 02:12:29,720
super consistent.
It's weird.

3051
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:32,800
Goose has have fancy shit sometimes I
see him.

3052
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:34,970
You mean disgusting?
Yeah.

3053
02:12:34,971 --> 02:12:37,080
I never liked it,
but it seems creatures.

3054
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:40,580
Yeah,
and that's a bait and switch by mother

3055
02:12:40,581 --> 02:12:42,200
nature because if you see a goose you
think,

3056
02:12:42,201 --> 02:12:43,100
oh,
this is fun,

3057
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:46,040
this can be exciting,
and then they'll fucking choke out an

3058
02:12:46,041 --> 02:12:46,820
infant at a park.

3059
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:49,820
I mean gooses are violent.
They're violent,

3060
02:12:50,030 --> 02:12:51,050
extremely violent,
and they,

3061
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:52,640
they,
they fight impacts,

3062
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:58,800
impacts where they do.
I have a friend who had a house on a

3063
02:12:59,361 --> 02:13:03,050
lake and they had a wire all around the
lake.

3064
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:05,630
I was like,
what's the wire for delegates to keep

3065
02:13:05,631 --> 02:13:09,500
the goose from going into the water?
They don't want them to waddle and into

3066
02:13:09,501 --> 02:13:11,090
the water of the things.
I was like,

3067
02:13:11,091 --> 02:13:13,160
is that electric?
Like what kind of fence is that?

3068
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:16,520
I'm not sure if they.
I'm not sure if it's electric.

3069
02:13:16,521 --> 02:13:19,970
It might give them a little shock,
but the idea was to try to keep the.

3070
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:23,020
Because they shit all over their lawn.
The shit all over near where the.

3071
02:13:23,190 --> 02:13:26,660
They had a pond in their yard.
They're looks like the ultimate,

3072
02:13:26,830 --> 02:13:29,100
like the Kid Marissa,
just like that kid Mario.

3073
02:13:29,101 --> 02:13:32,070
But a bird.
Bollinger you and have a pond in your

3074
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,080
yard.
Like you want to go fishing?

3075
02:13:34,081 --> 02:13:35,820
Yeah,
let's take five steps out of my

3076
02:13:35,910 --> 02:13:37,630
backyard.
You know?

3077
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:40,530
I mean that is like the ultimate,
but I don't think that's it.

3078
02:13:40,531 --> 02:13:43,170
I don't think if you have a natural hill
in new yard kind of.

3079
02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:46,200
I don't think that's that expensive to
get water would it?

3080
02:13:46,210 --> 02:13:49,950
And to get a pump put in.
I don't think it's that drastic man.

3081
02:13:49,951 --> 02:13:52,590
I would think that'd be a nightmare,
but they're going to make sure it

3082
02:13:52,591 --> 02:13:54,450
doesn't leak like you had.
I'm like,

3083
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:59,460
what's going to keep the water there?
It takes a special kind of bottom,

3084
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:04,550
like when you go to a natural lake,
like that's the water is pulled up there

3085
02:14:04,861 --> 02:14:07,320
for a reason.
Like that's an unusual ground.

3086
02:14:07,321 --> 02:14:09,410
You got to realize if you're looking at
a natural leg,

3087
02:14:09,411 --> 02:14:12,960
unless it's a glacial lake,
waters decide to stay there.

3088
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:16,590
Whereas the same amount of water's
probably landed everywhere,

3089
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:19,740
but it's decided to stay there.
So what the hell is different between

3090
02:14:19,741 --> 02:14:22,170
that ground and all the other ground
around it.

3091
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:25,650
So when you want to make a pond,
you just can't make a pond everywhere.

3092
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:28,200
There's a reason why there's not a pond
there because that's not the kind of

3093
02:14:28,201 --> 02:14:30,960
ground for a pond.
So they would have to put a liner in.

3094
02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:31,930
Ah,
you got to teen mother.

3095
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:34,770
It's like taming mother nature almost.
You have to do something.

3096
02:14:34,771 --> 02:14:37,350
You can't just pour water in there and
you've got to do something.

3097
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:39,270
And one of the things that they do in a
lot of places,

3098
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:41,910
they use this really thick Koi pond
liner.

3099
02:14:41,911 --> 02:14:45,510
It's basically a plastic liner.
So you got a bullshit ass fake pond is

3100
02:14:45,511 --> 02:14:47,070
what you got that's going to look
shitty.

3101
02:14:47,071 --> 02:14:48,810
Go above ground pool.

3102
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:49,590
Yeah.
No,

3103
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:51,750
basically the above ground pool of
ponds.

3104
02:14:51,751 --> 02:14:53,150
It's not even organized,
you know?

3105
02:14:53,190 --> 02:14:55,860
Well,
once they get the liner in place,

3106
02:14:55,861 --> 02:15:00,450
then they put surface levels of dirt and
rocks and stuff over the line or.

3107
02:15:00,451 --> 02:15:04,440
So it looks like a regular pond,
but the thing is what's holding the

3108
02:15:04,441 --> 02:15:08,760
water in place in some places they,
they'll use those Koi pond you ever

3109
02:15:08,761 --> 02:15:09,594
seen?
You know what a coin.

3110
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:11,131
It's big.
Beautiful.

3111
02:15:11,131 --> 02:15:12,180
At a restaurant.
Yeah.

3112
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:16,950
They have very thick liner that they
used for the base of that Shit.

3113
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:22,280
Used that stuff on float tanks to
flotation tanks.

3114
02:15:22,651 --> 02:15:24,150
We floated them.
Uh Nah.

3115
02:15:24,470 --> 02:15:26,490
I mean I've heard you talk about it
before.

3116
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:28,980
The liner of those things is the same
thing.

3117
02:15:28,981 --> 02:15:31,290
It's Koi pond,
like a liner.

3118
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:33,030
It's like a real thick,
durable,

3119
02:15:33,031 --> 02:15:34,950
tough plastic.
Does it feel like you're alive when

3120
02:15:34,951 --> 02:15:35,784
you're in the tank?

3121
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:38,490
Yeah.
It feels like you're relaxing.

3122
02:15:38,790 --> 02:15:39,900
You know,
it's a good feeling.

3123
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:42,510
It feels good on your body.
It just alleviates tension,

3124
02:15:42,511 --> 02:15:45,030
but it also feels like you're in this
meditative state.

3125
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:47,010
You relax and you think about things
better.

3126
02:15:47,011 --> 02:15:49,890
There you get a good,
good thought of,

3127
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,010
you know,
what,

3128
02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:53,640
how you,
how to look at things from an outside

3129
02:15:53,670 --> 02:15:55,470
looking in perspective.
Yeah.

3130
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:59,130
You get a chance to be away from your
body really because you're not thinking

3131
02:15:59,131 --> 02:16:00,600
about your body just floating.
Oh,

3132
02:16:00,601 --> 02:16:02,590
I like that.
You're not feeling your body at all.

3133
02:16:02,650 --> 02:16:05,070
The water is the same temperature as
your skin,

3134
02:16:05,071 --> 02:16:07,470
so you don't.
You can't even tell where the water is

3135
02:16:07,471 --> 02:16:09,780
and where the,
where your body is.

3136
02:16:09,781 --> 02:16:11,140
So I like that.
Yeah.

3137
02:16:11,141 --> 02:16:14,400
I just feel like you're flying through
the air and it's all dark and you don't

3138
02:16:14,401 --> 02:16:16,290
see anything.
You don't hear anything because your

3139
02:16:16,291 --> 02:16:17,124
ears are underwater.

3140
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:19,350
Does it feel dead?
Do you feel like might be dead or not?

3141
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:20,370
No,
definitely not.

3142
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:23,910
I like that he worried about the feeling
of dead.

3143
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:26,160
I'm just worried about how does the
fizz.

3144
02:16:26,161 --> 02:16:28,920
Any like does your brain keep going,
you know,

3145
02:16:28,921 --> 02:16:30,700
or whatever it is.
That keeps us going in our.

3146
02:16:30,710 --> 02:16:32,090
Like when you die,
he like,

3147
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:34,780
does our consciousness,
does it just leave out of this shell and

3148
02:16:34,781 --> 02:16:36,520
then we're just part of this straight up
fucking.

3149
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:40,240
I think part of the thing is when we're
thinking about consciousness,

3150
02:16:40,241 --> 02:16:43,060
we're thinking about language,
so we're thinking about the way we talk

3151
02:16:43,070 --> 02:16:46,030
and think about a feeling.
Yeah,

3152
02:16:46,090 --> 02:16:48,640
because I think what we think of as
consciousness,

3153
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:51,920
when I think of it,
when my own limited mind,

3154
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:55,630
when I think of consciousness,
I think of consciousness as me using

3155
02:16:55,631 --> 02:16:58,570
language to interpret how I feel about
different things.

3156
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:04,460
I have this a language touch to it.
I think if something happens when you

3157
02:17:06,131 --> 02:17:10,660
die in your soul goes to another place.
Let's say a soul as a real thing or

3158
02:17:10,661 --> 02:17:11,770
consciousness,
a real thing.

3159
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:15,910
I bet it goes there with no language and
I bet that's real similar.

3160
02:17:15,911 --> 02:17:19,060
I bet to what it feels like when you're
really tripping,

3161
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:25,180
when you're on some heavy psychedelics
and you just melt into the universe and

3162
02:17:25,181 --> 02:17:27,520
you.
You sort of ceased to exist on some of

3163
02:17:27,521 --> 02:17:30,900
them,
like five Meo dmt been,

3164
02:17:31,130 --> 02:17:34,150
yeah,
melt into the center of the universe.

3165
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:38,350
You feel like you don't exist anymore.
I bet death and that feels like you're

3166
02:17:38,351 --> 02:17:39,184
dying to.
That's.

3167
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:40,570
That's a scary one.
Five.

3168
02:17:40,571 --> 02:17:44,890
MEO DMT is a universally disturbing one.
Lot of people have problem with that one

3169
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:46,510
because it really does feel like you're
dying.

3170
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:48,310
Can senior citizens do it or not?

3171
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:49,450
I think they can.
Yeah.

3172
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:51,550
I think the.
The only problem would be if you had a

3173
02:17:51,551 --> 02:17:55,600
heart attack freaked out.
I'm think it's toxic because your body

3174
02:17:55,601 --> 02:17:57,470
makes it.
Your body knows what to do with it too.

3175
02:17:57,471 --> 02:18:01,240
You know your body knows how to bring
you back down to sobriety levels in like

3176
02:18:01,241 --> 02:18:02,320
15,
20 minutes.

3177
02:18:02,590 --> 02:18:04,570
Do you know when you're going into those
kinds of,

3178
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:08,140
when you're ill and some of that,
do you get a feeling that if you're a

3179
02:18:08,141 --> 02:18:10,330
good or bad person,
did you get.

3180
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:14,770
Do you get like an ant that like I'm
trying to get a feeling if there's

3181
02:18:14,771 --> 02:18:17,050
things that are bothering you about your
behavior.

3182
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:19,810
You know,
if you're a.

3183
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:23,860
If you have something that's that's
haunting you and maybe with a lot of

3184
02:18:23,861 --> 02:18:26,950
people it really comes down to life
choices,

3185
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:29,260
not just in terms of like their
behavior,

3186
02:18:29,261 --> 02:18:32,650
but even like what they're doing with
for living and how they're living their

3187
02:18:32,651 --> 02:18:35,650
life and sometimes those experiences.

3188
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:38,920
The psychedelic experiences can
highlight these things that are

3189
02:18:38,921 --> 02:18:41,380
bothering you,
but that you're suppressing and then you

3190
02:18:41,381 --> 02:18:42,490
realize like,
oh,

3191
02:18:42,491 --> 02:18:47,491
this a suppressing of these feelings and
thoughts is actually making me lash out

3192
02:18:47,561 --> 02:18:52,561
in these other ways and I've got shitty
behavior and aggressive in this way and

3193
02:18:55,031 --> 02:18:58,000
it's really because of this lab.
It's really because of.

3194
02:18:58,180 --> 02:18:58,941
And then you might,
you know,

3195
02:18:58,941 --> 02:19:02,350
might also come to realization.
It's about something that happened when

3196
02:19:02,351 --> 02:19:06,190
you were a child.
It's about feeling unprotected or

3197
02:19:06,191 --> 02:19:09,670
unloved as a child and it's just,
you never developed properly,

3198
02:19:09,671 --> 02:19:14,020
so you never felt totally secure.
So you want to do something to make you

3199
02:19:14,021 --> 02:19:16,360
feel secure,
whether it's drinking or something.

3200
02:19:16,570 --> 02:19:19,540
And then you'll see that in a
psychedelic experience,

3201
02:19:19,541 --> 02:19:21,250
you'd be able to like see the root of it
better.

3202
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:24,860
Oh Wow.
For a lot of people its cessation of um,

3203
02:19:25,780 --> 02:19:27,890
uh,
of smoking comes from that feeling like,

3204
02:19:27,891 --> 02:19:30,110
oh,
this is killing myself because I hate

3205
02:19:30,111 --> 02:19:30,590
myself.

3206
02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:31,120
Like I'm,
I'm,

3207
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:34,280
I'm literally poisoning myself.
Like how could I not see this?

3208
02:19:34,490 --> 02:19:36,740
And then through having a mushroom
experience,

3209
02:19:36,741 --> 02:19:38,540
they've just completely quit.
Really.

3210
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:40,190
So yeah,
it's a real common one,

3211
02:19:40,550 --> 02:19:42,350
real common ones.
There's a lot of other stuff that I

3212
02:19:42,351 --> 02:19:47,270
haven't done that also like Ibogaine is
a big one for getting people off drugs.

3213
02:19:47,271 --> 02:19:48,920
That's a huge one.
I heard about that.

3214
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:52,290
That's a big one that has an amazing
success rate,

3215
02:19:52,850 --> 02:19:57,850
but it's supposed to be really brutal.
And as far as like how you feel like

3216
02:19:57,950 --> 02:19:59,840
look it,
it runs you through the ringer

3217
02:19:59,841 --> 02:20:02,570
psychologically,
but when you get through it it's worth

3218
02:20:02,571 --> 02:20:04,460
it.
But it's 24 hours.

3219
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:06,350
Fuck.
And who do you have to go with by

3220
02:20:06,351 --> 02:20:09,110
yourself?
So there's a lot of clinics that do it,

3221
02:20:09,111 --> 02:20:11,840
particularly in Mexico.
A lot of people go down to Mexico and go

3222
02:20:11,841 --> 02:20:16,841
to these clinics and their 24 hour
clinics of this Ibogaine experience.

3223
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:19,040
Jre field trip.
But Hey man,

3224
02:20:19,041 --> 02:20:22,420
if you had a son and if you like Joe,
my son is hooked on oxygen,

3225
02:20:22,421 --> 02:20:24,980
I don't know what to do.
I would 100 percent recommend you do

3226
02:20:24,981 --> 02:20:25,670
that.
Really?

3227
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:27,080
Yeah.
Because I know so many people that have

3228
02:20:27,081 --> 02:20:31,040
done it and it's helped them and it
rewires the way your brain connects to

3229
02:20:31,041 --> 02:20:32,780
addiction.
It's really fast.

3230
02:20:32,781 --> 02:20:35,300
It's a fascinating drug.
Hamilton Morris,

3231
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:40,160
who is the host of vices,
Hamilton's Pharmacopia.

3232
02:20:40,161 --> 02:20:43,010
It's a essentially a show that's all
just about drugs.

3233
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:48,170
He was talking about it last week about
how fascinating it is and in low doses

3234
02:20:48,171 --> 02:20:52,190
that actually is like a nootropic.
It actually enhances your consciousness

3235
02:20:52,191 --> 02:20:55,720
and low doses makes you smarter.
Yeah.

3236
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:56,350
Uh,
yeah.

3237
02:20:56,350 --> 02:20:57,183
Uh,
you know,

3238
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,610
uh,
I want to get into some of that kind of

3239
02:20:58,611 --> 02:20:59,230
stuff,
but I mean,

3240
02:20:59,230 --> 02:21:00,063
I,
you know,

3241
02:21:00,110 --> 02:21:01,640
so right now I don't party or anything
like that,

3242
02:21:01,641 --> 02:21:02,630
so I struggle with that.

3243
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:03,463
It's like,
man,

3244
02:21:03,510 --> 02:21:04,640
you know,
because I don't,

3245
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:08,210
you know,
it's tough because I do want to be able

3246
02:21:08,211 --> 02:21:10,820
to be,
do things that are beneficial for myself

3247
02:21:11,090 --> 02:21:12,590
and things that I didn't have a problem
with,

3248
02:21:12,591 --> 02:21:14,210
but it's hard just hard to kind of
balance.

3249
02:21:14,350 --> 02:21:15,560
Yeah.
You want to stay sober.

3250
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:16,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

3251
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:17,091
Well,
you know,

3252
02:21:17,091 --> 02:21:22,091
sobriety is a worthwhile goal and if you
can go from being a person who's doing a

3253
02:21:23,781 --> 02:21:27,320
lot of drugs and ruining their life,
the person who is like yourself that's

3254
02:21:27,321 --> 02:21:29,780
on a great path and you're sober and
you're disciplined,

3255
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:34,100
you wouldn't want to break that.
You don't want to have that bad feeling.

3256
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:36,560
Um,
but there's ways that you can achieve

3257
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:38,660
certain psychedelic states,
uh,

3258
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:41,630
without any drugs.
One of the big ones is yoga and

3259
02:21:41,631 --> 02:21:43,490
meditation.
Those are two big ones.

3260
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:44,363
Yeah.
I mean,

3261
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:48,440
I don't do the kind of yoga that gives
you a psychedelic experience.

3262
02:21:48,530 --> 02:21:52,790
I think mostly that's Kundalini Yoga,
but the kind of yoga that I do,

3263
02:21:52,791 --> 02:21:54,710
um,
that beaker from hot yoga shit,

3264
02:21:54,711 --> 02:21:57,740
it's just this,
this what it does to your body and

3265
02:21:57,741 --> 02:22:01,460
chills you out afterwards.
I think it has a pretty profound effect

3266
02:22:01,461 --> 02:22:05,990
on the way the world,
the way you experience the world after

3267
02:22:05,991 --> 02:22:08,180
the classes.
So I think that's something that people

3268
02:22:08,181 --> 02:22:13,181
don't take into consideration.
Like one way in which you can change the

3269
02:22:13,701 --> 02:22:17,630
world around you is to change how you
interface with the world and how you

3270
02:22:17,631 --> 02:22:19,970
experience the world.
How are you viewing it?

3271
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:23,570
What is your,
what's your behavior of a flavored by?

3272
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:28,600
Is your behavior motivated by
frustration and weirdness and insecurity

3273
02:22:28,831 --> 02:22:33,831
and anger or is your behavior motivated
by love and confidence and happiness and

3274
02:22:35,521 --> 02:22:39,240
are you like,
are you quenched physically?

3275
02:22:39,241 --> 02:22:44,200
Do you feel good physically and if you
do and if you've experienced like a

3276
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:47,700
strong yoga class and then you run into
someone,

3277
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:50,370
you might be more relaxed,
more compassionate,

3278
02:22:50,430 --> 02:22:52,380
more easily,
and that that'll change the way that

3279
02:22:52,381 --> 02:22:53,310
person thinks about you.

3280
02:22:53,310 --> 02:22:55,080
That'll change your interaction with
them in the future.

3281
02:22:55,081 --> 02:22:59,310
That might change your whole life and if
you continue to act that way and you

3282
02:22:59,311 --> 02:23:03,360
continue to look at the world through
the eyes of this very particular

3283
02:23:03,361 --> 02:23:04,830
discipline,
it's really good for your body.

3284
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:07,590
It really can change.
People change a lot of people.

3285
02:23:07,591 --> 02:23:10,380
It's like there's a definite butterfly
effect from that.

3286
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:12,540
Yeah,
so if you want to just do something for

3287
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:13,590
you,
I'm just meditate.

3288
02:23:13,591 --> 02:23:15,370
Men Learn how to meditate.
Yeah.

3289
02:23:15,371 --> 02:23:17,190
I just got a new meditation chair
actually yesterday,

3290
02:23:17,191 --> 02:23:19,860
so I might have to start getting maybe
getting into it too.

3291
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:20,551
Why not,
man?

3292
02:23:20,551 --> 02:23:22,350
I mean,
if you were interested in doing drugs

3293
02:23:22,351 --> 02:23:24,210
right,
why not just be interested in doing

3294
02:23:24,211 --> 02:23:27,500
something that you know you can
definitely do and it's not going to fuck

3295
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:31,860
you up and it's only gonna help you
when you were,

3296
02:23:31,861 --> 02:23:33,510
um,
when you were partying,

3297
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:36,390
what was your thing?
Just doing cocaine by myself at the

3298
02:23:36,391 --> 02:23:37,080
house.
Really?

3299
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:38,760
Cocaine.
It was all cocaine.

3300
02:23:38,870 --> 02:23:40,110
Yeah.
What about Bu's?

3301
02:23:40,170 --> 02:23:41,370
The Bu's bother,
you know,

3302
02:23:41,371 --> 02:23:43,330
I just couldn't have a drink because I'd
be afraid that I would buy.

3303
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:46,530
I would buy a coke.
So if you got drunk then it would loosen

3304
02:23:46,531 --> 02:23:49,500
your inhibitions and you'd be like,
where's the coke with the fucking coke?

3305
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:50,453
Yeah,

3306
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:52,400
dude and cocaine.
Oh,

3307
02:23:52,401 --> 02:23:54,770
go back to that vest or a man.
So here's what happened.

3308
02:23:55,550 --> 02:23:57,100
So I,
you know,

3309
02:23:57,101 --> 02:23:58,790
I would get,
I would do some cocaine at thousand,

3310
02:23:58,791 --> 02:24:00,140
put on these different vests.
I many.

3311
02:24:00,141 --> 02:24:02,660
Did you buy it again?
I don't know.

3312
02:24:02,661 --> 02:24:05,570
I spent too much on them,
but I would probably say

3313
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:10,220
the priciest one I had was probably
about $210.

3314
02:24:10,390 --> 02:24:11,010
Nine.
Damn.

3315
02:24:11,010 --> 02:24:14,240
Yeah.
And so I would get fucked up and put

3316
02:24:14,241 --> 02:24:16,940
these vests on.
And put on sunglasses and not know like

3317
02:24:16,941 --> 02:24:19,280
Buffalo Bill Shit,
but at least party and by myself,

3318
02:24:19,310 --> 02:24:21,620
you know,
and one time I was making a smoothie,

3319
02:24:21,621 --> 02:24:22,311
you know,
because I,

3320
02:24:22,311 --> 02:24:23,144
you know,
I have,

3321
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:25,340
I got like a new unknown what kind of
blender it is,

3322
02:24:25,341 --> 02:24:28,790
but it's pretty nice and I was making
like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking

3323
02:24:28,791 --> 02:24:33,050
coked up on party and you know,
living high on the hog to vests on

3324
02:24:33,051 --> 02:24:33,320
maybe.

3325
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:34,160
Right.
And I thought,

3326
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:36,710
I thought I heard something outside.
Right.

3327
02:24:36,711 --> 02:24:40,100
Which is kind of weird to even think of
when you have a blender going.

3328
02:24:40,101 --> 02:24:42,170
Right?
So I'll leave out of my apartment to go

3329
02:24:42,171 --> 02:24:45,740
in the hallway,
lock myself out with the blender going

3330
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:49,640
in the morning,
coked up out of my brain.

3331
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:55,070
Now I have to go to my landlord dude who
lives right down the hall and tell him

3332
02:24:56,091 --> 02:24:57,110
like,
hey man,

3333
02:24:58,190 --> 02:25:00,270
I got logged out.
Blenders on.

3334
02:25:01,310 --> 02:25:02,990
Oh my God,
he must have hated you.

3335
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:06,110
Owe the blender shorts out and smoke
happens.

3336
02:25:06,410 --> 02:25:09,200
The fire alarm starts going off in the
building,

3337
02:25:09,230 --> 02:25:12,320
right as I'm at his door knocking right
now.

3338
02:25:12,321 --> 02:25:14,360
He's pissed and he's like,
what's going on?

3339
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:18,410
And I didn't know what to say.
I told him that I was throwing a late

3340
02:25:18,530 --> 02:25:19,820
Christmas party.
Dude,

3341
02:25:20,930 --> 02:25:24,030
it was fucking into January.
I will with you

3342
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,120
at the time,
Huh?

3343
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:26,530
Oh,
this is two and half years ago.

3344
02:25:30,730 --> 02:25:32,770
So he comes back to my apartment.
Right?

3345
02:25:32,771 --> 02:25:37,180
He's locks the door.
There's nobody in there.

3346
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:43,150
Oh my God

3347
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:44,600
man.
But that's it.

3348
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:48,110
It was fun.
Oh my God.

3349
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,540
No,
that was fun.

3350
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:53,210
How long have you lived there for?
I still live there.

3351
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:54,913
Yeah,

3352
02:25:55,070 --> 02:25:57,100
passionate.
You know,

3353
02:25:57,250 --> 02:26:02,250
like I've caught him doing some things.
I think we're all even.

3354
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:05,510
How long have you been

3355
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:08,840
sober for a two year.
In two weeks.

3356
02:26:08,841 --> 02:26:11,600
It'll be two years.
What was the big thing where you like,

3357
02:26:11,630 --> 02:26:12,860
oh,
I gotta get my shit together.

3358
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:17,180
Your Dad was going on.
Opie and Jim when Jim Norton had a radio

3359
02:26:17,181 --> 02:26:20,290
show,
it's serious and it was actually on a,

3360
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:23,000
it's on [inaudible] that show that he
had.

3361
02:26:23,001 --> 02:26:24,750
This is not happening.
Um,

3362
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:26,100
and I ended up,
uh,

3363
02:26:26,510 --> 02:26:31,400
doing coke all night driving a taxi.
I was in a taxi driver.

3364
02:26:31,490 --> 02:26:32,600
This dude,
Luigi

3365
02:26:34,250 --> 02:26:37,040
got me an escort,
I didn't want to escort.

3366
02:26:37,041 --> 02:26:41,010
We're doing cocaine and like Harlem or
something North Harlem and the cab

3367
02:26:41,011 --> 02:26:44,510
driver doing coke and I just had,
I was taking a cab from a party to my

3368
02:26:44,511 --> 02:26:47,900
hotel and so we end up off on this other
excursion.

3369
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:49,970
Next thing you know,
I'm driving the taxi,

3370
02:26:49,971 --> 02:26:53,570
he's in the back with the hooker.
It's 5:30 in the morning and I got to be

3371
02:26:53,571 --> 02:26:56,720
on the radio station at 6:30 or
something.

3372
02:26:57,050 --> 02:26:59,240
So I get to the radio and I can't even
talk.

3373
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:03,260
And uh,
and darryl strawberry's the other guest,

3374
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:06,590
right?
Who the baseball player who also had

3375
02:27:06,591 --> 02:27:09,620
drug problem,
but he's like 13 years sober.

3376
02:27:09,621 --> 02:27:11,570
And so it was this weird moment where
like,

3377
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:14,840
I thought I was kind of cool,
but then here's a man who like,

3378
02:27:15,230 --> 02:27:16,820
I'd always in my head maybe somewhere
thought,

3379
02:27:16,821 --> 02:27:19,280
oh,
that caused like a cokehead within here

3380
02:27:19,281 --> 02:27:22,310
he is eloquent,
put together successful.

3381
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:24,140
And here I am,
I can't even talk.

3382
02:27:24,410 --> 02:27:26,640
And I'm with two men that I admire.
Um,

3383
02:27:26,970 --> 02:27:28,010
you know,
opie and Jim Norton.

3384
02:27:28,011 --> 02:27:29,690
Just to be honored and to be on the
show,

3385
02:27:29,691 --> 02:27:30,710
you know,
and so I was like,

3386
02:27:30,711 --> 02:27:31,700
this is,
I'm,

3387
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:34,070
I'm not making choices.
Like there's some,

3388
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:35,930
there's some unevenness here,
you know.

3389
02:27:36,190 --> 02:27:38,480
So what did you do after the 2012 step
programs?

3390
02:27:38,481 --> 02:27:39,800
One 12 step program.
Yeah.

3391
02:27:40,430 --> 02:27:42,740
And then so yeah.
So I've been in that.

3392
02:27:42,741 --> 02:27:44,060
Then since then it,
it's helped me out,

3393
02:27:44,090 --> 02:27:45,260
you know?
Well,

3394
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:48,080
I would definitely say don't do coke.
Yeah.

3395
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:51,380
The problem with drugs is they're all
under the same blanket.

3396
02:27:51,410 --> 02:27:53,600
Right.
You know when someone says drugs,

3397
02:27:53,601 --> 02:27:57,260
you think of everything,
you think of pills,

3398
02:27:57,261 --> 02:27:59,840
you think of smoking it,
you think of coke,

3399
02:27:59,841 --> 02:28:02,450
you think a pot,
you think of mushrooms.

3400
02:28:02,510 --> 02:28:03,680
Think of everything.
Yeah.

3401
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:06,470
But obviously they're not all the same
thing.

3402
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:09,020
You know?
It's weird to call them all drugs.

3403
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:11,270
Yeah.
They affect you very differently.

3404
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:14,390
One hundred percent.
I don't think if you did mushrooms you

3405
02:28:14,391 --> 02:28:17,360
would all of a sudden be doing blow and
know.

3406
02:28:17,390 --> 02:28:19,130
Yeah.
I don't think so either from Luigi cab

3407
02:28:19,131 --> 02:28:19,964
again.
Right?

3408
02:28:19,970 --> 02:28:23,330
I don't think so either so,
but I think I wouldn't want to be the

3409
02:28:23,331 --> 02:28:26,330
guy that told you to do now I don't feel
like you are,

3410
02:28:26,690 --> 02:28:27,231
but,
you know,

3411
02:28:27,231 --> 02:28:31,370
I feel like it's something that I think
about sometimes and um,

3412
02:28:32,150 --> 02:28:32,841
but uh,
you know,

3413
02:28:32,841 --> 02:28:35,750
I don't know because I also do want to
have experiences where like I'm able to

3414
02:28:35,751 --> 02:28:36,650
get,
you know,

3415
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:39,980
unique experiences out of my car,
out of my mind and think about other

3416
02:28:39,981 --> 02:28:41,600
stuff and like,
you know,

3417
02:28:41,601 --> 02:28:44,190
I do remember times where mushrooms
would just clear my conscience.

3418
02:28:44,190 --> 02:28:46,130
They would be like,
someone came up to the chalkboard where

3419
02:28:46,131 --> 02:28:48,810
everybody written all these math
problems and bullshit and somebody's

3420
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:51,500
drawn a dick and uh,
somebody fucking cutting off somebodies

3421
02:28:51,501 --> 02:28:53,780
head,
just stupid shit and just cleaned it all

3422
02:28:53,781 --> 02:28:54,501
off.
And you're like,

3423
02:28:54,501 --> 02:28:55,334
ugh.

3424
02:28:55,470 --> 02:28:56,490
No,
I think so too.

3425
02:28:56,550 --> 02:28:58,350
It was relaxing mushrooms,
forgive you.

3426
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:01,950
We give you free your mistakes.
I mean,

3427
02:29:01,951 --> 02:29:06,951
this is one of the reasons why I'm like,
mushrooms and Jesus are always kind of

3428
02:29:08,431 --> 02:29:13,431
connected in folklore and a lot of
people's ideas because they're both very

3429
02:29:13,831 --> 02:29:15,780
forgiving.
Like,

3430
02:29:17,460 --> 02:29:19,800
here's the best Jesus store.
If someone being forgiving,

3431
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:24,550
God damn coughing while it's the weed.
Um,

3432
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:26,640
there was a guy named general butt
naked.

3433
02:29:26,641 --> 02:29:28,170
You ever heard of that guy?
Real man?

3434
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:31,680
Yeah.
He lived in Liberia and he's a famous

3435
02:29:31,681 --> 02:29:35,460
character in Liberia because of his
exploits.

3436
02:29:35,610 --> 02:29:38,580
When he was in the middle of war,
he would,

3437
02:29:38,581 --> 02:29:42,150
uh,
he would go and fight naked.

3438
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:44,190
Oh Wow.
And he was a cannibal.

3439
02:29:44,191 --> 02:29:48,720
He would kill innocent children on the
other side in eat pieces of their heart.

3440
02:29:49,170 --> 02:29:51,570
And he believed that it would protect
them in battle and talks about it

3441
02:29:51,571 --> 02:29:52,404
openly.

3442
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:57,000
After doing this,
he found Jesus and he came over here.

3443
02:29:57,780 --> 02:30:00,840
He is this him?
Did you have actual photos?

3444
02:30:01,350 --> 02:30:03,000
Photos of him?
I didn't know either.

3445
02:30:04,050 --> 02:30:06,270
So then he became he,
I mean,

3446
02:30:06,271 --> 02:30:08,120
he's killed thousands of people.
Oh,

3447
02:30:08,121 --> 02:30:10,080
he's apparently in,
in war.

3448
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:15,800
And then according to what he said,
and then afterwards became a preacher

3449
02:30:17,130 --> 02:30:21,390
and talks openly about the fact that
he's killed innocent children and eating

3450
02:30:21,391 --> 02:30:26,130
pieces of their heart.
But people forgive him because he's a

3451
02:30:26,131 --> 02:30:31,131
preacher.
So his love of Jesus is so complete that

3452
02:30:31,741 --> 02:30:33,450
people forgive him to the point where
they're.

3453
02:30:33,451 --> 02:30:36,180
Forgive the fact that he ate kids.
Wow.

3454
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:41,280
Imagine how powerful he was.
If he was your.

3455
02:30:42,570 --> 02:30:47,310
It was your kid that this guy eight.
Then you see him out preaching.

3456
02:30:47,311 --> 02:30:49,290
Now I'd be pissed off Bro.
You Ain't my kid.

3457
02:30:49,350 --> 02:30:51,680
Yeah,
it is hard the fuck.

3458
02:30:52,260 --> 02:30:53,780
But there was a different time.
Yeah,

3459
02:30:54,090 --> 02:30:55,350
that was a different man.
Yeah,

3460
02:30:56,010 --> 02:30:57,150
it's crazy.
The,

3461
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:57,960
the,
the.

3462
02:30:57,960 --> 02:30:59,820
For travelers guy.
I forget what it's called,

3463
02:30:59,821 --> 02:31:03,510
the vice travel guide to Liberia.
It is a really,

3464
02:31:05,970 --> 02:31:10,970
really eye opening.
I'm sort of a view into what Liberia is

3465
02:31:11,531 --> 02:31:12,364
like.
Light.

3466
02:31:12,530 --> 02:31:15,210
Liberia is a really,
really poor,

3467
02:31:15,211 --> 02:31:20,211
dangerous part of Africa.
That was originally when slaves

3468
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:22,440
left America,
when they were set free,

3469
02:31:22,441 --> 02:31:25,020
they went back to Liberia and that's
where they settled.

3470
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:27,480
Fuck yeah.
Dude,

3471
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:29,700
I Africa's always fucked up,
huh?

3472
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:32,250
Yeah.
That sucks man.

3473
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:36,500
Yeah.
That's why I'm all these wild animals

3474
02:31:36,501 --> 02:31:38,830
stories from Africa.
And so this is another one that was kind

3475
02:31:38,831 --> 02:31:40,890
of interesting.
These poachers got eaten by a lion.

3476
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:42,480
They,
uh,

3477
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:44,790
tried to get ahold of a rhino.
They were trying to steal,

3478
02:31:44,970 --> 02:31:48,500
kill this rhino and cut it.
Turns off they try to sell them and they

3479
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:53,510
just get eaten.
That's crazy.

3480
02:31:53,611 --> 02:31:55,410
Did too.
That's the way to go.

3481
02:31:55,560 --> 02:31:58,020
If you could get an animal Oregon put
into your body,

3482
02:31:58,021 --> 02:32:01,230
would you do it
will be the benefit.

3483
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:05,700
Would you get I do something.
Would you get like a Hyena?

3484
02:32:05,701 --> 02:32:10,410
But when I'm shiny,
but I already have the blood of a down

3485
02:32:10,411 --> 02:32:12,180
syndrome boy.
I said I don't know what I would get

3486
02:32:12,181 --> 02:32:12,390
mad.

3487
02:32:12,390 --> 02:32:15,180
I would probably get just something.
I'd start off with something small,

3488
02:32:15,181 --> 02:32:16,440
probably like,
you know,

3489
02:32:16,441 --> 02:32:18,740
a wrist or something or like a pinky
nail.

3490
02:32:18,750 --> 02:32:23,750
The Leopard Xal gravy that
once they said splicing genes,

3491
02:32:26,701 --> 02:32:29,130
man,
Dan wants you to be able to do with

3492
02:32:29,131 --> 02:32:30,870
people.
You're going to be like,

3493
02:32:30,871 --> 02:32:32,940
that guy ty grid.
What's that guy on a condo?

3494
02:32:32,950 --> 02:32:34,770
ACAT member.
You're going to be like,

3495
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:36,050
thundercat.
Who's what?

3496
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:38,220
I don't remember that guy with the red
man.

3497
02:32:38,221 --> 02:32:39,420
He was like,
never tried that.

3498
02:32:39,421 --> 02:32:41,710
I know it's definitely illegal,
but do you think there's a scientists

3499
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:43,830
tried.
I met a guy twice in people with

3500
02:32:43,831 --> 02:32:44,371
animals.
Sure.

3501
02:32:44,371 --> 02:32:45,210
Yeah.
Well,

3502
02:32:45,211 --> 02:32:46,770
it wasn't that something that they were
trying.

3503
02:32:46,980 --> 02:32:48,840
Stalin was trying to do that with
chimpanzees.

3504
02:32:48,841 --> 02:32:51,060
Yeah.
He was trying to make some sort of a

3505
02:32:51,061 --> 02:32:52,530
chimp human hybrid.
Yeah,

3506
02:32:53,130 --> 02:32:53,911
I could see it,
man.

3507
02:32:53,911 --> 02:32:56,910
I've met some motherfuckers.
Did some motherfucker.

3508
02:32:59,130 --> 02:33:02,490
Yeah.
Well I think they're going to be able to

3509
02:33:02,491 --> 02:33:04,130
do something like that soon.
Dave,

3510
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:07,860
can you afford that?
You fucking are talking to somebody and

3511
02:33:07,861 --> 02:33:10,980
then they just get into a bird bath.
Can you fucking imagine that?

3512
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:14,940
This is that humanity thing.
Scientists claim US lab engineered to

3513
02:33:14,941 --> 02:33:17,430
Mansi human chimp hybrid.
One hundred years ago.

3514
02:33:17,550 --> 02:33:20,550
Scientist.
This is a really recent article.

3515
02:33:20,551 --> 02:33:23,670
Huh?
This isn't science alert though.

3516
02:33:24,570 --> 02:33:25,800
Oh,
this is the sun.

3517
02:33:25,801 --> 02:33:26,940
Super Sketchy,
right?

3518
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:29,700
Yeah.
That humanity was real weird though.

3519
02:33:29,701 --> 02:33:31,530
The thing walked up right?
A lot.

3520
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:33,630
Yeah,
and they wore a suit.

3521
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:36,240
What is that?
That's,

3522
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:40,710
that's Stalin's humanz experience,
but that one picture is real.

3523
02:33:40,770 --> 02:33:41,880
That one,
that one,

3524
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:43,710
the one next to the one year at that
one.

3525
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:45,630
That's real.
That's what it really looked like

3526
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:48,930
thing.
Walked around with shorts on.

3527
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:52,070
Yeah.
Luda side of his quads on that

3528
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:54,300
motherfucker will tear you apart.

3529
02:33:55,130 --> 02:33:57,240
Yeah.
The thing I think it got very close to

3530
02:33:57,241 --> 02:33:59,930
the woman to which became an issue.
Look at data.

3531
02:34:00,270 --> 02:34:01,890
Who is that?
That's the humanity.

3532
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:06,660
I put tie
Dean Martin's friend.

3533
02:34:07,010 --> 02:34:08,730
Steve Martin's buddy.
Yeah.

3534
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,200
Look,
he's dealing coke with.

3535
02:34:10,201 --> 02:34:13,050
What's his effort is that they got from
Norco to sit in the background,

3536
02:34:15,330 --> 02:34:17,740
but stop looking at that language.
That's what I'm talking about.

3537
02:34:17,741 --> 02:34:19,930
Look at the writing.
Tell me that shit doesn't look alien.

3538
02:34:19,970 --> 02:34:23,980
Like that's from some spaceship.
Like what language is that?

3539
02:34:24,540 --> 02:34:25,420
I don't know.
I'm.

3540
02:34:25,470 --> 02:34:28,840
I'm ready for it all man.
Language was a Japanese.

3541
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:31,810
Yeah.
That looks like it should be on.

3542
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:33,910
Yeah,
don't,

3543
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:36,590
don't go back.
Translate it.

3544
02:34:37,050 --> 02:34:38,950
There we go.
The language looks.

3545
02:34:38,951 --> 02:34:41,260
It does look like.
Like it's from space.

3546
02:34:42,070 --> 02:34:45,250
Like if you saw that on.
He didn't know anything about Asian

3547
02:34:45,251 --> 02:34:47,580
languages.
Do you saw that on a spaceship?

3548
02:34:47,581 --> 02:34:48,550
He'd be like,
Oh,

3549
02:34:48,610 --> 02:34:51,550
do you think Japanese people could be
from space and not know that they are

3550
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:54,700
the people that are really into
nonsense.

3551
02:34:55,750 --> 02:34:59,230
I'm like the Zacharias situation.
Do you know about all that shit?

3552
02:35:00,510 --> 02:35:05,510
There's people that believe that there
is a planet that's out far outside of

3553
02:35:06,251 --> 02:35:10,840
Pluto that comes.
It's an on an elliptical orbit and it

3554
02:35:10,841 --> 02:35:13,420
comes near Earth every like 3000 years
or something.

3555
02:35:13,421 --> 02:35:18,340
I forget the exact number,
but it's called Nibiru and on the bureau

3556
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:22,090
there are these people called the
[inaudible] and what they are is an

3557
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:27,120
alien race and that this alien race
engineered us and they took,

3558
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:34,750
they took these old monkeys like a
ancient hominids and then they added

3559
02:35:34,751 --> 02:35:37,180
their DNA to him and created a human
being.

3560
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,990
This is the idea.
And then the guys,

3561
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:44,910
Zechariah wrote all these books on this
stuff and there's a lot of people that

3562
02:35:44,911 --> 02:35:46,390
think he's full of shit,
but it's interesting.

3563
02:35:46,410 --> 02:35:48,220
It's fun.
It's fun to.

3564
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:50,340
It's fun to speculate,
you know,

3565
02:35:50,410 --> 02:35:54,970
but the idea was that different groups
of people got different level of alien.

3566
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:56,890
Hm.
Yeah.

3567
02:35:56,950 --> 02:35:58,180
I could get will.
Look,

3568
02:35:58,181 --> 02:36:00,010
sometimes I'm talking to somebody,
I'm like,

3569
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:02,110
I don't think this dude's like a full
person.

3570
02:36:02,111 --> 02:36:04,500
You know,
like,

3571
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:05,473
who,
who,

3572
02:36:05,500 --> 02:36:08,700
who do we know?
Don't tell mom.

3573
02:36:09,220 --> 02:36:10,900
I don't know if it's anybody that we
know.

3574
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:13,280
I mean,
Josh Martin,

3575
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:15,550
that works.
Sometimes it takes me for a ride,

3576
02:36:15,551 --> 02:36:18,850
but I don't know it be an alien.
Imagine if there was one just living

3577
02:36:18,851 --> 02:36:20,170
amongst us.
Oh,

3578
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:23,500
the whole time.
We're just getting our chain yanked.

3579
02:36:24,390 --> 02:36:25,001
Oh,
I bet.

3580
02:36:25,001 --> 02:36:27,400
I'm sure there's some chick out there
that's fucked an alien.

3581
02:36:29,080 --> 02:36:33,790
I think when I really think about it,
I think that that would be the first

3582
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:36,400
inbreeding would be a chick would let an
alien fucker.

3583
02:36:36,401 --> 02:36:38,170
Oh,
it would be a dude who fucked an alien

3584
02:36:38,171 --> 02:36:40,720
girl.
Oh No.

3585
02:36:40,721 --> 02:36:44,110
I think now these days there's a.
I could see some women fucking some

3586
02:36:44,111 --> 02:36:44,800
aliens.

3587
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:47,050
Boy,
isn't that some of the folk lore though,

3588
02:36:47,051 --> 02:36:51,910
some of the stories of male alien
abduction or like female aliens that

3589
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,350
seduce them.
Yeah.

3590
02:36:54,070 --> 02:36:55,360
That's how they get your loads,
bro.

3591
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:57,490
Dude.
Species.

3592
02:36:57,550 --> 02:37:01,680
I've been given a free sign.
Natasha Hendrick,

3593
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:02,920
right?
Is that her last name?

3594
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:04,660
Hendrix.
How do you say it?

3595
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:06,570
And stritch.
Hence trich.

3596
02:37:06,830 --> 02:37:10,990
So they said,
how many loads can your body make you?

3597
02:37:10,991 --> 02:37:13,750
She was on fear factor.
She's very nice.

3598
02:37:13,960 --> 02:37:16,010
She's a very nice person.
So really you met her?

3599
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:16,731
Yeah,
she did.

3600
02:37:16,731 --> 02:37:18,200
An episode of fear factor.
Hottest.

3601
02:37:18,690 --> 02:37:22,010
Wow.
Forest Whitaker was in that movie.

3602
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:23,420
Oh,
I love forrest whitaker.

3603
02:37:23,690 --> 02:37:26,870
Damn ghost dog.
I'll listen in the hustler.

3604
02:37:27,230 --> 02:37:31,550
And he's in no last king of Scotland.
He was in the color of money,

3605
02:37:31,610 --> 02:37:34,910
not the hustler.
You know what movie I like is um,

3606
02:37:35,570 --> 02:37:40,570
that movie where they escaped from the
mental health facility and Michael

3607
02:37:41,901 --> 02:37:45,650
Keaton's in it and it's like four dudes
and they go to a baseball game.

3608
02:37:45,651 --> 02:37:46,484
You remember that movie?

3609
02:37:48,540 --> 02:37:51,230
No,
I think it makes me think you probably

3610
02:37:51,231 --> 02:37:52,580
wouldn't be able to make that movie
today.

3611
02:37:52,930 --> 02:37:54,020
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3612
02:37:54,021 --> 02:37:56,180
Because a mental health facility or some
people will be upset.

3613
02:37:56,300 --> 02:38:00,800
Well,
there's always dudes in movies would

3614
02:38:00,801 --> 02:38:05,801
play those guys that would play someone
smart who is mentally challenged.

3615
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:09,620
Oh yeah.
Like that's a common thing dudes would

3616
02:38:09,621 --> 02:38:11,240
always do that.
Didn't Sean Penn play?

3617
02:38:11,241 --> 02:38:14,420
Someone challenged?
Yeah.

3618
02:38:14,770 --> 02:38:19,430
Great movie with Dustin Hoffman.
Did he do it?

3619
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:20,061
Oh,
that's all right.

3620
02:38:20,061 --> 02:38:21,590
Wayne man.
Rosie O'donnell,

3621
02:38:21,620 --> 02:38:23,210
who?
Dustin Hoffman was probably the first

3622
02:38:23,211 --> 02:38:27,260
guy to play a super autistic man.
And he did great.

3623
02:38:27,261 --> 02:38:29,000
Rosie O'donnell did it too,
right?

3624
02:38:29,150 --> 02:38:30,860
I think so,
man.

3625
02:38:30,861 --> 02:38:33,200
That's the last thing you want your
enemies finding out

3626
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:40,070
there to imagine the outtake.
Three days didn't really get my start

3627
02:38:40,071 --> 02:38:41,300
laughing.
Imagine the outtakes.

3628
02:38:41,301 --> 02:38:44,960
If you start laughing,
you monster and nowadays you have to

3629
02:38:44,961 --> 02:38:47,930
have a real person with the disease on
the side of the stage.

3630
02:38:47,931 --> 02:38:49,610
So like the consult.
Yeah.

3631
02:38:50,750 --> 02:38:54,380
What the fuck is that real?
Yeah,

3632
02:38:54,710 --> 02:38:56,060
that's crazy,
man.

3633
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:57,050
Come on.
Really?

3634
02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:01,460
I'm sure you think they're letting you
do that without having somebody there to

3635
02:39:01,461 --> 02:39:03,350
verify if it's legit or not.
Well,

3636
02:39:03,351 --> 02:39:05,190
how would someone verify whether or not
like,

3637
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:07,430
like,
like if someone's going to come up and

3638
02:39:07,431 --> 02:39:08,960
go,
that's not how I do it.

3639
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:11,950
I just thought this is not your thing.
Who is this?

3640
02:39:12,050 --> 02:39:13,370
Rosie?
That's Rosie.

3641
02:39:13,371 --> 02:39:14,204
Let me hear this

3642
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:15,853
ahead.
I like,

3643
02:39:16,470 --> 02:39:19,170
I like Blue Card or green card.

3644
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:19,851
Oh,
that's true.

3645
02:39:19,851 --> 02:39:20,930
I just made that up.

3646
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,310
A bus driver.
You,

3647
02:39:23,311 --> 02:39:24,600
Amanda?
Amanda Funeral.

3648
02:39:25,560 --> 02:39:29,790
Have you been waiting two hours.
Why didn't you wait inside or riding the

3649
02:39:29,791 --> 02:39:33,630
bus with my sister condensate and May I
have your address?

3650
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:34,381
Honestly.
Bath,

3651
02:39:34,381 --> 02:39:36,060
you know,
you just make things harder on yourself.

3652
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:39,850
Buckle up for safety.
Whoa,

3653
02:39:40,370 --> 02:39:42,470
pretty good.
I'm wondering if you could do that movie

3654
02:39:42,471 --> 02:39:45,230
today,
you might not be able to do it like 12

3655
02:39:45,231 --> 02:39:47,660
years ago.
I guess that's a different world,

3656
02:39:47,661 --> 02:39:50,000
man.
It definitely was a different world,

3657
02:39:50,001 --> 02:39:51,860
man.
You can't even barely breathe out there.

3658
02:39:51,870 --> 02:39:53,060
They know it's tough.
Right.

3659
02:39:53,210 --> 02:39:55,510
But dude,
I can't believe I'm going to China and

3660
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:58,190
they're wondering,
you can do anything.

3661
02:39:58,490 --> 02:40:02,270
Can you do anything?
As far as like comedy material trouble.

3662
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:04,280
I mean I just think of all the different
stuff they have.

3663
02:40:04,281 --> 02:40:05,960
The animals are treated differently
there.

3664
02:40:05,990 --> 02:40:06,670
Oh,
that's true.

3665
02:40:06,670 --> 02:40:07,491
You know?
Right.

3666
02:40:07,491 --> 02:40:11,480
But I think you get in trouble if you
google certain websites,

3667
02:40:11,510 --> 02:40:13,630
like they have a different version of
their.

3668
02:40:13,790 --> 02:40:15,780
They're censored.
Yeah.

3669
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:17,460
Yeah.
I'm not gonna do anything drastic like

3670
02:40:17,461 --> 02:40:18,510
that.
Be Crazy.

3671
02:40:18,511 --> 02:40:22,260
You get sensor a billion people.
How the hell did you do that?

3672
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:24,540
That's pretty impressive,
dude.

3673
02:40:24,540 --> 02:40:27,600
I remember going when I was a student,
we went to Cuba when I was a student in

3674
02:40:27,601 --> 02:40:30,660
college right now.
I remember we went to a bookstore and

3675
02:40:30,661 --> 02:40:34,320
all the books just started at like a
certain year and that was it.

3676
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:37,250
Like there was no.
Imagine that,

3677
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:42,320
and it was like in the 19 whatever,
when Castro took over [inaudible].

3678
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:45,630
This is going on today in China,
World Cup,

3679
02:40:45,631 --> 02:40:46,900
kiss,
spark,

3680
02:40:46,901 --> 02:40:49,800
social media,
debate on sexual harassment in China.

3681
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:55,400
Why a male reporter in these two Russian
fans gave him a kiss while he was

3682
02:40:56,191 --> 02:41:00,990
recuperating and it's caused like a
reverse sexual harassment debate and

3683
02:41:00,991 --> 02:41:02,130
transparent.
It's a big deal.

3684
02:41:02,220 --> 02:41:03,120
Wow.
He looks so.

3685
02:41:03,121 --> 02:41:07,620
What's a big deal that in China,
someone like you're not allowed to show

3686
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:10,140
public affection like that.
Is that what the big debate is?

3687
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:12,600
Here's the.
It came after a bunch of female

3688
02:41:12,601 --> 02:41:16,470
journalists have been assaulted and so
they started assaulting the dude the

3689
02:41:16,471 --> 02:41:17,304
other way around.

3690
02:41:18,750 --> 02:41:21,450
I'm going to go out on a limb.
He's going to be okay.

3691
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:24,450
He looks fine.
He looks actually better than kissed on

3692
02:41:24,451 --> 02:41:27,540
the cheek by attractive women.
They're not hurting them.

3693
02:41:27,541 --> 02:41:29,460
They can't rape him.
I think he's going to be okay.

3694
02:41:29,610 --> 02:41:33,540
Let's watch on boy,
get mauled by these hot Russian broads

3695
02:41:34,340 --> 02:41:35,410
here.
Coast wow.

3696
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:36,353
Kiss.
Nope,

3697
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:38,760
nothing,
nothing.

3698
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:40,380
He's fine.
He's laughing.

3699
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:41,910
Okay,
we're done.

3700
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,010
He's laughing.
We're done.

3701
02:41:44,011 --> 02:41:46,380
Stop this.
People are fucking crazy.

3702
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:48,870
The guys laughing,
he thought it was cute.

3703
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:51,210
Yeah.
Why would anybody make a deal out of

3704
02:41:51,211 --> 02:41:52,770
that?
It's a zero tolerance.

3705
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:57,480
That girl literally had a plastic Red
Cup in her hand,

3706
02:41:57,630 --> 02:42:00,810
which is the universal sign for being
fucked up in public.

3707
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:04,080
Have you got that Plastic Red Cup in
your hand?

3708
02:42:04,230 --> 02:42:06,760
That chick's probably lit.
She kissed that guy.

3709
02:42:06,761 --> 02:42:08,130
Yeah.
He thought it was cute.

3710
02:42:08,370 --> 02:42:11,610
They didn't move them around or push
them or assault him.

3711
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:14,490
It was a friendly gesture on the cheek.
This love.

3712
02:42:14,491 --> 02:42:17,580
I think while we trying to shut down
people enjoying each other,

3713
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:19,320
I don't think we are anymore.
I think.

3714
02:42:19,321 --> 02:42:21,960
I think things are actually,
think things are getting in a lot better

3715
02:42:21,961 --> 02:42:24,090
place in it.
Just on in the media.

3716
02:42:24,091 --> 02:42:26,590
It seems like they're not.
Sometimes you know well that,

3717
02:42:26,591 --> 02:42:30,240
that that seemed like the not the fact
that someone's making a big deal out of

3718
02:42:30,241 --> 02:42:31,110
that.
That's true.

3719
02:42:31,230 --> 02:42:33,930
You can't look.
You can't compare that to a bunch of

3720
02:42:33,931 --> 02:42:36,180
guys doing that to a girl.
It's not the same.

3721
02:42:36,450 --> 02:42:38,940
It's not devastating.
The guy's going to be fine.

3722
02:42:39,150 --> 02:42:41,160
It is different.
Men and women are different.

3723
02:42:41,161 --> 02:42:44,670
In that case,
that is a very clear cut case of no one

3724
02:42:44,671 --> 02:42:47,790
got hurt there.
Did they interrupt his broadcast?

3725
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:50,830
Perhaps?
Did they ruin what he was trying to say

3726
02:42:50,870 --> 02:42:51,840
and I don't know what.

3727
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:55,680
He might have had a serious message and
these taught Russian broads come over

3728
02:42:55,681 --> 02:42:59,070
and kiss him on the cheek.
Maybe they fucked up his little project

3729
02:42:59,071 --> 02:43:03,360
and what he's trying to accomplish,
but there's no crime there.

3730
02:43:03,361 --> 02:43:05,820
That's not a crime.
It's not the same.

3731
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:08,130
If there was a bunch of dudes doing that
to a pretty girl,

3732
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:10,860
some gorilla looking fucking football
player,

3733
02:43:11,230 --> 02:43:14,310
fucking corn fed.
Iowa boys came over and kissed her and

3734
02:43:14,311 --> 02:43:15,144
be like,
Ooh,

3735
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:18,370
what are they doing?
You remember when they were trying to

3736
02:43:18,371 --> 02:43:22,000
make it a big deal because Katy Perry
kiss some guy on American idol.

3737
02:43:22,270 --> 02:43:23,051
Yes.
Remember,

3738
02:43:23,051 --> 02:43:25,300
this is like two months ago,
she kissed him.

3739
02:43:25,310 --> 02:43:28,240
Boy never kissed a boy.
She kissed him.

3740
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:29,890
She brought him over and kissed him,
and there was like,

3741
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:32,620
oh,
well what if worth Katy Perry was a man

3742
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:34,310
that was a girl.
She's

3743
02:43:35,830 --> 02:43:38,500
stop.
She's Katy Perry,

3744
02:43:38,770 --> 02:43:41,050
and if that guy is really complained
that Carrie,

3745
02:43:41,080 --> 02:43:46,080
Katy Perry took her kiss my tears for
me.

3746
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:47,590
Dude.
No one's going to love you.

3747
02:43:47,591 --> 02:43:50,080
Shut the fuck up.
If you can't appreciate Katy Perry

3748
02:43:50,081 --> 02:43:52,090
kissing you.
Oh,

3749
02:43:52,120 --> 02:43:55,360
she's pretty.
She was pretty and more people will love

3750
02:43:55,361 --> 02:44:00,361
that man because Katy Perry kissed him.
Idol contestant shuts down Katy Perry.

3751
02:44:02,130 --> 02:44:06,310
He shut down the Katy Perry backlash.
He kissed her to listen.

3752
02:44:06,311 --> 02:44:07,440
Nothing wrong with that.
Looking at,

3753
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:09,960
first of all,
homeys k right Izzy,

3754
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:13,330
look at him.
He could be from Idaho pushing him and

3755
02:44:13,331 --> 02:44:15,290
he fell down.
That is not a male movie.

3756
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:16,510
That's not.
Oh,

3757
02:44:16,511 --> 02:44:17,350
he could be.
Okay.

3758
02:44:18,580 --> 02:44:23,580
It might be that he's avoiding a that
kiss until he really did find the woman

3759
02:44:25,271 --> 02:44:30,271
that made him feel like you wanted to be
kissed and maybe she stole that from

3760
02:44:30,351 --> 02:44:31,130
them.
Yeah.

3761
02:44:31,130 --> 02:44:31,690
See,
right there.

3762
02:44:31,690 --> 02:44:35,140
Right here.
Imagine if a 33 year old male artists

3763
02:44:35,141 --> 02:44:39,340
tricked and 19 year old female or do a
kids like Katy Perry.

3764
02:44:39,460 --> 02:44:41,230
Well,
imagine that's a different thing you

3765
02:44:41,231 --> 02:44:44,900
fuck about you.
Imagine that's a whole different thing.

3766
02:44:45,690 --> 02:44:47,800
I don't pretend to men and women are the
same.

3767
02:44:47,801 --> 02:44:52,060
You fucking assholes.
Imagine a Volkswagen.

3768
02:44:52,061 --> 02:44:53,920
Fuck your stepmom.
You know what I'm saying?

3769
02:44:53,970 --> 02:44:58,970
Oh Dad,
what are we doing?

3770
02:45:00,971 --> 02:45:04,420
This stupid thing,
man.

3771
02:45:04,421 --> 02:45:08,860
It's just not the same thing.
Everybody's okay.

3772
02:45:08,861 --> 02:45:10,900
That Chinese guy was laughing,
man.

3773
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:12,730
Oh,
he probably jerked off to the video at

3774
02:45:12,731 --> 02:45:14,500
the house multiple times.

3775
02:45:16,570 --> 02:45:18,340
Did I am going to fucking China to ask
them?

3776
02:45:18,430 --> 02:45:20,200
Somebody told me a different fruit over
there.

3777
02:45:20,650 --> 02:45:21,770
Can you could imagine that?
Sure.

3778
02:45:21,890 --> 02:45:24,700
They have different fruit in Brazil.
They have different fruit in England.

3779
02:45:24,730 --> 02:45:26,760
You get some different fruit.
Fuck man.

3780
02:45:26,761 --> 02:45:28,420
I'm excited.
I'm excited.

3781
02:45:28,421 --> 02:45:30,340
I guess I'm nervous,
but I'm also excited.

3782
02:45:30,370 --> 02:45:33,250
How many shows are you doing over there?
I'm doing three shows,

3783
02:45:33,251 --> 02:45:34,960
but you know,
uh,

3784
02:45:35,350 --> 02:45:36,300
and I've,
you know,

3785
02:45:36,310 --> 02:45:39,340
I don't know about the.
Promote a guy hit me up literally over

3786
02:45:39,341 --> 02:45:40,600
email and like,
oh wow,

3787
02:45:41,370 --> 02:45:42,580
I'm going.
But next thing you know,

3788
02:45:42,581 --> 02:45:45,010
you've got a ball.
Gag mouth tied up in a basement,

3789
02:45:45,011 --> 02:45:50,011
under a noodle shop somewhere.
As long as I get to eat after Jesus

3790
02:45:50,290 --> 02:45:51,520
Christ.
Are you looking forward to the food?

3791
02:45:52,210 --> 02:45:53,230
No,
man,

3792
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:53,621
no.
Do you?

3793
02:45:53,621 --> 02:45:55,480
Not like Chinese food,
I mean not like it,

3794
02:45:55,500 --> 02:45:58,480
but somebody told me that you can eat
animal dicks over there.

3795
02:45:58,481 --> 02:46:01,690
You can eat fucking elbow.
You were saying that you need human

3796
02:46:01,691 --> 02:46:03,250
dirks.
I think you were just joking around

3797
02:46:03,251 --> 02:46:04,084
though,
right?

3798
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:06,040
I don't know honestly.
Think about it.

3799
02:46:06,550 --> 02:46:08,320
Think what else.
You went over there and they said,

3800
02:46:08,500 --> 02:46:13,500
we heard you on Joe Rogan experience and
we have a hockey rink and we're prepared

3801
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:18,740
to put on the lion fight.
Are you prepared to watch?

3802
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:21,620
Would if they brought to you to a place
and I said,

3803
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:23,570
Dude's gonna.
Fight a line with a sword.

3804
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:25,630
You could leave if you like.
Yeah.

3805
02:46:25,730 --> 02:46:26,563
Would you stay?

3806
02:46:28,670 --> 02:46:30,590
I would say yeah,
you'd have to.

3807
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:33,590
I would owe it to them.
If the man's already gonna fight and I'm

3808
02:46:33,591 --> 02:46:35,510
the only.
Well imagine he comes out to fight a

3809
02:46:35,511 --> 02:46:37,670
minute.
Nobody's hitting the fucking stadium.

3810
02:46:38,060 --> 02:46:41,930
Well,
you would have to be able to trust the

3811
02:46:41,931 --> 02:46:45,930
people that are there that they're going
to let this guy get ripped apart by line

3812
02:46:45,950 --> 02:46:47,840
in front of you and then they get rid of
a body.

3813
02:46:48,140 --> 02:46:50,120
Yeah.
Would you eat during it or would you

3814
02:46:50,121 --> 02:46:51,020
wait to eat after?

3815
02:46:52,940 --> 02:46:55,490
Gosh,
it depends on how hungry I was thinking.

3816
02:46:55,650 --> 02:46:56,600
Wait.
Yeah.

3817
02:46:56,980 --> 02:46:59,020
If they got looks over and you're
fucking eating,

3818
02:46:59,290 --> 02:47:02,090
holly's fighting for eating a hot dog.
What?

3819
02:47:02,091 --> 02:47:04,480
This guy's getting mauled and he looks
up at you.

3820
02:47:04,481 --> 02:47:08,670
Makes eye contact like
you were just saying,

3821
02:47:09,570 --> 02:47:13,000
muster on your face and shit.
Like what is it?

3822
02:47:13,360 --> 02:47:18,040
Sour Kraut and your teeth
drinking a beer fall.

3823
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:20,170
Fuck his head.
Oh Jesus.

3824
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:24,520
Bartender do that.
When you think about that movie

3825
02:47:24,521 --> 02:47:27,940
gladiator with Russell Crowe.
What is that supposed to be?

3826
02:47:27,941 --> 02:47:30,700
How long ago was that?
Was it supposedly based?

3827
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:32,690
That was like a thousand years ago or
more.

3828
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:36,340
I think it was like 980.
I'm guessing more to let's go.

3829
02:47:36,341 --> 02:47:38,710
2,000 [inaudible].
That ain't shit dude.

3830
02:47:38,711 --> 02:47:41,680
That ain't that long.
Says it's set in Roman times.

3831
02:47:41,681 --> 02:47:44,450
So could we get back there you think was
exactly.

3832
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:46,830
Yeah.
Thanks man.

3833
02:47:46,970 --> 02:47:51,970
Says that's not that long ago.
The people were fucking 8,100.

3834
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:57,320
One 81 88.
I was in Rome a couple of years back and

3835
02:47:57,411 --> 02:47:59,770
I went to the coliseum.
It's fucking amazing,

3836
02:47:59,771 --> 02:48:01,990
man.
It's crazy to be there just to feel it

3837
02:48:02,440 --> 02:48:07,060
and then most of it's missing like they
stripped down a lot of the stone people

3838
02:48:07,061 --> 02:48:10,540
stole things from it and it's like it's
all dilapidated and falling apart,

3839
02:48:10,541 --> 02:48:12,370
but they go on a tour,
Louis,

3840
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:15,400
they take you through the catacombs and
they sort of explained all the different

3841
02:48:15,401 --> 02:48:17,860
things,
but they had these animals they'd gotten

3842
02:48:17,861 --> 02:48:22,120
from Africa and they had kept them in
the see that hole in the ground.

3843
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:24,730
That's really real.
That's really how they did it,

3844
02:48:24,731 --> 02:48:26,890
man.
These animals would come out out of a

3845
02:48:26,891 --> 02:48:30,370
fucking hole in the ground and you see
that first layer of people,

3846
02:48:30,430 --> 02:48:32,590
the first seat,
the first row seats,

3847
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:36,580
they had to put up fucking fences.
It's shit because the Tigers would leap

3848
02:48:36,581 --> 02:48:39,430
through the hair and kill the people
that were in the first row.

3849
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:43,900
Stub hub
people up those stubhub,

3850
02:48:44,290 --> 02:48:49,290
those season pass holders.
Imagine you get that Nice ticket and you

3851
02:48:49,721 --> 02:48:52,870
fucked your buddy.
You Get up to get a soda and you come

3852
02:48:52,871 --> 02:48:55,590
back and your buddies just in pieces do
that.

3853
02:48:55,990 --> 02:48:59,440
Just the fact that people did do stuff
like that.

3854
02:48:59,890 --> 02:49:01,570
We did that.
It's in us.

3855
02:49:01,571 --> 02:49:03,640
Do you know that?
That's what's crazy,

3856
02:49:03,641 --> 02:49:04,960
man.
That's what your show makes me think

3857
02:49:04,961 --> 02:49:05,771
about.
Stuff like that.

3858
02:49:05,771 --> 02:49:09,390
Like that.
There's DNA inside of us that remembers

3859
02:49:09,391 --> 02:49:09,901
that.
Well,

3860
02:49:09,901 --> 02:49:14,250
I think when people get into situations
where they need entertainment and back

3861
02:49:14,251 --> 02:49:16,680
then right,
like would you rather go to a play or

3862
02:49:16,681 --> 02:49:18,810
see a dude have a sword fight against
the tiger.

3863
02:49:20,190 --> 02:49:21,360
Tiger?
Yeah.

3864
02:49:21,510 --> 02:49:23,400
All Day.
Depends on what plays are.

3865
02:49:23,460 --> 02:49:28,410
Boring couple plays will be good.
I mean what,

3866
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:29,990
what?
Playing Neverland.

3867
02:49:30,030 --> 02:49:33,240
Maybe if you.
I mean if there's a line and on the left

3868
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:37,980
you get to see a guy fight align with a
sword and on the right you see a bunch

3869
02:49:37,981 --> 02:49:39,000
of people pretend to be cast.

3870
02:49:42,690 --> 02:49:46,950
That's going to say a lot about humanity
salesman or whatever the fuck you going

3871
02:49:46,951 --> 02:49:47,790
to watch,
bitch,

3872
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:50,810
I'm going to go see that guy get eaten.
You gotta watch it.

3873
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:52,370
It's terrifying to watch.
But the,

3874
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:57,840
the shock and the,
the just the entertainment value before

3875
02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:03,640
death of
the fights we.

3876
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:06,780
Yeah,
we got tickets to be the worst.

3877
02:50:06,890 --> 02:50:09,090
The good stories have been written yet,
so what the hell do you think they were

3878
02:50:09,091 --> 02:50:10,360
doing?
They had plays,

3879
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:15,150
they had great stories and I'm sure they
had great stories but just not as good

3880
02:50:15,560 --> 02:50:20,010
like and also the value of human life
was so much lower than people were

3881
02:50:20,011 --> 02:50:22,470
constantly going to war and the war that
they fought,

3882
02:50:22,471 --> 02:50:25,110
they fought with bows and arrows and
spears and swords.

3883
02:50:25,470 --> 02:50:28,830
So there's just bloodiness horrible
bloodiness.

3884
02:50:28,850 --> 02:50:31,770
There's probably four or five dead
people on the street at the moment.

3885
02:50:31,771 --> 02:50:32,940
So you.
So maybe you're like,

3886
02:50:32,941 --> 02:50:36,780
am I going to go see somebody else die
in there and we see this play and part

3887
02:50:36,781 --> 02:50:39,410
of the problem was the way they got rid
of this shit too,

3888
02:50:39,450 --> 02:50:41,670
right?
Like the streets would be contaminated

3889
02:50:41,671 --> 02:50:45,560
with shit should have buried it like we
did around my neighborhood.

3890
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:53,340
Imagine the blow back.
If someone in some country did put

3891
02:50:53,341 --> 02:50:56,700
together a coliseum and then people
started traveling there and it became

3892
02:50:56,701 --> 02:51:00,360
like the new hot spot.
Well if I lived in Africa I would do

3893
02:51:00,361 --> 02:51:01,700
that because it's,
you know,

3894
02:51:01,710 --> 02:51:04,350
I know that some places are so starved.
They have so many animals.

3895
02:51:04,650 --> 02:51:06,750
I think they have a lot of people
believe in reincarnation.

3896
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:09,930
Well,
we'll just do it a million dollars to

3897
02:51:09,931 --> 02:51:13,560
have a sword fight.
If you had a purse of a million dollars

3898
02:51:13,800 --> 02:51:15,410
for someone,
have a sword fight in the.

3899
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:19,680
Give him a shield and armor and a sword
and a helmet.

3900
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:22,170
They're going to have a sword fight with
a tiger.

3901
02:51:23,490 --> 02:51:25,430
People would sign up for that.
I mean,

3902
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:28,310
I feel like if you had known was better
than anybody because you guys spend,

3903
02:51:28,350 --> 02:51:30,650
you spend more time around,
you know,

3904
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:33,480
the closest kind of thing.
Maybe we have some type of gladiators.

3905
02:51:33,540 --> 02:51:35,820
Modern Day.
What do you think?

3906
02:51:35,821 --> 02:51:37,650
Would any of those men do it?
Yeah.

3907
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:39,570
Yeah.
People would do it.

3908
02:51:39,810 --> 02:51:44,700
What does this Jamie in 2011 man fights
lion to boost Egypt.

3909
02:51:44,701 --> 02:51:45,750
Tourism.
What?

3910
02:51:46,590 --> 02:51:48,540
Come on.
Come on.

3911
02:51:48,870 --> 02:51:50,850
This is real.
Sitting in there with a little plastic

3912
02:51:50,851 --> 02:51:52,530
lawn chair.
It's got a shield.

3913
02:51:52,780 --> 02:51:55,410
It's got a spear and shield as shady as
fuck.

3914
02:51:55,450 --> 02:51:56,730
What the fuck,
dude?

3915
02:51:57,740 --> 02:51:58,960
Hell yeah.
A lot of room.

3916
02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:01,010
Either.
Not a giant line.

3917
02:52:03,220 --> 02:52:04,920
Is this?
This actually happened.

3918
02:52:05,810 --> 02:52:09,700
It says 100 percent live like recorded
videos on CBS news.

3919
02:52:09,970 --> 02:52:14,680
Jesus Christ.
This guy get jacked or what isn't.

3920
02:52:15,070 --> 02:52:18,620
That's not showing it.
It must have been a long fight and it

3921
02:52:18,630 --> 02:52:22,010
was probably subdued.
Oh,

3922
02:52:22,280 --> 02:52:24,040
be a tap.
It's obviously happening.

3923
02:52:24,220 --> 02:52:26,310
If this guy recorded,
then it's probably happened.

3924
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:29,590
He had to do like a two minutes or
something with it a bit.

3925
02:52:29,980 --> 02:52:31,540
Yeah,
the line seems fine.

3926
02:52:33,020 --> 02:52:35,650
He's going to climb on top.
He's a wrestler.

3927
02:52:36,870 --> 02:52:38,590
Yeah.
He's going to do like a fucking cage

3928
02:52:38,591 --> 02:52:40,780
drop.
Drop down on that line.

3929
02:52:40,890 --> 02:52:45,670
You imagine that the ball's.
You'd have to leap down with a spear and

3930
02:52:45,671 --> 02:52:50,671
drive it through the lions brain
from the top rope

3931
02:52:55,230 --> 02:52:56,980
play.
Spray all over the place.

3932
02:52:57,100 --> 02:52:59,470
You could do it.
Someone would do it.

3933
02:52:59,490 --> 02:53:01,750
If that dummy got in there with that
lion you.

3934
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:04,420
He could definitely get.
If you gave someone a million dollars,

3935
02:53:04,770 --> 02:53:07,930
he gave them a shield and a sword in
armor.

3936
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:09,920
Given some armor.
Not all armor.

3937
02:53:13,380 --> 02:53:17,770
You can pick the neck of the loin piece
at lion would leap on you so fast.

3938
02:53:17,771 --> 02:53:19,780
You're sore to be knocked out of your
hand.

3939
02:53:19,781 --> 02:53:22,320
It would just crush your fucking head
with its teeth.

3940
02:53:22,330 --> 02:53:23,500
Well,
one man would do it.

3941
02:53:23,740 --> 02:53:26,080
Yeah.
One man would win

3942
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:32,080
maybe the mountain from game of thrones.
The giant dude.

3943
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:34,690
Yeah.
Give that guy like a battleax,

3944
02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:39,960
like a fucking 85 pound acts.
Who would do it in UFC?

3945
02:53:42,791 --> 02:53:44,860
Who would.
Who Do you think could win

3946
02:53:46,560 --> 02:53:48,670
and it's not saying that that the
greatest or the best,

3947
02:53:48,671 --> 02:53:51,670
but who could do that would have to be
the biggest guys who don't have to be

3948
02:53:51,671 --> 02:53:54,550
like the heavyweight champ.
There'd have to be steep meo chick or

3949
02:53:54,551 --> 02:53:59,320
Francis in Ghana or someone giant who'd
have to be a big powerful person because

3950
02:53:59,321 --> 02:54:02,560
you'd have to be able to swing that
fucking sword fast and you have to be

3951
02:54:02,561 --> 02:54:05,740
able to take a hit from a 500 pound cat.

3952
02:54:06,460 --> 02:54:08,350
You're probably gonna get fucked up
either way though.

3953
02:54:08,380 --> 02:54:10,620
You need one.
You may be able to take one good hit.

3954
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:14,440
You're going to take one good hit my
just to feel like you're just going to

3955
02:54:14,441 --> 02:54:16,900
get fucked up.
Don't think you have a chance.

3956
02:54:16,901 --> 02:54:19,210
There's a lot of debates about this.
When I was reading it earlier,

3957
02:54:19,211 --> 02:54:21,440
of course people's,
a lot of people just as stupid as mean

3958
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:25,060
Theo.
The line wouldn't have a good technique

3959
02:54:25,061 --> 02:54:27,640
so you can fuck it up.
It doesn't matter if it has good

3960
02:54:27,641 --> 02:54:30,220
technique.
The physical power of a lion,

3961
02:54:30,221 --> 02:54:31,850
it's just so overwhelming.
I don't.

3962
02:54:31,990 --> 02:54:35,710
I just don't think people understand how
much force it can generate,

3963
02:54:35,740 --> 02:54:38,260
how quickly it can move,
how quickly he could get you.

3964
02:54:38,261 --> 02:54:40,750
It'd be.
It would just fucking scramble on you

3965
02:54:40,751 --> 02:54:43,960
and it will be on you so fast.
Dude,

3966
02:54:43,990 --> 02:54:47,410
there's a video,
hilarious video of a bunch of dudes

3967
02:54:47,411 --> 02:54:48,050
running away.

3968
02:54:48,050 --> 02:54:52,180
One in comparison.
A leopard is 150 pounds or something

3969
02:54:52,181 --> 02:54:57,010
like that and these fucking people are
running left and right and this thing's

3970
02:54:57,011 --> 02:54:59,860
coming after them and you realize like,
oh my God,

3971
02:54:59,950 --> 02:55:00,730
like,
look at this,

3972
02:55:00,730 --> 02:55:03,040
this guy running.
Now watch the leper.

3973
02:55:03,050 --> 02:55:04,280
Take the corner.
Look,

3974
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:08,810
just look at his slides.
The leopard is going so fast.

3975
02:55:08,811 --> 02:55:13,430
It's running on the walls on the top,
like the middle of the wall,

3976
02:55:13,431 --> 02:55:15,800
above his fucking head.
Watch.

3977
02:55:15,801 --> 02:55:18,860
How has he starts running forward and
the leopard comes into the picture?

3978
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:23,240
The leopard is literally running on a
vertical wall,

3979
02:55:24,080 --> 02:55:26,060
like watch this.
Watch when it comes around the corner,

3980
02:55:26,570 --> 02:55:29,930
look at this.
It's running on the wall.

3981
02:55:30,350 --> 02:55:35,350
It's got so much power that it's running
on the side of the wall like you can't

3982
02:55:36,471 --> 02:55:41,240
even imagine the kind of physical speed
and strength that that thing has in its

3983
02:55:41,241 --> 02:55:41,990
body.

3984
02:55:41,990 --> 02:55:45,530
It's bouncing from the side of the wall
to the other side of the wall and just

3985
02:55:45,650 --> 02:55:49,790
trying to get some traction so we could
get ahold of your bitch ass way to get

3986
02:55:49,791 --> 02:55:51,610
ahold of your bitch ass.
You don't have a chance.

3987
02:55:51,620 --> 02:55:55,850
That thing that's a fraction of the size
of a lion.

3988
02:55:56,360 --> 02:55:59,030
Just a fraction.
Fuck man.

3989
02:55:59,360 --> 02:56:03,470
Oh Jesus Christ school.
Oh God.

3990
02:56:04,130 --> 02:56:05,630
This is a video game,
isn't it?

3991
02:56:05,720 --> 02:56:07,610
Look at it.
Climb over the top of that fence like it

3992
02:56:07,611 --> 02:56:09,770
ain't shit.
It's one of those video games on the

3993
02:56:09,771 --> 02:56:10,700
dark web.
I think

3994
02:56:12,310 --> 02:56:14,600
middle school leopard,
dude.

3995
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:16,580
You find that thing.
You just get to shoot it.

3996
02:56:17,300 --> 02:56:19,310
You just got to shoot it.
There's not much you could do.

3997
02:56:19,430 --> 02:56:20,630
Oh,
it's fucking this dude up.

3998
02:56:20,690 --> 02:56:22,170
Oh Jesus.
Oh,

3999
02:56:22,690 --> 02:56:25,540
oh my God.
Board

4000
02:56:27,560 --> 02:56:28,371
it.
Just bit them.

4001
02:56:28,371 --> 02:56:30,890
And then ran off.
He got lucky.

4002
02:56:33,170 --> 02:56:37,280
He got lucky that there was all those
other people and the commotion and 4

4003
02:56:37,280 --> 02:56:38,500
million people have watched that.
So would it.

4004
02:56:38,630 --> 02:56:43,190
So as,
as people were ready to see that 4

4005
02:56:43,190 --> 02:56:46,070
million people who have safely.
Why Shad and they're not crying at a

4006
02:56:46,071 --> 02:56:48,630
center right now or anything like that.
You have.

4007
02:56:48,631 --> 02:56:50,810
But watching that doesn't seem real.
You know,

4008
02:56:50,811 --> 02:56:53,810
we watched that.
If you were there in real life,

4009
02:56:54,410 --> 02:56:59,330
like if you're in the hockey rink,
sit in those excellent Goldstar seats

4010
02:56:59,360 --> 02:57:01,750
were in Mexico.
I think you're in China somewhere.

4011
02:57:01,890 --> 02:57:03,650
Yeah,
but they have been doing that in China.

4012
02:57:03,710 --> 02:57:07,030
Is this how I got the guy or not?
This one here.

4013
02:57:07,160 --> 02:57:09,580
Hold on.
Oh Wow.

4014
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:14,830
Coming around here.
Try to climb the fence and.

4015
02:57:15,530 --> 02:57:16,450
Gotcha.
Wow.

4016
02:57:16,840 --> 02:57:18,280
Look at.
Dragged him down.

4017
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:20,740
Oh my God.
What do you do?

4018
02:57:21,190 --> 02:57:23,410
It just wants to get out.
It doesn't know what it wants.

4019
02:57:25,300 --> 02:57:28,120
It doesn't know what the fuck it wants
to jump in.

4020
02:57:28,121 --> 02:57:30,280
The water didn't think they swim.
Swim.

4021
02:57:30,340 --> 02:57:31,180
Oh,
well that's not good.

4022
02:57:31,181 --> 02:57:32,830
I think he's bleeding or not.
Oh yeah.

4023
02:57:32,831 --> 02:57:34,300
He's getting his legs,
his arms,

4024
02:57:34,301 --> 02:57:35,650
his legs,
everything's getting torn up.

4025
02:57:35,680 --> 02:57:37,060
All that shit's on the ground.
That's blood.

4026
02:57:37,480 --> 02:57:39,910
It's his blood.
I don't want that on there.

4027
02:57:39,911 --> 02:57:42,880
We definitely don't want that.
I just think we really need to

4028
02:57:42,881 --> 02:57:46,870
understand when you talk,
you're talking about a large predatory

4029
02:57:46,871 --> 02:57:49,420
animals really need to understand what
bitches we are.

4030
02:57:50,350 --> 02:57:55,000
The toughest men that's ever lived is a
weak ass bitch compared to a leopard.

4031
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:59,110
Just the fact that,
oh Jesus,

4032
02:58:01,380 --> 02:58:03,810
fuck man,
who's doing all this?

4033
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:05,640
Oh,
I've seen this one.

4034
02:58:05,640 --> 02:58:06,810
This is in India,
right?

4035
02:58:07,240 --> 02:58:09,330
What happens in these areas,
man,

4036
02:58:09,331 --> 02:58:11,580
these cats,
they get into these villages and just

4037
02:58:11,581 --> 02:58:14,760
start fucking people up.
It's so crazy.

4038
02:58:14,761 --> 02:58:18,930
Imagine that as a small animal compared
to align in comparison.

4039
02:58:21,470 --> 02:58:24,260
Anything else you before we wrap this
bitch up and bring it home?

4040
02:58:25,070 --> 02:58:27,470
I think I've seen enough today.
Well,

4041
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:30,290
you realize that,
uh,

4042
02:58:30,350 --> 02:58:32,930
if you're ever in a confrontation,
one of those animals,

4043
02:58:34,280 --> 02:58:37,730
that's going to be difficult.
Do you realize that you have that in

4044
02:58:37,731 --> 02:58:39,530
your mind now?
Yeah,

4045
02:58:39,770 --> 02:58:43,490
I think it's not a game as much as I
thought it was more of a game.

4046
02:58:44,170 --> 02:58:44,931
Well,
I think this,

4047
02:58:44,931 --> 02:58:48,080
I think it would be neat to go out and
hunt some type of an animal with a knife

4048
02:58:48,120 --> 02:58:52,340
to start to get my Garda hunt an animal
with a knife.

4049
02:58:52,600 --> 02:58:54,320
Do you think you could even have a
raccoon with a knife?

4050
02:58:54,860 --> 02:58:58,100
Yeah.
Do you think you could 150 percent,

4051
02:58:58,370 --> 02:59:00,110
do you think they recommend might fuck
you up though?

4052
02:59:00,680 --> 02:59:04,820
Fuck no man.
How quick do you think a raccoon moves?

4053
02:59:05,240 --> 02:59:08,500
Like if you don't get that first stab
into that,

4054
02:59:08,680 --> 02:59:12,050
that you do that double up.
How long do you think it takes for that

4055
02:59:12,051 --> 02:59:14,930
thing?
Is latched a hold of your face cloth on

4056
02:59:14,931 --> 02:59:17,530
your eyeballs,
out of your fucking head and you're

4057
02:59:17,590 --> 02:59:22,250
feeling your eyeballs getting socked out
of your skull because it tears through

4058
02:59:22,251 --> 02:59:23,570
your tissue paper.

4059
02:59:23,570 --> 02:59:26,810
Thin eyelids,
like they're nothing and it just biting

4060
02:59:27,100 --> 02:59:28,940
man.
Chewing your eyes out.

4061
02:59:28,970 --> 02:59:31,910
No,
I think if it got on,

4062
02:59:31,911 --> 02:59:33,800
you will do.
The tough part is if it gets on you,

4063
02:59:33,801 --> 02:59:35,840
you can't stab it because you'll stab
yourself.

4064
02:59:35,841 --> 02:59:38,950
This is Kevin rose is Kevin rose,
got a raccoon,

4065
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,380
chucked it down the stairs.
Did he?

4066
02:59:41,480 --> 02:59:42,171
Yeah,
he fucked that.

4067
02:59:42,171 --> 02:59:44,060
Recognize the record was fucking his dog
up.

4068
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:46,880
That's a guy who loves his dog.
He said he didn't even realize he was

4069
02:59:46,881 --> 02:59:48,560
doing it.
He was just doing it before he even knew

4070
02:59:48,561 --> 02:59:50,090
it was happening.
But look how he did it.

4071
02:59:50,260 --> 02:59:52,640
He hooked it like a,
like a pillow,

4072
02:59:52,760 --> 02:59:55,220
woof pitch.
Bam.

4073
02:59:55,580 --> 02:59:58,940
Damn.
We went after it.

4074
02:59:59,630 --> 03:00:02,150
Gangster.
I'd go out there with a gangster.

4075
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:03,450
Yeah.
Well,

4076
03:00:03,460 --> 03:00:04,340
it's probably,
like you said,

4077
03:00:04,341 --> 03:00:08,330
it's just a natural instinct.
That's the basic instinct of a man,

4078
03:00:08,331 --> 03:00:08,890
you know.

4079
03:00:08,890 --> 03:00:11,360
Well,
what I was saying was with those guys

4080
03:00:11,361 --> 03:00:13,850
we're talking about when they
encountered that grizzly bear that you

4081
03:00:13,851 --> 03:00:18,851
just,
you reached this survival mode and you

4082
03:00:19,220 --> 03:00:24,140
have your regular operating system and
then there's survival default mode when

4083
03:00:24,141 --> 03:00:27,410
some real shit goes down like a fucking
grizzly bears right next to you.

4084
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:29,000
Well,
I would hate that.

4085
03:00:29,150 --> 03:00:30,140
It will.
I think that,

4086
03:00:30,160 --> 03:00:31,610
you know,
going back to like what we were saying

4087
03:00:31,611 --> 03:00:34,040
earlier,
like that's the moment you'd find out

4088
03:00:34,041 --> 03:00:38,270
who you are and I would hate to find out
at that moment that I'm not a fighter,

4089
03:00:38,300 --> 03:00:39,500
you know,
well that,

4090
03:00:39,580 --> 03:00:41,450
that all could be built up,
right?

4091
03:00:41,810 --> 03:00:44,270
You can build that up through martial
arts that you like.

4092
03:00:44,360 --> 03:00:49,310
There's people that are just naturally
inclined to never quit and then there's

4093
03:00:49,311 --> 03:00:51,500
people that have to learn it,
but you can learn it.

4094
03:00:51,640 --> 03:00:52,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

4095
03:00:52,540 --> 03:00:55,580
I want to start learning some of it to
have just a little bit more that I'm

4096
03:00:56,090 --> 03:00:59,000
just to fill in whatever that space
inside of me and sometimes that feels a

4097
03:00:59,170 --> 03:01:00,100
bit inferior.
I don't

4098
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:03,340
need to feel
invincible,

4099
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:04,240
invincible.
No,

4100
03:01:04,300 --> 03:01:06,940
but I do.
I wouldn't mind getting a little call in

4101
03:01:06,941 --> 03:01:08,740
some of those areas where it's like,
okay,

4102
03:01:08,741 --> 03:01:11,200
if somebody grabs me like I,
I know that I'll be able to grab them

4103
03:01:11,201 --> 03:01:12,400
back.
Yeah,

4104
03:01:12,401 --> 03:01:13,800
man,
take Jujitsu.

4105
03:01:13,810 --> 03:01:16,270
It's easy.
You already know Eddie.

4106
03:01:16,450 --> 03:01:17,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

4107
03:01:17,170 --> 03:01:18,370
Why not,
man to fun?

4108
03:01:18,670 --> 03:01:20,620
Take some beginner classes.
Start slow.

4109
03:01:20,650 --> 03:01:22,750
It's fun to man.
You really enjoy it.

4110
03:01:22,930 --> 03:01:25,240
As long as you're a healthy guy,
like mentally,

4111
03:01:25,241 --> 03:01:29,560
like as far as your ego,
so long as you don't try to not tap.

4112
03:01:30,130 --> 03:01:30,761
Yeah.
No,

4113
03:01:30,761 --> 03:01:31,610
I don't need to.
When I.

4114
03:01:31,611 --> 03:01:33,220
I've just been.
I think I'd be happy to have the

4115
03:01:33,221 --> 03:01:36,940
comradery and that would be.
I think the tapping is probably some

4116
03:01:36,941 --> 03:01:38,560
humility.
That's probably good for you.

4117
03:01:38,630 --> 03:01:40,570
It is definitely.
It's just hard to do.

4118
03:01:41,170 --> 03:01:45,730
Especially when you're in the beginning
you'll try to resist and try to resist

4119
03:01:45,731 --> 03:01:48,010
an arm bar that maybe you should tap and
you can get hurt.

4120
03:01:48,430 --> 03:01:50,740
That's how you can get hurt.
You get hurt from not tapping.

4121
03:01:50,770 --> 03:01:54,550
Especially other beginners.
They don't know how hard like a black

4122
03:01:54,551 --> 03:01:57,340
belt,
you're more safe rolling with the black

4123
03:01:57,341 --> 03:02:00,340
belt and with anybody because they're.
They're going to be able to tap you if

4124
03:02:00,341 --> 03:02:02,680
they want to and when they do,
they're not going to hurt you.

4125
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:05,080
Right.
Whereas you might get in there with some

4126
03:02:05,290 --> 03:02:08,830
Herculean white belt who's just learning
the techniques.

4127
03:02:08,831 --> 03:02:11,350
He grabs a hold of your arms,
like fucking yanks on it.

4128
03:02:11,351 --> 03:02:12,460
You're like,
ah,

4129
03:02:12,790 --> 03:02:15,850
you don't even have a chance to tap in
to and you're hurt.

4130
03:02:15,940 --> 03:02:17,050
Right?
Yeah.

4131
03:02:17,051 --> 03:02:18,130
That's a good point.
I think.

4132
03:02:18,160 --> 03:02:19,690
Yeah.
Maybe I'll see if Eddie can help me out

4133
03:02:19,691 --> 03:02:20,950
to get me.
He can.

4134
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:24,040
Yeah.
He can do.

4135
03:02:24,150 --> 03:02:25,780
Last night was weird at the comedy
store,

4136
03:02:25,781 --> 03:02:27,460
wasn't it?
Did it was so weird.

4137
03:02:27,461 --> 03:02:29,650
They fourth of July as a strange night
to perform.

4138
03:02:29,860 --> 03:02:31,150
People like,
why are we here?

4139
03:02:31,151 --> 03:02:32,320
And they're like,
why are you here?

4140
03:02:34,990 --> 03:02:36,940
It was a weird crap.
It was a great crowd.

4141
03:02:36,970 --> 03:02:38,010
It looked good,
but they,

4142
03:02:38,230 --> 03:02:41,680
they.
They also felt odd that they were at a

4143
03:02:41,681 --> 03:02:42,281
show.
Yeah.

4144
03:02:42,281 --> 03:02:44,170
I didn't realize it until you said that.
You're like,

4145
03:02:44,620 --> 03:02:45,311
you're like,
yeah,

4146
03:02:45,311 --> 03:02:47,590
these people are thinking it's fourth of
July with the fuck.

4147
03:02:48,940 --> 03:02:50,410
It's not wrong.
It's not right,

4148
03:02:50,411 --> 03:02:52,810
but it's just like,
does my calendar even work?

4149
03:02:52,900 --> 03:02:55,720
The weirdest crowd you'll ever
experience as Christmas?

4150
03:02:55,750 --> 03:02:57,460
Yeah.
You ever do Christmas shows at the

4151
03:02:57,461 --> 03:02:59,620
store?
I did one Christmas show,

4152
03:02:59,621 --> 03:03:01,030
the store like 10 years ago.
I'm like,

4153
03:03:01,060 --> 03:03:03,280
well,
I'm taking the night off for the rest of

4154
03:03:03,281 --> 03:03:05,770
my life.
Fucking crowd's weird,

4155
03:03:05,771 --> 03:03:07,420
man.
They were weird.

4156
03:03:07,421 --> 03:03:10,720
It was more than 10 years ago because it
had to be like 2006.

4157
03:03:11,140 --> 03:03:13,540
You had fun though.
You haven't been feeling weird.

4158
03:03:13,660 --> 03:03:14,291
Oh,
last night.

4159
03:03:14,291 --> 03:03:15,310
Yeah,
last night was fun.

4160
03:03:15,400 --> 03:03:16,233
Last time.
It was fun.

4161
03:03:16,350 --> 03:03:17,320
Yeah,
I had a good time,

4162
03:03:17,660 --> 03:03:20,470
but it's just a,
it's a different feeling.

4163
03:03:20,620 --> 03:03:24,760
But I think people are feeling
differently about comedy now.

4164
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:28,600
Uh,
because so many people are really

4165
03:03:28,601 --> 03:03:32,290
politically correct outside of comedy
and almost forced into it like you're

4166
03:03:32,291 --> 03:03:36,460
hearing so many things about people
getting fired from their jobs because of

4167
03:03:36,461 --> 03:03:40,450
sexual harassment or from a sexually
harassing joke.

4168
03:03:40,451 --> 03:03:43,360
Like someone would say jokes in the
office that were inappropriate.

4169
03:03:43,540 --> 03:03:46,900
So they got fired.
I mean this is happening left and right

4170
03:03:47,090 --> 03:03:49,780
here about the guy from Netflix that got
fired for doing.

4171
03:03:49,781 --> 03:03:51,880
Yeah.
He's having a conversation about

4172
03:03:51,881 --> 03:03:54,970
offensive words that you shouldn't be
using in comedy.

4173
03:03:55,120 --> 03:03:57,320
And because of this,
this conversation during this

4174
03:03:57,321 --> 03:03:57,980
conversation about

4175
03:03:57,980 --> 03:04:01,850
this subject,
he used the word Nigger,

4176
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:04,820
right?
Because he was in this conversation and

4177
03:04:04,821 --> 03:04:07,700
did it one other time apparently because
of that.

4178
03:04:08,030 --> 03:04:13,030
Not Calling anybody that saying it out
loud was fired from Netflix.

4179
03:04:14,210 --> 03:04:17,450
That is crazy,
unless less,

4180
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:21,350
if he was saying it like he likes having
a good time with,

4181
03:04:21,360 --> 03:04:23,180
right.
Like he was like,

4182
03:04:23,181 --> 03:04:25,190
you know,
right now,

4183
03:04:25,520 --> 03:04:27,300
like how was he saying?
Was He,

4184
03:04:27,470 --> 03:04:28,730
that's the thing.
Right.

4185
03:04:29,210 --> 03:04:34,210
But the thing is,
it's very strange that that word is only

4186
03:04:34,251 --> 03:04:39,080
for bitten by the people that can't.
It can't be used on,

4187
03:04:39,430 --> 03:04:43,610
you can't use the n word on you work,
but if you could use it on someone and

4188
03:04:43,611 --> 03:04:46,400
they happen to be a person of color than
that person,

4189
03:04:46,670 --> 03:04:48,270
you're not allowed to do that.
Right.

4190
03:04:48,350 --> 03:04:50,960
It's very interesting man.
Well I remember when I would go,

4191
03:04:50,961 --> 03:04:53,480
when I would ride my bike to school,
a lot of my black friends would get on

4192
03:04:53,481 --> 03:04:54,650
my bike,
you know,

4193
03:04:54,710 --> 03:04:56,270
and they get on and I would ride.

4194
03:04:56,270 --> 03:04:57,410
I mean it was fun,
you know,

4195
03:04:57,650 --> 03:05:01,610
and they used to call me the Nigga bus
whenever I rolled up and they would all

4196
03:05:01,611 --> 03:05:05,570
call me that and I honestly felt and
they were my friends.

4197
03:05:05,571 --> 03:05:06,790
It was fun.
So.

4198
03:05:07,150 --> 03:05:08,380
But you couldn't say it,
you know,

4199
03:05:08,390 --> 03:05:09,680
and I could,
I couldn't say it.

4200
03:05:09,860 --> 03:05:10,820
And also,
look,

4201
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:11,990
I find,
you know,

4202
03:05:11,991 --> 03:05:14,630
when somebody says anything,
if it's something to do with,

4203
03:05:14,631 --> 03:05:15,440
uh,
race,

4204
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:16,041
uh,
gender,

4205
03:05:16,041 --> 03:05:20,930
anything and they have malice or ill
intent and these days I think if you do

4206
03:05:20,931 --> 03:05:23,210
that,
somebody's going to correct you really

4207
03:05:23,211 --> 03:05:25,940
fucking quick.
And so I agree and in a bit,

4208
03:05:25,970 --> 03:05:27,230
but in a business setting,
man,

4209
03:05:27,231 --> 03:05:28,490
and that type of setting,
it's just,

4210
03:05:29,430 --> 03:05:30,330
yeah,
you,

4211
03:05:30,340 --> 03:05:32,540
you make people so aware that they
can't.

4212
03:05:33,100 --> 03:05:35,000
I don't know,
that's the fuck it is.

4213
03:05:35,001 --> 03:05:36,800
It is crazy.
But it's also,

4214
03:05:37,070 --> 03:05:40,370
he was talking about forbidden words and
comments.

4215
03:05:40,580 --> 03:05:43,730
It's his business,
but you're saying you can't make a sound

4216
03:05:44,090 --> 03:05:45,890
with his mouth.
This is what you're saying.

4217
03:05:45,891 --> 03:05:48,350
You're not,
he's not calling someone that name.

4218
03:05:48,560 --> 03:05:52,940
He's using that word and people file
complaints about him using that word.

4219
03:05:52,941 --> 03:05:55,130
So the people that he worked with ratted
him out.

4220
03:05:55,780 --> 03:05:58,110
He wasn't allowed to say the word right,
like,

4221
03:05:58,310 --> 03:06:00,530
but the car then,
then it gets real crazy.

4222
03:06:00,860 --> 03:06:04,760
Whereas if you're a black guy,
you could say it all day and it's funny,

4223
03:06:04,950 --> 03:06:07,850
you could say it in front of white
people and they can laugh,

4224
03:06:07,870 --> 03:06:09,230
right?
But they can't say it,

4225
03:06:09,590 --> 03:06:12,860
but they can't say they can't say it.
But if you're Chris Rock,

4226
03:06:12,890 --> 03:06:17,890
you can go up with the overall tonight
and just have like 15 different use of

4227
03:06:18,231 --> 03:06:21,800
that word in a half hour set and.
No.

4228
03:06:21,801 --> 03:06:23,270
And everyone's like,
that was great.

4229
03:06:23,570 --> 03:06:25,760
That was a great show.
Right?

4230
03:06:25,761 --> 03:06:26,311
But then,
yeah,

4231
03:06:26,311 --> 03:06:29,150
but then it'll be the same people that
say we should never say or hear this

4232
03:06:29,151 --> 03:06:29,750
word.

4233
03:06:29,750 --> 03:06:31,580
It's interesting.
Some people learn it from different

4234
03:06:31,581 --> 03:06:33,500
places,
some people learn it from black people,

4235
03:06:33,501 --> 03:06:36,170
some people learn it from white people.
It has a different feel,

4236
03:06:36,260 --> 03:06:38,060
a different meaning to it.
Well,

4237
03:06:38,170 --> 03:06:40,760
and I was even talking with Mr Peterson
the other day,

4238
03:06:40,850 --> 03:06:43,250
um,
who I was saying,

4239
03:06:43,251 --> 03:06:44,860
you know,
the toughest thing I find that,

4240
03:06:44,890 --> 03:06:46,850
especially coming from the area where I
came from were,

4241
03:06:47,090 --> 03:06:48,680
you know,
there was a lot of racism was probably

4242
03:06:48,681 --> 03:06:51,110
kind of went to,
it was popular when I was young,

4243
03:06:51,111 --> 03:06:53,090
but it was a part of the,
it was part of the,

4244
03:06:53,420 --> 03:06:55,830
of the cloth and the in the,
in the area,

4245
03:06:55,930 --> 03:06:56,030
you

4246
03:06:56,030 --> 03:06:56,551
know,
was poor,

4247
03:06:56,551 --> 03:06:58,530
black and poor white.
And you know,

4248
03:06:58,560 --> 03:07:00,600
poor people.
Like to fucking fight as you know,

4249
03:07:00,630 --> 03:07:02,190
it's crazy.
It's like,

4250
03:07:02,191 --> 03:07:02,671
yeah,
it's like,

4251
03:07:02,671 --> 03:07:04,380
hey,
let's be on the same team for a minute,

4252
03:07:04,440 --> 03:07:07,350
you know,
and we can change the love that you have

4253
03:07:07,351 --> 03:07:08,490
about white privilege.
Oh,

4254
03:07:08,491 --> 03:07:10,260
thanks man.
Hilarious bit.

4255
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:12,420
But did you,
did you,

4256
03:07:13,010 --> 03:07:16,250
I find it fun talking to someone like
Peterson does.

4257
03:07:16,340 --> 03:07:17,360
Was it challenging?

4258
03:07:17,390 --> 03:07:19,010
It was challenging.
I felt nervous.

4259
03:07:19,190 --> 03:07:21,920
I felt nervous because,
you know,

4260
03:07:21,921 --> 03:07:23,840
I'm not as smart as him,
you know,

4261
03:07:23,990 --> 03:07:25,160
most people aren't.
Right.

4262
03:07:25,520 --> 03:07:27,190
But I also felt,
you know,

4263
03:07:27,320 --> 03:07:29,480
I know that um,
you know,

4264
03:07:29,481 --> 03:07:32,120
he really admired you.
He mentioned at the beginning.

4265
03:07:32,121 --> 03:07:34,340
So that made me feel a little bit more
comfortable because we had something in

4266
03:07:34,341 --> 03:07:35,930
common.
And then,

4267
03:07:35,931 --> 03:07:37,760
um,
and then,

4268
03:07:37,820 --> 03:07:40,490
uh,
he's a nice guy and I thought he is a.

4269
03:07:40,910 --> 03:07:44,150
I tried as much as I could to.
I wasn't trying to pick them apart or

4270
03:07:44,151 --> 03:07:47,420
anything.
I just wanted to see what he cared about

4271
03:07:47,421 --> 03:07:49,880
and he just genuinely,
I swear to God,

4272
03:07:49,881 --> 03:07:52,580
he genuinely,
maybe more than anyone I'd ever met.

4273
03:07:52,581 --> 03:07:53,550
He genuinely,
I think,

4274
03:07:53,630 --> 03:07:58,300
cares about trying to help young men
feel better for it and that,

4275
03:07:58,310 --> 03:07:59,960
you know,
we didn't get into anything political or

4276
03:07:59,961 --> 03:08:01,610
anything like that.
It was mostly about,

4277
03:08:02,030 --> 03:08:04,490
you know,
like a take a small step,

4278
03:08:04,491 --> 03:08:06,770
take a small step and you can change
your life.

4279
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:08,180
Um,
you know,

4280
03:08:08,210 --> 03:08:10,160
if you have a,
if you have accurate goals,

4281
03:08:10,161 --> 03:08:12,400
evil,
he's a real clinical psychologist and he

4282
03:08:12,460 --> 03:08:16,000
understands the traps that the mind
leaves for itself.

4283
03:08:16,020 --> 03:08:18,070
Yeah.
And we all fall into those traps.

4284
03:08:18,100 --> 03:08:19,630
Yeah.
We all do.

4285
03:08:19,900 --> 03:08:21,380
Yeah.
And I've fallen into a lot of them and,

4286
03:08:21,520 --> 03:08:22,090
and,
and,

4287
03:08:22,090 --> 03:08:23,230
you know,
so it was nice.

4288
03:08:23,231 --> 03:08:23,710
I mean,
I,

4289
03:08:23,710 --> 03:08:27,010
you know,
as I think of him as like a,

4290
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:29,020
I thought a with Vera,
like,

4291
03:08:29,021 --> 03:08:30,100
you know,
like Chegg Rivera,

4292
03:08:30,101 --> 03:08:34,780
but like Canadian collect,
but I know he's not like,

4293
03:08:34,810 --> 03:08:36,760
I wanted to tell him that so bad and I
forgot,

4294
03:08:38,790 --> 03:08:41,010
but you know,
it was supposed to be a murderous

4295
03:08:41,020 --> 03:08:41,650
monster.
Right.

4296
03:08:41,650 --> 03:08:43,840
And he's not like that.
He's not a socialist like that.

4297
03:08:43,841 --> 03:08:45,490
But um,
but he,

4298
03:08:45,491 --> 03:08:47,280
you know,
he's like the,

4299
03:08:47,350 --> 03:08:51,160
he's kind of like the dad that a lot of
us didn't here and we need to hear again

4300
03:08:51,161 --> 03:08:53,380
and it's like we need those reminders of
some of those things.

4301
03:08:53,381 --> 03:08:54,820
And,
and I think he genuinely,

4302
03:08:54,821 --> 03:08:58,360
to me,
he genuinely wants humanity to be,

4303
03:08:58,361 --> 03:09:00,150
well,
that's what I felt from him does.

4304
03:09:00,190 --> 03:09:02,500
But the thing is,
when you want

4305
03:09:02,660 --> 03:09:05,870
men to feel better,
women will think you want them to feel

4306
03:09:05,871 --> 03:09:07,820
bad.
And this is the problem that we have

4307
03:09:07,821 --> 03:09:12,821
with this whole
right versus left male versus female.

4308
03:09:12,951 --> 03:09:15,320
Black versus white.
Anytime there's two groups and there's

4309
03:09:15,321 --> 03:09:19,130
supposedly pitted against each other,
anything positive for one side becomes

4310
03:09:19,131 --> 03:09:21,530
negative for the other side.
But I think it's the opposite.

4311
03:09:21,531 --> 03:09:25,700
I think that if men feel better,
they'll be nicer to women.

4312
03:09:26,120 --> 03:09:28,040
And I think that if they get their shit
together,

4313
03:09:28,041 --> 03:09:31,040
it's better for everybody.
And I think that if someone's looking

4314
03:09:31,070 --> 03:09:35,480
for men's,
like looking at men's values or men's

4315
03:09:35,481 --> 03:09:38,750
lives,
they're not disregarding women,

4316
03:09:38,751 --> 03:09:40,310
but what we look at it that way,
like,

4317
03:09:40,311 --> 03:09:41,870
no,
you should be paying attention to women.

4318
03:09:42,020 --> 03:09:44,600
You're obviously a misogynist.
You're focusing on men's rights,

4319
03:09:44,601 --> 03:09:48,350
like it's an insult to call someone an
Mra,

4320
03:09:48,380 --> 03:09:52,820
which is a men's rights activist.
It's kind of Hilarious,

4321
03:09:52,990 --> 03:09:53,880
you know,
like what is

4322
03:09:54,400 --> 03:09:55,930
like,
if someone was a women's rights

4323
03:09:55,931 --> 03:09:57,760
activist,
would you ever say that it would be an

4324
03:09:57,761 --> 03:10:00,790
insult to call someone a women's right
activist or advocate?

4325
03:10:00,791 --> 03:10:05,791
That's crazy,
but it's openly dismissed from the

4326
03:10:06,311 --> 03:10:08,650
feminine side,
making fun of the masculine side.

4327
03:10:08,651 --> 03:10:11,530
Like men's rights activists are openly
dismissed.

4328
03:10:11,590 --> 03:10:12,910
It's really,
it's very strange.

4329
03:10:13,560 --> 03:10:14,910
Yeah.
I like to think I'm,

4330
03:10:14,911 --> 03:10:15,620
you know,
I,

4331
03:10:15,620 --> 03:10:16,453
I,
I,

4332
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:18,750
to me,
it's a lot of women's rights activists

4333
03:10:18,930 --> 03:10:20,040
and look,
the strongest,

4334
03:10:20,460 --> 03:10:22,500
hardest working man I've ever known was
my mother,

4335
03:10:22,590 --> 03:10:24,540
you know,
and I'll say that to the end of the

4336
03:10:24,541 --> 03:10:24,991
earth.
I mean,

4337
03:10:24,991 --> 03:10:26,940
my mother delivered newspapers since I
was born,

4338
03:10:26,941 --> 03:10:28,080
still does,
you know,

4339
03:10:28,320 --> 03:10:32,130
and um,
and she sacrificed a lot of raising her

4340
03:10:32,131 --> 03:10:33,990
children.
She wasn't there for us emotionally

4341
03:10:33,991 --> 03:10:35,790
because she had to work all the time.
You know,

4342
03:10:35,850 --> 03:10:38,490
she didn't even have,
she didn't have the opportunity to be.

4343
03:10:39,420 --> 03:10:43,350
But you want to talk about a feminist?
Like I'd never known one more in my

4344
03:10:43,351 --> 03:10:44,400
life.
I don't think,

4345
03:10:44,610 --> 03:10:45,660
you know,
uh,

4346
03:10:45,930 --> 03:10:48,210
she had to play a man and a woman,
you know,

4347
03:10:48,211 --> 03:10:49,800
in a lot,
in a lot of instances.

4348
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:51,030
Um,
and I,

4349
03:10:51,150 --> 03:10:52,830
I,
that's great that you appreciate her.

4350
03:10:53,170 --> 03:10:55,140
Oh,
it to the end.

4351
03:10:55,390 --> 03:10:57,660
But that means so much to you.
Yeah.

4352
03:10:57,661 --> 03:10:59,700
And we started even like,
I started doing this thing where like we

4353
03:10:59,701 --> 03:11:02,590
try and treat a single mom out to like a
weekend when I'm at a,

4354
03:11:02,600 --> 03:11:04,380
on a,
on a weekend of shows,

4355
03:11:04,381 --> 03:11:05,750
you know,
pay for the sitter,

4356
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:07,020
pay for the dinner,
you know,

4357
03:11:07,320 --> 03:11:09,750
and uh,
and not to object a single day as you

4358
03:11:09,751 --> 03:11:10,584
know,
but,

4359
03:11:11,090 --> 03:11:12,000
you know,
for me,

4360
03:11:12,001 --> 03:11:13,140
like I,
uh,

4361
03:11:14,400 --> 03:11:16,200
you know,
like I was even talking with Ms Dot

4362
03:11:16,200 --> 03:11:18,330
Peterson about this.
Like I never got to make like the reason

4363
03:11:18,331 --> 03:11:20,580
I think I got into comedy,
I never got to make my mom laugh,

4364
03:11:20,581 --> 03:11:22,140
you know,
like she was always,

4365
03:11:22,141 --> 03:11:24,810
she was always tired and he was always
working hard and tired and we just

4366
03:11:24,811 --> 03:11:26,750
didn't have that connection,
you know?

4367
03:11:26,790 --> 03:11:28,950
And so I think that's one of the reasons
I got into comedy.

4368
03:11:28,951 --> 03:11:31,170
The only person I've ever really
probably wanted to make laugh as my

4369
03:11:31,171 --> 03:11:32,150
mother,
you know,

4370
03:11:32,520 --> 03:11:36,000
and then here I am like just doing all
this other chicane re on the outside.

4371
03:11:36,030 --> 03:11:38,220
Does your mom think that you were
fondling when you were,

4372
03:11:38,221 --> 03:11:39,570
when you first started?
I don't know.

4373
03:11:39,571 --> 03:11:40,770
No,
I don't think he,

4374
03:11:41,940 --> 03:11:43,710
I don't think she thought if anything
like that.

4375
03:11:43,740 --> 03:11:46,440
My mom literally said to me,
I just don't think you're very funny.

4376
03:11:47,250 --> 03:11:49,080
Oh Mom,
dude.

4377
03:11:49,081 --> 03:11:51,210
I saw that yoga video,
the young video.

4378
03:11:51,211 --> 03:11:53,990
You're doing comedy with the longest
hair on the sides and stuff.

4379
03:11:54,010 --> 03:11:56,160
That was a little cutie dude.
That was the best.

4380
03:11:56,161 --> 03:12:00,720
And that was a really cool video.
I was probably like 24,

4381
03:12:00,750 --> 03:12:03,600
23,
maybe 23,

4382
03:12:03,630 --> 03:12:04,320
one,
two,

4383
03:12:04,320 --> 03:12:06,210
three,
somewhere in that range.

4384
03:12:06,211 --> 03:12:07,620
Man.
Crazy.

4385
03:12:07,960 --> 03:12:09,750
Um,
but I think,

4386
03:12:09,751 --> 03:12:10,800
uh,
I'd like to,

4387
03:12:10,801 --> 03:12:11,550
you know,
a lot of,

4388
03:12:11,550 --> 03:12:12,890
some of these,
you know,

4389
03:12:13,350 --> 03:12:17,340
aggressive sometimes angry feminists.
They're not mothers either.

4390
03:12:17,750 --> 03:12:20,760
And that's odd to me.
Like I'm,

4391
03:12:21,510 --> 03:12:22,343
you know,
people get,

4392
03:12:22,730 --> 03:12:26,210
they get into something because they
feel there's an imbalance and if it

4393
03:12:26,330 --> 03:12:29,670
isn't true feminism or they get into
being a men's rights activist,

4394
03:12:29,880 --> 03:12:32,520
I feel bad for those guys because I
think a lot of those guys are just been

4395
03:12:32,521 --> 03:12:37,521
fucked over by bad relationships or
shitty divorces are shitty laws in terms

4396
03:12:38,521 --> 03:12:42,720
of like a child custody and then they,
you know,

4397
03:12:42,950 --> 03:12:47,070
this is their,
their response and it's what we would

4398
03:12:47,071 --> 03:12:50,230
really like is for everyone to be
treated as an individual and,

4399
03:12:50,530 --> 03:12:54,200
and no groups,
no male versus female,

4400
03:12:54,201 --> 03:12:57,260
no fucking right versus left.
Just all human beings,

4401
03:12:57,410 --> 03:12:59,930
individuals.
And I think that's like the ultimate

4402
03:12:59,931 --> 03:13:02,360
goal for society,
for healthy society.

4403
03:13:02,750 --> 03:13:05,870
It's not to not eliminate judging
people,

4404
03:13:05,871 --> 03:13:08,690
but judge people based on their actions
and their words and their deeds,

4405
03:13:09,170 --> 03:13:11,550
not their sex or their,
you know.

4406
03:13:11,900 --> 03:13:14,120
But then you're always going to have
people that want to fuck the opposite

4407
03:13:14,121 --> 03:13:14,860
sex.

4408
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:17,930
And you're always gonna have people that
want to fuck the same sex to make them

4409
03:13:17,931 --> 03:13:20,630
uncomfortable.
Like I've been hit on by dudes before

4410
03:13:20,690 --> 03:13:22,700
and been made to feel very
uncomfortable.

4411
03:13:23,030 --> 03:13:26,080
I'm sure you have to.
The only difference is a,

4412
03:13:26,200 --> 03:13:29,480
I know how to fight and when the dude
was hitting on me I was like,

4413
03:13:29,481 --> 03:13:31,950
listen,
cut the shit like this.

4414
03:13:32,050 --> 03:13:35,120
This wasn't a scene where I was worried
I was going to get raped.

4415
03:13:35,330 --> 03:13:36,680
It was.
I was worried I was going to go to jail

4416
03:13:36,681 --> 03:13:39,050
for fucking somebody up.
Like I don't want to have to hurt you

4417
03:13:39,051 --> 03:13:40,520
man,
but don't touch my dick again.

4418
03:13:40,710 --> 03:13:43,420
Like I've been in situations before,
but it was never a situation where it

4419
03:13:43,430 --> 03:13:46,520
was like a woman where I was worried I
was going to get held down.

4420
03:13:46,790 --> 03:13:50,210
Someone's going to do something,
but you can understand them when those

4421
03:13:50,211 --> 03:13:50,730
situations.

4422
03:13:50,730 --> 03:13:52,850
Like I can easily see how women feel
that way.

4423
03:13:52,851 --> 03:13:54,710
Like way worse.
Way Worse.

4424
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:55,431
Yeah.
I get that too.

4425
03:13:55,431 --> 03:13:59,270
It's like I'll get like dick pics and
stuff from men into my instagrams and

4426
03:13:59,271 --> 03:14:02,330
stuff bro.
And it's fucking like,

4427
03:14:02,580 --> 03:14:07,400
some are aggressive with that shit,
but that's zero defects.

4428
03:14:07,430 --> 03:14:09,050
Zero.
Well you're going to get them right now.

4429
03:14:09,370 --> 03:14:12,150
They come.
People feel bad for Theo that were

4430
03:14:12,210 --> 03:14:13,190
withheld.
Puppies out.

4431
03:14:13,560 --> 03:14:16,190
Oops.
Something bold about a girl.

4432
03:14:16,220 --> 03:14:19,850
She'll send you a picture of her tits.
Those guys sends a picture of his Dick

4433
03:14:19,851 --> 03:14:22,180
is presumptuous.
Fuck like,

4434
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:24,930
asshole.
Fuck you.

4435
03:14:26,240 --> 03:14:30,410
Fuck you with my.
Get a girls sending you something you're

4436
03:14:30,590 --> 03:14:33,530
excited to see.
Like if a girl sends you pictures of her

4437
03:14:33,531 --> 03:14:35,000
tests and she's holding them,
she was like,

4438
03:14:35,001 --> 03:14:36,920
I heard you wanted the.
You're like,

4439
03:14:36,921 --> 03:14:37,800
whoa.
Oh,

4440
03:14:37,860 --> 03:14:39,800
that was real.
This was crazy.

4441
03:14:39,820 --> 03:14:40,653
Yeah.

4442
03:14:44,310 --> 03:14:46,460
Gatorade.
Somebody gets those.

4443
03:14:46,461 --> 03:14:48,680
Look Open.
Sexually harassed by this woman.

4444
03:14:48,681 --> 03:14:51,620
Shot the fuck up.
You're fine.

4445
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:53,450
Pussy.
Walk it off.

4446
03:14:54,470 --> 03:14:55,590
Dude.
I uh,

4447
03:14:56,060 --> 03:14:56,661
yeah.
It's uh,

4448
03:14:56,661 --> 03:14:58,450
it's so true that.
Um,

4449
03:14:58,580 --> 03:15:00,770
but I do know,
I start to notice how people feel.

4450
03:15:00,771 --> 03:15:02,130
I start to notice how.
Yeah.

4451
03:15:02,230 --> 03:15:02,951
When that happens.
Like,

4452
03:15:02,951 --> 03:15:03,800
oh,
I see how you feel.

4453
03:15:03,830 --> 03:15:06,560
I see now it's all women feel.
If they get that you get,

4454
03:15:06,620 --> 03:15:11,060
there's a door that you could look
through where you could see a mile away

4455
03:15:11,061 --> 03:15:12,850
maybe where this could go.
Right?

4456
03:15:13,010 --> 03:15:16,520
But to be the person that feels that
like a dude wants to stick his dick in

4457
03:15:16,521 --> 03:15:19,310
you and shoot loads into your body,
that's crazy.

4458
03:15:19,311 --> 03:15:22,520
It's like a video game
patient.

4459
03:15:23,650 --> 03:15:25,300
No memory go,
Mr.

4460
03:15:28,030 --> 03:15:29,620
that's,
you know,

4461
03:15:30,020 --> 03:15:33,980
that's the difference between men and
women and this is also why there's more

4462
03:15:33,981 --> 03:15:38,570
anger because women have experienced so
many guys trying to do that to them that

4463
03:15:38,571 --> 03:15:42,020
they developed this bad taste for men
and I understand that and we need to be

4464
03:15:42,021 --> 03:15:43,010
better men,
you know,

4465
03:15:43,160 --> 03:15:45,440
and I believe that honestly,
that's one of the reasons why,

4466
03:15:45,640 --> 03:15:46,670
you know,
I listen to your show.

4467
03:15:46,671 --> 03:15:48,350
It's one of the reasons why,
you know,

4468
03:15:48,351 --> 03:15:49,710
I'm,
I'm excited.

4469
03:15:49,711 --> 03:15:49,980
You know,

4470
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:53,740
I was intrigued to listen to Mr Peterson
and reading his book and um,

4471
03:15:54,090 --> 03:15:55,620
you know,
I do want to be a better man and it's

4472
03:15:55,621 --> 03:15:59,390
hard to even be a better human being.
Everybody does it or a woman or what,

4473
03:15:59,430 --> 03:16:01,620
whoever you are,
we all want to do better.

4474
03:16:01,621 --> 03:16:03,630
And if you don't want to do better,
you're probably going to have a fucked

4475
03:16:03,631 --> 03:16:05,970
up life because then you're not trying.
You're not perfect.

4476
03:16:05,971 --> 03:16:08,370
It's no way you're perfect.
No one who's ever lived has been

4477
03:16:08,371 --> 03:16:09,990
perfect.
I ever want to pay.

4478
03:16:10,620 --> 03:16:12,840
Yeah.
And every day you have to pay attention.

4479
03:16:12,841 --> 03:16:14,320
Every day you got to pay attention to
everyday,

4480
03:16:14,370 --> 03:16:16,590
to your behavior.
To the way you think and you have to

4481
03:16:16,591 --> 03:16:20,940
constantly be assessing it and moving it
in the right direction and when you are

4482
03:16:20,941 --> 03:16:23,280
moving in a positive,
generous,

4483
03:16:23,310 --> 03:16:25,140
loving direction,
it feels better.

4484
03:16:25,470 --> 03:16:26,303
You feel better.

4485
03:16:26,630 --> 03:16:28,320
You feel like a better person.
Yeah.

4486
03:16:28,321 --> 03:16:28,981
You really.
Yeah.

4487
03:16:28,981 --> 03:16:30,380
You really do.
You know,

4488
03:16:30,450 --> 03:16:32,270
I'm glad that I'm.
Yeah,

4489
03:16:32,370 --> 03:16:35,740
I'm just glad to be alive and be able to
like try and like learn about shit.

4490
03:16:35,820 --> 03:16:37,710
It is exciting.
It is exciting.

4491
03:16:38,160 --> 03:16:40,140
And you know,
I think one of the things that fucks

4492
03:16:40,141 --> 03:16:42,960
people up more than anything,
and this is what I've experienced this

4493
03:16:42,961 --> 03:16:44,010
with so many friends,
I'm like,

4494
03:16:44,011 --> 03:16:45,900
dude,
you're thinking about your past.

4495
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:51,080
Like it's you and it's not you.
You can't beat yourself up for something

4496
03:16:51,391 --> 03:16:56,190
you did 20 years ago or the way you were
doing coke and fucking your life up five

4497
03:16:56,191 --> 03:16:57,780
years ago.
That's not you anymore.

4498
03:16:57,960 --> 03:16:59,730
Yeah.
You did do those things.

4499
03:16:59,731 --> 03:17:01,410
Yeah,
but that doesn't mean you are who you

4500
03:17:01,510 --> 03:17:02,290
are,
that you're,

4501
03:17:02,290 --> 03:17:06,090
you're not that person anymore.
Like as long as you decide,

4502
03:17:06,240 --> 03:17:09,040
but if you get caught in that trap,
you'll be that person again.

4503
03:17:09,900 --> 03:17:11,820
I mean there's,
we all know that one dude that can't

4504
03:17:11,821 --> 03:17:12,960
stop,
he can't stop.

4505
03:17:13,170 --> 03:17:15,360
He takes a few months off.
I'm sobering up now.

4506
03:17:15,361 --> 03:17:18,780
Everything's doing good and then whew.
Off to the races again.

4507
03:17:18,810 --> 03:17:20,910
Shows up.
Coked up drunk comes to the comedy

4508
03:17:20,911 --> 03:17:22,500
store,
won't shut the fuck up.

4509
03:17:23,300 --> 03:17:24,750
Shit.
Breadth and everybody's face.

4510
03:17:25,040 --> 03:17:30,040
Jesus sweat dripping off his ear lobes.
We all know that dude,

4511
03:17:30,490 --> 03:17:34,950
seven fingers in his ass.
We all know that dude.

4512
03:17:34,951 --> 03:17:37,500
There's so many of those dudes.
They just can't.

4513
03:17:37,550 --> 03:17:39,510
They,
they never break free.

4514
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:41,310
They break free for a little while and
never go,

4515
03:17:41,311 --> 03:17:42,990
wow,
I don't want to be that person anymore.

4516
03:17:43,230 --> 03:17:43,951
They just go,
well,

4517
03:17:43,951 --> 03:17:46,140
I'm not that person this week.
And then,

4518
03:17:46,160 --> 03:17:47,790
you know,
they just get addicted to being sober

4519
03:17:47,791 --> 03:17:50,250
for a little while.
And then next thing you know,

4520
03:17:50,340 --> 03:17:54,220
just dark arts dark.
Why do you call it dark hard?

4521
03:17:54,600 --> 03:17:57,630
Just because if anything that I think
takes you out of like your path towards

4522
03:17:57,750 --> 03:18:01,200
some sort of enlightenment a little bit,
that's what I think,

4523
03:18:01,201 --> 03:18:01,841
you know,
dark arts,

4524
03:18:01,841 --> 03:18:04,230
they got in Harry Potter like voldemort
and everybody,

4525
03:18:04,810 --> 03:18:09,120
dirty spells turning candy into worms
and everything right

4526
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:13,890
now.
Anything that takes you off of the path

4527
03:18:13,891 --> 03:18:16,230
of enlightenment,
the dark arts,

4528
03:18:16,260 --> 03:18:19,380
that's most things don't right.
Most Times you jerking off,

4529
03:18:19,470 --> 03:18:23,310
oh,
come on myself so many times bro.

4530
03:18:23,400 --> 03:18:24,233
Right,
and when you do,

4531
03:18:24,240 --> 03:18:27,090
do you ever feel good about it?
Do you ever feel like.

4532
03:18:27,091 --> 03:18:29,010
Yeah,
that's what I should times seasonal.

4533
03:18:29,020 --> 03:18:30,890
Like occasionally during the holidays,
Bro.

4534
03:18:30,930 --> 03:18:33,660
I'm not even joking.
Sometimes they're the holidays.

4535
03:18:33,661 --> 03:18:36,060
I'm just so filled with joy that the
shame doesn't get me.

4536
03:18:36,160 --> 03:18:40,050
Do you know that it actually does
alleviate anxiety and people recommend

4537
03:18:40,051 --> 03:18:43,230
doing it before you have a performance.
You have to perform in front of people.

4538
03:18:44,020 --> 03:18:45,860
Yeah.
It's not a bad idea.

4539
03:18:45,890 --> 03:18:48,280
WAC One off and your hotel room before
you go to a show,

4540
03:18:48,380 --> 03:18:51,850
you'd be like less anxious.
I could see that navy maybe for like a

4541
03:18:51,851 --> 03:18:53,350
special or something.
You know,

4542
03:18:56,930 --> 03:18:59,140
Vio von.
That was the three hours.

4543
03:18:59,210 --> 03:19:00,130
What is it really?
Wow.

4544
03:19:00,580 --> 03:19:01,930
More than three hours.
How long was it?

4545
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:04,300
Three slash 20 jeeper.
20 time.

4546
03:19:04,400 --> 03:19:07,330
This conversation I've ever been on this
fucking room.

4547
03:19:07,331 --> 03:19:08,830
Dude.
Something happens in this place.

4548
03:19:08,831 --> 03:19:12,070
I don't even know how it works.
[inaudible] DOT com.

4549
03:19:12,100 --> 03:19:15,040
Feel Vaughn on twitter.
[inaudible] on instagram.

4550
03:19:15,370 --> 03:19:16,520
When you on the road next.
Um,

4551
03:19:16,530 --> 03:19:19,940
I'm actually going to be an ochsner
tonight through Saturday and then let me

4552
03:19:20,040 --> 03:19:21,190
try.
Yeah,

4553
03:19:21,490 --> 03:19:22,840
that's a great club.
Is it?

4554
03:19:22,841 --> 03:19:23,830
I've never been.
Oh,

4555
03:19:23,831 --> 03:19:24,664
you're gonna.
Love it.

4556
03:19:24,710 --> 03:19:26,920
It's great.
It's a sweet setup.

4557
03:19:26,950 --> 03:19:28,300
It's fucking awesome.
Crow.

4558
03:19:28,410 --> 03:19:30,370
Their pump that something's out there.
Yeah.

4559
03:19:30,420 --> 03:19:32,350
You know,
it's like a mini Bakersfield.

4560
03:19:32,620 --> 03:19:33,500
Oh Wow.
Closer.

4561
03:19:33,600 --> 03:19:35,080
I like that.
It's closer though.

4562
03:19:35,140 --> 03:19:35,871
I'm excited,
dude.

4563
03:19:35,871 --> 03:19:37,330
I'm like,
I'm going to try that Brazilian Jujitsu

4564
03:19:37,420 --> 03:19:39,930
and I'm like fucking knife.
Fight a raccoon.

4565
03:19:40,850 --> 03:19:43,840
Leave the recommends alone,
but get into that Jujitsu son.

4566
03:19:44,850 --> 03:19:46,180
Alright,
we'll be back next week.

4567
03:19:46,360 --> 03:19:47,490
You freaks.
Bye.

Thanks Cheryl.
