1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,240
All
right man,

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,070
we're live all of a sudden.
Thanks for having me,

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:08,940
man.
Thanks for being here.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,810
Yeah,
this is cool.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,510
This is cool.
Any friend of Duncan's a friend of mine.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,470
Likewise.
Likewise.

7
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,460
It's cool.
It's fun,

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,181
Dude.
Okay,

9
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:20,181
so I have to ask the opening question.
What the fuck is it like being the son

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,880
of Timothy Leary?
The opening question,

11
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,440
right?
It has to be the has to be.

12
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,274
Okay.
That's cool.

13
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,960
Um,
yeah man,

14
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,680
you know,
and you know that the answer to the

15
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,530
question kind of,
it's changed a lot over the course of

16
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:35,850
time obviously,
you know,

17
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:38,940
because when I was younger,
when I was a kid,

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,700
you know,
really up until my mid twenties,

19
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,310
even my late twenties,
I would say like,

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,730
I didn't know how to answer that
question.

21
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:47,070
How could I,
it's just all I knew was just life,

22
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:48,210
you know,
it's just my dad.

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,130
It's just how I grew up,
you know,

24
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:53,450
he would take me to little league,
he'd make sure I did my homework or

25
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,680
didn't do my homework in my case,
but whatever it was,

26
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,750
you know what I mean?
It just was a life,

27
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,660
I didn't have any objectivity to it.
I didn't have any distance from it.

28
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,100
I couldn't be remote from it,
you know,

29
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:06,240
I didn't know like that.
It was perhaps really strange.

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,891
And then,
uh,

31
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:08,490
you know,
he,

32
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,080
he died in [inaudible] 96.
I was 22 and then kind of after that

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,170
then I sort of,
you know,

34
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,670
I got some distance from it.
Then I was like,

35
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,504
Oh shit,
you know,

36
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,260
things were a little different at home,
you know,

37
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,130
they were.
Well,

38
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,410
your dad is probably like one of the
most important,

39
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:30,270
if not the most important people ever in
terms of the psychedelic revolution.

40
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,220
He was,
I mean,

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,280
yeah.
My relationship with him and my

42
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,570
relationship,
especially with his work was um,

43
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,810
yeah,
I mean of course the sexuality part was

44
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,560
a core pillar and I understood that's
what made him famous,

45
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,820
but I considered him to be like,
he was a futurist really,

46
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,110
you know,
when,

47
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,480
during my formative years.
I mean,

48
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,230
the psychedelic thing was always there,
but he was much more interested in like,

49
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,430
in technology and cyber culture and kind
of like the progressive kind of

50
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,260
technology,
arts and things like that.

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,410
And uh,
you know,

52
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:03,750
in the eighties he called,
uh,

53
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,100
the,
the PC,

54
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,750
the lsd of the eighties,
you know,

55
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:11,070
so he was kind of really shifting and I
kind of considered him by somebody who

56
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,580
just had the innate ability to
constantly reinvent themselves.

57
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,830
And of course the psychedelics were,
you know,

58
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,960
were the core and I guess probably is
also probably a big part of how we can

59
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,770
reinvent themselves.

60
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,670
Right?
Yeah,

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,211
yeah,
yeah.

62
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:24,561
No,
that,

63
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,394
that,
that's,

64
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,880
that's true.
I mean,

65
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,220
well,
and considering,

66
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:30,930
I mean,
you can relate with this I think too.

67
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,790
And you know,
he didn't do his first second delek

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,590
until he was 40.
Oh Wow.

69
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,191
You were,
what,

70
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,760
30 or something,
right?

71
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,280
Yeah.
So it's a similar,

72
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,660
like you're well into your adult life
and you're well formed.

73
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,190
You have an identity.
That's Jack Harris story too.

74
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,110
Oh,
is Jack Hara?

75
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:49,890
Was a goldwater republican like deep
into his,

76
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,470
uh,
again,

77
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,610
I think he was getting divorced.
I met,

78
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,040
uh,
met a young gal and she turned them onto

79
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,210
the weed and all of a sudden he was
like,

80
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,070
Hey,
what the fuck have I been missing?

81
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,980
Yeah,
he's still

82
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,320
at,
to this day is still the strongest we'd

83
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:05,560
have ever had Jack Harris trained.
Fuck man.

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,010
He was a cool guy,
man.

85
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,220
He was a bum me out when he left.
Yeah,

86
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,450
he did good work.
So your dad probably would have had an

87
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:18,451
amazing time with what's going on today
in terms of virtual reality and the

88
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,780
integration of cell phones into our life
and an almost inescapable way.

89
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,130
Yeah,
I mean,

90
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,040
it's funny like the vr thing where just
jamie and I were just talking about it

91
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,510
before we rolled tape,
um,

92
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,820
you know,
we were doing vr,

93
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:32,170
like,
you know,

94
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,330
we were at the NASA Ames research
center.

95
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,980
People were like,
Jaron Lanier.

96
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,150
And we're like,
really?

97
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:37,950
Um,
uh,

98
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,621
you know,
journaling.

99
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:41,650
There was kind of the godfather of vr
and he was bringing kind of setup store

100
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:45,400
house in the early nineties.
And like really early,

101
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:49,240
kind of almost eight bit rudimentary Vr,
but it was there.

102
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,330
So like what did that look like?
It kind of looks like I'm being an

103
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,110
inside of an Atari video game.
So real pixelated,

104
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,060
pixelated,
eight bit kind of Clunky,

105
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:04,480
blocked like,
but with full three dimensionality and

106
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,100
stuff like that.
Did you ever see loved it?

107
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,490
Duncan's Oculus the first day of the
first versions that he had,

108
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,070
which was kind of like that real kind of
pixelated.

109
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,380
Was it similar to that and very similar
to that?

110
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:17,560
Yeah.
And you had a Duncan and I went on the

111
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,420
show together and didn't go gunters
university.

112
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,960
It's Vr chat show and you know,
this was recent and you know,

113
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,210
it's still,
vr is still kind of in that,

114
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,890
you know,
how does that work?

115
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,891
Like does someone have a Vr headset on
another location and then you guys both

116
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,060
enter the same room.
So you're in the room together.

117
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,691
You.
Yeah.

118
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,580
Well Dunk and I actually we're in the
same room together.

119
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,970
We happen to be but yeah.
And then all of these people with

120
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:43,150
different headsets on and then everybody
has a different avatar and they're all

121
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,930
in that room with you.
They're all in the room.

122
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,200
Was very cool,
very cool.

123
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:48,950
But I like that one.
Um,

124
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,180
I think the servers crashed 20 people.
Oh,

125
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,390
how many people can it support?
Uh,

126
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,500
what we had.
Maybe like a thousand I think.

127
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,140
But yeah,
I like to get beyond that.

128
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,620
You need some Pr.
I mean the avatars,

129
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,760
you know,
they're pretty involved.

130
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:02,890
They're pretty,
you know,

131
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,770
they made me into this Hari Krishna monk
or some shit,

132
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,270
like the psychedelic clown.
It was pretty cool.

133
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,760
But yeah,
you know,

134
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,820
my dad load field and we were,
you know,

135
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,990
he was,
it was right near.

136
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,420
He'd love it.
It'd be really cool.

137
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,710
Yeah.
I've always thought about him and I'm

138
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,370
Mckenna.
Mckenna obviously was a big futurist as

139
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:26,371
well and completely fascinated by the
possibilities and where technology was

140
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:29,860
going out of love to see those guys
today.

141
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,150
Just take this all in and try to.
Yeah.

142
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,921
Amazing.
Right?

143
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:37,150
Like terrence was writing about the
connection between psilocybin in virtual

144
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,984
reality.
Right?

145
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,030
I mean,
that's the subtext of not food,

146
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:43,480
of the gods,
but if I'm one of those nations,

147
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,140
no,
no,

148
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,650
it wasn't that one.
I'm filing which ones,

149
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,660
what it's called mushrooms,
virtual reality and you know,

150
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:53,470
and he really saw the connection between
and you know,

151
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:58,471
there is no accident that the
godfather's the true visionaries of the

152
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,480
Silicon Valley Movement.

153
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,990
We're kind of remnants from the 60,
you know,

154
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,100
Steve Jobs,

155
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,390
archaic,
revival,

156
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,220
revival.
Yeah.

157
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,203
That's it.
Yeah,

158
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,790
that's right.
Um,

159
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,390
yeah.
He also,

160
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:16,391
terrance also had this idea that you
would be able to recreate the DMT world

161
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,700
in virtual reality and you'd be able to
experience what people see when they're

162
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,450
on dmt without actually taking the drug.
He believed that there was going to come

163
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:31,430
a time when technology was so good and
the images that you could create would

164
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,970
be so elaborate that you literally could
create the DMT images.

165
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,490
I couldn't believe what I'm kind of.
I'm kind of leaning there right now

166
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:39,540
myself,
you know,

167
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,430
I mean we kind of a,
again,

168
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:41,971
Duncan,
you know,

169
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:44,290
we kind of had this crackpot idea of
taking a,

170
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,430
a Vr into the flotation tank,
into the float tank with this kind of in

171
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:53,930
mind that by disassociating the body and
kind of getting rid of it because you

172
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,710
know,
what's the big dmt thing is it's the

173
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:58,050
disassociated.
If you just leave Joe,

174
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:03,051
you leave Zach and you become whatever.
So by taking the vr masks it a headset

175
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:06,540
into the tank.
Maybe combining the two worlds that

176
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,650
could.
I don't know,

177
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm still bullish on that.
I think it could work.

178
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,290
I think Sarah says,
right?

179
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,273
It sounds like

180
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,830
possible.
I know crash when the float that.

181
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,640
Excuse me,
the float lab crash has this setup where

182
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:22,350
he is developed a screen that has the
lowest amount of light that could be

183
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:25,680
admitted to the point where you don't
see the edges of the screen,

184
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,600
so you literally,
while you're in the tank,

185
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:31,470
it's floating above your head.
It's suspended above your head and you

186
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:36,471
see the image as if it's like just the
video just floating in the sky.

187
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,290
Oh Wow.
And he believes that by separating your

188
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:45,240
body from a sensory input so you're not
feeling your feet on the ground,

189
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,220
you're not feeling the weight of the
world on your shoulders,

190
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:48,330
all that jazz.
You're floating.

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,110
He thinks you could take in data better.
And so his idea was to show

192
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:55,560
documentaries and you know,
instructionals and things along those

193
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:57,120
lines that you would learn quicker that
way.

194
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,021
Yeah.
Interesting.

195
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:00,120
Right?
Because so much of your brain and the

196
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:03,480
function of the cerebral cortex is to
integrate the body.

197
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,430
This movement,
Standing Upright,

198
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,250
you know,
and being muscular and moving around.

199
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:11,520
And if you get rid of that right,
you're kind of opens up and I can take

200
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:12,130
more in.

201
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,480
Well,
the way I always describe it to people

202
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,890
that haven't used the tank,
I was like,

203
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:16,600
imagine if you were having a
conversation,

204
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:19,560
but next to you people were screaming.
If it was an important conversation,

205
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,660
you'd want to get away from those people
screaming because even though you think

206
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,430
of it as a distraction,
it's just input.

207
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,080
It's just data that you have to
consider,

208
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,240
you know,
will you also have to consider your butt

209
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,100
on this chair,
the room,

210
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:33,970
the dimensions that you're calculating
as you're moving your head around social

211
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,170
cues,
language,

212
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:39,640
all these different things are all being
calculated and they require resources.

213
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,241
Right?
Well,

214
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:42,310
when you are in that tank,
there's none of that.

215
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,060
And so your brain feels supercharged.
It feels like you have all these

216
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:47,620
resources have been opened up to you.

217
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,680
Yeah.
And,

218
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,690
and I agree with you and I think,
you know,

219
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,400
all of those resources,
resources that you're speaking of,

220
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:56,040
those are sort of the things that to

221
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,650
this idea of what we call the Eco,
you know,

222
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,090
and the same thing with psychedelics,
you know,

223
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:03,150
they formulate the ego and our body and
being separate.

224
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:03,901
Oh my God,
Joe,

225
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:04,850
you're strong.
I meant,

226
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,690
you know,
just all these kinds of different things

227
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:09,060
that create this image of who we think
we are.

228
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,910
Psychedelics,
the tank meditation,

229
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:16,410
whatever method you want to pick,
gets rid of that and purely gets into

230
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,010
soul land or something else.
Did you ever meet John Lilly?

231
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,450
Oh yeah.
Spent a long time.

232
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,400
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

233
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Did a lot of what I've done research
with John Research air quotes back in

234
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,360
the day.
That guy,

235
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:34,230
man,
he's the.

236
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,090
For people who don't know.
We were talking about the guy who

237
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:40,020
invented the sensory deprivation tank
and he was a pioneer in interspecies

238
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,900
communication with dolphins.
Yeah.

239
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,360
Fascinating.
Fascinating guy.

240
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,660
Fascinating guy.
And you know,

241
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,850
the last 20 years of his life,
um,

242
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,940
you know,
the ketamine aspect was such a huge part

243
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,970
of,
of what he was doing and did he get to

244
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:57,420
and do it the academy and seems to be an
addictive substance.

245
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,340
Um,
look,

246
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,180
I mean,
I love John.

247
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,440
I did.
I thought it was great.

248
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:05,890
It was a good friend of my dad's and I
certainly wouldn't say anything too

249
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,170
negative about them,
but yeah,

250
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,110
one toke over the line.
That's what Jesus Todd Mccormick has a

251
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,150
very funny story about it.
Do you know what Tom Mccormick is?

252
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,100
I don't know.
Todd's one of the first guys to get

253
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:22,101
arrested in California for medical
marijuana where he was arrested in the

254
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,440
early or the late nineties,
early two thousands.

255
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,350
And um,
he was one of the first people to find

256
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:33,351
out that when you are legally growing
marijuana in California,

257
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,890
because of the law,
the medical law,

258
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,310
the federal government can still
prosecute you and when they prosecute

259
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,690
you,
you are in court.

260
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:43,800
You are not allowed to even bring up the
term medical marijuana because that's

261
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:46,830
not a real term federally.
So he had,

262
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,360
yeah,
it was a railroad here at railroad and

263
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,223
went to jail.

264
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,570
Um,
but anyway,

265
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:56,220
point being he was a at John Lilly's.
He actually still owns John Lilly's

266
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:57,240
tank.
Oh Wow.

267
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,940
Yeah.
And he was with John Lilly and John

268
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,151
Lilly,
uh,

269
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,850
invited him to get in the tank.
And uh,

270
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:04,950
so todd's about to go into the tank and
he says,

271
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,800
do you want to do ketamine?
And he's like,

272
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm stepping into the tank.
And he's like,

273
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,400
have,
of course it's John Lilly,

274
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:14,260
what am I going to say?
Right.

275
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,780
So he hits him with a blast of
intramuscular ketamine and the thigh and

276
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:22,110
then todd starts freaking out.
He's in the tank and he's freaking out.

277
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,780
So John gets into another tank next to
him,

278
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,470
blasts themself with Ketamine and goes
and visits him.

279
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,800
Glad.
Yeah.

280
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,090
Yeah.
They've found whatever.

281
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:35,970
Same fucking dimension in the academy in
world.

282
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,020
And it worked.
Yes.

283
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,580
It work.
What does that mean?

284
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,230
I don't know because I've never done
ketamine.

285
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,890
So have you.
Yeah,

286
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,560
I've done it in the tank to w.
okay.

287
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:44,940
What is,
what happens in there?

288
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,820
Well,
it's been a while since I've done it in

289
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:51,300
the tank and I'm not so sure I'd do it
again and we're going to do it again.

290
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,860
Uh,
but I'm glad I did it.

291
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,100
Um,
God

292
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,480
man.
Well,

293
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,320
you read that description of what
terence writes about,

294
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,940
ketamine,
that it's,

295
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,830
um,
I'm not sure I'm going to get it exactly

296
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:06,010
right.
But Ketamine is sort of like you're

297
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,810
going inside of an office building but
it stark and there's nothing in the

298
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:13,600
office or something like that.
And it's vacant.

299
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,760
Yes.
Um,

300
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,150
well he believed,
turns,

301
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,180
believed that when you were experiencing
like a heavy duty mushroom trip,

302
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,570
you're not just experiencing your trip,
but you're experiencing all the

303
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,910
different people that have ever done
mushrooms together.

304
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,753
Tripping.
That's,

305
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,980
which is why a lot of people when they
take psilocybin and particularly they

306
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:35,740
get a lot of Aztec and Mayan imagery.
Sorry.

307
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,491
That's the.
Okay.

308
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:37,270
I grew up on.
Yeah,

309
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,020
it is.
Yeah.

310
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,060
Yeah.
I mean our,

311
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,860
every single indigenous culture,
you know,

312
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,890
except for the eskimos because they
couldn't grow shit.

313
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,610
But every single indigenous culture
until very reasonably,

314
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,210
psychedelics were a core part of their,
of their methodology,

315
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:53,770
of,
of their tribal rituals.

316
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,420
You know,
anyone's got fucked,

317
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,860
Huh?
Nothing up there,

318
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,190
dude.
You picked a bad spot.

319
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,650
Hit the bad.
Giving so much fish but cut ketamine and

320
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,970
the tank though.
I mean it is.

321
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:06,220
Um,
it's quite a journey.

322
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,143
I,
it's,

323
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,120
you know,
it's kind of like how the best way I

324
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:14,590
could explain it is if black,
if you could see colors within

325
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,930
blackness,
if there were shades of black,

326
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,060
if that makes any sense.
Like,

327
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:22,180
because it's pitch black and the tank
and your head is pitch black,

328
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:27,181
but somehow you're getting sacred
geometry and sort of kind of visions and

329
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:32,200
kind of downloads that are in the color
black,

330
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,350
if that makes any sense at all.
Um,

331
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,363
yeah,
I,

332
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,120
I,
God,

333
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,060
I mean,
one of the great moments of my life

334
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:43,750
actually was picked.
I was getting to Ketamine inside the

335
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:47,980
tank and uh,
this tank was right outside of my dad's

336
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:52,981
kind of sliding glass window
which went out into the lawn in his

337
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:56,470
bedroom up in,
up here in the Hollywood hills.

338
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,840
And um,
you know,

339
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,600
I went in and took a little kedamine Rom
das was visiting that day,

340
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:05,320
visiting my dad and uh,
the last time they ever saw each other

341
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,050
and he died,
just my dad died just like a month

342
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,970
afterwards.
And I went inside the tank.

343
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,250
Uh,
the two of them were visiting right

344
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,660
outside of the tank hatch.
You know,

345
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:18,070
how the hatch comes out and they didn't
know I wasn't inside a.

346
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,610
and I was,
I was lost in this whole just completely

347
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,420
fucked.
Just like,

348
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,710
oh my God,
what am I going to do?

349
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:25,480
And the only thing I knew how to do with
like,

350
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,480
you know,
get the fuck out the hole for people who

351
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:31,900
don't know what we're talking about is
what people describe the ketamine

352
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,630
experience when you're just kind of
stuck and stuck in life.

353
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:38,290
It's kind of like code red,
like ejected the eject button,

354
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:42,210
you know.
So I popped open the hatch and you know,

355
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,810
my dad and Ron doss are sending us close
as you and I right now are right now and

356
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,630
you know,
I'm with self referential enough to know

357
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:50,231
like,
oh wow,

358
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,160
this is crazy.
Two of them sitting

359
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,070
here right now.
I mean I wasn't stupid and you're naked

360
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:59,750
and you're tripping and tripping on
academy and everyone is just completely

361
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,220
silent.
Stare at each other.

362
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:05,390
And Rom Dastis leans into me and goes,
who are you now?

363
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,000
Although,
and it was kind of like a defining

364
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,720
moment in my life journey,
my life,

365
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,470
man.
Are you now fog?

366
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,710
Kind of my mantra
for life now.

367
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,680
But that was over 20 years ago now.
Wow.

368
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,280
So did you feel like,
was that the last time you did it in the

369
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:27,520
tank?
Uh,

370
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,300
no.
I'm a glutton for punishment.

371
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,520
Yeah,
I did do it one other time after that.

372
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:34,900
Yeah.
So what is it particularly about the k

373
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,970
hole?
Like when you,

374
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:37,640
when you go into what they call a k
hole?

375
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,350
Like I've,
I've heard it described by people who

376
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:41,660
were like recreational users.
I wouldn't,

377
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,090
I wouldn't call them psychonauts.
They're more like,

378
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,890
you know,
people go to raves and stuff.

379
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,620
It's dark man and stark and I don't
quite get it.

380
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,780
I don't get the ketamine in the public
rave setting at.

381
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,120
It doesn't make sense to me.
But,

382
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,460
but um,
John loved it.

383
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:56,120
Lily,
right?

384
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,290
He did loved it.
Ketamine.

385
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,110
Yuck.
But why was that his thing?

386
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,240
Like what did he,
what was his raves about it?

387
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,300
I mean he just.
Oh God.

388
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,283
I mean,
well,

389
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,220
to understand that relationship is also
into understand John a little bit in the

390
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,450
sense that,
you know,

391
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,340
I mean he was the guy who said,
you know,

392
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,500
my body is my laboratory.
Right.

393
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,670
You know,
I mean he was,

394
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,680
you know,
one point he gave himself a boob

395
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:19,670
implant,
you know what I mean?

396
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,060
He was way out there.
And what do you use for the boob

397
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,610
implant?
Don't know,

398
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,240
like the ones that are standard ones
that women get silicone or whatever.

399
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,500
Did he give himself one?
Only one to really.

400
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,330
So he was,
were some darkness involved there and

401
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,240
did he try to make them look like
women's breasts?

402
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,500
Yeah,
yeah,

403
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,270
yeah.
If I recall,

404
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:43,570
you have found a picture of that.
If we could find,

405
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,360
um,
did he lose a bet or is it just like,

406
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,760
no,
I wanted to have breast implants.

407
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,880
I think you'd just,
my body is my laboratory now and sort of

408
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,620
just the.
I mean at that time,

409
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:57,170
I mean now what does being gender fluid
is such a,

410
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,970
you know,
we could talk about that.

411
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,410
That's really gender fluid.
Know that's one of the things about

412
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,190
breast implants.
It's like at the end of the day everyone

413
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,110
knows what the fuck that is.
There's this,

414
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,370
there's this weird sort of suspension of
disbelief where we're looking at these

415
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:16,460
water bags that are surgically stuffed
under your skin and we're just

416
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:21,461
pretending this is like he's your sexual
organs that are plump and ripe on the

417
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,180
vine,
but it's not,

418
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,460
it's,
it's one of the weirdest things about

419
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,920
like being a tripper and deciding to do
that.

420
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,301
It's like,
well,

421
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,440
you're,
you're violating a lot of like bizarre

422
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,180
paradigms.
Yeah,

423
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:36,560
but I mean he was also kind of bending
the paradigm and kind of bending the

424
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:37,700
idea of like,
you know,

425
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:41,150
you can be anything this time around if
I want to be helpful and when it could

426
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:42,260
be half women,
I can do that.

427
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,140
I'm a doctor in the.
We're living in this golden age of being

428
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:49,920
able to morph yourself into whatever the
fuck you can imagine kind of thing.

429
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,140
Yeah.
I wonder if numbers early too,

430
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,510
with a lot of those guys that trips so
much,

431
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,070
it's like a,
I think a least for practical purposes.

432
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:02,430
We would all like to think that you
would like to have a psychedelic

433
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,610
experience and then come back down to
earth and be able to,

434
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:07,410
you know,
make use of that in the real world.

435
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,450
Like it can kind of benefit you in the
real world.

436
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,403
That's the idea,
right?

437
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,940
That's sort of the idea.
I mean,

438
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:14,820
so why should we impart those standards
on anybody?

439
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,290
I mean,
you could do whatever you want,

440
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:21,030
but I think some guys like lily is
probably a prime example that people use

441
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:25,650
as a point of reference went so far
because it's like where's the baseline

442
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,330
now?
Like there's no baseline for him

443
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,220
anymore.
He was just so out there.

444
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,750
He was,
he was.

445
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:31,860
Yeah.
And um,

446
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,990
yeah,
I mean I,

447
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:36,660
I agree with you and also,
I mean not to,

448
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,620
you know,
use you as a,

449
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,350
it's a great model,
but you're a great poster child for

450
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,690
Psychedelic stuff as my dad was,
you know,

451
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,560
it's,
you know,

452
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,610
you're well into your adult life and it
changed your consciousness and you're

453
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:54,260
able to apply it to your work to what
you do and you know,

454
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,220
and it's become very fluid and very
integrated.

455
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,240
You don't hide it.
You're,

456
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,590
you're public about it.
You can,

457
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,640
you found a way to integrate it.
I mean that's the idea of spiritual

458
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,160
practices and it,
it's about integration and I think it's

459
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:10,161
important to not hide it.
And I think if there's much more fear of

460
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:13,190
repercussions than actual repercussions,
you know,

461
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,750
I think Terence Mckenna had a great
saying.

462
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,970
He said,
too many people are doing the man's work

463
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:22,320
for the man race.
Like they don't really care if you're

464
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:25,350
out doing mushrooms.
That's not what they're trying to do is

465
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:30,351
they're trying to stop large scale sales
and distribution of schedule one drugs.

466
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,940
They're not trying to stop some dude
from doing mushrooms.

467
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,500
Right.
And look what we're seeing with

468
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,180
microdosing right now,
valley,

469
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,360
I mean more and more people are kind of
coming out of the closet and you know,

470
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,850
supposedly what the names that are kind
of attached to the rumor mill of who's

471
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,350
doing micro dosing in Silicon Valley.

472
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,730
It's huge.
Yeah,

473
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,110
I mean it's,
it's really,

474
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,520
that's really insane.
It's great.

475
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,060
It is.
And I think as marijuana is now legal in

476
00:19:57,061 --> 00:20:00,870
the state and it becomes legal in more
and more states and hopefully one day

477
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:05,520
it'll be released from the schedule one,
which is just so crazy that the dea

478
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:09,690
decided to.
They mean they got to the door this past

479
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,760
summer.
They did and then they decided to pull

480
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:15,540
away and just keep it at schedule one,
which means there's no medical benefit,

481
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,440
which is a lie.
Well it.

482
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:22,110
And that's especially fucked and I'm
kind of down on Obama for that as much

483
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,870
as i.
parts of Obama I really do admire.

484
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,030
But that I think was an epic failure.
And considering,

485
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,000
you know,
he just parked in 158 guys.

486
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:34,020
Most of them are nonviolent drug
offenders and the two are synonymous,

487
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,861
you know,
it's like,

488
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:36,480
okay,
you treated the symptom man,

489
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:37,170
that's great.

490
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,900
I'm glad you really those guys from
prison and good for you,

491
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,050
but treat the fucking disease man.
It's like you got to treat.

492
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,290
And now where as we're stepping into
this dark age,

493
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,400
I mean I'm calling it a dark age.
I mean that's the trump dark age of dark

494
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:51,881
age.
You know,

495
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,190
it's not good for,
for,

496
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
for these things.
Well,

497
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:57,520
I don't know if it is or it isn't,
but what the problem is that when you

498
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:01,450
know something like,
like if you and I know what's dangerous

499
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:03,520
and what's not,
like math is dangerous.

500
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,810
Dangerous marijuana is on dangerous.
So when,

501
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:10,090
when you look at all the facts and then
you look at all the absolutely proven

502
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:14,260
medical benefits and then you see that
they're denying the existence of these

503
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:15,094
yet go,
okay,

504
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,250
well the people that are in control of
locking people up and throw them in the

505
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,400
jail,
they're a bunch of liars because they're

506
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,730
just ignoring the science.

507
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,940
There had an the research and the
research that's gone back to the 19

508
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:29,941
seventies at the Nixon administration
paid for and then ignored and now I

509
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,560
think the bar was even raised,
right.

510
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:35,950
CBD is just cutting thrown into that
really recently,

511
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:38,620
which is just a really sneaky thing
because cbd,

512
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:42,580
much like hemp has zero psychoactive
properties.

513
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:45,970
It's not doing anything to alter your
consciousness in terms of getting you

514
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,480
high and dry,
but it does amazing stuff for reducing

515
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:51,760
inflammation for people that have
arthritis.

516
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,730
It's a like a lifesaver.
So,

517
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,190
you know,
the only thing I could kind of in this

518
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,560
thread is kind of think about and talk
about is,

519
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:01,840
okay,
well what is,

520
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,340
you know,
what's the reason behind this?

521
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:07,810
I mean if you kind of isolate big Pharma
and talk about that and then,

522
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,530
you know,
I know the CBD industry,

523
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,660
they're big farmers.

524
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,503
The enemy,
right?

525
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,900
Yeah.
But I also have to just kind of say that

526
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,140
big Pharma's main goal is to make money,
you know,

527
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,290
to create products that make money.
It doesn't matter what the product is,

528
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:27,460
if they told you that you know a plastic
is going to alleviate cancer,

529
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:28,930
you know,
they would make a plastic pill,

530
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,160
but so what is,
who is the enemy within this that is

531
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:37,840
making things like cbd and marrow like
is this just kind of left over from kind

532
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:39,640
of baby boom,
paranoia,

533
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,900
kind of narrow consciousness that we
can't possibly allow these substances

534
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,820
to,
to fix us,

535
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:46,690
to help us.
I mean,

536
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,120
what is that?
Because there's tremendous profit

537
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:53,800
potential so something isn't in
alignment to where the depths that can't

538
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:56,110
be controlled like Viagra,
like it's hard.

539
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,860
It's hard to make Viagra.
Like if you and I wanted to go into the

540
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:02,350
Viagra business,
who would have to find out what the key

541
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:04,340
ingredients are,
we'd have to set up a plant and

542
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,174
manufacturing.

543
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,200
I wanted to go into CBD business.
We just have to grow some weed.

544
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,330
Like it's not hard at all.
Okay.

545
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:15,250
So there's a big difference between
extracting cbd or especially medical

546
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:16,590
marijuana,
like giving talks.

547
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,820
If you talk about just thc,
right?

548
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,490
You know,
like cooking it down to a candy form or

549
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,680
a pill form.
It's not hard at all.

550
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,320
Right.
But I would like Glaxo Smith Kline,

551
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,630
you can,
you know,

552
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,240
put a billion dollars into making the
best cbd pill and putting it on the

553
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:35,140
story of every writing the shelf of a
rewrite it and kind of get the

554
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,680
propaganda out there about,
you know,

555
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,070
what it can do,
propaganda being a good thing,

556
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:41,320
getting the marketing out there,
but all of its benefits.

557
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,650
So what is stopping that?
They just can't copyright it.

558
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,130
They can't,
not patentable,

559
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,900
not patentable or it's nature.
It's,

560
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,700
it would be like trying to patent
oranges.

561
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,590
Like you really,
you can't do it.

562
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:53,720
It's not going to work.
People are all going to be able to grow

563
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:54,620
oranges.
Right.

564
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,440
And when it comes to cbd oil,
anyone in this room can grow some

565
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,470
marijuana and extract the CBD from.
It's not an incredibly difficult.

566
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:08,270
It doesn't require massive resources
like it would if you were gonna make

567
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,480
certain types of Alzheimer's medication
that would be.

568
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:14,390
Or Parkinson's medication.
I could say it would be competing with

569
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:16,580
the CBD oil.
Those are very difficult to get and if

570
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:20,810
you can lock down the doctors and make
sure that they only prescribe these

571
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:24,170
pharmaceutical drugs that you guys can
profit from and you're the only ones

572
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,690
that can make it,
then you've got that business locked.

573
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,220
There have been people that have done
calculations about all of the different

574
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,460
pharmaceutical drugs that would be
useless or would be unnecessary,

575
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,680
should say if marijuana was legal and
it's pretty staggering.

576
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,710
It's a long list.
It's a huge list and the amount of

577
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:46,520
profit that the people who make those
pharmaceutical drugs would lose if

578
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:49,580
marijuana became legal and people just
started realizing like,

579
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:50,680
hey,
you know,

580
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,490
there's.
And then the other benefits,

581
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:57,350
like there's no drugs that are like
pharmaceutical drugs that also open you

582
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:59,090
up,
make you a nicer person,

583
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:02,030
make you more friendly and commune and
make me more contemplate of,

584
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:06,350
of your existence a sort of give you a
different perspective that's almost

585
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:08,330
unattainable.
Without those pharmaceutical.

586
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,610
This isn't really right.
It's not that they don't have those

587
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:13,250
additional benefits that the pot does.
That's true.

588
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,680
They don't,
which is oftentimes why it's referred to

589
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,650
as a war on consciousness.
Well,

590
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,190
it's got gotta be.
I mean,

591
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:22,190
that's absolutely what it is because
it's not about drugs because there's so

592
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:24,320
many drugs that are illegal.
I mean,

593
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,270
come on,
we cannot say there is a war on drugs

594
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:29,000
when we can go buy a bottle of whiskey
and get a prescription for oxycontin.

595
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,030
It's insane.
It's insane.

596
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,160
In every restaurant you could buy booze
pretty much every restaurant.

597
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,620
And,
and I mean look what the Oxycontin

598
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:38,120
epidemic has done to America.
I mean,

599
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,760
it's decimated.
It's created a whole generation of

600
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,930
addicts sudden,
you know,

601
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,150
and it's,
it's a dangerous drugs.

602
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:46,580
So it's a,
it's gotten so warren consciousness.

603
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,510
Yeah.
It's.

604
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,580
And it's really a war for profit,
for controlling the ability to profit

605
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,640
off of people altering their
consciousness because people been,

606
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,010
like you said,
other than people that live in frozen

607
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:00,680
places where nothing grows.
They've been trying to alter their

608
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:02,510
consciousness forever.
Okay.

609
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:04,410
But do you believe,
you know,

610
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,100
I don't know what you're a conspiracy
level kind of meter is,

611
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:10,240
but do you believe that,
like with all of this said,

612
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,640
that there is still kind of a secret
kind of conspiracy,

613
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,670
government sanctioned funnel that allows
the illegal drug market to still

614
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,060
flourish in some way in order to keep
certain,

615
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,680
you know,
um,

616
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,680
law enforcement endorsement in order,
you know,

617
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:31,770
maybe skimming off the top off of piles
of cocaine that are coming from Bolivia,

618
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,230
whatever the case may be.

619
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,790
I mean,
I don't know what a case study is,

620
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,990
but you know,
I mean there's still so many coming in

621
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,080
and it's certainly something to be
considered when you.

622
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,460
Are you aware that CIA drug plane that
crashed the jet that had visited

623
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:51,090
Guantanamo Bay a couple of times and it
crashed in Mexico with tons of cocaine

624
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:52,260
on him?
Never seen that.

625
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,970
Jamie.
See if he could pull that up.

626
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,290
CIA plane crashes in Mexico with tons of
cocaine.

627
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:03,260
They overloaded their plane and they had
so much cocaine in it that they,

628
00:27:03,261 --> 00:27:05,970
uh,
they had to a refuel and they tried to

629
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:08,280
land in Mexico and Mexico is like,
fuck you.

630
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,780
Here it is.
CIA.

631
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:12,810
Jet Crashes with four tons of cocaine on
board.

632
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,680
I mean,
this is just last month,

633
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,550
a couple months ago.
September 16th.

634
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,403
Oh,
I missed that one.

635
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,710
Well,
this is a recent one,

636
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:24,930
but it's happened a gang of times.

637
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,681
Yeah.
Okay.

638
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,090
Here it is.
Eight years ago,

639
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,740
saying eight years ago.
Okay.

640
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,120
Okay.
It crashed in the middle of the jungle.

641
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:36,300
And Mexico's Yucatan Kang for tons of
cocaine.

642
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:39,810
The event in the aftermath changed
forever and official narrative of the

643
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:43,650
war on drugs has for years been pushing
the notion that there is no significant

644
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,970
American involvement in the global drug
trade and no American drug lords.

645
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,130
Right.
Well,

646
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:53,070
you know the,
you know the barry seal story only a

647
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,620
little bit.
Very seals who used to fly drugs into

648
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,920
MENA,
Arkansas from South America.

649
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:02,490
You'd go down to South America,
fly drugs and there's photos with him,

650
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:06,360
with all the CIA guys,
and he'd be partying with Noriega down

651
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,820
in Panama,
Panama,

652
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,750
and this guy was just bringing coke into
United States.

653
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:17,751
And then when he was scheduled testify,
they assassinated him in his car on the

654
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:22,080
way the court,
he had had George Bush number in his

655
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:23,190
phone,
in his pocket.

656
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,270
Oh my God.
Yeah.

657
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,720
As he was executed.
So the whole thing is like,

658
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,660
well,
stories over folks go to sleep,

659
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,653
you know.
Um,

660
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,540
Carson,
I'm the Rick Ross documentary.

661
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,480
Yeah,
I've had on the podcast.

662
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,910
What a story.
Amazing story,

663
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,820
man.
I mean that guy can only drug kingpin in

664
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:49,440
La Selling Drugs essentially to fund the
war with the contras and the

665
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:50,310
Sandinistas.
Right.

666
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,250
And they're funneling the product.
Yeah.

667
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,070
Amazing.
He was making millions of dollars for

668
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:58,670
the US government selling coke.
And you know,

669
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,080
Michael Rupert,
who was a good friend of mine to who

670
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,000
killed himself a few years ago,
who had also been on the podcast couple

671
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,530
times.
Michael was the guy that exposed that.

672
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:09,780
He was a Los Angeles,
a detective.

673
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,880
Oh Wow.
And he was a,

674
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:17,140
it was a very famous moment where
Michael Rupert is addressing the court

675
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,430
and he,
he stands up in the middle of this,

676
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,920
all this stuff and,
and says,

677
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:25,560
and exposes this whole deal.
He's like,

678
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,380
I have personally witnessed the CIA
selling drugs in,

679
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,490
in,
in central Los Angeles,

680
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:35,040
in south central Los Angeles.
I haven't seen that.

681
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,400
No.
See if you could find that Jamie's,

682
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,130
it's a fucking crazy video.
Or Watch Michael Rupert a exposes

683
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,470
selling drugs in court.
So why did he kill himself?

684
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,120
He was depressed.
He had,

685
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,760
you know,
had some pretty significant depression

686
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,950
long time,
uh,

687
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,980
you being on the police force and all of
the stuff that he had to deal with and

688
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:59,870
trying to expose corruption.
But listen to this [inaudible] go

689
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:01,270
fullscreen and crank up the volume

690
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,030
because a former Los Angeles police,
narcotics detective that the agency has

691
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:06,500
dealt drugs throughout this country.

692
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,340
This is,
uh,

693
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,920
allegations of CIA involvement in drug
traffic.

694
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:17,880
This is on cspan and this is something
completely unexpected.

695
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:21,750
So when he stood up in front of these
people and said that to the CEO,

696
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,430
pull that up against.
I can see the top of it.

697
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,370
CIA

698
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,690
Director John Deutch.

699
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,580
That is an answer for a lot of you.
And now had your place.

700
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,020
I refer now.
Kenya place.

701
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,123
Wait,
wait,

702
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,410
wait,
wait,

703
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,760
wait a minute.
Why managed care it?

704
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,960
If you don't like what's going on here,
please leave now.

705
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,870
Leave now.
But there are others who do want to hear

706
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:05,510
what's going on in this room.
Please take your time.

707
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,150
Is there another role?
Specific Agency operations known as a

708
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,480
Pegasus and watchtower.
I have watchtower documents heavily

709
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,350
redacted by the agency.
I was personally exposed to CIA

710
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:26,310
operations and recruited by CIA
personnel who attempted to recruit me in

711
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:30,570
the late seventies to become involved in
protecting agency drunk operations in

712
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:33,000
this country.
I have been trying to get this out for

713
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:35,100
18 years and I have the evidence.
My question,

714
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,510
if he was very specific,
sir.

715
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,800
If in the course of the igs
investigations and Fred hits his work,

716
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,790
you'll come across evidence of severely
criminal activity.

717
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,340
It's classified.
Well,

718
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:51,000
you use that classification to hide the
criminal activity or will you tell the

719
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:52,140
American people the truth?

720
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,020
Yeah,
he went through a lot with

721
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,590
and with many other things and just
decided at one point in time he's

722
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,780
suffering too much and took his own man.
That's,

723
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,130
it's really intense.
And,

724
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,660
and you know,
I,

725
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:14,290
I try not to be a snake.
I mean I'm pretty open minded,

726
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,390
you know,
and hopeful guy.

727
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,190
But with what we're kind of moving in
towards with the next administration,

728
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:25,050
I just mean you know about the what's
going on in the Philippines with that

729
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,020
drug.
Yeah.

730
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:29,230
The crazy drug policy and what trump
called him,

731
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,180
you know,
when he was president elect.

732
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:33,390
Yeah.
They see that they spoke and he took,

733
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,830
congratulate them for winning,
for killing people.

734
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,250
And I guess trump said on the call that
he was,

735
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,340
congratulations on this drug policy.
It seems to be working.

736
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,640
Oh my God.
They just assassinating people either

737
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,340
just killing people.
He's.

738
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,020
He's talked pretty openly about how he's
just assassinated.

739
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,160
Just drug addicts and users just killing
drug addicts.

740
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:58,400
That is the.
That's something that happens when you

741
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:03,401
have so many people in one area.
I mean the Philippines is thousands of

742
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:08,510
islands for people who don't know and
they're jammed up with people and I

743
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:11,510
think when you have a lot of crime and
you have a lot of people,

744
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:15,980
you tend to value those people less and
it just becomes.

745
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,140
Especially when you're a dictator,
I mean essentially that guy's a

746
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:21,831
dictator.
Yes.

747
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:22,461
Yes.
I mean,

748
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,870
whether he's elected or not,
he said what he's doing is Barbera

749
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,620
fucking assassinating people have value
people less just based on kind of

750
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:32,870
economic on class,
kind of a class struggle,

751
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,770
class struggle,
and also just the sheer volume of them

752
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:39,260
they're done.
They're not as valuable if there's,

753
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,710
it's like Norway or smaller population
of people.

754
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:44,810
I think it's just value the people more.

755
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,460
I don't know why.
Use Norway's an example.

756
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:47,110
Yeah.
But no,

757
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,920
it's a good.
I mean,

758
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,730
all the Scandinavian countries are good.
Um,

759
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,040
did you see the house we live in?
What does that,

760
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,870
the documentary of war and drugs
documentary?

761
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,730
No,
I didn't say that.

762
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,220
Yeah,
it did.

763
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,750
It did.
Was that about five years ago?

764
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah,
about four or five years ago in so many

765
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,630
of those things.
I can't remember them all anymore.

766
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,960
So many of them now.
Um,

767
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,530
it's a really good one.
And uh,

768
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:05,820
basically like it comes up the,
the,

769
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:09,500
the final hypothesis is that the war on
drugs,

770
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,170
it's a class war,
you know,

771
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,100
originally we thought it was a race war
and it's still partially true,

772
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,560
you know that.
And what's the guy,

773
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:19,760
um,
who,

774
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:23,330
uh,
the first drugs are from the forties and

775
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:24,650
fifties,
I'm forgetting his name,

776
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:27,230
Adelson or whatever,
but who,

777
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:27,950
um,
you know,

778
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,350
it was,
he turned marijuana hysteria in a

779
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,840
Mexican hysteria that they were bringing
it in and this was in the thirties and

780
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:39,530
forties and created reefer madness than
heroin was kind of pushed into the

781
00:34:39,531 --> 00:34:39,950
ghetto.

782
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,780
And Rick Ross.
Harry anslinger.

783
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,770
Yes.
Thank you.

784
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,930
Yeah,
I then crack brought into the ghetto and

785
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:47,540
stuff.
But meth sort of becomes the exception

786
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:51,530
because math is primarily a white
trailer park,

787
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,270
sort of trashy kind of thing and know
how racist I know how racist that was

788
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,420
politically incorrect.
But,

789
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,500
but it's true though.
It's true.

790
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,181
And,
and,

791
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:04,790
and so we kind of,
we do have a class struggle even then

792
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,000
that's a class issue as well and it just
happens to be Caucasian,

793
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,060
but exactly poor people who really get
into the math,

794
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,520
poor people disenfranchise,
disenfranchised,

795
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:14,630
unspoken,
unheard of.

796
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,000
No,
I think there's definitely you could say

797
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,430
that,
that the war on drugs as a class war,

798
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,110
it's all.
But it's also like where can they

799
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,820
extract the money?
Where can they get the money?

800
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,110
Well,
the dea has to,

801
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,480
they have to keep people employed,
you know,

802
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:28,910
and the way to keep people employed is
justify their job.

803
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,940
The way that justify their job is to
continue making arrests and show that

804
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:34,400
you need to make arrests and show you
have to have laws in place,

805
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,380
which is why you know,
that prison guards will,

806
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,050
will,
will lobby to make sure that marijuana

807
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:44,100
stays illegal and other drugs are
strictly enforced.

808
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,800
That the policies are strictly enforced
just so they can continue keeping their

809
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:48,180
jobs right.
Yeah,

810
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,710
absolutely.
But when we still,

811
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,840
like Obama,
during the Obama administration,

812
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:55,200
he did the,
he took the crack cocaine versus powder

813
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:55,810
cocaine.
You know,

814
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,030
the discrepancies from 1:20 to one and
he got it down to whatever it is,

815
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,450
eight to one or something so ridiculous.
Still Insane.

816
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,980
Still saying it's the same drug.
It's the same drought,

817
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,100
but it's,
it's purely based on class and race,

818
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,130
you know?
Yeah.

819
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,410
And,
and that is just,

820
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,020
I mean that,
I mean clearly now,

821
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,810
you know,
as we've seen it and as the rhetoric

822
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:18,780
that's been going on in the last year
during the election cycle,

823
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,680
it's a much bigger problem than we
thought it was.

824
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,850
I mean,
I always knew,

825
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:27,420
we always knew that this was a problem
race and class and stuff,

826
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:29,130
but now straight,
you know,

827
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,860
the table,
all the chips on black and you know,

828
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:33,930
everybody's,
you know,

829
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,530
one of the things that I feel it's
troubling about this election is that a

830
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:40,290
lot of racists,
like my friend Alonzo boat and had a

831
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,630
great quote,
he said not all trump supporters are

832
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:45,600
racist,
but all racists are trump supporters.

833
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,730
And that's right.
That's the,

834
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,660
like the bill Maher credit by
Republicans.

835
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,300
What do you say?
I'm not all Republicans are racist,

836
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:52,770
but all racists are Republicans.
Oh,

837
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:55,560
that's not true though.
There were a lot of racist Democrats.

838
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:58,650
That's a bad quote,
but in a terrible quote,

839
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,850
I don't mean.
I mean maybe there was racist that voted

840
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:04,810
for hilary shore.
Yeah,

841
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,680
I know,
but it's true about,

842
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,340
it's more fun than it is real,
you know,

843
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,440
as a quote,
but it's just,

844
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,910
it seems like they're out in the public
now.

845
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,020
They're out in the open.
I mean,

846
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:21,000
I've seen so many videos of people that
are trump supporters that are using the

847
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:26,001
fact that trump's in office now to like
to say a bunch of real really disgusting

848
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:30,090
racist shit to go crazy and they kind of
got a hall pass,

849
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:30,970
you know?
That's what,

850
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,400
that's a good way of putting it.
Yeah,

851
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:34,050
I mean it was like,
obviously,

852
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,960
you know,
I know people as you do who voted for

853
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:38,100
trump,
sadly I do,

854
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,780
but whatever,
you know,

855
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:43,350
and not all trump supporters are
uneducated,

856
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:45,450
racist,
sort of whatever.

857
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,240
Yes.
I'm going to,

858
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,610
broadly,
for the economics,

859
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,170
some people did it for the economic
thing,

860
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,120
but the fact that they gave those other
people a hall pass to act like that and

861
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:54,690
just,
uh,

862
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,410
just wait,
you know,

863
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,620
really troubling.
Well,

864
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,750
it is,
it's going to be interesting to see this

865
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:03,660
jeff sessions guy,
what he decides to do because the

866
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:06,360
attorney general elect that guy that's
coming in,

867
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,340
is that what you say about um,
Attorney General Electric,

868
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:09,740
a president elect Clinton calling that.

869
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,890
So he's a,
he's a staunch marijuana hater.

870
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,030
He's a,
he's a fucking dyed in the wool

871
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:20,160
marijuana's for bad people.
Kind of guy.

872
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,260
Just got to get that guy.
Hi.

873
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,610
That's all I have to do.
I mean,

874
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:25,290
I know he's probably 80.
Yeah,

875
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,220
it's not too late.
I'm going to get them to skim a little

876
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,300
hit.
Don't fuck them up.

877
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:34,830
Just give him a little and it's just a
little just I,

878
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,020
I'm with you.
And

879
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,520
come on dude,
you'll be fine.

880
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:41,580
Relax.
Let's go sit in the grass up.

881
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,830
This guy just looked different clouds.
You ever look at them that way?

882
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,860
And it's a thin layer of gas.
It separates us from infinity.

883
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,830
What's your favorite music?
Do you like pink floyd?

884
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,730
Pink Floyd up on these headphones on.
Do you like the Beatles?

885
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:56,210
I'm sure you like the Beatles,
right?

886
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,580
Everyone does.
He might not.

887
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,610
It might be one of those weird John
Ashcroft guys.

888
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:02,020
It's really into Gospel music.
Oh yeah.

889
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,700
You remember that John Ashcroft Song,
but what it led to,

890
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,050
God,
look,

891
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,090
she's never sword before.
I think he was one of the scariest guys

892
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:17,221
that ever obtained any sort of office or
had any sort of power through Ashcroft.

893
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,180
You remember what state was?
You're from Missouri maybe.

894
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,800
I think it was from Missouri.
I don't know.

895
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,640
He lost the election for the
governorship to a dead man.

896
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,870
Did he?
Yes.

897
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,360
That's how much people didn't like that
to a dead guy.

898
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,400
Beat him.
And then Bush.

899
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,680
Do you remember when he did he put
coverings over the naked statues,

900
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,040
covered up the boobs and the in the
Rotunda.

901
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,120
So disturbed by their nakedness.
We survived that.

902
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,120
Barely.
I mean we went to a war that's still

903
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:52,120
going on because of that asshole and the
other assholes who are in that

904
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:53,050
administration.
I mean,

905
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:58,051
that administration was a dark,
dark moment of despair and he's a

906
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,760
alleged weapons of mass destruction that
never existed.

907
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:04,630
You know,
all of it.

908
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,030
And now trump has talking to carl rove
again,

909
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,360
but not to Dick Cheney.
He's talking about Dick Cheney's fucking

910
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,010
putting on his darth vader mask again.

911
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,580
Dot.
Yeah.

912
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,630
We should use this moment to say rest in
peace.

913
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:24,631
Carrie Fisher as a just fuck man.
Sixty.

914
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,610
She was only 60.
Oh No.

915
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,410
Did she have a drug problem?
Did she have an alcohol problem?

916
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,060
I'm not current,
but she used to was.

917
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,930
It was a pill thing.
Pills and coke and.

918
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,853
But yeah,
she was,

919
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,540
she was sober in Aa as I understand the
problem is the damage,

920
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:43,990
those goddamned thing that they due to
your cardiovascular system.

921
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:46,450
Oh my God.
Just so devastating.

922
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,880
She lived hard.
She lived hard and I think suffered a

923
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:53,320
lot of physical problems as a result.
And

924
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,300
that was even sadder,
but you've got to think that he probably

925
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:03,301
went out and the wave of Dick's,
just a tsunami of them probably just

926
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,420
exhausted from origins.
Uh,

927
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,650
somehow I just feel like he squeezed in
a lot of life in 53 years I think.

928
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,650
I think you did too.
I mean,

929
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:19,270
Pun intended or unintended back George.
Yeah.

930
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:20,490
But with guys like that,
I,

931
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,600
I often wonder,
you know,

932
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:26,230
with being a songwriter or I hit maker,
is it,

933
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,770
is it better to have had,
you know,

934
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:34,830
one hit or a few hits and then
completely fade away?

935
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,260
Not that he faded away into obscurity,
maybe he's not a good example or to not

936
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:43,460
have it at all because I think George
did kind of carry with him that like he

937
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:46,190
was no longer current sort of thing.
Yeah,

938
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,860
that's a weird thing where someone's not
famous anymore.

939
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,950
They're kind of a joke.
Whereas a regular person,

940
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,210
not a joke.
Like,

941
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,880
here's an example.
Do you remember when Gary Coleman was a

942
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:57,750
security guard?
He had a,

943
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,850
he had to get a job and it was a real
problem because Gary Coleman was just

944
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:04,280
trying to do his job and just trying to
get paid so he can eat,

945
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,020
you know,
it was just trying to feed himself like

946
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,980
all the rest of us.

947
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,580
And people would come up to him and take
pictures of them and mock him and they

948
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:14,120
would use him as a joke.
But you don't use a regular security

949
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:16,310
guard as a joke.
Like if you see a regular security

950
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:16,671
guard,
you're like,

951
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:17,570
what's up man?
How you doing?

952
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:19,040
Yeah.
I'm going to go this building right

953
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,060
here.
Who See your id?

954
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,080
Cool.
Everything's fine.

955
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,140
You don't say,
ah,

956
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,830
you're a fucking security guard.
Look at Joe.

957
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,090
Because he used to be something greater,
you know?

958
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

959
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:33,290
There's a poor Gary Coleman.
He was a security guard.

960
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,300
Yeah.
That's so troubling.

961
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:40,310
And it kind of really plays into the
whole idea of fame and perversion and

962
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:42,320
America and the things that we hold
dear.

963
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:45,020
The things that are valuable to us,
kind of the American,

964
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,280
that disillusion of American values,
which I think that's the rise of trump.

965
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:50,600
To me,
it's a values thing.

966
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,800
I had a guy gave me a hard time once
about not about fear factor being

967
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:59,801
canceled and he was a.
I'm a fucking a here at cvs.

968
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,330
He was working at cvs.
He's like,

969
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:06,050
what happened to his show?
And I said it was canceled no more.

970
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,200
Show her like,
like all attitude.

971
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:09,034
I'm like,
dude,

972
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,470
shows go away.
Yeah.

973
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,140
They go on and then they get canceled.
We had was,

974
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,310
we had a good run me,
but he was like,

975
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,070
he was being aggressive about it.
It was so weird.

976
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:20,270
It was like,
what?

977
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,170
Just bizarre detachment from reality.
You're working at fucking cvs dude.

978
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,960
Like I'm not giving you a hard time
about being a cvs guy.

979
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,800
Right?
But if,

980
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,430
if I was the guy from fear factor and
then I was a cvs guy,

981
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,990
how bad would you shit on me.
Then I'm just coming in as a guy buying

982
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,930
some cough drops.

983
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,630
That's right.
Like what a weird thing that we have

984
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:40,250
this,
this need to.

985
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:44,210
When someone attains a very high status
and then falls off of that,

986
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,630
what we think we think they're down.
We want to attack.

987
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,430
It's like a,
an animal thing.

988
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,530
But in your case,
best thing that ever happened to you?

989
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,260
Yeah.
I mean I don't think he knew.

990
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,820
You know,
he probably didn't know that it had a

991
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:57,950
standup career that I was doing the UFC
or anything.

992
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:58,551
He was just like,
oh,

993
00:43:58,551 --> 00:43:59,450
you're a fucking loser.
No,

994
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,630
what is your show?
I was like crazy accent.

995
00:44:02,631 --> 00:44:03,550
All aggressive.
Like,

996
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:05,140
all right dude.
Like that is.

997
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,430
It was like.
But it was so blatant.

998
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:09,860
It was confusing.
It was like I being pumped.

999
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,820
Yeah.
And,

1000
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,830
and,
and the idea of like a,

1001
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,640
uh,
you know,

1002
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,710
winning that idea,
you've got to win,

1003
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:19,340
man.
That trumps trump thing.

1004
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:23,990
That's the trump thing that's really
disturbing is that that winning thing

1005
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,130
got a win,
got to win.

1006
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:26,930
And not this lack of person.
I mean,

1007
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:30,590
he's fucking 70 man.
That ain't a lot of time left bro.

1008
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,580
I,
if you're super lucky,

1009
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:35,640
you got 20 summers left.
If you're super lucky,

1010
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:38,410
if everything goes great and he's not
that healthy,

1011
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,470
he's fat is fat.
His Chin just has like a very slow

1012
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,500
sloping lab of skin that's loosely
attached to his neck.

1013
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:52,920
That goes down to his collarbone and he
doesn't look like a healthy 70 year old.

1014
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,890
And I don't think so either.
Sylvester stallone is older than him.

1015
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,900
That's a good piece of A.
Yeah,

1016
00:44:57,901 --> 00:44:59,130
there you go.
Put it in perspective.

1017
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:01,220
Sean connery total of both of them.
Yeah,

1018
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,740
they're both older than that.
That whole idea.

1019
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:07,710
It's just that destruction of sort of
like the things that we have instilled

1020
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,730
as being an important.

1021
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,320
Like you could have a winning
temperament.

1022
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:14,820
I'm going to make America win again.
Why is that the most important sort of

1023
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:19,140
attribute for someone to attain to what
does that even mean when and it's so

1024
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:21,360
attached to like a financial thing,
right?

1025
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,650
Like what kind of value system is that?
Like there are other ways to quote

1026
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:26,550
unquote win at,
into time.

1027
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:28,740
It'd be tied to money,
but the problem is it becomes

1028
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:30,000
attractive.
You know,

1029
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:33,840
when you see someone who has a slick
back hair and a private jet and he takes

1030
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:38,700
a photo with his expensive shoes on his
private jet and it's on his instagram

1031
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:39,690
and then he's,
you know,

1032
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,560
that all stuff becomes very attractive
and then people aspire to that and then,

1033
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:45,990
you know,
you get that Gordon Gekko greed is good

1034
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,970
thing you write,
greed is good,

1035
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:50,520
but also like that level of aspiration.

1036
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,860
First of all,
it's pretty much not attainable.

1037
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,750
I mean mullins.
Attainable.

1038
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,210
Yeah.
Put One or what to private jet rich.

1039
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:58,530
I mean that is.
Some people can do it.

1040
00:45:58,531 --> 00:46:01,110
They obviously have one percent of the,
one percent of percent.

1041
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:02,600
I mean that level,
you know,

1042
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,340
like the people were following the,
those people on instagram and instagram

1043
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:09,390
who have instagram.
Okay,

1044
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:14,391
Grandpa fucking the on that series of
tubes.

1045
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,560
It's a series of tubes.
God dammit.

1046
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,890
Right?
The facebook.

1047
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,940
Um,
but I mean if you're trying to climb the

1048
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:25,110
mountain,
you want to climb everest.

1049
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:28,350
If you want to be the Gordon Gekko Guy,
you want a private jet and the slicked

1050
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:32,160
back hair and the put it never ends.
It doesn't ever indifference.

1051
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,930
Well,
that's weird when you see the really,

1052
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:37,500
really,
really rich guys who are still smashing

1053
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,060
and just every day trying to attain new
and we always assume they achieved

1054
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:44,010
enlightenment was like this idea that
like,

1055
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:46,320
well he's got $50,
billion dollars.

1056
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,590
Why doesn't he just retired?
He never fucking retire to read Steve

1057
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:50,160
Jobs.
Last words.

1058
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,270
Have you ever read that?
No.

1059
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:52,740
Let me say you might want to bring them
up,

1060
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,491
Jamie.
It's really,

1061
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:55,200
really fucking cool.
It's like he's,

1062
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,580
it's his last,
whatever mean,

1063
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,000
maybe not the last word he said to his
wife or something,

1064
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,100
but it's kind of his last cohesive
thought was like,

1065
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:02,934
look,
I'm,

1066
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,150
you know,
many people,

1067
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,400
the world views me as completely
successful and,

1068
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,380
and I've achieved so much in business,
but you know,

1069
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,260
my personal life and everything that he
was lacking,

1070
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,080
you know,
so he was just Kinda sorta coming clean

1071
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:19,140
about the imbalance and it all kind of
coming clean about the,

1072
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,720
you know,
the levels of discontent in the path of

1073
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:23,610
the heart,
the soul,

1074
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:26,700
the path of the spirit.
Because he was essentially a spiritual

1075
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:30,040
guy and you know,
with a meditator is practitioner of Zen

1076
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:33,460
and into Neem Karoli Baba and all sorts
of things.

1077
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,460
But he got so wrapped up in those
vicious sort of cycle of having to

1078
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,500
produce product,
product,

1079
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:44,020
product and you know,
apple essentially in,

1080
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:45,430
in his words,
you know,

1081
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:50,431
he made it into a product company and
that's how we defined it.

1082
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:54,130
And not even an idea company was a
product company.

1083
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:58,210
And then products are based on having to
have the latest version of the product

1084
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:00,790
over and over and over again,
and he just got wrapped up in kind of

1085
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,300
lost his soul isn't an interesting in
that like bill,

1086
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,970
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were like the
two competitors that we always thought

1087
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:08,830
of.
Bill Gates was thought to be the

1088
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:13,600
business guy who's the cold hard and he
was a lot of ways.

1089
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,110
Sure back in the day,
but if you look at him in his older

1090
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:19,300
years,
he became very charitable,

1091
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:24,301
involved in a bunch of humanitarian
efforts and does a lot of amazing work

1092
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:29,401
and is using his substantial wealth for
a lot of good and doesn't work anymore.

1093
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,170
It's just he's done with all that.
He's all just doing humanitarian work

1094
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:34,420
and helping people,
which is kind of beautiful.

1095
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,410
And he became,
you know,

1096
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,460
this different guy.
As he got older he became wiser and

1097
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:44,461
became much more involved in doing good
and trying to help and trying to use

1098
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:49,270
that immense amount of money that he
acquired by being a ruthless sort of

1099
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:51,730
business gangster,
but doing it for good.

1100
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:54,910
Which is kind of really fascinating.
Then he decided,

1101
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:56,050
hey,
I'm going to step back here.

1102
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:59,140
I'm going to set,
set back and think about what I'm doing

1103
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:01,120
and what's really important.
I mean,

1104
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,660
this last stage of life.
And that's a,

1105
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:04,900
you know,
that's Karma Yoga.

1106
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,580
Karma Yoga is,
you know,

1107
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,320
about the um,
uh,

1108
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,670
you know,
what to the path of the Saudi in,

1109
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,370
in India,
like traditionally the path of the saw,

1110
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,880
do you know,
kind of historically.

1111
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,260
And traditionally it's some,
you know,

1112
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,280
the who grows up as born in India and is
raised into education event,

1113
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,950
become a householder,
householder,

1114
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:29,710
meaning getting married and has kids.
I'm works as career provides for the

1115
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:32,650
kids.
And then in the last third of his life

1116
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,830
becomes a Saudi drops.
All of it walks away.

1117
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,660
Kids are grown up,
out of the house,

1118
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:41,500
kind of leaves of his wife,
which is kind of a bummer for her,

1119
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,300
but for her.
But in kind of a concept,

1120
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:46,510
maybe she was annoying.
Maybe she wanted to keep wanting to

1121
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:48,070
leave anywhere verses and shit.
And he's like,

1122
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,120
no,
we have to meditate.

1123
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,500
No,
I'm shopping online,

1124
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:56,170
but they need to take off and it becomes
a wandering then to India and that's the

1125
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:56,921
path of this.
I'll do.

1126
00:49:56,921 --> 00:49:58,750
It's kind of broken into different
phases.

1127
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,670
I don't know if that's the right way to
do it either.

1128
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,593
Oh,
I don't know,

1129
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,670
but it's fascinating.
It's an interesting.

1130
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,950
It's an interesting way of,
of,

1131
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,160
of looking at it that,
okay,

1132
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:09,100
you have achieved a lot.
You've accumulated a lot and now I can

1133
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:10,620
go be of service.
Well,

1134
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,040
service is always a great idea.
Um,

1135
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,340
wasn't the Saudis are really into Hash,
right?

1136
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:19,270
Isn't that the big thing?
I'll make chillums you can smell it.

1137
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,910
Depends what a,
what a lineage you belong to.

1138
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:26,911
I've sat with some of them in the Naga
Baba is and the Colombo Mineola and part

1139
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,190
of sat with them.
It is amazing how when people discussed

1140
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,870
religion,
if they discuss hinduism or the Sikhs or

1141
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:38,570
any,
any of the various strains of,

1142
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:43,670
of religions that are inexorably
connected to psychedelics,

1143
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,600
psychedelics are rarely discussed.
You know,

1144
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:52,601
I mean if you go and you read like the
vimanas or read any of the ancient Hindu

1145
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:57,680
text,
there's so many references to soma and

1146
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:02,240
so many references to what is obviously
some sort of a psychoactive substance,

1147
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,590
you know this.

1148
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:08,590
But when people talk about like Hinduism
and hardly ever comes up,

1149
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:13,820
can you talk about Yogis and dues,
it hardly ever comes up in the modern

1150
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,670
sort of take on it because there have
been a,

1151
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,700
there's kind of a revival of within
Hinduism have kind of an Orthodox

1152
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,750
version of it,
which is,

1153
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,420
you know,
and free and that's sort of,

1154
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,970
that's kind of a modern revival within
the Hindu tradition,

1155
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,070
you know,
so they've kind of pushed that aside.

1156
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,420
But yeah,
I mean,

1157
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,220
you know,
a bong is the,

1158
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:37,760
it's the,
it's like a powdery pot thing that you

1159
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,910
just kind of,
you know,

1160
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:40,280
you swallow some of it.
Yeah.

1161
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:42,620
How does that,
what does that stuff made with its,

1162
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:46,250
um,
you take like the leaves and you grind

1163
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:49,760
up the leaves into a fine powder.
Then there's some kind of cooking

1164
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:52,760
process and then,
but within just the leaves,

1165
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,640
the shake,
all the scraps is enough and you can

1166
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:59,690
extract the thc in some kind of cooking
process and you make it into a fine

1167
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:02,780
powder and just throw it down,
throw it down,

1168
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:03,350
and it hadn't.

1169
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,360
It gets you pretty,
pretty toasty.

1170
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:06,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

1171
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,430
Well I know that there are also into the
crystals and they take the crystals and

1172
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:13,910
mash them up and sort of make like kind
of a hash out of,

1173
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:14,990
uh,
the,

1174
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,580
the scrape from the thc crystals.
What is that called?

1175
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,850
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah.

1176
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:26,420
We both know some sort of a mushy sort
of waxy type jazz.

1177
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,010
They'd take that.
Yeah.

1178
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,060
But I mean,
again,

1179
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:32,240
back to the original thread of our
conversation,

1180
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,700
it's like every tradition has some kind
of Sacrum,

1181
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,040
a mind altering sacrament,
vedic texts,

1182
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,060
all these different.
Uh,

1183
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,990
I mean they look,
I mean they had to be,

1184
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,910
they,
they obviously were aware of these

1185
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,370
substances and they found these
substances.

1186
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:51,440
There was no science back then.
There was no real understanding of

1187
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,170
what's going on in the world.
No real understanding of your body,

1188
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,710
but there was these,
this access to this stuff.

1189
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,690
Hey man,
you see those things that are grown on

1190
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:03,200
that couch it if you take that,
you will meet God.

1191
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,690
Right?
And then people did it and did meet God

1192
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:06,560
and they're like,
Holy Shit.

1193
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:09,770
You're telling the truth.
Like there is like everybody wants.

1194
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,970
Like if you think about religions,
if you think about the stories that

1195
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,410
people tell of the wise men and were,
you know,

1196
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,390
the experience,
the burning Bush and God gives them the

1197
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,900
10 commandments and all these different
things that happen.

1198
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,550
There are all sorts of beautiful
stories,

1199
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,960
but your everyday life experiences so
flat and fucking boring.

1200
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,380
And then you do take these things and
go,

1201
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,820
well,
this is just gonna be just like

1202
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:38,190
everything else,
just flat and boring and bullshit.

1203
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,980
And he take,
take those mushrooms that you pluck off

1204
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:42,270
that cow shit and all of a sudden,

1205
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,120
oh,
it's

1206
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,120
exposed to you in some grand way.
And then your whole life becomes about

1207
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:53,140
worshiping that.
I mean,

1208
00:53:53,141 --> 00:53:56,320
that's.
Mckenna always argued that,

1209
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,400
um,
the,

1210
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,770
all the ancient cattle worshiping,
um,

1211
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,490
religions and cattle worshiping
civilizations like to talk to all he

1212
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:08,800
took and all these really old,
old cultures that that's what was all

1213
00:54:08,801 --> 00:54:10,930
about,
that these people had found out that

1214
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:14,870
cows grow mushrooms on their shit and
that they,

1215
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,380
they weren't able to differentiate
between the,

1216
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,300
they thought it was coming out of the
cow's body,

1217
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,090
the cow would shit it out and they
didn't understand sports.

1218
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,820
So they thought it was inside the cow
and it would grow in the shed.

1219
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:27,150
And that was your portal to God.
Wow.

1220
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,260
Wow.
Be rarely hear that discussed.

1221
00:54:29,261 --> 00:54:31,990
I mean you always hear it discussed in
terms of like an agricultural and

1222
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,320
resource that that's why they worship
the cows,

1223
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,580
you know,
that not just makes me think it goes

1224
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:37,710
back to that,
you know,

1225
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,890
and I'm someone who I'm a very spiritual
person and have a practice and all that

1226
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:42,400
kind of stuff.

1227
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,530
But like that just brings up the
question to me,

1228
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:48,910
it's like,
did we invent God as a result of those

1229
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,780
experiences?
Kind of like a good.

1230
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,320
Chris Ryan,
if he was here,

1231
00:54:53,321 --> 00:54:55,420
you know,
kind of like the hunter gatherer kind of

1232
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,900
tribal,
you know,

1233
00:54:56,901 --> 00:55:01,360
when we were just starting starting to
learn to depict our experiences and talk

1234
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:05,140
about our experiences and creating like
an oral history and sort of like the

1235
00:55:05,141 --> 00:55:10,141
first kind of existential dilemmas and
which many say came from psychedelic

1236
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:15,550
awareness back in those days.
So is that what led to the creation of

1237
00:55:15,551 --> 00:55:18,370
God and you know,
and to me it doesn't make a difference.

1238
00:55:18,371 --> 00:55:21,790
Being a believer of God.
I don't really care if it's real or myth

1239
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,260
or not.
It works for me,

1240
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,260
but it does make.
It almost doesn't matter.

1241
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:29,380
It doesn't matter if it benefits you to
believe in it,

1242
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,310
it benefits you.

1243
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,170
People ask me that all the time,
like,

1244
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,570
oh my God,
you actually believe in flying monkeys

1245
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:39,550
and a blue guy playing a flute and in
the fields I've seen flying monkeys.

1246
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,940
Shit.
Those people talking shit.

1247
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,710
I've seen jokers giving me the finger.
They're spinning and geometric patterns

1248
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,320
that were infinite.
I've seen a lot of shit that's way more

1249
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:54,600
ridiculous than a guy with a harp and
not only have you seen it and have I

1250
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,830
seen it,
but I can tell everybody listening how

1251
00:55:56,831 --> 00:55:57,664
to see it.
Yeah,

1252
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,140
they can see.
You can see it.

1253
00:55:59,141 --> 00:56:00,970
If you have the courage and the
substances,

1254
00:56:00,971 --> 00:56:01,801
you can see it.
Yes,

1255
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:05,470
you can and it works on everybody.
Except I think it's the DMT apparently

1256
00:56:05,471 --> 00:56:09,030
doesn't work on everybody because like
one out of a thousand or it like

1257
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,020
literally doesn't do shit.
Jamie.

1258
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:14,710
Jamie doesn't get high off of edibles.
This fucking freak over here.

1259
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,530
He give Jamie like a super powerful
edible.

1260
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,270
Barely does a goddamn thing to him.
Yeah.

1261
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:24,290
It took like 1200 milligrams before a
concert and drove home two hours later.

1262
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,260
The edibles today in my.
He's afraid to Goddamn Halligan working

1263
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:34,840
the controls over there.
I mean for the first time in my life I

1264
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:37,420
feel like kind of finally like an old
hippie.

1265
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,350
Like,
oh my God,

1266
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,710
the edibles when I was a kid.
It's not like that today,

1267
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:43,600
man.
That shit's insane.

1268
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,840
These fucking things.
This is a jumbo spray.

1269
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:50,770
I took 10 hits of this before maybe 12,
I forget,

1270
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,340
for a Sam Harris' podcast I was.
I was like,

1271
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:59,370
I was skiing downhill straight with.
I wasn't crashing,

1272
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:04,150
but I was figuring out how to barely
stay up the entire conversation.

1273
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:05,980
I'm like,
what in the fuck have I done?

1274
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:09,250
I was so high.
It was probably as high as I've ever

1275
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:11,060
been in my life.
Was at the last seminar,

1276
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,950
spoke to Sam.
Sam's a perfect guy to be that baked

1277
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:18,550
with because all you have to do is just
wind them up and say something and he's

1278
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:22,210
so eloquent that he could just continue
to go on these amazing as long as you

1279
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,650
keep up with what he's saying.

1280
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,990
So you have like good questions.
He is,

1281
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:29,320
but I.
and it's all due respect to stem and I

1282
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,570
do think you're smarter than me in terms
of Iq,

1283
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:36,340
but I do think he uses head intelligence
to kind of Kinda shuck and jive you a

1284
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:37,660
little bit.
Shuck and jive household.

1285
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,160
Well,
I'm not like.

1286
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,130
I mean,
he's so smart and so articulate and

1287
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,820
bright,
obviously brilliant and mad respect for

1288
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:48,130
him,
but I just don't think he's right about

1289
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:48,881
what.
Well,

1290
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:51,520
let's take Islam for example.
I mean there's so many things,

1291
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:52,770
but I mean,
um,

1292
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,920
uh,
Islam and it's sort of like the right to

1293
00:57:56,921 --> 00:58:00,850
sort of like prepare for violence.
Um,

1294
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:03,460
and kind of self defense.
I don't really agree with that

1295
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,710
philosophy.
Um,

1296
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,200
and I just,
I don't agree with it because I think if

1297
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:11,140
you,
it just invites the consciousness into

1298
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:13,930
your head to where you are going to have
to use it.

1299
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:19,340
I'm not interested in the idea that self
defense and preparing for something sets

1300
00:58:20,591 --> 00:58:25,591
up the stage to make something happen
different than say getting in there in

1301
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:28,180
the octagon and the MMA stuff and you
know,

1302
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,310
well that's a competition the
competition.

1303
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,540
But you think like maybe like guy walks
around with a gun and a knife and I

1304
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:37,300
think it will improve vest and get
invites the consciousness into,

1305
00:58:37,301 --> 00:58:40,630
into,
into the atmosphere and it creates the

1306
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:43,990
energetic cycle of having to use that.
And then Sam kind of throws up those

1307
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:47,290
statistics that well,
it's about the same odds as having a car

1308
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:52,291
crash or as you are going to experience
some kind of act of violence in your

1309
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,360
life where you will need to learn how
to,

1310
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,690
I dunno,
do something self defend yourself and I

1311
00:58:58,750 --> 00:58:59,890
just,
I don't.

1312
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,150
Maybe you can throw at that math to me
and I think it depends on certain

1313
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:07,120
socioeconomic conditions,
but I just don't think that's true.

1314
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,120
I just don't want that consciousness in
my life and I don't think we should need

1315
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:16,990
to dissolve that consciousness.
I certainly think you're free to not

1316
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:21,140
have those thoughts in your head and to
choose to take the path of love and

1317
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:24,320
acceptance and just passively and move
through this life.

1318
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:29,321
But the reality of human beings is like,
I've been unfortunately watching some

1319
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:32,240
videos online.
I watched this video today,

1320
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:35,450
have a guy kicking some lady down the
stairs for no reason.

1321
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,700
He was behind her and then they're
looking out for.

1322
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,950
They're trying to find him in the UK.
They've got photos of him,

1323
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,540
but he just,
she was walking in front of them.

1324
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,170
Don't go on the stairs and he walked up
behind her and just,

1325
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:49,430
just a random person kicked her down
this flight of stairs and she's horribly

1326
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:51,040
injured.
And uh,

1327
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,500
I,
I've seen a bunch of those things do

1328
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:54,950
happen.

1329
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:57,440
You can run into the wrong people.
Yes they do.

1330
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,860
They do have you,
um,

1331
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,270
steven pinker,
minerals,

1332
01:00:00,271 --> 01:00:02,240
Angel Story,
you know,

1333
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:03,074
we are in,
yes,

1334
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,780
those things happen and look around the
world today and flip on the news and

1335
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:09,680
it's highly disturbing.
But we are living in the most peaceful

1336
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:11,330
time.
Amazing time of our,

1337
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:12,500
of our existence.
You know,

1338
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:16,010
if you were a 30 year old man in the
year 1500,

1339
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,120
you're most,
the highest cause of death was not

1340
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,410
disease or infection.
That was an act of violence.

1341
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,980
You were going to be raping and
pillaging and you just had to defend

1342
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:29,060
your food supply for Granuloma.
And we have come to some kind of

1343
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:32,300
understanding,
some kind of collective consciousness

1344
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:36,530
that has morphed itself together in the
form of cooperation.

1345
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,340
We have to shit.
And there's so many of us know and it's

1346
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:41,000
getting more of us.

1347
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,280
The planet is getting smaller.
We have to cooperate,

1348
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,620
I agree with you,
but what do you do with those guys that

1349
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:47,390
kick women down flights of stairs like
that?

1350
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,850
Um,
you,

1351
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:54,950
I mean,
I guess there's some sort of forum of

1352
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,240
um,
you know,

1353
01:00:56,270 --> 01:01:00,230
I guess punishment and we do have a,
we live in a society where law and order

1354
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:02,900
is maybe a necessary evil.
And I,

1355
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:03,591
I,
you know,

1356
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:07,070
and I'm sure there's some kind of like
incarceration,

1357
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,890
but ultimately,
you know,

1358
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,390
you got to love them.
You've got to have compassion for them

1359
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:15,560
and you've got to just teach them with
compassion that their action was wrong.

1360
01:01:15,561 --> 01:01:17,270
Don't kick the lady down the stairs,
man,

1361
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,510
here's why you shouldn't do that and I
love you and it's going to be okay.

1362
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,060
People right now are up in arms.
They want to kick your ass.

1363
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:23,560
That's cool.

1364
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,830
It was a right now in Nebraska,
like this fucking happy fucking Tim

1365
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:32,831
leary.
Pussy kick is a kick his ass.

1366
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:35,150
He pass,
but you know,

1367
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:37,940
and I'm a on a different,
you know,

1368
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,300
it's a beautiful thought.
It is.

1369
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,470
It's gone.
Be there.

1370
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:44,390
Is there some people that you can run
into though?

1371
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:48,260
Unfortunately you're better off.
It's like that expression about having a

1372
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:50,450
gun.
You're better off having it,

1373
01:01:50,451 --> 01:01:52,670
not needing it then needing it and not
having it.

1374
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,081
Yeah,
I don't,

1375
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:55,610
I don't agree.
So I get it.

1376
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,370
I get it.
And I understand the arguments about

1377
01:01:58,371 --> 01:02:01,040
that guy who was a.
was it in um,

1378
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,880
I think it was in Minnesota.
He was running around stabbing people

1379
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:09,680
and then some guy who was a concealed
carry permit holder pulled out his gun

1380
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:12,000
and shot the guy and killed them.
And it was a,

1381
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,460
one of those things that people point to
like,

1382
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:15,380
Hey,
this guy was a competition shooter

1383
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,770
concealed carry permit and any save
people's lives because this guy was

1384
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,190
killing a bunch of people.

1385
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,820
But those case studies compared to the
case studies that go wrong,

1386
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,700
I don't know what they are.
I don't have the metrics,

1387
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,600
but I bet there what 10 to 1:20 to one.
Sure.

1388
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,000
It's,
it's way easier to get a gun just to

1389
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:36,060
just to go and get a gun than it is to
become a competitive shooter.

1390
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,540
Like what that guy was,
was the rarest of the rare.

1391
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,760
Someone is not just competent with a
firearm,

1392
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:44,880
but an expert level.
Here he is man who shot crossroads mall.

1393
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:48,600
Terrorists is us p,
s a competitor.

1394
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:50,220
Three guns shooter.
Yeah.

1395
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:53,730
So this guy is just a bad ass gun
carrier and that's fine.

1396
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:57,270
But that is the rarest except right.
I'm positive of it.

1397
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,171
Right.
But it is real,

1398
01:02:58,171 --> 01:02:59,004
right?
Sure.

1399
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,980
So it can happen.
So he was right.

1400
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,810
So his thought was one day if I am
carrying a gun,

1401
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,370
I'll be able to save people's lives.

1402
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,390
That's,
that's,

1403
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,130
that's fine.
And I and protect myself.

1404
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:11,993
Okay.
I get that.

1405
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,460
But the hundreds of others that go
along,

1406
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,690
then somehow there's so many loopholes
in the system of crazy people who get

1407
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:21,860
guns and go to sandy hook and it's,
it's,

1408
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,000
it's slow.
That's a terrible example.

1409
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:27,180
I'm not worth.
And those are illegally acquired gun.

1410
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,720
That's a gun that was acquired by a
person who is mentally ill and his

1411
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,330
parents didn't protect the guns.
Yeah,

1412
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:34,710
that's,
that's a different story.

1413
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:35,610
But yeah,
you're right.

1414
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,970
You know,
I just think that the risk versus reward

1415
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:41,490
is just,
it's just far too unbalanced,

1416
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:45,450
but it's definitely it.
The ability to shoot someone and kill

1417
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:48,810
someone by pulling that little tiny
muscle on your finger is kind of crazy.

1418
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,380
I mean it's the amount of power that you
have in doing so.

1419
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:55,260
It is,
that's a glitch in the matrix using

1420
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:56,690
matrix analogy,
but it is,

1421
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,500
it's a glitch in the matrix man and it
just,

1422
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:02,580
it plays into kind of every fallacy of
the human condition,

1423
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,260
you know,
and it's like why?

1424
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,400
How did we let that happen?
How did we make it so easy to take

1425
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:11,550
someone else's life?
So what do you say if I may.

1426
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:13,590
Exactly.
Are you the president of United States?

1427
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,280
Does the,
does Zach Larry say no more military

1428
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,730
disaster.
He say police officers can't have guns.

1429
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,920
We all need love.
Everybody gets their guns taken away.

1430
01:04:22,921 --> 01:04:24,630
Like what do you,
how do you deal with everything?

1431
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,200
Yeah,
I mean,

1432
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,510
I mean,
and it's not something that you can just

1433
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:28,980
do it.
Yeah.

1434
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:30,360
It's not something you can just do
overnight.

1435
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,500
I'm not,
I'm not,

1436
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,110
you know,
naive enough or you know,

1437
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:37,640
stoned enough or meditate enough to
think that that we should get high,

1438
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,940
maybe we think about in a different way
and there,

1439
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:44,400
and there were already 300 million guns
in America.

1440
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,490
I think there's more.
I think there are more guns in America

1441
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:48,510
than there are human beings.

1442
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,570
And here's what's crazy.
It's not like we're like,

1443
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,320
well,
we're good.

1444
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,360
No,
we're fucking making guns like crazy.

1445
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,160
Well,
as we're sitting here,

1446
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:57,090
the chunk,
chunk,

1447
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:57,940
chunk,
chunk,

1448
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,390
chunk,
machines are turning out gun.

1449
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:02,580
But yes,
exactly who becomes president.

1450
01:05:02,581 --> 01:05:06,510
I know it's highly unpopular and people
will get pissed at me,

1451
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:11,400
but we stopped the sale of all.
Unless you have a very specific kind of

1452
01:05:11,401 --> 01:05:15,060
UK style hunting exceptions.
Do you eat meat?

1453
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,490
I do.
You do?

1454
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,270
I didn't for awhile,
but I do again.

1455
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:21,640
Why'd you start again?
Um,

1456
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,980
I got sick.
I'm not from not eating meat.

1457
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:24,814
I just,
um,

1458
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,970
I got this terrible flu and it was just
really,

1459
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:29,150
really sick and just like,
you know,

1460
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,100
not a cold.
I mean it was like a terrible flu and

1461
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:35,260
all I could think about was I want a
Turkey sandwich

1462
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,633
cheese.
Huh.

1463
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:38,860
And I was like fuck it.

1464
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:42,940
And I had a Turkey sandwich and I felt
better and I never went back.

1465
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,920
Wow.
Eat everything.

1466
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,210
Burgers,
everything.

1467
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:47,410
The whole deal.
I kind of do.

1468
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:52,930
Do you eat factory farmed food?
I really,

1469
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:53,591
really,
really,

1470
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:55,570
really try not to.
But you do?

1471
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:56,941
I do.
I mean,

1472
01:05:56,941 --> 01:05:58,660
I can't say that I don't,
but I don't.

1473
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,900
I mean in the most dire emergency I give
you super hungry,

1474
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,440
super hungry.
You know what I do is I'm an,

1475
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:07,530
I have to,
it's kind of a,

1476
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:12,940
a loosely in the airport,
a god Damn airport you got me in the

1477
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:14,710
airport and I'm just like,
whatever.

1478
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:17,290
I always get to the airport way too
early because I just,

1479
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:19,450
I liked being in the airport early.
I like to be in that.

1480
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:24,430
It's like a neutral zone between there
and here and just I love it.

1481
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,440
I love hanging around the airport and I
get there.

1482
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,910
I'm hungry and I'm just it in like the.
I used to fuck up at the airport all the

1483
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:33,370
time with blueberry muffins,
chocolate croissants.

1484
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:38,230
That was my shit and I'm a sucker for
the egg mcmuffin.

1485
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,270
Sadly.
Those are good.

1486
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,610
They taste good.
That's not the worst thing in the world

1487
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:43,600
for you,
quite honestly.

1488
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,010
No,
it's not for the.

1489
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,590
The Ham factory farm.
Yeah.

1490
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:48,520
It's not the worst thing in the world
for,

1491
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,060
but Mcdonald's is the devil.
But what am I going to do?

1492
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,780
Well,
it's the best I can really do.

1493
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,580
Yeah.
It's a weird world.

1494
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,050
Well,
a lot of vegans would disagree with

1495
01:06:59,051 --> 01:06:59,561
that.
They would say,

1496
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:00,880
well,
you definitely not doing the best you

1497
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:03,170
can if you're out there eating egg.
That's true.

1498
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,170
That's not the best you can.
That's fair.

1499
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,000
Fair enough.
Oh God.

1500
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:07,863
No.
Meat.

1501
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,620
Vegans and I argue a lot.
Do they do?

1502
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,633
Yeah.
Yeah.

1503
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:14,350
A lot.
When you are on the social media,

1504
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:15,910
um.
Well,

1505
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:16,940
and,
and,

1506
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,290
and it's weird because I'm kind of
philosophically,

1507
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:23,200
I'm on their side.
I'm with philosophically,

1508
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:25,460
but not in practice.
I just add to,

1509
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,810
it doesn't feel I'm not quite ready for
that and I have to admit I'm just not,

1510
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,040
you know,
I am where I am.

1511
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,340
I am,
but what I argued with him about is,

1512
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,170
um,
it's,

1513
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:37,810
it's a constant social media argument is
that we are omnivores.

1514
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,280
We are,
yeah.

1515
01:07:39,281 --> 01:07:41,440
We definitely are omnivores.
We eat what's around us.

1516
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,670
Yeah.
We always have.

1517
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,800
There's a way to,
you can cruelty free meat,

1518
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:47,560
but there's a way.
There's not a way where you could have

1519
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:52,561
cruelty free mass consumption that the
real problem is cities like,

1520
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:55,210
you know,
unless you have a co op where you guys

1521
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:57,130
are growing your own.
What was the second part?

1522
01:07:57,131 --> 01:07:57,930
Sorry,
I didn't,

1523
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:00,820
I didn't understand.
Not you can eat cruelty free,

1524
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:04,690
but you can't put in a mask consumption
like environment,

1525
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:06,790
like 7 million people living in
Manhattan,

1526
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,230
like good luck getting cruelty free meat
to all 7 million people cowspiracy

1527
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,260
inside that area.
You know,

1528
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,470
it's just,
you have to bring it.

1529
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:15,950
I mean,
what we've done

1530
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:21,580
over the last 150 years is moved
completely away from agriculture in,

1531
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,830
in these cities and and drive things in
and trucks.

1532
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,010
Have you ever seen some of the old
models of what they were?

1533
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,750
The way that when they were planning
cities,

1534
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:33,890
like in the early 18 hundreds when they
were designing New York and a couple

1535
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:37,550
other cities,
they had set up areas for agriculture

1536
01:08:37,551 --> 01:08:42,551
areas for livestock and they had them in
cities and so they didn't have this

1537
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:46,790
notion that we have now that everything
would be driven in and trucks because

1538
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:49,310
they didn't have trucks,
so when they had.

1539
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,290
When they had cities in the 17,
hundreds and later there,

1540
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:57,550
there was no way to get all that food to
millions and millions of people,

1541
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:59,900
so they literally had a gross stuff in
cities,

1542
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,500
which is a way better way to do it.
Michael Pollan.

1543
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:05,880
Omnivore's dilemma.
Yeah.

1544
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,740
It's great.
He's also getting into psychedelics now,

1545
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:13,520
which is pretty cool,
but just recently he's doing some really

1546
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,850
interesting who was a wonderful person
who popped him into the matrix that I

1547
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:18,050
don't know,
but I'm gonna use the matrix.

1548
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:20,060
I'm in touch with them and going to do a
podcast with him.

1549
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:20,691
Oh,
that's great.

1550
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:22,010
Figure it out.
But um,

1551
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:23,840
yeah,
I mean his whole kind of,

1552
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,700
you know,
in the Omnivore's dilemma and some of

1553
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:28,190
those other books,
like the biggest problem with our food

1554
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:33,191
supplies that we have lost our
connection to how food got there up

1555
01:09:33,231 --> 01:09:35,260
until 100,
100,

1556
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:38,420
maybe 120 at the turn of the century,
the 19th and the 20th century.

1557
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:42,650
Every body had a relationship with their
food.

1558
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,500
They knew you went to the produce
person.

1559
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:47,850
It didn't come from a shelf in a box,
you know,

1560
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:50,810
you had,
you knew where it was sourced and it was

1561
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,030
kind of.
And if you ate meat,

1562
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,140
you kind of,
you saw the bloodiness and you've just

1563
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:57,200
saw like even if you didn't kill it and
slaughtered and butchered you,

1564
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,880
you knew,
you know,

1565
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:01,550
it wasn't this prepackaged thing that
just comes from magic,

1566
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:02,780
the bacon very,
you know,

1567
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,210
and that that's our problem,
right?

1568
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,300
Food comes from the shelf.
Nobody understands.

1569
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:10,490
I think there's a giant disconnect with
and it's,

1570
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:14,300
it's so many people.
The problem is like it used to be that a

1571
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:17,540
few people were disconnected and most
people were connected and now it's

1572
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:21,080
completely turned on its head.
And when you have 20 million people in

1573
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:25,820
Los Angeles and what percentage of the
20 million people in Los Angeles acquire

1574
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:29,030
their own food from either growing
plants or hunting,

1575
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:30,390
they're like,
no one's not.

1576
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,790
Almost none.
Zero point one,

1577
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:32,360
one,
one,

1578
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,750
whatever it is.
It's kind of crazy when you consider

1579
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:39,410
that it's an essential part of being a
person is consuming food.

1580
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:42,890
But there's,
there's also this beautiful feeling that

1581
01:10:42,891 --> 01:10:47,390
you get and the vegans have this feeling
as well.

1582
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:52,420
When you grow your own food and you grow
food in a garden and you pick your salad

1583
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:56,060
and cut up your cucumbers,
like this all came from the ground right

1584
01:10:56,061 --> 01:10:58,670
out there,
but there was a really interesting

1585
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:03,920
article that was written by a Vegan that
was essentially saying there are no

1586
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:08,570
vegetarians and that the only way is
like it is actually impossible to be a

1587
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:09,350
vegetarian,
not,

1588
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:12,710
not meaning that it's impossible for you
to live and eat vegetables,

1589
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:17,930
but those vegetables need dead animals
in order to be alive and that animals

1590
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:23,610
are consumed by plants and that is what
fertilizer is all about and whether or

1591
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:25,770
not it's the fertilizer was just the
poop.

1592
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:26,910
No,
no,

1593
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,030
no.
There's a lot of it is actual decaying

1594
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,420
matter and in order to be healthy in
particular,

1595
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:34,980
like what we're doing,
most of them,

1596
01:11:34,981 --> 01:11:37,350
you know about Fritz Hobert.
Do you know what the harbor methodists

1597
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,750
don't know in,
during World War One,

1598
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:42,780
there was this,
a German scientist named Fritz harbor,

1599
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:46,260
and he came up with the harbor method of
extracting nitrogen from the air.

1600
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,990
Most people think of the air as being
oxygen,

1601
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,630
right?
The air is 78 percent,

1602
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:52,770
I think,
nitrogen,

1603
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:56,250
right.
And you can extract that nitrogen from

1604
01:11:56,251 --> 01:12:01,080
the air and use it as fertilizer.
And so because of Fritz harbor,

1605
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,580
they have been able to extract this
nitrogen and use it to fertilize plants

1606
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:10,610
because before they used like emulsified
fish and the fish was like a big one,

1607
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:15,810
like dead fish and fish bones and things
along those lines because that is when

1608
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:17,490
it decays and breaks down.

1609
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,850
That is the food for these plants.
Okay.

1610
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:25,910
So what would a Vegan,
why would the vegans opposed this in the

1611
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,900
sense that we're opposing?
They're not?

1612
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:30,750
No,
it's just,

1613
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,960
I think it's just what he wrote it.
He's the guy who wrote it was a Vegan,

1614
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:37,350
but essentially we're saying that
there's this massive cycle life and even

1615
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:39,490
pointed to Michael Pollan's work,
um,

1616
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:44,660
because Paula has written about the
emerging science of sentient plant life

1617
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:52,790
and that he believes that what's going
on with plants is very similar to what's

1618
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:58,170
going on with like maybe our
understanding of a lot of different

1619
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,970
things.
It's like as our,

1620
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,040
uh,
understanding expands,

1621
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:05,430
we have to sorta reclassify what we
think those things are.

1622
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,120
Like for the longest time they thought
that fish couldn't feel pain.

1623
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,290
Right?
And that was,

1624
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:11,101
oh,
don't worry about fish,

1625
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:12,840
can't feel pain.
And now they're saying,

1626
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:14,490
well,
we appreciate it.

1627
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,550
They can.
Yeah,

1628
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:18,120
we were,
we have a different understanding of

1629
01:13:18,121 --> 01:13:20,970
what pain is to them.
It might be a different sensation,

1630
01:13:20,971 --> 01:13:24,330
but there's very clearly some alarms
that are going off.

1631
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:28,770
It was very clearly some sort of a
reaction that seemed can be pointed out

1632
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:32,220
for plants like plants.
Not only do they have a reaction,

1633
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:35,070
but plants,
when you play the sound of caterpillars,

1634
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:38,400
chewing leaves certain plans,
like the Acacia tree,

1635
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,350
um,
has the ability,

1636
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:45,360
when it hears leaves being chewed,
it changes the taste of the leaves that

1637
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:50,361
extract some sort of a chemical and that
chemical does something to the taste of

1638
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,220
plants that makes them so an addable
that some animals have starved to death

1639
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:01,430
because upwind there were animals that
were chewing plants that sound came

1640
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:06,810
downwind through either smell or some,
some sort of a communication thing

1641
01:14:06,811 --> 01:14:09,270
that's going on with the mycelium and
with the,

1642
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,040
the,
the root structure and the plants down

1643
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,640
wind had changed their tastes and the
animals wouldn't eat them anymore and

1644
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:16,810
they were starving.
Wow.

1645
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:17,890
That's far out,
man.

1646
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:21,810
That just kinda makes me think like,
what's gonna be the next sort of like

1647
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:25,510
Vegan movement.
Maybe some kind of IOWASCA ceremony in

1648
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:30,420
the middle of like a of a garden or like
an agricultural thing where we're just,

1649
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,010
we're listening for and trying to make,
you know,

1650
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:38,830
we have to make peace with that.
Everything needs everything else in

1651
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:40,410
order to make it well.
It's,

1652
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:44,590
I think it's a like a suffering and a
respect thing,

1653
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:45,310
right?
Yeah.

1654
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:49,690
And then then you also have to consider
if plants are sentient life forms,

1655
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,990
how fucked up is it to have these
gigantic large scale agricultural setups

1656
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:59,020
where you are,
you are completely unnaturally changing

1657
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:03,940
the landscape in order to grow corn or
in order to grow lettuce or strawberry.

1658
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:05,980
It's like that is not normal.

1659
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,730
Like it's not normal to have 7,000 acres
of corn.

1660
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,000
Right?
Like in just corn all in a neat row that

1661
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:16,060
you could see from space and it's.
And it's destroying the soil to.

1662
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:16,880
Yeah,
completely.

1663
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,680
It's completely destroying the soil.
But like with this idea of like having,

1664
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:25,770
you said respect and in pain,
kind of getting into that idea like do

1665
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,910
you think um,
and I'm,

1666
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,910
my opinion is results may vary and I'm
not so sure.

1667
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,940
But if everybody had the data and saw
the data about factory farming for

1668
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:39,700
instance,
that they would change in us,

1669
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:42,520
act accordingly and not eat that shit
anymore.

1670
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:44,850
Definitely not everybody.
Some people don't give a final.

1671
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,680
I think some people's doing fuck and
those Gordon Gekko type dudes,

1672
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:49,480
the slicked back hair that I'm like,
fuck it,

1673
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:51,490
I'm here to win Gimme that burden.
Trump,

1674
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:51,911
trump,
trump,

1675
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:52,420
trump,
trump.

1676
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,710
I mean,
I've thought about myself.

1677
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:55,450
I mean,
I've seen every one of those movies.

1678
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:56,830
I've read every book,
you know,

1679
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,760
I didn't work.
I'll have a muffin from time to time and

1680
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:02,140
I'm like,
what is wrong with me?

1681
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:05,980
Like is there something,
am I associate to do that?

1682
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,990
Because it's easy to do.
If somebody said,

1683
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:08,853
Oh,
you're hungry,

1684
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:12,880
why don't you shoot that pig in the head
and a cut off a leg and throw it on the

1685
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:14,980
smoker?
Well then you would have a real issue.

1686
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:16,060
It'd be like,
I don't want to do that.

1687
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,860
Okay,
well why don't you pull those beets out

1688
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:18,970
of the ground?
Well,

1689
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:22,180
if you put on these headphones,
you can hear the beat scream or their

1690
01:16:22,181 --> 01:16:22,811
parents.
I'm like,

1691
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:23,940
AH,
fuck off.

1692
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,530
I mean,
I don't know,

1693
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:28,630
but I don't know.
I don't think anybody knows,

1694
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:32,050
but if there's just something about
plausible deniability that's kind of

1695
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:34,150
hardwired into us in all aspects of her
life.

1696
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:37,840
Not just food,
but war and politics and money and greed

1697
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:41,020
and oil and everything.
That's what it takes to get oil to this

1698
01:16:41,021 --> 01:16:43,730
damn country and everything that goes on
to fill up our car.

1699
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,690
You know what I mean?
A plausible deniability is definitely

1700
01:16:46,691 --> 01:16:50,230
the way to look at it.
The extreme ability to detach ourselves

1701
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,660
from the consequences of our actions,
you know,

1702
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,720
because it's convenient in the moment.
That's right.

1703
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,190
Yeah.
And convenient in the moment to just buy

1704
01:16:57,191 --> 01:17:00,160
that quarter pounder with cheese.
Not Think about it that it's a ground

1705
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:04,620
animal burger.
That's right.

1706
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,790
Know,
and you know,

1707
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:08,680
it's only going to cost me two bucks.
Yeah.

1708
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:09,980
And you get away from that,

1709
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,240
which is kind of crazy.
I mean,

1710
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:15,770
it really is amazing.
If it wasn't connected to such horrific

1711
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:18,290
crimes against nature,
it's amazing.

1712
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:20,140
What's amazing that you can just go.
So I mean,

1713
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:23,810
what an incredible system they've
developed outside of food.

1714
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:27,590
Just what you know,
the economic factors for how convenience

1715
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,360
equals pleasure equals like an economic
value that is usually low.

1716
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:36,260
How that has all sort of work together
to kind of create this system that we're

1717
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:41,150
living in now and we have this again,
this plausible deniability kind of

1718
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:45,050
hardwired thing to ignore it.
Know Walmart is a great example.

1719
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:45,690
I mean,
you know,

1720
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:48,830
the sort of this disenfranchised middle
of the country,

1721
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,630
you know,
and they did lose their jobs in that

1722
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,120
area of the,
of the country's decimated,

1723
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,060
but they all shop at Walmart and that's
the,

1724
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:59,180
that's,
that's part of what the heart of what

1725
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:00,014
the problem is.

1726
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,820
It's cheap,
it's convenient.

1727
01:18:01,821 --> 01:18:03,350
You're still going.
And it's like,

1728
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:05,240
well,
what's it going to be?

1729
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,130
You know,
pick a horse that's been interesting is

1730
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:08,720
that this is all really recent,
right?

1731
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:13,280
I mean this is all from the industrial
revolution on this is all this last

1732
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:18,170
couple of hundred years of civilization
where we've sort of entered into this

1733
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:21,880
wage existence.
You know,

1734
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:26,890
where people are living this way and
buying this horrible fucking factory

1735
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:31,050
produced food.
And even more recent that,

1736
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:31,611
I mean,
yes,

1737
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:34,760
it's all can be traced back to the post
industrial revolution stuff,

1738
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:38,090
but even just like the massive high
perkins can consumerism,

1739
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,900
that's only really taken off since the
mid nineties.

1740
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:44,810
Yeah.
There's a cool little movie out called

1741
01:18:44,811 --> 01:18:46,340
uh,
the minimalists.

1742
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,320
I mean,
after awhile it kind of,

1743
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:48,850
uh,
you know,

1744
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,630
I got it and I didn't finish the whole
thing.

1745
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:52,160
But the first hour is fascinating.

1746
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:55,370
It's about these guys that wrote a book
called the minimalists and about,

1747
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,300
um,
you know,

1748
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:59,600
there were all kinds of corporate ladder
kind of American successful guys and

1749
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:00,670
just consuming,
consuming,

1750
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:01,690
buying shit,
buying Shin,

1751
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,080
buying shit.
Then all of a sudden they just kind of

1752
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:05,270
had the kind of big,
kind of cliched awakening.

1753
01:19:05,271 --> 01:19:05,811
Like,
oh my God,

1754
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:10,100
maybe I don't need all this shit.
But the data that they present from

1755
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:15,290
what's happened in the mid nineties on
sort of as a result of the internet boom

1756
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:19,280
with instant gratification,
one click shopping and disassociation of

1757
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:23,720
just the accumulation of stuff.
And we live in,

1758
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:24,470
um,
you know,

1759
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:26,840
we live in bigger houses now than we've
ever lived.

1760
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,070
Square footage wise,
they've never been so big before and

1761
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,880
yet,
um,

1762
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,490
you know,
they've put all these heat maps on a,

1763
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,730
they did the study where they put heat
maps on these homes to see where people

1764
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:42,170
were living in the homes hanging out and
like the average family and like they're

1765
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:46,130
huge kind of mansion or something.
Only uses like 40 percent of the house.

1766
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,240
Yeah,
it makes sense.

1767
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:50,690
And also has a self storage unit to go
with it somewhere else,

1768
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,450
you know,
it's just this endless kind of

1769
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:56,540
relationship we have with it.
So I watched hoarders the other night

1770
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:01,070
and there were some digital hardcore
bought two houses next to his house

1771
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:05,480
because he had so much shit like that.
He had to move the shit to other houses.

1772
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,300
It was fucking crazy.
Orders

1773
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:10,890
is gnarly.
But this is a weird hoarder because it

1774
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:13,920
was a guy who had some money.
He bought two ounces.

1775
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:15,690
Yeah.
It wasn't like a hoarder,

1776
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:19,560
like some poor person that was going to
yard sales and buying used clothes.

1777
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:22,590
And then putting them in bags and their
house and stack them up the ceiling with

1778
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:24,930
newspapers and stuff.
This was a guy who had all these

1779
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:28,050
collectibles and uh,
he was a neurosurgeon,

1780
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,570
which is really,
really interesting.

1781
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,760
Interesting.
Yeah.

1782
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,380
He lives in Vegas and he wanted to be
known for his collection.

1783
01:20:34,381 --> 01:20:36,360
He had crazy stuff like he had,
um,

1784
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,690
there within two.
He has a lot of space memorabilia.

1785
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,630
Like he had a,
uh,

1786
01:20:41,631 --> 01:20:46,631
a scale model of one of the challengers
or one of the space shuttles rather.

1787
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:48,000
He had,
um,

1788
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:53,090
one of the test lunar modules that a
buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

1789
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:59,421
apparently had used in testing and in
preparation for the Apollo missions and

1790
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,970
hit a bunch of crazy shit all over his
house.

1791
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:07,800
But he had three houses fill this stuff.
The courtyards and all around his pool

1792
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:09,870
was stacked up with shit.
Man,

1793
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,180
that's so insane.
It's just

1794
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:18,000
escapism.
This need to sort of like pacify our

1795
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:19,310
existence here.
I just,

1796
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,020
you know,
as we kind of evolve and kind of grow

1797
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:24,540
into the future,
it just seems like so few people can

1798
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:28,230
truly be comfortable in their own skin.
And just be,

1799
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:31,530
be present and be comfortable and
content contentness.

1800
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,800
We're constantly inventing new ways to
escape,

1801
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,620
to disassociate,
to get out of the moment.

1802
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:41,040
What do you think that is?
What do you think is so compelling to us

1803
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:46,041
about the constant accumulation of
material possessions and Ms Dot hold.

1804
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:50,100
Greed is good sort of mentality and
moving up the corporate ladder without

1805
01:21:50,101 --> 01:21:53,880
any sort of appreciation or acceptance
and the fact that we're these finite

1806
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:58,350
lifeforms clinging to a spinning orb,
hurling through infinity,

1807
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,650
all those inevitable and inescapable
realities.

1808
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:02,780
I mean,
we're,

1809
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,920
we,
we look at them every day we look up.

1810
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,560
I mean,
that is undeniable that you are looking

1811
01:22:07,561 --> 01:22:10,230
up as you leave your house and get to
your car.

1812
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:14,100
You have infinity above your head and
you don't look at it.

1813
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:14,541
I mean,
what,

1814
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:15,420
what's going on with us?

1815
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,440
I think,
um,

1816
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,860
your were born.
The thing that we've kind of created

1817
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:27,861
this construct that we call society.
We're automatically born into a bad hand

1818
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,700
and I think it's,
it's completely bogus.

1819
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:36,420
You're dealt a bad hand at birth.
It doesn't even matter if you're born

1820
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:37,320
into privilege.
I mean,

1821
01:22:37,321 --> 01:22:38,071
sure,
that's great.

1822
01:22:38,071 --> 01:22:41,100
If you're born into privilege versus the
slums of Mumbai does.

1823
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:41,934
Definitely better.
Yeah,

1824
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:42,960
that's definitely better.
I mean,

1825
01:22:42,961 --> 01:22:45,360
of course I'm not going to be falling in
Beverly Hills.

1826
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:48,050
It's way better than Liberia.
Yeah,

1827
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:50,580
I mean Syria,
Bentley convertible.

1828
01:22:50,581 --> 01:22:53,400
Did you do in way better than someone in
Zaire with no feet?

1829
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,860
No.
No question,

1830
01:22:55,861 --> 01:22:57,040
but like,
you know,

1831
01:22:57,050 --> 01:23:00,160
you're dealt a bad hand of like,
you know,

1832
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,170
being alive as hard,
right?

1833
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,120
You know,
you're,

1834
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,200
you're,
you're born,

1835
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,250
you're going to go into this building

1836
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,240
from ages.
What?

1837
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,880
When you go to school,
it just for is that about right?

1838
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:13,060
Some people go to preschool at for
kindergarten is five,

1839
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,430
first grade six,
four to 18.

1840
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:18,760
You're going to go into this big cement
building to be taught these certain

1841
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:21,440
subjects in this certain order and then
you're going to leave that cement

1842
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,260
building,
go into another one that's even more

1843
01:23:23,261 --> 01:23:26,800
expensive and then you're going to leave
that and you're going to get some kind

1844
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:30,640
of employment thing,
which exists pretty much from nine to

1845
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:32,920
five for most people,
unless you're fortunate,

1846
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:36,490
are clever enough to kind of exist
outside of that framework and create

1847
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:38,890
your own reality.
But most people are going to work some

1848
01:23:38,891 --> 01:23:43,300
kind of structured life and I just,
I think it's hard.

1849
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:47,980
I think it's just hard to be alive.
It definitely is.

1850
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,080
Well,
it's not harder than it's ever been.

1851
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,730
It's easier than it's ever been.
Right.

1852
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:55,590
I mean,
it's more safe than it's ever been seen.

1853
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,540
Much more access to information than
ever before.

1854
01:23:59,170 --> 01:23:59,981
Yes.
But,

1855
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:01,960
you know,
I think it is in some aspects it's

1856
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:03,220
harder because,
um,

1857
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:04,500
well I,
yeah,

1858
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:07,840
I don't know if that's true because back
in the olden times you did have to,

1859
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:08,800
uh,
you know,

1860
01:24:08,801 --> 01:24:10,750
kind of compete against each other for
survival.

1861
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:15,751
But I think it could be argued that it's
harder because this constant sort of,

1862
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,510
you know,
onslaught of media and comparing

1863
01:24:19,511 --> 01:24:21,790
ourselves to each other and to feel
insecure.

1864
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:24,070
If you don't look like that,
if you don't look like this,

1865
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:26,530
if you don't have that,
something's wrong with you.

1866
01:24:26,531 --> 01:24:29,770
If you can't afford to buy that,
you're not doing well.

1867
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:32,530
We're fucking up man.
If you can't afford to buy that or if

1868
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:34,720
you don't look like that,
oh my God,

1869
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:36,850
I'm sorry.
Nobody's ever going to want to fuck you.

1870
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:39,010
That's really sad.
I don't want to fuck you if you don't

1871
01:24:39,011 --> 01:24:42,310
have the stuff that's awful instead of
all the stuff you've got to have all the

1872
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:44,920
stuff.
And it's a terrible thing to say to

1873
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:46,210
teach our children,
you know?

1874
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:48,010
Well.
So I think it's hard to be alive.

1875
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:50,410
It isn't a sense.
It's very tricky.

1876
01:24:50,411 --> 01:24:53,170
And it's also,
I think we are being raised by babies.

1877
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,500
I really do think that,
well I have children and I kinda,

1878
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,450
I kinda get it now in a sense that
before I had children,

1879
01:25:03,451 --> 01:25:05,860
I used to think of people as being sort
of static.

1880
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:09,610
Obviously I was younger and when you're,
especially when you're real young,

1881
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:11,200
when you're like 20 or something like
that,

1882
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:15,430
you don't really take into consideration
that the people around you used to be

1883
01:25:15,431 --> 01:25:17,680
your age.
You kind of know it in an abstract sort

1884
01:25:17,681 --> 01:25:21,010
of a sense,
but once you actually have a baby and

1885
01:25:21,011 --> 01:25:23,890
then like five years later the baby's
talking to you and you're having

1886
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,880
conversations,
you're like,

1887
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:26,290
oh,
you're fucking learning shit now,

1888
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:28,600
and then 10 years later they babies in
high school and you're like,

1889
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:30,010
oh Jesus Christ,
you're almost a man.

1890
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,950
And then you realize that,
oh,

1891
01:25:32,951 --> 01:25:37,951
we're all babies who had babies and you
raise those babies and then they become

1892
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:39,820
adults and have babies of their own,
but no,

1893
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:41,980
there are no grownups.
It's bullshit.

1894
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:45,940
It doesn't exist.
Like when you're a kid and you're sad,

1895
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:46,480
you go,
oh,

1896
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,940
one day I'm going to be a grownup and
all this is gonna make sense?

1897
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,730
But it never does.
That day never comes you.

1898
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,490
You get older,
but you're a baby still.

1899
01:25:54,491 --> 01:25:58,420
You're just an old baby.
You're an old baby with a car and

1900
01:25:58,421 --> 01:26:02,740
fucking credit card debt and you have a
baby and then that baby grows up.

1901
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,040
Well,
I'm smarter than my dad.

1902
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:05,600
He's a fucking idiot.
And it's like,

1903
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:07,310
you know that dad.
My Dad didn't know shit.

1904
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:08,270
He didn't even have the Internet.

1905
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,200
It's so funny and you know,
I think that's a.

1906
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:14,680
and I'm not the first to say it,
but that's such a huge thing with trump.

1907
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:17,280
And he acts like a seven year old.
Yeah.

1908
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,900
It's like,
what is a seven year old dude?

1909
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:20,460
Like you get your Mug,
Rogan,

1910
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,630
you know,
fucking everything

1911
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,340
that so truly puts his fucking name on
everybody's probably got it on his socks

1912
01:26:30,341 --> 01:26:32,830
and his underwear on the band.
It probably says trump.

1913
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,920
Trump underwear.
You were staying at a trump hotel?

1914
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:37,010
Yes.
Yeah,

1915
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,320
I know it did in New York.
And you know,

1916
01:26:38,321 --> 01:26:38,980
the,
um,

1917
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:40,240
the,
the toilet paper,

1918
01:26:40,241 --> 01:26:42,120
I'm like the little sticker they put on
it,

1919
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:46,750
that's an trump insignia on the toilet.
But it is called the trump hotel.

1920
01:26:46,751 --> 01:26:47,890
I mean,
if you go to the renaissance,

1921
01:26:47,891 --> 01:26:50,920
it says renaissance.
But it's much,

1922
01:26:50,921 --> 01:26:52,450
much more ironic though with the trump
thing.

1923
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:56,740
It's weird because it's a guy's name
who's alive and now happens to be

1924
01:26:56,741 --> 01:27:00,970
president and he says it's about,
it's a symbol of quality around the

1925
01:27:00,971 --> 01:27:03,730
world or whatever the you see that trump
card.

1926
01:27:03,731 --> 01:27:05,800
But I think it's bullshit.
I think he's just a seven year old who

1927
01:27:05,801 --> 01:27:07,450
likes to write his name on my list.
Shit.

1928
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:11,450
Well the evidence in his tweets to
people you know,

1929
01:27:11,451 --> 01:27:13,840
and then he gets mad and tweets about
shit.

1930
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:16,540
He responds to people and argues with
people.

1931
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:17,530
Meet you.
Tweet at him.

1932
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:19,210
No,
no.

1933
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,970
I tweeted.
I hardly tweeted anybody.

1934
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,833
You don't get it?

1935
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:23,450
Yeah,
I don't.

1936
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:26,890
I don't want to.
I definitely don't get into like those

1937
01:27:26,891 --> 01:27:31,510
kind of tweet battles over the Internet.
But I just think as I've gotten older

1938
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:35,380
and had some good experiences and bad
experiences online,

1939
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:39,790
I've realized that you can,
like you were talking about like you go

1940
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:43,870
out and you seek bad things.
If you have this in your mind that

1941
01:27:43,871 --> 01:27:45,970
you're going to go out and you're going
to be attacked.

1942
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,060
So I'm going to wear a gun.
I'm going to have a knife,

1943
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,900
I'm going to wear a bulletproof vest and
all these different things.

1944
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:55,090
Yup.
You can also seek negative interaction

1945
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,970
online.
You can go look for it when you find it,

1946
01:27:57,971 --> 01:28:01,480
you could react to it and that begets
more of it and I think that you're far

1947
01:28:01,481 --> 01:28:06,340
better off just choosing the people that
you interact with an actual real life.

1948
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:10,090
And then when I look at things online,
I'm just observing.

1949
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:12,190
I very rarely interact.
If I do,

1950
01:28:12,191 --> 01:28:16,720
it's a very friendly and I limit myself
almost entirely to friendly

1951
01:28:16,721 --> 01:28:17,730
interactions.
Cool.

1952
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:20,170
And anything that's negative,
I just stay away.

1953
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:22,240
It's not worth it.
There's nothing to be gained.

1954
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:24,880
If you,
if you get an insult war with somebody

1955
01:28:24,881 --> 01:28:26,560
and you make them feel bad,
like do you.

1956
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:29,560
What do you get out of that?
Unless it's funny when you get out of

1957
01:28:29,561 --> 01:28:31,030
that,
unless it's tongue and cheek and

1958
01:28:31,031 --> 01:28:31,864
everybody's having a good day.

1959
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,390
Yeah.
Well and and also you know what you can

1960
01:28:35,391 --> 01:28:37,760
do in a hundred and 40 characters is
absolutely ridiculous.

1961
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,430
It's insane.
You can't get into a meaningful

1962
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,330
thoughtful debate and 140 characters,
but people seek it out.

1963
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,330
They seek these debates out and they ask
you like what they think are hard

1964
01:28:47,331 --> 01:28:49,220
hitting questions marked.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1965
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,150
Get involved in this 140 character
thing.

1966
01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:55,760
It's like,
it's not just the reason why I asked

1967
01:28:55,761 --> 01:28:56,420
because I'm,
uh,

1968
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,980
you know,
Dunkin starting to kind of tweet it,

1969
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:59,470
tweet at trump a little bit and
interest.

1970
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,380
Does he,
what does he say?

1971
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:03,610
Just kind of wacky shit like tweets.
Adam,

1972
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:06,330
I'm going to be the minister of,
you know,

1973
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:08,390
whatever you got.
And then we got.

1974
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,440
We got to find some of them are there.
They're kind of funny,

1975
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,710
but because I think trump sometimes he
does read.

1976
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:17,050
It's reading.
Sweet sort of reads his tweets.

1977
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:18,970
He gets in there.
I guarantee you,

1978
01:29:18,971 --> 01:29:21,330
we get to know.
You ever see the debate that he had back

1979
01:29:21,331 --> 01:29:23,240
and forth with John Stewart?
Oh yeah,

1980
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,530
of course.
I mean that's fucking hilarious.

1981
01:29:25,531 --> 01:29:27,450
And Jon Stewart has put it into his act
now.

1982
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:34,200
He tweets them at 1:30 in the morning.
Little Jon Stewart is a pussy and it

1983
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:38,370
would be hopeless in a debate with me.
Imagine that because actually did that.

1984
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:39,900
This is the guy that's the president
now,

1985
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:40,770
so,
so great.

1986
01:29:40,771 --> 01:29:42,270
But yeah,
but I mean it says so much about the

1987
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:43,800
personality of someone and I'm,
I,

1988
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:46,560
I don't get in twitter wars because I
don't really tweet all that much.

1989
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:48,750
But get facebook.
Do you use facebook?

1990
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:51,720
I do and I'm just a horribly impulsive
about it.

1991
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:54,660
Horribly impulsive to a fault.
Like what kind of stuff do you get in?

1992
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,090
You were saying you have issues with
vegans.

1993
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:58,530
Is that when you get into it?
Yeah,

1994
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:00,190
I mean there's,
there's some vegan stuff,

1995
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,460
a lot of politics stuff and you know,
the election cycle and,

1996
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:04,323
and I'm,
I'm,

1997
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,600
you know,
a little quick on the trigger to like,

1998
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:10,440
because you know with online,
in social media it's just push a button

1999
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,190
and like,
you know,

2000
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:15,660
calling people more on just far too
quickly for taking a breath,

2001
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:17,760
stepping back and go,
maybe I shouldn't call you a moron.

2002
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,890
That's probably not the best debate
tactic,

2003
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,420
you know,
benefit it,

2004
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:25,110
that benefit if you make them feel bad
that there are more on and you get your

2005
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:26,880
rocks off in some way.
And I've done it.

2006
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,250
I absolutely have done in the past,
but I don't,

2007
01:30:29,251 --> 01:30:32,880
I try very hard not to engage in that
kind of thinking anymore because I don't

2008
01:30:32,881 --> 01:30:35,340
think all it does not going to like it.
Also,

2009
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:40,370
when you get into conflicts with people,
negative conflicts create these uh,

2010
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:44,700
centers of attention and those conflicts
become these centers of attention and

2011
01:30:44,701 --> 01:30:49,080
ultimately nothing happens in them.
They just sort of distract you.

2012
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:54,290
A little vortex of bullshit.
And I think and as I've gotten older and

2013
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:59,760
started analyzing my own life and
happiness and productivity and when I'm

2014
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:03,510
at my most creative is when I'm not
engaging in any of that,

2015
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,070
like the least.

2016
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:09,990
I am involved in the negativity and
conflicts and debates and going back and

2017
01:31:09,991 --> 01:31:12,690
forth and trying to make people feel bad
and all that stupid shit that people

2018
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:15,150
getting wrapped up in you fucking idiot.
You know,

2019
01:31:15,151 --> 01:31:17,670
all that kind of stupid stuff.
But more the least.

2020
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:22,560
I do that the more it frees up my
resources and it frees up my mind and I

2021
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:25,350
don't have this,
like I think anytime you get in conflict

2022
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:29,400
a content conflict with someone,
it creates like this negative center,

2023
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:34,401
this like there's this vortex.
It's like weird area in your mind,

2024
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,800
in your consciousness where that
conflict exists.

2025
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:41,880
It's on a shelf just stinking up the
joint and I think the least amount of

2026
01:31:41,881 --> 01:31:44,670
those that you have in your
consciousness and your library of,

2027
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,950
of memories,
the better off you are.

2028
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:48,750
Yeah,
I tend to.

2029
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:51,330
I tend to agree with that and I tend to
feel that like,

2030
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:55,340
you know,
especially if it's for somebody of my

2031
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:59,160
cloth,
it's hyper hypocritical to attack

2032
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,310
online,

2033
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,500
you know,
over their political beliefs for sure.

2034
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,191
Um,
you know,

2035
01:32:03,191 --> 01:32:08,110
being a spiritual person,
but I'm not at the same time like

2036
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:12,280
especially now within the last year,
this is a highly charged debate cycle

2037
01:32:12,281 --> 01:32:15,520
and I was convinced that,
you know,

2038
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:17,650
how,
how possible,

2039
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:22,680
how could a cognitive Lee kind of adept
human being justify voting for Donald

2040
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:24,701
Trump?
Like,

2041
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:29,110
it just didn't make sense to me,
but it happened one volv justify voting

2042
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:30,610
for hillary either.
Oh,

2043
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:31,900
I can make that.
Kenya.

2044
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,040
Absolutely don't you think that there's
a lot of issues involved with Hillary

2045
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:36,873
Clinton?
First of all,

2046
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:41,890
Hillary said in the wikileaks documents
that she was against marijuana

2047
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:45,940
legalization,
legalization in every sense of the word.

2048
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,480
I,
I'm,

2049
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,100
I'm not,
you know,

2050
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:49,900
Pro Hillary Foundation.
I mean,

2051
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:51,490
there's a lot of things you could bring
up.

2052
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,970
I'm not a Clinton flag waving kind of
guy,

2053
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,050
but you know,
comparing the two,

2054
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:00,700
you know,
and,

2055
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,740
and like however you look like.

2056
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:05,080
So to me Hillary Clinton was just status
quo,

2057
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:08,290
right?
But it isn't the status quo fucked up

2058
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,440
and yet really the status quo is better
than negative,

2059
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,900
right?
This is going to be negative progress.

2060
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:16,660
And how negative,
how certain are you that it's going to

2061
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:18,700
be negative progress?
Absolutely certain.

2062
01:33:18,701 --> 01:33:21,280
I mean the Supreme Court alone,
I mean,

2063
01:33:21,281 --> 01:33:24,220
you know,
Ginsburg made the fatal flaw of not

2064
01:33:24,221 --> 01:33:27,880
retiring sooner.
So I mean she's 180 years old.

2065
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:32,140
So there's already,
there's already one vacancy there.

2066
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:34,050
Environments,
man,

2067
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:36,490
she's not gonna make it.
And you know,

2068
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:41,070
so trump in one term could presumably
have three appointees.

2069
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,900
Right?
And that is negative progress,

2070
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:45,650
but you know,
that he was a Democrat for almost.

2071
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,650
No,
but he's not now man.

2072
01:33:47,651 --> 01:33:48,281
I mean,
look,

2073
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:53,140
Steve Bannon and the CEO of Exxon,
the CEO of Carl's Jr.

2074
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:58,141
I'm a ben carson and being the hud guy.
But I mean it's,

2075
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:01,180
it's just,
it's absolute insanity.

2076
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:03,600
Why didn't he make Ben Carson,
carson,

2077
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:05,650
the attorney general,
or rather the,

2078
01:34:05,651 --> 01:34:07,360
uh,
surgeon general surgeon general.

2079
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:08,830
I mean,
why wouldn't he have been involved in

2080
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:09,700
something medical?
I mean,

2081
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:12,370
he's very talented.
Neurospheres jesse was tHe african

2082
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:14,560
american guy who grew up in the projects
man.

2083
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:16,550
So he should run hud.
Oh,

2084
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,920
how odd.
That was the argument.

2085
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,330
Oh,
okay.

2086
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:20,380
Yeah,
that was,

2087
01:34:20,381 --> 01:34:22,240
it seems like he knows more aBout
medIcine,

2088
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:27,241
right.
As a doctor take you to fucking medical

2089
01:34:27,581 --> 01:34:29,740
expert.
And he's actually good at that.

2090
01:34:29,741 --> 01:34:31,270
Yeah,
he's fucking amazing at it.

2091
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,370
I mean,
he's like one of the top neurosurgeons

2092
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:34,220
in the world.
Right.

2093
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:37,390
So he grew up from the projects.
African american guy grew up out of

2094
01:34:37,391 --> 01:34:38,920
there.
So he must know about the housing and

2095
01:34:38,921 --> 01:34:42,610
urban development.
So it's just complete insanity to me.

2096
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:46,540
Ended is taking two,
three steps backwards,

2097
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:50,530
the only silver lining that you can
weave from it and it is,

2098
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:53,800
you know,
it's a good thing to weave is that there

2099
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,160
is kind of a collective,
a consolidation

2100
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,810
of solidarity,
kind of like,

2101
01:34:59,811 --> 01:35:00,400
hey,
you know,

2102
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,210
we need to rise up,
get our shit together,

2103
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:06,260
figure out how to articulate the
opposite vision and perhaps defeat this

2104
01:35:06,261 --> 01:35:08,210
later on down the line.
And that's cool.

2105
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:11,000
People are waking up and there's great
conversations happening.

2106
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:14,390
Well I think there's an ebb and flow
that always exists in cultures.

2107
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:16,130
You know,
there's a push left and a push,

2108
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:18,380
right?
And we try this for eight years and then

2109
01:35:18,381 --> 01:35:21,470
we'd go that way for eight years and
some of it's productive and some of it's

2110
01:35:21,471 --> 01:35:24,110
very negative,
but even the negative,

2111
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,870
ultimately it,
it,

2112
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:30,380
it fosters resistance and that
resistance is often times positive.

2113
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:34,250
And in even in resistance,
there's a lot of understanding of the

2114
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:38,170
consequences of negativity that may be
wasn't really appreciate it.

2115
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:42,290
And while you had like a progressive
democrat in office,

2116
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:43,371
but then there's,
you know,

2117
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:47,060
there's things that obama did that
people are incredibly upset with in

2118
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:49,280
terms of whistle blowing,
you know,

2119
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:53,930
like whistleblowers were supposed to be
cherished and he was going to help him.

2120
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:56,750
That was all part of the hope and change
website when he was running for

2121
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:59,360
president as was.
And then of course he's been one of the

2122
01:35:59,361 --> 01:36:03,950
worst people in terms of freedom of
press in terms of whistleblowers been in

2123
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:07,460
one of the worst administrations ever.
Guantanamo never closed drones.

2124
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,110
Yeah.
Drones and drone wars.

2125
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,480
Yeah.
All this stuff because there's

2126
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:12,390
absolutely no,
there's some,

2127
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:14,020
there's no doubt about it.
Um,

2128
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,800
but you know,
with sort of,

2129
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:18,320
you know,
the ebbs and flows of progress versus no

2130
01:36:18,321 --> 01:36:19,280
progress,
you know.

2131
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,830
And in this instance,
in this context,

2132
01:36:21,831 --> 01:36:25,490
it's just how many people are going to
get hurt as a result of it.

2133
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:28,880
That's like,
that's what I don't mind.

2134
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:32,180
That's why it's not the lack of
perspective that I think we have

2135
01:36:32,181 --> 01:36:34,220
collectively as a culture.
The lack of.

2136
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:38,150
I mean what you were talking about about
these people living their lives solely

2137
01:36:38,151 --> 01:36:43,151
intent on acquiring material possessions
and status and all the nonsense that

2138
01:36:44,121 --> 01:36:44,954
goes with it.

2139
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:50,380
How much of that can be attributed to
the relative lack of exposure to

2140
01:36:51,111 --> 01:36:54,590
psychedelics collectively that we have.
If you looked at,

2141
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:58,970
if you looked at the entire 300 million,
but you knoW how they do that red map

2142
01:36:58,971 --> 01:37:01,070
and you see how many people are
republicans and how many people are

2143
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:03,890
democrats and it looks like a.
It looks like the whole country,

2144
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:07,520
one of the avatar people get hit by a
train and that's what it looks like.

2145
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:09,080
Right?
I got splattered.

2146
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:12,140
But when you.
When you look at that,

2147
01:37:12,141 --> 01:37:16,640
if you had a similar map in terms of
like how many people have had what I

2148
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:19,070
would consider a Breakthrough
psychedelic experienCe.

2149
01:37:19,071 --> 01:37:21,620
I know some people that have done
mushrooms and they did a little bit and

2150
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:26,621
they felt good and no big deal and I.
I had done quite a few things before my

2151
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:31,460
first real dmt trip and the first real
real dmt trip was like,

2152
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:34,430
okay,
everything else is bullshit.

2153
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,330
Like,
this is awesome,

2154
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:39,950
this is so awesome,
and so mind blowing and just knowing

2155
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:43,490
that that's a real plaCe that anyone can
get to.

2156
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:45,500
relatively easy.
Not only that,

2157
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:49,430
this is not a precious material.
this is a material that exists in

2158
01:37:49,431 --> 01:37:51,620
thousands of different plants all over
you.

2159
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,920
Everywhere you go.
Like every drive down the street,

2160
01:37:54,921 --> 01:37:58,120
you'll a fucking hundred different kinds
of plants that have dnt in around.

2161
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:03,560
So the dmt experience to me was a.
I would say like I was really like two

2162
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:09,060
different people on the pre dmt person
in the post emt person.

2163
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:10,710
I'm like,
I mean a real similar.

2164
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:14,520
I talked to the same but the,
the person,

2165
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:18,660
the experiences,
they're so vastly different that I was

2166
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:23,661
exposed to a whole new infinity area of
the spectrum that I didn't know existed

2167
01:38:25,471 --> 01:38:28,530
before.
I assisted in this very small area.

2168
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:33,200
I thought there was like birth and death
and love and sex and beer and you know,

2169
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,730
fucking movies and what all the other
things he enjoyed.

2170
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:37,380
Right.
I didn't even know that was real.

2171
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,750
How many people out there like that?
I mean,

2172
01:38:39,751 --> 01:38:41,700
is there a,
a million of us,

2173
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:42,930
I mean,
is there even,

2174
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,300
is there even 2 million?
I mean,

2175
01:38:45,301 --> 01:38:48,990
how many people out of the 300 and
whatever million people in this country

2176
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:51,110
have had breakthrough psychedelic
experiences?

2177
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:53,430
How many people did they say did lsd in
the sixties?

2178
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:55,800
It's a good question.
That changed the culture.

2179
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:58,320
I don't know what the number is,
but I mean,

2180
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:01,130
you had your dad's on around.
I probably tell us.

2181
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,360
Yeah,
it was probably responsible for 40 or 50

2182
01:39:03,361 --> 01:39:04,141
percent of it.
Right?

2183
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:05,520
What was the number?
It was.

2184
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:06,510
Yeah.
And this is,

2185
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,640
to me,
this is a fascinating case study for us

2186
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:10,800
to look at is,
you know,

2187
01:39:10,801 --> 01:39:12,510
in the sixties,
you know,

2188
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:16,020
millions and millions and millions of
people did some kind of psychedelic,

2189
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:16,650
right?
Yeah.

2190
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,200
And if they didn't do a second alec,
at least they,

2191
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:21,630
you know,
smoked grass and put on sergeant peppers

2192
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,020
at the very least.
And yay,

2193
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:26,730
great thIngs were born out of that.
I mean,

2194
01:39:26,731 --> 01:39:30,540
an argument could be made that if the
sixties didn't happen and flourish and

2195
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:33,820
become what it became that you and I
wouldn't be some here right now and

2196
01:39:33,821 --> 01:39:36,420
being able to talk about what we're
talking about.

2197
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:38,330
I think that's a very good argument.
I think.

2198
01:39:38,331 --> 01:39:39,164
Yeah,
right.

2199
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:42,960
but here we are 2016 and Donald Trump is
elected president.

2200
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:47,961
So last time we had a global kind of
consciousness shift that was massive and

2201
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:51,240
really shook us all up,
you know,

2202
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:52,710
I don't know,
not enough happened.

2203
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:55,320
So it's like,
what's it going to take next time?

2204
01:39:55,321 --> 01:39:56,550
Okay.
So let's,

2205
01:39:56,580 --> 01:40:00,060
let's get,
let's just say let's get 10 percent of

2206
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:02,430
the country to turn on.
And for me I kind of,

2207
01:40:02,431 --> 01:40:06,090
I'm a little bit more elastic with it
and I think that can also be,

2208
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:07,410
you know,
meditation.

2209
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,391
Sure.
Or,

2210
01:40:08,391 --> 01:40:11,210
or flickr,
flotation tanks.

2211
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:14,160
Not so holotropic breathing,
whatever.

2212
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,620
The method isn't as important to me
anymore,

2213
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:20,250
but like say get 10 to 20 percent of the
people to do that.

2214
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:21,001
Six,
three,

2215
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:22,470
6 million people,
whatever it is,

2216
01:40:22,471 --> 01:40:24,450
you know,
then you know,

2217
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:25,920
what,
what is it going to change?

2218
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,250
How are we going to integrate,
and we'd,

2219
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:28,830
we're talking about this a couple of
hours ago,

2220
01:40:28,831 --> 01:40:32,880
it's like the integration part and I
think perhaps that's what we lost in the

2221
01:40:32,881 --> 01:40:36,270
sixties.
We were so hung up on the veil getting

2222
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:40,020
pierced and in my dad's,
one of the best quotes is um,

2223
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:42,870
in order to understand the sixties,
you must understand the fifties,

2224
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:45,990
right?
What a change in the fifties were just,

2225
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:49,080
you know,
very lock and step and white picket

2226
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:50,610
fence,
two point five children,

2227
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:51,571
cart,
you know,

2228
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:53,040
suit and tie,
hair short.

2229
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,520
Like there was no variation.

2230
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:59,260
And we burst that bubble.
But even at the integration level,

2231
01:40:59,261 --> 01:41:01,840
it just wasn't,
wasn't media enough,

2232
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,250
you know,
we still,

2233
01:41:03,251 --> 01:41:06,100
we elected Richard Nixon in 1968.
I mean,

2234
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:08,410
granted Robert Kennedy was shot,
but still,

2235
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:11,800
you know,
and here we are 50 years later and look

2236
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:12,880
what we're doing.
So,

2237
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:16,000
you know,
it is great to turn on and I liked

2238
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:18,940
people turning on and I think it's
fantastic and it's a great thing to talk

2239
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:20,320
about like you are in it,
you know,

2240
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,810
you have a huge megaphone and getting
people to do that.

2241
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:26,410
But what are they going to do different?
That's what I'm more concerned with.

2242
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,750
They're going to consider their life in
a different way.

2243
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:32,510
And I think that yeah,
that in many people maybe,

2244
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,800
maybe not at all of us,
but in many people that changes the

2245
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:40,600
direction of the path that you're on.
It changes the way you communicate with

2246
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:43,840
people,
changes your understanding of each other

2247
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,050
in your understanding of the connections
that we have with each other.

2248
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,520
yes.
Um,

2249
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:53,710
I think there's a giant chunk of people
that are what you would call a

2250
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:59,460
influencers in this country,
whether it's politicians or ceos of

2251
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:03,340
large corporations casters.
Well,

2252
01:42:03,341 --> 01:42:04,630
I mean,
I'm just going to say people that

2253
01:42:04,631 --> 01:42:06,870
haven't had this experience,
these,

2254
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:11,020
these influencers that live in this,
a very flat plane of existence,

2255
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:13,690
of acquiring material possessions,
getting your dick sucked,

2256
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:15,510
doing a line of coke,
driving in your limo,

2257
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:19,020
all the different shit that a lot of
people like look forward to that like

2258
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:23,260
ultimately might not really be important
or important.

2259
01:42:23,261 --> 01:42:25,690
It might feel importaNt in the moment,
you know,

2260
01:42:25,691 --> 01:42:28,060
and this ego gratification sort of a
way,

2261
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:33,540
but without that ego obliterating
experience to put it all into

2262
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:36,490
perspective,
you might not understand that that state

2263
01:42:36,491 --> 01:42:40,810
of mind is even achievable.
Like the undeniable ego shattering

2264
01:42:40,811 --> 01:42:45,590
experience of like a severe mushroom
trip or a dmt trip or you know,

2265
01:42:45,591 --> 01:42:46,900
any,
anything along those lines.

2266
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:52,270
It's so beneficial in that it gives you
that momentary break from the ego and

2267
01:42:52,271 --> 01:42:56,200
from this mo,
the momentum of the race that you might

2268
01:42:56,201 --> 01:42:58,150
not really want to be in.
You know what I mean?

2269
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:02,020
There's a lot of people that are doing
things they fucking hate all day long

2270
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:04,390
Just in order to acquire shit that they
don't really need.

2271
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:05,850
Yeah man.
And that's what I was like,

2272
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:09,670
the point I was trying to make earlier
is like this hand that you're deAlt is

2273
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:14,590
bunk because you're like so many people
are trapped in that thing of like doing

2274
01:43:14,591 --> 01:43:15,890
something they hate.
right.

2275
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,770
But do they have to be like.
It sounds like

2276
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:21,850
they think they have to be.
That's what I'm talking about.

2277
01:43:21,851 --> 01:43:24,100
They think they have to be,
but no they don't.

2278
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:26,020
They can breAk free.
They can pierce the veil.

2279
01:43:26,021 --> 01:43:30,250
They can go into a dmt trip or gotten a
flotation take and break free and then

2280
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:36,810
even just by quitting some fucking
shitty job and doing something you love

2281
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:38,740
it.
Why don't more people do that because

2282
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:41,830
they're scared.
Is that what is 100 percent?

2283
01:43:41,831 --> 01:43:43,390
Yeah.
People are afraid of change.

2284
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,940
They're afraid of the unknown.
They're afraid of uncertainty.

2285
01:43:45,941 --> 01:43:49,210
They're afraid of failure for sure.
If you offer them some really

2286
01:43:49,211 --> 01:43:52,370
convenient,
stupid job that is absolutely

2287
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,800
going to stay there for them.
Or hey man,

2288
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:58,280
take a chance to open a pottery studio,
I'm going to go broke.

2289
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:00,170
People are terrified of failure.
Yeah,

2290
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:02,900
I mean I think you're right,
but I also think there's a level of it

2291
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:06,650
that's also kind of like graduate school
in the sense that maybe a lot of people

2292
01:44:06,651 --> 01:44:09,540
are just addicted to being pacified that
like,

2293
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:12,260
you know,
I get my three hours of television that

2294
01:44:12,261 --> 01:44:13,740
night and I get my,
you know,

2295
01:44:13,741 --> 01:44:18,230
and they're even considering that notion
of what you're talking about beyond the

2296
01:44:18,231 --> 01:44:19,220
realm.
Well,

2297
01:44:19,221 --> 01:44:20,780
you know,
that experience keep me plugged in.

2298
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:21,561
I'm cool.
You know,

2299
01:44:21,561 --> 01:44:23,450
that expreSsion,
the comfort zone is beautiful,

2300
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:25,340
but nothing grows there.
uh,

2301
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:26,840
it's,
it,

2302
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:27,850
it's a great,
you know,

2303
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:29,630
it's nice to be comfortable.
It's beautiful,

2304
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:32,450
relaxed,
but you don't get better at anything.

2305
01:44:32,451 --> 01:44:34,670
You don't get better at life,
you don't grow.

2306
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:38,420
And we're scared of uncertainty.
Now we want to survive.

2307
01:44:38,421 --> 01:44:40,760
We don't want to starve to death.
We don't want to be a failure.

2308
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:44,810
We don't want to be that guy that used
to be on tv and now he's a security

2309
01:44:44,811 --> 01:44:45,640
guard,
you know?

2310
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:49,880
Then all those things that like the fear
of not being successful,

2311
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,300
so stifling it.
GOt it.

2312
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:53,270
It's so,
isn't it?

2313
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,910
When you say that,
who just immediately just triggered my,

2314
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:58,070
you know,
my own life and all the failures.

2315
01:44:58,071 --> 01:45:00,950
I've had all the fuck ups falling flat
on my face,

2316
01:45:00,951 --> 01:45:01,581
you know,
many,

2317
01:45:01,581 --> 01:45:02,540
many,
many times.

2318
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:07,130
BuT like getting back up,
it's like that's where the work is,

2319
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,380
that's where the,
that's where the awakening is.

2320
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:10,310
I mean,
it wasn't like,

2321
01:45:10,311 --> 01:45:13,190
hey,
everything is going perfectly and oh

2322
01:45:13,191 --> 01:45:15,910
well isn't this all my life?
And since rolling out on a red carpet

2323
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:20,920
and then I turned on or something
happened and I touched the face of

2324
01:45:21,351 --> 01:45:21,950
enlightenment.

2325
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:24,020
NO,
it's because I fell in the dirt and you

2326
01:45:24,021 --> 01:45:27,390
take those risks and shit happens and
you and you,

2327
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:29,720
the grist for the mill is wronged us
would say.

2328
01:45:29,721 --> 01:45:32,090
And you know,
you have that grist for the mill that

2329
01:45:32,091 --> 01:45:34,970
makes it so much jucier and falling
funding your face.

2330
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,360
It's essential.
And I think essential You can apply that

2331
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:43,220
same sort of thinking to our entire
civilization.

2332
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:46,700
And I think right now we might've
skinned our knees.

2333
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:49,850
We might've fallen on our face,
we might've gone facedown in the mud.

2334
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:50,930
and I'm like,
oh fuck.

2335
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:53,840
And I think you've got to get up and
realize that we fucked it up.

2336
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,210
You know?
and we'll see how bad we fucked it up.

2337
01:45:56,211 --> 01:45:58,520
And who knows.
Because one of the things about having

2338
01:45:58,521 --> 01:46:02,630
an outsider in this,
what I think is an impossibly corrupt

2339
01:46:03,230 --> 01:46:07,550
unfixable foundation filled with
bullshit,

2340
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:09,950
which is what I think our society is
built on.

2341
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:14,180
Whether it's special interest groups,
corporate greed or lobbyists or all the

2342
01:46:14,181 --> 01:46:16,040
chaos,
private prisons.

2343
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:20,930
And fucking the war on drugs,
all the chaos that I think any rational

2344
01:46:20,931 --> 01:46:24,020
person that's not connected to it in any
sort of a way where you're making profit

2345
01:46:24,021 --> 01:46:28,790
off of would agree like this is an
insane way for an enlightened society to

2346
01:46:28,791 --> 01:46:30,260
behave and act.
It's broken,

2347
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:31,700
right?
Unfixable.

2348
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:34,220
Just just bullshit,
right?

2349
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:39,970
That the awareness of that is more and
more exposed today online and in

2350
01:46:44,121 --> 01:46:48,470
conversations and people are more aware
of that than any other time in human

2351
01:46:48,471 --> 01:46:50,130
history.
But I feel like we're like

2352
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:54,120
a giant battleship,
but it takes a lot to turn that fucker.

2353
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,080
It takes on a lot of,
a lot of thinking and action.

2354
01:46:58,090 --> 01:47:01,110
It takes a long time for that thing to
actually spin around.

2355
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,280
Yeah,
that's right.

2356
01:47:02,281 --> 01:47:03,330
That's right.
And the first,

2357
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:05,280
you know,
the first step in that is like the

2358
01:47:05,281 --> 01:47:08,670
acknowledgement that hey,
we skinned our knees or maybe fell flat

2359
01:47:08,730 --> 01:47:12,660
face down into the mode or something.
And is the acknowledgement that that is

2360
01:47:12,661 --> 01:47:14,430
the case.
That's the scenario we're in.

2361
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:18,630
And which is why I'm always so
frustrated in that like,

2362
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:20,670
you know,
the general narrative or the general

2363
01:47:20,671 --> 01:47:23,370
rhetoric,
especially in politics is,

2364
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:25,650
you know,
the wrong conversations always being

2365
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:27,870
had.
Nobody's talking about the right shit.

2366
01:47:27,871 --> 01:47:30,270
We're treating the symptom.
We never treat the disease.

2367
01:47:30,271 --> 01:47:32,120
We're just treating the flu,
you know,

2368
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:36,780
blowing her notes constantly and never,
ever acknowledging the disease.

2369
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:37,973
You know,
bernie,

2370
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,740
bernie sanders touched on acknowledging
the disease.

2371
01:47:40,741 --> 01:47:44,520
He was the first guy.
WhAt really in a long time to make it

2372
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:49,521
that far and acknowledged the disease.
We are at risk of becoming an oligarchy.

2373
01:47:49,681 --> 01:47:52,410
It's the top one percent that is ruling
the country.

2374
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,910
He may be the first guy ever.
Right?

2375
01:47:53,911 --> 01:47:55,500
I mean if you really stop and think
about it,

2376
01:47:55,501 --> 01:47:58,320
like who got that close to the
democratic nomination,

2377
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,740
the.
Yeah.

2378
01:47:59,741 --> 01:48:01,230
Other than mcgovern.
Yeah.

2379
01:48:01,231 --> 01:48:03,690
But I mean,
I think in know older,

2380
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,010
older times,
you know,

2381
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:07,270
in the 19th century there was kind of,
you know,

2382
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:12,460
hints that this could happen and kind of
people in senior waiting a,

2383
01:48:12,461 --> 01:48:14,460
hey,
the industrial revolution and carnegies

2384
01:48:14,461 --> 01:48:15,960
and the mellons and the rockefellers.
Like,

2385
01:48:15,961 --> 01:48:19,630
watch out that this could get dangerous.
Uh,

2386
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:22,110
eisenhower warned of the military
industrial complex.

2387
01:48:22,111 --> 01:48:23,160
I think it was a republican.

2388
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:25,110
Um,
and that was a creepy speech,

2389
01:48:25,111 --> 01:48:27,660
right?
They're creepy speech but fascinating at

2390
01:48:27,661 --> 01:48:28,590
the same time.
But yeAh.

2391
01:48:28,591 --> 01:48:29,760
So.
But bernie took it.

2392
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:34,770
He did talk about the disease,
which was fantastic.

2393
01:48:34,771 --> 01:48:38,910
So it is out there that you know,
that we have these fundamental problems

2394
01:48:38,911 --> 01:48:42,330
until you fix the fundamental problem,
nothing else is going to get better,

2395
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,970
which is essentially taking the money
out of the game.

2396
01:48:45,290 --> 01:48:46,123
Yeah,
right.

2397
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,180
Well,
that's what I do think it's fixable.

2398
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:51,000
I disagree with you in that,
that I do think the machine is,

2399
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,770
it's fixable.
How it fixable.

2400
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,900
Take the money out.
That's unfixable.

2401
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:56,880
No,
it's the whole thing runs on money.

2402
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:58,440
How are you going to take the money out?
Have you read?

2403
01:48:58,441 --> 01:48:59,610
Um,
republic last,

2404
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,300
the lawrence lessig book?
No,

2405
01:49:01,301 --> 01:49:02,100
you gotta read it,
man.

2406
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:05,190
Fascinating.
Was this solution or watched his twentY

2407
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:07,130
minute ted talk.
You can get the whole book and that was

2408
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:08,003
the solution.

2409
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,410
Get rid of lobbyists.
Yeah,

2410
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:11,820
man,
that's easier said than done.

2411
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:12,650
I know,
I know.

2412
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:14,730
I know.
Some of my trump is actually working to

2413
01:49:14,731 --> 01:49:16,680
do that,
whereas someone like hillary is not

2414
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:18,480
like,
he's already put in a bunch of

2415
01:49:18,481 --> 01:49:21,360
regulations to make sure that people
cannot become lobbyists,

2416
01:49:21,361 --> 01:49:24,060
but at a certain amount of time after
leaving off after leaving office.

2417
01:49:24,061 --> 01:49:29,061
But he also has like the prisoner elect
office is crawling at the same time.

2418
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:30,750
It's crawling with lobbyists.
Yeah.

2419
01:49:30,751 --> 01:49:31,770
Who knows?
You know,

2420
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:33,060
I mean,
I'm not a trump supporter,

2421
01:49:33,061 --> 01:49:33,894
but I'm not.
Uh,

2422
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:35,340
I'm,
I'm not.

2423
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:40,750
I'm not convinced that having this
complete outsider who's also a guy who's

2424
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:44,640
been feeding this machine with money and
making these massive political

2425
01:49:44,641 --> 01:49:47,560
contributions so he understands the
system and how works.

2426
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:48,733
I'm

2427
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:52,840
not completely,
I'm not completely denying the

2428
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:54,610
possibility that he might present some
good.

2429
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,950
I just think he's the wrong guy for the
job.

2430
01:49:56,951 --> 01:49:59,380
I do believe in the outsider thing.
I love that.

2431
01:49:59,381 --> 01:50:00,680
That's great.
That's a great part of him.

2432
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:02,840
I just,
bernie would have been fascinating.

2433
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:05,260
Bernie would have been fascinated.
Costs me a shitload of money,

2434
01:50:05,261 --> 01:50:06,710
but I would have been willing to take
that chance.

2435
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:10,210
I would loved to see it.
I love to see what the fuck would happen

2436
01:50:10,211 --> 01:50:13,270
because that guy doesn't give a shit and
he's not.

2437
01:50:13,271 --> 01:50:14,560
You can't buy him,
man.

2438
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:16,970
He can't buy him in and you've got to
watch this,

2439
01:50:16,971 --> 01:50:19,030
this lawrence lessig tuck.
It's a few years old now,

2440
01:50:19,031 --> 01:50:22,840
but it really just,
it kind of rips apart and puts

2441
01:50:22,841 --> 01:50:24,840
everything out on the whiteboard and
into a,

2442
01:50:24,841 --> 01:50:27,520
like a keynote presentation about even
the,

2443
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,370
you know,
the most well intentioned to politicians

2444
01:50:30,371 --> 01:50:31,180
who are great.

2445
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:33,100
Mr. Smith goes to Washington kind of
shit.

2446
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:36,430
Just great people who go in there with
the best of intentions,

2447
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:38,140
you know,
at some point,

2448
01:50:38,141 --> 01:50:40,720
you know.
Then they end up spending 25 percent of

2449
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:43,120
their time inside of the phone bank,
the democratic,

2450
01:50:43,121 --> 01:50:46,660
the dnc phone bank,
begging people for money and I know they

2451
01:50:46,661 --> 01:50:51,130
do that and it's across the street from
the capital so it's not too far and it

2452
01:50:51,131 --> 01:50:53,200
just ended escalates and it's a
snowball.

2453
01:50:53,201 --> 01:50:56,510
Just go more and more and then it just
becomes even the best intent.

2454
01:50:56,860 --> 01:51:01,720
It just out of politics.
Then you have only people with money who

2455
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:03,910
get into politics because they have so
much money.

2456
01:51:03,911 --> 01:51:06,880
They don't need anybody else's money.
Hence Donald Trump.

2457
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:09,580
Yeah,
but I mean if you did it like a,

2458
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:11,440
you know,
first of all,

2459
01:51:11,530 --> 01:51:14,620
if you did it like the uk,
does it shortened the election season.

2460
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:15,720
You know,
first we got,

2461
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:17,610
that's a great first step.
You know,

2462
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:19,870
you can't make it 18 months.
It's insane.

2463
01:51:19,871 --> 01:51:21,850
And the amount of money,
team sport,

2464
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:24,220
it's going on forever.
We get a root root,

2465
01:51:24,221 --> 01:51:27,460
rah rah.
They got debates and the season.

2466
01:51:27,461 --> 01:51:29,760
Yeah man.
Great television people where they're

2467
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:32,200
reading,
they're fucking blue and make America

2468
01:51:32,201 --> 01:51:34,450
great again.
Hats or the amount of money that it

2469
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:35,830
takes to play that.
I know,

2470
01:51:35,831 --> 01:51:38,350
right?
What we seen making per day.

2471
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:41,330
I'll make America great again.
I bet millions now.

2472
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:43,960
He was making like 80 grand a day or
something.

2473
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,780
Something stupid.
It's so bad.

2474
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:49,180
It's those stupid looking ads too.
They're not.

2475
01:51:49,190 --> 01:51:51,670
It's not even a good design.
It's like somebody made it at the mall,

2476
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:54,760
you know those little hat shops.
Would you want it to say bobby loves

2477
01:51:54,761 --> 01:51:56,100
jesse.
All right,

2478
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:59,200
love jesse.
Make America great again.

2479
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:01,630
Hat white letters.
I'm the man.

2480
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:05,950
I'm the fucking man.
I got the hat on fucking man.

2481
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:07,580
I don't even know what that means.
Yeah,

2482
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,570
he doesn't know what it means either.
Well,

2483
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:10,720
I don't know.
I mean,

2484
01:52:10,770 --> 01:52:13,930
America has never been greater in terms
of like be safer,

2485
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:16,330
more access to medicine,
more access to information,

2486
01:52:16,331 --> 01:52:19,690
more access to education.
That's never been better in that way.

2487
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:20,640
But like,
uh,

2488
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:24,160
you know,
who are the rent our education rankings,

2489
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:26,570
you know,
it's sort of in the world in a world

2490
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:28,060
where we're used to place,
you know,

2491
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:30,910
the typical high school graduate
graduate in the year,

2492
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:32,860
like 1960,
you know,

2493
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:37,210
it's like going to college and brent and
ranked number one in global math,

2494
01:52:37,211 --> 01:52:38,170
science,
you know,

2495
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,980
that's because the rest of the world was
in the stone age and we were uh,

2496
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:45,020
we were the only civilization I think.
I think we were,

2497
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,010
we had just started

2498
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,890
civilization back then and no one knew
about it yet.

2499
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:53,510
And they all caught on and we got fat
off twinkies and the mall and fucking

2500
01:52:53,511 --> 01:52:57,470
walmart poisoned us.
And then thIs shit from fracking that

2501
01:52:57,471 --> 01:53:00,110
definitely got into the wall.
I don't know,

2502
01:53:00,111 --> 01:53:02,660
man.
I think everyone on,

2503
01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:05,750
I'm fine with that too.
I'm a pessimist in some,

2504
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:09,200
in some forms,
but I'm an optimist and others and what

2505
01:53:09,201 --> 01:53:13,920
I'm optimistic about is that people care
and that this,

2506
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:16,580
this world that we live in,
that this is a,

2507
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:18,620
you know,
like when everybody was crying after

2508
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:21,140
trump got elected and part of me was
like,

2509
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:23,330
well this is so preposterous,
like why these people crying?

2510
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:28,130
But the other part of me was like,
that is when things get done is when you

2511
01:53:28,131 --> 01:53:30,460
have this outpouring of emotion and then
people you know,

2512
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:33,850
like remember when those people were
marching down wilshire and it was just

2513
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:37,430
fucking huge line of people,
like hundreds of thousand people that

2514
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:40,550
shut down wilshire and these people
filming it with drones from overhead.

2515
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:41,450
I was like,
wow,

2516
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:45,620
that's a crazy response to this guy
winning the presidency.

2517
01:53:45,621 --> 01:53:47,930
And the people were like hoping the
electors,

2518
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:50,390
you know,
the electoral college people wouldn't

2519
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:53,660
elect him and they were,
they would act on their fuck you.

2520
01:53:53,661 --> 01:53:55,790
It's not gonna happen like you'Re
playing a game.

2521
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:59,060
he won the game and you can't,
you can't take it away from him.

2522
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:00,950
After he won the game,
like he didn't cheat,

2523
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:04,130
he won the game.
So this is the game and this is how the

2524
01:54:04,131 --> 01:54:06,410
game works.
Russia,

2525
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,410
listen to this is the game is how the
game works.

2526
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,510
Now you've got to figure out why is this
game in place?

2527
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:14,300
Why do you have this fucking goofy game?
Why do you have this representative

2528
01:54:14,301 --> 01:54:14,920
government?
Why?

2529
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:17,240
Why do we continue this?
You know,

2530
01:54:17,241 --> 01:54:21,350
and if we can slowly move that
battleship and towards a more rational

2531
01:54:21,351 --> 01:54:22,010
place.

2532
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:23,000
Yeah,
you're right.

2533
01:54:23,001 --> 01:54:24,740
And it does come from a consciousness
shift.

2534
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:27,440
That's the first step.
Always comes from a consciousness shift.

2535
01:54:27,650 --> 01:54:29,920
I think pot,
I think legal pot,

2536
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,990
real gateway.
I really do.

2537
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:35,840
I really do because I think it calms
people down.

2538
01:54:35,841 --> 01:54:39,560
It makes people nicer and I think just
that alone,

2539
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:41,960
it's like the opposite of what alcohol
does.

2540
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:44,870
that's true.
It's definitely does not increAse in

2541
01:54:45,110 --> 01:54:49,190
aggression or for confidence.
It doesn't increase confidence At all.

2542
01:54:49,191 --> 01:54:50,960
It's the opposite for me.
It makes me.

2543
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,000
That's why I don't smoke.
The more vulnerable,

2544
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,950
you don't smoke it.
I like it.

2545
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:59,060
Don't like something changed in me.
I did when I was at duke when I was a

2546
01:54:59,061 --> 01:55:00,800
teenager,
like loved it,

2547
01:55:00,801 --> 01:55:03,320
man,
when my dad had and that was my life,

2548
01:55:03,321 --> 01:55:06,740
but you know,
I take it now and it's just paranoia,

2549
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:09,440
massive.
And also the confidence thing.

2550
01:55:09,441 --> 01:55:14,441
It does not bring out my best.
It makes me feel like if we smoked and

2551
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:18,030
we did this podcast,
so be freaking out and I have to say to

2552
01:55:19,690 --> 01:55:24,690
sound like an idiot,
don't get told me I wouldn't be like

2553
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:28,400
that.
So it just does not bring up my best.

2554
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:31,070
So how long ago is this switch?
When did it happen to you?

2555
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,710
Quite a while.
I mean,

2556
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:34,200
I'm 43,
you know,

2557
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:38,090
no more than 15 years ago.
So that's when you stopped smoking 15

2558
01:55:38,091 --> 01:55:40,220
years ago.
I stopped yesterday.

2559
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:44,260
I'm Still freaking because he
yesterday's but

2560
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:46,140
yeah,
about that.

2561
01:55:46,141 --> 01:55:47,580
Yeah.
So,

2562
01:55:47,581 --> 01:55:48,750
um,
what,

2563
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:52,880
do you do anything these days?
Not so to psychedelics or.

2564
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:54,260
No,
not really.

2565
01:55:54,261 --> 01:55:55,520
No I don't,
but um,

2566
01:55:55,550 --> 01:55:58,190
yeah,
I keep a place in my heart for the

2567
01:55:58,191 --> 01:56:00,590
psychedelic experience.
Should it arise again,

2568
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:01,280
um,
you know,

2569
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:05,200
in between english monthly in between
the egg and um,

2570
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:06,170
you know,
uh,

2571
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:06,811
yeah,
I mean I'm,

2572
01:56:06,811 --> 01:56:08,930
I'm open to that and should the
opportunity arise,

2573
01:56:08,931 --> 01:56:10,300
I'm down for it.
Um,

2574
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,110
I mean with the psychedelic thing,
I just,

2575
01:56:12,111 --> 01:56:13,670
um,
yeah,

2576
01:56:13,671 --> 01:56:14,780
I mean,
I am open to it.

2577
01:56:14,781 --> 01:56:18,050
I just,
I kind of did kind of hit the Alan Watts

2578
01:56:18,051 --> 01:56:19,580
wall in a way like,
you know,

2579
01:56:19,581 --> 01:56:21,080
the Alan Watts thing about,
um,

2580
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:22,341
uh,
you know,

2581
01:56:22,341 --> 01:56:25,490
I got the phone call and then I learned
to hang up the phone.

2582
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:29,570
What does Alan Watts thing,
how's that work as the quote goes?

2583
01:56:29,571 --> 01:56:30,410
Something like,
um,

2584
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:34,280
I got the phone call and then I kind of
learned to hang up the phone.

2585
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:37,220
I didn't need to stay on the phone with
me.

2586
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:37,991
It's like,
oh,

2587
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:38,830
I see,
I see.

2588
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:41,590
So you got the message.
He got the message to continually get

2589
01:56:41,591 --> 01:56:43,470
the message over and over and over and
over again.

2590
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:45,400
Mckenna,
I think was in that boat too.

2591
01:56:45,401 --> 01:56:48,040
Before his death,
they were saying that he talked a lot

2592
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:49,780
about it,
but he really wasn't doing anything

2593
01:56:49,781 --> 01:56:50,710
anymore.
Oh really?

2594
01:56:50,711 --> 01:56:52,540
Oh,
I didn't know that he smoked a lot of

2595
01:56:52,541 --> 01:56:54,760
pot though.
Did smoke a little pot because I always

2596
01:56:54,761 --> 01:56:55,080
remember it,

2597
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:55,913
terrence,
you know,

2598
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:58,670
the thing that struck people have his
room

2599
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:01,820
pete ability is that.
Well it's true,

2600
01:57:01,821 --> 01:57:05,600
but I know it's tough to have 5,000
fucking mushroom trips and with jesus

2601
01:57:05,601 --> 01:57:07,860
christ,
I mean I've done acid what 200 times or

2602
01:57:07,861 --> 01:57:11,810
something you could probably see like
legally insane.

2603
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:13,130
Right?
I don't think.

2604
01:57:13,131 --> 01:57:16,310
I think like there'S a certain amount of
acid trips you do where they used to

2605
01:57:16,850 --> 01:57:19,970
classify you as being legally insane.
Yeah.

2606
01:57:19,971 --> 01:57:21,830
I mean maybe you get some money from the
government,

2607
01:57:21,831 --> 01:57:23,540
bro.
You hook it up much.

2608
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:25,740
Probably 50 bucks.
I don't know

2609
01:57:27,890 --> 01:57:32,240
if he just ran around saying that I
broke my brain and I'm disabled.

2610
01:57:32,241 --> 01:57:34,250
I bet you could email the system.

2611
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,260
I use that.
It's really funny.

2612
01:57:36,261 --> 01:57:36,921
You know,
I had um,

2613
01:57:36,921 --> 01:57:40,510
it reminds me,
I used to have a pretty serious hard

2614
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:42,350
drug problem to which hard drugs.
Yeah.

2615
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:43,970
Which I,
I've gotten,

2616
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,610
you know,
which one's a heroin and crack and oh

2617
01:57:46,611 --> 01:57:48,080
damn.
Gotten through it.

2618
01:57:48,110 --> 01:57:50,510
The needle or the smart starting
smoking.

2619
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:52,580
Smoking the needles.
No needles.

2620
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:53,690
Yeah.
Stayed away from that,

2621
01:57:53,691 --> 01:57:55,940
but you know,
made it through and I'm good.

2622
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:58,370
How'd you get on that?
How to get on it?

2623
01:57:59,290 --> 01:58:00,530
Um,
oh,

2624
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:03,830
pain.
He had some injuries or something.

2625
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:05,660
No pain.
Emotional pain,

2626
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:07,310
emotional pain,
emotional suffering,

2627
01:58:07,311 --> 01:58:10,100
pain.
Last aimless wandering the world,

2628
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:11,450
aimless.
Not knowing what to do.

2629
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:16,070
And that was the escape was the heroine.
Somebody introduced me to it about that

2630
01:58:16,071 --> 01:58:19,100
period in time and it just was like,
oh wow.

2631
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:23,020
You know,
heroin has the great ability of um,

2632
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:27,200
and it's really seductive and really
fucked up of making you think that your

2633
01:58:27,201 --> 01:58:29,750
life is okay when you're in the gutter.

2634
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:32,690
Wow.
It has that sort of,

2635
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:36,860
that shooting that it just kind of
bubble it puts over you.

2636
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:40,430
You can be literally living in an
alleyway.

2637
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:42,790
Highend heroin thinking you got it going
on.

2638
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:43,901
Wow.
Yeah.

2639
01:58:43,901 --> 01:58:46,360
It's really weird and perverse like
that.

2640
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:48,060
And at that time in my life.
YEah.

2641
01:58:48,061 --> 01:58:49,210
I mean,
my dad just died.

2642
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:51,130
Um,
and you know,

2643
01:58:51,131 --> 01:58:52,570
when he died,
what with it,

2644
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:57,630
what went with it was kind of my life up
until I was 22 up until that point.

2645
01:58:57,641 --> 01:58:59,740
Like,
my life was in that bubble,

2646
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:01,870
you know,
he was larger than life.

2647
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:03,910
He was famous,
you know,

2648
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:07,420
girls came with that work,
came with that scene,

2649
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:10,690
came with that,
friends came with that and when he died

2650
01:59:10,691 --> 01:59:14,200
that just went poof.
Girls want to bang you because you were.

2651
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:15,071
Oh,
of course.

2652
01:59:15,071 --> 01:59:16,270
The leary course.
Yeah.

2653
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:19,240
Really nice.
It worked out for awhile.

2654
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:22,510
Did you put on like a guru attitude?
Like,

2655
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:26,440
oh god laughs,
I've got it all going on ladies at that

2656
01:59:26,441 --> 01:59:27,274
time,
that,

2657
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:30,010
that stage in my life now it's a
disaster.

2658
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:33,770
And I tried to do that now though on
occasion.

2659
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:34,511
Oh.
But no,

2660
01:59:34,511 --> 01:59:36,090
I had a good story man.
So it's really funny,

2661
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:38,980
like you were talking about soliciting
the government for money for being an

2662
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:40,600
acid casualties,
which is a good idea.

2663
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:43,270
But I was really high on crack once,
um,

2664
01:59:43,410 --> 01:59:46,150
and just kind of on a bender,
just losing my mind and crack.

2665
01:59:46,151 --> 01:59:48,550
And I thought in the middle of the
night,

2666
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:54,090
be a really good idea to join the cia
and that they would want me,

2667
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:56,590
me specifically being like tim leary's
kit,

2668
01:59:56,660 --> 02:00:01,220
they'd want me because I have access to
shit that they want access to.

2669
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:04,750
Like I can be an insight.
I was a mole and it was high on crack

2670
02:00:04,751 --> 02:00:05,590
and I downloaded.

2671
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:10,180
I filled out the form that deep.
I got that deep.

2672
02:00:10,181 --> 02:00:12,220
I spent hours on it.
It's really long.

2673
02:00:12,221 --> 02:00:15,580
Complicated though.
The whole kind of joined the cia,

2674
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:17,380
printed out,
sent it in the mail.

2675
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:21,310
you're in the cia,
you there with anderson cooper and he

2676
02:00:21,311 --> 02:00:25,210
worked for cnn and you're in there and
never heard back.

2677
02:00:25,211 --> 02:00:27,120
But I never heard back.
Never,

2678
02:00:27,410 --> 02:00:30,430
never seen laughing,
but he just laughed and threw it in the

2679
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:32,770
garbage and shirt.
But it was really funny and kind of a

2680
02:00:32,771 --> 02:00:35,320
great delusional high on drugs moment.
Wow.

2681
02:00:35,321 --> 02:00:37,510
So what did you think that you were
going to do?

2682
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:42,750
Like as a operative going to do it.
You have to fix it from the inside with

2683
02:00:42,851 --> 02:00:46,520
crack
like that.

2684
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:48,970
Wow.
Something crazy,

2685
02:00:48,971 --> 02:00:50,920
you know,
just that's what a crackhead does.

2686
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:52,870
How did you get another crack in the
heroin?

2687
02:00:53,710 --> 02:00:55,270
Um,
yeah,

2688
02:00:55,300 --> 02:01:00,300
just recovery.
Did you go the 12 step away or narcotics

2689
02:01:00,881 --> 02:01:01,420
anonymous?

2690
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:02,370
That kind of stuff?
Yeah,

2691
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:03,600
worked for me.
How does,

2692
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:05,920
now,
is that one of those things you have to

2693
02:01:05,921 --> 02:01:09,220
continually visit?
Do you have to constantly have meetings

2694
02:01:09,221 --> 02:01:10,240
and stuff?
Um,

2695
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:11,440
well,
you know,

2696
02:01:11,441 --> 02:01:14,950
I'm kind of a,
you know,

2697
02:01:14,951 --> 02:01:19,780
I'm kind of in a way as a card carrying
members where I'm kind of not the best

2698
02:01:19,781 --> 02:01:23,500
card carrying member of it and I break
from tradition and a little bit in that

2699
02:01:23,501 --> 02:01:25,060
like,
I don't know,

2700
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:27,320
I'm not a zealot.
Sure.

2701
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:28,720
Maybe.
Um,

2702
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:29,770
yeah.
Maybe you do,

2703
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:34,120
but for me I just happened to like it.
I just enjoy it.

2704
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:36,670
Whether or not I have to go and all my
god,

2705
02:01:36,671 --> 02:01:38,800
I'm gonna die.
If I don't know I'm gonna end up back in

2706
02:01:38,801 --> 02:01:39,634
the gutter of.
I don't.

2707
02:01:39,930 --> 02:01:39,980
I

2708
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,230
don't know.
I believe there's a little hysteria with

2709
02:01:42,231 --> 02:01:44,390
that and that's kind of like the party
line,

2710
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:48,410
which sometimes bothers me.
It bothers a lot of people,

2711
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:51,670
sort of disempowerment,
disempowerment.

2712
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:54,650
I don't believe that to any with any
tradition or anything like,

2713
02:01:54,651 --> 02:01:57,830
oh my god,
if you leave us the shit's gonna hit the

2714
02:01:57,831 --> 02:01:58,391
fan.
I mean,

2715
02:01:58,391 --> 02:02:00,680
you stop and think about a lot of
destructive things you did when you were

2716
02:02:00,681 --> 02:02:02,810
younger that you don't do now.
Well,

2717
02:02:02,970 --> 02:02:06,170
I don't need a 12 step program to tell
me not to do stupid shit.

2718
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:07,010
Yeah.
I just,

2719
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:09,500
I just know it's stupid shit and so I
don't do it anymore.

2720
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:13,880
But the idea that you could potentially
fall into that is what they hold over

2721
02:02:13,881 --> 02:02:16,190
your head,
but it's not that simple.

2722
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:16,881
Like,
oh my god,

2723
02:02:16,881 --> 02:02:18,320
I know heroin was going to kill me,
so I'm just.

2724
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:19,480
I'm just going to stop doing it.

2725
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:21,860
It's not that rational.
Sadly.

2726
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:24,530
I wish it was that difference.
What's the disconnect?

2727
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:29,770
The disconnect is that in order to bill
wilson was really a groundbreaking dude.

2728
02:02:30,710 --> 02:02:32,330
Well,
he was also an acid head,

2729
02:02:32,331 --> 02:02:34,990
which is really kind of crazy.
Bill wilson being the guy who founded

2730
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:39,920
alcoholics anonymous five times.
He also thought that acid could be a

2731
02:02:39,921 --> 02:02:42,590
viable treatment method for people that
are alcoholics.

2732
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:47,890
It's completely ignored today and his
thoughts and ideas about that completely

2733
02:02:48,921 --> 02:02:52,340
ignored by people in recovery because
they think that no,

2734
02:02:52,341 --> 02:02:52,970
no,
no.

2735
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:56,170
You don't get get cleaned by taking
something else.

2736
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,360
They hate it.
Yeah.

2737
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:58,760
And I before,
um,

2738
02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:00,830
you know,
that sort of got popular and before the

2739
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:03,860
documentary came out and all that about
exposing bill wilson,

2740
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:05,750
I used it to,
below,

2741
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:08,540
you know,
a member's minds with that to do not.

2742
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:11,750
He did it and he had correspondence with
my dad when he was at harvard.

2743
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:13,680
I'm sure he did.
I had some really interesting.

2744
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:15,560
These letters are fantastic.
Um,

2745
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:17,990
and um,
yeah,

2746
02:03:17,991 --> 02:03:22,991
he called it the great egos sublimate
her and thought it could be the solution

2747
02:03:23,301 --> 02:03:26,490
for alcoholism and he did not change his
sobriety date,

2748
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:31,220
which is highly controversial.
Sobriety date,

2749
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:33,500
friday date.
Like when he said he got sober,

2750
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:35,270
he still,
when he died,

2751
02:03:35,271 --> 02:03:39,710
he said he had whatever 48 years sober,
but he was still doing acid when he had

2752
02:03:39,711 --> 02:03:41,690
stopped doing acid.
But typically,

2753
02:03:41,691 --> 02:03:42,320
you know,
in the,

2754
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:44,330
in a world if you do asset,
that's it.

2755
02:03:44,331 --> 02:03:46,760
You start over,
you start day one and day one.

2756
02:03:46,761 --> 02:03:48,170
But he didn't,
he did not.

2757
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:51,930
I looked at acid has been completely
different than an intoxicant like

2758
02:03:52,070 --> 02:03:55,040
alcohol.
It was a neuro psychotropic therapeutic

2759
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:57,800
agent you referred to.
Well,

2760
02:03:57,801 --> 02:04:00,830
I think that is what it is.
And I think this blanket statement,

2761
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:03,770
you know,
drugs that word drugs,

2762
02:04:03,771 --> 02:04:04,590
it's just like,
it's,

2763
02:04:04,590 --> 02:04:07,400
it applies to too many things to do too
many different things.

2764
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:08,930
That's right.
It's like food,

2765
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:11,330
you know,
food is bad for you.

2766
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:12,171
why?
No,

2767
02:04:12,171 --> 02:04:14,930
no foods not bad for you.
Well this food is bad for you.

2768
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:15,651
Oh yeah.
Okay.

2769
02:04:15,651 --> 02:04:17,660
It is.
But like the salads.

2770
02:04:17,661 --> 02:04:19,280
Good for you.
Like that's food too.

2771
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:21,170
And that's the problem with drugs.
Drugs,

2772
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:25,220
the word drugs applies to things that
are highly beneficial.

2773
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:26,630
That's right.
It's just,

2774
02:04:26,631 --> 02:04:27,111
you know,
in,

2775
02:04:27,111 --> 02:04:30,320
in a land,
I get why they need to tell her that

2776
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:34,280
that company line.
But I do get it because again,

2777
02:04:34,281 --> 02:04:35,840
it's disempowering in a way,
isn't it?

2778
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:38,070
Because it's,
you're treating everybody as

2779
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,980
if you are the weakest possible
examples.

2780
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:41,551
It.
Look man,

2781
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:43,500
I'm not,
I'm not disagreeing with you at all,

2782
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:48,030
but I'm just saying I get it because it
does work.

2783
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:50,100
Right.
That's all I can say about it and I

2784
02:04:50,101 --> 02:04:52,350
don't disagree with I'm,
I'm kind of wishy washy about it,

2785
02:04:52,351 --> 02:04:54,900
but it works.
I just have a hard line.

2786
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,430
I have seen people's lives who you just
went,

2787
02:04:57,450 --> 02:04:58,080
you know,
the,

2788
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:59,460
the doldrums,
the,

2789
02:04:59,550 --> 02:05:00,720
you know,
the disinfect,

2790
02:05:00,721 --> 02:05:02,430
I mean,
left for dead,

2791
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:06,420
get their life saved and have really
great productive,

2792
02:05:06,421 --> 02:05:08,910
amazing life today.
And it's a really beautiful,

2793
02:05:08,911 --> 02:05:10,790
cool thing to see.
But this all sides,

2794
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:11,470
you know,
we,

2795
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:15,150
we have to come to the realization that
everyone's different.

2796
02:05:15,151 --> 02:05:16,200
Biological.
Yes.

2797
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:17,640
That,
that's why that that's the point.

2798
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:20,850
Everybody's wired differently.
There is no one size fits all thing.

2799
02:05:20,851 --> 02:05:22,500
And,
and now what we're seeing with ibogaine

2800
02:05:22,501 --> 02:05:24,060
treatment,
that map system,

2801
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:24,903
oh my god.

2802
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:26,070
So,
so cool.

2803
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:27,000
Really,
really,

2804
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:28,230
really promising.
And so,

2805
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:31,830
you know,
I just encourage everybody to find their

2806
02:05:31,831 --> 02:05:34,020
own dharma,
find their own path and you kind of make

2807
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,220
what works for you.
You know,

2808
02:05:35,221 --> 02:05:39,420
there's no prescribed method for
spiritual awakening or life saving or

2809
02:05:39,421 --> 02:05:40,380
life changing,
you know,

2810
02:05:40,381 --> 02:05:42,120
you just have to,
you know,

2811
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:43,860
balance it correctly.
So listen to your heart,

2812
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:45,660
what is your life like?
Like what do you,

2813
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:48,360
what do you do with your time?
What do you do for money?

2814
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:51,080
I do a few things.
I am.

2815
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:55,230
My life is kind of split into two things
I have in my podcast.

2816
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:57,870
What is that called again?
It's all happening.

2817
02:05:58,110 --> 02:05:59,210
It's all happening.
Yeah.

2818
02:05:59,410 --> 02:06:01,800
Um,
and so I do that.

2819
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:04,920
I'm,
I'm actually starting another podcast.

2820
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:07,050
I'm going to be hosting the maps
podcast.

2821
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:08,160
Oh really?
Oh,

2822
02:06:08,161 --> 02:06:11,070
that's awesome.
So maps is going to help them get off

2823
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:12,900
the ground and host it and start that.

2824
02:06:12,990 --> 02:06:14,850
Um,
so,

2825
02:06:14,851 --> 02:06:16,080
you know,
I kind of do that.

2826
02:06:16,081 --> 02:06:19,560
I can speak or you know,
at festivals and kind of teach,

2827
02:06:19,670 --> 02:06:20,490
you know,
some,

2828
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:22,680
some spiritual stuff and kind of do
that.

2829
02:06:22,681 --> 02:06:24,390
Right.
I've been working on the book,

2830
02:06:24,391 --> 02:06:28,980
but the other half of my life,
I'm kind of before I had my own little

2831
02:06:28,981 --> 02:06:31,890
spiritual awakening.
I was a technology consultant in the

2832
02:06:31,891 --> 02:06:35,700
branding consultant and worked in
digital marketing and at a lot of ad

2833
02:06:35,701 --> 02:06:39,180
agencies and stuff and they'd kind of a
nine to five corporate life,

2834
02:06:39,181 --> 02:06:40,350
which I,
I've ditched.

2835
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:43,050
But um,
I still keep some clients as kind of a

2836
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:45,300
day job sort of thing,
which is of fun.

2837
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:46,560
That's interesting.
So like what,

2838
02:06:46,610 --> 02:06:50,070
what does that entail as far as anything
that is,

2839
02:06:50,071 --> 02:06:50,521
if,
you know,

2840
02:06:50,521 --> 02:06:55,521
if a brand or an entity or a film or a
music client,

2841
02:06:55,621 --> 02:06:59,100
anybody wants to come to me and sort of
define their internet strategy,

2842
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:02,020
how they want to behave online,
um,

2843
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:06,570
whether that's just something as mundane
as having a new website to coming up

2844
02:07:06,571 --> 02:07:10,320
with a complete communication message
about how they want to market their,

2845
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,350
their thing.
So I kind of do that too.

2846
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:18,000
So I divide my time sort of 50 slash 50
between my stuff and then other

2847
02:07:18,001 --> 02:07:20,280
people's.
And when is this map's podcast launch?

2848
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:21,300

Oh,

2849

amazing guests.
