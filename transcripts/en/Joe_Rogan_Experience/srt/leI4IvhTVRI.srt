1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,420
Okay,

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,790
real good experience.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,610
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,880
Roseanne Barr.
So bad ass.

5
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:22,360
We had to stop this podcast.
Really?

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,840
We to start early.
We couldn't,

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,390
we couldn't even wait till three.
We had to get it rocking.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,910
She came here from a volcano.
Ladies,

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,960
gentlemen,
she lives on a volcano in the middle of 

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:33,960
the ocean.
That's as gangster as it gets.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,720
You and Terence Mckenna,
do you know he was.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,080
Terence Mckenna was this crazy 
psychedelic guy who lived on the big 

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,921
island.
He had this giant property and the big 

14
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:45,921
island where he grew all these 
psychedelic plants.

15
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,510
Most of them were actually legal to grow
because,

16
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:47,940
uh,
you know,

17
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,650
the government didn't know about quite a
few of them.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,060
You never heard of Terence Mckenna know.
So keep going.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,990
I will,
uh,

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,470
give you a lot of stuff before you leave
that tunes into this guy.

21
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,540
But he was,
um,

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,180
this sort of psychedelic bard.
That's the best way to describe it.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Just a really good speaker who had a 
deep understanding of psychedelics and 

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,711
of,
of botany and the biology of these 

25
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:15,951
plants.
And he also had some crazy theories 

26
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,411
about human beings.
And evolution and his biggest one was 

27
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,291
called the stoned ape theory.
Now I know that theory,

28
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:27,261
but I didn't know it was from that guy 
on Mckenna and he lived out the last 

29
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:32,631
part of his life on the big island.
He had this cool compound and used to 

30
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:33,590
bring people up there and do Iowasca 
with them.

31
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,650
Just those books.
That's like the third time I've heard 

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,571
about that IOWASCA.
That's only the third time you've heard 

33
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:44,511
it on the big island in the last little 
while talking about this spreading 

34
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:50,571
everywhere now.
But I think Mckenna is a big reason why 

35
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:51,100
it spread all around Hawaii.
You know,

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,480
he came to Hawaii,
I forget what year,

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,240
got some property and built a house out 
there on Mauna Loa.

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,720
In Kona.
Kona.

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,100
Yeah.
He had like a complete self sufficient 

40
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,891
system up there,
like collecting rain water and they're 

41
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:13,320
all crazy up there and they're the most 
genius genius inventors.

42
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,770
They were just incredible over there.
The stuff they've done is like 

43
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,080
incredible looking there.
So there's like,

44
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,060
you know,
so futuristic in their design.

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,440
It blows my mind.
Their designs are like space,

46
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,290
like,
well that's where the,

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,870
the observatory is to Keck observatory.
So there's a bunch of jeans.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,210
Did you go up there?

49
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,570
How,
how's it haunted?

50
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,340
In what way?
Oh No,

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,030
no,
no,

52
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,800
no,
no,

53
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,810
no.
That whole Mana,

54
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,370
Mana,
k a mountain,

55
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,680
you know,
that's a holy mountain,

56
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,490
you know,
Hawaiian.

57
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,520
But where they were born out of is that 
mountain Monica.

58
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,300
So where they were born,
they were born.

59
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,590
Yeah.
Like they,

60
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,090
there,
they came on boats,

61
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,600
didn't they?

62
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,100
Well,
yeah,

63
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,300
in the more kaizens yeah.
But it's like all one big Ole mindmeld 

64
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,570
thing,
but the native Hawaiian people who like,

65
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,870
I don't know how they got there,
some say they came on those boats and 

66
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:27,620
uh,
but they have their,

67
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,670
their myths and their very connected to 
that piece of ground and they are very 

68
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:34,240
connected to,
you know,

69
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,160
Monica the mountain and uh,
you know,

70
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:39,860
they still have their same mythology and
everything,

71
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:44,861
you know.
So I love to listen to what they say 

72
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:44,970
about,
um,

73
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,080
you know,
the island and Gmos and power and 

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,110
there's some interesting thinkers.

75
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,120
What's one of the last free place is 
really,

76
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:54,370
if you stop and think about it,
it's,

77
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,400
it's,
it's America,

78
00:03:55,401 --> 00:04:00,401
but it's not really,
it's five hours away by plane and it's 

79
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,220
incredible paradise as far as like 
nature.

80
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,900
You know what?
All of the islands,

81
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,640
Maui,
the big island,

82
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:09,641
all of them,
they're just incredibly fascinating and 

83
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:09,641
gorgeous and beautiful and,

84
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,220
but all that.
Everybody says all that,

85
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,920
you know,
that's one way of putting it I guess.

86
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,880
But to me it's like whoa.
It grabbed me in the naval,

87
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,240
grabbed you in the naval lab,
my navel and we're not let.

88
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,830
We're not cease to grab my navel.

89
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,110
That's one of your shockers,
right?

90
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,330
Isn't it supposed to be.
Naval is one of them.

91
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,700
There's something,
there's something around there that it's

92
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:32,950
like a magnet thing.
It's to,

93
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,590
to a certain place on earth.
I don't know.

94
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,380
And it's like an energy lay lance and 
you know,

95
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,300
you know,
I,

96
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,090
you know what I mean?

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,550
I do.
I've written some of my best things ever

98
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,220
in Hawaii on vacation where I don't 
usually write.

99
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,610
Yeah,

100
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,110
I can right there.
That's why I like it there because I can

101
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:52,230
really right there.
It's like your head is clear and,

102
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,150
and your,
you got your,

103
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,700
you have your,
your creative idea and you can carry it 

104
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,290
out and finish it.
I can't never finish it,

105
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:05,070
you know,
but I can finish things there

106
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,620
while you are more at peace.
There are things because because 

107
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,071
everyone sort of knows it's isolating.
You also know that you really are on a 

108
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:14,800
volcano.
This beautiful natural volcano.

109
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Well,
I went there because they got a goddess 

110
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,770
named Pele and that's why the last place
on earth where there's like a,

111
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:26,771
you know,
a goddess so that it is active in 

112
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,921
people's minds and act also active 
inside a volcano might erupt at any 

113
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:31,190
time,
which is,

114
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,410
you know,
um,

115
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,920
what happens,
you know,

116
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,870
it's very sufi adjust,
you know what I mean?

117
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,310
Because it's like somewhere there is 
that which occurred that which,

118
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,550
uh,
is thought before it occurs.

119
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,280
You know what I mean?
And I really feel that they are,

120
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,180
that you get your,
you get your thinking,

121
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,860
um,
all lined up,

122
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:56,861
right?
And it's like you're connected to the 

123
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:59,650
earth.
They're like me trying to my nuts out 

124
00:05:59,650 --> 00:05:59,650
there,
joe.

125
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,630
That's been the fucking mindblower.
Macadamias.

126
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,570
Thanks.
Yeah.

127
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,020
You're growing them,
right?

128
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:05,490
You have like a plantation or something

129
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,770
on them.
The trees are grown up.

130
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,270
I just pick them up,
but I try to fertilize my trees and get 

131
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:18,351
it so that you can perfect the net and 
this year was quite a good harvest and 

132
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,090
uh,
these debts are like,

133
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:24,750
they're not like nobody else.
They're not like any other nuts.

134
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,130
I'm serious.

135
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,060
I believe you.
I think you were actually a part of it.

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,700
I bet you affect it just,
just in that way

137
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,470
do ship for it.
But it was like owned by the Dole 

138
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,080
Pineapple,
you know about it.

139
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,410
They own the entire,
like an island of Lanai,

140
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:42,800
didn't they?

141
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,910
Oh yeah,
yeah,

142
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,320
yeah.
At one point in time at least.

143
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,830
Yeah.
Them and the University of Hawaii,

144
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,180
they're all hooked up,
you know,

145
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,040
and they do do your genetic modification
studies and such,

146
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,790
which is very interesting to me of how,
how they do all that and then create a 

147
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,380
pineapple that has lower acidity and 
stuff like that.

148
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,610
I think that's interesting.

149
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,900
It's very interesting,
it's spooky and it's interesting at the 

150
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,181
same time because it the implications of
genetically modifying plants or are 

151
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:15,140
huge,
they're very profound and they shouldn't

152
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:18,380
just affect the people that are creating
them and putting them out there.

153
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:20,910
They're really worldwide questions and 
when,

154
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,940
when you have people that are just 
getting away with doing genetic 

155
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,081
modifications on plants,
not really sure of the longterm 

156
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,960
ramifications to the environment,
to bs too.

157
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,260
There's a host of different things that 
are affected by these things.

158
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,900
These things.

159
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,610
Well,
I thought that I got.

160
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,620
I thought I did a pretty good checkmate 
on on Monsanto,

161
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,680
which I called him once eight and I 
thought I got them in a choke hold like 

162
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,110
that bitch.
You're talking about that fighting Ronda

163
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,310
Rousey.
Nothing compared to me.

164
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,050
Wow.
How dare I tell you?

165
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:53,960
I put them in quite a nice headlock over
there.

166
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,580
What were they trying to do?
Well,

167
00:07:55,581 --> 00:08:00,581
they were trying to pass a law or to get
rid of a law which took a lot of work 

168
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,910
getting there to make law,
which was to,

169
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,340
you know,
that the people,

170
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:09,341
they're not want the GMO studies to 
continue on the island and uh,

171
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,290
you know,
so it was like you got to vote yes,

172
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,370
but it really means now,
and I mean it was like layer after layer

173
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,910
of ridiculousness to protect public 
health and home.

174
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,700
So I just started studying it and I 
realized that there they,

175
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,030
they kept on doing that fake science 
thing that they do,

176
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,880
but it's like,
hey,

177
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,980
science last more than 90 days.
Genetic studies,

178
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,820
proper scientific genetic studies they 
have follow through and they also have a

179
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:47,801
control group and he don't,
you come to a conclusion,

180
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,920
you don't stop studying after 90 days.
And then like actually like pay 

181
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,100
lobbyists to pass a law saying you only 
have to do

182
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,080
90 days.
I mean gas,

183
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,540
that's Satan,
that's friggin crazy ass.

184
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,960
Satan.

185
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,890
It's money.
It's pure money.

186
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,190
People wanting money over humanity.
People wanting money over the 

187
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,540
possibility of damage.
You know,

188
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,580
we got to be really careful with nature,
it's just there's been a million 

189
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,880
diseases that have occurred throughout 
the history of people and they come from

190
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:20,881
a variety of reasons that come from a 
variety of sources that come from all 

191
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:22,630
sorts of different contagions.
But we can create shit.

192
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,200
We could accidentally fuck up and create
something horrible and we could also,

193
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,750
if we haven't already,

194
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,840
fucking atomic weaponry,
there's the biggest fucking mistake 

195
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,501
anybody's ever heard of and make it and 
then they make it and then give every 

196
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,630
everybody 50 or 60 of them.
Fuck,

197
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,530
you know,
I mean,

198
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,560
the truth is that horrifying truth of my
opinion.

199
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Why I don't go to parties because I do 
bump people out of certain fucking 

200
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:51,390
point,
you know,

201
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,820
I do because it's like,
it,

202
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:56,040
it,
it's not a popular thing to say.

203
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,870
It's all fucking over.

204
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,260
It's totally over.
It's too late to a human beings have 

205
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,230
ruined the planet.
Fuck yeah.

206
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,550
See,
I'm not convinced.

207
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,150
I think we've definitely fucked a lot of
things up and there's definitely a lot 

208
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,550
of hubris going on and there's a lot of 
scary shit going on.

209
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:14,600
Like Fukushima,
Fukushima is bad and it started at the,

210
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,610
they just had a new um,
studies showing that a lot of radiation 

211
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,030
started to reach San Francisco,
you know,

212
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,860
they've found a three percent increase 
in some of the tune of the radiation and

213
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:24,240
tuna.
It's scary shit,

214
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,640
but there's also people eat fish out of 
there and yeah,

215
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,470
I don't know who they are,
but I think

216
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,980
we're all poison.
Banged out over.

217
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,460
Everything's fucking rotten.
Poison.

218
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,610
Fucking it's all dead.
Is Dead.

219
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,170
Isn't fucking doornail and too 
motherfucker.

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,240
It's not.
It's time to let that thing go really 

221
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,230
serious.
It's time to get real and do what 

222
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,760
fucking needs to be done.
What needs to be done?

223
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,980
Well,
you got you gotTa fucking get busy.

224
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:55,930
I've trying to turn it back so you've 
got to keep on rolling over yet it's not

225
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,720
going to get better by you mean 
capitalist society,

226
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:01,030
corporations,
people destroying the earth,

227
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,240
polluting all that shit.
Nuclear waste.

228
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,700
Is that what you're saying?
By Roll it back?

229
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,230
Oh,
everything that's lemming.

230
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,990
It's time for months.
Say,

231
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:15,230
tend to become of used to the human 
race.

232
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:20,231
That's just my opinion.
They've got to come up with some kind 

233
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:20,480
of.
They're going to do genetic studies.

234
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,950
Okay,
get rid of that.

235
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,250
Get rid of that one.
[inaudible],

236
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,300
come up with some kind of an implant for
people's teeth are brain that blocks 

237
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:36,671
that horrendous lemming fucking impulse.
Do fucking humanity of favor and 

238
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:42,851
figuring out how we're supposed to get 
rid of that shit that we keep going 

239
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:45,821
along with what's killing us because 
we're too fucking confused to know what 

240
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,060
the fuck is really good.

241
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,160
Real,
isn't it?

242
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:51,490
Just that there's just too much to be 
paying attention to their own lives.

243
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,650
They have their own problems,
their own bills on family,

244
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:53,980
and

245
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
then each try paying attention to global
issues like genetically modified foods 

246
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,301
and farmers suing all across the world.
The farmers in Brazil recently,

247
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:07,390
one billions of dollars from Monsanto 
farm is in India.

248
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,720
Commit suicide on an almost daily basis.
I mean they have.

249
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,780
They have farmers in India that are 
committing suicide left and right 

250
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,470
because of the debt that they get into 
these crazy deals.

251
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,490
Bullshit.
It's all been pyramid.

252
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,280
They can't get out of it and they can't 
afford it,

253
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,500
and that the whole thing is just a 
disaster.

254
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:28,501
It's a disaster.
It's a disaster that clearly has its 

255
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:28,501
roots in money.
I mean,

256
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:29,320
it's,
it's just about heres the roads.

257
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,500
They're getting a payoff for the 
different various ways that people can 

258
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,211
get killed.
They're getting fucking insurance pay 

259
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,430
off for killing people.
Uh,

260
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,470
you know,
and taking bets on how long it'll take 

261
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,470
for them to die.

262
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,470
But on the other side,
on the other hand,

263
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,121
I think like the idea of genetically 
modifying food in order to help people 

264
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:54,590
nutritious food like golden rice and 
there's been a bunch of innovation as 

265
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:54,590
far as.
Absolutely.

266
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,780
I think that there's a lot of beauty in 
the science behind it,

267
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,100
but I think we're going to be really,
really,

268
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:04,101
really fucking careful when you're 
playing around with nature to the money 

269
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:04,770
part is disgusting.
The pollution of the environment.

270
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:06,900
Disgusting.
But when you started about talking about

271
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:10,440
declining bee populations due to the 
pesticides they using in their plants,

272
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,710
it's scary shit because if the bees go,
there's a chain reaction to this whole 

273
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,930
thing.
We might not like the end result of it.

274
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,520
You got it.

275
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,610
Read up on that be shit.
That's.

276
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,890
That's a really interesting micro world 
stuff,

277
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,100
but it's like all the stop.
The African Queens,

278
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,460
the invading African queens.
Have you ever gone on there?

279
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:30,020
Read them

280
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,070
kind of language.
That was like really?

281
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,550
Yeah.
No,

282
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,920
they were definitely afraid of African 
killer bees.

283
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,240
They're afraid of that.
That's not why they're killing these 

284
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,231
fucking piece.
They're killing these bees because the 

285
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:42,231
pesticides are given them.
Just killed everything.

286
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:42,560
Not only that,
there.

287
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,900
There's a lot of patients are in 
business together.

288
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,910
Work on both side of the street.
You think they're actively trying to 

289
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,910
kill babies.
I think it's just a side effect.

290
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,310
Your solutions

291
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,480
kill a whole populations for a fucking 
kick back.

292
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,240
Yeah.

293
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,720
You think they're actively trying to 
kill whole populations of bees,

294
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,450
of humans,
of humans,

295
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,480
of life mentality.
I don't think that.

296
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,500
I think they're just trying to profit.
I'm very positive.

297
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,190
See,
I told you guys bomber,

298
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,990
you just very strong and very 
opinionated and it's all bullshit

299
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,750
and people better,
you know,

300
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,820
figure out how to make everything work 
for people.

301
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,210
And everything could really work for all
people.

302
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,400
All the mechanism is in place.
It's just like the,

303
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,890
the,
the crazy Trans Trans and bots that seat

304
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,040
that are seated in,
in those positions of power.

305
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,960
They're not for like,
you know,

306
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,630
humanity.
Yeah.

307
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,040
Yeah.
I agree.

308
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,950
I hundred percent agree.
It does.

309
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:44,951
Uh,
the real problem is the idea of a 

310
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:44,951
corporation itself where you value the 
bottom line,

311
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:48,861
the numbers over the humans that work 
there over the humans you affect with 

312
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:52,701
your work and because you can do it like
that because you can send to place and 

313
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:52,701
shoot

314
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:57,070
mrs out of the sky because you can just 
sort of does choose to fuck over some 

315
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,420
country that you never have to visit and
take,

316
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
take away a lot of their natural 
resources and make them,

317
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,190
force them into using your product 
because you have deals with politicians 

318
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,110
and kings and monarchs there.
You know,

319
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,250
just because you could do that doesn't 
mean that's the way you're supposed to 

320
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,281
be living your life.
You have one life here and you could 

321
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,670
choose to be an evil fuck.
Or you can choose to be a good person.

322
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,890
I always try to appeal to them to go,
you know,

323
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:21,470
you could rejoin the human race at any 
point.

324
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,790
They all could.
They could.

325
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,310
They could like actually like make 
stuff,

326
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:27,020
all that technology,
all that.

327
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,120
Everything that it took to create the 
science,

328
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,170
the actual science of like a increasing 
food for people and all and like a 

329
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,900
desalinization of water and all these 
things that are so possible.

330
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,290
Yeah.
Just wasn't for just a few greedy Fox 

331
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,290
and they're and they're trons.

332
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Absolutely.
I've always said that if you could just 

333
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,551
take the amount of money that the United
States gave to Halliburton to rebuild 

334
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:58,770
Iraq after we destroyed it and put that 
money in the inner cities in America and

335
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:01,290
not have the ward not destroy anything 
in the first place,

336
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:06,291
the amount of positive work that could 
have been done and the same amount of 

337
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:06,620
contracts could have been dealt out.
We could.

338
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,230
We could have all easily convinced the 
money that's been spent.

339
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,870
It could effect on work.
It still can.

340
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,330
I think we have a better chance today 
than ever before.

341
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,420
I think because today you have 
inflammation,

342
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,540
you have information.
It's being distributed in a way that no 

343
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:26,540
one can stop.
You can't stop so far,

344
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,830
but they stopped it.
It doesn't matter if the people that are

345
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,620
interested,
they can.

346
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,970
They are not big enough.
There's not enough of them that would 

347
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:34,970
agree with that because they would turn 
against each other.

348
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,380
It's not like there's a cabal of three 
dudes that have ultimate power.

349
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,960
There's thousands and thousands of 
people that are making decisions.

350
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:44,961
Whether or not this gets censored,
that gets censored and they're in 

351
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,370
cahoots against each other.
That's a problem by the FBI and the CIA.

352
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,870
The reason why portray us got kicked 
removed from office is the CIA was being

353
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:55,390
spied on by the fucking FBI.
They can't even.

354
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,440
That's what all NSA spying on each 
other.

355
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,720
For sure.
Find out if he knows the shit.

356
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:05,721
I Bet Poland exactly.
We're caught up kind of runs on black 

357
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:05,721
male like,
okay,

358
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:10,710
what is like?
They fucking think they're like James 

359
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,680
Bond or something,
but it's all like they all have to be 

360
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:13,840
dirty in order to blackmail the other 
side.

361
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,230
They're all fun.
Crux,

362
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,040
every goddamn blast.
Fucking one of them will.

363
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,400
There's certainly quite a few of them 
that are crooks and inside the system,

364
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,070
I don't know any of them,
I don't know them,

365
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,940
so I don't know if they're crooks are 
not crooks,

366
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:29,480
but I think if you were growing up in 
that system,

367
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,510
people imitate their atmosphere,
you get caught up in that wacky system 

368
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,000
and that becomes your reality and you 
think you're doing it,

369
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,850
you know,
also the side effects.

370
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,840
No,
I didn't see that.

371
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,340
I did what that insane.

372
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,470
Yeah.
Well isn't it?

373
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,370
That's uh,
that's,

374
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,400
that's like,

375
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,730
okay.

376
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,020
That was like fucking an unreal.

377
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,450
But that's what,
that's what they,

378
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,150
they've just gone crazy ended jackal 
land.

379
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:57,090
They left a human race.
So it's people trying to do something,

380
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,020
you know,
they try to,

381
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:01,860
when they try to succeed,
they tried to get past this marker.

382
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,400
They have a marker of 10 million.
They want to get to 100.

383
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,190
You want to get to a billion like that.
They keep snorting coke to keep it up.

384
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:13,191
You know,
you ain't got to go farther and farther 

385
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:13,191
when the stock market.
Well,

386
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,130
don't be telling them about adderall 
because I got on adderall and it's the 

387
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,031
best fucking thing.
Not saying there's anything wrong with 

388
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:23,031
it.
I have.

389
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:23,031
My good friend is on a.
He a,

390
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:24,570
a patch that he keeps on his leg.
PROZAC.

391
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,850
Yeah.
It's got a PROZAC patch.

392
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,320
Yeah,
there's,

393
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,090
yeah,
exactly.

394
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,560
Taking the adderall but they won't 
enter.

395
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,120
You can't get.
I asked what I'd love from us taking the

396
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:36,970
adderall,
but uh,

397
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
the dropoff at the end of the day was 
too much for them.

398
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:44,001
It was really starting to drive him 
crazy because he would feel great 

399
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:44,001
throughout the day and be very 
productive.

400
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:47,840
And then you'd have this big dropoff 
well that's when you start your 

401
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,570
drinking.
That's cocktail hour.

402
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,070
I'm not saying there's anything wrong 
with adderall,

403
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:55,071
but I am saying a lot of people that are
getting a lot of shit done or taken 

404
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:55,071
adderall.
No,

405
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,010
she had cleaned out.
Listen,

406
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,970
I am sad.

407
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,490
I just cleaned out my closet,
which I have never done in my whole 

408
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,500
fucking life because I can't focus to do
that,

409
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:08,090
you know?
But like I said,

410
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,020
fuck it.
I'm,

411
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,080
I might add plenty of fucking closet.
I'm have shared in there from 25 fucking

412
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,830
years that I was afraid to throw out.
I counted.

413
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,840
I had something like 1700 black plain 
black tee shirts.

414
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,490
Wow.
How did you count those all?

415
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:31,110
I woulda gave up after the first couple 
of hundred

416
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,930
because I was donating them.
Wow.

417
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,100
That's incredible.
Wow.

418
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,460
I'm,
I'm not gonna do that again.

419
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,090
That's when I.
That was pre adderall behavior.

420
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,630
That was pre adderall.
Adderall made me see.

421
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,140
Oh Shit.
I had enough fucking black tee shirt.

422
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,200
So adderall gave you clarity on that 
because my kids are trying to get me off

423
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:01,710
and why are you like math?

424
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,650
My fucking kids like that.
I put through Rehab.

425
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,270
He shared about my fucking.
I'll tell me.

426
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,250
He's like,
no,

427
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,270
it's not like I've never done math 
except for,

428
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,340
you know,
two times I was married to Tom Arnold.

429
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,470
But aside from that,
you know,

430
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:18,720
I've never,
I would never get into math.

431
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,800
I think it's nothing like adderall.

432
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,400
I think they've got it down to where 
it's very effective for a lot of people.

433
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,620
I'll tell you one thing,
it's real effective because I got the 

434
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,621
back and forth of everything,
two way mirror thing going on all the 

435
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:37,000
time.
It made me.

436
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,180
I used to bite my nails so bad,
you know,

437
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
like a down to nothing because my dad,
he did it too.

438
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,160
And uh,
and uh,

439
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,050
uh,
but I quit for a long time.

440
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,580
Then I went on adderall and um,
I started biting my nails and then I had

441
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:56,581
to keep it down to only two nails that I
could allow myself to buy it only tune,

442
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,850
but it perfected my fucking nail biting

443
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,350
because there's like no nail left at all
at all.

444
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,330
They're really good at it.
So good at it now.

445
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,940
But you give yourself two nails.
Do you have specific nails?

446
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,740
Yeah,
these two are my biters.

447
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,420
So adderall let you save your other 
eight fingers essentially.

448
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,980
But it kind of forced me to do these two
though.

449
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,270
So it's got its good and bad,
but I have clean closets

450
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,230
and you know,

451
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,070
to write scripts I was able to fly a 
fucking focus software.

452
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,760
Yeah,
that adderall stuff.

453
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,080
Did you know Robert Schimmel?
I did know Robert Shaw,

454
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:44,110
I'm a great guy

455
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,080
who's a really,
really,

456
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,400
really good guy.
Very,

457
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:49,140
very funny guy.
Very good guy.

458
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,590
He was so funny.
He had a heart condition and when he had

459
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:54,990
his heart condition,
when he was recovering from it,

460
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,650
he accidentally took adderall and called
his doctor up.

461
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,140
I guess it was somebody else's and he 
mistook the bottle,

462
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:03,150
wasn't paying attention and took the 
wrong medication.

463
00:22:03,151 --> 00:22:06,840
It took someone else's medication and so
he calls his doctor up in a panic.

464
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,010
Hey,
I fucked up.

465
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:09,420
I thought it was taking my heart 
medication.

466
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:11,850
I took adderall.
What am I gonna be okay,

467
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Doctor.
Just like don't worry about it was the 

468
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:16,860
dosage.
He tells me the dosage,

469
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:16,860
you're gonna be fine.
He goes,

470
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,260
just prepare to get a lot of shit done.
Robert said,

471
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,440
he goes,
I organize my notes in a way I've never 

472
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,190
done before when over stacks of paper 
and wrote them all down into categories.

473
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,060
Totally fucked

474
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,840
I guess.
I mean,

475
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:32,841
it's so good like you can,
you can write a script instead of like 

476
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:36,830
getting 50 ideas on page 10 and 10 
scripts and then just fucking throwing 

477
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,880
them all in the garbage,
you know,

478
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,360
just the obsessive thing.
You can focus it so that it,

479
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,940
it's uh,
you know,

480
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,310
constructive.

481
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,680
I've heard people say that it doesn't 
make you very creative that it makes you

482
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:55,681
get work done,
but it's more like busy work done or 

483
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:55,681
things not creative.
Things like that.

484
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:56,980
Writing on it was not good.

485
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,060
This is just obviously a secondhand,
but that could be,

486
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,820
I don't know.
It could be.

487
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:10,180
Yeah.
I can never say because things affect 

488
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,221
people differently anyway.
Like I know people that smoke pot and 

489
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:15,250
they want to go work out and I didn't 
know people that smoke pot and they 

490
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:15,250
don't want to do anything,
you know,

491
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,271
and I don't know what that is.
They get smoked the same pod and they 

492
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:22,001
have the one person has a sense of 
adventure and wants to put boots on and 

493
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,521
go to the top of a mountain and the 
other person doesn't want to do a thing 

494
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:24,521
ever.
They want to play video games.

495
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:26,290
It's who knows,
you know,

496
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,060
neural pathways.
They're all different.

497
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,050
We're so different.
People seek some relief.

498
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:34,080
And I,
I,

499
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,960
you know,
I'm sure we agree.

500
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:36,380
They,
they,

501
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,680
uh,
they should have the right to,

502
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,880
to the relief that they seek,
uh,

503
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,730
you know,
uh,

504
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:46,210
everybody,
they should just legalize pot and like 

505
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:46,210
then I think all the troubles

506
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,660
would end pot and ham.

507
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,940
I really agree with you 100 percent.
I think that especially people started 

508
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:52,940
eating it,
they started eating,

509
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,280
getting that self objective,
self analytical experience,

510
00:23:56,281 --> 00:24:01,281
really intense experiences.
People will be a lot less prone to 

511
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,310
continue a lot of their shitty behavior 
that I does.

512
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:05,560
Mckenna's theory of evolution in the 
first theory.

513
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Yeah.
It was all about psilocybin mushrooms 

514
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,550
and the rain forests of Africa,
how the rain forest has had receded into

515
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:15,120
grasslands and all this is proved by 
climatological studies,

516
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,870
core samples and stuff like that.
The time has been debated,

517
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:23,871
but essentially what happened was the 
rainforest receded monkeys came down 

518
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:27,381
from the trees and started experimenting
with different food sources and one of 

519
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:27,381
them was the mushrooms growing on 
calpads.

520
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:32,270
Oh yeah.
I've heard that you started eating 

521
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,270
psilocybin mushrooms and started having 
these intense ideas.

522
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,870
I mean,
it only makes sense if we get intense 

523
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,220
ideas from them and we're having 
advanced brain and a monkey gets intense

524
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,450
and experiences from.

525
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,170
They obviously have intelligent brains 
mean.

526
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,010
We've seen chimps do a lot of really 
crazy creative things.

527
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,640
We know that the act impacts.
We only hunt in packs were talking about

528
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:51,720
like lower hominids getting a dose of 
psilocybin mushrooms on a daily basis.

529
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,450
Of course it's going to have a crazy 
effect on their evolution.

530
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,770
Of course it's.
That's a,

531
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,380
that's a big factor.
It's a big factor in,

532
00:24:58,381 --> 00:24:59,970
in terms of thinking,
you know,

533
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,480
I and I completely agree with you that 
and Hampton,

534
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,530
all these different things.
If they were made available,

535
00:25:04,531 --> 00:25:09,531
I think we are lacking in self analysis 
and we're lacking as a society and our 

536
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:15,771
feeling of being responsible for the 
actions of the group and those are two 

537
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:15,771
things that you feel.

538
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:22,250
It's so arrogant too because it's like 
we just like ignore what everything 

539
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:24,450
means to other people.
We,

540
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,480
we don't want to know what anything 
means to other people.

541
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,990
We don't care as long as we can make 
money,

542
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,180
like if you're going to go to the rain 
forest and chopped down these people,

543
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:38,800
sacred trees and villages and force them
to work in factories instead,

544
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,600
if they'll.
If they're willing to do it,

545
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,610
then we're going to get them to do it 
because we want those trees.

546
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:47,611
When we want that oil and whatever the 
fuck else is there that we can make 

547
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:51,060
medicine out of mean what they're doing 
is just stealing resources and we're 

548
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
letting them.
We're letting them say,

549
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:52,870
oh,
this stuff,

550
00:25:52,871 --> 00:25:53,860
yeah,
they don't live here.

551
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:58,861
This is so what they've been in.
These people have been there for 

552
00:25:58,861 --> 00:25:58,861
thousands of years and say anybody who 
has eminent domain,

553
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:01,390
tribal rights,
that's what they're really after.

554
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:06,391
It's crazy.
They're trying to get rid of that 

555
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:06,391
separate.
All people from like from nature.

556
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,400
You can't stop people from having the 
ability to live a natural life just 

557
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,631
because you have guns just because you 
have tanks that stealing and if we're 

558
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:15,760
going to just let people steal shit.

559
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,500
If these people were there in the middle
of the Amazon,

560
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,960
that's their fucking home.
That's their home.

561
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,030
You have to be able to take into 
context.

562
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:24,610
Their culture is culture of hunting and 
gathering.

563
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,620
They're living in these,
these cultures,

564
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:29,720
the same way they've been living in some
places like in the Congo and the in the,

565
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,560
in the Amazon thousands of years it had 
been untouched.

566
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,290
You can't do anything about that.
You got to leave that alone.

567
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,620
You know you have to because just as far
as like for the sake of our 

568
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:44,520
understanding of ourselves,
having like that with these ancient,

569
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,700
ancient untouched cultures is so 
important.

570
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,970
It's so fascinating.
We can learn so much about the origins 

571
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,421
of certain behaviors,
about group thinking when you were in 

572
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:59,421
small tribes that counter each other 
about how they dealt with injuries and 

573
00:26:59,421 --> 00:26:59,550
medicine.
I mean these are fascinating,

574
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:03,300
fascinating discoveries to be had and 
instead people just want money.

575
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,980
They just want to be able to chop the 
trees down.

576
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:09,981
Fuck these weird people,
take their shit and throw them in a 

577
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:09,981
cage.

578
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:10,970
You know,
capitalism is like that.

579
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:13,020
That's how it works.
Unless you know,

580
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,290
unless,
unless human beings would brains,

581
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,100
you know,
get it under control as a tool of people

582
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:24,670
and not its master,
it'll continue to go that way because it

583
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:29,671
requires that it requires gluttonous 
quarterly growth and there's nothing 

584
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:33,850
left but invest in people dying fast.

585
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,220
Yeah.
They don't want to maintain,

586
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,020
they want growth,
which is ridiculous.

587
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,090
Like at a certain point in time,
have everybody kept growing.

588
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,010
The world would be full.
Like there's,

589
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,040
there's no room,
there's no room for everybody to keep 

590
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,100
growing a business in that regard.
Like that being your primary goal.

591
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,960
Not to be profitable,
not to make money.

592
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,830
Well,
I think these guys are stupid.

593
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:55,570
Let me tell you why,
because it makes no sense to me because,

594
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,630
okay,
I accept that they're greedy fucking 

595
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,301
pigs and um,
I just think why can't they make that 

596
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:08,011
work for them and everyone else,
why can't they be a greedy fucking pig?

597
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,880
Because they're going to get like 10 
times the fucking pay off.

598
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,360
They will get even richer if they'll 
just listen to me make all the bats 

599
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,470
because like Wall Street and all that 
shit.

600
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:25,471
That's just going to the casino,
make all the bets about how fast you can

601
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:30,130
turn a place,
a green and sustainable,

602
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:32,860
and how fast could that happen.
A village,

603
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,280
how fast could that happen and you know,
they they could like use the same 

604
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:43,741
fucking ridiculous infrastructure that 
already exists to like make things 

605
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:49,201
better for everybody and could get the 
food to the hungry people because 

606
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,050
there's really.
That's all it is,

607
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:54,190
is the roads that get the food to the 
hungry people.

608
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,400
That's 90 percent of everybody who's 
dying is dying because of waste and 

609
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,120
stupidity.
Now,

610
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:06,121
if they fixed that,
they're going to get 10 times fucking 

611
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,421
richer,
but they're not greedy fucking pigs 

612
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:09,421
enough.
That's the problem.

613
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,790
All avenues as being a way to make 
money.

614
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,130
Even avenues that hurt people,
as long as they profit,

615
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,410
that's the real problem.
They're mad,

616
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,480
they're lacking in humanity and that's 
why when you talk about pot being what 

617
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,840
could fix everything or psychedelics 
being what could fix things,

618
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,380
that's the only thing that's going to 
bring humanity to a giant group.

619
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:31,381
Think that thinks that it's okay to be 
completely diffused of responsibilities 

620
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:35,431
because you're a part of some gigantic 
machine that apparently no one can 

621
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:38,491
control now,
so if you're a giant machine like 

622
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:40,741
Monsanto,
this has been fucking over farmers for 

623
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:43,021
100,000
years or however long they've been 

624
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:43,021
around for to that

625
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:47,040
to stop that whole thing.
They're going to have to get the whole 

626
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,290
team high on mushrooms now,
but it worked.

627
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,350
Did it?
Didn't you hear this that Monsanto said 

628
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,510
they were going to.
Now they're going into pot.

629
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,050
Did you not hear that?
They're fucking good.

630
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,130
They're changing their thing and and 
they have another name for it.

631
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,020
Center just or some shit.
You have another name for pot?

632
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,050
Our new company.
Yeah.

633
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,720
They're going to own the patent on 
pockets where it gets really creepy.

634
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:12,721
They tried to own patent on pigs.
They tried to own pigs because pigs.

635
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,230
I was totally involved in that argument.
I was wondering because I was like,

636
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,110
can you can,
can we create a kosher pig that.

637
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:26,210
That's an actual thing.
There was an actual studies about that 

638
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,970
idea of patenting and then owning a life
form is fucking ridiculous.

639
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,610
Kosher pig though.

640
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,000
I think it would be really cute.
It would be.

641
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,530
You'd have to.
Was Nicer,

642
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,960
nicer stuff would look better.
It wouldn't be clothing.

643
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,950
What would it be?
The genetically altered?

644
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,030
What would be the other options?
You want to keep it like they'd make a 

645
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,201
pig into a chow or something.
I guess like they made a fish out of a 

646
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:55,660
tomato,
you know that,

647
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:57,280
right?
I mean a tomato out of a fish.

648
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,410
They put fish genes in the tomato to 
make it shiny in the grocery store.

649
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:02,880
Yeah.
No,

650
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,440
they're doing a lot of weird shit like 
that.

651
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,360
They've always been doing that.
That's what I was saying about my farm,

652
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,720
that Dole pineapple that my farm is 
where they did a lot of shit like that 

653
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,630
and here it is.
Like I don't know how many generations 

654
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,330
later,
but my fucking nuts are like,

655
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,160
they're like walnuts.
I'm telling you.

656
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,900
You think it's because of the 
genetically modified dirt or something,

657
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:31,170
whatever these fucking things.
Three of them is a meal really?

658
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,230
Is the perfect protein.
How did you get involved in macadamia 

659
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,070
nuts?
How this whole thing gets started?

660
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,820
God,
well,

661
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:48,420
I tried to look for a school to put for 
my kid because my kid,

662
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,900
he's 18 now,
but he was little and he needed to go to

663
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:57,370
a school that had focused because I 
don't have any focus so I wasn't able to

664
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:01,960
teach him how to focus or else he was 
born that way or some shit.

665
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But uh,
I can't tell so I put them in that 

666
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,020
school.
So then I went out,

667
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,080
I went over and I found this school,
so I went over there and I bought this 

668
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,400
farm site unseen.
Really moved into it.

669
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,410
What island?
A big island.

670
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,240
So there was a really good school.
I knew it was elvis favorite island.

671
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,330
I went there.
And you know that that's where Elvis 

672
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:27,330
was.
That's where Elvis?

673
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,220
Yes.
That's the spot though.

674
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:32,000
If you've never been to the observatory 
up there.

675
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:32,630
No.

676
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,650
They said don't go up there.
No,

677
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,630
because it could erupt at any fucking 
time.

678
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,550
Really?
Yeah.

679
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,440
That an active,
active Montello is active,

680
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:45,440
right?
Monica Monica is active.

681
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Yeah.
I guess I think they give you a little 

682
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,031
bit of warning before it blows,
but a return and a I just returned in 

683
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,880
the corner in my car just as it happened
when it hit,

684
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,450
I know it.
I tweeted a picture today of a bridge 

685
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,740
falling apart of a,
a road actually falling apart.

686
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:05,900
Just some cracks in the road.
A landslide.

687
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:10,901
This gigantic.
That's one thing you do have to think 

688
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:10,901
about.
If you live in Hawaii,

689
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:11,900
do you have to think about the fact that
you're living on a volcano?

690
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,270
Do you know?
I'm not making this up.

691
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:20,271
You won't fucking believe this is the 
kind of shit the atms to me and I'm not 

692
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:20,340
making it up.
I believe you.

693
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,760
I was sitting at my desk here where I 
live,

694
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:24,930
you know,
in the,

695
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,830
in the marina

696
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,090
and uh,

697
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,960
I just hit send on something incendiary 
thing that I'd worked on all day.

698
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,380
Fucking incendiary tweet that had z.
was that perfect zero.

699
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,610
You know what I mean?
Right.

700
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:44,200
When you get to the numbers,
140 characters,

701
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,470
it's 1:30
fucking seven shit.

702
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,930
Now I have to alter the top of it,
like it for obsessive people,

703
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,800
but I just hit sand and right then I 
felt an earthquake right on my fucking 

704
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,570
desk and I went on line and it was,
it had hit Marina del Rey right where I 

705
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:09,431
was sitting where I sit and I'm like,
don't fucking go crazy because I was 

706
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:09,431
alone.
I'm like,

707
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:13,420
don't fucking free cow.
Run into the street screaming,

708
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:16,330
knocking on their neighbors.
Don't fucking do that.

709
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,360
Stay in here.
Get some emotional control.

710
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,350
You've just lived through a fucking,
you know,

711
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,360
whatever it's called.
The earth moving.

712
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:26,980
Yeah.
Earthquake.

713
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,300
So I calm myself down.
So I go back to Hawaii the first night 

714
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,120
there.
There's another one.

715
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,480
I almost lost my shit.
It was just beginning finding.

716
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,200
Yeah.
It's so terrifying.

717
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,630
You think of all these people like you 
know,

718
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:50,631
they're,
they're just there and here comes a 

719
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:50,631
tidal wave and here comes a tsunami.
I mean how,

720
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:55,551
how vulnerable we are to all of these 
elements and why and stuff and people 

721
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:58,830
don't think about it.
It's terrifying.

722
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:02,370
Shit.
You can have a fucking nervous breakdown

723
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,100
over that when you definitely can.
I mean,

724
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:07,410
there's always going to be the problem 
that human beings die.

725
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:12,470
They were very finite and whether or not
we get hit with an earthquake or a 

726
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,600
tsunami or hurricane,
we're going to die anyway.

727
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,710
I know.
That's really the terrifying part.

728
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,810
Yeah.
That's the one.

729
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,020
That's the big one.
And then you're sitting there all the 

730
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,020
time wondering how you're going to die,
you know,

731
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,840
like,
are you upset?

732
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,240
Are you scared of that at all?
Do you think of that?

733
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,830
No,
not that much.

734
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:26,400
No.
The only,

735
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,330
what I think about the big worry for me 
would be leaving behind my kids.

736
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,830
Yeah.
That would be the big worry,

737
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,970
you know,
making them sad.

738
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,830
But uh,
we're going to die.

739
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,700
I mean,
I don't want to.

740
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:38,400
Right now I'm enjoying life.
I'm pretty sure it's inevitable

741
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,400
unless something crazy comes along 
technologically over the next hundred 

742
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,900
years when that'd be cool.
They say that it's there.

743
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,700
I don't know if it would be cool because
I don't know what's next.

744
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,370
I'm not convinced that this is the,
a one stop shop.

745
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,850
Like we land in life and this is it,
and this is,

746
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,680
this is where our soul is,
where energy is.

747
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,130
This is the ultimate stop of our 
existence.

748
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,830
Convinced why do you think you'd go 
after this?

749
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,590
I don't know,
but just the fact that this exists.

750
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:09,770
Just the fact that this life that we 
live in where we can communicate with 

751
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,281
our mouth,
where we can see with our eyes where we 

752
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:13,281
walk around and drive around flying 
planes.

753
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:17,640
This life is so fucking insane and so 
crazy and bizarre and fantastic.

754
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,910
Just this.
The idea that this existence exists 

755
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,611
where we shut off every night for eight 
hours and completely vanished from the 

756
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:29,900
reality that we live in,
and then we do it willingly and then 

757
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:29,900
we'd come back in the morning and we 
start all over again.

758
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,780
That alone is fucking fantastic and 
bizarre and strange.

759
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,240
I'm not convinced that when we die,
this ends.

760
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,850
I'm not convinced.
I'm not convinced that anybody dies.

761
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:44,170
I'm not convinced that this whole thing 
is in just one series of wake ups and 

762
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,931
goes and sleeps and wakes up and go and 
while your conscious and while you're 

763
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:51,111
alive,
I'm not convinced that you're in the 

764
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:51,770
same timeline that you were on before.
I think we're Sam's.

765
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,440
We could be.
I mean that's what a lot of people far 

766
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,781
smarter than me are arguing.
You could almost prove that we are part 

767
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,130
of some sort of a crazy gigantic 
computer simulation,

768
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,890
but that might be what the universe is 
in the first place.

769
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:10,100
The whole thing might be.
I mean that might be with nature as we 

770
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,070
try to look at nature as being something
that's,

771
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,130
you know,
this is rock and this is dirt and these 

772
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:16,130
are one.

773
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,650
Yeah,
shorter until you break it down to 

774
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:18,650
molecules,
the tear breakup time summit,

775
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,370
atomic particles that exist everywhere.
Patterns.

776
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:25,371
When you break it down to like a genetic
fibonacci sequence and things along 

777
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:29,991
those lines like that.
You don't need any bigger mystery than 

778
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:34,140
this now as well.
I know today,

779
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,640
Charlie Helen,
great comic.

780
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,430
He died.
He left the earth.

781
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,310
I was just talking about him the other 
day with Jamie Masada,

782
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:46,470
even aside from the laugh factory,
was telling me how sick you have no 

783
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,470
idea.
Yeah,

784
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,980
he just went last night and boy,
he was like a comic and a great person.

785
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,420
Very,
very good person.

786
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,270
I've known that guy for a long time.
It was always a very,

787
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,040
very nice guy.
Yeah,

788
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,880
he was.
He was.

789
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,240
He's a good comic.
Funny Dude.

790
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,500
Native American to lug jokes about white
people steal his land.

791
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,030
He said.
He Goes,

792
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:14,090
God damn,
I'm so glad you called because he's of 

793
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,460
here.
Diane and all.

794
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:20,461
I'm only here from a b list convicts.
That's hilarious.

795
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,970
Who's hyper you stopped in for guests at
that he got.

796
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,030
He goes,
not because he said Jane and David and 

797
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,620
everybody had already called them,
but he was still writing jokes,

798
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,010
you know?
Right in the very

799
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,060
end of it.
Right enough.

800
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,230
I can joke.
Yeah.

801
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:40,480
That was the way that guy was.
He was fun guy.

802
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,710
Very,
very nice guy.

803
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,510
Fun Guy to be around.
Well,

804
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:44,930
look at this again.
Uh,

805
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,870
what's happening with that?
You know,

806
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,040
the native,
the native,

807
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,100
the first nations people that otherwise 
people can't hear you.

808
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:55,230
I'm sorry for drag it to you.
You could drag it back to take a look at

809
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,220
like first nations stuff in the United 
States and how that's just.

810
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,350
It's very fascinating to be come more 
informed on that subject.

811
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,790
Yes.
Essentially genocide.

812
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,640
I mean that's essentially what happened 
to the native Americans.

813
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,770
Their culture was wiped out.
There were stuck into these small camps 

814
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,810
and fenced in and given these areas and 
those areas eventually became casinos in

815
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:18,010
some spots.
I mean,

816
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:20,490
it's the weirdest absorption of a 
concert.

817
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:20,620
Right?

818
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,680
They don't get any of that money.
There's only a couple tribes that got 

819
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,200
any of that money.
I believe it.

820
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,450
Remember why that Jack Abramoff walked 
off with about $30 million from it at 

821
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,470
the bureau of Indian affairs.

822
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,620
No,
I didn't know about this.

823
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,960
Who is that guy?
He's one of those banks,

824
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:40,961
jurors that got caught and I think he 
got four years yet still all that.

825
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,080
The bureau of Indian affairs money,
$30 million of those casinos are 

826
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,791
fucking.
The whole situation is crazy because 

827
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:51,920
it's not like it's all native Americans 
that own and operate those places.

828
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:57,310
Other people are involved too that are 
profiting off of these casinos that are 

829
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:57,310
in places where it's supposed to be 
illegal.

830
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,920
But in native American ones,
because

831
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,010
they had me meet some of their,
uh,

832
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,870
native council or something.
Yeah.

833
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,130
You got in trouble.
Yeah,

834
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,420
because I go.
I know you're,

835
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,110
you're Italian,
you're Jewish.

836
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,550
I know you're,
I know you're Jewish.

837
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,310
I'm,
I could tell that they were Italians and

838
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:18,450
Jews.
They weren't frigging native Americans.

839
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,450
Native American.
Did he have to be,

840
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,700
do you have to be 100 percent 50 50 by 
the Roseanne Barr scale scale to scale 

841
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:33,251
of each tribe makes their own thing.
It's mostly 50.

842
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,160
Mostly 50 or it could be your 
grandparents to 25,

843
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,910
but it has to be pretty 50 slash 50 like
in Hawaii.

844
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,150
One thing I think so cool is that they 
do have a lot of affordable housing for 

845
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,900
the first nations people there.
You know,

846
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:52,901
the Hawaiian people and they get,
they're like guarantee of school and 

847
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:52,901
like they got,
you know,

848
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,170
Hawaii,
the big island,

849
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:59,120
Hawaii has a fantastic socialist state 
and you know,

850
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:01,040
um,
I think that it's just going to make the

851
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:06,041
big turnaround real quick because 
China's just said no gmos,

852
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,500
so we kicked their ass out.
So now I think we're going to like have 

853
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,991
a boom,
but we do need some of that technology 

854
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:18,000
because I think we want to grow organic 
seeds with help.

855
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,340
We don't want to reinvent the organic 
seed.

856
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,250
We want to grow organics with 
technology.

857
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,730
So it's an incredible new,
odd time of,

858
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:34,010
you know,
mixing the best everything.

859
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,920
So what you're talking about is not 
genetically modifying the foods but 

860
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,791
using technology to more efficiently 
till the soil more officially irrigate 

861
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,740
the crops more efficiently,
put nutrients into the ground,

862
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,870
things along those lines,
right?

863
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,430
Yeah.
That's stuff that works well.

864
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:55,431
Not only that,
the stuff that we know the cause and 

865
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:55,431
effect of,
we know it's healthy.

866
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:59,091
We know it's a part of the ecosystem.
We know that there's just a rich 

867
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:00,570
biodiversity when it comes to any place 
where something's growing.

868
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,770
There's bugs involved in rodents,
evolved and BS.

869
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,870
There's a lot of things involved.
It's not just the plant itself.

870
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,110
When you alter the plant,
the real issue seems to be that you 

871
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,400
alter a lot of other shit too.
And then of course,

872
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,580
I don't know how much of this is true or
not,

873
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:19,581
but the idea of cross pollenization and 
people being sued because they have 

874
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:20,490
genetically modified foods growing in 
their,

875
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,240
in their farms because of inadvertent 
cross pollinization.

876
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,280
I mean honestly,
there's very few people who have only 

877
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,490
organic's really?
Yeah.

878
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:37,100
Most farmers there have a mix,
but I think now it's been tilted to 

879
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,460
where it's going to become more and 
more,

880
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,580
uh,
you know,

881
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,560
moving towards a 100 percent organic,
no pesticides and this and that and the 

882
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:47,790
other.
But in order to do that,

883
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:52,791
you've got to reverse a lot of things.
Like you can't let them be spraying 

884
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:56,090
overhead anymore.
They can't be spraying aluminum and 

885
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:56,090
Barium all day if you're going to grow.

886
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,260
Do you,
are you seeing you saying chem trails,

887
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,060
the aluminum barium shit.
You know,

888
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:02,970
I did a whole Saifai special on the 
Scifi channel,

889
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:07,440
a whole episode dedicated to chem trails
and the more attention to it,

890
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,800
the more I think that people are very 
confused as to what's going on.

891
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,190
The government,
I guarantee without a doubt has sprayed 

892
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:16,620
things on people.
They've proven it.

893
00:43:16,621 --> 00:43:17,730
They've proven it.
They did it.

894
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:22,820
I believe it was Detroit.
There was a recent thing they talked 

895
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,101
about doing it in the 19 fifties.
They did tests to see what would happen 

896
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:28,821
if a,
the Communists said came over here and 

897
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:30,810
did some sort of a nuclear attack on the
population or poisonous gas attack.

898
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,500
I,
if they.

899
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,170
They sprayed particles so they could 
track them.

900
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,210
They don't know what the fuck that's 
going to do to people.

901
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,370
They've done things where they've done 
done experiments on the.

902
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:40,770
Whether they've done.
They figured out how to cloud seeding by

903
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:41,730
just doing it.
I mean,

904
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:45,060
they knew the science behind it,
but it's not like they had a vote on the

905
00:43:45,061 --> 00:43:46,500
entire world and ask people,
Hey,

906
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:49,170
can we see clouds or what do you,
what do you guys think?

907
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,800
You know,
no,

908
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:50,790
fuck it.
They just did it.

909
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,360
The government has done things along 
those lines for a long time.

910
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,740
People think that they bring on 
earthquakes too and

911
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,020
yeah,
we talked about that as well and aside 

912
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,020
fi show,
but here's the problem.

913
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,350
There is science behind those trails.
There's a.

914
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:09,351
You can track when it's gonna happen and
when it's not going to happen and it's 

915
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:09,420
all based on the humidity in the 
atmosphere.

916
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:14,570
That's what it's all based on.
When you have a jet engine and it burns 

917
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,540
jet fuel and it's going through the 
atmosphere,

918
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:19,920
it's creating moisture and in conditions
where it's almost cloud like,

919
00:44:19,921 --> 00:44:24,921
like very hazy when a jet engine pass 
through this change of atmosphere and 

920
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:29,601
adding moisture creates a cloud.
So when you see those patterns and 

921
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:30,060
people go,
oh,

922
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:31,410
they're spraying us.
No,

923
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:36,411
they're actually creating a cloud with 
the natural effect of a jet engine 

924
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,370
passing through a certain amount of 
humidity.

925
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,160
That's why you see them in some days,
but other days you don't see.

926
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:46,890
No.
It's just a natural side effect of jet 

927
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:46,890
travel.

928
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,600
Not only that,
they've known about it since the 19 

929
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:50,600
forties.
In the 19 forties,

930
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,190
there was a paper written by the army 
where they were asking what?

931
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,680
What about these things that you see 
behind planes?

932
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,920
They called them consistent condensation
trails,

933
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,390
persistent rather persistent 
condensation trails.

934
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,180
They didn't call him contrary.
I was back then,

935
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:08,450
so they were trying to figure out what 
those things are and they realized that 

936
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,140
this is just what happens if you get an 
engine the past through the environment,

937
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,060
burn fuel and create moisture that in 
certain conditions it creates clouds.

938
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:20,510
See when people start talking about 
aluminum and Barium and all that 

939
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:20,510
different Shit,
look,

940
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,220
there's aluminum in everything.
Not only that,

941
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:28,250
the ground is filled with fucking 
aluminum and a lot of these guys that 

942
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:28,440
are doing these tests locally found 
aluminum in the water.

943
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,080
When you look at their test,
it actually says sludge,

944
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,590
like what in the world are they 
spraying?

945
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,320
This is a conversation I had with the 
guy on the air.

946
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,320
It says sludge sludges,
dirt,

947
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,150
dirt and water,
and he's saying,

948
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:40,860
look,
there's all this aluminum in this water,

949
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,060
and I'm like,
that's not water.

950
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:47,061
That's water with dirt.
So what you're telling me is you did a 

951
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:49,551
scientific test that showed that dirt 
tested positive for being dirt because 

952
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:50,760
that's what it is.
Dirt has seven,

953
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:52,740
10 percent aluminum in it,
sometimes less,

954
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:57,741
sometimes more.
Aluminum is one of the most common 

955
00:45:57,741 --> 00:45:58,020
things you can find in dirt.
So when someone does a test and says,

956
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,430
look,
this aluminum is proof,

957
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:03,480
they're spraying this guy's no fucking 
aluminum is a part of nature.

958
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,110
It's everywhere.
It's in the ground or not.

959
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,240
If they were spraying it,
why would they be spraying?

960
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,650
Hey,
what would it look like?

961
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:11,880
Well,
here's what it wouldn't look like.

962
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,610
Clouds aluminum's heavy.
If you spray it,

963
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:15,870
it's much heavier than moisture.

964
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,850
Will you seen in those things in the 
clouds?

965
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,680
Well,
there's real chem trails.

966
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:23,580
You know,
one of the real chemistry.

967
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,640
Let's hold on a second.
They're burning fucking millions of 

968
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,600
gallons of fuel in the atmosphere that's
real.

969
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,480
Forget about this craziness of them 
spraying shit.

970
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:35,130
Honest.
It's going to alter our personalities.

971
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,330
They're burning fuel in the sky and we 
all take part of this.

972
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:44,040
You did to get here from Hawaii I did to
get here from Vegas this past weekend.

973
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,880
We're all a part of it,
but what it is for sure is not good.

974
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:53,090
You're burning fucking fuel in the sky.
That's the real camp trail where you're 

975
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:58,511
seeing those cloud things.
They're not spraying chemicals at a 

976
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,401
cloud.
It's not some gigantic conspiracy that 

977
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,591
the whole world is in the dark about and
all these politicians are in on and 

978
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:07,530
knowledge.
Do you know how many fucking people 

979
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:07,530
would have to be quiet everyday on a 
daily basis?

980
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:12,351
If they really were spraying aluminum on
people and if they were spraying 

981
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:14,850
aluminum on people,
it wouldn't look like clouds.

982
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:20,360
Those are.
They look like clouds because they are 

983
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:20,360
clouds.
I've asked scientists,

984
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,870
they said if you had aluminum dust,
he sprayed.

985
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,640
It wouldn't look anything like those 
clouds.

986
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:28,670
Even Monsanto says that they are are 
they need to have a radio engineering

987
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,340
they need.
They need a reflection because of what's

988
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,350
in the soil.
A reflection.

989
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:37,450
Yeah.
They need like to create a mirror.

990
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,940
What do you mean?
Oh,

991
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,950
that's what it is.
It's a mirror.

992
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,540
Oh,
you.

993
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:45,700
You're talking about spraying the sky 
that Monsanto said that?

994
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,080
No,
they didn't.

995
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:48,940
They did.
No,

996
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,340
it's a mirror.
It's a mirror effect.

997
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,230
People say this.
I said,

998
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:56,320
I know.
I don't know.

999
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,560
Those people are fucking.
They can project the movie that they 

1000
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,740
planned on fucking putting us all 
through the war.

1001
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,260
You're on an island.
Too long going crazy.

1002
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,600
He goes nuts.
That was crazy.

1003
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:13,780
Nuts and got your fucking mind warped.
I know people say that,

1004
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:18,070
but people also say that all the leaders
of the free world or actually reptiles,

1005
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,920
they also say that.
Go that far.

1006
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,170
I'm glad.
I'm glad you have a fucking.

1007
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,860
Aliens are common to those with the 
planet and a felon and all that.

1008
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:32,110
Whatever it's called.
I don't go there neither.

1009
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,260
It's Nibiru is the planet and it's the 
Annunaki.

1010
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,100
No,
no,

1011
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:37,170
no.
I don't know.

1012
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:38,950
They do know

1013
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:43,990
that there's something out way,
way out far past Jupiter and past Pluto 

1014
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,510
and they think that a bigger actually in
Jupiter,

1015
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,700
they think it might be actually four 
times the size of Jupiter at least,

1016
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
so they think it might be a brown star,
a star that's died out and they think 

1017
00:48:56,331 --> 00:49:00,170
that this source system where might 
actually be a binary source system.

1018
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:05,380
So it's a brown dwarf star and I'm 
apparently there's as many binary star 

1019
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,380
systems as there are,
um,

1020
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,610
with,
with a single star.

1021
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,680
There's a lot of them.
It's like super common.

1022
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:15,010
And if that's the case,
that makes sense for a lot of things 

1023
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,220
including pluto because Pluto's a small,
it's not really a planet,

1024
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:18,110
like that's why they stopped having it 
be a plant anymore.

1025
00:49:18,111 --> 00:49:21,530
They realize it's a part of the Kuyper 
belt was this huge belt of,

1026
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,810
of objects way out at the edge of the 
solar system.

1027
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,090
But that there's a thing called the 
galactic shelf.

1028
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:31,180
This is big dropoff afterwards,
which would indicate there's something 

1029
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,500
absolutely massive just outside of it.
This is all butchered science,

1030
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:38,501
but I'm not a scientist obviously,
but so they think if there is a planet 

1031
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:42,641
out there as something out there that 
these people you know or trying to 

1032
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,390
describe that more likely,
it's like a brown dwarf star,

1033
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:50,350
but it's no people on it.
It's just a giant mass of something.

1034
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,850
I think there might be people,
well,

1035
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:54,980
there couldn't be somewhere.
If there is us,

1036
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,870
if there's us,
there could be somewhere.

1037
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:02,140
The real problem with the alien thing is
that everyone you talked to that says 

1038
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:02,720
they've met aliens or they know aliens 
real.

1039
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:04,670
They're almost all fucked up.

1040
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,790
Almost.
Almost 100 percent.

1041
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,550
So hard.
Weird.

1042
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:14,551
It's like,
I don't believe I don't not believe in 

1043
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:16,811
aliens.
I absolutely believe that aliens could 

1044
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:16,811
be real.
Just like I believe in spiders,

1045
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:18,740
spiders,
spiders are fucking crazy.

1046
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:20,270
You ever met an alien though?

1047
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,560
No,
I don't believe so.

1048
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:26,620
I mean I might've.
I think if you're smart enough to come 

1049
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:29,030
here and be an alien,
you're smart enough to also take a 

1050
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,751
human.
I mean we have fucking camouflage that 

1051
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:31,751
we put on jets where you can't see them 
on radar.

1052
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:36,450
You know,
we have hunters that were clothes that 

1053
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:36,450
looked like trees.
They stand in the.

1054
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:36,800
No one even sees them.
Look,

1055
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:41,890
it's real obvious.
They could pretend to be a person if 

1056
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:41,890
you're so smart,
you could get here from the planet.

1057
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,270
Fuck yourself a billion,
trillion light years away.

1058
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:49,450
Why can't tend to be made on what if 
they're less than less than than me.

1059
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:51,850
They're called

1060
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:57,310
now they are bought and they are created
and programmed and set upon innocent 

1061
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,520
people from our government and this 
government from the the government of 

1062
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,070
the beast,

1063
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,370
the government of the beast,
so the money behind the whole wholesale.

1064
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:08,890
The other problem with that is they're 
not smart enough to make that,

1065
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,510
so you'd have to get people smart enough
to make that.

1066
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:13,060
And the consensus science right now is 
not capable.

1067
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,790
A Bot like that,
the consensus science right now,

1068
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:19,000
it's not a fake person.
That's bullshit.

1069
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:21,760
No sex dolls.
They're close,

1070
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:22,980
but it's not going to trick me.
Well,

1071
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,590
that's just what they're showing you,
but they're 50 years ahead of that shit.

1072
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:31,650
They.
The problem with that kind of thinking 

1073
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,721
is the people that are in control,
so they have the whole Republican think 

1074
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:38,431
sewed up forever,
the people that are in control or not 

1075
00:51:38,431 --> 00:51:41,581
smart enough to create all this stuff.
This stuff has to be created by 

1076
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:41,581
scientists,
the scientists.

1077
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,980
It's all documented stuff like 
everything that's being done.

1078
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,160
All the stuff that's being done today is
all based on the technology that's been 

1079
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,620
created by geniuses over the past 
hundred years from Tesla,

1080
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,800
Edison on down the line,
all these different people have added 

1081
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,180
their campaign contributions and is a 
very clear line between how these things

1082
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:06,181
get created,
so when you have all this fantastic 

1083
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:06,940
stuff like giant televisions and 
satellite Internet and all this,

1084
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,090
there's a direct line that shows how all
this stuff came about,

1085
00:52:10,091 --> 00:52:14,110
but yet they can't sell gay,
clean water or food to the hungry.

1086
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:19,230
Not that they can't,
it's just that they haven't figured out 

1087
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,470
a way to make it so profitable that it's
more profitable than than destroying the

1088
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:25,471
environment and stealing people's 
resources and leaving behind horrible 

1089
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,390
pollution because that's profitable.
That's the way they're doing it.

1090
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:33,510
The real problem is that the 
corporations are allowed to act like 

1091
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:36,211
this,
that individuals become a part of the 

1092
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:36,400
corporations.
And then what is it?

1093
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,400
No,
I really want to say this is how you're 

1094
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:41,400
going to be at,
you know,

1095
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:41,400
jump in there.
But uh,

1096
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,210
you know,
uh,

1097
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,890
oh.
I think I lost the thought.

1098
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,490
No,
I did.

1099
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:53,491
I lost the fuck fucking what you were 
saying was that what I was saying that 

1100
00:52:53,491 --> 00:52:57,331
you reacted to was that they need to 
figure out how to still remain human and

1101
00:52:57,521 --> 00:52:59,350
that the problem is when you have a 
corporation,

1102
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:04,351
you have this big giant group of people 
that's allowed to act in and make money 

1103
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:06,620
without any consideration mentioned.
Didn't say

1104
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,220
yeah,
because it's government.

1105
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,670
The government that they hate and they 
all talk about,

1106
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:15,671
oh,
well we out have a big government and 

1107
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:15,750
they're all on government money.
While they're saying that the replay.

1108
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh,
all of them.

1109
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:22,060
Everybody who hates the big government 
is sucking on the t to big government 

1110
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,830
and that's their job.
They're getting paid to go out there and

1111
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:26,340
say,
we hate big government.

1112
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,640
We need to keep government in check.
But government is the thing that keeps 

1113
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,150
that shit in Czech government is the 
only power that people have.

1114
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,330
Government is the way,
and there's no,

1115
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,360
there's no loss and it has to be a bunch
of corrupt fuck fucking people that are 

1116
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,720
for sale and whores and shit.
There's that.

1117
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:48,721
Eat the law.
It could actually be people who 

1118
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:52,251
understood what being a true 
representative of the American people 

1119
00:53:52,251 --> 00:53:54,270
means.
I think we should start a,

1120
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:55,620
um,
America.

1121
00:53:55,621 --> 00:54:00,621
Here's my solution because I like to 
think of solutions rather than just yap 

1122
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:03,060
about problems like the left and the 
right because they're fucking idiots who

1123
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:05,160
can invent anything.
But,

1124
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,150
um,
you know,

1125
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:08,100
I,
I think we could fix everything,

1126
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,190
uh,
in a real big fat fucking hurry.

1127
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,430
We could fix the economic system if we 
want it to.

1128
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,680
Well,
we just put fucking regulations on it.

1129
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,550
All the things that existed,
you know,

1130
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,170
before Reagan took them away and sold 
down the fucking river,

1131
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,010
just put them back.

1132
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,370
Did you ever watch that documentary 
inside job?

1133
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,700
Yes.
Fantastic.

1134
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,970
Because wasn't it great?
Yeah.

1135
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:29,750
Terrifying.
Terrifying and fantastic.

1136
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:34,751
And the guy who got on coke,
they're the fucking guys in the wolf of 

1137
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:34,790
Wall Street.
Yeah,

1138
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
exactly.
And the guy who created actually give 

1139
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,120
him some credit right now I'm Charles h 
dot Ferguson.

1140
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,710
And he's,
he's awesome.

1141
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,840
It was a really fantastic job.
He did.

1142
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:50,140
It was just a brilliant and insightful 
view on how these problems occur.

1143
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:55,540
Who Profits,
how these people that start out as 

1144
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,820
people who are the educators who are 
recommending the economic,

1145
00:54:58,821 --> 00:55:00,920
uh,
professors that are recommending certain

1146
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:05,921
standards and those standards get passed
and these guys wind up getting giant 

1147
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:08,390
jobs with the banks that profited from 
them changing the regulations.

1148
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:10,510
It's fucking madness.
It's just shelving.

1149
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,950
It's on everybody's face.
Yeah.

1150
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,760
Well they get off on that now for the,
they,

1151
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,640
they,
you know,

1152
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:20,640
they used to like hide net with their 
secret organizations.

1153
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:23,490
But then they made a big change once 
they started on that cocaine,

1154
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:28,850
then they like to put it in people's 
face and they kept coming with it and 

1155
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:32,271
it's like not just put in their face but
bend over and spread their ass cheeks 

1156
00:55:32,271 --> 00:55:34,140
and rub it right on your nose.
A vacation house.

1157
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,390
They are,
they are just like,

1158
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:41,391
sure they can get away with anything and
they have been allowed to get away with 

1159
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:42,960
anything.
Not Wireless fucking ever been arrested.

1160
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,250
I think that's what's going to change 
and I think it's going to change because

1161
00:55:46,251 --> 00:55:51,251
of the Internet because this information
was all hidden before we use this same 

1162
00:55:51,251 --> 00:55:52,460
type of behavior.
It's not new.

1163
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,610
It's not that it just erupted in 2000,
whatever.

1164
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,410
It's been around forever.
You know?

1165
00:55:57,411 --> 00:56:02,411
We have the direct line that we learned 
about the kind of regulations that 

1166
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:06,041
Reagan had stopped and what,
what happened from then to the Bush 

1167
00:56:06,171 --> 00:56:07,610
administration.
We know all that stuff now,

1168
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:10,200
but they just moved while it was all 
going on a private

1169
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,090
pockets,
so that's the short of it.

1170
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,960
They made laws that made it possible for
them to do that,

1171
00:56:15,961 --> 00:56:19,380
but this is so incredible about it is 
that it seems that,

1172
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:24,750
and this is why I ran for president 
because it was like when are they going 

1173
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:24,750
to put a a,
a,

1174
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:29,750
a,
an American person,

1175
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:36,780
like a working American person in a seat
at those tables where money is 

1176
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,830
apportioned.
Well,

1177
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:40,780
that ever happened,

1178
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,550
you mean a person that represents the 
average person,

1179
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:43,970
the average,

1180
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:49,830
the of the public of John and Joan q 
public.

1181
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:55,950
So I think we should start a,
I think that should be the name of our 

1182
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,611
corporation of Americans ink and that we
should apply for a privatized contracts 

1183
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:04,390
like everybody else is doing.

1184
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,870
So America,
ANC being,

1185
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,690
you know,
there's a friend of mine that's starting

1186
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:13,480
a business,
a more of an avenue rather for,

1187
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:17,700
for people to fund politicians the way 
corporations have been funny politicians

1188
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,880
and to encourage politicians that are 
responsible and ethical and that you 

1189
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,511
could profit from that just as much as 
you could profit from having worked for 

1190
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:31,221
some evil corporation.
And that if you got like sort of almost 

1191
00:57:31,221 --> 00:57:31,260
like a kickstarter type thing to,
uh,

1192
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,500
to represent like strong ethical 
position.

1193
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,210
But anytime you put money into it's 
going to be wrong and suck ass.

1194
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,720
But if it's all transparent,
the idea being,

1195
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:45,721
if they're not representing a 
corporation that's going to profit 

1196
00:57:45,721 --> 00:57:48,750
instead,
they're representing people that want 

1197
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:48,750
more activity and ethics.
See the money,

1198
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,240
there's profit.
You see what I'm saying?

1199
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,980
But you see what I'm saying though,
like people would be willing to 

1200
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,110
contribute and then someone else will 
control your system though.

1201
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,910
But I don't think it would be their 
system anymore.

1202
00:57:57,911 --> 00:57:59,740
It'll be our system if it was done 
correctly.

1203
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:04,800
What I'm saying is that our system would
be different than the system right now 

1204
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:04,960
because there wouldn't be a need for 
profit.

1205
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,850
So the need for profit exists now where 
you,

1206
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:11,380
you get the politicians take the money 
from the corporations,

1207
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:13,570
the corporations give them money because
they want profit.

1208
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:18,810
This would be people giving them money 
because they want ethics and morality 

1209
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,200
and a healthy society.
So I think the,

1210
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:25,450
so much money comes from taxpayers as it
is to have that be an option instead to 

1211
00:58:25,741 --> 00:58:26,710
have it.
People donate,

1212
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,840
people that really care about it,
donate a certain amount.

1213
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:32,170
If everybody donates a little,
it would be a staggering amount of money

1214
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:33,330
out of 300 million people,
right?

1215
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,710
I,
yes.

1216
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,230
And See,
I've gone to therapy,

1217
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,770
um,
you know,

1218
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,790
there,
there,

1219
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,360
there is the public common wealth and 
uh,

1220
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:52,460
you know,
for people who do pay taxes and they 

1221
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,660
should get something back for the taxes 
they pay,

1222
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,950
that's the whole point.
Right?

1223
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,760
And it should be in the form of 
hospitals,

1224
00:58:59,761 --> 00:59:01,080
schools,
uh,

1225
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,200
clinics,
free legal advice.

1226
00:59:04,201 --> 00:59:09,201
I mean,
that's what you pay your fucking taxes 

1227
00:59:09,201 --> 00:59:11,121
for healthcare.
That's why I get paid for roads and 

1228
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:13,881
other things too.
You certainly don't pay your taxes to 

1229
00:59:13,881 --> 00:59:14,340
subsidize somebody whose statement from 
you

1230
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:15,620
100 percent.
I agree.

1231
00:59:15,621 --> 00:59:20,621
I not only that,
I would take it a step further and say 

1232
00:59:20,621 --> 00:59:23,410
community centers should be mandatory in
almost community where kids can go with 

1233
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,800
they're protected,
where they can learn things,

1234
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:29,930
where they can learn sports and skills 
and games and places where they can,

1235
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,160
you know,
we can educate in inside of communities.

1236
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,250
I think that will be just like a gas 
station should be a normal part of every

1237
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,600
sort of,
uh,

1238
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:42,500
any sort of city or town.
And it should be funded,

1239
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,170
should be funded by the government 
because it's there to improve kids.

1240
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:50,171
And did there to improve people,
but education free as fuck across the 

1241
00:59:50,171 --> 00:59:55,061
board,
straight through the university all the 

1242
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:55,061
way to the end.
We should pay for that.

1243
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:56,720
We should make it,
we should make it tough to get into.

1244
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:59,070
You have to work hard.
But it's fucking free.

1245
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,570
Education.
College education was free in California

1246
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,190
before.
And that's a first thing.

1247
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:06,000
Reagan got rid,
of course.

1248
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,190
Yeah.
He was governor.

1249
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,230
I'm not shocked and that should be free.
Um,

1250
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:13,060
college mean we can't encourage 
laziness,

1251
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:18,360
but we can certainly support people that
want to learn and make it so that it's 

1252
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:18,370
less of a thing.
I mean,

1253
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,520
one of the reasons why good doctors get 
so God damn greedy is because they got a

1254
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:25,390
fucking huge bill behind them from La,
from medical school.

1255
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:28,030
So many people go into by the time 
they're into office,

1256
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,360
they have these giant fucking.
All these kids that are

1257
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,110
getting out now,
they're in a big old financial hole.

1258
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,490
You know,
they're in a whole.

1259
01:00:34,491 --> 01:00:37,220
And what it means is,
I mean this is just part of the scam and

1260
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:39,690
all that was like,
as their parents signed,

1261
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,600
you know,
where their house is,

1262
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,460
houses away for the education,
then they come and take the house.

1263
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:47,030
Hello.
It's just a big frigging Ponzi scam.

1264
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:49,820
It's the shell game times a million.

1265
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:54,860
Well,
it's even more of the shell game when 

1266
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,271
it's obvious that when you find out that
the banks actually banked on people 

1267
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:58,100
faulting on their loans.
Yeah.

1268
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,230
Defaulting people falling apart and 
being held their homes repossessed.

1269
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,720
They actually banked on that,
profited off of it.

1270
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:07,260
That really pissed me off because it was
like,

1271
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:08,130
you know,
you know,

1272
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:10,350
then what that means is like,
you know,

1273
01:01:10,351 --> 01:01:14,160
what that means in terms of cost,
real cost,

1274
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,160
not bullshit paper cost,
but real customer community.

1275
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,940
That means a lot more little kids are 
getting going to get beaten to death.

1276
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:24,240
And it means a lot more little kids are 
going to get trafficked.

1277
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,410
And you know,
uh,

1278
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,070
I do think the poverty,
just putting that on people.

1279
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,230
So you can have a,
you know,

1280
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,880
gambier fourth mistress and another,
uh,

1281
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:34,640
you know,
it.

1282
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,360
Endangered Species.
Kate.

1283
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,560
Yeah.
Said she saved the best content in the 

1284
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:45,730
history of the Internet.
Give you a fourth mistress it endangered

1285
01:01:45,731 --> 01:01:46,520
species.
K,

1286
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,840
what kind of Cape would you make?
Like,

1287
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:54,950
like a human skulls to stitched all 
together as a class when you walk in 

1288
01:01:55,891 --> 01:02:00,890
virgin blood vials dangling around your 
neck with clocks.

1289
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,220
Tramp.
That's a real baller though.

1290
01:02:02,221 --> 01:02:04,960
If he's got four mistresses,
guys responded.

1291
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,580
But until you see,
um,

1292
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,390
like my boyfriend always says whenever 
we see a,

1293
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,610
you know,
when we're here in California originally

1294
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,680
a rich old fucker and is,
you know,

1295
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,200
strip or wife.
And Johnny always says,

1296
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,100
that is

1297
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,410
proof that our currency is sound.

1298
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:28,520
That's funny.
Proof that our currency is sound.

1299
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,290
That was actually very funny,

1300
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,140
but you know,
I mean,

1301
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,230
when you make everything for sale,
you know,

1302
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,880
pretty soon.
Yeah.

1303
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,480
Money doesn't mean anything.
That's why I think they're such fucking 

1304
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,780
geniuses.
Here's how fucking stupid they are.

1305
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:46,920
But they think they're smart.
The Financial Wizards,

1306
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:51,820
the smart guy,
the smart guy,

1307
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,940
the money guy,
the money guys.

1308
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:57,390
Yeah.
They're so fucking stupid.

1309
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:02,730
They,
they make everything at a certain point 

1310
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:05,060
it's going to hit a wall and end and 
they put that right in there too.

1311
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,970
It can't go on.
It's not sustainable.

1312
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,790
It's going to crash and you're going to 
fucking get caught.

1313
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:15,390
But I think that's what they like 
because they're so sociopath's.

1314
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,960
They liked the fucking people over parts
so much.

1315
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:24,320
You know,
they just keep denying that there's 

1316
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:24,320
going to be a reckoning,
but of course there is,

1317
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,480
and that's already happening.
I fucking reckoning right now on Wall 

1318
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,450
Street and everybody knows it,
but nobody talks about it.

1319
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,120
Well,
I think that's just what people do.

1320
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,630
Norton or ordinarily without logic and 
without,

1321
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,720
without enlightenment.
That's what we do as far as what we do 

1322
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,180
as far as the pollution of the 
environment as far as global warming.

1323
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,140
You're right,
you're right.

1324
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:47,490
People would not do that.
You're right,

1325
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,940
because they will factor in the true 
cost.

1326
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:55,150
Not the.
Not the one in the books that you have 

1327
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:55,150
to cook.
Oh,

1328
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:58,110
I'm 100 percent agreement with you,
but I think that the consequences of 

1329
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:58,110
their actions or just something that 
like,

1330
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:58,820
Eh,
I'll deal with that eventually.

1331
01:03:58,821 --> 01:04:03,821
Yeah.
They don't think they're like 

1332
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:03,821
engineering this,
this idea of infinite growth.

1333
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:03,821
Hit the wall.

1334
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:04,350
Yeah.
And,

1335
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:07,450
and they fuck over like all the old 
people and everything.

1336
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,920
They fuck over every and then right 
away,

1337
01:04:09,921 --> 01:04:14,921
what's the first thing they do?
They start working on the other side of 

1338
01:04:14,921 --> 01:04:15,380
the street.
They go to Rehab,

1339
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,060
right.
And they,

1340
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,230
then they come out,
you know,

1341
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:20,990
I've been sober for 14 days and then you
have,

1342
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:21,040
I have

1343
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:26,040
to like say Goddamn fucking is such a 
hypocritical.

1344
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:30,620
And then they go and they,
they work to try to stop corruption.

1345
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:35,680
That's my favorite.
Expose corruption and write books on 

1346
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,970
this is.
It's all like so crazy.

1347
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:43,030
I think though that the.
See what I'm saying is that I think 

1348
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:46,211
people do shit when they think that.
It's like why do people smoke 

1349
01:04:46,211 --> 01:04:46,940
cigarettes?
They know the consequences or cancer.

1350
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:50,000
They know they're going to get it.
But then eventually,

1351
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:54,230
but the smoke right now is better for me
than not having a smoke.

1352
01:04:54,231 --> 01:04:55,760
So I want to write down the 
consequences.

1353
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:56,720
Fuck it.
I'll deal with them later.

1354
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,940
And I think that's a lot of times when 
people are saying when they're,

1355
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:03,050
when they're creating these sort of laws
that allow them to.

1356
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:06,060
The concept of infinite growth doesn't 
make any sense.

1357
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:11,061
It doesn't work on paper.
There's only a certain amount of 

1358
01:05:11,061 --> 01:05:11,061
resources,
a certain amount of space on earth.

1359
01:05:11,061 --> 01:05:12,500
Like if you just keep counting numbers,
you're going to run out of space.

1360
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:17,310
I think they're going like,
this is shit is over now.

1361
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,170
As much

1362
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:23,200
as I can grab that advanced,
I think what people are doing is just 

1363
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,390
doing what people have always done.
Acting without that much concern for the

1364
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:28,330
consequences because they don't have to 
deal with the consequences right now.

1365
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:33,660
It's like when,
when you get up in the morning and you 

1366
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:33,660
know,
and you look at,

1367
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,511
this is a cake from last night that 
looks so delicious and it's right next 

1368
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:40,621
to like all your fresh vegetables that 
you were thinking about making a hemp 

1369
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:41,080
protein shake with.
I,

1370
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,970
I get a lot of times to go for that 
cake.

1371
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,440
You know why?
Because fuck it.

1372
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,790
It's right there.
You know,

1373
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,650
I know it's bad for you.
I know it's sugar.

1374
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:49,090
I know I'm going to feel like shit 
later,

1375
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:53,350
but right now I'm going to feel good to 
feel good when I eat that red velvet,

1376
01:05:53,351 --> 01:05:54,400
own yummy,
yummy,

1377
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:54,730
yummy.

1378
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:59,930
And I think that's what these folks are 
doing that we're not gonna do that.

1379
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:02,430
If your intent is to,
you know,

1380
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,400
lose two pounds by three days from now,
you're going to fuck.

1381
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:08,510
You know,
you need adderall.

1382
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:11,500
But I don't really go for the cake.
I'm pretty healthy.

1383
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:15,150
But what I'm saying is it's an instinct 
if,

1384
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:20,540
well it's a lower instincts based on the
Peter Principle and all that shit and 

1385
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:25,360
the peanut peanut.
What's that one penis principles.

1386
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,910
That one,
I can't think of.

1387
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,310
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
Whatever.

1388
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:32,710
Is that one?
I can't remember.

1389
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,530
Um,
what is it called?

1390
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,020
You know what I mean?
Yes.

1391
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,250
Maybe it's broken my brain.
I normally have that right there.

1392
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:46,780
It could with a slight alternative.
Murphy's law,

1393
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:51,940
Murphy's law,
Monsanto could fix murphy's law I was 

1394
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,390
using.
It can be confusing it with Moore's law.

1395
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:53,440
Um,
I wonder,

1396
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:59,970
Monsanto could come up with a chip,
a chip or wherever,

1397
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,800
but you know what they would do with 
that chip?

1398
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,980
They would just fucking deload your 
brain and turn you into a robot.

1399
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:11,700
That's what they would do.
They've already need to be turned into 

1400
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:11,700
robot.
The NSA came out today.

1401
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,740
There was an article that said the NSA 
has 100 percent access to iphones.

1402
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,830
They can look at your camera,
read your texts,

1403
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,410
listened to your microphone,
like,

1404
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,520
keep your microphone on.
Even if your phone is off.

1405
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:25,740
Is that a surprise to people?
Um,

1406
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:28,090
that 100 percent access?
That's pretty fascinating.

1407
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:33,220
The thing about,
and this is one of the reasons why our 

1408
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,770
podcast sponsors sponsored by Ting 
tings,

1409
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:38,950
a company that uses android phones and 
what I like to get an android.

1410
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,050
What I like about android phones.
Yeah,

1411
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:46,051
you've got an android.
You can take the battery out so you can 

1412
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:46,051
shut it off.
Not saying that the government is really

1413
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:50,431
listening to you,
but the idea that that's possible that 

1414
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:52,921
anybody can just turn your microphone on
it anytime or turn your camera on at 

1415
01:07:52,921 --> 01:07:52,921
anytime.

1416
01:07:52,921 --> 01:07:57,030
To me sounds ridiculous,
but we know that the NSA has that 

1417
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:00,141
capability.
If you have an android phone and you 

1418
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:00,141
just take the battery out,
can't do that with an iphone.

1419
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:01,810
I found some weird,
a lot of weird shit about the iphone.

1420
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,640
The memory is all in there.
You can't get it out.

1421
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,220
The fucking the batteries in there and 
can't get it out.

1422
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:10,190
No accidents are dying.
Know people are dying.

1423
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:13,600
Making those killing themselves.
You know what's hilarious about that?

1424
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,710
I had this conversation with guy who was
trying.

1425
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:21,150
I have a friend than not a good friend,
but this guy that I know that always 

1426
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:24,641
tries to give me the republican point of
view on things like he's a sensible 

1427
01:08:24,641 --> 01:08:27,761
logical guy,
know we were talking about this factory 

1428
01:08:27,761 --> 01:08:28,010
in China where people are jumping off 
the roof and he goes,

1429
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:33,011
well,
do you know how many people are working 

1430
01:08:33,011 --> 01:08:33,011
at that factory?

1431
01:08:33,011 --> 01:08:33,011
And uh,
I said,

1432
01:08:33,011 --> 01:08:36,401
yeah,
I just like about half a million people 

1433
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:36,401
or something crazy.
And he goes,

1434
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:37,910
and if you look at the average 
population of a half a million people,

1435
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,040
the amount of suicides is pretty 
standard.

1436
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:41,030
And I said,
yeah,

1437
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:46,210
but they're killing themselves at work.
How many fucking people killed 

1438
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:50,071
themselves at work?
Like that's not standard is nothing 

1439
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:52,931
standard about that.
That's ridiculous that that concept is 

1440
01:08:52,931 --> 01:08:56,260
ridiculous.
Idiot talk or say it's like a fucking a 

1441
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:01,230
tower of bullshit.
There's a lot of people that don't want 

1442
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:01,230
to be silly though.
You know what I mean?

1443
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:03,470
They want to be sensible.
Come on.

1444
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:07,660
We have enough fact and data now that we
can make informed decisions.

1445
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:11,500
W W we have enough stuff to make 
informed intelligence,

1446
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,220
intelligent decisions that work for the,
you know,

1447
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:20,280
the p for everyone,
not just the few at the expense of the 

1448
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,330
many but for everyone and um,
you know,

1449
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,060
that I feel like,
hey,

1450
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:25,790
you know,
yeah,

1451
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:28,900
we're on our way out and everything's 
fucked up and dying and over,

1452
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:33,790
but I think it's our Karma to fucking do
it right this time because,

1453
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:34,330
uh,
you know,

1454
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:36,670
helping each other and such,
you know,

1455
01:09:36,671 --> 01:09:37,970
trying to,
um,

1456
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:43,350
take a step back from needing so much 
and being more into sharing and new 

1457
01:09:45,131 --> 01:09:46,740
thoughts,
new solutions,

1458
01:09:46,741 --> 01:09:51,741
solution based thinking and stuff.
I think this is a great time for that 

1459
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:55,771
and we're,
we're really evolving into that and 

1460
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:56,740
people can't back away from it anymore.
So it's not over.

1461
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:57,830
Well,
I,

1462
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,020
I think that,
you know,

1463
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:04,530
I do think it's over first humans,
but I think that when people get that in

1464
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:10,531
their head,
it's going to make them really mutate 

1465
01:10:10,531 --> 01:10:10,531
quickly and go,
oh my God,

1466
01:10:10,531 --> 01:10:15,200
uh,
I better get right with my maker and 

1467
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,900
actually start fucking doing some of the
shit that I know is,

1468
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,230
you know,
the right thing to do just because I'm a

1469
01:10:20,231 --> 01:10:22,210
human being.
Right.

1470
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:23,800
I think that's happening.

1471
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,190
I think that's happening as well.
That's why I have hope.

1472
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,580
I think that's evident in what I read 
online.

1473
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:33,450
I mean even points that I don't agree 
with the extreme left points,

1474
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:38,451
the extreme progressive positions,
which a lot of times I don't take those 

1475
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:41,781
positions,
but I liked the fact that those 

1476
01:10:41,781 --> 01:10:41,781
positions are really public now.
You know,

1477
01:10:41,781 --> 01:10:43,630
what I like is how the left.
Uh,

1478
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,150
I like how I like to watch it on 
twitter,

1479
01:10:46,151 --> 01:10:48,340
you know,
I like how the left light goes,

1480
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:51,580
right for character assassination,
but then,

1481
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:56,581
you know,
that's what people do when they've lost 

1482
01:10:56,581 --> 01:10:56,581
the argument.

1483
01:10:56,581 --> 01:10:56,581
Add homonyms.
Yeah.

1484
01:10:56,581 --> 01:10:56,930
Well,
you know,

1485
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:58,430
sometimes it's,
they're good points though.

1486
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:03,490
It's a good to consider how fucked up 
someone else before you listen to their 

1487
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:06,461
point of view on something.
If you know that they're kicking babies 

1488
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:06,461
in their spare time,
it's probably something to pay attention

1489
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:07,370
to.
I know what you mean though.

1490
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,660
Yeah.
Like,

1491
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:09,450
yeah,
I'm,

1492
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,150
I'm,
I'm just trying to say like,

1493
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,650
just because somebody,
you know,

1494
01:11:13,651 --> 01:11:18,651
they're trying to.
The real thing is that they want the 

1495
01:11:18,651 --> 01:11:19,950
monopoly of definition.
That's what they're after.

1496
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:24,951
That's the real war.
They want things to mean what they want 

1497
01:11:24,951 --> 01:11:28,131
them.
That's a very good try to censor people 

1498
01:11:28,131 --> 01:11:28,131
who are saying something else.

1499
01:11:28,131 --> 01:11:29,630
That's a very powerful statement.
What you said,

1500
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:31,250
the monopoly of,
of definition.

1501
01:11:31,251 --> 01:11:32,360
That's so,
so true.

1502
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,490
And I've never

1503
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:36,600
tried to censor that debate in a free 
society.

1504
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:39,180
We have debate which has more than one 
opinion.

1505
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,850
Yes.
Your mindset.

1506
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:45,630
I'm like Monsanto Science.
It's the same mental thing and uh,

1507
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,240
you know,
uh,

1508
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,010
it's a rigid ideology.
Yeah.

1509
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:51,570
And it makes no sense.
It doesn't,

1510
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,600
it doesn't apply data and fact as it,
it doesn't directly apply data and 

1511
01:11:56,821 --> 01:11:57,210
facts.

1512
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:02,470
What's also,
I think there's a lot of these people 

1513
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:04,511
that are involved in both sides,
whether it's the conservative movement 

1514
01:12:04,511 --> 01:12:08,051
for sure,
or the really progressive movement that 

1515
01:12:08,051 --> 01:12:08,120
are really just assholes that want to 
get heard.

1516
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,980
I really just love giving their opinion 
and they love the attention that even if

1517
01:12:12,981 --> 01:12:13,670
they have a point,

1518
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:16,910
well that's part of MK Ultra mind 
control.

1519
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:21,911
You say it is what I liked that.
How many times do you use the word 

1520
01:12:21,911 --> 01:12:23,990
binary because that it is a binary.
And uh,

1521
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:28,450
what Mk ultra does is it's like these 
two groups there,

1522
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,630
they're like,
you know,

1523
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:34,750
they both work for the same people.
They both get paid from the same people,

1524
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:39,470
the Democrats and the Republicans.
And what they do is they use monopoly.

1525
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,950
They tried to monopolize the definition 
so they can fundraise.

1526
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:47,540
And I say it's like the fundraising.
Those parties are the fundraising arm of

1527
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,900
the prison,
military media,

1528
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,690
wedding,
industrial complex,

1529
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:54,830
you know,
I mean,

1530
01:12:54,831 --> 01:12:59,831
they just want to confuse people so that
people vote against their own better 

1531
01:12:59,831 --> 01:13:03,170
judgment and their own best interests.
And that's their strategy.

1532
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:08,171
That's their whole mk alter strategy.
How they get people to stop thinking 

1533
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:13,010
that they deserve an answer and a 
solution for the tax monies they pay.

1534
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:18,250
That is what the tea party was 
originally about before it got waylaid 

1535
01:13:18,951 --> 01:13:20,870
by punk ass hoes.

1536
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,900
Well,
isn't that what always happens?

1537
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:28,040
So occupy Wall Street,
they said at one point in time they 

1538
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,720
think that one of the three people in 
occupy Wall Street was really like FBI.

1539
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,790
They're really like some undercover 
agents.

1540
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:36,820
They infiltrate and doesn't that happen 
with everything that happened with the 

1541
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:40,091
tea party as well.
The people that thought that the tea 

1542
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:40,091
party was like,
look,

1543
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:42,860
we're gonna demand a responsible 
government and a government that follows

1544
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:45,590
the constitution.
Then all of a sudden these crazy Fox got

1545
01:13:45,591 --> 01:13:50,591
involved in racism and nuttiness yeah.
What better way to diffuse a movement 

1546
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:53,210
then to make to marginalize them by 
making them look ridiculous?

1547
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:58,240
Well,
they do send in their people and I'm 

1548
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:58,240
always have always will

1549
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,220
monopoly of definition again.
And it is that.

1550
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:04,230
Then they can control their own 
opposition and you know,

1551
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,400
you know,
that works at that work.

1552
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:08,010
That's how power does it.

1553
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:13,200
That's what ideologies due to the 
monopoly of definition that you 

1554
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,230
described,
which is such a great phrase again.

1555
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,370
Um,
but that,

1556
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,470
that's,
that is the issue with the left.

1557
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:22,471
That's the issue with the right.
That's the issue with having teams is 

1558
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:25,741
like you decide that this is how we look
at things and how we look at things is 

1559
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:26,380
how they are.

1560
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:26,910
Well,
uh,

1561
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,690
the left does it for a certain reason 
because that's how they fundraise out of

1562
01:14:30,691 --> 01:14:33,720
like the,
like the leather bags,

1563
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,730
like the Democrats begged for money.
It's like we need $3 by midnight.

1564
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:43,650
Have you gotten those emails are not a 
part of that list.

1565
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:44,960
And uh,
you know,

1566
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:47,100
they're begging for money and the 
Republicans,

1567
01:14:47,101 --> 01:14:49,590
like they begged for money too,
but they demand it,

1568
01:14:49,591 --> 01:14:54,591
like they have the right to it because 
its sovereignty that they're defending 

1569
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:59,150
but they're not.
They're frigging yanking people to get 

1570
01:14:59,150 --> 01:14:59,150
their money.
That's all they're doing.

1571
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,050
Both of them.
They work together.

1572
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:06,530
They are a system of mind control that 
helps them move public money into 

1573
01:15:07,261 --> 01:15:10,950
private pockets.
It's so fucking ridiculous.

1574
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:16,160
I mean,
I feel sorry for people that they have 

1575
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:21,081
been so manipulated and you know,
all the time they're losing everything.

1576
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,100
Yeah,
no,

1577
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,680
it's horrible that it's.
It is,

1578
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:27,140
it's a,
it's a disgusting aspect of human beings

1579
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,320
and a weird thing where we're tribal 
people and I think ultimately we have 

1580
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,160
that instinct to be a part of a group 
and when people are part of that group,

1581
01:15:34,161 --> 01:15:37,520
you see this group think is so strong.
It's so prevalent.

1582
01:15:37,521 --> 01:15:40,550
I've had conversations with people about
anything.

1583
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:42,950
I had a conversation with a guy who I,
you know,

1584
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,570
before this conversation I respected 
them online will about um,

1585
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:50,240
abortion where the Richard Dawkins it 
said that a,

1586
01:15:50,241 --> 01:15:55,241
um,
a fetus inside a woman's body is like 

1587
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:55,430
less human than,
uh,

1588
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,930
than,
than a pig is,

1589
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:59,990
you know,
I go just as human as a peer,

1590
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,840
that Dale Carnegie Book,
it was just a weird.

1591
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,280
It's a weird statement.
And I,

1592
01:16:04,281 --> 01:16:05,120
I,
I took,

1593
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:05,870
I tweeted,
well,

1594
01:16:05,871 --> 01:16:09,590
that's silly because everyone knows that
a fetus can become a human being.

1595
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,170
All right?
That's the idea behind the abortion.

1596
01:16:12,171 --> 01:16:17,171
Like you're being very disingenuous if 
you pretended the idea behind the 

1597
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:19,130
abortion isn't that what you're doing is
you're stopping a potential human being.

1598
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,680
A pig is not,
you're not going to stop.

1599
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,240
It's going to become a person.
It's not.

1600
01:16:23,241 --> 01:16:25,460
It doesn't turn into a carriage or a 
fucking pumpkin.

1601
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:30,670
Alright?
It's a pig of a fetus is a part of a 

1602
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:30,670
person that has nothing to do with a 
woman's right.

1603
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,780
To choose the woman's right to choose as
a completely different time.

1604
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:35,480
So he starts calling me a Republican and
saying like,

1605
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,580
you know that I,
I don't respect.

1606
01:16:37,581 --> 01:16:39,260
Isn't this all about controlling a 
woman's body?

1607
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:39,940
Like.
Absolutely.

1608
01:16:39,941 --> 01:16:40,010
Yeah.

1609
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:45,050
No,
they want you to say what they are 

1610
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:45,050
saying.
Yay.

1611
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:45,050
They had a bunch of fucking.

1612
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,110
And they want to diffuse anything that 
you're saying that might be logical.

1613
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,240
Their economies to.
There's a lot of that.

1614
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,110
It is

1615
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:52,710
like,
um,

1616
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,330
you know,
you know it.

1617
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:57,730
It's just like,
it's going to go my way or the highway.

1618
01:16:57,731 --> 01:16:59,680
We don't allow you.
To me,

1619
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:04,681
it's like this.
We don't allow old women or open their 

1620
01:17:04,681 --> 01:17:05,950
fucking mouth and in the general 
theater.

1621
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:07,510
Excuse me,
bitch.

1622
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:10,550
That's what it feels like to me.
So that's why I just go,

1623
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:11,810
well,
you wait a minute,

1624
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,310
wait a minute.

1625
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:14,540
Well,
with this guy that I was talking to,

1626
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:17,690
I don't think it was that.
I think it was he was just following the

1627
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:18,720
ideology.
You,

1628
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:23,770
you're always supposed to support a 
woman's right to choose and you're 

1629
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:24,920
always supposed to marginalize any,
uh,

1630
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,800
anything that would point to the idea of
abortion being a bad thing.

1631
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:29,930
And I'm saying they're not mutually 
exclusive.

1632
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:34,960
Like I think a woman should be.
We'll do whatever she wants to do with 

1633
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:34,960
our body.
I can't control that,

1634
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,270
but it does get crazy when you're 
talking about a boarding,

1635
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:38,250
an eight month old fetus.
I mean,

1636
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,430
at what point in time,
when does it get crazy?

1637
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,680
It's not crazy when it's a group of 
cells.

1638
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:44,270
I agree.
You're pulling out a group of cells.

1639
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:46,640
Is it crazy ones that big?
Is it crazy when it's that big?

1640
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,310
Is it crazy one?
It can exist outside of your body is.

1641
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:50,090
I mean,
I don't know

1642
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,400
this,
but to say that this is not a discussion

1643
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:54,450
for today.
Huge,

1644
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:57,630
a huge subject.
It needs a lot of debate and you know,

1645
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:02,631
you have to look at what's being 
censored and there's a reason why it's 

1646
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:02,631
being censored.

1647
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:07,110
People are uncomfortable with it.
There are also uncomfortable with their 

1648
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,110
decision that,
you know,

1649
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,240
they want to be able to have an 
abortion.

1650
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:08,020
Then if you say,
well,

1651
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:08,620
okay,
you know,

1652
01:18:08,621 --> 01:18:10,590
you're killing a potential human being.
Like,

1653
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:11,090
oh no,
no,

1654
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:12,400
no,
I'm getting ringing some cells.

1655
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:17,610
Okay.
At what point in time has it become a 

1656
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:17,610
person is that's an actual conversation.
I think that's a real conversation to,

1657
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:20,920
to pretend that it's not,
is a part of that whole ideology thing.

1658
01:18:20,921 --> 01:18:25,921
It's a part of that thing where people 
as your fucking phone going off your 

1659
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:28,220
kids going,
mom,

1660
01:18:28,221 --> 01:18:29,350
the CIA's at the house.

1661
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:34,130
Wait a minute,
I just got to say I'm on the radio.

1662
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:35,980
I'll call you.
Are you okay?

1663
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:40,660
Wait,

1664
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,610
I told him I was going on here anyway.
Sorry.

1665
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,580
It tells a fucking stupid and it could 
like.

1666
01:18:50,581 --> 01:18:54,030
It has a simple solution like for people
like me,

1667
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:56,880
like we we think different than other 
people,

1668
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:02,120
but we can see that there's a simple and
much cheaper solution to all of these 

1669
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:02,940
problems.
You know,

1670
01:19:02,941 --> 01:19:05,730
if if logic,
data and fact are applied,

1671
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:11,250
I think there are being applied now more
than ever before and that's why I have 

1672
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,330
hope.
And then also I think this idea of teams

1673
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:16,690
of a Republican left wing Democrat or 
Democrat,

1674
01:19:16,691 --> 01:19:21,691
left wing Republican,
right wing that's looking more and more 

1675
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:22,120
silly every day,
especially when you look at Obama,

1676
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:27,510
there's so many people that fucking 
support Obama and don't say God damn 

1677
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:30,271
thing about the shit that he's done in 
comparison to the shit that we're on 

1678
01:19:30,271 --> 01:19:31,360
Bush about the same stuff,
same stuff,

1679
01:19:31,361 --> 01:19:36,361
and all these liberals have proven to be
massive cowards by not coming out 

1680
01:19:36,361 --> 01:19:38,240
against him the way they came out 
against Bush on

1681
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,710
million different things.
They may be.

1682
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:44,350
You have to look at what happens to you 
when you do that.

1683
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:48,850
You know how it works.
Twitter activism as it's called,

1684
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:54,120
it's just character assassination.
You ruined fucking people's lives 

1685
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,190
because their opinion isn't in line with
your sanction opinion that you were paid

1686
01:19:57,191 --> 01:19:59,850
to get out there and lobby.
You know,

1687
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:00,850
I mean,
seriously,

1688
01:20:00,851 --> 01:20:04,600
people's lives are ruined if they stand 
up against power.

1689
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,220
Let's not forget that.

1690
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,000
Oh,
for sure.

1691
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,040
If it's a massive amount of pallets 
after whistleblowers.

1692
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:14,780
Now isn't that fascinating that he,
in his case,

1693
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:19,810
the campaign website,
there was a whole thing about giving 

1694
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:23,340
whistleblowers relief and,
and helping them expose injustices and 

1695
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:26,910
then they yanked all that shit out.
What to say though?

1696
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:30,030
They knew who they knew,
you know?

1697
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,860
What do you think does,
what do you think that is?

1698
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:33,930
Do you think that once you get into 
office they just,

1699
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:38,960
they let you know what the real deal is.
You can talk all that shit you want 

1700
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,421
while you're campaigning,
but once you get into office then you 

1701
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:41,421
find out what the fuck's up.

1702
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,810
You know,
I think it's the system.

1703
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:50,140
The system is what's corrupt,
that people are just stuck in the 

1704
01:20:50,241 --> 01:20:53,450
system.
I think if the system were changed,

1705
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:58,510
if you know,
and it would have to be changed by the 

1706
01:20:58,510 --> 01:20:59,750
people and the People's government,
the people's application of there.

1707
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:03,650
Well that would result in accurate 
government,

1708
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:05,330
you know,
for the people.

1709
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,060
I think,
you know,

1710
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:12,170
I think,
I think without that it will continue to

1711
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:17,290
replicate no matter who's there because 
it's stupid and it doesn't work.

1712
01:21:17,391 --> 01:21:20,810
It's fucking passe.
It's obsolete as time for fucking,

1713
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,440
you know,
to stop defending what's already fucking

1714
01:21:24,441 --> 01:21:27,950
dead so you can yank people and get them
to send you fucking money.

1715
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:32,980
You know,
I think we should just be done with 

1716
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,370
money.
Serious W we don't fucking need money.

1717
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,070
And you know what?
People don't need gold either.

1718
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:42,340
They need water.
So let's make water the new fucking 

1719
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:43,060
currency or something.
Oh,

1720
01:21:43,061 --> 01:21:45,740
let's move away from it.
It ain't that hard.

1721
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,970
It's not that hard to create a fucking 
just economic money system.

1722
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:54,710
It's still have rich fucking people too.
How do you have rich people have this no

1723
01:21:54,711 --> 01:21:56,480
money?
Well,

1724
01:21:56,481 --> 01:21:57,820
you know,
you know,

1725
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,880
you would have other means to create 
Commonwealth and so some people would 

1726
01:22:06,351 --> 01:22:07,250
accrue more,

1727
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,420
but it wasn't about the money when that 
would be necessarily.

1728
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:16,480
I completely agree with you that the 
system is fucked and I think that 

1729
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,280
patching it up is like taking a,
a windows 95 computer and trying to make

1730
01:22:19,441 --> 01:22:24,441
it work in today's Internet and fucking 
adding a bunch of shit to it and 

1731
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:24,570
tweaking.
It's a broken system.

1732
01:22:24,571 --> 01:22:27,390
Throw it out and get a new one.
We're smart enough.

1733
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:31,350
We get enough smart fucking people that 
they can put something better together.

1734
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:35,520
We could do a lot better in a big fat 
fucking hurry if we shut the fuck up and

1735
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:39,460
mind our own God damn business.
Stay home once in a while and uh,

1736
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:42,180
you know,
clean up your own back fucking yard.

1737
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:45,150
What do you think is the best example of
a working government in this,

1738
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:50,410
in this planet?
Is there one country that really stands 

1739
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:50,410
out as really having their shit 
together?

1740
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:55,760
Norway or Sweden.
I'm like an Iceland because I'm always 

1741
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,121
like,
what the fuck am I going to go look 

1742
01:22:59,121 --> 01:22:59,121
around?
But I sign,

1743
01:22:59,121 --> 01:22:59,130
yeah,
because because

1744
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:04,130
they,
they dumped the Fed and then they 

1745
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:08,271
started arresting bankers and doing 
something different and they got richer 

1746
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:11,651
for doing it because they're not 
imposing a system of dead on people 

1747
01:23:11,651 --> 01:23:13,630
there are doing something smarter and 
you know,

1748
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:14,640
I mean,
you know,

1749
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:17,920
I just have hope that that would happen 
here because we could,

1750
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,890
we could nationalize the Federal Reserve
and solve,

1751
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,230
solve all our problems was saved the 
dollar.

1752
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,050
But I mean nobody will frigging do it.

1753
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:26,780
Yeah,
I know.

1754
01:23:26,781 --> 01:23:29,450
I agree with you about Iceland as well.
I think that is also,

1755
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:32,420
if there's an example of a one country 
that can do it,

1756
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:34,820
those are people.
And so that's a better.

1757
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:37,880
That's a clear example that your,
what your statement is,

1758
01:23:37,881 --> 01:23:42,881
that the system is corrupt.
Well that's proof right there because 

1759
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:45,971
you're seeing a system that's not 
corrupt and the people are benefiting 

1760
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:45,971
from it and it's a healthy society.

1761
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:48,290
People,
everything will work just fine.

1762
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:51,260
Everything knows what it's supposed to 
do already.

1763
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,480
If you just get the fucking people that 
are,

1764
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,940
you know,
fucking it up out of the way.

1765
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:58,430
And the best way to get them out of the 
way,

1766
01:23:58,431 --> 01:24:03,431
in my opinion,
is to remind them that they can rejoin 

1767
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:06,671
the human race.
They don't have to be on that other 

1768
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:06,671
side.
And you know,

1769
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:08,840
in that limbo exile thing that I know 
they live in because I've seen it,

1770
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:12,890
they can rejoin it and then fucking come
up with a solution that actually works.

1771
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:18,070
It ain't that fucking hard.
I think people are doing shit like 

1772
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:18,070
grandmas,
all of this world.

1773
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:21,920
They're fixing their community with a 
rubber band and a paperclip.

1774
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:24,680
It's not that fucking hard to have 
everything work.

1775
01:24:24,681 --> 01:24:29,681
Well,
the default position of the universe is 

1776
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:30,830
to the positive.
Everything fucking already knows what to

1777
01:24:30,831 --> 01:24:32,570
do except for,
you know,

1778
01:24:32,571 --> 01:24:36,170
criminals at the top,
a small group of criminals at the top.

1779
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:41,280
I think you're a hundred percent right.
And I think that I like in our society 

1780
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:41,710
that have like an alcoholics 
personality,

1781
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:47,160
someone who's trapped in a terrible 
pattern keeps repeating the same 

1782
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:50,131
problems over and over again and 
drinking and driving and know just 

1783
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:53,701
fucking killing their body.
I think that that probably is how our 

1784
01:24:53,701 --> 01:24:57,301
society is,
that we've got addicted to the idea of 

1785
01:24:57,301 --> 01:25:00,001
extracting money out of this broken 
system to the point where people are so 

1786
01:25:00,001 --> 01:25:01,060
addicted to money and so addicted to the
benefits of having it,

1787
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,650
that they're not willing to say,
hey,

1788
01:25:02,651 --> 01:25:07,651
you know,
I'm a part of something that's 

1789
01:25:07,651 --> 01:25:07,651
ultimately destructive even to me and to
my children.

1790
01:25:07,651 --> 01:25:10,150
That gambling mentality,
this people think they're.

1791
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:12,550
If people think they're getting 
something for nothing,

1792
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:16,110
that's like the greatest frigging drug.
They,

1793
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:22,150
they disguise what it is,
but it's thinking you're going to get 

1794
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:22,330
more than everybody else.

1795
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:25,340
That's so true that they'd love.
People love getting over,

1796
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,600
don't they?
They love it.

1797
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:31,630
They love getting over.
I have a friend that will like try to 

1798
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:31,970
get bargains on fucking everything and 
I'm like,

1799
01:25:31,971 --> 01:25:33,290
dude,
you have money.

1800
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:35,330
Like why are you haggling over,
you know,

1801
01:25:35,331 --> 01:25:38,840
an extra $20 off or something or $5 off 
or whatever the fuck it is.

1802
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,510
Because I like getting over.
I just like getting over.

1803
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,310
He goes,
if I can get it for free,

1804
01:25:43,311 --> 01:25:45,680
I'd want to get it for free.
Like people want to get free and they're

1805
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:46,770
rich.
They do.

1806
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,360
They want that thrill of figuring out 
how I got rich.

1807
01:25:50,361 --> 01:25:55,361
So I know firsthand how it works on you.
I know exactly how it works on you,

1808
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,660
I'm sure.
Yeah.

1809
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:58,190
Well,
and it works on you.

1810
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,680
It does tell there's,
you know,

1811
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:04,040
there's nothing left of you.
And that's a

1812
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,810
hard.
That's a hard thing.

1813
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,840
That's hard when you can't fucking 
stomach get no more,

1814
01:26:08,841 --> 01:26:10,190
but then you can let go,
oh,

1815
01:26:10,191 --> 01:26:11,750
I'm going to not do that no more.

1816
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:15,820
You was,
it hard going from like not having money

1817
01:26:15,821 --> 01:26:20,821
to be in like one of the richest women 
in the history of Hollywood over a 

1818
01:26:20,821 --> 01:26:22,210
period the world over a period of how 
many years?

1819
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,910
Uh,
three years.

1820
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:29,970
That's insane isn't it?
Was fucking charging right away.

1821
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:35,790
When I first came to La,
my first night there,

1822
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,790
like they saw me that I got a TV show 
the first night there.

1823
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:45,630
Then I got the tonight show,
then I got a Julio Iglesias tour that 

1824
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:49,480
was 10 times the money my husband worked
in the Boston office ever made.

1825
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:50,670
So,
you know,

1826
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,560
I mean,
it was chaching right from the get go in

1827
01:26:53,561 --> 01:26:54,970
La dream come true,
you know?

1828
01:26:55,430 --> 01:27:00,430
Wow.
And you were one of the old school 

1829
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,681
comedy store gangsters till you came up 
in the era where things were probably 

1830
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:06,740
one of the most powerful errors in the 
history of standup comedy.

1831
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:10,890
If you go back and look at like the 
origins from Lenny Bruce Harland,

1832
01:27:10,891 --> 01:27:15,891
to what have you,
your era of the comedy store is one of 

1833
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:15,891
the most powerful areas ever.

1834
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:16,950
Yeah,
it has.

1835
01:27:16,951 --> 01:27:19,020
But there was one that proceeded me 
that,

1836
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:20,460
that was the one where,
um,

1837
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,670
you know,
they had the strike and all the comics.

1838
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,320
I mean,
there was a like,

1839
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,840
oh,
David Steinberg and you know,

1840
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:30,810
those guys,
they're like in their seventies,

1841
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:33,750
late seventies now.
But a whole bunch of guys like that.

1842
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:34,770
Um,
Oh God,

1843
01:27:34,771 --> 01:27:36,810
I'm so bad on names.
I remember us.

1844
01:27:36,811 --> 01:27:41,811
But you know,
I'm a whole Elayne boosler just a little

1845
01:27:42,451 --> 01:27:43,620
bit before me.
They,

1846
01:27:43,621 --> 01:27:45,900
they were the ones that created it broke
down,

1847
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,750
you know?
So they did great work.

1848
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:49,650
Great.
Yeah.

1849
01:27:49,651 --> 01:27:52,830
For folks who don't know,
the way La Works is,

1850
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:58,070
for the longest time nobody got paid.
You would go up and you would do spots 

1851
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:02,301
and the clubs,
would it be packed every night and the 

1852
01:28:02,301 --> 01:28:04,371
comedians will be starving to death,
especially the local ones that are just 

1853
01:28:04,371 --> 01:28:04,830
sorta start now,
but they would be providing,

1854
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:08,250
providing all this entertainment but not
sharing any of the profit.

1855
01:28:08,251 --> 01:28:13,251
And this,
the comedy clubs weren't willing to 

1856
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:13,251
budge.
They,

1857
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:13,251
they were like,
look,

1858
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:14,910
this is the way it is.
There was a book that is written on it,

1859
01:28:14,911 --> 01:28:19,911
right?
Irish should fear was reading it 

1860
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:19,911
recently.
I forget what it's called.

1861
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:20,580
See what you find that Jimmy.
Um,

1862
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,630
but the,
uh,

1863
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:25,200
the strike itself was,
was very important and now comedians get

1864
01:28:25,201 --> 01:28:28,680
paid for their sets.
It's kind of weird that they would think

1865
01:28:28,681 --> 01:28:33,681
that it would be okay to have people 
perform and you profit off them 

1866
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:34,320
performing,
but you keep all the money.

1867
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,530
Well,
we saw that in Denver too.

1868
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:40,190
We had a,
we had a little club there and everybody

1869
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:44,060
worked for free.
And the owner's like,

1870
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:48,200
start buying second homes and you know,
I'm dying up here.

1871
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:50,520
That's the name of the book.
Oh yeah,

1872
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,540
I have that.
You know,

1873
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:57,610
when you see the owner who's another 
comic and he's buying a second house and

1874
01:28:57,681 --> 01:28:58,160
uh,
you know,

1875
01:28:58,161 --> 01:29:03,161
adding on to the club,
you're like any still doing time on 

1876
01:29:03,161 --> 01:29:03,161
Monday

1877
01:29:03,161 --> 01:29:04,140
on.
He's still working in the club,

1878
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:06,990
you know,
I mean they think they're doing you some

1879
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:09,330
good by letting you performed.
That's what they said to us.

1880
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,010
More like,
you know what you're going to pay.

1881
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,680
And because they won in La,
they did.

1882
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,420
So it went all across.
It went all across the country that,

1883
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:22,650
that ripple of that.
But the idea behind is pretty fucking 

1884
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:26,151
gross.
And you know the adjust because the 

1885
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:28,311
comics are benefiting from it.
What you're not like that is your whole 

1886
01:29:28,311 --> 01:29:31,431
business.
Well that's profit sharing again and 

1887
01:29:31,431 --> 01:29:31,830
commonwealth and all that same stuff at 
any club owner that will do,

1888
01:29:31,831 --> 01:29:36,831
that's a piece of shit.
And he club owner that wouldn't want to 

1889
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:36,831
compensate the comedians that are 
performing from.

1890
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:39,420
I actually think that you're going to 
get them to work for free while you have

1891
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:41,310
your place packed every fucking night.

1892
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,920
It's disgusting.
Like you don't feel they're going to get

1893
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:45,240
a lot out or they're going to get 
famous,

1894
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,280
you know,
that's like all artists in Hollywood 

1895
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,430
know.
I mean anybody who can put two words 

1896
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:52,430
together,
you know,

1897
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:56,660
they,
they'd rather not pay you a dime of 

1898
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:56,850
writers,
musicians,

1899
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,290
songwriters,
you know,

1900
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:01,170
they want to own everything now.
They got their copyright laws,

1901
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:03,200
they want on everything.
Some people do,

1902
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,990
but there's one of the beautiful things 
about small clubs that I've always loved

1903
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:07,840
to,
you know,

1904
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:10,260
if I'll do like xannies in Nashville or 
something like that.

1905
01:30:10,261 --> 01:30:12,450
It's like the club owners,
if you go to these places,

1906
01:30:12,451 --> 01:30:14,870
like they actually liked the art form.
They will.

1907
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,220
It's a good exchange.
They enjoy it,

1908
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,330
you know,
the,

1909
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:23,360
the,
the enjoy the idea of having performers 

1910
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,470
on the stage and the people have a good 
time and that their business flourishes.

1911
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,330
They're happy to pay you.
Well,

1912
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:32,331
you know,
there's a lot of great comics out there 

1913
01:30:32,331 --> 01:30:34,281
getting old now and you know,
they don't have any money and there's a 

1914
01:30:34,281 --> 01:30:38,520
bunch of shit like that.
They gave their whole lives for comedy 

1915
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:38,980
and they didn't get rich like I did,
you know,

1916
01:30:38,981 --> 01:30:41,360
and a few of us,
but they're just as you know,

1917
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,770
they're great writers,
great comics,

1918
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:46,560
but you know,
you get broke down by that system,

1919
01:30:46,561 --> 01:30:49,680
like all artists and creative people do 
well.

1920
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:51,250
I think we're a lot of these guys too 
though.

1921
01:30:51,251 --> 01:30:53,290
They're also very,
woe is me as a quote.

1922
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,800
Quite a few of those guys that never 
figured out social media,

1923
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:57,360
they never figured out how to promote 
themselves.

1924
01:30:57,361 --> 01:30:59,400
They stop writing new material and then 
they,

1925
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,710
they feel like I've been doing standup 
for 30 years.

1926
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:02,820
I can't sell at a club.
Well,

1927
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,990
well,
what did you do?

1928
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,490
I mean like what did you do with your 
time?

1929
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:10,491
Like how much of your time did you 
actually invest in continuing your 

1930
01:31:10,491 --> 01:31:13,191
career?
How much of your time did you actually 

1931
01:31:13,191 --> 01:31:13,590
invest in writing and how much did you 
just think that it was just due to you?

1932
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:17,820
Because you've been around for 30 years.
I thought it was just due to me.

1933
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:21,060
You sound like my representatives now.
Well,

1934
01:31:21,061 --> 01:31:22,140
for you,
you know you.

1935
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:27,370
I've said it before the show,
but I'll say it afterwards so other 

1936
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:27,600
people could hear.
We were talking recently about 10 of the

1937
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:32,601
most influential comedians of all time 
and you are our list and I appreciate 

1938
01:31:32,601 --> 01:31:32,601
that.
Thank you.

1939
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,280
It's 100 percent true.
It's an honor to have you on the show.

1940
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,890
In fact,
I think that you came along and you were

1941
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:42,120
this new type of woman stand up in the 
ways.

1942
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:46,350
Even more powerful than kinison was as a
male standup.

1943
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,800
You came along and you had this whole 
new thing going on and you were a woman 

1944
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,401
who didn't give a fuck.
Like you don't give a fuck what anybody 

1945
01:31:55,401 --> 01:31:58,281
says.
You gotTa fucking tell him and he's 

1946
01:31:58,281 --> 01:31:58,281
going to say like,
shut the fuck up.

1947
01:31:58,281 --> 01:32:00,340
This is what I feel.
This is my fucking

1948
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:01,120
husband.
And you would.

1949
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:06,620
You were slaying with this material 
because nobody had ever seen that 

1950
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:10,651
before.
I remember thing was my mom who told me 

1951
01:32:10,651 --> 01:32:12,640
about you pretty sure.
I'm pretty sure it was my mom because my

1952
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,070
mom,
she likes to stay in her sixties.

1953
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,980
Yes.
And she likes stand up and uh,

1954
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:20,600
I think she was,
I'm almost positive it was her,

1955
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:21,880
but she's like,
you gotta see this woman?

1956
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:24,820
Oh my God.
She made me laugh like no woman has ever

1957
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:26,920
made me laugh.
But that statement,

1958
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:29,780
like it was a different kind of a thing.
Like she said it that way.

1959
01:32:29,781 --> 01:32:34,781
I mean she was just,
just trying to say how much he enjoyed 

1960
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:34,781
it,
but that was a true statement.

1961
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:39,211
Like she made you laugh in a way that 
you never laughed at a woman comic 

1962
01:32:39,211 --> 01:32:39,550
before you just,
you owned it.

1963
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,400
Were a lot of these women who came 
before you.

1964
01:32:42,401 --> 01:32:47,401
Although we're very funny.
They wanted people to like them and you 

1965
01:32:47,401 --> 01:32:49,160
were like,
fuck you guys.

1966
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:51,000
I learned it.
I mean,

1967
01:32:51,001 --> 01:32:52,770
you know,
I learned that on stage.

1968
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:57,830
I'll tell Ya.
I did learn a lot of it from my dad 

1969
01:32:57,830 --> 01:33:00,770
because my dad was just like that.
He was like one of the funniest ones 

1970
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:00,840
ever.
Really?

1971
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,760
Yeah.
But he had to get a job,

1972
01:33:02,761 --> 01:33:03,900
you know,
because he had kids.

1973
01:33:03,901 --> 01:33:05,430
So,
but uh,

1974
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:06,860
and he did some funny,
funny,

1975
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:11,980
did you stand up nowhere near the house 
and when people called Israel always had

1976
01:33:14,641 --> 01:33:19,641
the mormons.
We lived in Salt Lake in the Mormons 

1977
01:33:19,641 --> 01:33:19,710
always came to our house to teach us 
about,

1978
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:23,850
you know,
the book of Mormon and my mom was a nice

1979
01:33:23,851 --> 01:33:28,851
woman so she always let a man and I 
guess you want somebody to talk to or 

1980
01:33:28,851 --> 01:33:30,240
whatever it plus they were handsome as 
hell.

1981
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:34,170
And my mom's like that pretty girl 
always.

1982
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:37,440
So she's like,
when she was 70 she like,

1983
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:41,310
I can still get a man.
Whoa man.

1984
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:44,760
Whoa.
So that's why I'm so neurotic because.

1985
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,030
So she would invite a man.
And so my dad,

1986
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,940
he didn't like him because he was an 
atheist.

1987
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:55,530
So he used to go down the basement and 
scream up a bar.

1988
01:33:55,590 --> 01:34:00,590
The better thing he did was when they 
knock on the door after they'd been 

1989
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:00,590
there a couple times.
He goes,

1990
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:02,280
Mrs Barr in?
And he goes,

1991
01:34:02,281 --> 01:34:06,810
Mrs Barr,
Mrs Barr is in jail for 28 days.

1992
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:14,240
We have nothing to discuss it and we ask
kids are just wouldn't be pee in our 

1993
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:16,240
pants.

1994
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:19,260
So who does do that to fuck with people 
to entertain?

1995
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:20,040
He,
uh,

1996
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:21,690
the heart of a standup,
right?

1997
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,870
Yeah.
Plus his lines were pretty good too.

1998
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:25,730
Yeah,
he was funny.

1999
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:28,280
My whole family was funny.
It was all slams.

2000
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:29,930
Every slamming,
everybody.

2001
01:34:29,931 --> 01:34:34,931
I got the first slam when I was four.
My uncle Sherman was sitting there 

2002
01:34:34,931 --> 01:34:38,380
eating my grandma's soup and he always 
called her a greenhorn,

2003
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:41,240
the self care.
She was an immigrant and so he's like,

2004
01:34:41,241 --> 01:34:46,241
you know,
in America they don't put an inch of 

2005
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:49,270
chicken fat on top of their soap.
I was like four and I think he's talking

2006
01:34:50,511 --> 01:34:54,920
about by grandma and I really want to 
film this too because I felt like wonder

2007
01:34:54,921 --> 01:34:56,870
woman and I knew I was going to deliver 
the.

2008
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:57,960
It

2009
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,870
came to me and I was going to do it,
you know,

2010
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,990
that thing you get when you a comic.
And I'm like,

2011
01:35:02,991 --> 01:35:06,430
then how come you eat two bowls of it?
Boom.

2012
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:11,910
And,
and everyone laughed and he got really 

2013
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:11,960
pissed that I was only four,
but he got pissed.

2014
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:13,880
So then I was like,
oh boy,

2015
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:20,110
I can own this room.
So you remember the first time you ever 

2016
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:20,300
killed?
Yeah,

2017
01:35:20,301 --> 01:35:22,520
I do.
I do.

2018
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:27,540
I remember every section you just 
knocked out of the park and you had the 

2019
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:31,541
feeling that you get when you go on 
stage and you have an idea because he 

2020
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:33,260
was fat and no one could say he was fat.
They couldn't say,

2021
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:38,261
hey,
you're a tub or anything like that to 

2022
01:35:38,261 --> 01:35:38,550
him because he was sensitive.
But he was a bully.

2023
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:41,120
Like a lot of fat people are bullies,
you know,

2024
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:44,900
they're not all jolly well there's a lot
of fat people that are uncomfortable,

2025
01:35:44,901 --> 01:35:45,140
right?

2026
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:46,070
Yeah.
Whatever.

2027
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:47,810
But they're mean and he's the one of 
them.

2028
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:50,420
So I was like,
you're eating too much.

2029
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:55,830
UHM,
it was like double and I knew it was 

2030
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:59,450
fucking Delta because it was like I was,
I was penetrating the shield of 

2031
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:04,001
bullshit.
We don't tell him he fucking is a big 

2032
01:36:04,001 --> 01:36:04,520
fat pig.
The best comedy law.

2033
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:06,020
It's so fun.
Missile.

2034
01:36:06,021 --> 01:36:09,260
A hell fire missile that penetrates the 
shield of bullshit.

2035
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:14,600
The bad thing is when you are like that,
like me and my dad given it back.

2036
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:18,110
Then you have kids and they give it to 
you and the God damn it.

2037
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:20,210
It's awful.
My kid already gives it to her.

2038
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:25,510
How long have a five and a three.
The five year olds already like talk 

2039
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:27,790
shit.
It's so you're covering.

2040
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:30,890
It's totally.
I told her she had to go to bed.

2041
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:31,270
She goes,
well,

2042
01:36:31,271 --> 01:36:31,940
I don't have a job.

2043
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:38,290
She just looked at me,
was say daddy has to get up in the 

2044
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:38,290
morning.
That has a job.

2045
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:43,241
I got to go to sleep zone.
So when I tell her she got to go to 

2046
01:36:43,241 --> 01:36:43,241
sleep.
She was like,

2047
01:36:43,241 --> 01:36:43,460
well,
I don't know what job being just looking

2048
01:36:43,461 --> 01:36:43,940
at me.
I was like,

2049
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:48,970
Oh snap.
This is before she was even going to 

2050
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:48,970
preschool.
She was four when she said that,

2051
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:53,120
I know it's happening.
I know it's coming,

2052
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:58,430
but that's no way around it.
Karma and no parent escapes it.

2053
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,800
I enjoy it.
I wanted to be.

2054
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:06,010
I want her to be strong.
I want her to have her own opinions and 

2055
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:09,170
I mean the arguing about whether or not 
she should have to go to bed is the 

2056
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:13,241
beginning of arguing whether or not she 
should have a terrible job arguing 

2057
01:37:13,241 --> 01:37:14,860
whether she should have an existence 
that she doesn't enjoy,

2058
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:19,930
whether she should have been in a 
relationship that you think sucks to 

2059
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:20,870
said.
Got a good point.

2060
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:22,220
I said,
well,

2061
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:25,160
yeah.
I mean I told her go to bed.

2062
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:25,790
No,
no.

2063
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:29,000
I made her watch one more half hour of 
Max and Ruby and then go to bed.

2064
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:30,610
Give her 30 minutes.

2065
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:37,900
I didn't tell her that the line deserves
reward because I didn't want her to be 

2066
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:38,510
encouraged to continue it,
but I just had explained it to her.

2067
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:43,511
I said,
it's so important when you're young to 

2068
01:37:43,511 --> 01:37:43,511
get your sleep.
I go,

2069
01:37:43,511 --> 01:37:44,360
because you're a growing organism,
you know,

2070
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:49,430
so I tried to explain like,
showed her some pictures when she was a 

2071
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:49,430
baby.
I said,

2072
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:50,480
you see what you look like now or you 
don't look like that anymore.

2073
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:55,510
That's all from sleep.
That sleep turns you from a baby into 

2074
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:55,980
this four year old girl.
Can Talk to me.

2075
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:56,850
She was like,
really?

2076
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:57,390
I go,
Yup.

2077
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,700
I go,
it's thinking and it's learning.

2078
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:01,680
That's all important too.
But sleep is big.

2079
01:38:01,681 --> 01:38:03,030
It's really important.
I go,

2080
01:38:03,031 --> 01:38:05,400
but it's not going to hurt you if you 
watch one more show.

2081
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:07,180
So we'll watch one more.
Good Dad.

2082
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,870
It's so.
It's so important that girls have a good

2083
01:38:09,871 --> 01:38:12,960
dad that they can talk to.
Girls need that more.

2084
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:14,670
More than anything.
I think so.

2085
01:38:14,671 --> 01:38:16,650
And it's important for God to have a 
good mom.

2086
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,830
You know,
something funny.

2087
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:21,300
My Dad said,
I,

2088
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:22,530
we are Jews,
you know,

2089
01:38:22,531 --> 01:38:23,730
in Salt Lake.
And I said,

2090
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:28,910
I was like,
how come Santa doesn't come to our 

2091
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:28,910
house?
I was like,

2092
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:31,950
I was about eight,
maybe six.

2093
01:38:31,951 --> 01:38:34,530
How come?
How come it doesn't come over our house?

2094
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,620
Because Santa is an antisemite.

2095
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,420
It was so funny.
Horrible thing for a kid to hear.

2096
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:50,830
It was hilarious.
You already knew you enjoyed it.

2097
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:54,180
You were like,
are raised to be a comic essentially.

2098
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:57,660
He used to watch Ed Sullivan with me,
you know,

2099
01:38:57,661 --> 01:38:59,730
and he'd go,
this guy is a,

2100
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,860
he's a comic.
He says,

2101
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:02,620
you know,
he's,

2102
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:04,380
he goes,
this guy's a comedian.

2103
01:39:04,381 --> 01:39:06,510
He,
he says things funny.

2104
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,850
This guy is a comic.
He says,

2105
01:39:08,851 --> 01:39:10,620
funny things.
He told me,

2106
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,210
he broke it all down for me.
He goes,

2107
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,860
this guy is actively resisting.
This guy has a resistor.

2108
01:39:16,861 --> 01:39:18,590
This guy is a,
um,

2109
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:22,750
what do you call it,
where you collude because he has,

2110
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:25,170
you know,
he was like a big fucking commy.

2111
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:28,660
Your Dad was a big comedy.
Yeah.

2112
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:31,350
Well,
you know,

2113
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:33,750
he grew up during the McCarthy era,
which,

2114
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:38,770
I mean,
you want it to be a comic because you 

2115
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:38,770
didn't want to be the fucking government
usually thought that was good.

2116
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:41,430
The opposite side when you've got these 
people that are getting arrested because

2117
01:39:41,431 --> 01:39:43,980
they went to a meeting and talk to 
people about socialism.

2118
01:39:43,981 --> 01:39:46,890
So they're getting arrested and they're 
getting blacklisted from Hollywood.

2119
01:39:46,891 --> 01:39:50,400
They getting their fucking jobs taken 
away from them for going to meetings and

2120
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:55,401
talking to people about ideas.
That blacklisting thing and the left 

2121
01:39:57,541 --> 01:40:02,541
joins in on it.
If you'll notice that the left joins in 

2122
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:02,541
on the,
on,

2123
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:04,210
like I was pretty shocked that they were
coming after him.

2124
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:09,510
You know,
the Times that they've come after me 

2125
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:11,301
because you didn't understand a couple 
of times I've said stupid things and uh,

2126
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:13,410
oh,
I'm not getting into it.

2127
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:15,300
You don't get into it.

2128
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,370
Why would I do that?
Just as an example.

2129
01:40:17,371 --> 01:40:19,530
So if people don't know that are 
listening to this,

2130
01:40:19,531 --> 01:40:20,950
they would like to know what you mean 
by.

2131
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,280
Well,
because me,

2132
01:40:23,281 --> 01:40:26,040
I don't know.
I got in a fight with the transgenders,

2133
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:29,000
the transgenders.
What was it about all of them?

2134
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,700
Not all of them.
The majority of them are,

2135
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:35,250
are Nice,
wonderful people.

2136
01:40:35,251 --> 01:40:37,620
They really are.
And I know a lot of them,

2137
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:39,870
but you know,
assholes are in every group.

2138
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,480
What you were talking about tribalism.
Here's no family.

2139
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:46,560
Say when they pervert tribalism and 
here's what they do too.

2140
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:49,980
They make him defend everybody who's 
like you,

2141
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:54,130
but that's not good because you're the 
Predator right

2142
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,000
there.
Sure.

2143
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,940
The Predator is the one every group 
should be against.

2144
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:01,720
It is time to read every community,
every type,

2145
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:06,810
every,
every street of predators who liked aid 

2146
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:10,770
people taking people's money,
taking public money and putting it in 

2147
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:10,930
private pockets,
right?

2148
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:11,820
Yes.
I agree.

2149
01:41:11,821 --> 01:41:15,270
One hundred percent is saying that all 
people have this nationality,

2150
01:41:15,271 --> 01:41:17,490
those are my people or all people with 
this gender.

2151
01:41:17,491 --> 01:41:20,760
Those are my people or all people that 
are transgender are my people.

2152
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:26,050
It's all equally ridiculous.
Everybody's got households in their 

2153
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:26,930
group.
Just be anti asshole would be.

2154
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:32,070
I could not agree more and that has 
always been my problem with the idea of 

2155
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:32,070
feminism.
You know,

2156
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:36,720
like I'm 100 percent for equality for 
and I think that we should look down on 

2157
01:41:37,171 --> 01:41:42,171
men who were abusing women the same way 
we look down on women abusing men the 

2158
01:41:42,171 --> 01:41:45,690
same way we look at men abusing men the 
same way we look at women abusing women.

2159
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:49,320
It's a gross thing that humans do where 
they victimize each other.

2160
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:54,330
That's exactly right.
And there should be one fucking way to 

2161
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:56,991
go.
One law for everybody that gets rid of 

2162
01:41:56,991 --> 01:41:56,991
all that,
rest of that shit.

2163
01:41:56,991 --> 01:41:59,400
They just fundraising again that these 
fucking people,

2164
01:41:59,401 --> 01:42:00,390
they're fundraising.

2165
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:01,430
Well,
it could be that.

2166
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:03,580
It's also the need to be,
you know,

2167
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:05,710
you're not on my team.
Fuck you.

2168
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:07,700
This people that are only team,
att and t,

2169
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,360
what are you going with?
Rosen.

2170
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,310
Oh,
you're using a windows computer.

2171
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:13,810
You push.
You need to get a Mac.

2172
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:14,860
You know,
people are crazy.

2173
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:17,920
They're crazy with that.
They're getting paid to do that though.

2174
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,250
That's a natural.
Oh,

2175
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,840
they absolutely do.
They have,

2176
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:25,030
I think almost all do this fucking 
Chevy.

2177
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:28,630
People that have a car,
they have the Calvin and Hobbes of a,

2178
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:33,640
uh,
Calvin pissing on a Ford logo because 

2179
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:33,640
they don't like for

2180
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:37,150
people retarded.
They just go with these stupid team.

2181
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:42,151
I'm from Milwaukee.
We don't give a fuck about being from 

2182
01:42:42,151 --> 01:42:45,151
Chicago.
That's a statement that a person in 

2183
01:42:45,151 --> 01:42:48,991
Milwaukee is likely to say.
If you bring up Chicago Patrick 

2184
01:42:48,991 --> 01:42:49,660
mentality,
it's,

2185
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:52,530
it's,
it's a natural thing.

2186
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:55,400
It's being taught.
I'm not going to agree with you.

2187
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:59,800
That's why I don't have any.
You do have hope?

2188
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:04,830
I do,
but I have a different kind of hope 

2189
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:05,920
because my hopes based on my helping 
other human beings.

2190
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:07,510
So as is mine,
as his mom,

2191
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:12,620
I don't have like any umbrella fucking 
hope that the right thing is going to 

2192
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,080
happen as people are fucking stupid.
That's what they are.

2193
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:17,740
They're stupid in their followers and 
they are too busy to think,

2194
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,960
but they're also beautiful and 
brilliant.

2195
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:25,080
The reason why we're having this 
conversation at all is because someone 

2196
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,481
figured out a way to put all this 
electronics shit into this tube that's 

2197
01:43:27,481 --> 01:43:30,940
only like six inches long and then it's 
attached to this wire that's attached to

2198
01:43:30,941 --> 01:43:35,941
a fucking computer as a distribution 
vehicle for information than I would 

2199
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:39,090
have never been able to figure out on 
my.

2200
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:40,060
Okay,
wait a minute.

2201
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:42,040
I want to say you're changing the 
subject.

2202
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:47,220
I want to say this.
I don't believe that people are fucked 

2203
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,460
up.
I don't believe that they have,

2204
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:51,340
that they are a slave to their worst 
impulses.

2205
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,660
I don't.
I think some are more,

2206
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:57,320
but I think the majority of people are 
not like that.

2207
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,950
I think the majority of people are 
actually good,

2208
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:06,010
but they are for people kept away from 
the seats of power and if we could just 

2209
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:08,240
get one.
One of them somewhere,

2210
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:11,000
anywhere,
Yemen,

2211
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:15,430
anywhere one of them will will,
will change it.

2212
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:18,770
Everything.
Just one intelligent person.

2213
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:19,590
I,
I,

2214
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:24,050
I think one intelligent person can reach
all intelligence,

2215
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:28,310
even in the greediest lowest a backward 
bastard on earth.

2216
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:30,960
I think you're 100 percent right.
I also think that that noise is going to

2217
01:44:30,961 --> 01:44:32,580
drive people crazy.
What is that?

2218
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:36,240
Is that you banging on this thing?
Someone next door to someone next door.

2219
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:41,660
What are they doing?
They're making something that's loud as 

2220
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:46,550
fuck.
They're probably are listening to the 

2221
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:47,470
podcast and they hate me banging on my 
door because they know it's next door.

2222
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,380
They have cake.
Maybe it's a CIA,

2223
01:44:49,381 --> 01:44:54,381
setting up a listening station.
How many good people there are in our 

2224
01:44:54,381 --> 01:44:58,520
government and people report this to me.
I just want to say this to people.

2225
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:00,590
They do report to me that there,

2226
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:05,710
there are good people everywhere.
I'm sure there's good people in our 

2227
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:10,091
government and they're like,
right now they're proving that because 

2228
01:45:10,311 --> 01:45:13,850
of they had solutions that made common 
sense to people.

2229
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:19,060
They're being promoted and getting 
closer to a logical seats of power.

2230
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:21,800
So I think that

2231
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:26,980
good to,
well I think that this is what I was 

2232
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:26,980
saying when I did the Internet and that 
the,

2233
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:31,890
the transparency of information that we 
have today is going to sort of reinforce

2234
01:45:32,151 --> 01:45:34,250
those ideas.
If you're going to represent people,

2235
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,670
you have to represent them in a way that
benefits the people and that's possible.

2236
01:45:37,671 --> 01:45:39,770
It's possible to do so.
Uh,

2237
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:41,510
we're,
we're both on the same page.

2238
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:44,220
Just a little more extreme than me.
Yeah.

2239
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:49,490
Chem trails and stuff.
And Mk Ultra and aliens.

2240
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:54,630
That's where you draw the line I think.
I think there might be row.

2241
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:59,680
I think there might be robots.
I think the news might all be 

2242
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:02,600
manufactured outside,
that's pretty sure in a studio.

2243
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:07,650
And.
And they probably have lookalikes 

2244
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:07,650
playing the party.

2245
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:09,650
Did you see wag the dog?
Yes,

2246
01:46:09,651 --> 01:46:10,380
I did.
It was.

2247
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:12,290
And that was a long time ago,
by the way,

2248
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,560
before they had the kind of CGI that 
they have today.

2249
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:21,090
Well,
I think they're definitely fake some 

2250
01:46:21,090 --> 01:46:22,541
stuff.
The CIA printed in the paper during the 

2251
01:46:22,541 --> 01:46:23,330
beginning of the Iraq invasion that they
were going to release fake stories.

2252
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:28,480
It was on CNN,
they were going to release fake stories 

2253
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:28,480
for the good of,
you know,

2254
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,120
uh,
the troops or whatever the fuck it was,

2255
01:46:29,121 --> 01:46:34,121
you know,
like that's it when you're admitting 

2256
01:46:34,121 --> 01:46:34,160
them,
destroying their records,

2257
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:39,670
that's what people who believe the tower
seven thing was the tower seven 

2258
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:43,630
confusion or I'm a conspiracy rather,
is that there was so much evidence 

2259
01:46:44,121 --> 01:46:49,121
inside that building that could have 
fucked them bank stuff and Ron and ron 

2260
01:46:49,121 --> 01:46:50,010
stuff and it was the

2261
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:54,330
CIA had offices in that building.
The NSA had offices in that building.

2262
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,820
That building was a crazy fucking 
building of information and shit.

2263
01:46:57,860 --> 01:47:01,740
That was the black male center maybe.
I don't know what the fuck it was,

2264
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:05,960
but I know that that building imploded.
Lucky it was detonated those,

2265
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,100
those other two buildings to me look 
like buildings.

2266
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:13,101
I got hit by a plane and horrible 
structural damage and everything fell 

2267
01:47:13,101 --> 01:47:13,740
because they failed the way something 
would fall.

2268
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:18,770
It was collapsing and falling apart.
That tower seven thing felt like it was 

2269
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:19,710
a controlled demolition.
Now,

2270
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:24,770
obviously I'm not an engineer,
nor I'm an architect or a construction 

2271
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:28,371
expert,
so I don't know if a fire could make a 

2272
01:47:28,371 --> 01:47:29,760
building do that.
It might be able to because look,

2273
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:31,720
the things or weird things,
it's.

2274
01:47:31,721 --> 01:47:34,050
It's weird to be able to detonate a 
building in the first place.

2275
01:47:34,051 --> 01:47:35,960
It's weird when you see,
you know,

2276
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:41,060
sometimes shit happens.
Sometimes things don't go the way you 

2277
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:41,570
would think they would go through lack 
of management.

2278
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:46,330
There is a of what they think it is.
It's like people are swimming in theory.

2279
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:46,930
Yeah.
Well,

2280
01:47:46,931 --> 01:47:48,490
it's one of those things.
It's so.

2281
01:47:48,491 --> 01:47:53,491
It's,
it's also so enticing to believe that 

2282
01:47:53,491 --> 01:47:56,331
tower seven was the place where they 
were holding all this information and 

2283
01:47:56,331 --> 01:47:57,280
they detonated in front of everybody's 
eyes on television.

2284
01:47:57,281 --> 01:47:59,650
Like Holy Shit.
They got away with it because it's,

2285
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:04,890
you know,
if you were inclined to lean towards 

2286
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:04,890
that,
that would be one of the possibilities.

2287
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:06,180
The reality is,
I don't know.

2288
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,830
I,
here's what I got out of it.

2289
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:09,210
Okay,
well get here.

2290
01:48:09,211 --> 01:48:10,610
We can watch it.
We get to watch it fall.

2291
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:12,990
Okay,
I'll get that five seconds.

2292
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:16,330
Watch it again.
Play that,

2293
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:17,880
play that again,
because it's,

2294
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,510
it's anybody that says it's not weird.
Is hilarious.

2295
01:48:21,770 --> 01:48:24,330
Office is that seven,
whatever it is,

2296
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:29,331
it's free fall speed.
That's one of the things that they did 

2297
01:48:29,331 --> 01:48:29,490
prove and they tried to argue it,
which is hilarious.

2298
01:48:29,491 --> 01:48:32,700
The nist guys tried to argue that it 
wasn't free fall speed.

2299
01:48:32,701 --> 01:48:33,780
They tried to say that,
uh,

2300
01:48:33,781 --> 01:48:36,040
it was like a second slower than free.
False.

2301
01:48:36,041 --> 01:48:38,700
Be like you're talking about the 
collapse of a building.

2302
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,940
Like even if it's a second flow is 
slower than free fall speed.

2303
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:47,090
That's fucking crazy.
That thing just imploded into its own 

2304
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:48,450
base.
Watch it one more time.

2305
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,010
Look at that.
Ooh,

2306
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:52,680
look how it does that.
Anybody that doesn't think that's nuts.

2307
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:53,570
Your nut.

2308
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:58,680
That's the set there.
You know how when they go like this on 

2309
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,040
the side and they take it down?

2310
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,090
Yeah.
Like the,

2311
01:49:02,091 --> 01:49:02,650
the,
yeah,

2312
01:49:02,651 --> 01:49:07,651
the set and uh,
on a screen or a stage for a play 

2313
01:49:07,651 --> 01:49:07,651
people,

2314
01:49:07,651 --> 01:49:10,020
except for the people who survived on 
the streets.

2315
01:49:10,021 --> 01:49:13,320
The horror of that.
That's really what it was about.

2316
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:18,350
I thought.
But also the thing I knew it was the 

2317
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:20,871
fucking end of the world when I say that
because it was like I couldn't believe 

2318
01:49:20,871 --> 01:49:25,131
it because all these guys in suits,
they were lined up on the sides of the 

2319
01:49:26,371 --> 01:49:31,371
roads and they were applauding for the 
firemen and the workers who do the 

2320
01:49:31,371 --> 01:49:34,410
actual work and they were like handing 
them water and I went,

2321
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:39,440
this is the fucking end of the world.
Americans are actually like applauding 

2322
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:44,181
the way things actually work.
The guys in the suits or actually 

2323
01:49:44,181 --> 01:49:46,770
applauding the first responders and 
stuff.

2324
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,090
I thought this has got

2325
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:50,800
to be that.
This is the hand of the bullshit.

2326
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:53,380
Just bullshit.
Met the touch,

2327
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:56,350
you know the.
What do they say meets the road?

2328
01:49:57,190 --> 01:50:00,100
Do you remember those days?
Like right after nine slash 11.

2329
01:50:00,650 --> 01:50:01,520
Oh yeah.

2330
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:04,530
Those are crazy days.
There's a weird feeling in the air,

2331
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:05,380
wasn't it?
It was like.

2332
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:08,530
It was also a weird comradery between 
Americans.

2333
01:50:08,531 --> 01:50:13,531
Like everywhere you go,
everybody had American flags on their 

2334
01:50:13,531 --> 01:50:13,531
cars.
It was nuts,

2335
01:50:13,531 --> 01:50:17,470
but it was for the right stuff.
At first it was like they were taking 

2336
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:19,370
know they were bringing water and they 
were bringing supplies and it was like,

2337
01:50:19,371 --> 01:50:21,470
we're gonna fucking,
we're going.

2338
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:26,500
It was like really amazing because it's 
like we're going to win out of goodness 

2339
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:29,240
and,
and that's how it felt then.

2340
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:31,220
And it was like,
you know,

2341
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:36,230
that people were like,
they were so good and they were so 

2342
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:39,710
caring and they were coming together 
against a common foe.

2343
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:40,790
Yeah.

2344
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:41,800
And the,
the,

2345
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:46,810
the love of the first responders to.
That was a big thing when I was in New 

2346
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:50,480
York in 2002 and I couldn't believe how 
nice people were being the cops and 

2347
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:53,130
firemen like yelling out to him,
waving to him,

2348
01:50:53,131 --> 01:50:55,680
honking their horns,
saying we love you.

2349
01:50:55,730 --> 01:50:57,000
Just,
it was crazy.

2350
01:50:57,001 --> 01:51:00,450
It was like you could feel the tangible 
result of them realizing like,

2351
01:51:00,451 --> 01:51:02,860
wow,
like we're in a situation where we were,

2352
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:07,940
we got attacked like,
and these are the people that saved 

2353
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:10,551
people and you know,
there's this weird feeling of mortality 

2354
01:51:10,551 --> 01:51:10,551
now and a real risk

2355
01:51:10,551 --> 01:51:12,190
New York when I was driving down the 
street,

2356
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,410
because I'm always watching people,
you know.

2357
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:19,860
And uh,
it was watching people walking down the 

2358
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:19,860
street after that for quite some time,
maybe six months,

2359
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:24,780
a few times I checked it.
They were actually making eye contact 

2360
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:28,000
with other people and smiling.
And then like a few years later,

2361
01:51:28,001 --> 01:51:29,440
you know,
after the Bush,

2362
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:34,470
the whole thing there,
they were back to just the looking 

2363
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:34,840
straight down thing and avoiding eye 
contact.

2364
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:36,040
But it was like,
wow,

2365
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:41,041
that was a mind meld going on.
It was like a positive love mindmeld 

2366
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:42,160
thing.

2367
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,580
Yeah.
It only lasted for a little while.

2368
01:51:43,581 --> 01:51:44,900
Right.
How long did it last?

2369
01:51:44,901 --> 01:51:45,620
Last few years

2370
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:48,430
lasted until Bush got up there and,
you know,

2371
01:51:48,431 --> 01:51:50,130
what did that act,
you know,

2372
01:51:50,131 --> 01:51:52,140
that sketch?
Yeah.

2373
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,730
One where he went on the boat.

2374
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:55,710
Mission accomplished.
Yeah.

2375
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:58,370
I think people also realize that this 
was a,

2376
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:02,460
that the powers that be had capitalized 
on all this,

2377
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:04,030
you know,
this,

2378
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:07,230
this sort of patriotism and all this,
uh,

2379
01:52:07,231 --> 01:52:10,840
there's this enthusiasm and America had 
for revenge and

2380
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:13,100
yeah,
first thing they cut the benefits of the

2381
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,800
street.
It's like,

2382
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:18,410
wow,
that's why I thought,

2383
01:52:18,411 --> 01:52:20,300
well,
last did Wall Street and do it,

2384
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:21,170
do you think?

2385
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:26,570
But nine slash 11,
I think that nine slash 11 more likely 

2386
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:28,770
than not was the result of a bunch of 
terrorists that attacked America.

2387
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:34,010
And why did they do it?
Most likely because of what America has 

2388
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:34,010
been doing overseas,
you know,

2389
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:35,640
we create enemies.
We do it from the beginning.

2390
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:37,350
We've done it from the beginning of 
time.

2391
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:42,410
Every nation that's been in power has 
always tried to steal the natural 

2392
01:52:42,410 --> 01:52:42,820
resources of other nations.
As A.

2393
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:45,770
I've always tried to influence the 
governments of other nations and there's

2394
01:52:45,771 --> 01:52:47,510
a blowback from that shit.
You know,

2395
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:52,520
the people think that they know that was
the most embarrassing and I'm in 

2396
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:55,850
enraging thing about what the Bush 
administration,

2397
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,920
the way they would flavor it,
they hate us for our freedom.

2398
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:01,330
But he actually said that on TV once.
They hate us for our freedom.

2399
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:03,630
But who is he talking to?
You talking about the terrorists?

2400
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:09,020
No,
he's talking to the people he 

2401
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:09,020
represents,
which are they investor classes?

2402
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:12,780
He said it himself and they and people 
do hate their freedom because it's their

2403
01:53:12,781 --> 01:53:14,130
freedom to be predators.

2404
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:16,240
I think he was talking,
I was talking to.

2405
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:19,410
I think he was talking to the duck 
dynasty fans are fucking stupid and they

2406
01:53:19,411 --> 01:53:24,411
were Rah Rah,
and they didn't want to put any thought 

2407
01:53:24,411 --> 01:53:24,411
to it though he hate us for our freedom 
and they're like,

2408
01:53:24,411 --> 01:53:27,470
let's go get some.
That's what he was doing.

2409
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:32,471
I think he was just patronizing 
knuckleheads and that this idea that 

2410
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:37,811
somehow or another people wouldn't like 
that people are having a good time 

2411
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:37,811
somewhere.
So they're willing to kill themselves by

2412
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:39,750
flying fucking planes into buildings.
This,

2413
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:40,610
it's insulting.

2414
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,940
Well,
I mean that's one way of looking at it.

2415
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:46,730
You know,
I've heard a lot of opinion,

2416
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,590
another band,
Jesus,

2417
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:51,560
you know,
now what has happened all over the world

2418
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:54,420
is now happening in our country.
You know,

2419
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,420
you know,
there was a lot of that.

2420
01:53:56,421 --> 01:53:57,860
Or people were like,
well,

2421
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,630
you know,
this,

2422
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:03,170
this can't happen here or anywhere else.
So,

2423
01:54:03,171 --> 01:54:08,171
you know,
they got to go win over there so they 

2424
01:54:08,171 --> 01:54:08,171
don't come here

2425
01:54:08,171 --> 01:54:11,180
thing.
But it's a weird feeling that people 

2426
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:13,611
have years later after the fact that not
only have we not capitalized on the 

2427
01:54:13,611 --> 01:54:15,890
situation and used it as a,
uh,

2428
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:18,900
as,
as the potential to sort of rectify some

2429
01:54:18,901 --> 01:54:23,901
of the problems that we have.
But instead we ruined the way the rest 

2430
01:54:23,901 --> 01:54:25,740
of the world looks at America.
We destroyed all the goodwill,

2431
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:30,860
all the praise and happiness that people
had for America responding to this 

2432
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:34,311
horrible tragedy,
all the love that people had sent to 

2433
01:54:34,311 --> 01:54:34,620
America from all across the world within
five,

2434
01:54:34,630 --> 01:54:36,720
six years,
America to become the Great Satan again.

2435
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:42,040
Half the fucking world.
They squandered a squad they don't 

2436
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:42,040
under.
They capitalized on it.

2437
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:43,880
That's the big thing to capitalize on 
it.

2438
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:46,150
They get their money off the top,
you know,

2439
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,170
and then they let you know,
they sell the weapons,

2440
01:54:49,171 --> 01:54:52,140
they get their money.
They're not around when the war start,

2441
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:55,500
when we go back and have to get smart 
and hip to that shit and just go,

2442
01:54:55,501 --> 01:55:00,501
you know,
we're not gonna you know what we're 

2443
01:55:00,501 --> 01:55:01,911
gonna do,
we're gonna do what we did after nine 

2444
01:55:01,911 --> 01:55:04,161
slash 11.
We're going to like do the right thing 

2445
01:55:04,161 --> 01:55:07,110
and the good thing for each other.
We're not going to do what you fucking,

2446
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:12,980
you know,
we're not going to be tools in your 

2447
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:15,711
useless,
obsolete wars where you make the stock 

2448
01:55:15,711 --> 01:55:19,140
markets go up because poverty increased 
amongst workers in the world.

2449
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:23,790
That's not gonna happen anymore.
I think that's slowly happening.

2450
01:55:23,850 --> 01:55:24,660
Yeah,
I do too.

2451
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:27,140
So you agree everything's going to be.
I do agree,

2452
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:30,570
but I also agree and my daughter says,
oh mother,

2453
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:35,900
just because you are getting old enough 
to die doesn't mean that any tire world 

2454
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:39,291
as a die with you.
That's what baby boomers think because 

2455
01:55:39,291 --> 01:55:40,680
you guys are so fucking narcissistic.
Not only have we run the world and blah,

2456
01:55:40,681 --> 01:55:42,450
blah blah,
but you know,

2457
01:55:42,451 --> 01:55:44,130
maybe it.
Maybe it's because I'm

2458
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,740
getting old,
but a boy.

2459
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:50,830
I'd like to see a big fucking dent and 
the bullshit and machine this bullshit 

2460
01:55:50,830 --> 01:55:52,290
system.
I think we've already had a big dent.

2461
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:55,110
We just haven't realized it yet.
You know what I was going to say is that

2462
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:59,850
in when we look back in history and we 
look at the Iraq war and thing,

2463
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:02,790
they find out that a guy who's a ceo of 
Halliburton,

2464
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:05,730
somehow or another got to be the vice 
president of the United States.

2465
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:10,350
We went into a war under dubious 
pretenses that there are some weapons of

2466
01:56:10,351 --> 01:56:15,351
mass destruction in some assholes,
shitty fucking country in the middle of 

2467
01:56:15,351 --> 01:56:19,311
nowhere a million people die when they 
look at the profits that were 

2468
01:56:19,311 --> 01:56:22,671
distributed to Halliburton and all these
different companies that profited from 

2469
01:56:22,671 --> 01:56:24,450
the rebuilding,
it's going to be so fucking transparent.

2470
01:56:24,451 --> 01:56:27,180
When they stop and they step back and 
they look at it,

2471
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:30,360
and then I think the other thing is 
going to be this Edward Snowden thing.

2472
01:56:30,690 --> 01:56:35,690
People just made it possible for the 
survivors of the nine slash 11 victims 

2473
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:39,900
to sue Saudi Arabia that that just 
passed last week.

2474
01:56:39,901 --> 01:56:44,430
Did you know that there's a big 
admission for people to look at.

2475
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:46,080
People need to read about that.
Well,

2476
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:48,090
the Saudis,
the hostages were.

2477
01:56:48,370 --> 01:56:50,430
Excuse me,
the hijackers were Saudis.

2478
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,420
Most of them,
right,

2479
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:53,490
but there are.
They're the ones who did it,

2480
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:54,970
I mean,
they're dead if they,

2481
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,350
if,
if that's the story.

2482
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:59,550
People say that it was just a regular 
move,

2483
01:56:59,551 --> 01:57:00,800
a vampire,
you know,

2484
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:02,310
you know,
the whole,

2485
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:07,880
uh,
the whole banking empire that runs 

2486
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:07,950
through the whole thing that they set it
up,

2487
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:13,370
they did it theater.
Doesn't that seem like that would be a 

2488
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:14,310
really fucking difficult thing to 
arrange and that would be really hard to

2489
01:57:14,311 --> 01:57:19,311
pull off,
pull off getting people to commit 

2490
01:57:19,311 --> 01:57:22,290
suicide by flying planes into buildings.
Oh,

2491
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:24,480
you mean getting operatives,
getting people to do that,

2492
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:29,560
getting people to commit suicide by 
taking a little plane and flying them 

2493
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:29,560
right into a building.

2494
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:29,640
It's easy.
If you had like,

2495
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:30,260
you know,
again,

2496
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:34,080
enough whores and drugs and money and 
then they sat their family up,

2497
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:39,770
people will do it.
I think it's incredibly difficult to 

2498
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:43,340
arrange that plan that I'm saying that 
Saudi Arabia had anything to do with it.

2499
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,430
What do,
you certainly did?

2500
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:52,640
I think that the idea that the bankers 
organized it and set it up in order to 

2501
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:55,520
rob people more that the government set 
up in order to use it as a pretest,

2502
01:57:55,550 --> 01:58:00,550
Iveta invade Iraq.
I think it's much more likely that the 

2503
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:03,711
capitalized on a situation and look for 
an opening that they had been looking 

2504
01:58:03,711 --> 01:58:05,620
for in the first place.
They were practicing it for a while.

2505
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:07,290
Always have been,
always have been,

2506
01:58:07,291 --> 01:58:08,220
always will be.
You know,

2507
01:58:08,221 --> 01:58:09,030
they're always.
They're always,

2508
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:12,510
they're all connected.
We're all connected.

2509
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:16,830
All the people who do that kind of stuff
all around the world,

2510
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:22,290
you know their arms merchants and you 
know their operatives well,

2511
01:58:22,291 --> 01:58:27,291
there's certainly people that are 
connected like that all around the 

2512
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:29,331
world.
There's certainly people that profit 

2513
01:58:29,331 --> 01:58:29,730
from from war all around the world.
I think much more likely though this was

2514
01:58:29,731 --> 01:58:33,420
the consequence of our actions overseas.
People say that,

2515
01:58:33,421 --> 01:58:34,530
but I'm not sure.
I didn't.

2516
01:58:34,531 --> 01:58:39,531
People say it was Silverstein getting 
insurance payout out more sense to me.

2517
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:42,030
Tower

2518
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:42,840
seven as well.
Right.

2519
01:58:42,841 --> 01:58:44,160
That was the thing that he said.
Pull it.

2520
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:45,770
Yeah.
He told them to pull it.

2521
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:47,560
It's like the.
It's the whole thing,

2522
01:58:48,150 --> 01:58:49,280
you know,
it's um,

2523
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:54,680
you know,
you have to burn your building down to 

2524
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:54,680
get the insurance money

2525
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:56,080
[inaudible] it wasn't getting rented.
Yeah,

2526
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:56,890
no,
that's true.

2527
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:57,510
I mean,
look,

2528
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:02,520
that's,
that is something we've seen on smaller 

2529
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:02,520
levels.
You know,

2530
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:05,530
we've seeded on lower levels.
The homeowners like their house on fire.

2531
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:09,550
There was a guy recently who was 
indicted for murder because he opened up

2532
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:14,080
his gas line and then set a timer and 
for a spark to go off.

2533
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:19,260
Uh,
but he had no idea how much of an 

2534
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:22,051
explosion of create and he blew up the 
neighbor's house to and killed a couple 

2535
01:59:22,051 --> 01:59:22,051
people.
I mean,

2536
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:24,090
it's just some crazy asshole that 
wanted.

2537
01:59:24,091 --> 01:59:25,060
He wanted some money.
Yeah.

2538
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:27,610
Here's how they fix the world.

2539
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:30,020
I don't know.

2540
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:35,850
No,
they have to get rid of insurance 

2541
01:59:35,850 --> 01:59:36,210
because it's the biggest.
It's just a fucking scam.

2542
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:38,040
Especially life insurance.
Gambling.

2543
01:59:38,041 --> 01:59:43,041
You're gonna fucking die.
You don't need to have an insurance 

2544
01:59:43,041 --> 01:59:43,920
policy saying you're not,
you know,

2545
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:46,380
because you are so already.
It's a fucking scam.

2546
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,890
And everything in this country is run by
insurance.

2547
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:55,070
Ha Hack insurance salesman.
Basically a bunch of guys that used to 

2548
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:56,070
be in prison and then,
you know,

2549
01:59:56,071 --> 02:00:00,360
they couldn't get a real fucking job,
so they started in insurance sales.

2550
02:00:00,650 --> 02:00:05,650
So a guy like Larry Silverstein who 
would have in the conspiracy model to 

2551
02:00:06,621 --> 02:00:11,621
have those buildings destroyed,
he would have no incentive to do that 

2552
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:11,621
because he couldn't be able to get,
get money from it.

2553
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:12,620
So it stopped things like that from 
happening.

2554
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:15,010
Well,
I'm not saying that.

2555
02:00:15,011 --> 02:00:19,720
I'm saying people are saying that.
I'm saying these are things I've heard.

2556
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:20,890
Of course.
Well,

2557
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:23,950
if you go on those fucking customer,
they're all,

2558
02:00:23,951 --> 02:00:26,020
they all make as much sense to the other
thing.

2559
02:00:26,430 --> 02:00:31,430
No,
I don't think that they make as much 

2560
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:31,430
sense.
I think that,

2561
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:32,120
uh,
there's a lot of chaos in,

2562
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:33,750
in,
in horrible tragedies.

2563
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:36,000
And a lot of people look for order in 
that chaos.

2564
02:00:36,001 --> 02:00:37,890
And one of the things they look for is 
conspiracy.

2565
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:38,850
I think it's a natural.

2566
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:43,920
I don't think it's any conspiracy that a
bunch of rich guys get together who own 

2567
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,200
everything on earth,
get together and hang out.

2568
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:49,230
That's not any conspiracy.
And they do.

2569
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:52,620
They all fucking know each other.
They have carlyle group,

2570
02:00:52,621 --> 02:00:54,720
so the whole thing,
they know what they're doing,

2571
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:55,930
you know,
and uh,

2572
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:58,410
and uh,
they make money from the shit they,

2573
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,260
they set up like going to the roulette 
wheel.

2574
02:01:01,590 --> 02:01:03,780
I'm gonna bet.
Read on 22.

2575
02:01:04,230 --> 02:01:05,430
Well,
here's another thing that,

2576
02:01:05,431 --> 02:01:10,431
uh,
someone said I repeated a wish I could 

2577
02:01:10,431 --> 02:01:11,680
credit the original person,
but a might actually been awesome.

2578
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:13,180
Were stoned as fuck,
I don't even remember.

2579
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:18,010
But the original quote was that 
September 11th when,

2580
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,690
when people talk about conspiracy 
theories,

2581
02:01:19,691 --> 02:01:22,030
that's one of the big ones.
And people always go,

2582
02:01:22,031 --> 02:01:23,860
do you believe?
What do you think about September 11th?

2583
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:29,340
I always ask people,
do you believe the September 11th 

2584
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:29,340
happened?
And they were like,

2585
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,530
what do you mean?
Do you believe that planes were,

2586
02:01:31,570 --> 02:01:36,570
were hijacked?
And they flew them into buildings and 

2587
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:36,570
they killed a bunch of people.
Do you believe that that happened?

2588
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:36,850
It,
most people say yes.

2589
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:42,270
And I say,
well then you believe in conspiracies 

2590
02:01:42,270 --> 02:01:42,270
because

2591
02:01:42,270 --> 02:01:43,520
they conspired to do that.
They'd have to be a conspiracy.

2592
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:48,260
The only way you get planes to fly into 
buildings show it's fake where they show

2593
02:01:48,261 --> 02:01:52,040
it to all fake.
That's probably CIA shit right there.

2594
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:57,190
That's probably to diffuse the 
architects and engineers for nine slash 

2595
02:01:57,190 --> 02:02:01,001
11 truth and pink along those lines that
are asking for for answers because even 

2596
02:02:01,281 --> 02:02:06,281
if they're wrong,
they're still stirring the pot so much 

2597
02:02:06,281 --> 02:02:07,760
that it makes it hot for anybody who's 
in public office.

2598
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:11,360
It makes it difficult.
So this is a natural inclination.

2599
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:15,140
That's the other conspiracy that 
everybody talks about.

2600
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:20,170
That's a fascinating one that people 
have been wanting more and more lately 

2601
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:21,560
to pin on Lee Harvey Oswald as being the
lone gunman.

2602
02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:25,400
And I think that's hilarious because 
people are moving away from that.

2603
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:26,340
No,
no,

2604
02:02:26,341 --> 02:02:26,660
no,
no.

2605
02:02:26,661 --> 02:02:29,600
There's a lot of people.
What was that guy that wrote that book?

2606
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,150
Cape Vincent Bugliosi,
however you say his last name,

2607
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:35,150
he wrote a book called case closed,
which is fucking retarded.

2608
02:02:35,151 --> 02:02:40,151
It's not closed at all.
Like the idea that there's a lot of 

2609
02:02:40,151 --> 02:02:40,151
people that,
uh,

2610
02:02:40,151 --> 02:02:41,150
that were witness to,
that,

2611
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:45,320
that wound up murdered a wound up dying 
in very strange ways.

2612
02:02:45,321 --> 02:02:50,321
More than a hundred over 10 years and 
they said that the odds of those people 

2613
02:02:50,321 --> 02:02:51,980
all dying like that,
but some fucking astronomical number.

2614
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:54,560
It's fascinating to follow it.
It is.

2615
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:59,650
All these years.
I remember I was in about the fifth 

2616
02:02:59,650 --> 02:03:02,111
grade when they came in and they said 
that we're were Latin school out early 

2617
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:05,220
on account of our president has just 
been set.

2618
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:08,830
His Dad being shot.
That was freaky.

2619
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:10,930
That's one of those you never forget 
where you were moments,

2620
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:15,940
right?
I was so mad because that night I was 

2621
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:18,641
having my first slumber party and we're 
going to have the scary movies and 

2622
02:03:20,451 --> 02:03:24,930
there's only like three channels and it 
was all about the president in that.

2623
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:29,950
So they preempted all the scary movies.
So cancel my party was.

2624
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:34,400
That sucks because back then do you have
a VCR?

2625
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:36,880
Didn't have anything.
You have to deal with it,

2626
02:03:36,881 --> 02:03:41,881
but it was the movie I wanted to see it.
Was that one about the clay to burrata?

2627
02:03:43,461 --> 02:03:45,290
Nick tell.
Oh yeah,

2628
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:46,460
yeah,
you'll hit the fuck.

2629
02:03:46,461 --> 02:03:47,270
Was that,
uh,

2630
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:51,740
the guy with the spaceship and from came
from outer space?

2631
02:03:51,741 --> 02:03:54,980
Is that what it was,
that it wasn't more of worlds?

2632
02:03:54,981 --> 02:03:57,160
Was it more of worlds?
It was war of worlds.

2633
02:03:57,170 --> 02:04:02,170
I think somebody that claimed to know.
I wanted to say that when I was running 

2634
02:04:02,691 --> 02:04:07,691
for president so bad on a stage,
how many war of worlds have there been?

2635
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:12,560
Those are the 2005.
One which was full.

2636
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:17,690
People were screaming in the streets and
they thought we really had been invaded.

2637
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:19,940
They say they're going to do another one
like that,

2638
02:04:19,941 --> 02:04:24,941
a fake alien invasion movie and I'm.
I'm projected onto the stuff that is in 

2639
02:04:26,331 --> 02:04:31,331
the chem trails and that people are 
going to see a fault and artificial 

2640
02:04:31,331 --> 02:04:35,531
reality right before their eyes.
Jamie's got it the day the earth stood 

2641
02:04:35,531 --> 02:04:35,531
still.
That was it.

2642
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:38,250
That was awesome.
I watched that the other day actually.

2643
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:39,900
I just said though,
yes I did.

2644
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:41,120
I see people like

2645
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:45,420
are programmed in America that they 
can't hear that they can't hear it.

2646
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:47,420
Do you think that they would actually do
that?

2647
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:52,040
Like if there was something like a war 
of worlds type thing?

2648
02:04:52,041 --> 02:04:57,041
Again,
remember winning the Orson Welles did 

2649
02:04:57,041 --> 02:04:57,041
that on the radio and freak the pop 
population out.

2650
02:04:57,041 --> 02:04:58,100
You could get sued if he did something 
like that today,

2651
02:04:58,101 --> 02:05:03,101
wouldn't you?
If you had like a fake news story and 

2652
02:05:03,101 --> 02:05:03,101
people are committing suicide because 
they thought the aliens were attacking,

2653
02:05:03,101 --> 02:05:06,200
they say they're going to do it to get 
people that run to the fema camps.

2654
02:05:09,820 --> 02:05:12,710
I've got one place where there's water 
and food,

2655
02:05:12,711 --> 02:05:14,900
so they'll go,
I have one piece of advice.

2656
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:16,760
Whoever they are,
don't listen to them anymore.

2657
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:18,590
They're.
They're telling you some crazy shit.

2658
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:20,150
It's all day.
That's what they say.

2659
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:24,440
That's a base a say.
He gets to the FEMA camps.

2660
02:05:24,530 --> 02:05:25,340
Yeah.
Doesn't make any sense.

2661
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,230
I'll tell you what doesn't make any 
sense.

2662
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:30,380
You can't get a straight answer anywhere
on the Internet.

2663
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:35,540
It's all fucking bullshit on both sides.
The where's the real news,

2664
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:37,640
but here's the problem with the Fema 
camp thing.

2665
02:05:38,090 --> 02:05:40,250
Here's the number one problem.
You got to feed this fucking people.

2666
02:05:40,430 --> 02:05:42,440
You gotta take care of either going to 
kill them,

2667
02:05:42,650 --> 02:05:47,650
which costs money because you're gonna 
have to get rid of the bodies and shoot 

2668
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:47,650
them and all that shit,
and then they're not going to contribute

2669
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:50,560
any money to tax dollars anymore.
That's what I said.

2670
02:05:51,290 --> 02:05:54,670
You don't lock up your own tax base and 
yet that's what they're doing.

2671
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:58,650
Started locking everybody up for pot.
Really locking up though.

2672
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:01,160
A lot of kids that work a little bit of 
that,

2673
02:06:01,161 --> 02:06:04,340
but there's also they're profiting off 
of putting people in prison.

2674
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:09,550
A lot of them young black men and 
they're putting people that are a part 

2675
02:06:09,550 --> 02:06:10,070
of this disenfranchised system.
Yeah,

2676
02:06:10,071 --> 02:06:13,070
and Latino and they're profiting off of 
them.

2677
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:15,350
They're just using them to make profit,
but they're not.

2678
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:18,260
They're not taking like the biggest,
baddest tax donators in the world.

2679
02:06:18,261 --> 02:06:23,261
They're not doing that.
They're going after people that are in 

2680
02:06:23,261 --> 02:06:23,261
poverty.
That's why,

2681
02:06:23,261 --> 02:06:24,620
because those people oftentimes are 
contributing to the system as far as tax

2682
02:06:24,621 --> 02:06:27,110
money anyway.
They might buy like sales tax and things

2683
02:06:27,111 --> 02:06:32,111
along those lines,
but they're probably not making enough 

2684
02:06:32,111 --> 02:06:32,111
money declared to pay a significant 
amount of income tax.

2685
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:35,780
There's nothing left to be robbed.
Yes.

2686
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:40,840
Well,
there are other also the got a fucking 

2687
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:40,840
terrible.
Roll the dice by life threatening.

2688
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:45,220
They start out in massive debt from the 
jump because they're born into some 

2689
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:49,901
terrible society.
They're born into a horrible 

2690
02:06:49,901 --> 02:06:49,901
neighborhood.
Terrible parents,

2691
02:06:49,901 --> 02:06:53,771
terrible crime filled streets around the
system that exploits the many for the 

2692
02:06:54,411 --> 02:06:56,390
benefit of the few.
It certainly is.

2693
02:06:56,430 --> 02:06:58,220
Yeah,
but that can easily be changed.

2694
02:06:58,610 --> 02:07:01,430
It can be changed by some people have 
some fucking brains in their head.

2695
02:07:01,790 --> 02:07:02,530
They'd go,
Geez,

2696
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:07,540
I don't want to have to live on top of a
mountain behind 18 sets of gates.

2697
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:12,490
Yeah.
Helicopter over the fucking a.

2698
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:14,400
what's it called?

2699
02:07:16,030 --> 02:07:19,270
Grand Canyon Grocery still.
What's it called?

2700
02:07:19,570 --> 02:07:20,420
Ralph's.
Yeah,

2701
02:07:20,421 --> 02:07:25,421
something like that.
It's like I got to have bodyguards in 

2702
02:07:25,421 --> 02:07:25,421
the helicopter over the roof of Ralph's.

2703
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:29,420
You can't.
You can't divorce.

2704
02:07:29,421 --> 02:07:33,290
You can't like take that may steps back 
from humanity.

2705
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:37,330
You can't.
They I'll go nuts to do you see the shit

2706
02:07:37,331 --> 02:07:39,640
they do because they're so fucking 
crazy.

2707
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:44,700
You.
One thing that's consistent in this 

2708
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,570
conversation is the word day and I think
in a bad way and in a good way,

2709
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:49,030
and I say get the good way is that it's 
always a va,

2710
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:54,040
which corporation.
It's a bunch of people acting together 

2711
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:56,521
doing terrible things and I think that 
where we're wrong as a culture is not 

2712
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:59,530
that we don't think of ourselves as 
individuals,

2713
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:03,580
but we don't think of giant groups as 
individuals,

2714
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:06,070
as being a bunch of different 
individuals together.

2715
02:08:06,071 --> 02:08:08,740
You become a part of this corporation 
then you become a va.

2716
02:08:08,810 --> 02:08:11,530
I know I can get away with shady.
FIne.

2717
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:14,900
No,
you're right with that stupid fuckers.

2718
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:19,380
Maybe real definitive here.
Stupid backward,

2719
02:08:19,381 --> 02:08:23,670
lemming,
motherfucking idiots that are in control

2720
02:08:23,671 --> 02:08:24,360
of everything.

2721
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:30,200
Um,
but are they just a part of this fucked 

2722
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:30,200
up system that we're talkIng about?
Like if you,

2723
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:34,341
if you come along,
like say if you're going to work for 

2724
02:08:34,341 --> 02:08:36,651
some guy who's a fucking crazy control 
freak and you're working in his office 

2725
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:41,810
and know they have specific rules to 
company rules that you have over the 

2726
02:08:41,810 --> 02:08:42,210
coffee machine and the way he wants you 
to dress,

2727
02:08:42,211 --> 02:08:47,211
the way he wants you to talk.
if you're trying to advance inside that 

2728
02:08:47,211 --> 02:08:47,211
system,
you behave the way that

2729
02:08:47,211 --> 02:08:51,350
system is,
that we got to get rid of all 

2730
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:51,350
corporations.
They're the enemy.

2731
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:52,280
Everything,
decent government and everything.

2732
02:08:52,290 --> 02:08:52,800
But,
um,

2733
02:08:52,801 --> 02:08:54,150
you know,
they're bullshit.

2734
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,730
They're also where we get laptops 
democratic.

2735
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:59,610
There's no democracy and a Fucking 
corporation.

2736
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:03,060
It's corporate feudalism.
That's what's forced it oN a,

2737
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,940
on all of us.
And you have to do what your boss says.

2738
02:09:05,941 --> 02:09:10,941
He might be on coke.
Of course he is on there all fucking 

2739
02:09:10,941 --> 02:09:12,870
uncle and he might be answering on 
godly.

2740
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:14,670
Well,
he'll be on adderall.

2741
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:17,280
Well,
some people are not meant for him,

2742
02:09:19,650 --> 02:09:24,650
but I mean,
and it's at his whim that you live and 

2743
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:24,650
die.
That ain't right.

2744
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:25,810
That's what corporations do.
And,

2745
02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:27,220
and these fucking,
uh,

2746
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:28,200
you know,
uh,

2747
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:32,190
servants that they put on the supreme 
court to make a corporation,

2748
02:09:32,191 --> 02:09:35,310
a human.
I think we should take advantage of that

2749
02:09:35,311 --> 02:09:38,640
and do just the opposite and get all the
american people together,

2750
02:09:38,641 --> 02:09:40,440
not to,
to never vote,

2751
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:43,950
never cast another fucking boat and 
incorporate.

2752
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:49,310
And then we'll build the fucking 
government for the money they fucking 

2753
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:49,860
stole from us in the first god damn 
place.

2754
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:51,570
We'll get our money back.

2755
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:54,480
strong words from roseanne barr,
ladies and gentlemen,

2756
02:09:54,540 --> 02:09:58,440
strong words or not or not.
You know,

2757
02:09:58,441 --> 02:10:01,110
one of the things that I thought was 
fascinating that you were talking about,

2758
02:10:01,111 --> 02:10:05,850
one of your reasons why you love Hawaii 
is because they still have a goddess.

2759
02:10:06,010 --> 02:10:08,190
You still have an active goddess.
I think it's a,

2760
02:10:08,191 --> 02:10:12,360
it's a fascinating thing in our culture 
that somewhere along the line of being a

2761
02:10:12,361 --> 02:10:15,750
woman or respecting the idea of a 
goddess,

2762
02:10:16,110 --> 02:10:18,320
you know,
is completely eliminated from,

2763
02:10:18,430 --> 02:10:22,350
from the whole structure of the culture.
It's kinda gone.

2764
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:25,580
There's women,
there's mothers as wives.

2765
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:30,560
Is that the strong feMinine power 
structure that you know,

2766
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:33,150
like,
or power position of the goddess doesn't

2767
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:36,590
exist in the feminine.
All these fucked up cultures.

2768
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:37,590
Well,
that's what they get.

2769
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:42,620
I gotta get rid of first because it 
makes too much sense to women when they 

2770
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:46,641
got to try to fuck with women's minds 
that that's what they spend 99 percent 

2771
02:10:46,641 --> 02:10:50,601
of their lives doing.
That the idiots because they got to get 

2772
02:10:50,601 --> 02:10:51,370
women to continue to,
um,

2773
02:10:51,460 --> 02:10:52,560
you know,
bear bear,

2774
02:10:52,770 --> 02:10:56,790
bear kids for them to send off to wars 
and molest.

2775
02:10:57,540 --> 02:10:58,940
Oh,
what ended thinking?

2776
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:01,440
the things that like the,
the,

2777
02:11:01,450 --> 02:11:05,090
the standard of feminine or the,
uh,

2778
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:05,510
the,
the,

2779
02:11:05,511 --> 02:11:10,511
the philosophy of feminine though 
they're just a natural instinct and 

2780
02:11:10,511 --> 02:11:12,260
inclination is to take care of things.
Nurturing things,

2781
02:11:12,261 --> 02:11:13,190
be loving to thing.

2782
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:16,860
That's a little bit.
That's not exactly.

2783
02:11:16,861 --> 02:11:19,770
Everyone says that the yang and the 
union of things,

2784
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:22,020
women,
it's the correct thing.

2785
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:27,310
You,
when you See your kids going to chew on 

2786
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:28,150
an electric cord,
like they'll do these fucking idiot.

2787
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:31,680
You say,
get the fat down.

2788
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:34,320
That's it to every.
All parents say that,

2789
02:11:34,410 --> 02:11:37,170
but that's out of love that you are 
doing that.

2790
02:11:37,171 --> 02:11:39,330
So that's what feminine is.

2791
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:42,100
And well,
you would also say that there's,

2792
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:47,130
there's a yin and a yang.
The masculine is more aggressive and 

2793
02:11:47,130 --> 02:11:47,820
more,
and if you look at like a society that's

2794
02:11:47,821 --> 02:11:50,350
spiraling out of control,
it'll go one way or the other.

2795
02:11:50,351 --> 02:11:52,630
It'll go too far one way or too far the 
other way.

2796
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,860
And the,
you know,

2797
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:58,900
the amazons or fucking kidnapping man 
and cutting their dicks off amazon 

2798
02:11:58,900 --> 02:11:59,290
women.
Where's that a book?

2799
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:02,320
I'm just making it.
That would be a society like shit,

2800
02:12:02,321 --> 02:12:03,910
man.
The women have taken control.

2801
02:12:03,970 --> 02:12:04,630
That would be awful.

2802
02:12:07,690 --> 02:12:09,580
Of course they do.
They don't want to cut it off.

2803
02:12:09,581 --> 02:12:14,581
I mean,
being a women like men who have 

2804
02:12:14,581 --> 02:12:14,581
erections,
that's the bottom of fucking line.

2805
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:18,040
Of course they do.
That's what you're seeking.

2806
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:23,400
However,
you know that there are so intelligent 

2807
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:28,351
systems and it seems that women are the 
ones who actually think of them because 

2808
02:12:29,531 --> 02:12:31,240
they have to like,
in what way?

2809
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:32,820
What intelligence systems?
Oh,

2810
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:33,580
well,
like,

2811
02:12:33,581 --> 02:12:34,230
you know,
uh,

2812
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:35,630
a lot of,
you know,

2813
02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:40,450
social change comes one.
Women start doing it also,

2814
02:12:40,451 --> 02:12:42,140
social change really?
Yeah,

2815
02:12:42,250 --> 02:12:47,250
and community social and start 
implementing a smarter system that 

2816
02:12:48,941 --> 02:12:51,910
changes things right away and there's 
all kinds of evidence out there that you

2817
02:12:51,911 --> 02:12:55,960
can read about like right now in africa,
a whole bunch of new systems,

2818
02:12:56,200 --> 02:13:01,200
you know,
and women are the ones who are like 

2819
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:01,690
thinking them up because like I said,
a lot of these women,

2820
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:07,150
myself included in the old days,
you had to fix a whole lot of shit with 

2821
02:13:07,150 --> 02:13:09,700
gestures and a rubber band and a 
paperclip.

2822
02:13:10,150 --> 02:13:15,150
You had to like organize the fucking 
shit load of people around you to do 

2823
02:13:15,150 --> 02:13:19,921
what needed to be done for the group.
it's like hive mind and we were trained 

2824
02:13:19,921 --> 02:13:21,160
for that.
So it's like,

2825
02:13:21,161 --> 02:13:26,161
you know,
if we're all going to survive in this 

2826
02:13:26,161 --> 02:13:26,161
family,
this is what I need you to do.

2827
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:30,850
If we need to make our common goal 
visible and all work towards it.

2828
02:13:30,851 --> 02:13:35,851
Not against it.
And that's what the mother brings to a 

2829
02:13:35,851 --> 02:13:39,801
family and the father too.
But the mother is the one who's there 

2830
02:13:39,801 --> 02:13:40,650
every day.
But in general,

2831
02:13:40,651 --> 02:13:45,651
I'm speaking in generalities,
but she's there and she implements that 

2832
02:13:45,651 --> 02:13:47,100
system of sharing.
And commonwealth,

2833
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:49,540
do you know dr chris ryan is.
Have you ever heard of.

2834
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:52,570
Haven't heard of the book sex at dawn 
[inaudible].

2835
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:58,010
He's a good friend and we've had them on
the podcast several times and he's a 

2836
02:13:58,010 --> 02:14:00,890
really,
really brilliant guy and one of the 

2837
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:00,930
things that he talked about was that in 
hunter gatherer cultures,

2838
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:04,500
the relationship between the man and the
woman was much,

2839
02:14:04,501 --> 02:14:09,501
much,
much more equal because the women did a 

2840
02:14:09,501 --> 02:14:11,631
huge amount of that work.
A hUge amount of the reason why 

2841
02:14:11,631 --> 02:14:12,930
everybody was surviving and taking care 
of their children and feeding themselves

2842
02:14:12,931 --> 02:14:15,930
was because of the gathering part.
It wasn't so much the hunting.

2843
02:14:15,931 --> 02:14:19,680
The men would be out doing the hunting.
They would be successful occasionally,

2844
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:22,560
but it wasn't all the time.
So they relied on crops.

2845
02:14:22,561 --> 02:14:24,450
they relied on the things that they grew
in,

2846
02:14:24,451 --> 02:14:26,970
the things that they picked.
And that because of that,

2847
02:14:26,971 --> 02:14:30,680
the women had a prominent position of 
power and in those cultures.

2848
02:14:30,681 --> 02:14:30,730
Yeah,

2849
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:31,790
because we,
we,

2850
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:37,120
we got our,
our thinking is a little more circular,

2851
02:14:37,610 --> 02:14:39,950
not always,
but in generalities,

2852
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:42,590
a little more connected,
a little more,

2853
02:14:42,830 --> 02:14:45,760
you know,
we're men seems to be um,

2854
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:49,580
a equals b,
it seems this way.

2855
02:14:49,581 --> 02:14:54,581
What do you call that?
Hierarchal or something and they're 

2856
02:14:54,581 --> 02:14:54,581
trained to do that.
I,

2857
02:14:54,581 --> 02:14:57,050
I don't doubt that it could be switched 
at any point if you're training people,

2858
02:14:57,051 --> 02:15:00,080
but after you've been doing something 
for a couple thousand years,

2859
02:15:00,110 --> 02:15:04,690
it kinda comes into your dna and nine it
gets like it's your default because you,

2860
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:07,460
you've been while bread or program for 
that,

2861
02:15:07,461 --> 02:15:10,790
you know,
but I don't think that is who we are.

2862
02:15:10,791 --> 02:15:13,790
I think were much smarter than what 
we're allowed to be.

2863
02:15:13,791 --> 02:15:15,290
And I think that,
you know,

2864
02:15:15,370 --> 02:15:20,370
if we had ultimate freedom and small 
groups of communities of self rule where

2865
02:15:22,381 --> 02:15:27,381
it was the goal of each community to be 
sustainable and justice and trade with 

2866
02:15:27,891 --> 02:15:32,891
your neighbor,
I think we'd be a lot better because 

2867
02:15:32,891 --> 02:15:33,470
that is who we are before we all got 
fucked up with this shit.

2868
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:38,770
I think you're right.
and I think that one of the things that 

2869
02:15:38,770 --> 02:15:38,770
these things represent what you started 
talking about,

2870
02:15:38,770 --> 02:15:42,971
like an ancient culture that you know,
favored women more or culture over here 

2871
02:15:42,971 --> 02:15:47,321
that favors men more or get weirdness 
like papau new Guinea where they 

2872
02:15:47,321 --> 02:15:49,550
sexually molest young boys from the time
they're young.

2873
02:15:49,551 --> 02:15:51,340
They take them away from their parents 
and they,

2874
02:15:51,510 --> 02:15:53,330
they make them ingest men,
semen,

2875
02:15:53,331 --> 02:15:55,310
they call them semen warriors.
It's crazy.

2876
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:57,410
But what is that?
Well that represents this,

2877
02:15:57,680 --> 02:16:01,120
this crazy range that we have of,
of behavior patterns.

2878
02:16:01,121 --> 02:16:06,121
So people tend to follow.
And I think that discussion and 

2879
02:16:06,121 --> 02:16:08,510
communication and things like these,
these conversations are what lead people

2880
02:16:08,511 --> 02:16:13,511
to start analyzing the behavior 
structure and the conversation makes 

2881
02:16:13,511 --> 02:16:17,500
people look at the way things are and 
compare them to whether it's passive 

2882
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:19,880
realizations or civilizations like 
Iceland or whatever it is.

2883
02:16:20,150 --> 02:16:25,150
And they start thinking about 
reorganizing and reengineering the 

2884
02:16:25,150 --> 02:16:27,440
system because the system is just that.
It's something that people create and it

2885
02:16:27,441 --> 02:16:30,040
might be good and,
but people

2886
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,380
have accepted because they've been 
brainwashed into it.

2887
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:36,370
They've been brainwashed into thinking 
that it's our master,

2888
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:38,650
but it's our tool.
And you know,

2889
02:16:38,651 --> 02:16:43,651
it take it,
it is a government that makes that 

2890
02:16:43,651 --> 02:16:45,100
happen.
Just efficient,

2891
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:47,050
you know,
efficient government.

2892
02:16:47,860 --> 02:16:50,320
It's like we've never,
we've never really had that here.

2893
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:55,480
You're right.
And it's so corrupt now at this point 

2894
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:56,460
that I agree with what you said earlier 
before that thing.

2895
02:16:57,070 --> 02:16:58,180
Well,
I think it is.

2896
02:16:58,240 --> 02:16:59,440
And uh,
I have,

2897
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:02,050
you know,
I have hope in my fellow humans,

2898
02:17:02,051 --> 02:17:05,950
not in,
not in any fairy tale way,

2899
02:17:05,951 --> 02:17:07,290
but um,
you know,

2900
02:17:07,580 --> 02:17:10,150
there's a movement now and starting in,
uh,

2901
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:15,300
in,
in Italy and it's going to go 

2902
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:15,300
everywhere.
It's called the five star movement.

2903
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:16,110
And it has a,
you know,

2904
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:21,120
new systems of law,
the international tribunal of common law

2905
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:24,220
of a,
and I'm saying it wrong,

2906
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:28,390
but it's like common commonwealth common
law and uh,

2907
02:17:28,391 --> 02:17:32,560
you know,
it's like taking the idea of sovereignty

2908
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:34,090
on,
on behalf of,

2909
02:17:34,091 --> 02:17:36,610
you know,
the regular people of this planet,

2910
02:17:37,130 --> 02:17:40,570
all the citizens of this planet.
And um,

2911
02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:45,630
you know,
judging the people who have caused an 

2912
02:17:45,630 --> 02:17:47,170
imposed misery for no reason by profit.
And you know,

2913
02:17:47,171 --> 02:17:50,080
the people,
they do have that power and it is coming

2914
02:17:50,081 --> 02:17:55,081
in.
It is because of the internet and it is 

2915
02:17:55,081 --> 02:17:55,081
because the shows like this,
because we can talk this way,

2916
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:58,750
you know,
I have faith in my menu or generation,

2917
02:17:58,751 --> 02:18:01,030
younger people might.
My kids are your age,

2918
02:18:01,031 --> 02:18:03,220
little bit younger,
probably just your age,

2919
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:03,980
but uh,
you know,

2920
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,970
y'all are getting smarter and you,
you will,

2921
02:18:07,390 --> 02:18:10,090
um,
you know,

2922
02:18:10,091 --> 02:18:12,910
you're going to solve a lot of stuff 
because you're smart and you have the,

2923
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:17,350
you have the technology and the tools at
your disposal to do so.

2924
02:18:17,410 --> 02:18:19,550
I think it's really the people far 
younger than me that are,

2925
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:22,270
I think it's the people that are 
listening to people like us having these

2926
02:18:22,271 --> 02:18:25,300
conversations and these are the first 
first exposures.

2927
02:18:25,301 --> 02:18:28,360
They've had these ideas and he'll shape 
them and change them while they're still

2928
02:18:28,361 --> 02:18:33,361
young.
I think the rigid people that get into 

2929
02:18:33,361 --> 02:18:33,790
their thirties with mortgages and 
forties and what have you,

2930
02:18:34,090 --> 02:18:36,010
those are the really hard ones to 
fucking change.

2931
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:38,700
But you get a hold of some 18 year old 
kid is just out of high school and knows

2932
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:40,520
whose parents are retarded.
And you know,

2933
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:43,780
he goes to college and he listens to a 
podcast where rosanne breaks down what's

2934
02:18:43,781 --> 02:18:48,781
wrong that that plants a seed in his 
head or her head and then from there 

2935
02:18:48,781 --> 02:18:53,130
they go on and they improve the,
the structure from where they can access

2936
02:18:53,441 --> 02:18:57,090
it as at the beginning,
at any point it can be,

2937
02:18:57,091 --> 02:18:57,410
you know,

2938
02:18:57,480 --> 02:18:58,800
even one small change

2939
02:18:59,210 --> 02:19:04,210
right out of college not being saddled 
down with mortgages and kids and all 

2940
02:19:04,671 --> 02:19:06,050
this different stuff that makes it 
really,

2941
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:11,230
really hard to change.
But be free from the jump and then 

2942
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:13,570
engineer your life and in turn affect a 
lot.

2943
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:14,760
I think

2944
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:16,800
it's really scary.
Awesome.

2945
02:19:16,801 --> 02:19:18,330
Cool.
Is that,

2946
02:19:18,331 --> 02:19:21,800
it's far younger than even them because 
like I have a lot of.

2947
02:19:21,810 --> 02:19:26,810
I don't know if you looked into it,
there's a lot of hope for autistic 

2948
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:28,190
people think

2949
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:32,780
because they are very solution driven 
and I'm on that spectrum,

2950
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:33,860
you know,
but,

2951
02:19:33,890 --> 02:19:37,340
but they're able to conceive of the idea
of actual solutions,

2952
02:19:37,341 --> 02:19:41,150
actual problems instead of how am I 
going to make money off this problem,

2953
02:19:41,151 --> 02:19:44,570
which is like my generation and and 
disappearing.

2954
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:49,400
But kids as young as nine years old are 
implementing incredible systems on the,

2955
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:52,100
on the internet that actually like,
you know,

2956
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:53,730
uh,
um,

2957
02:19:55,520 --> 02:20:00,520
what do you call it for battering,
battering and fuel batteries and fuel 

2958
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:03,880
and all kinds of new things.
Sure.

2959
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:06,890
These guys,
these people are unbelievable.

2960
02:20:06,891 --> 02:20:10,760
These young,
really young and especially the ones who

2961
02:20:10,761 --> 02:20:15,761
have intense focus.
Their focus is so intense that they can 

2962
02:20:15,761 --> 02:20:16,820
only do one thing.
But when applied,

2963
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:22,120
I mean they're,
these are like some of the greatest 

2964
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:22,370
thinkers as per solutions that have ever
existed.

2965
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:25,760
And now this is like the time of magic 
as I really like.

2966
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,710
Because one time I want to tell you the 
story,

2967
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:29,480
but you finished and then.
Oh no,

2968
02:20:29,490 --> 02:20:30,110
no,
please do.

2969
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,870
Oh,
this was like a thing that really fucked

2970
02:20:31,871 --> 02:20:35,480
up my mind.
I was at this party in,

2971
02:20:35,481 --> 02:20:38,090
there was all these people,
you know,

2972
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:43,330
from all over the place.
And there was this guy there and he had 

2973
02:20:43,330 --> 02:20:44,750
done all the satellite work for ted 
turner at the time,

2974
02:20:44,751 --> 02:20:49,751
you know,
when they started cable news and 

2975
02:20:49,751 --> 02:20:49,751
everything.
And he,

2976
02:20:49,751 --> 02:20:53,440
he was telling me what his opinion of 
the impact of technology and,

2977
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:56,690
and freedom of information for people to
be able to.

2978
02:20:56,950 --> 02:20:58,370
And,
and here's what he said,

2979
02:20:58,371 --> 02:21:01,100
because I think of it everyday.
So for the first time in history,

2980
02:21:01,101 --> 02:21:06,101
human history information reaches the 
people without any state,

2981
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:10,790
without any church stopping it.
He said this,

2982
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:16,030
this is going to give birth to something
that the people in the who look at the 

2983
02:21:16,030 --> 02:21:18,920
renaissance as like a great time,
that's not,

2984
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:20,840
it's going to be a million times.

2985
02:21:20,890 --> 02:21:23,660
But he said this is going to be the time
of great freedom.

2986
02:21:23,661 --> 02:21:25,670
And he said in the greatest thing about 
it is that,

2987
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:30,940
you know,
the ills of the world will begin to 

2988
02:21:30,940 --> 02:21:33,581
disappear because people will be smart 
enough when we won't want to walk over 

2989
02:21:33,581 --> 02:21:35,870
dead bodies anymore because they'll 
realize that what they do,

2990
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:39,890
it is who they are and anyone into this 
whole thing.

2991
02:21:39,891 --> 02:21:42,090
And I think I think of it every day.
And uh,

2992
02:21:42,510 --> 02:21:46,460
and I,
I look for evidence that it's true and I

2993
02:21:46,461 --> 02:21:48,260
find it everywhere,
all over the internet.

2994
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:51,050
Smart people,
they know the right thing to do.

2995
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:56,140
They know that this at the time were 
they know us just deciding that we're 

2996
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:58,310
going to do the right thing for the 
right reason at the right time.

2997
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:03,520
It's never been done and now it's 
possible in this the first time that 

2998
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:07,241
it's really been possible for people to 
like really get together and um,

2999
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:14,170
demand and bring change and a whole,
a whole new world,

3000
02:22:15,050 --> 02:22:20,050
a whole new world.
And we can do it all with everything 

3001
02:22:20,050 --> 02:22:23,111
that already exists.
We don't have to have any wars and we 

3002
02:22:23,111 --> 02:22:23,270
don't have to reinvent the wheel either.
It all exists.

3003
02:22:23,271 --> 02:22:26,550
What we need is the right intelligence,
intelligence

3004
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:28,800
and philosophy at the top,
driving it.

3005
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:30,390
And that exists to.

3006
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:33,350
You're so much more positive than you 
were two hours ago.

3007
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:37,530
Well,
here's why I'm positive because he is as

3008
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:42,560
positive vr.
You know about zen and stuff for as 

3009
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:42,560
much,
you got to stay in balance.

3010
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:46,920
The reason that you can be that positive
as you are aware of how negative it is,

3011
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:49,800
you need what?
You got to have both.

3012
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:54,090
You've got to have both because you have
to see how fucking stupid shit is.

3013
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:57,120
I often think that that's one of the 
things that motivates good things,

3014
02:22:57,230 --> 02:23:02,230
is it seeing eviL in the world and it's 
almost like it has to exist in order to 

3015
02:23:02,230 --> 02:23:05,250
motivate good because we're so.
We're so far from perfect.

3016
02:23:05,490 --> 02:23:07,510
We're so far from finished.
you know,

3017
02:23:07,530 --> 02:23:10,120
if we used to be monkeys and now we're 
at this,

3018
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:11,450
we're not done.
It's not.

3019
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:16,520
We're not stopping right here.
Whatever we're going to be a million 

3020
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:17,360
years from now is going to be very 
difficult to do.

3021
02:23:17,490 --> 02:23:19,980
It's going to be very difficult to 
compare to what we are today.

3022
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:21,420
We're gonna.
We're going gonna change.

3023
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:23,640
We're gonna evolve.
We have to this point,

3024
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:26,880
we're going to continue to do so.
Whether we evolve or they don't like the

3025
02:23:26,881 --> 02:23:31,881
word evolve,
they elect to use the word have only 

3026
02:23:31,881 --> 02:23:31,881
evolved with genetics,
advanced,

3027
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:34,050
advanced,
culturally advanced,

3028
02:23:34,051 --> 02:23:39,051
biologically advancing our understanding
of each other and advance even further 

3029
02:23:39,051 --> 02:23:41,310
in our ability to spread information.
We're not done.

3030
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:46,460
So the evil almost motivates that work.
It almost motivates that positive work 

3031
02:23:46,981 --> 02:23:47,880
to get things done.

3032
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:50,850
yeah,
because like the evil thing,

3033
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:54,990
after it's done killing everything good.
It like cancer,

3034
02:23:54,991 --> 02:23:56,970
the cancer cell,
and this is genetics.

3035
02:23:57,450 --> 02:24:02,190
It doesn't stop killing until the host 
is dead [inaudible] and then it,

3036
02:24:02,250 --> 02:24:05,580
you know,
it becomes the host and updates itself.

3037
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:06,780
It eats its own tail

3038
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:09,900
well and even on a different way of 
looking at it,

3039
02:24:09,901 --> 02:24:11,640
what we're talking about earlier about 
New York,

3040
02:24:11,641 --> 02:24:16,641
about people experiencing that horrible 
evil of this attack and thousands of 

3041
02:24:16,641 --> 02:24:18,990
people dead and then millions of people 
being friendly to each other.

3042
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:21,150
There's this burst in the other 
direction

3043
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:23,190
that was like,
to me that was like,

3044
02:24:23,191 --> 02:24:28,191
this is the messiah moment that first of
all that wall street appreciated the 

3045
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:32,700
work that people who do the actual work 
that makes things go.

3046
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:35,190
Like when they go to the wall and flip 
that switch.

3047
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:37,200
The people that make the electricity 
come,

3048
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:42,680
you know the people that raise their 
kids and put the food on their tables 

3049
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:45,981
and grow it.
Those people that do the actual work 

3050
02:24:45,981 --> 02:24:49,410
that they were being very appreciative 
and I thought this is a mind blowing 

3051
02:24:49,410 --> 02:24:51,330
fucking revolutionary moment in the 
United States.

3052
02:24:51,331 --> 02:24:55,740
History were bullshit is not walking and
bullshit is not talking,

3053
02:24:55,980 --> 02:25:00,980
but reality and reality is being honored
and people are so fucking happy.

3054
02:25:01,471 --> 02:25:03,660
Matt,
they were all smiling at each other.

3055
02:25:03,661 --> 02:25:06,780
They were tripping over themselves to 
give somebody a hand.

3056
02:25:07,110 --> 02:25:10,920
It was intense and I never will forget 
it neither.

3057
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:13,110
I won't forget it either.
I remember that feeling.

3058
02:25:13,111 --> 02:25:13,830
It was a very,
very,

3059
02:25:13,831 --> 02:25:18,831
very strange time and it didn't last,
but it let me know that that that time 

3060
02:25:18,831 --> 02:25:23,121
is possible,
that things like that can take place 

3061
02:25:23,121 --> 02:25:23,320
where people do wake up and kind of 
realize and think.

3062
02:25:23,321 --> 02:25:24,190
One of the big things

3063
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:29,190
was that it happened here.
We've been so lucky when you consider 

3064
02:25:29,190 --> 02:25:32,821
how much war the United States has been 
involved in and how little of it has 

3065
02:25:32,821 --> 02:25:34,810
been on the United States soil outside 
of pearl harbor,

3066
02:25:34,811 --> 02:25:39,811
which is barely on United States soil.
It's like it's in the middle of the 

3067
02:25:39,811 --> 02:25:39,811
ocean.
It's Hawaii,

3068
02:25:39,811 --> 02:25:41,020
Hawaii.
I think it should be its own nation.

3069
02:25:41,021 --> 02:25:43,540
I just do.
I think it is a totally unique thing.

3070
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:46,510
I think it should have its own,
you know,

3071
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:48,340
its own rules,
its own government.

3072
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:53,520
I think they need the United States 
money for certain things because of 

3073
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:53,550
that,
but fuck that.

3074
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:58,640
It's moved to where it's like the leader
of the United States because it's the 

3075
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:01,300
only place where either they've outlawed
gmos and China just said,

3076
02:26:01,301 --> 02:26:04,150
we're not going to buy any gmo,
so there you go.

3077
02:26:04,151 --> 02:26:09,151
There's a whole market there that Hawaii
is a very set up to be able to fulfill.

3078
02:26:11,230 --> 02:26:16,230
It's a paradise nation.
It's a paradise in the middle of the 

3079
02:26:16,230 --> 02:26:18,721
ocean.
The idea that it's a part of the United 

3080
02:26:18,721 --> 02:26:18,721
States,
it's crazy,

3081
02:26:18,721 --> 02:26:19,240
but they've been attacked.
Pearl harbor thing was the only time,

3082
02:26:19,510 --> 02:26:24,510
so we didn't have a point of reference,
so we're involved in all this shit 

3083
02:26:24,510 --> 02:26:26,170
that's going on over the globe where we 
are involved in Iraq.

3084
02:26:26,171 --> 02:26:31,171
We are involved in Afghanistan,
but you and I and everybody that's here 

3085
02:26:31,171 --> 02:26:31,180
in America,
we don't feel that.

3086
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:36,390
We don't.
Unless you have friends or loved ones 

3087
02:26:36,390 --> 02:26:36,390
that are over there,
you don't feel it.

3088
02:26:36,390 --> 02:26:39,690
I don't know.
I think people have send their children 

3089
02:26:39,690 --> 02:26:42,151
over there.
Those people feel like there's a bunch 

3090
02:26:42,221 --> 02:26:47,221
of people who,
who felt it and what's really sickening 

3091
02:26:47,221 --> 02:26:49,760
to me is that those people who sent 
their kids over there to fight for what,

3092
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:55,100
you know,
an idea that they agreed with and that 

3093
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:55,210
everybody agrees with,
that's what they were sold.

3094
02:26:55,210 --> 02:27:00,210
And that's what they did.
And then they come home to find that 

3095
02:27:00,210 --> 02:27:00,520
their pr,
their parents,

3096
02:27:00,521 --> 02:27:02,830
that class of people who've lost their 
homes.

3097
02:27:03,490 --> 02:27:05,800
I mean,
when people put that one together,

3098
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:07,590
I always hope,
you know,

3099
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:09,250
of course I want,
uh,

3100
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:14,140
the,
the american people deserve healthcare.

3101
02:27:14,290 --> 02:27:17,980
And if they had given us healthcare,
they wouldn't had any war in Iraq.

3102
02:27:17,981 --> 02:27:19,840
I want somebody to put that together 
too.

3103
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:25,320
That was all bankster bullshit to avoid 
paying for medicare for all because they

3104
02:27:26,830 --> 02:27:30,100
needed to get away from what they call a
socialist model.

3105
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:35,280
So they start breaking it down and it 
was all around healthcare and it would 

3106
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:38,350
have been a whole fuck of a lot cheaper 
to just give people healthcare.

3107
02:27:38,410 --> 02:27:39,400
But it wasn't,
it.

3108
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:44,490
It paid off those private contractors 
who go over to other countries and not 

3109
02:27:44,651 --> 02:27:48,100
only do they blow everything up,
but then they rebuild it.

3110
02:27:48,490 --> 02:27:51,310
Then they blow it up again and then they
rebuild it.

3111
02:27:51,650 --> 02:27:55,900
They're getting paid four times of doing
that because it's just a fucking scam.

3112
02:27:55,960 --> 02:28:00,960
When you say it's about healthcare,
meaning that they shifted where the 

3113
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:01,780
money would go,
that it would have to go to war.

3114
02:28:01,781 --> 02:28:03,070
so there wouldn't be money for health 
care.

3115
02:28:03,071 --> 02:28:06,760
It was up there because they didn't want
any socialist solution.

3116
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:09,430
I just say socialist solution,
they call it,

3117
02:28:09,790 --> 02:28:10,830
you know,
they,

3118
02:28:11,130 --> 02:28:16,130
they've got people thinking that 
socialism means you're behind barbed 

3119
02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:19,671
wire with a gun to your head or that 
you're weak and lazy and you don't want 

3120
02:28:19,671 --> 02:28:24,061
to do any work.
But that's how you fucking a middle 

3121
02:28:24,061 --> 02:28:24,061
class.
You take

3122
02:28:24,061 --> 02:28:24,140
the shit from the top and move it to the
middle.

3123
02:28:24,350 --> 02:28:26,960
So they just bullshitted everybody and 
you know,

3124
02:28:26,961 --> 02:28:29,600
they,
they use the way they always use.

3125
02:28:29,601 --> 02:28:32,560
They use a lot of racism and they use an
absolute classes,

3126
02:28:32,561 --> 02:28:37,561
um,
to divide people against each other and 

3127
02:28:37,561 --> 02:28:38,230
do their fundraising shit or you know,
they and,

3128
02:28:38,231 --> 02:28:42,740
and all the laws that they changed since
reagan were deregulation laws and it was

3129
02:28:42,741 --> 02:28:45,500
so that there were,
they deregulated the insurance company,

3130
02:28:45,501 --> 02:28:50,501
so like bosses can take peasant 
insurance out on their employees and so 

3131
02:28:50,501 --> 02:28:51,230
if they die,
they get a kickback,

3132
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:53,540
judges get a kickback,
you know,

3133
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:58,541
they took public money and put it in 
private pockets and they did it all 

3134
02:28:58,541 --> 02:29:02,430
through their lobbyists who sit in 
congress and have nothing to do with 

3135
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:03,320
serving the needs of the people who sent
them there.

3136
02:29:03,530 --> 02:29:06,420
Now that is some bullshit.
That's fucking hilarious.

3137
02:29:06,460 --> 02:29:11,460
What it is.
Sometimes you can write comedy like 

3138
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:11,460
that.

3139
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:11,460
Well,
it's,

3140
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:12,440
it's,
I don't think it's hilarious.

3141
02:29:12,441 --> 02:29:17,441
I think it's disgusting,
but I agree with you that it's 

3142
02:29:17,441 --> 02:29:17,441
hilarious.
I'll fucking transparent it is.

3143
02:29:17,441 --> 02:29:19,370
And I think that you breaking it down 
like that is going to let people sort of

3144
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:24,400
look at it from that point of view.
They got everybody fired by boat flagged

3145
02:29:24,820 --> 02:29:29,820
by both bible facts because you made me 
forget to verado nickname used to 

3146
02:29:34,910 --> 02:29:36,680
fucking catch phrases of bullshit

3147
02:29:37,910 --> 02:29:40,490
against it doesn't mean shit.
You're not going to get shit for it.

3148
02:29:40,630 --> 02:29:42,620
Right?
Your kid ain't going to get nowhere.

3149
02:29:42,621 --> 02:29:46,790
He's not getting any school.
But like I have made my family was like,

3150
02:29:46,791 --> 02:29:47,950
well,
we need to be able to.

3151
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:51,890
This was like it in Hawaii to where this
old lady gets up there.

3152
02:29:51,891 --> 02:29:53,390
It made me so fucking mad.
She goes,

3153
02:29:53,780 --> 02:29:58,780
I'm 82 years old and I'm a I a,
I may a gmo farmer.

3154
02:30:00,380 --> 02:30:01,660
And um,
you know,

3155
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:02,690
uh,
I made it to.

3156
02:30:02,691 --> 02:30:06,730
And if I didn't have my gmo crops,
I wouldn't be able to send my grandkids,

3157
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:09,110
my children to college.
And they get up there,

3158
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:11,990
their testimony.
I want to go to college.

3159
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:15,150
No,
but I go up there and go,

3160
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:20,360
I don't care how old you are,
you don't have the right to give my 

3161
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:23,310
grandkids asthma.
Hello?

3162
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:29,960
But they don't,
they don't commit to anything because 

3163
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:31,080
there are fucking on dope for one thing.
They're on all that fucking.

3164
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:36,110
They're depressed as fuck.
America takes two thirds of the world's 

3165
02:30:36,110 --> 02:30:39,621
antidepressants and then they got to 
antidepressant booster on top of every 

3166
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:44,670
year.
If it doesn't make you forget reality 

3167
02:30:44,670 --> 02:30:45,870
quick enough and you know,
they're just drowning in bullshit,

3168
02:30:45,871 --> 02:30:46,600
but they,
they,

3169
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:51,060
they want bullshit more than they want 
anything else.

3170
02:30:51,061 --> 02:30:53,730
It's like a fucking incredible 
addiction.

3171
02:30:54,090 --> 02:30:58,110
Give us our bullshit.
Give us our fucking bullshit.

3172
02:30:58,111 --> 02:31:02,140
But it's all fucking bullshit.
It's all fucking bullshit because it's.

3173
02:31:02,220 --> 02:31:03,000
Truth is scary

3174
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:08,310
because it's simple and they can't stand
simple because they don't feel smart and

3175
02:31:08,311 --> 02:31:13,311
less.
It's all convoluted labyrinths of 

3176
02:31:13,311 --> 02:31:13,311
bullshit.
The,

3177
02:31:13,311 --> 02:31:14,850
the,
the simple truth is fucking overwhelming

3178
02:31:14,851 --> 02:31:17,580
to them because they're fucking liars.
So they're like,

3179
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:18,960
hi,
how am I going to stand here?

3180
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:19,980
Have something to come

3181
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:22,470
out of my mouth.
How am I going to do that?

3182
02:31:22,471 --> 02:31:24,390
Um,
I won't be getting paid for that.

3183
02:31:24,470 --> 02:31:29,470
I mean,
the people themselves that are addicted 

3184
02:31:29,470 --> 02:31:29,470
to the bullshit,
like,

3185
02:31:29,470 --> 02:31:29,470
what?
What is,

3186
02:31:29,470 --> 02:31:31,080
what's feasible?
And that's why I say I don't use it.

3187
02:31:31,410 --> 02:31:34,070
They,
they have convoluted hope until people,

3188
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:34,440
oh,
you,

3189
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:39,670
there's hope that you're gonna make it.
There's hope you're going to climb out 

3190
02:31:39,670 --> 02:31:39,670
of that hole.
There's hope,

3191
02:31:39,670 --> 02:31:43,911
there's a payoff,
there's hope you're going to win in the 

3192
02:31:43,911 --> 02:31:43,911
casino.
There isn't any fucking hope.

3193
02:31:43,911 --> 02:31:45,330
All there is is just,
you know,

3194
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:50,480
united with other people helping each 
other to get rid of fucking criminals 

3195
02:31:50,480 --> 02:31:52,080
that are robbing us.
That's certainly the best hope.

3196
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:56,430
So I hope that people will fucking wake 
the fuck up.

3197
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:58,440
That's where I hope.
I think they are.

3198
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,090
I think.
I think they are.

3199
02:32:00,150 --> 02:32:02,220
I think that helped.
That'll become an internet meme.

3200
02:32:02,550 --> 02:32:07,550
What you just said.
Someone will take that and turn it into 

3201
02:32:07,550 --> 02:32:07,550
a clip.
It'll be a video and people say roseanne

3202
02:32:07,550 --> 02:32:11,100
barr brick shit down.
Going to say I liked doing it for people

3203
02:32:11,130 --> 02:32:11,860
because you know,
they,

3204
02:32:12,010 --> 02:32:17,010
you know,
because I can and I like to just go and 

3205
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:17,880
I'll read all the shit for you and I'll 
tell you what it means to.

3206
02:32:18,110 --> 02:32:19,290
Because I feel like,
hey,

3207
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:20,400
you know,
uh,

3208
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:24,960
that's the service I can provide.
Maybe I'm full of shit on some topics.

3209
02:32:24,961 --> 02:32:27,900
Look it up for yourself and then come 
back and tell me if I am or not.

3210
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:29,490
I'll listen.
But I mean,

3211
02:32:29,491 --> 02:32:33,810
somebody's got to put this complete 
system of obsolete bullshit.

3212
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:39,140
They start laughing at to scorn and 
fucking replace it with something that 

3213
02:32:39,140 --> 02:32:39,840
fucking makes sense.
I agree.

3214
02:32:39,841 --> 02:32:41,220
I just don't know how it's going to 
happen.

3215
02:32:41,540 --> 02:32:44,190
I wonder what's going to be the trigger.

3216
02:32:44,310 --> 02:32:49,310
I hope it's not something catastrophic.
Some some sort of big event that has to 

3217
02:32:49,310 --> 02:32:52,020
take place in order for them to rebuild 
the whole thing and try to do it in some

3218
02:32:52,021 --> 02:32:56,820
sort of ethical and moral way.
But I to do is write down the debt.

3219
02:32:56,821 --> 02:32:59,520
Like fdr did move the zero.
It's easy.

3220
02:32:59,521 --> 02:33:02,010
It's a fucking.
It's a pen on paper.

3221
02:33:02,011 --> 02:33:04,260
That's all they have to do.
If they want,

3222
02:33:04,290 --> 02:33:06,570
you know,
things to get better in a fucking hurry.

3223
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:10,320
They can write down the debt of the 
american people.

3224
02:33:10,321 --> 02:33:12,840
They can have a debt jubilee.
They can forgive the debt.

3225
02:33:12,841 --> 02:33:17,640
student loan debt.
They can do that or if they want to,

3226
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:20,400
it's totally possible.
Obama could like say,

3227
02:33:20,401 --> 02:33:21,840
you know what?
I'm kicking the federal.

3228
02:33:21,841 --> 02:33:23,610
Reserve the fuck out of here.
As a matter of fact,

3229
02:33:23,611 --> 02:33:27,990
I've been a nationalize it and I'm going
to nationalize monsanto too while I'm at

3230
02:33:27,991 --> 02:33:30,530
it because I have that kind of power 
under the theater.

3231
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:34,410
You going to do what you gotta do.
Well,

3232
02:33:34,411 --> 02:33:36,810
isn't that what happened to kennedy?
I think so,

3233
02:33:36,811 --> 02:33:41,811
but you got end lincoln and you gotta do
what you gotta do and those guys are 

3234
02:33:41,811 --> 02:33:41,811
frigging,
you know,

3235
02:33:41,811 --> 02:33:45,980
they did what they had to do and they,
you're going to get that fucking 

3236
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:45,980
clothes.
You know,

3237
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:48,930
it's not like you're going to top that.
It's not like you're going to be,

3238
02:33:48,931 --> 02:33:50,690
you know,
after you know,

3239
02:33:52,110 --> 02:33:55,140
nationalizing the federal reserve and 
monsanto.

3240
02:33:55,141 --> 02:34:00,141
You're never going to top that.
Did you think that getting a second 

3241
02:34:00,141 --> 02:34:03,891
fucking sitcom number one thing,
you only get that once he's there with 

3242
02:34:03,891 --> 02:34:05,820
the chance he could do it.
He could do something.

3243
02:34:05,821 --> 02:34:08,180
Did you think that it was going to be 
different when he got into office now?

3244
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:09,810
I hate.
I don't like him.

3245
02:34:09,811 --> 02:34:11,190
I knew,
I knew he was.

3246
02:34:11,191 --> 02:34:13,440
I ran against him.
I came in fifth.

3247
02:34:13,441 --> 02:34:16,650
I spent $0.
I came in fifth.

3248
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:19,780
I spent,
I raised no money and spent no money.

3249
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:22,080
I came in fifTh.
Wow.

3250
02:34:22,330 --> 02:34:23,260
But uh,
yeah,

3251
02:34:23,261 --> 02:34:25,890
I ran against him because I knew he was 
a lobbyist.

3252
02:34:25,891 --> 02:34:28,270
Like they all are.
There was no real leaders.

3253
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:33,570
I mean,
I think he's a smart lobbyists and I 

3254
02:34:33,570 --> 02:34:35,521
don't think he has any chance to,
to do what he does because he's in that 

3255
02:34:35,521 --> 02:34:35,521
system,
that system of,

3256
02:34:35,521 --> 02:34:37,810
of banksters who runs it

3257
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:39,630
against him in 2008.
Is that what it was?

3258
02:34:39,780 --> 02:34:40,410
TwElve.
Twelve.

3259
02:34:41,070 --> 02:34:42,600
Well,
when he was coming out in 2008,

3260
02:34:42,601 --> 02:34:44,010
did you have any belief in him?

3261
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:50,000
No,
I never have any belief in any 

3262
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:50,970
republican nor democrat.
I know they're just fucking lobbyists.

3263
02:34:51,690 --> 02:34:54,000
You know,
they're not real.

3264
02:34:54,001 --> 02:34:55,980
Even politicians,
you know,

3265
02:34:55,981 --> 02:34:58,290
they're just liars.
So basically it's fucking liars.

3266
02:34:58,500 --> 02:35:02,680
Politicians make bridges between 
communities and people for,

3267
02:35:02,830 --> 02:35:03,380
for,
you know,

3268
02:35:03,450 --> 02:35:07,320
money to come into that community.
These guys don't fucking do any of that.

3269
02:35:07,710 --> 02:35:10,230
They just take people's money and put it
in their friends pocket.

3270
02:35:10,470 --> 02:35:15,470
Like they know everything they do,
that they're not a,

3271
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:18,600
nothing they do is in the public 
interest or,

3272
02:35:18,601 --> 02:35:20,670
or for american citizens.

3273
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:27,640
I hope your optimism in people figuring 
it out is founded.

3274
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:33,060
Well,
I pray that they will because I want to 

3275
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:34,630
use that word because as long as there's
an old crabby,

3276
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:35,950
whatever,
I am,

3277
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:38,100
women like me,
you know,

3278
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:43,470
that are there,
that are able to come on anywheres and 

3279
02:35:43,470 --> 02:35:44,380
say,
I'm praying that people will wake up and

3280
02:35:44,381 --> 02:35:49,381
rejoin the human race.
I think that's a pretty free society 

3281
02:35:49,381 --> 02:35:49,840
that you're living in

3282
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:53,470
free as you can get in today's climate 
and and,

3283
02:35:53,471 --> 02:35:58,471
But you know,
they're working very hard to restrict 

3284
02:35:58,471 --> 02:36:00,571
those freedoms and that's what's scary 
about the nsa holding things on over 

3285
02:36:00,571 --> 02:36:01,660
people,
digging into your email,

3286
02:36:01,661 --> 02:36:03,970
being able to have things that they can 
pull on you.

3287
02:36:03,971 --> 02:36:08,971
Like you were saying before that they're
all a bunch of fucking people that have 

3288
02:36:08,971 --> 02:36:12,031
done shady shit and they know that they 
have secrets out there and they want to 

3289
02:36:12,031 --> 02:36:13,480
have your secrets as well and they want 
to hold them over your head and keep you

3290
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:16,460
from trying to change the system.
So when a person like you comes along,

3291
02:36:16,461 --> 02:36:18,260
that doesn't give a fuck,
that's,

3292
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:21,430
that's when the truth gets hurt.
When a person that doesn't have anything

3293
02:36:21,431 --> 02:36:21,910
to lose,

3294
02:36:21,990 --> 02:36:26,990
you have comic.
You got to tell you you can't get up 

3295
02:36:26,990 --> 02:36:28,370
here and then you can't fucking 
bullshit.

3296
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:31,290
You can'T live if you're just 
bullshitting people,

3297
02:36:31,291 --> 02:36:31,740
you know,
you,

3298
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:36,760
you want to hit them right fucking 
between the eyes and for me and like my 

3299
02:36:36,760 --> 02:36:37,380
idol,
dick gregory and other ones.

3300
02:36:37,620 --> 02:36:39,750
It's like I'm not even fucking make it 
funny.

3301
02:36:40,650 --> 02:36:45,600
I'm just going to say it to you because 
it's like you have people.

3302
02:36:45,630 --> 02:36:47,190
We have the power,
right?

3303
02:36:47,210 --> 02:36:48,990
We,
we have the power,

3304
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:52,470
we have all the power that it takes to,
uh,

3305
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:57,680
ensure that a better system is 
implemented with the least amount of 

3306
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:03,310
cruelty possible.
That's a great way you have it.

3307
02:37:03,900 --> 02:37:08,900
I believe we do.
Dick gregory was the guy for a lot of 

3308
02:37:08,900 --> 02:37:11,181
folks.
Don't know who put the zapruder film on 

3309
02:37:11,181 --> 02:37:11,181
television and made people.
Yeah,

3310
02:37:11,181 --> 02:37:12,770
he was the guy in 1970.
Actually.

3311
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:16,100
It was a long after a 70.
Something might not be me.

3312
02:37:16,170 --> 02:37:19,070
It might have been 71.
It was right after,

3313
02:37:19,071 --> 02:37:19,650
um,
uh,

3314
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:21,290
it was on the geraldo rivera show 
actually.

3315
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:24,350
They showed the zapruder film live on 
television,

3316
02:37:24,351 --> 02:37:29,351
and back then geraldo was this 
antigovernment guy who's just like 

3317
02:37:29,351 --> 02:37:30,500
really controversial character.
Look,

3318
02:37:30,501 --> 02:37:32,300
we can waTch it right here.
What year was it,

3319
02:37:32,740 --> 02:37:33,860
jamie?
Back that up real quick.

3320
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:36,800
Just put on the back it up to the 
beginning.

3321
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:43,150
Okay.
Straight out that if you are at all 

3322
02:37:43,150 --> 02:37:44,090
sensitive,
uh,

3323
02:37:44,091 --> 02:37:48,050
if your idol queasy then don't watch 
this film.

3324
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:50,680
Just putting on the late night.

3325
02:37:51,220 --> 02:37:56,220
They're going to show this film.
This is geraldo rivera back when he was 

3326
02:37:56,220 --> 02:37:58,870
super slick with a beautiful mustache 
and lovely hair.

3327
02:37:59,020 --> 02:38:01,960
And it was called good night America.
And it was geraldo show.

3328
02:38:01,961 --> 02:38:06,550
He was the most radical did he was a 
young man and he was a wild fuck.

3329
02:38:07,090 --> 02:38:10,060
He was very different than he is now.
His little fox news.

3330
02:38:11,010 --> 02:38:11,630
Bruter film.

3331
02:38:12,860 --> 02:38:17,860
Dick gregory got ahold of this video.
Time magazine owned it from 1963 on 

3332
02:38:18,111 --> 02:38:20,600
zapruder.
Submitted it to them in 1963.

3333
02:38:20,601 --> 02:38:24,290
They bought it and then no one released 
it until 1970.

3334
02:38:24,291 --> 02:38:25,340
What was it?
Seventy what?

3335
02:38:25,730 --> 02:38:27,710
Seventy five.
So think about that.

3336
02:38:27,990 --> 02:38:31,610
You're talking about eight years after 
the murder was the first time it gets on

3337
02:38:31,611 --> 02:38:32,420
tv,
and here it is.

3338
02:38:32,980 --> 02:38:36,860
This is the first time people see 
kennedy's head explode on television and

3339
02:38:36,861 --> 02:38:41,410
go back into the left.
They'd never seen that before and

3340
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:46,110
that all of the shots were fired from 
behind by lee harvey oswald alone,

3341
02:38:46,270 --> 02:38:51,090
assassin firing at the president,
and as you could see clearly the head is

3342
02:38:51,091 --> 02:38:53,460
thrown violently backwards.
Can completely.

3343
02:38:54,220 --> 02:38:55,570
That's a dIck.
Gregory.

3344
02:38:55,630 --> 02:38:57,250
Dick gregory.
Put that on television.

3345
02:38:57,490 --> 02:39:00,300
So your hero was responsible for 
something you didn't even know about.

3346
02:39:00,310 --> 02:39:05,310
That was one of the big moments where 
people in the United States started 

3347
02:39:05,310 --> 02:39:05,310
going,
what?

3348
02:39:05,950 --> 02:39:08,190
The kennedy assassination was the one 
for me when I was.

3349
02:39:08,530 --> 02:39:10,870
I was living in New York and my friend 
john,

3350
02:39:11,370 --> 02:39:16,370
he had this buddy who was over the house
who had this book that was a fucking 

3351
02:39:16,370 --> 02:39:16,660
wave it around talking all this crazy 
shit about this book.

3352
02:39:16,740 --> 02:39:19,210
It was called best evidence by this guy 
david lifton.

3353
02:39:19,510 --> 02:39:22,960
David liftin was an accountant start 
going over the warren commission reports

3354
02:39:22,961 --> 02:39:27,961
and he was one of the only guys that was
anal enough to go through all fucking 

3355
02:39:27,961 --> 02:39:31,111
who knows how many hundreds and hundreds
of pages and find all these 

3356
02:39:31,111 --> 02:39:33,820
inconsistencies and contradictions and 
all this hypocrisy and craziness and all

3357
02:39:33,821 --> 02:39:35,080
incorrect shit,
and he.

3358
02:39:35,081 --> 02:39:40,081
He made like a long list of what it was 
and explained and then went on this 

3359
02:39:40,390 --> 02:39:45,390
lifelong quest to get to the bottom of 
what happened during the kennedy 

3360
02:39:45,390 --> 02:39:47,320
assassination and the result was this 
book called best evidence that is one of

3361
02:39:47,321 --> 02:39:52,270
the most analytical books ever and 
analytical about the crime in a way that

3362
02:39:52,271 --> 02:39:54,340
was not emotional.

3363
02:39:54,490 --> 02:39:59,490
IT wasn't theatrical,
wasn't trying to lead you in one 

3364
02:39:59,490 --> 02:40:02,131
direction or the other.
It was just simply stating the facts 

3365
02:40:02,131 --> 02:40:04,000
like the reason why the single bullet 
theory was concocted in the first place.

3366
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:09,120
The single bullet itself appearing on 
connelly's gurney magically at the 

3367
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:13,381
hospital and being responsible for going
through to people's bodies and leaving 

3368
02:40:13,381 --> 02:40:15,270
more in residue of the bullets and 
connally's body.

3369
02:40:15,271 --> 02:40:17,460
Then was missing from the actual bullet 
itself.

3370
02:40:17,490 --> 02:40:22,490
So much horseshit involved in the 
concoction of the single bullet theory 

3371
02:40:22,490 --> 02:40:24,660
in the first place because they only did
it because they had a.

3372
02:40:24,750 --> 02:40:28,110
They had a makeup for a guy getting hit 
with a ricochet and the underpass.

3373
02:40:28,470 --> 02:40:33,470
A guy went to the hospital and he got 
hit and he was doing interviews and 

3374
02:40:33,470 --> 02:40:36,141
talking about it.
He got hit with a bullet that hit the 

3375
02:40:36,141 --> 02:40:36,141
curb stone and the ricochet hit him in 
the head so he.

3376
02:40:36,141 --> 02:40:40,370
This guy had to be treated so they had 
to account for that bullet and one of 

3377
02:40:40,370 --> 02:40:41,610
the ways the accounted for that bullet,
it was all these different wounds on two

3378
02:40:41,611 --> 02:40:43,800
different people.
They attributed in the one bullet.

3379
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:45,390
Instead of saying,
hey man,

3380
02:40:45,391 --> 02:40:47,490
maybe they're getting shot from all over
the place.

3381
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:49,860
We were getting shot from the front and 
shot from the back.

3382
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:55,400
They tied it all together.
The first bullet hole and kennedy's 

3383
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:55,400
neck.
They turned thAt into a trake wound.

3384
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:58,650
It's a different wound in the protest.
The Maryland hospital as it is,

3385
02:40:58,651 --> 02:41:03,651
and the dallas hospital.
The way it was described in the dallas 

3386
02:41:03,651 --> 02:41:04,440
hospital was an entry wound.
The way it was described in bethesda,

3387
02:41:04,470 --> 02:41:09,470
Maryland,
by the time they got ahold of the body 

3388
02:41:09,470 --> 02:41:09,510
and fluid across the country,
they turned it into a tracheotomy.

3389
02:41:09,810 --> 02:41:11,790
You don't do a tracheotomy and a guy who
doesn't have a head,

3390
02:41:12,090 --> 02:41:15,470
the guy's dead,
never heard any of this.

3391
02:41:15,630 --> 02:41:19,290
They had to make something.
They had to account for the fact that he

3392
02:41:19,291 --> 02:41:22,050
had a hole in his neck,
so they turned it into a trake wound.

3393
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:24,060
You've got shot from a bunch of 
different angles.

3394
02:41:24,330 --> 02:41:26,070
There's probably several people shooting
at them.

3395
02:41:26,071 --> 02:41:27,660
One of them might've been lee harvey 
oswald.

3396
02:41:27,870 --> 02:41:29,490
It's not an either or.
You know,

3397
02:41:29,491 --> 02:41:31,130
people say lee harvey oswald acted 
alone.

3398
02:41:31,290 --> 02:41:33,980
I don't know.
He might've acted that either or thing.

3399
02:41:34,060 --> 02:41:39,060
That's that binary mind control thing.
so you'd go back and forth like you're 

3400
02:41:39,060 --> 02:41:39,060
getting all bipolar,
you know,

3401
02:41:39,450 --> 02:41:42,380
going back and forth,
but you don't see the real truths.

3402
02:41:42,381 --> 02:41:43,680
Right?
Right there in your face.

3403
02:41:43,681 --> 02:41:45,540
Here's the,
here's some real facts of it.

3404
02:41:45,930 --> 02:41:49,800
Not that those aren't real facts,
but that Gerald Ford was the head of the

3405
02:41:49,801 --> 02:41:53,180
warren commission that you know,
came out with a,

3406
02:41:53,181 --> 02:41:58,181
a certain report and then became the 
analects and president of the United 

3407
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:00,460
States for a lot

3408
02:42:01,010 --> 02:42:02,240
the creep,
arlen specter,

3409
02:42:02,241 --> 02:42:07,241
he was on the warrant commission.
THe warren commission was filled with 

3410
02:42:07,241 --> 02:42:10,031
criminals and crazy people,
mad men that were designed to 

3411
02:42:10,031 --> 02:42:11,630
disseminate propaganda and dress it up 
as the truth.

3412
02:42:11,750 --> 02:42:16,750
Whoever killed kennedy,
whether it was lee harvey oswald 

3413
02:42:16,750 --> 02:42:18,080
delivered the shot or the idea that what
we're getting is the truth,

3414
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:23,170
the whole truth and nothing,
but that's the most hilarious thing 

3415
02:42:23,170 --> 02:42:23,170
ever.
Why would they ever do that?

3416
02:42:23,170 --> 02:42:25,000
I don't know,
but I agree with you,

3417
02:42:25,030 --> 02:42:30,030
but did you see obama shaking raul 
castro's hand at mandela's funeral 

3418
02:42:30,030 --> 02:42:30,520
though?
No.

3419
02:42:30,730 --> 02:42:31,720
Did you hear about that?

3420
02:42:31,850 --> 02:42:36,850
No,
but did you see the guy who was doing 

3421
02:42:36,850 --> 02:42:37,640
the fucking translation,
the sign language at mandela's funeral?

3422
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:40,280
Just making shit up.
TO me,

3423
02:42:40,340 --> 02:42:45,340
that shows where there's a problem with 
conspiracy theory that most of the time 

3424
02:42:45,340 --> 02:42:49,240
it's in competence.
It's human and competence more than 

3425
02:42:49,240 --> 02:42:51,881
anything else.
And when you got a guy that's just 

3426
02:42:51,881 --> 02:42:54,131
making up sign language,
shit standing three feet away from the 

3427
02:42:54,131 --> 02:42:54,131
president who,
oh,

3428
02:42:54,131 --> 02:42:54,650
by the way,
when you go back in his past,

3429
02:42:54,651 --> 02:42:59,651
turns out that he was arrested for 
murder and he might've been also 

3430
02:42:59,651 --> 02:43:00,950
responsible for rape.
So it's like all these crazy accusations

3431
02:43:00,951 --> 02:43:02,120
about this guy,
he's a violence,

3432
02:43:02,121 --> 02:43:07,121
gets a frantic.
He'd already been arrested at one other 

3433
02:43:07,121 --> 02:43:07,121
time for doing that.
Very same thing.

3434
02:43:07,121 --> 02:43:08,480
He got in trouble rather for doing that 
very same thing.

3435
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:11,170
He did it before.
I don't know how he got there.

3436
02:43:11,171 --> 02:43:16,171
I don't know who hired him,
but he had done that before we had gone 

3437
02:43:16,171 --> 02:43:16,171
up and pretended to be a sign language 
guy.

3438
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:18,230
He's like,
maybe they're given all,

3439
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:23,420
maybe they're telling obama something.
Because remember when you went to south 

3440
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:25,440
America and his guys got busted for the 
prostitutes.

3441
02:43:25,980 --> 02:43:27,930
Well that was actually secret service 
people.

3442
02:43:28,190 --> 02:43:33,190
But I mean,
well maybe some of the people that get 

3443
02:43:33,190 --> 02:43:35,891
next to them,
they're not really being vetted very 

3444
02:43:35,891 --> 02:43:35,891
well.

3445
02:43:35,891 --> 02:43:36,120
I certainly think so.
I think it's incompetence.

3446
02:43:36,300 --> 02:43:37,170
Like,
like I was saying,

3447
02:43:37,171 --> 02:43:42,171
I think there's more than competence in 
government than we would ever imagine 

3448
02:43:42,171 --> 02:43:45,880
and when you see that,
because you can tell that the smart 

3449
02:43:45,880 --> 02:43:46,680
guide,
the wizards there,

3450
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:50,040
dumb,
well they're smart in some ways,

3451
02:43:50,041 --> 02:43:51,750
but I think in order to fuck people 
over,

3452
02:43:51,751 --> 02:43:53,430
you have to be a liar in order to be a 
lawyer.

3453
02:43:53,431 --> 02:43:55,650
You got a lot of yourself.
I don't think there's any people,

3454
02:43:55,740 --> 02:44:00,740
any people that are dishonest,
that are honest with themselves because 

3455
02:44:00,740 --> 02:44:03,291
if they're honest with themselves,
they would recognize the terrible 

3456
02:44:03,291 --> 02:44:05,811
feeling that comes along with leaving,
leaving a legacy of of sadness and 

3457
02:44:05,811 --> 02:44:10,761
destruction behind you.
leaving a legacy of people upset about 

3458
02:44:10,761 --> 02:44:10,980
your,
your personal actions.

3459
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:13,200
That's not a Way to be in harmony with 
life.

3460
02:44:13,201 --> 02:44:15,280
That's not a way to be happy and that's 
why people,

3461
02:44:15,350 --> 02:44:17,930
but it is for those people.
Like you said earlier,

3462
02:44:17,931 --> 02:44:19,400
that are like,
I just want to get over.

3463
02:44:19,610 --> 02:44:21,950
That is a joy for them.
I don't think so.

3464
02:44:21,951 --> 02:44:26,450
In that way,
I think those people are either die that

3465
02:44:26,451 --> 02:44:31,451
way.
I just ride that bitch right into the 

3466
02:44:31,451 --> 02:44:31,451
beach.
I got my fuck you.

3467
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:32,840
That's all there is,

3468
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:38,440
I think.
I think even those people are not 

3469
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:40,480
optimally happy and they they probably 
in some way in the back of the head 

3470
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:40,970
realized that maybe they drank it away,
maybe they pill it away,

3471
02:44:41,330 --> 02:44:46,330
but the way to be happy is to make 
people around you feel happy and that's 

3472
02:44:46,330 --> 02:44:46,550
not the way to do it.
Just by fucking people over and when you

3473
02:44:46,551 --> 02:44:50,270
have a million dollars or a billion 
dollars and you got so much money in the

3474
02:44:50,271 --> 02:44:55,271
bank that you can't even spend it all.
You're not going to notice the 

3475
02:44:55,271 --> 02:44:58,391
victories.
What you're doing is just continuing to 

3476
02:44:58,391 --> 02:44:58,391
play the game.
Damn,

3477
02:44:58,391 --> 02:45:00,080
that's really true.
When you became super wealthy,

3478
02:45:00,350 --> 02:45:04,990
do you mean you went from being this 
person who struggled with and you know,

3479
02:45:05,010 --> 02:45:10,010
we're,
we're really fucking in in poverty and 

3480
02:45:10,010 --> 02:45:10,010
then all of a sudden,
boom,

3481
02:45:10,010 --> 02:45:10,790
insane,
incredible wealth.

3482
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:14,350
Once the dust settles you still,
roseanne is still rosanna.

3483
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:16,280
You got to deal with new bullshit,
but you're still,

3484
02:45:16,281 --> 02:45:16,640
you.

3485
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:19,480
I don't know if I'm still me.
You don't know if he's still doing it.

3486
02:45:19,481 --> 02:45:21,670
Destroyed my nervous system.
I know that.

3487
02:45:21,671 --> 02:45:24,310
I love to charge a harrison said that 
one time,

3488
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:26,680
but they said the beetle thing and he's 
like,

3489
02:45:26,681 --> 02:45:31,681
well,
the cost was our nervous system because 

3490
02:45:31,681 --> 02:45:31,681
of the fame.
The pressure.

3491
02:45:31,681 --> 02:45:32,380
Yeah.
It's a lot of pressure.

3492
02:45:32,480 --> 02:45:35,680
It's a lot of fame and you know,
I couldn't handle it.

3493
02:45:35,740 --> 02:45:38,380
I didn't know if I can even know what 
the fuck it was.

3494
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:44,160
And um,
it just seemed like another bullshit 

3495
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:44,160
thing.

3496
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:44,160
How old were you when you,
when you hit,

3497
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:47,660
when it really got crazy.
So that's the same thing

3498
02:45:47,950 --> 02:45:50,080
saying I did.
I was like,

3499
02:45:50,081 --> 02:45:51,010
uh,
you know.

3500
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:53,110
Yeah,
I did go all the way.

3501
02:45:53,120 --> 02:45:55,300
fucking nuts.
First thing I did,

3502
02:45:55,301 --> 02:46:00,301
I started like a given.
I started giving away the fucking money 

3503
02:46:00,370 --> 02:46:05,370
because I have like basic beliefs.
Of course they were all sold out and 

3504
02:46:05,370 --> 02:46:07,570
compromise now I was like,
okay,

3505
02:46:07,571 --> 02:46:09,520
you know,
you gotta you do this,

3506
02:46:09,521 --> 02:46:14,521
set this up.
But I set up all of these crazy fucking 

3507
02:46:14,521 --> 02:46:17,060
nonprofit organizations.
I used my money to like,

3508
02:46:17,061 --> 02:46:17,810
you know,
uh,

3509
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:19,430
try,
try to do what I,

3510
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:23,330
what I really thought I could,
you know,

3511
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:28,390
blows against the empire shit.
And that was so fun because it's lIke 

3512
02:46:28,390 --> 02:46:30,230
being a pirate or something,
but yeah,

3513
02:46:30,231 --> 02:46:31,880
of course there's a certain time where 
it's like,

3514
02:46:31,881 --> 02:46:34,780
you know what,
I'm getting a face lift.

3515
02:46:36,330 --> 02:46:39,560
And then it was like,
then I got all gm mode like that.

3516
02:46:39,561 --> 02:46:42,900
I get,
I got fucking gem mode.

3517
02:46:42,901 --> 02:46:46,270
It was exciting and especially because 
the pills I gave you,

3518
02:46:46,340 --> 02:46:49,610
they give you these fucking awesome 
painkillers and shit.

3519
02:46:50,290 --> 02:46:53,300
So I just kept having more and more 
surgery and you know,

3520
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:56,020
there,
there was a lot of uh,

3521
02:46:56,810 --> 02:47:00,200
psychotropic drugs and like I used 
fucking three or four.

3522
02:47:00,390 --> 02:47:03,980
I about 15 nervous breakdowns.
Luckily no one noticed.

3523
02:47:06,460 --> 02:47:09,490
Don't worry my fucking family around me 
noticing any difference.

3524
02:47:09,540 --> 02:47:14,540
Wow.
But you categorize that miss nervous 

3525
02:47:14,540 --> 02:47:14,540
breakdowns?
Yeah,

3526
02:47:14,540 --> 02:47:17,480
they were a shitload of them.
It's a lot of pressure.

3527
02:47:17,910 --> 02:47:18,830
A lot.
It's,

3528
02:47:19,220 --> 02:47:20,720
it's not fun.
I mean,

3529
02:47:20,721 --> 02:47:25,721
I,
I admire people who are handling it 

3530
02:47:25,721 --> 02:47:25,721
well,
but why don't you get up to that certain

3531
02:47:25,721 --> 02:47:26,300
level.
I mean,

3532
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:28,670
you know,
I'm just saying a lot of people,

3533
02:47:28,671 --> 02:47:31,670
they don't survive that level.
And I would see that,

3534
02:47:31,671 --> 02:47:32,300
you know,
that

3535
02:47:32,730 --> 02:47:36,810
like when you see a miley cyrus going 
crazy or a justin bieber going crazy and

3536
02:47:36,840 --> 02:47:38,520
everybody has their own criticisms of 
them,

3537
02:47:38,521 --> 02:47:40,220
you have a particular way of looking at 
it.

3538
02:47:40,230 --> 02:47:40,930
We like god,
you know,

3539
02:47:40,931 --> 02:47:42,300
you don't know what the fuck they're 
dealing with.

3540
02:47:42,330 --> 02:47:43,800
No one knows.
No one undersTands.

3541
02:47:43,980 --> 02:47:45,600
You understand in a way that most 
people,

3542
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:46,370
yeah,
they,

3543
02:47:46,371 --> 02:47:48,200
they,
they can't trust anybody.

3544
02:47:48,250 --> 02:47:50,350
Everyone's crazy and their life is 
crazy.

3545
02:47:50,351 --> 02:47:51,490
The reality is crazy.

3546
02:47:51,580 --> 02:47:52,390
Well,
you know,

3547
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:57,440
they're just around so many vultures in 
and a crepe zoids um,

3548
02:47:58,120 --> 02:47:59,990
you know,
they don't know what the way,

3549
02:48:00,030 --> 02:48:02,200
I don't know if they're coming or going,

3550
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:07,420
plus the amount of fucking,
just the impact of all those people 

3551
02:48:07,420 --> 02:48:07,620
staring at you all the time.
And everywhere you go,

3552
02:48:07,621 --> 02:48:12,621
you goT,
especially now the paparazzi and their 

3553
02:48:12,621 --> 02:48:14,791
face everywhere.
Like justin bieber can take a shit 

3554
02:48:14,791 --> 02:48:14,791
without someone having a camera in the 
toilet.

3555
02:48:14,791 --> 02:48:15,930
And that's just the way it is with that 
life.

3556
02:48:16,230 --> 02:48:18,090
And most people can't handle that.

3557
02:48:18,130 --> 02:48:23,130
That's like a stocking,
like the media they want to stock yet 

3558
02:48:23,130 --> 02:48:24,940
because they want,
they want to destroy you on camera,

3559
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:26,470
cause that'd be some good ratings.

3560
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:27,870
Well they also feel like they're allowed
to.

3561
02:48:27,930 --> 02:48:32,930
They're allowed to just shove cameras in
your face because you're the famous 

3562
02:48:32,930 --> 02:48:32,930
person.

3563
02:48:32,930 --> 02:48:33,090
Yeah.
I wasn't first star that,

3564
02:48:33,530 --> 02:48:34,290
uh,
you know,

3565
02:48:34,291 --> 02:48:37,230
I mean I had to pay a large amount of 
money in settlement,

3566
02:48:37,740 --> 02:48:42,740
but I did make the mistake of hiring 
some fucking guns to beat the fuck out 

3567
02:48:45,391 --> 02:48:49,380
of some paparazzi and how much you have 
to pay for that.

3568
02:48:49,410 --> 02:48:50,640
Oh,
I hAd to pay them all.

3569
02:48:50,650 --> 02:48:52,290
A few thousand.
That's worth it.

3570
02:48:52,320 --> 02:48:54,590
All the pop razzies kind of cash you 
got.

3571
02:48:54,620 --> 02:48:55,230
That's worth.
While.

3572
02:48:55,231 --> 02:48:57,680
This was way back when,
way back when,

3573
02:48:57,690 --> 02:49:00,620
the good old days when I had to pay some
money.

3574
02:49:03,470 --> 02:49:04,110
I was like,
yeah,

3575
02:49:04,111 --> 02:49:06,870
these fucking people just fucking.
They're jumping on my.

3576
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:08,020
I mean,
you,

3577
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:10,680
you don't know what it's like when you 
were like panicked because you know,

3578
02:49:10,770 --> 02:49:15,770
you're trying to leave a crowd and 
you're in your car and they're fucking 

3579
02:49:15,770 --> 02:49:17,600
jumping on your car and they're being 
encouraged to jump on your car and shit.

3580
02:49:18,630 --> 02:49:19,920
It's like,
you know,

3581
02:49:20,070 --> 02:49:21,030
and uh,
you know,

3582
02:49:21,031 --> 02:49:24,930
some farm boys knocked on my window and 
I roll it down and then they're like,

3583
02:49:24,990 --> 02:49:27,990
do you want us to beat the fuck out of 
them were from fucking Iowa?

3584
02:49:29,550 --> 02:49:30,480
Yes,
I do,

3585
02:49:30,481 --> 02:49:35,481
sir.
They got that hay bale and strength and 

3586
02:49:35,481 --> 02:49:36,870
they just moved them out of the way so I
could leave,

3587
02:49:36,871 --> 02:49:38,340
but I was a sitting duck,
you know,

3588
02:49:38,350 --> 02:49:41,670
that kind of shit was weird.
how often are you in California?

3589
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:42,850
You know,
I,

3590
02:49:42,851 --> 02:49:45,550
I come here every now and then.
Will you,

3591
02:49:45,560 --> 02:49:46,840
will you come back?
We do this again?

3592
02:49:46,841 --> 02:49:47,880
Yeah,
it was fun.

3593
02:49:47,970 --> 02:49:50,250
I enjoyed it very much.
I enjoyed being with you.

3594
02:49:50,670 --> 02:49:52,020
It was a,
and I said,

3595
02:49:52,021 --> 02:49:54,900
for me as a,
as a standup comedian is a honor because

3596
02:49:54,910 --> 02:49:59,580
I really do.
I'm a very emotional by my nuts.

3597
02:49:59,700 --> 02:50:00,610
