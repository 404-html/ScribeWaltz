00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,070
I was lucky enough to fight there in 2004,

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,340
2005 and we were pulling
40,000 people every show.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,220
We had a live 40,000 people and that
you'd walk out to the arena and then you

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:17,950
check out the stage and sometimes you
come up through the floor for your walkout

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,803
or a kid.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,640
It was just unbelievable.

8
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,790
They had like some elevator that would
make you rise up through the floor.

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,940
I remember in the back room once I was
trying to find the stairs and I've asked

10
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:27,241
the lady,

11
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:27,480
Whoa,

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,080
where do I go?

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,441
And she goes,

14
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:28,561
oh,

15
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,394
stand on that thing.

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:29,940
It's like,

17
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,751
no way.

18
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,320
And she goes,

19
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,891
Oh yes.

20
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:32,310
It's like,

21
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,143
fuck yes.

22
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,663
Um,

23
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,050
I remember coming up through the floor
and then all of a sudden they're all,

24
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,960
there's 40,000 people
right in front of you.

25
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:40,320
And it's like,

26
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,080
wow,

27
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,030
he's amazing.

28
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,590
And then we had a TV audience of
20 million people in Tokyo also.

29
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,330
So it would be a delayed
broadcast by about an hour.

30
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,640
So by the time we finished our fight
and then on the bus with a TV on the bus

31
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,120
and watch pretty much what you'll find
your way back on the way to the hotel.

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,400
But Thailand was pretty cool to Thailand,

33
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,500
wouldn't have crowds.

34
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,270
I'm song troy who was fighting for,

35
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,104
he'd have,

36
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,420
he'd make all these money
from the TV production,

37
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,310
so he did live shows in the middle of
nowhere and people will drive for hours to

38
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,220
be present to,

39
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,113
for a live event.

40
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,680
And we'd have 40,000,

41
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,543
60,000.

42
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,290
Um,

43
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,680
there's this one big event once a year
called the king's birthday and we get

44
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,170
100,000 people plus every
year on the fifth of December.

45
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,800
I was lucky to fight on
then four years in a row.

46
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,230
So the first time I went on the ring,

47
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,190
it was the first time that I owe my
knees went weak because as far as I could

48
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,360
see was the ocean heads.

49
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,830
And I started trembling.

50
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,930
And then I've come out in the first round.

51
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,440
I've tried this,

52
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,790
I've tried to finish him.

53
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,710
And then by the fifth round I sort of
spent my pennies and fell over a couple of

54
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:44,790
times and then I'm losing them points.

55
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,860
And then the next year I
got invited back and I said,

56
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:47,161
oh no,

57
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,750
I'm not going to get spooked at this time,

58
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,150
this time.

59
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,370
Like,

60
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,430
like the UFC Gds,

61
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,450
like you're talking about all the time.

62
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,580
I had the GDS,

63
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:52,941
the first one,

64
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:53,550
the second time it's like,

65
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,790
no,

66
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,020
I'm not gonna I'm going to this time,

67
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,610
I'm going to love it and
I'm going to absorb it.

68
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,050
I'm going to run with it.

69
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,884
So I've got out there,

70
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,780
big breath in 100,000 people.

71
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,591
And then,

72
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:01,801
um,

73
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,120
I had the greatest fight of my life.

74
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:05,130
That was 10 western is verse 10 toys.

75
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:08,820
And I was the only western
of I get getting high fire
from ties back the change

76
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:09,420
room.

77
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,620
And then the last time I did it,

78
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,250
um,

79
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,220
there was probably only
25,000 people a little tiny.

80
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,470
And I was looking at the background.

81
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:15,900
Ah,

82
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,290
Geez.

83
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:16,611
What's going on?

84
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:17,371
Where is everyone?

85
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,090
This is,

86
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,910
this is,

87
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,743
this is sad.

88
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,150
It was nuts.

89
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,520
But you can tell the
difference between $95,000,

90
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,380
$100,000.

91
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,660
Uh,

92
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,010
there was,

93
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,280
there was a little spot near the hot
dog stand where you could have another

94
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,461
5,000 people.

95
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:29,910
Easy.

96
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,511
Absolutely.

97
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:35,511
I was in an elevator one time with a guy
and he recognized me as a comedian and

98
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,890
he wanted to do one of my bits to me,

99
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,310
but he got it wrong and the bit was just
a little bit I used to do about saying

100
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:45,060
you too,

101
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,893
at the wrong time,

102
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,350
getting out of a cab at the airport and
the driver goes to have a nice flight.

103
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,223
You Go Yuto.

104
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,970
So,

105
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,803
so that's the bit.

106
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,080
So I'm in the elevator with him,

107
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,160
this guy.

108
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,760
And he goes,

109
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,001
Oh,

110
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:54,781
you're a comedian,

111
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:54,951
right?

112
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:55,171
And said,

113
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:55,890
yeah,

114
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,071
yeah.

115
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:56,521
How you doing?

116
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:56,671
You know,

117
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:57,210
when he goes,

118
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,901
you're the guide,

119
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,680
it says and you all the time.

120
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,400
So I'm not going to call them out on it.

121
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,061
I'm honored.

122
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,570
Even knows who I am so I'm not
going to embarrass somebody.

123
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:06,761
Said,

124
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:06,941
yeah,

125
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:07,510
that's me,

126
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,170
that's me.

127
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,621
And he goes,

128
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,011
yeah.

129
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:09,341
He goes,

130
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,510
I do that all the time.

131
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
I'm always saying,

132
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,730
and you at the wrong time,

133
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,240
and now I'm like,

134
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,451
no,

135
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:13,870
I shouldn't,

136
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,180
I should have corrected the guy.

137
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,840
You know what I mean?

138
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:17,231
And he goes,

139
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,064
yeah,

140
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,550
there's probably not a day
goes by that I don't yell and,

141
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,740
and you and I'm thinking this
is getting off the tracks.

142
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,620
So the elevator door opens,

143
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:30,250
it's in a casino with a bunch of
people and we walk off the elevator,

144
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,690
I'm going one way and
he goes the other way.

145
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,690
So he starts yelling to me thinking it's
gonna be funny what he thinks is my bit

146
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,470
in a casino now with hundreds of
people and he's going and you know,

147
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,540
and you know,

148
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,190
and I'm thinking I'm the only guy here
who knows what this guy's talking about

149
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,740
and I don't know what he's talking about.

150
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,323
He

151
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,391
was very,

152
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,224
very straight.

153
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,910
You can run into people man,

154
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,220
and you just use the egg
when you should've zagged.

155
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,850
And you run into someone who's completely
out of their fucking mind and then

156
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,020
they become a part of your life.

157
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:05,560
I mean,

158
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,393
that can happen.

159
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,590
You could definitely run
into the wrong people,

160
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,940
especially if it's a girl,

161
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,380
especially if you're single.

162
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:11,921
He just,

163
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,970
for whatever reason,

164
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,800
start talking to someone and it turns
out they're fucking crazy and then you,

165
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:17,634
you know,

166
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,090
that's a problem with men.

167
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,590
Men are willing to.

168
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,870
We're willing to look past a
lot of shit of a chick's hot.

169
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,110
Like I know a lot of guys that have
gotten involved with girls that are just

170
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,730
completely out of their fucking mind,

171
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,860
but they're pretty and they're just like,

172
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,200
oh,

173
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,030
hey,

174
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,841
she's a little weird,

175
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,200
but no,

176
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,570
no.

177
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,080
She was a guy who would
be running from her.

178
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,700
Imagine if that was a gal and she beat.

179
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:42,960
She had giant tits and I'd
be running back to answer.

180
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,691
Exactly.

181
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:43,841
Yeah,

182
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,411
that's me.

183
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,244
I'm that guy.

184
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,083
Hey

185
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,851
Man,

186
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:49,720
let's do it up.

187
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,510
Take it to a restaurant.

188
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,550
She's yelling out and you and you.

189
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,820
And then when she sees your act and then,

190
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:57,990
uh,

191
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,340
like she sees an old recording
and she sees that bitch.

192
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,080
Fuck you.

193
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,960
She didn't even tell me you
wouldn't make it an asshole.

194
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,450
Fucking selfish.

195
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,460
Bz Brian,

196
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,710
are you doing it like
during the wedding vows?

197
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,480
And she says,

198
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,720
and you and you go,

199
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,020
all right,

200
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,310
I got to tell you that,

201
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:18,871
you know,

202
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,630
when he hosted the espys in 2001,

203
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,790
Oj Simpson was just forced to give his
heisman trophy back to Fred Goldman

204
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,560
because Oj lost the civil suit,

205
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,990
so he had to give money
reparations back there.

206
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,250
Fred Goldman and Nicole.

207
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,391
So he didn't have any money,

208
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:36,030
so we should take my heisman
trophy for whatever that's worth.

209
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,700
So Fred Goldberg takes
it and now he owns it.

210
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,290
So the next week or the me enormous
hosts espys Charles Woodson,

211
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,760
the guy who won the heisman trophy,

212
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,950
the first defensive guy ever
sitting in the front row.

213
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,091
First joke,

214
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:48,781
norm tells.

215
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,130
He looks in the front row and he says,

216
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:50,731
Hey,

217
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:51,600
Charles Woodson,

218
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,700
and you won the heisman trophy.

219
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:57,090
No one can ever take that away
from your first defensive guy,

220
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,310
win the heisman trophy.

221
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:59,750
No one can ever take that away from him.

222
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,800
And everybody applauds.

223
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:04,220
It's like a real nice thing and
it settles down and one goes,

224
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,590
no one can ever take
that heisman trophy away.

225
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,000
And then he pauses and said,

226
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,490
unless of course you kill
your wife and a waiter

227
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,780
at bomb hit it really well.

228
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:18,614
It was a.

229
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,520
yeah,

230
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,190
it was a radio studio
and it was Ken Griffey.

231
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:23,024
Jr was,

232
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,100
oh my God.

233
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,660
Oh my God,

234
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,600
what did they expect as normal?

235
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,400
Fucking Mcdonald.

236
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,140
Maybe not task,

237
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,920
but actually it makes
me love him even more.

238
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,790
Norm and I talked.

239
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,100
We sat next to each other
randomly on an airplane,

240
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,510
talked the whole way back,

241
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,560
just shot the shit,

242
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,520
talking about all kinds of stuff.

243
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,091
I was like,

244
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:41,391
yeah,

245
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,860
I quit smoking while ago.

246
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,370
Just done with it and for
whatever reason the plane lands.

247
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,880
And he goes,

248
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,151
man,

249
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,200
I just want a cigarette.

250
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,140
And he just walks in this door that
you hadn't smoked in like x amount of

251
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:51,650
months.

252
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,620
But just decided to talking
about it on the airplane,

253
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,910
how he quit smoking,

254
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,990
that he just wanted another cigarette.

255
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,710
He went outside and he's just smoking.

256
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,161
I go,

257
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:01,994
what happened?

258
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,281
I go,

259
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:03,051
I thought you quit smoking.

260
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:03,241
He goes,

261
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:05,690
I did until just now.

262
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,160
I just wanted a cigarette.

263
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,661
The movie,

264
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,220
me and him,

265
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,750
I did a buddy comedy with
him and it got bad reviews,

266
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,330
so the reviewer in my hometown paper said,

267
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,340
Artie Lange has all the charm of a date,

268
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,030
rapists,

269
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,400
fruit,

270
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,233
true line.

271
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,420
So norm looks at it and he
calls me up and he goes,

272
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
hey man,

273
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:22,990
that's fucking great.

274
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,040
A date.

275
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,020
Rapists has to have way more
charm than a regular rapish.

276
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,680
Oh God bless.

277
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,930
That made me feel better.
