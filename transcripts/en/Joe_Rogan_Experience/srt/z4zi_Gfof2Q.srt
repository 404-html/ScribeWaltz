1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,590
The general good experience
in a manner dangerous,

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:09,300
and that's why we have a system called
the patriarchy took women might cost as a

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:13,380
bit about a great system to protect women
from the ages of man called Patriarchy

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,214
and we threw it.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,690
We throw it away because the colleges.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,850
I think it's important to talk about
Patriarchy because I feel that young 20

7
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:25,550
year old women need their own Illuminati
to talk about their failures on what's

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,300
going on.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,781
It's yeah,

10
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:28,440
it's like it's Illuminati for girls.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,790
Conspiracy theory.

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,170
Patriarchy can ask for the set definition.

13
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:34,851
There isn't one.

14
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:35,670
Is that suspicious?

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,451
Same with racist.

16
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,650
There is one in the dictionary,

17
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:38,940
but that's not the accepted one.

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,460
Ask just any online feminist.

19
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,160
What does it mean?

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,730
There's no.

21
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:41,941
Well,

22
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,590
you can be wherever you can be like it's.

23
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,010
It's.

24
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,980
It means you're my ex boyfriend named
Gary Click of mean girls is that

25
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,440
patriarchy are in a position of power.

26
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,700
That's the patriarchy,

27
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,290
but men have been in the workplace for
hundreds of years more than women is that

28
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,690
there's a real problem with the
idea that it should be caught up.

29
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,660
But what about when you hear
this shit where somebody goes,

30
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,620
when people wonder where all the female
comedians know who said that do to

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,451
people talking about it?

32
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:06,790
When?

33
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,150
When Louie got shellacked
by that fucked up article,

34
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,610
people were saying that shit about,

35
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,240
you know what,

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
how come is that an equal number
of female comedians to males?

37
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,061
Well,

38
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,100
because women are treated
better in our society.

39
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:17,550
Yeah.

40
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,100
If there's an amount of female comedians,

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,581
you know,

42
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,300
women are being abused way more than ever
because you don't get in this job from

43
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,134
a happy.

44
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,550
This job isn't about support.

45
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,170
It's you get last
because you're fucked up.

46
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,650
So I hope there's not a lot of women in
it that would mean they're being raped

47
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,484
more.

48
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,151
There's that.

49
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:37,260
But it is also just from a female
perspective of a chick's funny.

50
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,870
It's harder because
something happened to her.

51
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,561
They can't,

52
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,270
but they can't talk about
certain things like,

53
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:42,990
no,

54
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,990
no man wants to see a woman on stage
telling politic stories or politic jokes.

55
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,333
If it's funny,

56
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,720
I say that,

57
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:52,830
but it did create a lot of the daily show.

58
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,693
Maybe you're right,

59
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,390
maybe you.

60
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,010
But most people in the audience,

61
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,580
for the woman who started out harder,

62
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,600
I won't rule out anything if I'll take.

63
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,680
I won't say any premise
has hackey just punchline.

64
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,100
So if your premise is
airline fucking peanuts,

65
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:05,550
that's fine.

66
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,540
Tell me what your punchline is.

67
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,860
Maybe a punchline justifies it.

68
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,650
I don't,

69
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:08,960
I don't,

70
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,650
I won't rule out any premise
on the premises or hacky,

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,060
but people probably don't want to hear it.

72
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:15,300
But who,

73
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,080
you know,

74
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,381
it's like,

75
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:16,620
look,

76
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,980
if you can get people to listen to some
shit that they basically don't want to

77
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:20,790
hear.

78
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,150
Like,

79
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,983
oh great,

80
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,800
this is for my use to do
the black rooms I started.

81
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,400
So I totally agree with you.

82
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,610
I'm totally in agreement with you.

83
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,860
We're not talking about
drinking caveman coffee.

84
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,940
We're not talking to you.

85
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,920
I feel wired is from that 270 milligrams.

86
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,571
How many did you have?

87
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:36,240
Like Gut.

88
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
Well I just started sipping wine,

89
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,041
but I'm like,

90
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,330
I feel like I get one that's empty.

91
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:42,390
Did you black out and suck
down and just I just drank one.

92
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,530
What the fuck is this?

93
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,840
Nobody cares about those.

94
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,570
You like the use of like fungal.

95
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,830
It's not used that often.

96
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,490
It is in Jersey.

97
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,700
Go to the east coast.

98
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,660
Go to where those old school
guineas landed on boats,

99
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,710
fucked each other on the rocks and made
a bunch of them and they all stayed

100
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,830
there about fungal.

101
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,530
What's the.

102
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,300
What's the Italian Horn like?

103
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:07,900
If you're Italian,

104
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,100
you've attended one of those

105
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,250
shows.

106
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,083
You're a moron.

107
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,241
I don't know.

108
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,290
I don't know where it came from.

109
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,580
We all had them in high school though,

110
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,970
like if you had a gold chain with a horn,

111
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,804
like wow,

112
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,100
look at stylish.

113
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,620
Did Not know that thing existed.

114
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,770
It's called the scene that sperm before,

115
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,480
but that's probably what it is.

116
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,350
Cold sperm.

117
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,840
Little Horn or horn lit.

118
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,560
Sometimes abbreviated tacoma.

119
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,610
Isn't Italian amulet or talisman
worn to protect against the evil eye

120
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,250
or Mala Chico and bad luck in general
and historically to promote fertility and

121
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,820
virility.

122
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,550
That's the last thing we need is promote
fertility and kids in high school

123
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:52,300
wearing those things.

124
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,350
So it is a sperm.

125
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,513
Yeah,

126
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,590
Neapolitan.

127
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,423
It's called.

128
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,190
Can we Cielo or variance thereof.

129
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,520
We talked by sperm.

130
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,621
That's crazy.

131
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:05,940
It is.

132
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,600
Just golden judges on
your chest essentially.

133
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,060
Right?

134
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,000
The golden ges were
protected from the evil one.

135
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,320
You gave me the blog,

136
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,530
but I still got my not off.

137
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,270
My Dad gave this to me.

138
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,830
They'll fucking evil eye over here.

139
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,721
Yeah.

140
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:29,010
What you're wearing it right where
a pearl necklace with land too.

141
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,700
Yeah,

142
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,790
it's foul.

143
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,800
Foul little amulet.

144
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,510
Imagine they talk those kids into wearing
golden ges around their neck and all

145
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,380
these years they thought,

146
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:38,830
hey,

147
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,700
that fucking evil.

148
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,700
I could suck my Dick.

149
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:41,500
How about that?

150
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,333
Hey,

151
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,530
I'm going to go out.

152
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:46,780
I got a good amount of gold chains.

153
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,830
I got a good solid fucking horn here.

154
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,480
Look at that.

155
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,930
Can't Catholic priest
probably give them to me.

156
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:53,830
It looks like.

157
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,240
Come.

158
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,760
Yeah,

159
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,810
it doesn't even look like a horn.

160
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,950
What kind of fucking Horn is that?

161
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,040
Where it's round on top.

162
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:58,430
Like a,

163
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,430
like a sperm head towards aren't round
at the top and it's rounded at the top.

164
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,270
It looks like it's swimming
up stream to the guys.

165
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:07,750
Mass is going into your mouth.

166
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,690
If you go back,

167
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,940
go back to those pictures
of different ones.

168
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:16,000
Is there anyone that has a flat
top that looks like a fucking horn?

169
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,811
No.

170
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:18,430
All of them are rounded at the top.

171
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,300
Like ges,

172
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,600
those Italian horns.

173
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,640
They're all rounded at the top.

174
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,270
Like just.

175
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,320
This is insane.

176
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,930
I don't see any of them that.

177
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,330
Look,

178
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,350
that's not an Italian horn at six.

179
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,810
That's the wrong one.

180
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,130
That's got some like Gucci Shit.

181
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,993
Like someone,

182
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
some designer got ahold of it.

183
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,511
The new take on deal.

184
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:40,330
Italian horn.

185
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,320
It's all the rage.

186
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,570
Everyone wears it.

187
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,280
Everyone wears it.

188
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,161
Yes.

189
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:46,240
I've got three on.

190
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,120
I can't believe people wear that shit.

191
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,073
They do.

192
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,370
They can't help themselves.

193
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,660
They grow up in those communities.

194
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,494
I did it too.

195
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,423
I wore.

196
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,170
You're around a bunch of
east coast Italian people.

197
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,011
They're all wearing it.

198
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:01,880
You're all wearing it.

199
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,051
It's like God,

200
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,700
you got yet Tahlia and hon

201
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,360
and when I.

202
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,160
When I saw the guy that had it on,

203
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,611
he took.

204
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:09,850
I got.

205
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,001
Yeah.

206
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,030
I got and then kissed,

207
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,810
kissed the ges.

208
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,560
It's just my good luck.

209
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,643
God bless you.

210
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,360
God bless him.

211
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,240
What st be St Peter.

212
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,093
Right,

213
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,900
right.

214
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,733
I mean it's godly.

215
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,190
Which ones attached to it.

216
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,031
That's like weird,

217
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:31,540
like there's always affiliations like
certain saints are attached to certain,

218
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,033
you know,

219
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,960
fucking ridiculous.

220
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,603
Wow.

221
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,000
This,

222
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,833
what year was this?

223
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,640
Dear God,

224
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,031
I don't remember.

225
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,860
I've been so much on whatever.

226
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,650
You're great for guys.

227
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,950
Been hitting the head as many as you.

228
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:45,480
Well,

229
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I never had a concussion.

230
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,291
I will say that.

231
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:47,360
Well,

232
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,810
you must have never had a concussion.

233
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
But what is a concussion?

234
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,480
Concussion is like where they check.

235
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:54,700
Your pupils are not correctly.

236
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,623
None of it.

237
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,170
None of them.

238
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,360
No concussions at all.

239
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,510
All that hard sparring.

240
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,160
Nope.

241
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,530
Never.

242
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,640
I find that hard to believe this.

243
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,620
He never got hit with a shot
that I didn't see coming.

244
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,200
And I think that's the difference.

245
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:04,960
Nope.

246
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,590
Nope.

247
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,590
Besides one time in a huge fight where
a dude hit me in the side of the head

248
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:11,140
with a brick and I saw it last
second night at least rolled with it.

249
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,850
And that didn't give you a concussion?

250
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,230
He,

251
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:13,870
I,

252
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,291
he,

253
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,070
uh,

254
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,850
it was a huge.

255
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,950
It was hip hop night at the
nightclub I was bouncing at.

256
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,220
Oh,

257
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,053
sounds like fun.

258
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,160
And and the Illinois gang and the
Iowa gangbangers started going at it.

259
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,410
I tried breaking it up
and they all attacked me,

260
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,890
right?

261
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,580
Jesus.

262
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,900
So that's when I.

263
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,261
Everybody was wearing,

264
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:29,981
it was wintertime,

265
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,070
so I was choking people.

266
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,770
A guy got me in a headlock and I was
grabbing people by the lapels and I'd hit

267
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:37,480
my head in between his head and his
head and I'd choke him unconscious.

268
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:38,380
I'd find a new coat.

269
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,130
And I was working my way backwards out
the front door and finally snuck out of

270
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:42,701
the headlock,

271
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:43,600
put him in a rear choke,

272
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:44,740
went backwards out the door.

273
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,821
He went limp.

274
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:46,654
I dropped him.

275
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,400
And then as I turned to
get out into the street,

276
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,830
because there was cops
everywhere at that point,

277
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:51,664
there's dogs.

278
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,950
It's a snow storm.

279
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,921
Last second,

280
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,790
I see this coming at the side of my head.

281
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,200
Then I duck and it bounces off
my head and this dude goes,

282
00:07:59,201 --> 00:07:59,860
yeah,

283
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,760
like I was going to go down and I turned
and I looked at him and rifle them with

284
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,030
the right hand and knocked him out.

285
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,260
And then the next thing you know,

286
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:07,030
there's just dogs diving into the crowd.

287
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,460
It was a good one.

288
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,293
And that was a fun one.

289
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,000
Dogs,

290
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,833
that's not good.

291
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,673
No.

292
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,660
Dogs Work Day work.

293
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,890
They work real well.

294
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,590
It's not good because they don't
know who the fuck they're biting.

295
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,431
They might bite you.

296
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,730
They might buy the bad guys.

297
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,440
I mean,

298
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,990
who the fuck dogs don't
know who the bouncer is.

299
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,340
Clear route real quick.

300
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,851
Fuck yeah,

301
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:25,400
they do.

302
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,170
Yeah.

303
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,190
After you've done it and you have.

304
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,270
You've done the workout and stuff.

305
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,100
Chilling.

306
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,650
Yeah.

307
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,010
You just feel loose and he feel amazing.

308
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,013
He's brilliant.

309
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,100
Every Wednesday morning
and I don't want to go.

310
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,420
I'll fucking tell you the truth.

311
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:38,111
I'm driving down.

312
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:39,310
That's an hour away from me.

313
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,201
I'm thinking,

314
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,034
fuck this.

315
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,540
And then I get there and it's just.

316
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,311
It's just a very,

317
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:44,861
very special.

318
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:45,631
It's illegal.

319
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:46,650
Is Weed in England.

320
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,861
I'm not into it.

321
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,130
Me,

322
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,963
listen bro.

323
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,940
Take two solid hits and
then go to yoga class.

324
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,300
Solid hits.

325
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,133
I'm behind in,

326
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,680
back in myself where I'm telling
you it's not for the American.

327
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,970
We'll get ahold of some of this.

328
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:04,890
California orbit serious who
hits and then go to a yoga class.

329
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,420
It's like you're on a journey.

330
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,140
You're like,

331
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,100
you get out of their hour and a half late.

332
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:11,310
It's perfect because an hour
and a half into the sweating,

333
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,030
the pots worn off and you like to come
back down and put in the middle of it.

334
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,730
You feel like the world's going to end
any second now in the middle of the

335
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:18,091
class,

336
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,830
like there's no way
this can be sustainable.

337
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,840
There's no way I'm not going to survive.

338
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,650
Did the whole way you think about
everything that's going on and get on with

339
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:26,780
Joel will like a house on fire.

340
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:27,940
That's been mom,

341
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,773
my dad,

342
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,651
not me.

343
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:31,170
I can't do it.

344
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,370
I don't agree with me.

345
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,360
I love it for Yoga,

346
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:33,810
swollen,

347
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,471
my favorite things.

348
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,420
Ever take two hits and go to yoga class.

349
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,381
When you stone,

350
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:39,060
you can't not be on stone quick.

351
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,540
He just like,

352
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,040
Oh shit.

353
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,300
Right?

354
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,133
If it's well,

355
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,560
no,

356
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,391
there's no wearing off.

357
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:45,050
Quick Caffeine helps a little bit coffee.

358
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,840
Remember Jordan,

359
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,300
give me a drop economy so I'll be fine.

360
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,160
I like melody and we saw for for about
six hours and I couldn't move and I'm

361
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,730
thinking I'm dead exam,

362
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,310
I'm donating time.

363
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,140
Last time I was here hired someone,

364
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,460
I add some cannabis oil and I was sat
there watching TV and then I was like,

365
00:09:59,461 --> 00:09:59,781
fuck,

366
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:00,810
you know those mine

367
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,300
got the remote control from the TV and
this guy was gotten a little and it

368
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,750
turned him over and I went,

369
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,750
huh me fucking self.

370
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:10,760
And then I knew for no,

371
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,370
it's not for you.
