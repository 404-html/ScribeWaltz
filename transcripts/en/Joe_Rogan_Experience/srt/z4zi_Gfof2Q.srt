1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,440
The joe rogan experience or was it a
manner dangerous and that's why we have a

2
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:08,100
system called the
Patriarchy took tact women.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,890
Mike Michael Cost has a bit about a
great system to protect women from the

4
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,990
dangers of men called
Patriarchy and we threw it.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,660
We throw it away because the colleges,

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,860
I think it's important to talk about
patriarchy because I feel that young 20

7
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:23,050
year old women need their
own Illuminati to talk about,

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,410
you know?

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,290
totally.

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,050
In their failures on what's going on.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,591
It's,

13
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:26,791
yeah,

14
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,450
it's like it's Illuminati for girls.

15
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:30,820
Finally telling conspiracy theory,

16
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,870
patriarchy,

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,180
ask for the set definition.

18
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:34,841
There isn't one.

19
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:35,650
Is that as suspicious?

20
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,500
The same with racism.

21
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,660
There is one in the dictionary,

22
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:38,920
but I that's not the except to one.

23
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,450
Ask just any on my feminist.

24
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:41,170
What does it mean?

25
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,740
There's no,

26
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:41,921
well,

27
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,360
it can be whatever you want to be like.

28
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,591
It's,

29
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:43,990
it's,

30
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,990
it means you're my ex boyfriend named
Jerry Click of mean girls is that

31
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:49,420
patriarchy are in a position of power,

32
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:49,781
right?

33
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:50,710
That's the patriarchy.

34
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,300
But men have been in the workplace for
hundreds of years more than women is that

35
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,150
there's a real problem.

36
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,050
The idea,

37
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,700
the columns on it should be caught up.

38
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,670
But what about when you hear
this shit where somebody goes,

39
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,130
when people wonder where
all the female comedians?

40
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:03,640
I like,

41
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:03,911
no.

42
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:04,360
Uh,

43
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,650
he said that dude there,

44
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,700
people talking about it when it,

45
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,120
when Louie got shellacked by that fucked
up article where people were saying

46
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:11,620
that shit about,

47
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:11,951
you know,

48
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:12,250
what,

49
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,620
how come there's not an equal
number of female comedians to males?

50
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,041
Well,

51
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,140
because women are treated
better in our society.

52
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:17,530
Yeah.

53
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,480
If there's enough damage,

54
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,080
amount of female Comedians,

55
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,591
you know,

56
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,310
women are being abused way more than ever
because you don't get in his job from

57
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:25,144
a happy,

58
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,530
his job isn't about support.

59
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,150
It's you get last cause you fucked up.

60
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,660
So I hope there's not a lot of women in
it that would mean they're being raped.

61
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,160
More does that.

62
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,000
But it is also,

63
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,400
it's just from a female perspective,

64
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,270
if a chick's funny,

65
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,880
it's harder because
something happened to her.

66
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,571
They can't,

67
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:42,280
but they can't talk about
certain things like,

68
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:43,000
no,

69
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
no man wants to see a woman on stage
town politics stories or politic jokes.

70
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,700
If it's funny you say that,

71
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,840
but they did create a
lot of the daily show.

72
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:53,674
Maybe you're right,

73
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,370
maybe you,

74
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,250
but most people in the audience
for the woman who harder,

75
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,550
I won't rule out anything if I'll take,

76
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,070
I won't say any premises hacky,

77
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,801
just punch lines.

78
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:05,080
So if your premise is
airline fucking peanuts,

79
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:05,561
that's fine.

80
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:06,550
Tell me what your punchline is.

81
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,870
Maybe your punchline justifies it,

82
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,270
right?

83
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,590
I don't,

84
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:08,920
I don't,

85
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,570
I won't rule out any premise.

86
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,650
Premise is or hacky,

87
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,040
but people probably don't want to hear it,

88
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:15,874
but who you know,

89
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,391
it's like,

90
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:16,601
look,

91
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:19,990
if you can get people to listen to some
shit that they basically don't want to

92
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:20,800
hear,

93
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,160
like,

94
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,730
oh great,

95
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,421
like this is from,

96
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:23,780
I used to do the black
rooms when I started out.

97
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,270
I totally agree with you.

98
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:25,480
Yeah,

99
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,590
I'm totally in agreement with you.

100
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:27,131
We're not talking.

101
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:27,970
What are you drinking?

102
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,863
Caveman coffee.

103
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,943
We're not talking to you.

104
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,900
I feel wired is wicked wire
from that 270 milligrams.

105
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,890
How many did you might go?

106
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,520
Well,

107
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,570
I just started sipping wine,

108
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:38,081
but I'm like,

109
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,340
I feel like I can one that's empty.

110
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:41,570
Did you black out and
suck that one Justin?

111
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,401
I just drank one.

112
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:43,510
What the fuck is this?

113
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,670
Okay.

114
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,840
Nobody cares about those.

115
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,540
You like the use of like fungal.

116
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,950
Okay.

117
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,490
It's not used that often
that it is in Jersey.

118
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,650
Okay.

119
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,700
Go to the east coast.

120
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,660
Go to where those old school
guineas landed on boats,

121
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,740
fucked each other on the rocks and made
a bunch of them and they all stayed

122
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:04,110
there about phone.

123
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:04,944
Google.

124
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,530
What's the,

125
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,300
what's the Italian Horn like?

126
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:07,841
If you're Italian,

127
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,100
you always have had one of those

128
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,220
pig shows.

129
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,054
You're a moron.

130
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,241
I don't know.

131
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,290
I don't know where it came from.

132
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,580
We all had them in high school though.

133
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,970
It was like if you had a
gold chain with a horn,

134
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,804
like wow,

135
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,100
look at stylish,

136
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,620
did not know that thing existed.

137
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,640
It's called the comma.

138
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,770
Cellos seen that sperm before,

139
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,480
but that's probably what it is.

140
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,343
Cold sperm,

141
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,530
little Horne or Horne let
sometimes abbreviated to Como.

142
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,640
Isn't Italian amulet or talisman
worn to protect against the evil eye

143
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,230
or Mala Ciccio and bad luck in general
and historically to promote fertility and

144
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,814
virility.

145
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,550
That's the last thing we need to promote
fertility and kids in high school

146
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:52,270
wearing those things.

147
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,350
So it is a sperm?

148
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,513
Yeah,

149
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,720
Neapolitan.

150
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,190
It's called Kumu Cielo
or variance thereof.

151
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,871
What you're talking about?

152
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:03,704
My sperm.

153
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,621
That's crazy.

154
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,311
It is just,

155
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,100
it's just between your and
your golden Jizz on your chest,

156
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,601
essentially.

157
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,050
Right?

158
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,030
The Golden Tj's or protect
you from the evil eye.

159
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,290
You gave me the evil eye,

160
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,690
but I still got my not off.

161
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,950
Oh,

162
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,270
dad gave this to me.

163
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,840
The fucking evil eye over here.

164
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,721
Yeah.

165
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:29,110
What you're wearing it right where
a pearl necklace with Lynn too.

166
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:29,950
Yeah,

167
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,790
it's foul.

168
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
Foul little amulet.

169
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,510
Imagine they talk those kids into wearing
golden just around the neck and all

170
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,380
these years they thought,

171
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:38,860
hey,

172
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,651
that fucking evil.

173
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:41,260
I could suck my dick about that.

174
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm going to go out.

175
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,750
I got a good amount of gold chains.

176
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,171
I got up.

177
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,840
Good solid fucking horn hand.

178
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,460
Look at that.

179
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:49,960
Can't,

180
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,160
Catholic priests probably give
them to me it looks like calm.

181
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,760
Yeah.

182
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,810
It doesn't even look like a horn.

183
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,950
What kind of fucking Horn is that?

184
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,290
Where it's round on the top like a,

185
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,560
like a sperm head.

186
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,780
Horns aren't rounded at the top.

187
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,100
It's all rounded.

188
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,581
The top.

189
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,310
It looks like it's swimming
up stream to the guys.

190
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,750
Mass is going into your mouth.

191
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,720
If you go back,

192
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,940
go back to those pictures
of different ones.

193
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:16,000
Is there anyone that has a flat
top that looks like a fucking horn?

194
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,811
No.

195
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:18,430
All of them are rounded at the top.

196
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,300
Like Jizz.

197
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,600
Those Italian horns,

198
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,640
they're all rounded at the top.

199
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,271
Like just,

200
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,320
this is insane.

201
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,110
I don't see any of them that look,

202
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:29,360
I go,

203
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
that's not an Italian horn
at six that's the wrong one.

204
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,610
That's some,

205
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,130
that's some like Gucci Shit.

206
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,993
Like someone,

207
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,500
some designer got ahold of
it and a new take on deal.

208
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,331
Italian horn.

209
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,330
It's all the rage everyone wears.

210
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,050
Everyone was,

211
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,160
yes,

212
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,270
I've got three on.

213
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,120
I can't believe people wear that shit.

214
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,073
They do.

215
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,370
They can't help themselves.

216
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,660
They grew up in those communities.

217
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,494
I did it too.

218
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,440
I wore one.

219
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,460
You're around a bunch of,

220
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:58,701
uh,

221
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,170
east coast Italian people.

222
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,011
They're all wearing it.

223
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:01,880
You're all wearing it.

224
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:02,880
It's like,

225
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,031
God,

226
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,700
you got yet Italian horn.

227
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,330
And when I say,

228
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,160
when I saw the guy that had it on,

229
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:09,611
he took,

230
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:09,830
I got,

231
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,971
yeah,

232
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,230
I got in and kissed it.

233
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,000
He kissed the ges.

234
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,580
It's just my good luck,

235
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:16,414
judge.

236
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,663
God bless you.

237
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,331
God bless you.

238
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:22,240
What saint who should be Saint Peter,

239
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:23,074
right?

240
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,213
Yeah.

241
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:24,910
Right.

242
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,091
I mean,

243
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:27,190
it's gotta be which ones attached to it.

244
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,001
That's like weird.

245
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:29,260
Like there's always affiliations,

246
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,570
like certain saints are
attached to certain,

247
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,003
you know,

248
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,960
the fucking ridiculous.

249
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,603
Wow.

250
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:36,971
This,

251
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:37,804
what year was this,

252
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,640
Dear God,

253
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,060
I don't remember.

254
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,780
I've been having so
much on it or whatever.

255
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,130
Yeah,

256
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,320
no,

257
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,180
you're great.

258
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:44,950
For a guy who's been hit
in the head as many as you,

259
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,460
well,

260
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,480
I never had a concussion.

261
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,790
I will say that we must
have never had a concussion.

262
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,150
Really?

263
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,750
Nope.

264
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,740
But what is a concussion?

265
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,910
Concussion is like,

266
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,001
well,

267
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,210
they check your pupils.

268
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,790
They're not dialing correctly.

269
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,171
None of them.

270
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,360
No concussions and all,

271
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,510
all that hard sparring.

272
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,200
Nope.

273
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,500
Never.

274
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,170
I find that hard to believe that he never
got hit with a shot that they didn't

275
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,004
see coming.

276
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,240
And I think that's the difference.

277
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:04,960
Nope.

278
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,290
Nope.

279
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:05,590
Wow.

280
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,620
Besides one time in a huge fight where
a dude hit me in the side of the head

281
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:10,140
with a brick and I saw it last second,

282
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,140
I at least rolled with it.

283
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,880
And that didn't give you a concussion?

284
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,620
He,

285
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:13,990
I,

286
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,823
he uh,

287
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,873
it was a huge bro.

288
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,950
It was hip hop night at the
nightclub I was bouncing at.

289
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,221
Oh,

290
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,054
sounds like fun.

291
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,953
And,

292
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,873
and,

293
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,370
and the Illinois gangbangers and the Iowa
gangbangers started going at it and I

294
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:26,410
tried breaking it up and
they all attacked me,

295
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:26,861
right.

296
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:27,580
Jesus.

297
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,480
So that's when I,

298
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,261
everybody was wearing,

299
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:29,980
it was wintertime.

300
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,120
So I was choking people.

301
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:34,610
A guy got me in a headlock and I was
grabbing people by their coat lapels and I

302
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:37,480
hit my head in between his head and
his head and I'd choke him unconscious.

303
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,320
I'd find a new coat and I was working
my way backwards out the front door and

304
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:42,700
finally snuck out of the headlock,

305
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:43,600
put him in a rear choke,

306
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:44,710
went backwards off the door.

307
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,820
He went limp.

308
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,660
I dropped him.

309
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,420
And then as I turned to
get out into the street,

310
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:50,830
cause there was cops
everywhere at that point.

311
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:51,551
There's dogs,

312
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:51,840
there's,

313
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,870
it's a snow storm.

314
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,921
Last second,

315
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,470
I see this coming at the side
of my head and I duck in,

316
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:59,200
it bounces off my head and this dude goes,

317
00:07:59,201 --> 00:07:59,861
yeah,

318
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:02,780
like I was going to go down and I turned
and I looked at him and rifled and with

319
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,060
the right hand and knocked him out.

320
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,030
And then the next thing you know
there's just dogs diving into the crowd.

321
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,470
It was a good one.

322
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,280
And that was a fun one.

323
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,000
Dogs,

324
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
that's not good.

325
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,250
No.

326
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,490
Yeah,

327
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,660
the dogs work day work.

328
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,890
They work real well.

329
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,620
It's not good because they don't
know who the fuck they're biting.

330
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:18,431
They might bite you.

331
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,750
They might bite the bad guys.

332
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:20,531
I mean,

333
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,990
who the fuck dogs don't
know who the bouncer is?

334
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,340
Clear crowd out real quick.

335
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,701
Fuck.

336
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:24,851
Yeah,

337
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:25,390
they do.

338
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,140
Yeah.

339
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,260
After you've donate and you have
to eat on the workout and stuff.

340
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,200
The children,

341
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:29,740
yeah.

342
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,030
You just feel loose and he feel amazing.

343
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,100
He's brilliant every Wednesday
morning and I don't want to go,

344
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,420
I'll fucking tell you the truth.

345
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:39,310
I'm driving down that
so now it away from me.

346
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,201
I'm thinking,

347
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,034
fuck this,

348
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,540
and then I get there and it's just,

349
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,311
it's just a very,

350
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:46,650
very special with illegal
is weed and England.

351
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,861
I'm not into it.

352
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,100
Me,

353
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,933
listen bro,

354
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,140
take two solid hits and
then go to yoga clinic.

355
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,670
It's all solid hits up behind in Rebecca
myself or I'm telling you it's not

356
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:57,690
familiar to see American.

357
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,790
We get ahold of some of
this California Shit.

358
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,470
Yeah.

359
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,890
Orbit serious two hits and
then go to a yoga class.

360
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,390
It's like you're on a journey.

361
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,141
You're like,

362
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,120
you get out of their hour and a half late,

363
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:11,340
it's perfect cause an hour
and a half into the sweating,

364
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,940
the pots worn off and you'll like you
come back down and put in the middle of

365
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:15,031
it.

366
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,730
You feel like the world's going to end
any second now in the middle of the

367
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:18,091
class,

368
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,860
like there's no way
this can be sustainable.

369
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,960
There's no way I'm not going to survive.

370
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,891
Did the whole way.

371
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,240
You just think about everything
that's going on in Tracy.

372
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:25,831
Get on with Joe.

373
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,790
We're like a house on fire.

374
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,190
Yeah,

375
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,320
that's been my dad

376
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,750
had not me.

377
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:31,330
I can't do it.

378
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,340
I don't agree with me.

379
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:33,360
I love it for Yoga.

380
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:33,810
Small.

381
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,430
My favorite things ever take
two hits and go to yoga class.

382
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,350
I think it's when you stone,

383
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,060
you can't not be on stone quick.

384
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,541
He just like,

385
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,374
Oh shit.

386
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,550
No,

387
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,780
there's no wearing off quick.

388
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,380
Yeah,

389
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,550
caffeine helps a little bit.

390
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,800
I remember Jordan give
me a drop of cannabis.

391
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,311
I'll be fine.

392
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,061
I like Mel it into,

393
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:51,360
we saw for for about six hours and I
couldn't move and I'm thinking I'm dead.

394
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,871
I'm Sam,

395
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,330
I'm doing it.

396
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,163
Yeah.

397
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,330
Last time I was here high at some and
I add some cannabis oil and I was sat

398
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,460
there watching TV and then I was like,

399
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,090
fucking hell,

400
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,923
that was mine.

401
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,180
And then you got the remote control from
the TV and this guy was gotten a low

402
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,750
and it turned him over and I went,

403
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,683
Huh.

404
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,750
To me fucking self.

405
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:10,770
And then I knew for no,

406
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:11,420
it's not for you.

407
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,253
This

408
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,340
okay.
