1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,270
Holy fucking Shit,
we're doing it again,

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:09,060
folks.
Monday 2:30

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,350
PM,
2:37.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,750
Exactly.
Los Angeles high aids,

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,930
higher aids content,
and the amt.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,940
Brian has every known venereal disease 
fighting it out for dominance inside of 

7
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:23,700
his soul right now,
but I'm on zinc and magnesium.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,370
He's taken Alpha brain that's keeping 
them together.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,520
What would you recommend in on its 
category or different things for me

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,010
before you went?
I would say take a shitload of that.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,130
Take a lot of coconut oil.
Coconut oil is shown to have 

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,570
antibacterial and antimicrobial pro 
qualities to it,

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,730
so you could take coconut oil,
rub it on your Dick,

14
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:49,020
and conceivably it protect you from a 
few very unambitious,

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,390
stds,
Lazy Std.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,170
Not like aggressive Ebola type super 
aids.

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,710
Yeah,
it ain't going to fight that out,

18
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:01,540
but it might kick the shit out of 
chlamydia.

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,630
You know what I'm saying?
I've been running rubbing a killer bee 

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,390
honey on some of the sores.
That's good.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,580
That's a good move.
We pull and sticky now.

22
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:10,320
That's great.
Yeah,

23
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,220
that's awesome.
Dot Com.

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,330
This is not bullshit.
We sell killer bee honey.

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,290
We also offer no evidence.
That's even better than regular honey.

26
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,770
We don't give a fuck.
The fact that we can sell the honey from

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,370
those gangster bees,
we stole it from them.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,430
That's human dominance.
That's one for teen people.

29
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,700
I'll take that killer bee honey and you 
can go fuck yourself.

30
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:35,701
Bees.
We win and they are not very good on 

31
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,850
these sores though.
Like for real?

32
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,770
Not Good.
We'll just probably go to a doctor.

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,090
You probably have eight now.

34
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,370
You don't want to go to a doctor because
you don't want to know that you have 

35
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:45,370
your patient zero.
Do you get ingrown hairs a lot though?

36
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,430
You get ingrown hairs because I'm a 
hairy guy so I get is a lot.

37
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,260
Yeah,
I mean on your package now.

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,280
My packets.
But like around that area right on your 

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,280
face.
Like I get them once in a while.

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,980
My face like my heavier in Shaden 
shavings.

41
00:01:56,981 --> 00:02:00,490
You don't look like you shave a lot man.
He's usually the cause of ingrown hairs.

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,540
Yeah.
Messing around with your hair when you 

43
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:05,540
shave your right?
Yeah.

44
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,250
Especially if you use a blade.
That's the thing about

45
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,510
shaving it down.
The stubble you don't run the risk of 

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,540
the,
the hair's getting stuck under the skin 

47
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,000
because that's what happens.
It's an ingrown like grows in a fucked 

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,181
up way and then pops out like a Zit.
But if you leave stubble that doesn't 

49
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:20,181
happen.

50
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,320
Do you shave like from your butthole to 
your balls like once every six months,

51
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:24,550
year,
three months,

52
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,090
like you know,
like that,

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,120
the whole taint area or do you do it?
Don't

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,120
do a full groom.
I do do the balls and the front package 

55
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,220
and not usually like down to the bone 
but this time I did because I fucked up 

56
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:42,470
but it just cut it too low and it looks 
stupid and I was looking at the hedges.

57
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:43,460
I was like,
this is a wrap.

58
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:46,220
I got to wrap this one up and I just 
fucking buzz the whole thing.

59
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,430
So for the next couple of weeks I'm 
going to look like a 12 year old.

60
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,600
But you know what I'm chicks dig that.
I'm checking.

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,250
Yeah.
At this point it doesn't matter.

62
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,360
You know who gives a fuck,
shave it off,

63
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:03,000
keep it,
just don't cut any patterns in it.

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,870
And I would say,
don't go with a razor.

65
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,720
That's where you're getting the

66
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,250
Gillette sensor to that.
Yeah,

67
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,480
you get sold

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,800
blow,
you know,

69
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:17,801
you're like exfoliating.
They say that's also one of the reasons 

70
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,771
why men don't get those funky lines in 
their face and near their mouth as much 

71
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:22,970
as women do because of the shaving.
Exfoliates the skin.

72
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:25,760
It constantly creates a new level layer 
of skin.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,220
Whereas women don't get that opportunity
to shave.

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,140
So they get creepy old lady face.

75
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,300
Well,
what's getting big now?

76
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,580
You see all the stores that you like the
men's shaving,

77
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,190
like in the twenties where they sit you 
down straight razor.

78
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,410
I've never done it.
I've had friends,

79
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,740
I've had friends that told me it's 
awesome that he had a great experience.

80
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,410
I've never done it.
Car,

81
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,450
you just escaped death.
Now it's like jumping off a fucking 

82
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:47,450
building.
Make It.

83
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,480
You make it.
It feels great.

84
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,080
It's got a knife right next to your 
throat.

85
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,940
If you how?
How quick can you fight them off?

86
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,110
You're dead.
You're a dead man.

87
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,520
He's going to cut your throat.
You're fucked.

88
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,690
You know you're not going to be able to 
fight that guy.

89
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:57,730
Oh God.
Father type shit.

90
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,070
Fuck.
He's got Ya.

91
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,690
It's not.
I'm not into that.

92
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,250
What can I avoid that?
Yeah,

93
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,560
I can write with one of those things.

94
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,960
Okay.
I'll take that thing over.

95
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,860
Jesus.
Sit down there with a doodle.

96
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,400
It's got a fucking sword.
Next year.

97
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,960
Neck.
Got Some Jack The ripper type shit.

98
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,680
I guess there's a bunch of Italians in 
Vegas right now because there's this new

99
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,990
Italian museum that's opening up right 
now,

100
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:21,810
the Italian museum.
So there's tons of Italians and mops.

101
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,240
Mafia kinda guys are in Vegas.
Mafia legend or they're just,

102
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:27,260
you know,
posters.

103
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,850
Yeah.
And it was the gun show this weekend.

104
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,430
And Avn.
Oh my God,

105
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,910
it was a fucking weird.
We should talk about that on the podcast

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,870
through this 10 commercial we're brought
to you by 10.

107
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,880
If you go to Rogan.ting.com,
you save 25 bucks off of either a phone 

108
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,040
or,
or even their service.

109
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,930
You can apply it to their services as 
well.

110
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,270
And they have some of the best,
uh,

111
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,470
Samsung Galaxy s three Samsung Galaxy 
note to some of the best android phones 

112
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:59,270
that are available.
Sounds sprint and or network

113
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,570
you,
you don't even know about this.

114
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:01,550
Yeah.
Tell me about the.

115
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,980
Announces a $100,000
etf payout fund,

116
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:07,800
which will reimburse switches up to $350
per line.

117
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,600
So what they're doing,
this is crazy.

118
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,030
This is insane that the phone companies 
doing this,

119
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:17,031
this is huge.
They are pretty much like if you have a 

120
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:17,910
contract with verizon,
if you cancel it's $350.

121
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,650
Usually it's like you're a year into the
contract and it's probably like $180.

122
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,010
What Ting is doing is if you switch over
to Qa Ting,

123
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,400
they will give you whatever that money 
is as credit.

124
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:33,210
So pretty much like if you pay,
you have $150 at verizon,

125
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,780
they're giving you a $150 credit on 
tings for all your,

126
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:39,480
your,
your use of a service through them.

127
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:42,200
So you won't have to pay anything for 
$150 credit.

128
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,370
Conceivably get like a free year.
Yeah,

129
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,150
yeah,
yeah.

130
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:49,200
If you have $350 now pretty much have a 
full year of free free cell phone,

131
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:49,800
sir.
That's,

132
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,600
that's very kind.
It is.

133
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,430
It's a very cool company and it's one of
the reasons why we,

134
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:56,840
uh,
we got connected with them.

135
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,140
I just love the fact

136
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,690
that they're trying to set up a company 
that's not trying to fuck you.

137
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,150
And that's like in their mission 
statement.

138
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,190
Not exactly,
but you know what I'm saying.

139
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,800
I mean I'm talking like a paraphrasing 
and shit,

140
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,400
but the bottom line is they wanted to 
make it so there's no contracts.

141
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,090
They want to sell you phones at a very 
reasonable rate and they want to put you

142
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:20,091
on a good network.
Sprint is one of the best networks in 

143
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:21,450
the country depending upon where you 
live.

144
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,760
Every phones,
depending upon where you live.

145
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,250
I don't think there's any one provider 
that hasn't nailed,

146
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,610
but a lot of people like and prefer the 
CDMA network that sprints on over like 

147
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,420
the t mobile GSM network or 18 and t GSM
network.

148
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:37,520
A lot of people say that,
uh,

149
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,030
the CDMA phones cut out less.
It's apparently it's older technology.

150
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,030
I'm too stupid to understand it,
but I know that people are pretty happy 

151
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,690
with the sprint service and it's fucking
cheap.

152
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,840
You,
you also can set it up so that you have 

153
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,381
one or more people can share an account 
so you can share an account with your 

154
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:57,381
wife so you can,
you know,

155
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:59,070
you could share minutes which is,
which is great,

156
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,780
you know,
if you,

157
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,830
if you don't use the phone that much.
And a lot of us today I fucking text a 

158
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:10,131
lot more than I make phone calls a lot 
more and that's the most important thing

159
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,930
to me is to be able to text and bill to 
get on the Internet.

160
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,160
Like my actual phone calls per day.
I do in my mind when I'm in my car,

161
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,230
you know,
so I could get work done while I'm 

162
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,230
driving,
but I'm not ready.

163
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm not using it like I used to.

164
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,630
I text so much more now than talking on 
the phone.

165
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,000
Which is weird because when you read 
somebody texts,

166
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:29,920
you're reading it how you want to read 
it,

167
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,980
like in your own head.
So it kind of makes me wonder if you are

168
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,850
kind of controlling who,
what people's opinions of you are.

169
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,270
Very deep philosophical way to look at 
basically contorting my world.

170
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,070
You're imposing my worldview on the 
people that are contacting me.

171
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,430
You're missing sarcasm.
Completely.

172
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:50,800
Think everybody actually does think 
you're the shit.

173
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,490
Here we go quite a bit depending on the 
number of texts you getting into.

174
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,140
Yeah,
go go to [inaudible] dot ting dot

175
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,230
comm.
Support a cool company that's uh,

176
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,710
that's there.
They're doing the right thing.

177
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,290
It's like,
I think the companies can make money and

178
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:10,291
not be consumed and Tang agrees and,
and that's why we have them as a 

179
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:14,971
sponsor.
The one thing that will guarantee you 

180
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:14,971
after,
I've said it a million times,

181
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:14,971
but I,
I have to repeat it.

182
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:19,510
We're never going to have someone 
sponsor this show that we don't believe 

183
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,790
in.
It's got to make some sense.

184
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,900
It's got to be a legit product.
And if it wasn't a legit product,

185
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,210
Brian and I will sit down and talk about
it and we would say,

186
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:26,170
fuck this.
Yeah,

187
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,090
we can't have these guys on.
This is stupid,

188
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,010
you know,
this is some bullshit.

189
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,940
So the people that were involved with as
least under our opinion,

190
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,670
it's all legit companies.
And if you're in a games,

191
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,580
one of our other sponsors is kerosene 
games and kerosene games has.

192
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,560
They have.
The second game is about to drop.

193
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,720
They're there.
They're in the final stages,

194
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:51,721
I believe,
but the first game is called Blade 

195
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:52,900
slinger and they're making all these 
games for ipads and iphones.

196
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,680
So it's not like a pc game has been 
over.

197
00:08:55,681 --> 00:09:00,681
Instead,
it's a fucking real legit high end game 

198
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:01,950
that's really cool to play.
It's fun.

199
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,110
It's cool to look at like visually 
they're fun.

200
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,470
It's any you play on an ipad means it's 
three bucks.

201
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,750
You just can't go wrong.
One apple editor's choice award and has 

202
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,151
been rated for at a four must have by 
many critics with a winning score of 

203
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:20,520
other industry accolades for quality and
excellence.

204
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,620
People have been saying it's a fucking 
bad ass game,

205
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,770
gets gets very good reviews.
You're always going to have to give a 

206
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,531
few bad reviews and if it wasn't.
If I saw something that didn't have a 

207
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:30,660
few bad reviews,
I'd be like,

208
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,010
you know what?

209
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,640
I don't believe them.
Don't trust it.

210
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,260
Yeah,
I think this is a dummy account.

211
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,080
You'd probably have to fucking pay 
somebody to be able to post here because

212
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,590
there's always comes out there.
They're going to find something.

213
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,740
I've heard the greatest songs ever and 
have people like,

214
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,240
oh my God,
that's whiny bullshit.

215
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:50,241
Like they'll.
They'll say something like that in the 

216
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:50,241
youtube comments.
There's always going to be that guy,

217
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:54,470
so if you have something that's 
universally praised that that sounds 

218
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,790
ridiculous,
but that said,

219
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,440
the praise for this game has been pretty
strong.

220
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,530
People love it.
If you're in this first person,

221
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,720
third person,
right?

222
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:06,360
Because you first person would be 
looking through his actual eyes.

223
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,070
I believe the finance game,
man,

224
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,400
I played this on the plane.
That's great for playing on the plane,

225
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:12,690
man.
You have your ipads.

226
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,620
I love.
I'm getting.

227
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,480
I'm using my.
I've had more and more lately.

228
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,940
Well,
you know what I love about

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,250
eight.
That is it.

230
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,280
You can take time.
That's bullshit time where you're stuck 

231
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,240
in a fucking plane and you make it fun 
and you can actually enjoy it.

232
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,660
Yeah.
So here is fucking some people up.

233
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,790
Anyway,
go buy that shit.

234
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,940
It's three bucks.
Alright,

235
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,990
your Fox.
We were also brought to you by 

236
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:35,990
[inaudible] dot com,
but we kind of talked about them.

237
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,120
The other thing.
So,

238
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,130
so,
uh,

239
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,220
go there o n n it used to code named 
Brogan and saved yourself 10 percent off

240
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,200
any and all supplements.
And remember,

241
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,850
if you haven't heard this before on it,
it's another company that absolutely is 

242
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,461
not trying to rip anybody off.
Sounded like I was sending you a secret 

243
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:57,730
message that I'm lying.
Yeah.

244
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,650
I was actually just an inopportune 
conference.

245
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,350
Drinking bulletproof coffee bitches.
This is grass fed butter.

246
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Upgraded coffee in a blender with mct 
oil because that's how Dave asprey 

247
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:09,560
roles.

248
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,730
And he taught me these things.
So.

249
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:13,860
Well the only problem is when you drink 
butter and coffee,

250
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,880
that's tickets fleming.
So when trying to talk tastes like 

251
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,970
you've got to load in your mouth,
you're so oily.

252
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,300
I'm a little oily.
Um,

253
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,200
but the,
um,

254
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,720
the thing about honest is any of the 
supplements you have 90 days,

255
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,960
100 percent money back guarantee.
You don't even have to return the 

256
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:32,960
product.
No one is trying to rip you off.

257
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,970
We're just selling you the very best 
shit that we can find out there.

258
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,980
And in that,
whether it's exercise equipment,

259
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,470
whether it's supplements,
whatever it is,

260
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,540
we're trying to sell you the very best 
shit and use a code name.

261
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:47,541
Rogan,
you will save 10 percent of any of the 

262
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:47,541
supplements,
right?

263
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:47,541
You Fox.
Listen,

264
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,580
Jimmy Smith is here from Bella tour 
fighting championships.

265
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:53,850
Was that other show requests,
requests from fight quests.

266
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,560
Quiches fellow MMA commentator.
We're going to break shit down.

267
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Experience Joe Rogan podcast by night.
Powerful Jimmy Smith.

268
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,500
Whoa.
You just abruptly.

269
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,530
You got crazy today.
The super aids he caught in Vegas this 

270
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,820
weekend.
It's affecting his mind's already 

271
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,820
affecting his work.
Performance.

272
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,730
Settle.
This may be a.

273
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,280
How many of us on the planet Earth Dudes
who do five?

274
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,920
If you're generous five or six,
if you're a generous,

275
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,080
generous.
Yeah.

276
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:32,670
This like you,
me,

277
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,680
and of course Pat Miletich.
Yeah.

278
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,590
This is a very smart.
I mean frank,

279
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,570
frank,
shamrock.

280
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,870
It's like how many guys?
Stephan Bonner does it.

281
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:44,740
He does it.
Well,

282
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,850
you know Kenny does a good job.
It's not that many people doing that.

283
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,710
So strange Gig,
isn't it?

284
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,560
It's weird and I'm sure you get the same
thing.

285
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,740
What I try and tell a lot of people,
I had a lot of fighters with outstanding

286
00:12:56,741 --> 00:13:01,741
careers.
We're seeing the retirement of the 

287
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:01,741
second generation.
You may not,

288
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:06,000
not the founders in a hoist and the 
second generation is starting to break 

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,890
down and retire and I've had guys 
literally coming up to me going,

290
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,060
how did you get this Gig?

291
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,310
Because if you think about it,
fuck,

292
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,950
did we get this job?
In a sense,

293
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,090
you know,
it's crazy,

294
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,410
but there are very few that actually do 
it.

295
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,030
Yeah.
There's so few.

296
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:25,031
And for folks who don't know,
Jimmy does the commentary for Bella 

297
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:26,500
tour,
which is the second biggest promotion in

298
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:29,500
the United States,
and they're there on spike tv now.

299
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,740
They've actually taken the position that
the UFC had and just had the first 

300
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,480
fight.
So you've been around a long ass time,

301
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:42,481
man.
You've been doing commentary like for 

302
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:42,481
for belt or for how long now?
Bella?

303
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:43,930
Towards three and one for six years.
I've been doing this.

304
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:47,400
I did anyone before before Bella tour,
so I did three years of commentary.

305
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,310
Nobody was listening to to get good at 
it.

306
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,900
It was cool that you had a little bit of
experience doing television stuff 

307
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,020
though,
but you were already loose enough.

308
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,950
Like your,
your,

309
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,530
your.
That's like a big thing for guys is just

310
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:02,890
figuring out how to loosen up so they 
can explain themselves.

311
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:07,891
It's,
it's a weird gig because the only one 

312
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:10,861
who's going to be able to do it is it's 
not going to be possible unless you 

313
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:10,861
don't.
Unless you train you,

314
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:12,100
you're not gonna,
you're not gonna.

315
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,950
Be able to see things you'll sound like 
a Douche to.

316
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,830
Yeah,
I don't.

317
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,020
I don't.
One thing that really personally bugs me

318
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,080
about commentary is when people question
somebody and they haven't been there 

319
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,350
when it's.
When it's,

320
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,410
you know,
I got a lot of people question 

321
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,230
somebodies heart or they get hit,
they go down from a body shot,

322
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,990
you've been hit in the liver,
you go down and if you've trained,

323
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,010
if you sparred,
you know that,

324
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,120
and people that don't and and I think 
are hard on fighters and question our 

325
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,890
heart,
a questionnaire design when they haven't

326
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,650
been there and gone through that.
That bugs me.

327
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,820
Yeah.
You know,

328
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,310
that does bug me.
That bugs me a lot.

329
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,010
What else bugs me is people saying that 
they know who's gonna win.

330
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,300
That bugs me.
I mean,

331
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:52,100
I'll talk shit on occasion if like I

332
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,550
see a match up and I go,
oh,

333
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:54,970
there's no fucking way.
Like this is.

334
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:57,030
This is a crazy matchup.
Like whatsapp Petrocelli.

335
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,280
Ellie fought Kimbo.
Yeah.

336
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,350
I made a video of it.
I was in a green room in Atlanta and we 

337
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,711
were about to watch the fight and I 
thought it was Ken shamrock and 

338
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:06,711
literally right before the fight I got 
off stage.

339
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:09,090
I'm like,
it's about to happen right now and I can

340
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:09,920
chat box out.
I go,

341
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,070
he's out.
I go,

342
00:15:11,071 --> 00:15:11,910
who's fighting?
And they go,

343
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,750
set petrus.
I go,

344
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,600
oh no,
sets going to kill him.

345
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,490
Like Steph Petros.
Ellie is legit.

346
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,920
The people in the know knew how that 
fight was.

347
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,930
Yeah,
but the people that fucking crazy people

348
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:26,450
over at CBS who said yes to that or 
whatever.

349
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,920
Was it CBS,
CBS at the time.

350
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:29,360
I like,
who do you have?

351
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,790
Anybody that knows mma.
That's a mismatch.

352
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,110
That's a gross mismatch.

353
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,500
You and I know the disconnect between 
the people that put mma on TV and the 

354
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:42,430
people that know mma is huge.
It can be,

355
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,480
can be,
can be huge network people.

356
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:48,800
The people that put him on tv don't 
always know a man.

357
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,420
It crops up a lot

358
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,440
because you and I essentially we sort of
established positions in the sport doing

359
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,710
commentary like as it grew and it became
this thing that it is now.

360
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,220
While we know when we both started out,
I mean you go back to six years ago,

361
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,400
it was not nearly as big as it is now.
It's bananas how big it is now and it 

362
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,760
sort of happened.
I guess it was really.

363
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:16,761
If you want to break it down,
and it actually happened around eight 

364
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:16,761
years ago,
right?

365
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:20,540
Ultimate fighter.
That was really the biggie eight years 

366
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:20,540
ago.

367
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:20,650
Was it 2004 to their,
whatever,

368
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,660
whatever it is,
that area in that area from there that 

369
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:25,790
started this,
but like the,

370
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,800
the level that it's at right now,
like the fame of a GSP or an Anderson 

371
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,130
Silva,
Jon Jones,

372
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,750
like,
that's,

373
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,190
they're right up there with basically 
any athlete in pro sports.

374
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,330
The top level guys like they're talked 
about on a,

375
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,920
in bars and in the same way people talk 
about plays and games.

376
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,690
They talk about GSP,
you know,

377
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,520
landing at giant knee or something like 
that.

378
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,150
It's uh,
it's,

379
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:51,270
it's interesting how this has happened.
And while while tapping.

380
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,050
I mean we essentially just had to figure
out our own way through it,

381
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,380
you know,
and learning like what's the best rules 

382
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,080
and it seeing the rules change and 
think.

383
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,170
Like when I first started there was bare
knuckle and you can wear shoes.

384
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,130
I,
that was UFC 12,

385
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,360
that was the first UFC I ever did 
commentary on.

386
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,260
I did a post fight interviews rather and
uh,

387
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,300
to so to see it from there,
go to where it is now with flyweights 

388
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,860
and bantams and feathers and lightweight
cement.

389
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,710
There's a lot of lightweight guys now.

390
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:26,830
The first time I fought was that a thing
called neutral grounds and central 

391
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,380
grounds and pankration pin crace.
It was kind of amateur,

392
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,700
but not really ms dot back in the day 
when it wasn't sanctioned in California,

393
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,830
they literally had everybody line up and
I was next to this dude and they went,

394
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,770
you guys simply fighting each other.
We didn't weigh in nothing.

395
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,680
And we went in and we thought that was,
that was how it worked.

396
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,570
They use open hands,
right?

397
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,760
Right.
We weren't

398
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,880
to the stakes of the body.
We had no gloves on.

399
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,910
And this is how crazy I remember.
I used to be really nuts and there's a 

400
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,491
bunch of weird rules in mma that there's
just total ignorance and from just 

401
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:06,290
misconceptions about w w,
one of them is at one of them is that 

402
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,200
downward elbow.
The downward elbow is a crazy one.

403
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,240
It makes no sense.
The reason why the 12 to six elbow is 

404
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,630
illegal,
big John Mccarthy told me this,

405
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,810
that when they were describing the 
martial arts techniques to the athletic 

406
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,861
commissions,
the guy was one of the guys that worked 

407
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:24,321
for you.
That letter commission said you can't 

408
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:26,151
have them do that thing with their 
elbows because I've seen that on TV and 

409
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:26,151
they can break boards by Golly,
what?

410
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:31,020
What?
What would it do to a person's skull 

411
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,120
like this guy thought for some reason 
that this was in any way,

412
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:38,121
shape or form as bad as Anderson Silva 
kneeing you in the head makes no sense 

413
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:38,370
at all.

414
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,970
It makes no sense at all.
Legitimately ridiculous.

415
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:46,971
Yeah,
but it's a rule that's in place like 

416
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:48,300
strictly because of ignorance and there 
was so many of those in the beginning.

417
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,370
Nobody knew what the right thing to do 
was.

418
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,060
They were like,
well,

419
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,440
you can't have mma,
and they're like,

420
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:57,441
okay,
well when if we wrestle and slap fight 

421
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:57,441
like,
okay,

422
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,450
no sense at all,
but we're going to go with it.

423
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,480
That was what it was for a while.
You would have pankration fights and 

424
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,900
pankration fights.
They would pull their hands back.

425
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,960
It was real.
Bas rutten was the only dude who ever 

426
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:11,960
figured out how to deliver like 
ridiculous.

427
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,690
He could knock out one of those.
Yeah,

428
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,470
because boss has this crazy anatomy 
first voice,

429
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,500
these giant ass long hands and he 
figured out how to pull his hands way 

430
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,771
back,
so that is like his fingers were almost 

431
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:25,560
like facing towards him.
So it's like a punch.

432
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,420
He's punching you with his palm.
It's.

433
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:30,630
You're not catching any of the fingers.
Nothing's absorbing.

434
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,750
The idea I guess,
of a slab being easier is that your 

435
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,780
fingers are absorbing some of the impact
and your hand is moving back,

436
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:39,570
which takes away that,
but boss is hitting you with this.

437
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,570
He's like straight punching you with his
palm.

438
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,610
Do you remember the exchange when frank 
shamrock went for a leg lock on him and 

439
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,700
bosses John and Frank Smile and Adam and
laugh.

440
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,690
There's a problem with that.
There is a problem with your rule system

441
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,740
when that's happening.
Yeah.

442
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:57,100
That was ridiculous.
It was funny though.

443
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,650
Frank Shamrock is funny and that fight,
it developed,

444
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:01,480
and I say this all the time,
MMA now,

445
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,510
it developed from for good or for bad,
from a sport of martial artists to 

446
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,391
support of athletes.
Now it's a sport of athletes that don't 

447
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:13,981
necessarily like we're talking about 
right before the podcast about Roy 

448
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:13,981
Mcdonald,
what a bad ass he is.

449
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,150
The guy started mma at 14.
He didn't grow up doing kilkenny.

450
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,180
He didn't.
He doesn't come from martial artist 

451
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,180
background who said,
oh,

452
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,650
I'll turn this into mma.
These guys just studying them and they 

453
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:25,650
approach it like,
like you're saying,

454
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,180
the NFL or the NBA or any other big time
sport and that's come with advantages 

455
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,490
and disadvantages.
Well,

456
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:33,240
their training,
like professional athletes right now,

457
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,400
there is a massive difference in your 
ability to move your ability to 

458
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,321
withstand shots,
the ability to keep your energy levels 

459
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:45,250
up when you're training in the gym and 
you know,

460
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:48,060
especially if you're doing just only or 
only

461
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,260
grappling,
you can get in tremendous shape.

462
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,620
But in this day and age it seems like it
to beat a GSP to beat like the highest 

463
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,570
of highest levels.
Competitors,

464
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,210
you got to be both.
You got to be both.

465
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,950
A martial artist is very technical and 
you also have to put the fucking time in

466
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:08,320
that you don't want to put into that 
strength and conditioning.

467
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:10,630
You got to do it.
I know nobody wants to.

468
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,550
Nobody wants to.
Nobody wants to do battle ropes.

469
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,570
You don't want to fucking her old ropes 
until your body feels like it's going to

470
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,590
explode,
but if you don't do it,

471
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,860
there could be just that little less 
juice that you don't have in the third 

472
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,270
and it causes you to either get caught 
or it causes your opponent to get away 

473
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,850
from something when you caught them in 
something,

474
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,130
but you just can't squeeze it and it 
gets out of it and you're like,

475
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:30,670
fuck.

476
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,730
The only thing,
the only time that isn't wasted in 

477
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,341
training is cardio training.
Let's say you spend all your time on 

478
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:38,341
boxing.
Oh,

479
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:39,250
you're talking about boxing the guys a 
better boxer.

480
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,970
You fuck yeah.
You spent that time inappropriately.

481
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,980
You have x number of hours in the gym.
There's no negative to being in better 

482
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,160
shape than the other guy.
There's no nate.

483
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:53,161
We were just talking about it.
There's no negative to being in better 

484
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:53,161
shape.
You can be guys that are better than you

485
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,670
if you can wear them out.
If that happens.

486
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:56,290
It happens all the time.
It's happened to me.

487
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:01,291
I've.
I've had guys that I usually tap like 

488
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,091
crazy.
Then I'll go to the gym and I'll be out 

489
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:03,091
of shape and I'll get dominated,
you know,

490
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:05,530
I'll get mounted and my mother fucker.
It's like I'm not in shape for it and if

491
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:06,820
you're not in shape that just.

492
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,770
It's a fact that you're not gonna be 
able to defend.

493
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:12,850
You're not going to be able to execute 
to the fullest of abilities.

494
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,880
The hardest part is I'm on the road 12 
weeks in a row because I have 12 week 

495
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:17,880
season,
so I'm literally gone.

496
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,840
I fly out tomorrow.
I don't get back till Friday morning,

497
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,370
so I'm really home on the weekends.
I said,

498
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,440
do you train when you're,
when you're on the road.

499
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,900
When I see that's the problem is,
you know,

500
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm working out pitbull brothers in the 
elevator.

501
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,150
They turn to the translator and go,
pippa wants to know if you want to roll 

502
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,370
with him,
go to my gym.

503
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,400
I go to my room.
I changed that would go and I with 

504
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,400
people brother for two hours.
I'm not in.

505
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
That kind of shaped me fight.
The next day he's speaking.

506
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,300
He's like,
Daniel Gracie was an ed.

507
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,460
Jimmy went roll with me and I'm like,
all right,

508
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,370
you know,
but you're not in that kind of shape.

509
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,290
You're in their training with animals 
and I go home for days to come home.

510
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,480
I just don't have the time.
You know,

511
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,550
back when I was fine,
I was six day a week guy and that's 

512
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,070
where these guys are and it's like I'm 
fighting with guys,

513
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:58,060
you know,
world champs,

514
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,870
and I'm like,
oh,

515
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,080
these people kind of don't understand 
the level of conditioning that's 

516
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,440
required to compete in mma.
It's,

517
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:07,540
it's so taken for granted.
Unfortunately.

518
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:11,710
It's like the.
There's the aspect of the sport that has

519
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:16,711
to do with what kind of shape you're in 
is so gigantic and there's levels and 

520
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:22,171
some guys like a Frankie Edgar,
they never let the cardio dropoff and 

521
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:24,310
every time you see them you can tell 
they've been pushing it.

522
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,440
They've been pushing it and you build a 
base,

523
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,650
you get like a Nick Diaz type base.
Like Nick Diaz has such a strong cardio 

524
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:35,680
base because he's constantly swimming,
constantly biking,

525
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:40,681
constantly running.
His cardio is sensational and you can't 

526
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:41,230
keep up.
You can't.

527
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:46,231
He will drown you if you get in a fight 
like that would nick Diaz is one of 

528
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:46,231
those like who

529
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:49,670
can keep up this pace fight.
He's going to go 60 percent on you,

530
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,380
maybe 70 percent and then you're gonna 
be.

531
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:57,420
You're not gonna be able to keep up,
you know you're going to try to mix it 

532
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:57,640
in with 100 percent,
but it's Chins made out of

533
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
volume.
Puncher.

534
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,750
There's a bobby to up Paul Williams for 
the,

535
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,480
for the boxing fans out there.
He was a great boxer.

536
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:08,530
He recently got paralyzed an accident,
but he throw a 150 punches around 100.

537
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,630
It's just,
that's nick deist.

538
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,930
He just throws so many punches so I just
won't go away so I will not go away.

539
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,370
And his chin,
his iron,

540
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,280
it allows them.
He's very relaxed so he rolls with shit 

541
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,640
good.
And he's never committing to a punch.

542
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:26,641
You never catch him committing on.
You never get that big counter punch 

543
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:26,670
because he's right.
He's slapping.

544
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,060
You saw such an important point that you
can't catch him with a counter shot.

545
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,330
There's a dude named Michael Jai white 
who's a very,

546
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,040
very smart dude and a great martial 
artist as well.

547
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,280
People don't know.
You seem in movies.

548
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,290
You think he's not like a real martial 
artist now.

549
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,070
He's totally legit.
He's going to.

550
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,720
He's the one that joker cut a new mouth 
in a.

551
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:46,970
He played

552
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,700
in that Tyson documentary,
but anyway,

553
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,750
my point is he was explaining like dude 
is a lifelong martial artists and he was

554
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:59,650
explaining to Kimbo Kimbo we're talking 
about throwing jabs and throwing punches

555
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,220
from just a relaxed position and that 
when when someone does that,

556
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:04,690
you don't even see it comment.
It just,

557
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:07,480
it just lands and they were like going 
over this,

558
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,030
like something that that's something 
that a lot of people don't realize.

559
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,060
When you tense up and you're like,
telegraph,

560
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:18,090
you're gonna your chances of hitting the
guy are significantly lower than if you 

561
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,381
just hit him.
He hit him like that and it got like 

562
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:22,540
Nick Diaz is not training.
It's not full blast.

563
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,190
It's mechanical.
It's like tap,

564
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,240
tap,
pap pap,

565
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:30,241
pap pap.
It's mechanical and you starting to see 

566
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:31,140
stars and then you'll step back and 
like,

567
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,710
I'm going to blast this.
Do to get him off me.

568
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,730
No,
you're not.

569
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,330
No,
you're not.

570
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,770
No,
you're going to try to,

571
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,920
but then you going to wear yourself out 
with that big explosion that you can't 

572
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,560
keep up with and he's going to keep 60 
percent of your pap pap pap pap.

573
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,210
What people don't understand is there's 
x amount of training sessions you can go

574
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,160
through in your career.
There are x amount of hours.

575
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:53,161
You can train their x amount of punches.
You can throw how you spend that energy 

576
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:54,410
defines how you are as a fighter.
Yeah.

577
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,700
Nick Diaz is not a knockout punch,
never been knockout punches.

578
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,760
He throws so many that you're eventually
done.

579
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,820
He'll up.
He dropped Robbie lawler drop with 

580
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,260
Jacksons you.
It was just sort of fade away.

581
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,280
Jose Fadeaway Jab that Robbie lawler 
step right into [inaudible].

582
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,080
That frustration.
That's what he does too.

583
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:13,450
He unloads until you're just like,
you get frustrated,

584
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,370
you do something stupid and that's when 
he takes you out.

585
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,940
You have fight to was all of the classic
shit talk and fights.

586
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,710
Oh,
that was awesome because that was one of

587
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:21,590
the first.
He kept doing it.

588
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,370
See Nick

589
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,940
get he got into the octagon and as he 
got into the octagon,

590
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:27,830
he looks over at robby law and he's got 
his arms out.

591
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:29,870
He goes,
Stockton motherfucker.

592
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,320
And he starts pacing back and forth and 
you can see Robbie lawler is like,

593
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:37,430
what is going on here?
Like Nick Diaz claiming the two,

594
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:38,150
oh,
nine.

595
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:43,151
And walk out with his arms out.
And then he proceeded to just talk mad 

596
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:47,201
shit through the whole fight.
And you could tell Robbie lawler was 

597
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:47,201
like,
why?

598
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:47,201
It's,
you know,

599
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:51,561
it's funny.
I should I call me to break down the 

600
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:51,561
last.
The Da has been Henderson fight.

601
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:55,590
His brother Nate took similar fighting 
style course and he said,

602
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:58,740
what do you think of all that?
That Nate Diaz come get me,

603
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,490
you know,
all the,

604
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,380
the MCGINN and throwing her hands up in 
the shit talking.

605
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,500
Uh,
their footwork isn't great.

606
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,000
And what it did is he's brings you into 
that zone with the Mcginn and to come on

607
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:09,690
in.
And the thing is,

608
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:13,020
is that when you saw that,
saw that same problem,

609
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:13,740
uh,
with,

610
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,850
with,
with nick,

611
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,490
against Carlos Condit,
if you don't engage him,

612
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,580
his footwork isn't great.
He's a little flat foot and he throws 

613
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:22,830
his punches and a lot of that and come 
on,

614
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:24,540
come get me,
is come into my range,

615
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,970
come into my kind of fight,
you know what I mean?

616
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:29,010
And that's,
it's very calculated what it Robbie do.

617
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,550
He stepped in eight,
really a jab hook,

618
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,730
not,
not a super hard punishment,

619
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,220
stepped right into it,
boom and went face down on the mat.

620
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,280
And that's part of the strategy.

621
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,630
Interesting about the Carlos condit 
fight with Carlos condit fight.

622
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,780
Very similar to the way he throws his 
techniques,

623
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,800
but he just did it moving away and 
picked his own spots,

624
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,630
picked his own bots and moved away.
But like,

625
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,960
like when he landed that head kick,
you could tell just by the way,

626
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:55,910
landed.
That is not a full blast head kick.

627
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,340
He just thrown it up there quick to land
it,

628
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,500
just because he can,
if he does it that way,

629
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,430
it really took a page out of Nick's book
and I totally think it is.

630
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,510
Yeah,
I totally think it is.

631
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,490
I think a lot of guys,
I mean,

632
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,520
you think you have to,
to deal with that style because the 

633
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:11,520
fucking guy doesn't get tired.
It doesn't get tired.

634
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,710
It takes a tremendous shot.
That's a bad combination.

635
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,140
You know,
like Kj noons was able to cut,

636
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:17,030
um,
and that was successful in that way,

637
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:22,031
but you know,
but then nick outboxed him in the 

638
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:22,031
rematch,
you know,

639
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:23,210
the only one to really outboxed him.

640
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Joel rigs,
diesel rigs up possibly land a little 

641
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,121
bit harder.
Just I think landed with a little more 

642
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:31,121
forced.
Remember,

643
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:31,121
you want a decision against nick in the 
UFC.

644
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:32,830
What about Jeremy Jackson?
The earliest.

645
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,100
Jeremy Jackson,
way back in the Janet Jackson is a waste

646
00:28:36,101 --> 00:28:36,910
of talent.
Man.

647
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,800
Jeremy Jackson was a real waste of 
talent.

648
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,620
Unfortunately,
their kid had whatever issues,

649
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,650
you know,
he got kicked off of the ultimate 

650
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:47,650
fighter,
I believe,

651
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,470
and he's got some really big legal 
problems now he's in prison.

652
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,140
It doesn't get a lot bigger than doing 
life.

653
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,330
I don't know what he did.
I don't know what the crime was,

654
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:58,940
what he was accused of and whether or 
not he actually did it,

655
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:01,190
but I physically.
That dude,

656
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:03,260
he was a great boxer.
To this day,

657
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,870
he's the only guy to stop,
uh,

658
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,870
Nick Diaz because besides the Kj noon 
cut,

659
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,180
which is just the doctor saying that 
it's the cuts too bad.

660
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,100
It wasn't like that.
He was in danger.

661
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:18,101
It was just,
he couldn't see blood was pouring into 

662
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:18,101
his eyes and it just looks really 
grizzly.

663
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:19,910
But Jeremy Jackson stopped him like 
legitimate.

664
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:21,830
And Nick was really young at the time.
It was,

665
00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:22,910
you know,
I think he was only 18.

666
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,620
Yeah,
it was a right hand over the jab.

667
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:27,590
Yeah.
That low jab and he hadn't quite learned

668
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,400
to keep that hand up and use and volume 
punch guest who's coming in eight a 

669
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,440
right hand over the top and just stunned
him.

670
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:33,860
And that was it.

671
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,160
He had some hands,
man.

672
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,230
He had some hands when there wasn't.
There wasn't that much in the UFC in 

673
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,470
terms of like,
he was like,

674
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:42,790
he had like Jens pulver type knockout 
power.

675
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:45,880
Yeah.
It was sad to see that guy.

676
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,910
It's like he came along and mma just a 
little too early and to have the main,

677
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,610
the endurance to get from the uh,
Nick Diaz,

678
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:59,810
you know,
18 year old stage where mma was then to 

679
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,780
get to be like a pro today.
A few few guys.

680
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,980
Nobody.
Few guys.

681
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,900
Josh Barnett Barnett.
Yeah.

682
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,650
Josh is a rare,
rare example of a guy who's been in the 

683
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,200
game a long fucking time and still 
competes at the top level.

684
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,160
The thing that rob lava number one,
19 to 29,

685
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,220
you know,
the thing is you have to be open to the 

686
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,430
kind of changes that destroy athletes.
You have to be open to men.

687
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:29,590
Men,
men past six years has gone from three 

688
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,530
to 10 as far as the talent level and the
competitive pettiness of it.

689
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,520
And to stay in the mix,
even to stay in the discussion that long

690
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:41,090
is unbelievable.
You have to make the kind of cardio 

691
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,761
commitments and training commitments 
that a lot of people with that I would 

692
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:47,661
say in the beginning,
martial arts mentality of this is the 

693
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:47,661
way I do things.
Didn't make it.

694
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:49,140
They didn't make that transition and a 
few great athletes did.

695
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,460
And that's why they're still around.
Yeah.

696
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,510
It's a weird time to see those

697
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,640
guys that uh,
didn't.

698
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,840
It didn't quite come along at the right 
time.

699
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,260
Yeah.
You,

700
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,280
you only have a certain amount of time 
that you can go balls out in mma and 

701
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,930
it's,
it varies depending upon your style and 

702
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,110
varies depending upon grappling.
I think a lot of it is really saves a 

703
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,120
lot of guys like randy,
you know,

704
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:17,121
randy was able to continue his career 
like way longer than he probably would 

705
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,400
have if he was a pure striker,
you know,

706
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:23,401
it's the fact that he was able to,
even though he took some big shots and 

707
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:26,061
some of the fights,
he was able to close the distance a lot 

708
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:29,211
of the time and he's able to control 
guys up against the cage a lot of the 

709
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:30,270
time and that minimized like a lot of 
damage that he could have taken.

710
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:31,980
It allowed him to extend his career 
with,

711
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,470
you know,
just through the intelligence.

712
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,160
Look at this physical gifts that go 
first.

713
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,840
Yeah,
speed time.

714
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:41,841
Your kids a shot.
Roy Jones Jr went off a cliff because 

715
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:42,300
once you lose that,
it doesn't come back.

716
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,690
Well,
I think with no one's

717
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,520
junior are you also have to consider 
neurological damage.

718
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,200
Oh,
severely.

719
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:50,460
Severely.
But it's one thing I hate saying that,

720
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,890
but if you want to be a realist,
yeah.

721
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:58,060
You have to look at the Glen Johnson 
fight where he was completely out cold 

722
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,600
and the fact that it was shortly after 
the tarver fight that yet,

723
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,460
you know,
cleaned.

724
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,120
You know what got ruined him man,
when he went down in weight,

725
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,260
cutting weight from the fight back to 
lift heavy weights.

726
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,430
A lot of folks don't know he won the 
heavyweight title.

727
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:13,970
He fought John Ruiz and a box his 
fucking face off.

728
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:15,910
It was beautiful.
It was a beautiful fight.

729
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,600
I mean,
you're talking about a guy won his first

730
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:22,601
title at one slash 68 and all of a 
sudden he's fighting as a heavyweight 

731
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:26,560
and fighting grain and there's also.
You got to question what the fuck he 

732
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,840
took to get to be a heavyweight and when
you get off that shit,

733
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,510
the reality is in your body,
it stuns your body.

734
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:37,511
Your testicles stop producing 
testosterone and his body looked way 

735
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:38,840
smoother and the tarver fight than we 
had ever seen him before.

736
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:42,060
He like depleted.
He didn't look good and he was,

737
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,480
you know,
he was really weak from that weight cut.

738
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,700
The great thing about sports,
mma,

739
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,730
any sport is that you see people that 
are doing things that seemed beyond the 

740
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:54,500
physical limits.
That's what sports is all about.

741
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,790
Your body will pay you back.
You cannot keep its,

742
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,800
you know,
cannot keep pushing that envelope and 

743
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:03,800
you know,
the,

744
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:03,800
the,
the fighters that do that,

745
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,020
that we see pushing them up all the 
time.

746
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,630
There's a price to pay your body will 
come back at you and,

747
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:11,660
and,
and that's just a human fact of life.

748
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,940
And as competent as we see so many 
fighters in so many various stages of 

749
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,471
their careers and we kind of see the 
longterm in a way a lot of other people 

750
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:24,071
don't because once somebody gets off a 
fan's rate or they're still on our 

751
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:24,071
radar,
they have to be.

752
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:24,071
That's our job.
Yeah.

753
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,430
Like Pedro,
his own for example.

754
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:26,900
Hey Joe,
here's a perfect example.

755
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,800
Okay,
you,

756
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,770
we saw him from knocking out Josh 
Barnett,

757
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:35,771
which by the way,
new MMA fans who haven't seen that 

758
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:35,771
fight,
get it on youtube.

759
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:36,410
Watch that fight.
When he knocked out Josh Barnett,

760
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,590
amazing.
First Time everybody knows I get to the 

761
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,930
end of his career,
everybody knows I get a boner for leg 

762
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:43,930
kicks.
The kid,

763
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,760
that guy,
I've never been like,

764
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,180
I've never felt pain through another 
guy.

765
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:51,120
Feeling pain the way you do when Pedro,
his own leg.

766
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:54,870
Take somebody because your whole body 
tightens up like you hear that thud.

767
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:56,130
You Go,
oh my God,

768
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,460
he kicked so fucking hard.
The hardest leg kicks I've ever seen in 

769
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:01,460
MMA.

770
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,230
He had him limping

771
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,380
ready for Rehab for six months,
for six months.

772
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,120
He had to rehabilitate his leg.

773
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:15,280
He rehabbed leg kicked injuries for six 
fucking months.

774
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,580
That's how hard pedro.
Here's a fucks your legs out a fight and

775
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:22,300
he creates these weird welts like for 
the rest of your life,

776
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:27,301
you're going to have these weird like 
vein welts where your veins like you 

777
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:28,930
ever seen like randy has those.
And uh,

778
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,990
Kevin Randleman has those.
He has a lot of Moitai guys.

779
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:36,991
Get those to those weird.
That's from like just severe punishment 

780
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,010
over and over again to your leg.
You developed these weeds.

781
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,750
The wall of the vein start,
start giving out from getting hit.

782
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:44,590
Oh Geez,
I called North Hollywood Moitai,

783
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,740
which was Ramallah pet and guys like 
that with train was all tied there and 

784
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,590
it was amazing training and yeah,
the guy,

785
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:53,830
all the traders walk around like that 
and they had their shins are like steel.

786
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,300
I mean they were literally like,
like iron.

787
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,130
So they don't feel their shins anymore 
because you,

788
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,930
you,
you hit the skin so much that it becomes

789
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,300
like a knuckle.
It's like,

790
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:07,310
it's weird.
Like those guys had been doing it their 

791
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,981
whole life.
They literally don't feel shit like 

792
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:10,950
regularly people kick ropes that they 
wrap around like a poll.

793
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,760
They just thought the leg into the rope 
over and over again just to deaden it.

794
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So that becomes like a weapon and that 
shit is slamming into the meat of your 

795
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,400
fucking thigh.
Ugh.

796
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:25,490
The thing is,
and I tell marshal people into various 

797
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:25,490
combat sports,
I go,

798
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,290
MMA is like,
I call it the dark side of martial arts 

799
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:30,600
or combat sports,
quicker,

800
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,950
easier,
more seductive.

801
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,360
Those guys have more in Thailand.
200 fights.

802
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,870
You have your first one or two fights 
for anybody knows if you are.

803
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,190
It's dead serious.

804
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,620
Hundred.
One hundred.

805
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,920
200 fights.
Okay.

806
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,110
Sandra.
I saw kickstarters like 240 fights,

807
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,320
30 laws where the hell it is and people 
that don't understand the culture will 

808
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,870
never be able to wrap their head around 
the way they do.

809
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,210
They fight at a very young age and they 
take on the last name of their gym.

810
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,030
It's almost like a slavery sort of a 
situation like they own.

811
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,790
You Baucau had big problems with his 
gym.

812
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,740
Yeah,
I understood.

813
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,270
He recently left.
Right.

814
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,420
And isn't that,
is that the.

815
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,350
Is his name or is it.
I think it was Jim's name.

816
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,760
That's the name.
Yeah.

817
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,510
Bull cow is his actual actual net,
if I'm not mistaken.

818
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,470
They take on the and it's a weird thing,
but those guys,

819
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,190
they know they take the first round off 
essentially first and the fifth verse.

820
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,450
Yeah.
If you go to Thailand the first round I 

821
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:29,450
saw a great fight.

822
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:29,450
It wasn't great.
It was fun.

823
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:34,000
Uh,
in Thailand a Turkish dude was fighting 

824
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000
a tiger and I was like one 60,
which is a heavyweight in Thailand,

825
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,670
and the first round the target,
just feeling them out,

826
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,790
not really throwing anything.
And the Turkish guys going,

827
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:44,120
this guy is scared or something.
He thought he was scared and kind of 

828
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,120
went after him,
talked to just defending whatever.

829
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,090
And he thought he was kicking ass.
Second round the tag I opened up on him,

830
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,040
crushed his leg.
They stopped the fight.

831
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,380
Second round,
they take the first round off,

832
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,240
they take the first round off,
they fight rounds two,

833
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:59,241
three and four,
and then the fifth round they take off 

834
00:36:59,241 --> 00:36:59,241
because they know who won already.
And I was asking my instructor go,

835
00:36:59,241 --> 00:36:59,820
why are they just walking around and go,
well,

836
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:01,410
they already know who won and they fight
next week.

837
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,910
He goes,
he fight next week.

838
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:03,990
So it's like,
okay,

839
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:06,710
you win.
And why it was weird like as an American

840
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,690
mentality is,
you know,

841
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,330
last round fucking I'm behind you go 
crazy.

842
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:10,410
Yeah,
they don't really do that.

843
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,400
They fight rounds two,
three,

844
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:16,401
and four,
and then fifth round they take off 

845
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:16,401
because he already won.
I got to fight in 10 days.

846
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,190
When your career is 255,
one last and hold.

847
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,510
It's so fascinating that literally one 
style figured out how like what is the 

848
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:29,931
most effective?
What is the most economic use of your 

849
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:32,811
physical tools when it comes to striking
and there's one group of people in this 

850
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:35,940
one small chain of islands when it was 
Thailand's a couple islands,

851
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:36,350
right?
Yeah.

852
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,090
Yeah.
If you consider put cat island,

853
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:38,610
his apartment.
Yeah.

854
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,560
These motherfuckers figured out how to 
do it.

855
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,590
Kick the shit out of your legs,
elbow you in the face flying knees and 

856
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:45,600
it's like,
man,

857
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:47,310
you know,
if you don't know that stuff,

858
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,200
all the other stuff becomes invalid.

859
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,900
When it comes to stand up,
do you need all the other stuff?

860
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,210
But if you don't understand those leg 
kicks,

861
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
if you don't know how to check them,
if you don't,

862
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,890
especially if you get a pedro,
his type dude hitting you,

863
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,040
you don't.
There's guys that can hit you over and 

864
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040
over again in the legs and you can take 
it and you can have,

865
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,570
you know,
they can hit you like 20 times and 

866
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:08,570
you'll still be moving around the end of
the fight,

867
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,870
but then this pedro,
his who was a couple of those,

868
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,370
you hear that,
hear that meat cutting shin.

869
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:18,060
Just dig into the dudes thigh and you 
see the look in his eyes and you go,

870
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:23,061
oh Lord,
they've got so many of the misery of 

871
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:26,001
fighting guy like that,
which I had to do in Thailand a couple 

872
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,780
times is it doesn't knock you out.
Please knock me out.

873
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:30,800
I can go down onto the fight.
So you're standing there in it.

874
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,810
You either quit or you keep going,
you.

875
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,830
That's it.
That's your choice.

876
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:36,100
When the kicks you like

877
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,100
that is,
I can either quit because this sucks or 

878
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,100
I can keep going.
It's not like a knockout.

879
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,070
We're like bang,

880
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,170
canvas and it's over.
Have you ever been stopped from?

881
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,660
Never.
Never.

882
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:46,890
It sucks.
I mean,

883
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,470
I've had trouble walking the next day,
but I never quit because of it.

884
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,260
You know who's going to hit you so fuck,
oh God.

885
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:54,780
It's horrible.
It's horrible and it's such an easy.

886
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:59,781
It's like an economic movement.
You know the movement of the Thai leg 

887
00:38:59,781 --> 00:39:00,720
kick.
It's not something that requires a great

888
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:03,630
amount of strength like a wheel kick or 
spinning back kick.

889
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:08,631
It doesn't require a lot of dexterity.
It's natural for the average human 

890
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:09,450
being.
That's one of the cool things about it.

891
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:12,820
It's like if you understand the 
technique involved in more time,

892
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:17,830
what ties,
so prizing really technical and you can 

893
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,961
see a lot of guys who are not athletic 
specimens but they excel at it because 

894
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:23,940
their technique is so good.
They know what to do when this happens.

895
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,610
They know what to do with that happens.
They've gone through it so many times in

896
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:31,611
the gym,
they throw that left hook of your red 

897
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:34,100
legs there,
that right leg kicks comment and then 

898
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,100
the jabs falling behind it and these 
combinations,

899
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,090
he's classic combinations.
They start to get through,

900
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:41,091
so even like a guy who's more athletic 
can't fuck with a guy who's more 

901
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:43,950
technical and more time,
more so even than boxing.

902
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,220
Boxing,
when you shut it down to just two things

903
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,010
left hand,
right hand and all the combinations that

904
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:53,880
you could step man,
it's super athletic guy like a Roy Jones

905
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,460
Jr is always going to be the slow,
cumbersome guy.

906
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,760
Yeah.
The thing about a Thai kick in,

907
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,450
and I've been hit with every kind of 
kick.

908
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,130
Don't fight questions,
stuff like that.

909
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,980
Um,
it's not hard to see.

910
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:10,170
There are only really three targets.
They hit your leg to hit your ribs to 

911
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,190
hit your head,
but it doesn't matter if you get 

912
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,190
something there.
All right.

913
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,190
I see them hit for my ribs and you block
it.

914
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,430
They don't care.
They'll throw one at your elbow.

915
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:16,890
I saw Andy Sour fight,
Yeltsin cloudfare texts.

916
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,080
You know anything about Moitai.
That's an amazing matchup.

917
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,650
By the end,
Andy sours arm was like bright purple 

918
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,640
and swollen because he kept blocking me 
and blocking it.

919
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,380
He don't put your elbow,
the throat,

920
00:40:28,381 --> 00:40:28,870
your Shin.

921
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,360
They don't care.
When you have a guy who hits really hard

922
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,580
and you hold the pads for him,
how much fucking hurts?

923
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,080
That shit hurts.
Imagine it hitting the outside Midi soft

924
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:42,790
part of your arm with no pads.
You know a guy like Peter efforts.

925
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,190
Now one of those you're going to take,
you're going to take three,

926
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,420
you're going to take four and then 
you're gonna want to cry for a month and

927
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,230
your whole body is going to be all 
fucked up.

928
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,600
You just can't take those.

929
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,660
It's not a sport where you can say,
I'm going to train really hard and be 

930
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:56,660
okay tomorrow.
No,

931
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,080
you don't.
You just have to extend.

932
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,650
I've done it in Holland and in Thailand 
and was like,

933
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:04,010
it sucked.
You just have to know that this is what 

934
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,010
I'm going to go through.

935
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,010
Jerome Le Banner,
one of the greatest of all time,

936
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,780
number one,
a k one championship,

937
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:10,781
but he was on his way and Nesto who's 
banner was winning the fight and the 

938
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,280
nested who's kept kicking his fucking 
arm,

939
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,460
just kicked him in the arm to his arm 
broke and then you see the banner go 

940
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,910
down and tried to get back up and try to
get back into.

941
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,400
Then who's kicked him right in the same 
fucking spot again.

942
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:24,020
Like bitch,
sorry,

943
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:29,110
slammed right into that broken arm.
He lost a fight from broken arm at the 

944
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,850
highest level of the game.
So that's,

945
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,790
you have to always be worried about 
taking those shots.

946
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,400
Your power kicker.
In terms of MMA,

947
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:42,490
the mentality is you can go through a 
wrestling tournament and probably be 

948
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,080
okay at the end if someone said,
hey Joe Rogan and Jimmy Smith,

949
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,640
you guys are going to grapple each other
for an hour.

950
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,660
We can do it.
Yeah,

951
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:48,690
we can do it.
Fine.

952
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,120
You know what I'm in shape or not.
Yeah.

953
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:51,920
We're not in shape and do it anyway.
Yeah,

954
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:56,921
you can take breaks.
You have to survive more time for an 

955
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:56,921
hour.
No.

956
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:57,560
Yeah.
Is Hell.

957
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:02,561
And it's that mentality of you have to 
learn to get through that kind of shit 

958
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,470
to be a good mixed martial artists and a
lot of guys can't do it.

959
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,830
And that's the stopping point for a lot 
of guys and the elbows are just starting

960
00:42:06,831 --> 00:42:10,490
to make their way over the really good 
elbow specialist.

961
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,830
So just start like Anderson has always 
been a master.

962
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,360
Yeah.
Especially in the clench.

963
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,540
He's a master,
the dirty boxing elbow like he,

964
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,730
he'll,
he'll pull you aside with one hand.

965
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:24,870
Anderson is so surprisingly physically 
strong and we saw that in like the rich 

966
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,490
Franklin fight,
which frankly is a fucking stud,

967
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,710
you know,
and an Anderson got that plum on them.

968
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,890
It just started manipulating its neck 
and driving those knees and you're like,

969
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,670
he's fucking strong and the technique is
perfect.

970
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:39,671
His positioning of you is perfect every 
time he knows what he's doing and he 

971
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:40,680
would,
he would land like a lot.

972
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,690
I'm only techniques,
but as far as like the high end 

973
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:45,690
athletes,
you know,

974
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,450
they all I'm sure capable of throwing 
it,

975
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:50,160
but who's been super successful with 
standing elbows,

976
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,210
it's only like a few guys did with the 
Waza was good back in the day.

977
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,630
Especially on like it was known for 
that.

978
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,230
Yeah,
he would slice part.

979
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:58,970
Yeah.
Yeah,

980
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:00,860
he was,
he would let them fly.

981
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,730
He would have like these fucking really 
wide elbows when he would come in.

982
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:09,731
I mean he was throwing torque into that.
He did a lot of spinning techniques to 

983
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:11,090
that famous knock out of Charles 
McCarthy with a spinning back kick.

984
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,210
He was one of the first.
Louisa was one of the first guys to drop

985
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:17,030
a guy with a spinning back kick.
That's way before,

986
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:18,140
you know,
Dennis seaver.

987
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,000
He's become like sort of the specialists
for it,

988
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:21,610
you know,
it's uh,

989
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,820
it's,
it's interesting to have seen that man 

990
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,700
seeing that this sort of interesting 
progression of techniques and they're 

991
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:34,310
like,
just fact that front kicks to the face 

992
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:34,310
of just started knocking people out in 
like,

993
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,110
was it 2011 the need to be tore out?
I was like,

994
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:38,960
how did it make it to 2011?
That's doesn't even make,

995
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,300
it's such a good technique.
They're almost,

996
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,130
you know,
the pendulum swings around and mma,

997
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:45,170
it always has an.
And a lot of those,

998
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,250
if you want to say traditional martial 
arts techniques we didn't see for awhile

999
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:54,430
are starting to make a comeback in mma 
partly because of Anderson Silva and 

1000
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:54,430
stuff like that.

1001
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:54,800
You know what I mean?
He's making them.

1002
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,890
He was saying how it can be effective in
small doses.

1003
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,660
Yeah,
have it in your back pocket for when you

1004
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:00,950
need it.
It's real effective.

1005
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:06,010
Well,
the whole key is they only work if you 

1006
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,291
have all the other stuff.
The problem is most of the like 

1007
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:08,990
taekwondo guys,
they don't have all the other stuff.

1008
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:13,991
They don't have.
They don't know what leg kicks are or 

1009
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:13,991
they don't get.
They're not used to them.

1010
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:15,050
They don't know how to sprawl.
They don't know how to grapple.

1011
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,610
So those techniques are never going to 
work.

1012
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:21,611
You're not going to get them off,
so because God is going to grab you and 

1013
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:22,040
he's going to take you down.
But if you know all the other shit,

1014
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,540
you know how to sprawl.
Oh Yay.

1015
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:24,710
I wrestled in college.
Oh,

1016
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:27,110
okay.
Do you know submission defense?

1017
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,460
Yeah,
I'm a black belt in Jujitsu.

1018
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,470
Oh,
okay.

1019
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,070
And then you go,
okay.

1020
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:35,010
Well how long you been doing taekwondo?
I started when I was a little kid.

1021
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:36,630
I was like five years old.
And you know,

1022
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,990
you talk about a guy who fought or like 
karate style and then learn Jujitsu.

1023
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:45,290
Those guys are going to have like this 
weird advantage because they have this 

1024
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,030
dexterity know that the average person 
just doesn't possess like a guy like Leo

1025
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:53,030
Machida can kick you in the face in a 
way that the average person just can't 

1026
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,030
do it because he's been doing karate his
whole life.

1027
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,950
Like Anderson too.
Like he had a taekwondo background first

1028
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,260
and then learned,
you know?

1029
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,240
Yeah.
So he,

1030
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:04,390
he has this dexterity with his body,
like he can do shit comfortable from 

1031
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:04,920
both sentences,
which is taekwondo thing.

1032
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Yeah.
Because you're going to allocate like 

1033
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:09,960
what you were saying before about 
allocating time to training,

1034
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,040
you're probably not going to put a lot 
of time on the wheel kick.

1035
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,380
You're about to have a fight.
Yeah.

1036
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,450
Yeah.
You have to learn that shit sort of as a

1037
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:19,590
child or as a straight taekwondo or 
karate competitor first,

1038
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,770
because the only way to really pull that
off is if a guy's not kicking your leg 

1039
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,880
or if a guy you know is not going to 
shoot it and then take you down.

1040
00:45:26,881 --> 00:45:28,920
Like for you to get good at that.
When you're a white belt,

1041
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,710
you're going to try and it's gonna be 
way easier for people to take you down.

1042
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:32,250
Yeah.
You know,

1043
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:37,260
it's like,
it's way easier for them to take you 

1044
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,411
down and it's for you to land this 
outlandish move where you're twisting 

1045
00:45:39,411 --> 00:45:40,980
your body around like a fucking 
ballerina and they're going to drop it.

1046
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:42,480
You're gonna that's gonna.
You gonna throw it away,

1047
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,840
but if you start out in taekwondo and 
develop those techniques,

1048
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:50,841
when that's what everybody's doing,
then you have them and then you can 

1049
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:51,720
learn the other things as well.
It's kind of,

1050
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,190
it's kind of ironic that that's like a 
big sport for little kids like taekwondo

1051
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:56,790
is,
but I think it's okay.

1052
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,780
Good one.
It is a good one for this.

1053
00:45:58,930 --> 00:45:59,610
I think so.
You know,

1054
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,620
it's like MMA is basically a scaled down
version of these different styles of 

1055
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,880
wrestling.
You see millie different throws outside 

1056
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,101
ankle picks and stuff.
You just don't see an MMA because 

1057
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,261
they're not in that kind of range,
but they have those things and 

1058
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:13,261
occasionally with good guy you see it.
Yeah.

1059
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:13,820
Wow.
Well,

1060
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,830
it's,
it's always fascinating to me when a 

1061
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:19,420
really good wrestler gets in there and 
you see guys who,

1062
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:21,760
you know,
generally exhibit fairly decent takedown

1063
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:24,190
defense,
just get fucked up over and over again,

1064
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,650
like,
like junior versus Cain in the rematch.

1065
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:26,950
Right.

1066
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,550
Who was the perfect example?
So Juniors takedown defense was the best

1067
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:35,551
in the business.
He had been on his back for 13 seconds 

1068
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:38,410
in his entire fucking UFC career and he 
was the heavyweight champion.

1069
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,080
I mean,
that's some ridiculous tap danced around

1070
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,610
that.
But then people say,

1071
00:46:42,611 --> 00:46:43,840
well,
who did you fight?

1072
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:48,841
That was a really good wrestler.
And you stop and you think about it and 

1073
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:48,841
go,
Shane,

1074
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:50,770
Shane car.
When Olivia this wrestling thing,

1075
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:53,680
this kid gets down and the fucking 
lights land on him,

1076
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:54,990
man,

1077
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,570
that is just awful.
Yeah,

1078
00:46:58,571 --> 00:47:01,570
that's crazy.
And you're in parterre positions.

1079
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:04,490
You're like thinking about what you're 
going to do and then sucks.

1080
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,080
How heavy is that light to that fucking 
had to really hurt.

1081
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:13,250
All right,
don't play it over at Madison Square 

1082
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:13,250
Garden.
Epic Fail on Youtube.

1083
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:17,600
Oh Wow.
Everybody looked at that because it's 

1084
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:17,600
horrible.
Yeah,

1085
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,281
that's fucked up.
But I think I'm listening hoodie takes 

1086
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:20,590
on that.
Had that kind of take down.

1087
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,660
Nobody,
Shane.

1088
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:27,661
But Shane,
I know for a fact came into that fight 

1089
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:30,661
injured Janet.
Janie had been having a lot of back and 

1090
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:30,661
neck.
Yeah.

1091
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:30,661
And

1092
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:34,030
he came into that fight after he had 
gotten off of surgery.

1093
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,520
I think.
Yes,

1094
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,550
some sort of crazy spine surgery or 
something like that.

1095
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:41,551
I don't remember exactly what it was,
but I know he didn't have much time to 

1096
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:44,491
train.
I know he didn't have much time to do 

1097
00:47:44,491 --> 00:47:44,491
any sparring,
you know,

1098
00:47:44,491 --> 00:47:44,491
just he's been,
uh,

1099
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,910
he's dealing with some football injuries
from way back when.

1100
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:54,090
And it's hard for that dude to get 
through a solid camp without getting 

1101
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:54,090
hurt.
But he,

1102
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,840
um,
like if you go back to like when I think

1103
00:47:55,841 --> 00:48:00,841
his best performance was Frank Mir,
that was the scariest Shane Carlin 

1104
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:01,090
performance.
He just murdered Frank Mir.

1105
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:03,380
He got ahold of just mugged him.
He,

1106
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,290
he had,
he had them.

1107
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,120
He had them ran out of gas.
Yeah.

1108
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:08,980
Well he fucked up.
You didn't breathe.

1109
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:10,900
He was like throwing punches and not 
breathing.

1110
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:15,901
And then he just had nothing left.
It's too bad because if he had just 

1111
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:20,161
learned how to relax and pick his shots,
he might've been able to stop them in 

1112
00:48:20,161 --> 00:48:20,161
the first round,
first of all.

1113
00:48:20,161 --> 00:48:21,790
And he definitely wouldn't have gassed 
out like he did.

1114
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:22,960
It was,
I don't know,

1115
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:27,961
it's a to visit adrenaline to.
You're fighting for the title and you 

1116
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:31,890
just get this mad adrenaline dump and 
then you realize the god is still there 

1117
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:32,380
and you're like,
Jesus Christ,

1118
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,560
I might actually have to go through 
three more fucking around for more 

1119
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:37,560
rounds of this.

1120
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:37,560
Nobody listened to.
Man.

1121
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,050
I'm serious.
If you are a,

1122
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:43,110
an aspiring fighter,
if I have one piece of advice to give 

1123
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,110
you based on what Joe here right now,
never ever set a pace.

1124
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:46,240
You can't keep up.
Don't throw.

1125
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:51,241
If you have,
you have x number of punches and around 

1126
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:51,241
or you have x number of punches in a 
fight.

1127
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:55,500
If it's $300,
don't feel 300 punches in the first 

1128
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:55,500
round.
I see guys who was ultimately set a pace

1129
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,040
and you will look.
You can't keep this up,

1130
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,600
but you're hoping the other guy will 
hopefully the other guy wants,

1131
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,850
which is never a solid bet

1132
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,430
ever.
It's not intelligent.

1133
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,790
It's not an intelligent way to approach.
It can be successful occasionally.

1134
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,210
For a guy like vandelay Silva could be 
successful for fucking ever.

1135
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:14,211
You know,
it was successful because he was so 

1136
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:15,831
murderous in his approach.
They just freak people out and then he 

1137
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:16,130
would stomp them and destroy them and 
then people figured out,

1138
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,520
wait,
I can throw a left hook in the middle of

1139
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,190
this will drop your ass.
Which happened.

1140
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:24,000
Cro Cop really sort of exposed that.
The difference between a real high level

1141
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:27,570
striker and a guy was wild murderers 
brawler angled off into,

1142
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,580
but vandelays stills one of my favorites
of all time.

1143
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,540
His fights were the most exciting.
Nobody was fight like if you were going 

1144
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,981
to go see a vandelay Silva fight.
That shit was an event with vandelay 

1145
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:38,981
fought soccer.
Abiola go,

1146
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:39,480
whoa,
Jesus.

1147
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,640
Looking at him across the corners,
doing this shit was collarbone.

1148
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,660
We broke his collarbone three inches,
my my favorite and one was that 

1149
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:49,200
knockout.
The fade away.

1150
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:51,570
Punch that he landed as he was stepping 
forward.

1151
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,870
And the sock Robert just flew backwards.
Man.

1152
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:55,680
He is first.
I would.

1153
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:56,760
Dan Henderson.
Yeah.

1154
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,420
He put down through the floor.
Fifteen minutes.

1155
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,320
It was a tough fight and his face was 
all fucked up to it.

1156
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:06,360
You only had one eye.
He could not see a lot of his left eye.

1157
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:11,490
And if you want it to look at swollen I 
Anderson or a vandelay Silva maybe.

1158
00:50:11,971 --> 00:50:14,560
You know the Google image sent?
Yeah.

1159
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,650
Off the first.
Dan Henderson fight was one of the worst

1160
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,010
cuts and swollen eyes I've ever seen a 
guy keep fighting with.

1161
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,630
Yeah.
It was fucking nasty.

1162
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,630
You know,
Dan had him hurt too bad.

1163
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,010
Took them down and then the got up.
Well Dan took

1164
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,310
that fight on short notice those,
the thing about trading with Dan at that

1165
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:32,000
time.
What are you really,

1166
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:37,190
you know,
I was at team punishment at Huntington 

1167
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,450
beach and Dan,
I don't know if he lived there at the 

1168
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,951
time or lived near there.
Him and randy couture come in there all 

1169
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:41,951
the time and that was one of the fights 
that I,

1170
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:41,951
I,
uh,

1171
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:42,720
I,
uh,

1172
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,400
was training with him for.
Dan has always had that retarded power,

1173
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,840
just ridiculous.
And his strength.

1174
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:49,980
We grappled with room.
Oh yeah,

1175
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:50,310
yeah,
yeah.

1176
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,640
Was grappled with a fire hydrant.
He's a man.

1177
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:54,740
He's made of wood.
It's ridiculous.

1178
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:57,130
It's ridiculous that I grabbed a once in
a.

1179
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,930
I actually had a cold.
It sucked,

1180
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,990
but he,
he mauled me.

1181
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,890
He got me a leg lock or something like 
that maybe.

1182
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,250
And maybe it got me in a head and arm 
choke or something like that.

1183
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,090
But he was a,
he's like a dense dude dude.

1184
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,030
Like he's like dense,
like a hold on.

1185
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:12,220
Don't be like,
oh fuck,

1186
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,900
it's got that grapplers bill,
you know,

1187
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,600
there's a lot of dudes out there that 
you don't realize how you can look at 

1188
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,690
them and they develop this like freak 
grapplers strength.

1189
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,380
Yeah.
You know,

1190
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:25,970
from just years and years and years of 
throwing bodies around what Dan has done

1191
00:51:25,971 --> 00:51:28,640
that a lot of people don't as he's 
adapted that to striking.

1192
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,710
You can't turn that into a knockout 
power.

1193
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
In fact,
it's hard because they're used to being 

1194
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,050
such varied as they can't get that snap 
in there punches.

1195
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:40,910
Dan has somehow translated that grappler
body into a knockout punch,

1196
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,370
which a lot of guys can't do.
Yeah,

1197
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,400
and typically it wasn't the Greco guys 
that would get like really good at 

1198
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,350
striking either.
Right now I'm just more of the freestyle

1199
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,500
guys because the freestyle guys could 
shoot and when you're.

1200
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,860
When you develop that sort of ability to
explode in a double leg,

1201
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,500
that shit.
Same Shit can come with a punch.

1202
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,430
Like Kevin random is a perfect example.
He had the retard,

1203
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:05,030
just unbelievably fast powered devil and
Kevin randleman his prime.

1204
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,420
He was a steamroller.
He would just freight train your ass.

1205
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:12,530
I mean he was and he,
he could jump over your body like he,

1206
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:14,900
he.
So he was so ridiculously athletic.

1207
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,790
He could jump over your fucking body,
you know,

1208
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,630
and random.
And when he would land a punch,

1209
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,330
he could land a punch the same way.
He could land that double.

1210
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,940
He would explode on you before you even 
know it was common.

1211
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:28,580
And you can crack you and tag you.
And that's what he did to cro.

1212
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:29,510
Cop,
he knocked out Cro,

1213
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:31,730
cop.
That was like a crazy surprise.

1214
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Then you know,
it wasn't a surprise that he had one 

1215
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,000
you,
if you took them down and you know,

1216
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,600
mold them on the ground,
knocked about the fact that he knocked 

1217
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:40,600
them out with like,
I think it was a left hook.

1218
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,760
Just ridiculous speed.
And that coming from that,

1219
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,740
you know,
that use of that wrestling background.

1220
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,920
But it's a weird thing to transition 
from a sport where you don't ever get 

1221
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,221
hit to transition from a sport where you
very might likely get knocked 

1222
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:54,980
unconscious.
At least in practice.

1223
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,710
It's very likely one day you're going to
get unconscious wrestlers.

1224
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:01,410
What they bring generally to mma is 
they're incredibly hard workers.

1225
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,160
It's just.
And I wrestled in high school and it was

1226
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:09,161
just,
it's incredibly difficult to training 

1227
00:53:09,161 --> 00:53:09,970
and they compete a lot.
It can be a lot,

1228
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,780
lot of tournaments,
you know,

1229
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:14,540
a,
a wrestler in the NCAAS by like 40,

1230
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:19,570
40 matches in a year.
They reached out to because of the 

1231
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,140
fucking weight cutting.
They're just used to companion that used

1232
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,330
to cut and wait.
There used to be a miserable,

1233
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,960
miserable and hungry and all the time.

1234
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:31,110
So it's not a big deal.
The problem they have is they have to 

1235
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,300
adjust to getting hit and you know,
there are certain wrestlers that,

1236
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:37,301
that,
that never make that successful mental 

1237
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:37,301
leap.
There's also an issue with

1238
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:40,560
overtraining and that's a real issue 
with wrestlers and you know,

1239
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:45,590
it's like this whole willingness to push
it farther than the next man and the 

1240
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,210
pain is just weakness.
Leaving your body.

1241
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:51,830
That's all well and good,
but the reality is you should probably 

1242
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:52,530
be paying attention to your heart rate.
You should probably know.

1243
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:54,570
Is it up five beats today from 
yesterday?

1244
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:54,880
Yeah.
Well,

1245
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:56,270
you're overtraining.
Do you want.

1246
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,600
Why don't you piss in a cup?
Oh,

1247
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,380
you're dehydrated.
It.

1248
00:53:58,381 --> 00:53:59,340
Look what's going on here,
dude.

1249
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,950
You don't have minerals in your body.
Know,

1250
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,050
like the wrestling mentality is like,
shut up pussy,

1251
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:09,290
get up,
put on your fucking converse all stars 

1252
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:09,290
or run up hill to get in there,
get in there and that,

1253
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,240
that's good and it's bad.
It's good if you're,

1254
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:12,850
you're,
you know,

1255
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:17,870
you're super honest about what's going 
on but bad if you know you're not and 

1256
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:19,400
you don't pay attention to signs of over

1257
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,250
our wold in wrestling before mma,
when resident is wrestling,

1258
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,520
how old did people wrestle?
You didn't get out of your mid twenties 

1259
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,270
generally speaking,
so you can have that mentality because 

1260
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:33,270
you only did it.
You 25 problems.

1261
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,530
You take that to mma where you could do 
it until your mid thirties.

1262
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,680
Randy couture to 40.
You can't maintain that.

1263
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,710
How about Hopkins man?
Oh my God.

1264
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,630
How to explain that?
You know what it is.

1265
00:54:43,631 --> 00:54:45,630
You know what it is.
I'm going to tell you why I'm gonna.

1266
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,820
Tell you why the dude is tech.
I've never seen him get hurt.

1267
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,480
I've seen,
I don't know how many Bernard Hopkins 

1268
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:54,480
fight since way back in the day.
His first fight with Roy Jones.

1269
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,280
Okay.
The guy doesn't get is technically so 

1270
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,280
good that he hasn't gone through the 
things physically.

1271
00:55:00,281 --> 00:55:01,780
A lot of fighters have gone through.
He hasn't.

1272
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,160
Did Chad Dawson drop him?

1273
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,940
I don't think Chad doesn't ever dry.
I didn't see the fight.

1274
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:08,110
I don't think ever dropped him unless 
I'm mistaken.

1275
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,290
I don't think that number's dropped him 
off at work though.

1276
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,760
I mean it's easy to do when you're 45 
and it is what it said.

1277
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,480
There's 48 dudes.
She's 48.

1278
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,050
Then this fighting soon.
I think he's fighting in March.

1279
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,340
There's something I want to talk to you 
about.

1280
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:22,490
I want to ask you.
Okay.

1281
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,280
As a commentator,
because we.

1282
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,280
We interview thousands of fighters.
Thousand.

1283
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:32,560
Yeah.
There's something called the heartmath,

1284
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,410
which is in interviews.
We asked a fighter,

1285
00:55:35,411 --> 00:55:37,180
you know,
I've had fighters cry.

1286
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,100
They wanted something so badly.
I want this so bad.

1287
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,280
They literally cry.
They literally break down in front of 

1288
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:44,280
us.
They go in there,

1289
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,780
they take on a guy who's just better 
than they are and they lose.

1290
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:52,020
Yep.
I was at Ego Wagner Jujitsu down in 

1291
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,020
Missouri.

1292
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,020
I was picking up a car and I just like,
hey,

1293
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,381
how do we go values here?
And I was doing some Jujitsu with them 

1294
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:56,381
and all these guys are going to go,
what?

1295
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:59,660
What?
What would you tell a guy getting ready 

1296
00:55:59,660 --> 00:55:59,660
for mma?
And I go,

1297
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,060
be technically sound,
will listen to your coaches and make 

1298
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,361
sure you have all the tools to win.
And they all kind of sat and they were 

1299
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:06,361
quiet for a second.
I went,

1300
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:06,640
I thought you'd give some speech about 
heart.

1301
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:12,300
And I know I've seen guys with a heart 
without technique makes a beating more 

1302
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,340
interesting because the guy is still 
getting up when he's getting tattooed.

1303
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:16,420
Absolutely.
And I go,

1304
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:21,421
if you weren't technically sound like 
Bernard Hopkins probably beat a lot of 

1305
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,120
guys with my heart that he had floyd 
mayweather weeds.

1306
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,430
A lot of guys with more heart than they 
have because they are technically sound.

1307
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,930
They're really sounded.
Yeah.

1308
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:28,780
Heart's important.
And what?

1309
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,660
You can't overstate the importance of 
heart.

1310
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,370
But guys who go,
yeah,

1311
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:33,180
I'm tough.
I got heart.

1312
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,440
I go,
yeah,

1313
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:35,790
that can make a beating a lot more than 
you need.

1314
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:37,050
You don't have the technique to go with 
it.

1315
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,450
And it brought.
Hopkins is a great example of that,

1316
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:42,130
of a guy who is just technically really,
really sound.

1317
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:44,400
It had a long,
great career because of it.

1318
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:45,210
You know?
I mean,

1319
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:50,211
people think that somehow my heart's 
going to overcome a guy who put in more 

1320
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:50,760
work and it's more tech than I am and it
it.

1321
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,940
It rarely works.
It works often enough that it's 

1322
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,940
developed this myth of that that you 
cannot work these guys and you know,

1323
00:56:56,941 --> 00:56:59,220
if he's in shaping as good technique,
that is really,

1324
00:56:59,221 --> 00:57:04,221
really hard to do and it's something 
I've noticed over and over again and 

1325
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:04,221
fighting the guy can be motivated as 
shit.

1326
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:06,820
If you didn't have the technique and you
didn't put in work,

1327
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:07,860
it is not going to help you.

1328
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,930
Yeah,
it'll happen.

1329
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,060
I'm now and then if you catch a guy 
who's out of shape or a guy who's got it

1330
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,820
and weakness in his game,
like a striking weakness in his game,

1331
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:19,821
maybe he's,
maybe he's more technical and grappling 

1332
00:57:19,821 --> 00:57:19,821
and you have more heart,
you'd take it to them,

1333
00:57:19,821 --> 00:57:21,000
but a guy was technically sound across 
the board.

1334
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:21,990
You're absolutely right.

1335
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,340
It can expose the other guys.
Lack of preparedness.

1336
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:29,370
That's what heart does.
It exposes the other guys lack of 

1337
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:29,370
preparedness because you know the first 
one,

1338
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:29,980
shogun forest,
the first shogun.

1339
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:32,650
Forrest Shogun was not prepared for that
fight,

1340
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,790
he just wasn't physically prepared.
And what happened in the rematch showing

1341
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:41,791
was prepared and blasted for it.
So that's probably the biggest heart in 

1342
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:41,791
the whole game,
you know what I mean?

1343
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,700
It's,
it's one of those things where I think a

1344
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:44,530
lot of people,
and you know,

1345
00:57:44,531 --> 00:57:49,531
it's a great story.
This guy with this big heart defeated 

1346
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:49,531
this guy and I said,
hey look,

1347
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:49,531
guys,
be technically sound

1348
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:54,180
first before anything else.
I think you're dealing with two 

1349
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,420
different us too.
There's a difference of several fights 

1350
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,130
and fights,
forest fires sites,

1351
00:57:59,131 --> 00:58:04,131
you know,
forrest is known for having the most 

1352
00:58:04,131 --> 00:58:04,540
exciting fights in the UFC history.
The most important,

1353
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:08,320
exciting fight in the history of the UFC
was Stephan Bonner and forrest griffin,

1354
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:11,050
the files of the ultimate fighter 
because we're folks who haven't seen it.

1355
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:16,260
It's a real classic.
I watched it again recently because it 

1356
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:16,260
was just a,
I don't know what I was dealing,

1357
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:16,260
but uh,
I,

1358
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,280
I,
I've saw was,

1359
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:22,580
you know,
I have a bunch of them dvr and I've 

1360
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:22,580
watched that fight and I was like,
wow,

1361
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,430
what a.
It was at the time it was so crazy,

1362
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:26,020
like we knew it was going to be a good 
fight,

1363
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:28,510
but when they got on there and they just
went off,

1364
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:30,090
that was,
it was just chaos.

1365
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,250
There were so evenly matched.
They had trained together for so long.

1366
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:38,251
They knew what the fuck each other did 
and they just went after each other for 

1367
00:58:38,251 --> 00:58:40,890
three glorious rounds.
Maybe made him in that modern man.

1368
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,790
He can't do that forever,
you know,

1369
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:47,791
that's not the smartest way to fight.
The smartest way to fight is to be 

1370
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:50,371
technical and to choose your spots.
And although I appreciate for sure from 

1371
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:53,880
a point of view of like a spectator who 
loves to say,

1372
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,310
you know,
I,

1373
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,000
I appreciate the fuck out of the fact 
that they did it,

1374
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,620
you know,
and it was great to watch.

1375
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,490
Well pay to watch that guy anytime,
anytime,

1376
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,430
anytime.
Yeah.

1377
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:09,700
Chris leave and is always going to be a.
But I think Chris is a not the right 

1378
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,710
example anymore because he's got a lot 
more technical over.

1379
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:14,860
Like especially if you go back to like 
the Erin Simpson fight.

1380
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,950
He fought very smart in that fight,
you know,

1381
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:20,290
his last fight wasn't as best fight the 
Derek Brunson fine,

1382
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,830
but you know,
he's got,

1383
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,200
you know,
just he had a,

1384
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,300
he had at least a year off,
you know,

1385
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,560
and he had substance issues and a bunch 
of other shit going on,

1386
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:35,561
so I dunno.
But Chris liebing is always one of the 

1387
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:37,430
most exciting guys.
He's one of those guys that he might not

1388
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:42,431
ever be the champion.
You might not ever be able to beat 

1389
00:59:42,431 --> 00:59:42,860
Anderson Silva.
I will pay to see that guy fight any day

1390
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,820
of the week.
Anytime.

1391
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:45,040
You'll know,
whatever.

1392
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:45,800
Everybody forgets,
you know,

1393
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:50,810
and you know,
we deal with a lot of people that don't 

1394
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:50,810
understand the nature of the business.
We're in the entertainment business,

1395
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,860
sports where you are in the 
entertainment business and fighters like

1396
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,660
forrest griffin and I was like Chris 
leaving and the,

1397
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:57,210
the,
you know,

1398
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:02,460
you know Michael Chandler for us,
the guys that go in there and just put 

1399
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,020
it on the dude and I was just a fireball
from beginning to end.

1400
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,450
That's what,
that's what people tune in for.

1401
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,680
The handler guy is very exciting man.
Beast.

1402
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:11,930
He goes off.
I did not expect that at all.

1403
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,780
He's an intention and being like,
you see when he's talking,

1404
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,430
you know he's got.
He's got a lot going on behind the eyes.

1405
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,310
You're just getting started.
That's the scary part.

1406
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,990
Yeah,
I think so.

1407
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:24,020
You know,
I was super impressed with him and Eddie

1408
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,580
Alvarez fight.
That was,

1409
01:00:24,581 --> 01:00:26,540
I was sick.
Incredible.

1410
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,190
She's done it.
Then the third round,

1411
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,230
did you really?
I was like,

1412
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,240
because that third round Eddie starts 10
off channel,

1413
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:33,560
looked at a gas.
I was like,

1414
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:35,960
okay,
this is probably great performance.

1415
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:40,961
This is probably it.
He came out and round for like it was 

1416
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:40,961
shot out of a cannon.
Eddie just was not ready for it.

1417
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:42,590
He's a bad motherfucker.
Bad Dude.

1418
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,760
There's so few of those guys that like 
have this special thing about them and 

1419
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:53,501
you see them come up and you go with 
this guy just for whatever reason he 

1420
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:53,501
just stands out.

1421
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:56,470
Like what percentage of it is it?
Is it,

1422
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,580
is it one percent of all the fighters?
I mean,

1423
01:00:58,581 --> 01:00:59,300
what,
what is it,

1424
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,610
what percentage that you see when you 
see a guy,

1425
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:06,611
Nico,
this something that this dude has that 

1426
01:01:06,611 --> 01:01:06,611
other people just don't?
Five percent.

1427
01:01:06,611 --> 01:01:07,870
Yeah.
I would go as high as 55 percent use.

1428
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,150
You and I have seen where even if it's 
even just getting started,

1429
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,130
you're like keeping it on that day.
Yeah,

1430
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:16,070
because that dude's got it.
First Time I suggest put Carl prison.

1431
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,210
I went,
alright,

1432
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,420
this dude is going to be a problem.
I always have every sps,

1433
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:23,150
early fights and I was there when he 
fought a jay her on.

1434
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,140
That's when I knew.
I was like,

1435
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:26,030
wow,
this guy's fucking savage.

1436
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,090
Savage.
But the first one that I knew,

1437
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:34,091
he was good.
The one that really turned my head when 

1438
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:34,091
he damali frank trigg.

1439
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:35,570
Yeah.
He demolished frank trigg.

1440
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:36,460
You went.
He wrote,

1441
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:41,470
okay.
Because trick at the time was a top 

1442
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,511
contender.
Only lost to Matt Hughes and soccer and 

1443
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:45,050
it was like he just balled him.
He ran through them.

1444
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,680
He just put up a page that frank trigg,
especially when it got to the ground of.

1445
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,510
Oh,
it's just manhandled them.

1446
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,760
Yeah.
I think it was like really shocked.

1447
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Yeah.
I don't remember when he got off of a 

1448
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:57,960
trick said,
you're really fucking good man.

1449
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,790
You're really fucking good.
He was just shocked.

1450
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,130
Yeah.
There's a few of those guys,

1451
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:04,430
like when Anderson first came into the 
octagon and we fought Chris leaving,

1452
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:09,670
I knew I had seen him fight many times.
I'd seen his difference between his 

1453
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:12,760
pride days where he was still learning 
submissions and is more time,

1454
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:17,090
wasn't exact word was then to the cage 
rage days.

1455
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,510
When you went over to England,
there's a cage rage

1456
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,100
in cage rage.
When he fought Lee Murray and he fought.

1457
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,420
Tony frequently hit him with that upward
elbow was a stepping forward,

1458
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,440
upward,
elegant.

1459
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:29,360
Missed.
He's like,

1460
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:34,370
you pretend to miss the hook,
and then we loaded him with blam and 

1461
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:37,941
caught him on the Chin and knocked and 
completely unconscious and I knew that 

1462
01:02:37,941 --> 01:02:40,470
Anderson was something special.
I knew he was coming into his own,

1463
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,990
especially the Lee Marie fight because 
Lee Mary,

1464
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:48,140
who went on to be one of the most 
notorious criminals in UK history and 

1465
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:48,580
get a movie about it.
Of course,

1466
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,000
you know,
from what I've heard MMA fighter turned,

1467
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:55,380
uh,
he was alleging is Tyson because,

1468
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:55,780
well,
he,

1469
01:02:55,790 --> 01:03:00,790
he was history at the time.
Apparently the story goes that he met 

1470
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,580
Tito Ortiz in London back when Tito was 
the champ.

1471
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,790
And uh,
he uh,

1472
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:09,740
either didn't know Tito was or didn't 
give a fuck who tito was and they got an

1473
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:10,410
a street fight.

1474
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,490
And the word is that Lee Marie one,
the street fight.

1475
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,740
That was what everybody had said.
And then,

1476
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:17,540
you know,
I mean,

1477
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:22,640
even after Tito,
last to chuck in the post fight 

1478
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,371
interview,
who was talking about how there's 185 

1479
01:03:25,371 --> 01:03:25,800
pounders running his mouth.
Shoot,

1480
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:31,080
it was,
this is after he just thought chocolate 

1481
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:31,080
down and got stopped.
He was calling out Leanne Marie.

1482
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,050
So it was a legit chief.
Something happened for sure.

1483
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,020
And then he went from there to,
uh,

1484
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:42,080
getting somehow or another involved in 
this insane armed robbery,

1485
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:47,940
like right out of state the movie where 
they have masks on and machine guns.

1486
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:51,910
And they held hostages and they stole 
millions and millions of dollars.

1487
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,850
And then one of the biggest heist in 
British history,

1488
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:59,130
and then he went to Morocco and then in 
Morocco he got arrested for,

1489
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:01,590
I think it was like cocaine and 
kidnapping.

1490
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,600
Ridiculous.
Like how many years can I add onto my 

1491
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:07,600
sentence here?

1492
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:07,600
Let me see.
Let's take a look at it here.

1493
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,280
You would think.
Okay,

1494
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:12,570
I'm on the run from the biggest armed 
robbery in the UK history.

1495
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:15,870
I got this fat bag of money with me.
What do I come out?

1496
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,720
I never understand.
And there's a great dark cooking 

1497
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:21,720
cowboys.
Ever seen it?

1498
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,740
Great documentary.
Corbin Corbin,

1499
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,930
I met that guy in,
uh,

1500
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,020
in,
in Florida.

1501
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:30,021
Great Guy.
One thing I kept thinking as I was 

1502
01:04:30,021 --> 01:04:30,021
watching that movie,
and by the way listeners,

1503
01:04:30,021 --> 01:04:30,021
if you haven't seen cookie cowboys was 
great documentary.

1504
01:04:30,021 --> 01:04:30,960
Check it out.
Amazing.

1505
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:33,250
And two,
one into there's two.

1506
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:37,660
And these guys make hundreds of millions
of dollars closer.

1507
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:43,040
At what point do you go out,
done not risking life sentence over 

1508
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,070
this.
I have $50 million.

1509
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:46,380
Can I budget in my head?
Okay.

1510
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:47,280
Yeah,
I can live on this.

1511
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:47,730
Well,
I think,

1512
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,300
I don't think that you could spend the 
money.

1513
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,500
I think they take the money and it 
becomes like they know what the numbers 

1514
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,280
on the money where and then they put 
that in the circulation.

1515
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:04,610
Be alerted to get a legit job and go,
I know I'm going to be a mortician.

1516
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:10,740
We're going to have to be in Morocco to 
not go to prison for the rest of my 

1517
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:10,740
life.
Yeah.

1518
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,240
I would rather be lucky.

1519
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,860
I think he gets like girls in there 
because got a chick pregnant.

1520
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:18,160
He's

1521
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:18,990
hooked up there.
That's why.

1522
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,280
That's why he ran there.
His family's Moroccan.

1523
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:23,760
I guess they got some juice in Morocco 
so I don't.

1524
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:26,530
Maybe he's dealing with like the the 
Pablo Escobar prison in Colombia.

1525
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:28,590
That's like a compound.
I don't let them.

1526
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,630
The idea of supporting criminals.
Neither do I,

1527
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:35,670
but I do like the idea that this a place
you can go where jail's not really jail 

1528
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:40,490
and he could pay some people off and 
just live like they did the rest of the 

1529
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:40,490
world,
Bro.

1530
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:43,480
That is the rest of the world.
I've been all over the place.

1531
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,500
It's the rest of the world,
man.

1532
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:46,040
I don't really think that,
you know,

1533
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:51,060
you should be using it in a bad way.
I don't think corruption should be used 

1534
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,450
in a bad way,
but once he used that way,

1535
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,650
when a guy can get a dope cell because 
he's paying for,

1536
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,930
they can bring in girls.

1537
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,790
I don't really hate it,
you know?

1538
01:05:58,910 --> 01:05:59,480
I mean,
look,

1539
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:04,660
fucking a security guards got to do is 
security guards got a tough way to make 

1540
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:05,520
a living,
isn't it?

1541
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,180
So I don't mind him getting a few extra 
hundred bucks if he brings it hookers.

1542
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:11,520
Really Marie,
I really don't see a problem with that.

1543
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,200
The unions in California,
it's really hilarious.

1544
01:06:13,201 --> 01:06:18,201
Here in California,
the prison guard union is one of most 

1545
01:06:18,201 --> 01:06:19,260
powerful unions in California.
Every time they tried to do any kind of,

1546
01:06:19,261 --> 01:06:24,261
well,
can we search guards before they go in 

1547
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:24,261
there or something because dark guards 
are making huge money,

1548
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,500
get old cell phones and give them to the
prisoners and Melissa,

1549
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:30,480
they can do their thing.
They stop it every single time,

1550
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,860
every single time and because if they 
know they're all corrupt and then all 

1551
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,980
they're all sneaking weed in and that's 
okay.

1552
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,110
The fuck man,
you know,

1553
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:43,260
this needs to be a little room for 
fuckery in this world.

1554
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,930
Everything can be cigarettes.
Twenty bucks.

1555
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:51,280
Let's prison.
He was in a cigarette is 20 bucks a 

1556
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:51,280
cigarette,
one cigarette being a guard and bringing

1557
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,040
in a pack of cigarettes and making that 
kind of money.

1558
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,270
Yeah.
Brian would be worth every penny.

1559
01:06:56,271 --> 01:06:58,240
It would give you that money.
You would,

1560
01:06:58,241 --> 01:06:58,870
wouldn't you?
Right.

1561
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:03,760
Probably just have one Sayer Ji who he'd
be one a day.

1562
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:06,910
What could you deal with like $100 
cigarette habit a week and you deal with

1563
01:07:06,911 --> 01:07:08,800
one cigarette a day or would you just go
crazy?

1564
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:11,620
I probably have like two hits.
Put it out to hits the next day,

1565
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:15,010
put it out so I would make it last like,
I know you're like crazy.

1566
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,080
That's like serious addiction.
How many,

1567
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,430
how many of you smoking a day these days
about a pack?

1568
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:25,000
Are you worried about like when you hear
that our friend Duncan gets cancer,

1569
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,280
you know,
and he's basically your age and then all

1570
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:32,281
of a sudden you know,
he's going through radiation and all 

1571
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:32,281
this shit.
Does that freak you out at all?

1572
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:32,910
I don't put cigarettes at mass or 
anything.

1573
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:37,930
Hey,
what are you trying to say about talking

1574
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:40,210
shit about a fucking person?

1575
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,040
You know what else?
What else is bad that I do?

1576
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,490
You know,
I drank,

1577
01:07:47,491 --> 01:07:50,030
I do drugs,
I smoke whatever.

1578
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:52,040
So you just don't give a fuck about your
meat vehicle.

1579
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:54,080
You're just gonna ride that shit until 
the wheels fall off.

1580
01:07:54,081 --> 01:07:55,400
Is that the idea?
Yeah.

1581
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:57,350
Wow.
I guess,

1582
01:07:57,351 --> 01:08:02,351
yeah,
everybody's got their own decisions to 

1583
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:04,400
making this really hard to be a comedian
and go to a comedy club and not drink.

1584
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:08,030
It's really hard to go to be a comedian 
and go to a comedy club and not smoke.

1585
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,560
It's like almost impossible.
Well,

1586
01:08:11,561 --> 01:08:14,900
it's more fun if you do those things.
That's the problem.

1587
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,280
That's the problem.
You know,

1588
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,500
you're hanging out with comedians and 
you want a drink.

1589
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:19,340
Fuck it.
Let's do it.

1590
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:20,240
Yeah.
You know,

1591
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,570
pulls out a joint yet little known fact.
I've never had a drink in my life.

1592
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,830
Really little known fact.

1593
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:27,440
But my parents are both alcoholics.
Oh,

1594
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,600
dad's real bad.
Real bad.

1595
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:32,850
Good move that man.
I was like,

1596
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,260
I don't need this.
Yeah.

1597
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,350
Just in case.
Just in case we went back off.

1598
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,690
That's a reason why I've never tried 
cocaine.

1599
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:43,691
I,
I get a chance to watch no one in my 

1600
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:45,461
family,
but I have chance to watch some friends 

1601
01:08:45,461 --> 01:08:45,461
lose their fucking shit over it.
It's good.

1602
01:08:45,461 --> 01:08:46,280
Smart to learn.
You know,

1603
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,040
I'm not saying that everybody should 
have an alcoholic in their family,

1604
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:54,041
but you should really held the broad 
spectrums of how bad something can fuck 

1605
01:08:54,771 --> 01:08:55,760
up your life.
You know,

1606
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:57,820
the show intervention on any.
My,

1607
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:00,980
my wife's a producer and she produced 
intervention for like a year and a half.

1608
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:02,120
She was,
she worked for the production unit,

1609
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:05,390
didn't mention the story.
She would tell me about these addicts.

1610
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,730
So.
And it's the what,

1611
01:09:06,731 --> 01:09:11,731
what's weird is the inconsistency of it 
where some adults will do one drug and 

1612
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:12,080
it doesn't really do.

1613
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:12,800
Yeah,
it's okay.

1614
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:13,230
Whatever.
But,

1615
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:18,300
but,
but coke is their thing or why our 

1616
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:22,450
systems,
our brains key into a particular drug 

1617
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:22,860
and go and they can't get off whatever 
it is is,

1618
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:23,510
you know,
it's,

1619
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:24,110
it's,
it's,

1620
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,600
it's really weird how some people are 
hard hardwired for that and other people

1621
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:31,601
aren't.
I don't really have an addictive 

1622
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:31,601
personality.
The only thing I remember,

1623
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:31,601
you know,
I love fighting,

1624
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:35,641
I love training,
but that's more of a reaction that you 

1625
01:09:35,641 --> 01:09:36,200
could call it a physical addiction to 
some,

1626
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,400
to some degree,
but,

1627
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:38,250
you know,
it's,

1628
01:09:38,251 --> 01:09:39,980
it's weird what keys into certain 
people,

1629
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:43,230
how some people get hooked on something 
other people have no problem with it.

1630
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:45,940
There's a lot of genetic variables.
Yeah.

1631
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:47,630
Especially when it comes to.
I mean,

1632
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,760
it's the oldest running,
you know,

1633
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:53,410
story in America really from the dawn of
the,

1634
01:09:53,411 --> 01:09:54,530
uh,
the pilgrim days.

1635
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:57,410
It was the Indians and their inability 
to handle alcohol.

1636
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:02,680
That is the American and native 
Americans have consistently had a 

1637
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,200
problem with alcohol.
And the idea is that genetically they're

1638
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:10,201
bodies are not designed to process it 
because it wasn't a part of their 

1639
01:10:10,201 --> 01:10:11,690
culture until the white man showed up.
So it was this massive Polynesian.

1640
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,240
I grew up in Long Beach.
A lot of samoans.

1641
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,080
Yes.
Yes.

1642
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,420
Last thing you want is a family of drunk
samoans.

1643
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:18,400
Yeah.
You're right after you.

1644
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:19,220
Right.
They love me.

1645
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:21,110
I lost some old friends so I'm cool.
But man,

1646
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,540
they roam in packs with families and 
yeah.

1647
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:25,810
Well I find that generally very friendly
people.

1648
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:29,180
Unbelievably friendly.
Family oriented.

1649
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,850
Yeah.
Just don't be content with you.

1650
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:33,860
Yes.
But uh,

1651
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:34,600
you know,
the,

1652
01:10:34,601 --> 01:10:35,200
the,
uh,

1653
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,740
cultural lack of a history with alcohol 
fucks them up,

1654
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:40,880
man.
It really can.

1655
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:46,150
There's some.
And then there's a cultural history of 

1656
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:46,150
fucking straight alcoholics.

1657
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:46,150
I'm like a lot of Irish folks.
Yeah.

1658
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,780
Yeah.
And my dad was half Irish.

1659
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:48,500
There you go.
Yeah.

1660
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:53,501
I have a good buddy who's a dad,
was Irish and drunk a Greg Fitzsimmons.

1661
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:57,620
He's told the story 100 times and about 
how his dad,

1662
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:01,700
you know,
fucking crashed a car while he was drunk

1663
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:02,740
and then,
you know,

1664
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,760
it was in the hospital for awhile and 
then got out of the hospital and like 

1665
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,390
almost immediately started drinking 
again.

1666
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:09,310
Yeah,
it doesn't,

1667
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:14,320
it doesn't.
Like my dad went through dts while 

1668
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:14,320
driving.
One time my mom said,

1669
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:14,320
well,
he was driving,

1670
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,410
apparently had any drink in the morning,
which is weird.

1671
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:18,190
I don't know what he was thinking,
but anyway,

1672
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,490
but mom said you were in the backseat or
you,

1673
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:22,200
you know,
we were there and he started shaking and

1674
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:27,440
he started shaking any,
pulled the car over and he started 

1675
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:27,440
convulsing and a cop came and said,
do you need help?

1676
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,800
Does he need to go to the emergency 
room?

1677
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,660
Because he was having convulsions.
Gideon drink that morning.

1678
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,320
One day.
One morning,

1679
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:36,600
Bro.
One morning I saw he had a head injury,

1680
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:38,250
which is how he will,
not really how he died,

1681
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:40,110
but he had a head injury and he was in 
the hospital.

1682
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:45,111
One time I went to visit him and they 
had him tied to the bed and he's like 

1683
01:11:45,111 --> 01:11:45,690
thrashing around in.
His eyes are rolling back.

1684
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,150
He's literally in a coma,
but dts we'll go through them anyway.

1685
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:53,180
It doesn't.
Your body's still reacting to the fact 

1686
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,161
that you don't have any alcohol.
So these thrashing around and he's 

1687
01:11:55,161 --> 01:11:55,161
screaming and all this stuff,
and I.

1688
01:11:55,161 --> 01:11:56,430
I'm looking down at him and I forget who
I'm with.

1689
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,230
And they went,
can you believe this?

1690
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,490
I turned them off.
That's why I don't drink.

1691
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,050
You see it,
you wanna take a picture of this because

1692
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:02,520
this is why I don't drink.
She was like,

1693
01:12:02,521 --> 01:12:04,830
yeah,
I can see why you don't drink this.

1694
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,520
Your body will go through dts anyway,
whether you're in a coma or not,

1695
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,800
you know,
so that kind of stuff,

1696
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:11,880
you know.
So it's like,

1697
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,240
what?
I just stay away from what's wrong with 

1698
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:17,240
people.
I don't know.

1699
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:21,620
Design can get hooked on alcohol or 
heroin or something that sucks.

1700
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:24,620
Something that's bad for it and 
something like working out.

1701
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,750
It's been asked for people and they 
don't want to do it.

1702
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:27,980
Well,
you know what,

1703
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:29,120
for some,
for some people,

1704
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,660
uh,
I,

1705
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:35,670
I kinda stay away from.
It can't go a couple of days without 

1706
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:35,870
some sort of training.
It makes me feel better.

1707
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:40,900
You know,
I'm suffering through a bulging disc 

1708
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:40,900
right now.
And I started getting rolfing.

1709
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,200
Rolfing though.
Thank God.

1710
01:12:42,201 --> 01:12:45,020
No,
I have not very painful,

1711
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:50,080
but it's really amazing.
And like what kind of pain relief it 

1712
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,180
gives you once the pain is over,
like the loosening of my back,

1713
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:57,480
my back feels more limber than it's felt
like a year.

1714
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,690
Like I've had an issue with my back for 
quite a while.

1715
01:12:59,691 --> 01:13:01,340
I could get injuries.
Neck is bad.

1716
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,020
You have bulging.
Uh,

1717
01:13:03,021 --> 01:13:03,550
yeah,
I think so.

1718
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,110
So do you,
did you get an MRI or anything?

1719
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:06,710
Did you get.
No,

1720
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:12,220
Scott,
this is years ago when I was at teen 

1721
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:12,220
punishment.
Somebody dropped me on my head and I,

1722
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,810
I it balls.
It herniated slight herniation here.

1723
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:16,850
Yeah.
And uh,

1724
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:20,730
I had therapy for like six months and 
they went okay,

1725
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:25,970
and this is a backline how many money?
So I had to have a friend of mine as 

1726
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:27,090
chiropractors take care of it,
but it was like therapy and it fixed it,

1727
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,920
but it's the one thing that I'll be 
sparring.

1728
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:30,950
I'll take one and I'll fill this and I 
got,

1729
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,000
I got to stop,
I keep going,

1730
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:34,440
then I got to put ice on it and all that
stuff.

1731
01:13:34,441 --> 01:13:38,520
It's just always a slight problem.
So you do still have a bulbs?

1732
01:13:38,521 --> 01:13:39,570
They're probably.
Yeah,

1733
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:41,190
no press in life.
Yeah.

1734
01:13:41,191 --> 01:13:43,020
If I get hit on the head janitor,

1735
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:47,160
what happened to mark Coleman apparently
got paralyzed.

1736
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,520
He was training with random and again 
and random and dumped amount his head 

1737
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,750
and he couldn't move for like,
I think it was something crazy like 30 

1738
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:00,291
seconds.
Like his body was just completely 

1739
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:00,291
frozen.
That's a scary 30 seconds.

1740
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:01,170
Oh my God.
Well he thought this is it.

1741
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:06,230
I'm going to be in a wheelchair for the 
rest of my life directly myself with my 

1742
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:06,230
mouth,
you know,

1743
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:07,120
and that's,
that's what could have happened to them.

1744
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:11,390
Going from the UFC heavyweight champion 
of the world and that from one like that

1745
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:13,300
wilkes retired because of that.
Did he?

1746
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,180
He was the guy that I fought actually 
when I was fighting.

1747
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:21,210
I fought James Walks and he had a some 
kind of herniation in his neck and set 

1748
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:22,900
and the doctor said,
if you keep doing this,

1749
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,280
you're going to risk paralysis.
And when I'm out I'm out.

1750
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:27,200
There's different ways to treat it,
you know,

1751
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:32,201
I'm the Ra thing though,
was a buddy of mine from the gym had a 

1752
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:35,730
good personal experience from it and he 
was like really painful stuff,

1753
01:14:35,731 --> 01:14:39,300
but when it's done,
like when they're breaking the muscle,

1754
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:44,690
like the muscle Fascia,
I guess they're ripping it off the scar 

1755
01:14:44,821 --> 01:14:46,440
tissue,
whatever they're dealing with,

1756
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:48,570
their elbows.
It's fucking horrifically painful.

1757
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:52,620
They put all their weight on,
but when it's done like man,

1758
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:57,621
like all the sudden like there's all 
this range of motion that wasn't there 

1759
01:14:57,621 --> 01:14:58,200
before and I tried to say like,
is this fuckery man?

1760
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,730
Is this like some,
some,

1761
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:04,790
some bullshit Voodoo that they put on me
and given me a rubber place hit with a 

1762
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:06,390
Hologram on it and saying it's gonna 
make my balance better.

1763
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,620
But I think objectives,
no,

1764
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,590
there's,
there's some serious relief in my.

1765
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:16,880
I'm pretty consistent about like deep 
tissue massage and all the different 

1766
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,030
things.
Chiropractic care,

1767
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:21,240
but this made a difference.
Like it was a noticeable difference.

1768
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:25,060
A fighter is always in pain.
I've never fought in a retrain.

1769
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:30,061
Don't understand that like any,
any athlete or basketball players and 

1770
01:15:30,061 --> 01:15:30,061
knees are shot.
I go,

1771
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:30,580
it's,
it's,

1772
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,960
they're constantly in pain and the 
difference between hurt and injured,

1773
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,450
his align a fighter is always walking a 
fighter.

1774
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:38,980
Never goes in.
Not hurt ever.

1775
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,490
I've never seen it.
That is always in pain

1776
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,330
thing is,
you know,

1777
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:49,380
a lot of guys trained through injuries 
and that's why how I fucked my backup 

1778
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,441
way worse.
It was like I injured it and then I was 

1779
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:52,441
like,
yeah,

1780
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:52,441
just keep rolling.
I'll just go talk to them.

1781
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:53,320
Call Roll Light.
I'll tap quicker,

1782
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:53,870
you know,
I won't,

1783
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,810
I won't put myself in strength.
Bullshit.

1784
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,270
Once you get out there,
you start rolling.

1785
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:01,390
Starting the whole purpose of role in.
It's try to get dudes.

1786
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:04,000
They're trying to get you and you can't 
try to get them.

1787
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:04,840
It's not fun.
No,

1788
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:05,930
you know,
so you're,

1789
01:16:05,931 --> 01:16:10,931
you're not going to enjoy it.
And the reason why you're doing in the 

1790
01:16:10,931 --> 01:16:10,931
first place,
most of this because it's fun.

1791
01:16:10,931 --> 01:16:13,270
So you're going to go after I'm going to
get to go home.

1792
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,460
Yeah.
I had done,

1793
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:19,580
I had numbness in my hand and I would 
get this pain in my elbow and things got

1794
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,140
the Ulnar nerve is so you'll see seven 
or something like that where your injury

1795
01:16:25,141 --> 01:16:26,160
is just here.
Yeah,

1796
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:28,530
that's a really scary one.
Getting dropped on the head sucks.

1797
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,280
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons I liked that.

1798
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:35,281
Jujitsu starts on the knees.
The bad thing is that a lot of guys 

1799
01:16:35,281 --> 01:16:38,350
don't have good take downs or take down 
defense and if you you face a wrestler,

1800
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:43,351
you're really fucked.
If you can't take him down and he's 

1801
01:16:43,351 --> 01:16:43,351
better standing because then you're 
doomed,

1802
01:16:43,351 --> 01:16:44,770
you're just going to get.
You're gonna get teed off on.

1803
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,960
It's easy to defend submissions if 
you've been grappling your whole life.

1804
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:49,610
It's just a natural thing for them.
It's really hard.

1805
01:16:49,611 --> 01:16:50,780
I hate carrying around,

1806
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:56,050
but man,
getting tossed around is one of the 

1807
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:56,780
easiest ways to get fucking seriously 
hurt when you're.

1808
01:16:56,781 --> 01:17:00,080
When you're wrestling with really good 
guys who can throw,

1809
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:05,081
you know guys who can.
They get double unders on you and they 

1810
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:07,790
fucking Suplex you legit in the gym 
where they're launching their back,

1811
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,840
like a fucking bridge,
you know,

1812
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:10,050
and

1813
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,100
slamming you into the ground first with 
them behind you.

1814
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:18,101
All 200 plus pounds of them,
you can get really fucked up like 

1815
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:19,990
separated shoulders.
Terrible disc injuries.

1816
01:17:19,991 --> 01:17:24,991
So I don't fuck with that man.
I know it's an important thing to do to 

1817
01:17:24,991 --> 01:17:26,120
like roll with a guy like that to know 
what's possible.

1818
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:31,121
But the,
the worries about getting slammed on 

1819
01:17:31,121 --> 01:17:31,430
your head.
To me that's a big one.

1820
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:32,780
That's a,
that's a gigantic.

1821
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,850
The most injuries I've ever seen in 
combat sports.

1822
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:38,090
Judo,
there's judo is like.

1823
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,440
It's funny because people don't think 
about it.

1824
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:40,610
It's like man,
that's.

1825
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,810
It doesn't seem like it would be the 
worst.

1826
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:45,060
People get thrown in their elements pop 
out or nice.

1827
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:46,880
Probably a fault.
I mean world champs.

1828
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:52,010
Yeah.
You'll shoot a broke his arm in a 

1829
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:52,010
tournament because.
And that's a world champ.

1830
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:52,010
Yeah.
Do you just,

1831
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:52,670
you don't see that that often?

1832
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,590
Like hardly ever will a guy,
you know?

1833
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,410
Occasionally I'll get an arm broke,
easily tap,

1834
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,660
but they typically don't want to tap.
When you get thrown,

1835
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:02,750
you're not in shock array.
Haji gracie fight where he didn't.

1836
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,420
Sap tucks it in his.
He'd let them fight and he let him break

1837
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:08,060
his fucking arm and then he got out of 
it and won by points.

1838
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:11,700
I could not believe I trained machine 
grab too,

1839
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:14,000
but how?
What is his mentality?

1840
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:16,520
He let a dude break his arm and a 
Jujitsu tournament.

1841
01:18:16,521 --> 01:18:18,830
Where's he going?
What is he gonna win that $100,

1842
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:20,000
man.
What the fuck is he going to win?

1843
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:22,890
How much is it?
You just do tournament pay at 20,000.

1844
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:28,130
What's.
What's it worth to get your fucking arm 

1845
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:28,700
salute?
Final match of the absolute sued stuffed

1846
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:33,701
in there and this is after you'd already
won his division and just defended for 

1847
01:18:33,701 --> 01:18:34,580
the last few seconds for him.

1848
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:36,560
Big Deal for him,
man.

1849
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,480
He's a beast.
Dude's a beast.

1850
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:41,150
That's a.
that's a serious competitor man who lets

1851
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,490
you break his fucking arm and just says,
fuck it.

1852
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:44,360
I'm going to keep up.
Well,

1853
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:45,830
here's one thing.
Here's one mentality.

1854
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:47,480
Here's,
here's one thing you can say though,

1855
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:51,230
is there is the idea of,
well,

1856
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:52,370
fuck it,
it's already broken.

1857
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:54,900
I got a minute and I remember it wasn't 
a lot of time left.

1858
01:18:54,901 --> 01:18:57,680
Let's say a minute and a half left of a 
10 minute match and he went,

1859
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:00,620
it's already broken.
It's not going to get more broken.

1860
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,750
Fuck it.
Maybe I can win this thing.

1861
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,780
It's not the kind of thing where it's 
like an MCL goes out and like if I stand

1862
01:19:05,781 --> 01:19:07,400
on this,
it's going to get even worse.

1863
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,430
Fucking broken is broken on.
It ain't gonna get a whole lot worse and

1864
01:19:10,431 --> 01:19:11,870
when I got a minute left and made it.

1865
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:14,330
Yeah.
That was the mentality of yeah,

1866
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:16,720
I can't make it twice I guess,
but can.

1867
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:21,110
The real problem is when a guy gets a 
physical injury like that,

1868
01:19:21,111 --> 01:19:23,280
like you'd get an arm snapped or a nice 
nap,

1869
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:28,720
you might not ever be the same again and
you might have to go through Rehab for 

1870
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,410
seven months,
eight months if you're lucky.

1871
01:19:30,411 --> 01:19:33,650
If everything goes perfect,
if you can schedule your surgery in time

1872
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,450
and then go through it all,
it's like,

1873
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:38,510
that's why everybody's terrified of guys
like who's Mr Paul Harris,

1874
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:43,800
who some are,
gets a hold of your leg and starts 

1875
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,421
rolling and he's,
I think he's my height and a foot wider 

1876
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,050
than me,
you know,

1877
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:53,051
I mean,
I don't know how much weight he cuts to 

1878
01:19:53,051 --> 01:19:53,051
get down to a hundred 85 pounds.
But he's,

1879
01:19:53,051 --> 01:19:54,320
he literally looks like a cartoon 
figure.

1880
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,260
He's,
he's from,

1881
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,780
from my team.
Carlson Gracie,

1882
01:19:56,810 --> 01:20:01,810
you know,
he's one of them was the Montana is and 

1883
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:01,810
I'm with Haiti.
Yoga was you the same family and stuff.

1884
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:04,760
And uh,
the dude is one of those guys where it's

1885
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:06,400
like,
you are,

1886
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:07,970
you.
Are you okay

1887
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:13,150
to Jujitsu all you do because it's like 
if you saw in Abu Dhabi and he took on 

1888
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:16,110
God I,
Marco's Avalon,

1889
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,990
I want to say had him and he'll hook.
Yes,

1890
01:20:18,991 --> 01:20:19,860
yes,
yes.

1891
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,990
And he keeps rolling and they're like,
we're out of bounds.

1892
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:25,170
And he taps and he knew that Marcos have
law was lightening up because they're at

1893
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:30,171
a browns.
And then he just went for the kill and 

1894
01:20:30,171 --> 01:20:30,171
try to submit it,
but he stood up like,

1895
01:20:30,171 --> 01:20:30,330
Oh,
good match,

1896
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:33,430
because that one was furious.
Then remember they restarted,

1897
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,030
they restart and when the heel hook tap 
and they said,

1898
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:37,740
ready go,
you can't do that.

1899
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:42,970
You can't because there's a lot of 
momentum and moving and you generate 

1900
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:43,830
that momentum to say stop,
ready,

1901
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:48,831
go.
That's a big advantage to the guy that 

1902
01:20:48,831 --> 01:20:51,411
was applying to submission you,
you allowed him to get to a superior 

1903
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:55,491
position because that initial explosion 
is way quicker to do with your arm like 

1904
01:20:55,491 --> 01:20:57,990
that than it is to do with your leg and 
twisting your fucking foot.

1905
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:00,000
That's already in a bad spot.
Ready?

1906
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:05,001
Go.
But it's the idea of more because I was 

1907
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:07,810
clearly upset and,
and Tokyo is like,

1908
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,400
are you paying attention?
Slapped him.

1909
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,770
When he went to hug him,
like he hit him,

1910
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,870
which maps.
And he jumped up on the fence before the

1911
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:16,920
fight was over.
Oh,

1912
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:20,820
that was Kim Miller.
Dan Miller,

1913
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:22,860
Dan Miller.
It's that combination of,

1914
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:29,220
you know,
sick on the ground and not all their 

1915
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:29,490
upstairs is frightening.
Yeah.

1916
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,610
He's a nut frightening and he's been a 
leg snapper forever.

1917
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,510
Years.
Yeah.

1918
01:21:33,511 --> 01:21:35,520
He's,
if you've never seen him.

1919
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:37,620
He says,
Harry guerrilla type man.

1920
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:40,540
And his technique is lawless.
Yeah,

1921
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,310
he's so strong,
but his technique is perfect.

1922
01:21:44,311 --> 01:21:49,311
There's a video online with him rolling 
with mayhem in Brazil and he takes me.

1923
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,450
He takes him down like smoothly passes,
um,

1924
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:58,700
takes his back and then transitions to 
the arm bar all in one glorious move.

1925
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:00,450
And you watch them.
You Go,

1926
01:22:00,451 --> 01:22:04,320
God damn,
that guy's just fluid like water.

1927
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:05,530
I mean,
the way he,

1928
01:22:05,531 --> 01:22:07,440
he,
he ducked under ma'am.

1929
01:22:07,441 --> 01:22:08,790
Scooped him,
dumped him,

1930
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,830
just took his back,
took the arm by.

1931
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:11,670
You're like,
well,

1932
01:22:11,671 --> 01:22:12,830
I know mayhem,
man.

1933
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:16,770
Mayhem is no joke.
Man has a very good ground game.

1934
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:18,270
He's got very good defense.

1935
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,480
He survives a lot of shit.
And to see that guy run through them 

1936
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:23,480
like that,
he like,

1937
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,060
Woo wasn't even there.
Yeah,

1938
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:25,950
he's a,
he's a bad motherfucker,

1939
01:22:25,951 --> 01:22:27,180
but no.
Plan B,

1940
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:33,970
Plan B,
the hector lumbar fight was a terrible 

1941
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:36,540
matchup for him because Hector Lombard 
is so fucking powerful with his hands.

1942
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:39,120
And Hector's takedown defense is 
ridiculous.

1943
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:44,270
When you see the Tim Boetsch fight,
it wasn't a good fight for hector was 

1944
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:44,270
one of his worst fights ever,
but look good.

1945
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:46,320
It's fucking takedown defense is.
I mean,

1946
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:49,800
he sprawls and slammed down to the 
ground with them.

1947
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:52,560
That is a power sprawl.
When he gets those,

1948
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,000
you know,
when Bush shot in on him and he,

1949
01:22:55,030 --> 01:23:00,030
he,
he over under them and kicked his hips 

1950
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:00,030
back and drop the two of them down to 
the ground.

1951
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:00,840
You're like,
whoa.

1952
01:23:00,841 --> 01:23:03,510
That is some other worldly strength.
That's another dude.

1953
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,800
He's like five foot nothing and like 
feet wide.

1954
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:05,980
He's

1955
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,820
like five,
seven,

1956
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:11,821
five,
eight and just built like a fucking 

1957
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,420
comic book hero and his,
his movement,

1958
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,970
like the shit that he's,
that he can do to people,

1959
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,110
you know,
it's striking the put on people.

1960
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:24,160
He's just a ridiculous,
ridiculous athletic specimen.

1961
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,060
Josh Barnett said that a heat taught him
muscle ups,

1962
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,950
you know,
that he had never done it before,

1963
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:35,040
which a muscle up is.
You start with a chin up and then you 

1964
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,570
pull yourself up to your Chin and then 
you push yourself all the way up to like

1965
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:42,571
a dip.
So you're fully extended and he said 

1966
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:42,571
like,
it's hard to do.

1967
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:43,820
Like Alistair Overeem,
they liked,

1968
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:46,340
someone was trying to,
they had one of those gymnastics do,

1969
01:23:46,341 --> 01:23:47,680
it's like street,
you know,

1970
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:51,520
let's treat workout dudes that do a lot 
of like crazy core strength,

1971
01:23:51,521 --> 01:23:56,521
athletic moves and he couldn't do it,
helped along by just starts whipping 

1972
01:23:56,521 --> 01:23:56,521
them off.
Bam,

1973
01:23:56,521 --> 01:23:56,710
Bam,
Bam,

1974
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,050
Bam.
Just does like 10 muscle ups in a row,

1975
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:03,160
which is impossible to,
to never have done it before.

1976
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,590
And just pull yourself up like that over
and over again.

1977
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:07,480
You got to be unbelievably strong.

1978
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:10,130
I've had people tell me that when he was
at CSW,

1979
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:15,160
which is Josh,
Brian's team here in southern 

1980
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:15,160
California,
uh,

1981
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:15,160
on Fulton.
They were like,

1982
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:15,740
mop up the blood when they would spar.
Oh yes.

1983
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:19,880
Hector does not know how to spar.
Luckily he doesn't know how to be like,

1984
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:22,420
he just goes full out all the time.
Just Barnett.

1985
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,240
Gigantic dude.

1986
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:28,360
Well,
there's a legendary story of Josh 

1987
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,630
Barnett,
like punishing him or he got on he 

1988
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:32,261
mounted and they would not let them go 
and just kept beating them up because 

1989
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:36,880
apparently there was an issue with 
hector beating up other people in the 

1990
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,100
gym.
If you're sparring hector,

1991
01:24:37,101 --> 01:24:42,101
that's always been the knock is that 
he's going to fight you like you're 

1992
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:42,101
fighting.
Yeah.

1993
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:42,101
Thank you.
So God damn competitive.

1994
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:45,470
And he's so fucking good.
He just needs to destroy all the time.

1995
01:24:45,471 --> 01:24:47,720
He's like,
this is fucking destruction machine,

1996
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:48,450
you know?
And,

1997
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:49,260
and it,
you know,

1998
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,320
he even talks about it in post fight 
interviews,

1999
01:24:51,321 --> 01:24:52,430
one of the posts.
But you know,

2000
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,020
my trainers say you have to be nicer.
You know,

2001
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:57,310
I can't have toys to play with.
You break your toys,

2002
01:24:57,311 --> 01:24:59,870
you can play with bro Bro.
That's what it is,

2003
01:24:59,871 --> 01:25:00,840
bro.
Dudes,

2004
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:02,270
he's a,
he's a scary guy.

2005
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,160
He is.
But I'm glad he's back on track.

2006
01:25:04,161 --> 01:25:05,660
That is,
if I put it back on track,

2007
01:25:05,661 --> 01:25:07,400
certainly so many exciting fights for 
him.

2008
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,690
You know,
there's a,

2009
01:25:08,691 --> 01:25:11,810
the thing about having only two 
promotions,

2010
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:17,080
it's like,
I mean there's other like small feeder 

2011
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:17,080
promotions that go,

2012
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:17,800
well,
it's a national promotion.

2013
01:25:17,801 --> 01:25:18,690
It's belt on UFC.

2014
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,320
That's it.
That's all there is now.

2015
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:25,350
I mean,
especially now that strikeforce has 

2016
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,350
done,
but there's so many guys.

2017
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,350
They go,
damn,

2018
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:26,750
I want to see that guy over there.
Like,

2019
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,800
Oh yeah,
I would love to see Chandler fight 

2020
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,530
Benson.
I think that would be fucking test.

2021
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:38,190
I would love that fight.
I would love to see pet current fight 

2022
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,410
basically any 145 pounder in the world.
I a great against pimples,

2023
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:44,420
great graphite and he's another one were
really follows the principles of being 

2024
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:47,770
technically sound really tight,
tight,

2025
01:25:47,771 --> 01:25:48,710
tight,
tight and not.

2026
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:50,200
It doesn't open.
Exposed himself,

2027
01:25:50,201 --> 01:25:55,201
doesn't go emotionally.
It doesn't do anything crazy but mixes 

2028
01:25:55,201 --> 01:25:58,861
things up really good.
Like between punches and knees that you 

2029
01:25:58,861 --> 01:25:58,861
don't see.
Comment and kicks.

2030
01:25:58,861 --> 01:25:59,110
You don't see common.
No.

2031
01:25:59,111 --> 01:26:00,880
Wind up with the kicks,
you know?

2032
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:05,930
It's throwing a lot of kicks,
karate style that are getting when you 

2033
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:06,110
don't expect him to.
He's a bad motherfucker.

2034
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,270
He's very good.
Sandro fight,

2035
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:10,280
dude,
when you kicked him,

2036
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:11,180
I was like,
oh,

2037
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:12,440
done.
I could not.

2038
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:13,330
I did not say that.
Come on.

2039
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,920
Yes.
Sandra was a beast standing too.

2040
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:18,380
He's a dangerous fucking strike or 
knocked him dead.

2041
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,330
He's very,
very,

2042
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:21,220
very good.
There's,

2043
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,130
there's a few of those guys,
you know that or I see and I go,

2044
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:26,810
damn,
I wish I could get that guy in the UFC.

2045
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:31,040
I get to see my Melatonin.
I'm sure.

2046
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:36,280
Well,
I hope that eventually they figure out 

2047
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:36,620
some way where you know,
there can be,

2048
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:41,950
you know,
like if it comes to a point where 

2049
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:43,811
there's some bellatore heavyweight that 
is just the shit and just destroying 

2050
01:26:43,811 --> 01:26:43,811
people.
It's all over television.

2051
01:26:43,811 --> 01:26:48,730
If it gets to a point,
but ideally it would be great if there 

2052
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:51,971
was like equal value because if it was 
equal value then everybody would get 

2053
01:26:51,971 --> 01:26:52,040
together and said,
listen,

2054
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:54,110
we've got to promote.
Let's fucking make a deal.

2055
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:55,190
Come on.
What do we do in here?

2056
01:26:55,191 --> 01:27:00,191
This is crazy.
Let's chop this up and let's figure out 

2057
01:27:00,191 --> 01:27:00,191
a way to get the best fighters in the 
world fighting.

2058
01:27:00,191 --> 01:27:00,191
But

2059
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:05,300
the UFC to its credit is so the brand 
has been marketed so incredibly well in 

2060
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:12,740
so incredibly well that the value behind
the UFC brand is so high.

2061
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:14,240
Yeah.
That,

2062
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:14,660
that,
you know,

2063
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,070
that's what it is.
A brand behind the UFC is so high that,

2064
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:18,880
that,
that brand is what's on the line if they

2065
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:19,760
finally you see either the best.

2066
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,130
Yeah.
And that that's what's on the line.

2067
01:27:21,131 --> 01:27:23,170
It's kind of crazy because when we first
started,

2068
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,590
when I became a fan,
the one thing that me and my friends sit

2069
01:27:26,591 --> 01:27:31,591
around and think that mma needed because
a lot of folks don't know that in 1997 

2070
01:27:31,591 --> 01:27:35,290
and then may was so underground,
most people had no idea what it is.

2071
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:36,520
And I always said,
you know what?

2072
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,760
We need some like crazy billionaires 
that happened in be fight fans to just 

2073
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:46,520
come along and buy it.
But I never thought that was actually 

2074
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,051
gonna happen.
And then it would actually be like some 

2075
01:27:49,051 --> 01:27:49,540
of the nicest fucking guys on the planet
earth,

2076
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:54,541
like Lorenzo in Frankfurt or some of the
nicest fucking human beings you could 

2077
01:27:54,541 --> 01:27:56,830
ever want to meet that gentleman in 
every sense of the word.

2078
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:59,830
They're easy to talk to.
They're friendly,

2079
01:27:59,831 --> 01:28:02,440
they're kind,
they're cool motherfuckers.

2080
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,900
And they love fights.
They love boxing.

2081
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:07,750
They bet stupid money on boxing.
Like all of the time.

2082
01:28:07,751 --> 01:28:12,751
They're big floyd mayweather fans and 
they were big ricky Hatton fans and you 

2083
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:12,751
know,
they,

2084
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:13,540
they,
they love combat sports.

2085
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:15,160
It's always been a passion for them.
And they,

2086
01:28:15,161 --> 01:28:17,260
oh,
they also happen to own 20 casinos.

2087
01:28:17,261 --> 01:28:17,860
Yeah,
that helps.

2088
01:28:17,861 --> 01:28:21,400
Yeah,
it was like literally like we manifested

2089
01:28:21,401 --> 01:28:25,270
them like we created the Joe Rogan.
Thank you Joe Rogan.

2090
01:28:25,271 --> 01:28:28,070
I appreciate that buddy.
We needed billionaires to come along and

2091
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:30,460
it's like the,
it's almost like simulation theory,

2092
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:31,060
like you know,
the,

2093
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:36,070
the,
the universe provides you what your 

2094
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,070
creative imagination is trying to 
concoct.

2095
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,790
Exactly.
I don't know.

2096
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,640
I don't really buy that,
but I do buy that.

2097
01:28:39,641 --> 01:28:44,641
We were lucky as fuck to have the 
fertittas come along and they spent so 

2098
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:47,971
much money to get the UFC to where it is
before they actually started making 

2099
01:28:47,971 --> 01:28:51,991
money.
That at one point in time they were 

2100
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:53,551
thinking about quitting.
They were like 40 something million 

2101
01:28:53,551 --> 01:28:53,551
dollars in the hole.
That's what people don't know.

2102
01:28:53,551 --> 01:28:53,551
People.

2103
01:28:53,551 --> 01:28:57,210
People talk about MMA and UFC like it 
was a home run.

2104
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,090
That was of course,
of course it was going to be big,

2105
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:01,290
right?
It wasn't.

2106
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:02,100
They took and

2107
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,110
people that I don't understand who,
who,

2108
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:08,730
who,
who knocked the UFC and and look,

2109
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,480
they took the risk and put the money in 
when it wasn't a home run,

2110
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,280
you know,
when like you said,

2111
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:19,281
they were 40 in the hole and I didn't 
super intelligent and they did create a 

2112
01:29:19,281 --> 01:29:23,010
brand.
They built the brand up and they got it 

2113
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:23,010
to where it is and they deserve every 
fucking penny.

2114
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:23,780
They knew exactly what.
I think that's,

2115
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:25,380
that's,
that's reality.

2116
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:30,330
You know,
and the sport would not be here where it

2117
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:32,070
is right now if it wasn't for those 
guys.

2118
01:29:32,071 --> 01:29:34,410
That's just a fact.
If they didn't spend that money and take

2119
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:37,350
that chance,
it's it had to get promoted,

2120
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,200
but it's amazing that it did.
You know?

2121
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,190
It really is like,
I'm so psyched.

2122
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:45,750
We're going to Chicago this weekend and 
I'm going to.

2123
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:50,830
We're going to be fire fights on Fox and
it's great fucking fights.

2124
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:54,780
It's you're going to have rampage versus
glover to sharer.

2125
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:59,810
That's a great fucking fight.
And then pedes versus Serona's happened 

2126
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:02,700
for two and Dotson.
Dotson is going to fight for the title.

2127
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,640
He's fighting mighty mouse.
That's going to be a sick fight.

2128
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:10,690
That's going to be a fight.
If folks can get past the fact that 

2129
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:13,960
these guys weigh 18 pounds,
get past to get past the size.

2130
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:17,420
These 100 and 125 pounds,
they're,

2131
01:30:17,421 --> 01:30:20,520
they're the baddest motherfuckers on the
planet earth like pound for pound.

2132
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:22,440
No one moves.
Like these guys.

2133
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:24,300
You want to talk about guys who are 
technical,

2134
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,540
like mighty mouse is so fucking 
technical.

2135
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:31,080
He's so good at mixing up the take downs
with,

2136
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,480
with,
with stand up and his.

2137
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:38,630
His timing and his speed and delivery is
sensational and he comes from an 

2138
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:42,120
interesting lineage to me because I was 
just talking about his trainer Matt Hume

2139
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:42,720
the other day.

2140
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,180
There's very few guys that mission 
started out,

2141
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:49,530
not just that,
I mean basically every coaching stuff,

2142
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:54,531
but matt hume started out when MMA was.
It was pankration and it was.

2143
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:59,140
I mean,
he was literally in the just post,

2144
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:02,730
post hoists,
gracie wave and add all those guys,

2145
01:31:02,731 --> 01:31:06,190
whether it's the lion's den or whether 
it's uh,

2146
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,650
you know,
the military camp.

2147
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,320
All these camps that rose up from those 
ranks.

2148
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:15,650
Matt Hume has stayed ahead of the curve 
and continue to evolve his teaching and 

2149
01:31:16,861 --> 01:31:20,280
his game and his fighters to where the 
sports at.

2150
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:23,790
Whereas like a lot of guys get stuck.
They get stuck with a certain style.

2151
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:25,460
You know,
there's the hammer house style.

2152
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:28,410
There's fucking lion's den style.
And that style,

2153
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,520
as those sport becomes this sort of Rory
Macdonald,

2154
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:37,521
GSP type athletic dominance sport.
The guys who really continued to advance

2155
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:43,470
or rare,
the guys who make it from that early 

2156
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:44,940
pioneer age where Matt Hume's fighting,
if you go back and look at Matt,

2157
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:49,970
Matt Hume fought pat melted way before 
pat military ever won the UFC title 

2158
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:51,450
because no knows where the neat man.
Humans very,

2159
01:31:51,451 --> 01:31:54,120
very technical stand up and had good 
ground game.

2160
01:31:54,121 --> 01:31:57,950
He submitted a Kenny Monday and one of 
those submission only matching.

2161
01:31:57,951 --> 01:32:00,190
Yeah.
That was something called contenders

2162
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,230
I want was like God,
that was.

2163
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,410
That was a good contenders or something 
with some paper grappling thing.

2164
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:08,380
Frank shamrock submitted data and 
understood the heel hook inverted.

2165
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:09,490
He'll hook you up.
Yeah,

2166
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:13,510
that was nasty.
There was a lot of interesting of in Dan

2167
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:15,970
Gable gave commentary on it as well.
I think it was already.

2168
01:32:15,971 --> 01:32:17,350
It was already.
It was pretty involved.

2169
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,110
I don't remember that.
I remember the matches,

2170
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:25,111
but I don't remember what I was hoping 
that that would actually become 

2171
01:32:25,111 --> 01:32:27,721
something that people could watch 
because I think there's something cool 

2172
01:32:27,721 --> 01:32:31,201
about watching,
like really aggressive submission 

2173
01:32:31,201 --> 01:32:31,201
grappling.
You know,

2174
01:32:31,201 --> 01:32:31,330
if you watch them,
Marcello Garcia,

2175
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:35,410
you watch a jock array or jake shields,
someone who really goes after the finish

2176
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:40,560
and you know,
to see that on television I think would 

2177
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:41,380
be really interesting for people,
but,

2178
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:44,610
but that's the part that we have the 
most trouble translating May.

2179
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,030
That's the part where people start 
booing and you know,

2180
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:52,080
and I'm seeing something awesome and 
crowd's booing and that's okay.

2181
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:55,030
That doesn't matter.
You can't make everybody happy.

2182
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:58,930
You can see what I'm saying.
But what I'm saying is MMA,

2183
01:32:58,931 --> 01:33:00,790
which has a ton of action and some 
grappling,

2184
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:06,230
the grapplers part,
we have the people that have at least 

2185
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:06,230
attempts to meet with someone that's all
grappling.

2186
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:10,650
That's a hard sell.
They tried to do a real pro wrestling 

2187
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:10,650
which Kenny Johnson,
again finishing in that.

2188
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:13,780
The difference I think is in this 
submission.

2189
01:33:13,781 --> 01:33:15,640
Who watches Abu Dhabi?
I mean guys like us,

2190
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:20,380
but it's not like it's in,
you know,

2191
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:25,440
on Espn.
It's not like it's in the front of 

2192
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:25,960
sports illustrated who's the best 
strangler on the planet earth.

2193
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:28,600
You know what I mean?
I think that's something that's missing.

2194
01:33:28,601 --> 01:33:33,601
I think there's two things that are 
missing and I think high level 

2195
01:33:33,601 --> 01:33:33,990
kickboxing is the other one.
I think like eye level kickboxing,

2196
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,070
like k one,
like I know glory.

2197
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:38,440
Just put on a pay per view event.
I think they're going to do something in

2198
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:40,650
America this year and they might throw 
in a lot of money.

2199
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:41,170
Yeah,
yeah.

2200
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:43,090
They might be able to pull it off.
I didn't.

2201
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,390
I wasn't down with their last thing 
because they had like,

2202
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:47,080
I watched it,
I bought the paper you,

2203
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:49,210
but it was four fights in a night.
I was like,

2204
01:33:49,211 --> 01:33:54,211
that's crazy.
And they were making the guys fight two 

2205
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:54,211
minute rounds for five,
two minute rounds.

2206
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:54,940
I was one out of Japan.
Right?

2207
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,000
Was that in Japan?
Because they had a new year's eve show,

2208
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:59,770
I believe it was Japan.
It was.

2209
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:05,340
Yes.
It was because it was in combination 

2210
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:05,340
with dreams.
They also,

2211
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,180
they did both of them back to back in 
the same place and it was incredible.

2212
01:34:07,181 --> 01:34:09,520
I mean,
it was a really fucking good fights,

2213
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:14,550
but to see Daniel Gita in the final 
round against semi shell just exhausted 

2214
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:19,500
having fought three fucking tough fights
and the third fight was against that big

2215
01:34:19,661 --> 01:34:20,470
giant dude.

2216
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:23,020
I forget the guy's name,
but he's 300 pounds,

2217
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:28,140
six foot eight.
He's a bad motherfucker and he's he and 

2218
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:28,370
you know,
and he beat up on [inaudible].

2219
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:33,440
So it's like these guys are going 
through unbelievable punishment before 

2220
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,811
they ever get to the final fight.
I would way rather see individual 

2221
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:36,811
supernatural card.
Yeah.

2222
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:39,880
I don't like tournament's man.
I think it's stupid because I think it's

2223
01:34:39,881 --> 01:34:42,500
unfair if one guy wins in a seven 
second,

2224
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:47,520
don't take that personally at school to 
work on Solo tour tournaments where you 

2225
01:34:49,331 --> 01:34:51,940
fight multiple times in a night in the 
same night.

2226
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,430
It just too many variables that are just
who can go through that.

2227
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:59,650
I don't.
I like a tournament format where you 

2228
01:34:59,650 --> 01:34:59,650
build to one final

2229
01:34:59,650 --> 01:34:59,690
contender.
I liked that.

2230
01:34:59,691 --> 01:35:02,300
I liked what I liked,
what [inaudible] does.

2231
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:07,301
I like what a dream does,
but what I used to do a couple of the 

2232
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:11,900
night opening two in one night.
It's interesting because you want to see

2233
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:16,901
what happens when vandelay meets,
you know rampage and you want to see 

2234
01:35:16,901 --> 01:35:17,020
what happens when they meet in the 
finals,

2235
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:20,540
but variables.
The reality is if you,

2236
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:22,310
if you fight more than one time at 
night,

2237
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:25,250
you could be really busted up and maybe 
can cuss.

2238
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:27,180
Especially if you're fighting Japan.
Oh my God.

2239
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:28,940
Okay.
That'll stop.

2240
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:30,710
Anything.
They will let you fight.

2241
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:33,380
Even if you're concussed.
If you got concussed in your first fight

2242
01:35:33,381 --> 01:35:38,381
and then you go out,
they'll let you go off for the second 

2243
01:35:38,381 --> 01:35:38,381
flight.

2244
01:35:38,381 --> 01:35:40,340
I've,
I've had some people ask me about 

2245
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:42,450
recently,
would a mortar thing like glory be 

2246
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:42,450
successful?
United States,

2247
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:44,950
I think mmm.
May Have paved the road where people are

2248
01:35:44,951 --> 01:35:49,951
used to seeing more Thai and kickboxing 
and MMA and appreciating it and we'll 

2249
01:35:49,951 --> 01:35:52,870
obviously throw the dollars toward a 
good Moitai promotion.

2250
01:35:52,871 --> 01:35:54,250
I think it can work and I think,
like I said,

2251
01:35:54,251 --> 01:35:56,800
the MMA fans that have gotten used to 
that kind of striking.

2252
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,050
That's what paved the way.
I think a few years ago didn't work.

2253
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:04,150
Yeah,
I think it never did in the United 

2254
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:04,150
States.
We never been big on Kik.

2255
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:06,900
Well,
you know what it is as the PKA karate 

2256
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:06,900
shit ruined it for everybody because it 
was so bad.

2257
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:07,810
It was so.
It was awful.

2258
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:09,370
It was so silly.
I don't watch that.

2259
01:36:09,371 --> 01:36:11,110
If you guys listen,
you don't know what we're talking about.

2260
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:13,130
Good.
Don't want to watch it.

2261
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:18,360
Just to see what we're talking about.
They used to have this rule where you 

2262
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,580
had to throw a certain amount of kicks 
in around,

2263
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,760
so you had like these sloppy kicks in.
Then you had bad boxing and you had 

2264
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:24,950
like.
I mean just.

2265
01:36:24,951 --> 01:36:27,290
I'm just going to be honest.
They were inferior athletes.

2266
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:32,291
They just weren't that good and no one 
ever looked at the best of the PKA guys 

2267
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:32,420
and said,
hey,

2268
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:35,150
that guy could fuck up.
Marvin Hagler.

2269
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:40,800
No one thought they knew that Marvin 
Hagler was just going to jump all over 

2270
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:41,660
him.
They weren't in the same quality.

2271
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:45,330
I saw some boxers who got into it for 
the money and literally went,

2272
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:50,420
went to a different mindset through like
six kicks to get the number they needed 

2273
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:50,420
in the round and then they'd box the 
rest of the round,

2274
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:53,020
beat the guys at.
It's.

2275
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:58,360
It was a bad style because they didn't 
incorporate leg kicks and knees and 

2276
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:02,401
elbows and all the things that make 
kickboxing and more time more 

2277
01:37:02,401 --> 01:37:02,401
interesting.
Yeah,

2278
01:37:02,401 --> 01:37:03,310
and then once they started doing that 
though,

2279
01:37:03,311 --> 01:37:06,690
in Japan with k one,
it became some of the most.

2280
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:11,910
It went from being boring as fuck to 
some of the most exciting fights in the 

2281
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:15,961
history of combat.
Sports were fought in the k one days of 

2282
01:37:15,961 --> 01:37:18,850
Japan where most people have no idea 
they were even going on because in Japan

2283
01:37:18,851 --> 01:37:21,940
it was gigantic.
They had Andy Hook and Ernesto hoost and

2284
01:37:21,941 --> 01:37:26,941
they put together,
these Japanese are such bad 

2285
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:29,431
motherfuckers.
They put together these giant 

2286
01:37:29,431 --> 01:37:32,160
tournament's featuring the greatest kick
on earth and made them fight each other 

2287
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,410
on multiple occasions.

2288
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:36,750
One poor tiny Japanese did in there too.
Every now was.

2289
01:37:36,751 --> 01:37:41,751
The hilarious part to me is the kind of 
freak show matches he used to put 

2290
01:37:41,751 --> 01:37:41,751
together,
but k one was the shit.

2291
01:37:41,751 --> 01:37:41,751
Oh Man.

2292
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:42,910
Yeah.
They was put together.

2293
01:37:42,911 --> 01:37:45,080
They would put together some freak shows
while they put together.

2294
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,120
Bob Sapp.
Yeah.

2295
01:37:46,121 --> 01:37:48,220
Bob Sapp it.
Ernesto hoost is the greatest freak show

2296
01:37:48,221 --> 01:37:50,620
match up ever.
I can't believe we lost him.

2297
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:54,640
He wasn't twice,
twice in a row and he had to come back.

2298
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:59,670
He had to come back.
We played that fight and we were like 

2299
01:37:59,670 --> 01:37:59,670
fucking around doing color commentary on
the show.

2300
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,050
We were talking about what an amazing 
fight it was like.

2301
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:06,070
Yeah,
he dropped him with a fucking left hook 

2302
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:08,481
to the body and hurt him bad.
Like Bob Sapp was hurt bad and Ernesto 

2303
01:38:08,481 --> 01:38:11,490
was chopping at his legs,
but he was so big and so fucking strong.

2304
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:12,390
That a one.
Anyway,

2305
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:15,420
you know who bob said reminds you of 
when it goes down,

2306
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:17,730
ball bowl.
Do you remember the punch out?

2307
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:20,360
Ball ball is.
I like this,

2308
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:22,690
I like that.
And His.

2309
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,330
I'll pop out.
The dude looks like ball ball.

2310
01:38:25,331 --> 01:38:26,950
Whenever he goes down,
that's fucked up.

2311
01:38:26,951 --> 01:38:29,170
You say that because he broke his eye 
socket,

2312
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:34,200
remember that fucked his eye up,
and then as I looked weird number ball 

2313
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:34,200
ball,
man,

2314
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:34,270
I'm serious.

2315
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:39,640
That happens to do.
They get that eye socket break and then 

2316
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,970
they develop that one weird because of 
that and then they're still fighting.

2317
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,130
That's when you know Shit's

2318
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,290
real.
When one moves,

2319
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,210
the other one didn't know that that's a 
problem.

2320
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:49,880
Did Marillo Ninja have brain surgery?
What is the story with that?

2321
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:54,940
I have not heard anything because we 
know that you not having brain surgery 

2322
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:58,751
and still fight today,
you can have some things done that 

2323
01:38:58,751 --> 01:39:02,051
actually it's not even like they have to
clean something up like Tiago Alvez 

2324
01:39:02,051 --> 01:39:06,410
member.
They had an insert like some crazy glue 

2325
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:07,370
in his brain and he had a week something
or another.

2326
01:39:07,371 --> 01:39:12,371
There was some issue where they did like
a micro surgery and then he was back to 

2327
01:39:12,371 --> 01:39:16,271
fighting like shortly thereafter,
which is really hard to wrap your head 

2328
01:39:16,271 --> 01:39:19,850
around that they were inserting glue 
into his dome and then they're like,

2329
01:39:19,851 --> 01:39:20,200
yeah,
yeah,

2330
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:24,110
you're good to go get back there and get
fucking shinned in the head again.

2331
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:27,470
Right.
Like we were saying before,

2332
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:30,440
that second generation,
you're starting to go,

2333
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,400
so.
And Sony's Danisha Babaloo.

2334
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:36,530
I got my own house.
It's time to pack them my.

2335
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:39,670
And it's hard for us.
Who saw guys like that in warship guys?

2336
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:44,970
Yeah.
La Ballou has one of the scariest old 

2337
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:49,710
school valley Tudo knockouts ever.
You remember Brad Kohler,

2338
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:52,410
brand core,
brand Kohler.

2339
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:54,820
Who had one of the best.
We look at Rhino.

2340
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:57,600
Unbelievably muscular,
solid dude.

2341
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:02,750
He had one of the best one punch Kaos 
ever and that was an example that we 

2342
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:07,671
were talking about before about a 
Bressler being able to generate that 

2343
01:40:07,671 --> 01:40:07,860
same double leg,
take down power into a punch.

2344
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:11,630
And that's what Brad didn't eat.
I forget who the dude was.

2345
01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:15,920
It was it both of his arms was bret 
cooler?

2346
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:16,280
Yeah,

2347
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:17,290
definitely.
That was

2348
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,790
God,
I can't remember his name.

2349
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:22,350
Tall.
Do Tattoos on both arms.

2350
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:24,810
He was really touted as more of a 
Jujitsu guy.

2351
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:25,890
Jujitsu guy.
Yeah.

2352
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:27,150
He was trying to get ahold of them and 
he got.

2353
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:29,780
He got leveled.
Well Bob Lou manhandle,

2354
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:34,790
that dude.
And then he soccer kicked him back in 

2355
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:36,420
the soccer kick days and Bob Ballou 
soccer kicked him,

2356
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:39,810
like moved his whole body like a foot 
when he kicked him,

2357
01:40:39,811 --> 01:40:44,811
it was just,
it was one of the most brutal soccer 

2358
01:40:44,811 --> 01:40:45,180
kick Kaos ever.
And Baba Lou,

2359
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:47,680
that's when he first emerged onto the 
scene man.

2360
01:40:47,681 --> 01:40:50,340
And he was a dangerous motherfuckers 
still is man,

2361
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:52,340
you know,
he's been hit a bunch of times,

2362
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:55,030
has been knocked out bunch of times,
but you know,

2363
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:57,760
anybody could lose if they get caught.
We're spinning back fist like that.

2364
01:40:57,761 --> 01:41:01,420
That dude's spun around and blasted him 
right behind the jaw.

2365
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:03,670
I mean that,
that was a hot shot.

2366
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:05,330
It was.
And he was still up after that shot.

2367
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:07,060
Took it in Illinois.
Yeah.

2368
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:12,061
You got dropped by the left hook,
but you know he's been in there with so 

2369
01:41:12,061 --> 01:41:13,660
many guys like thinking about like the 
chocolate Dell,

2370
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:16,210
two fights with chuck.
You know those,

2371
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:21,240
those were crazy fight the thing.
The thing is is that the last year has 

2372
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:24,811
had have been some brutal ass shot go 
gig guard Musashi who was an animal.

2373
01:41:25,530 --> 01:41:27,700
The Henderson is one of the most brutal,
you know,

2374
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:30,760
Henry Henderson puts it on you dude.
The guy he is.

2375
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:34,480
That motherfucker has some of the most 
violent ground and pound.

2376
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:39,780
It's like he capitalizes on these 
openings in ways that a lot of guys 

2377
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:40,840
don't like.
It's the suddenness to it.

2378
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:44,620
Like when he starts pounding on you,
you usually don't get up from that.

2379
01:41:44,621 --> 01:41:47,620
It's not a lot of guys who are going to 
absorb those shots and get up.

2380
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:53,010
He can.
Dan can put some serious fucking 

2381
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:53,010
horsepower behind those Naacos.
Man.

2382
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:55,290
I'm,
I was really bummed out when they had to

2383
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,760
stop that Jon Jones Henderson fight.
I was really,

2384
01:41:57,761 --> 01:41:59,650
really bummed out because,
uh,

2385
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:04,680
I'm so,
especially during that time of his 

2386
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:08,250
career when John is like still sort of 
learning all the different aspects of 

2387
01:42:08,441 --> 01:42:13,441
mma.
I mean he's getting better every time 

2388
01:42:13,441 --> 01:42:15,361
you see him,
but if there's ever an opening for a 

2389
01:42:15,361 --> 01:42:17,821
veteran,
a real crafty guy like Anderson to 

2390
01:42:17,821 --> 01:42:20,671
capitalize on a mistake or the open,
open a door by setting some traps and 

2391
01:42:20,951 --> 01:42:25,951
open the door for him to land a punch.
Dan Henderson knows how to put that 

2392
01:42:25,951 --> 01:42:26,260
fucking hand on you.
He knows how to do it.

2393
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:30,010
He might not be technical in the sense 
of like Cyril,

2394
01:42:30,011 --> 01:42:34,020
Dod Bhate who sets things up in that 
flow through a wide variety of punches.

2395
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:35,110
It overhand right and good left hook.

2396
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:38,290
But if he hits you,
you're fucks Ville and going out.

2397
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:41,290
And he does it in training a lot too.
It's not like.

2398
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:45,790
So he's developed a way to that works 
with his body type,

2399
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:49,140
with his style of fighting and with his 
wrestling ability to.

2400
01:42:49,141 --> 01:42:52,390
He's developed a way you,
you can't sleep on that.

2401
01:42:52,391 --> 01:42:57,391
And I would have thought.
I thought that was a very interesting 

2402
01:42:57,391 --> 01:42:58,980
first round really to see what kind of,
what,

2403
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:02,500
how the fight shapes up and whether or 
not John takes him down.

2404
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:04,570
If John gets on top of him and wears 
them out.

2405
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,740
Yeah,
that's what I was.

2406
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:10,760
I was wondering like how would this play
out and what do you get clipped coming 

2407
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:10,760
in,
you know,

2408
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,630
and Dan Henderson clips you,
I don't care who you are,

2409
01:43:13,631 --> 01:43:18,280
you've got a really big problem on your 
hands and that is a career changer.

2410
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,900
It is.
That shit's a career changer.

2411
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,160
You know,
like when he blasted out fader,

2412
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:24,040
everybody was like,
Holy Shit.

2413
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:24,850
I said,
I mean,

2414
01:43:24,851 --> 01:43:29,851
look,
people have beaten fader and bigfoot 

2415
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:32,100
even stopped him in between rounds,
but it was a brutal slow beat down.

2416
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:36,010
Whereas Dan Henderson's was sudden and 
violent as fuck.

2417
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:41,220
He ducks under and clips him with an 
upper cut under his armpit and just 

2418
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,660
starches.
I'm just stiffens him up and then boom,

2419
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:46,360
boom.
A couple hammers to the side of the head

2420
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:47,500
and it's over.
I mean,

2421
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:49,330
when,
when Dan gets you hurt,

2422
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,320
he fucking jumped on and they're never 
the same.

2423
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:52,320
Never says

2424
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,530
Dan Henderson fought,
I think it was,

2425
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:59,620
I mean,
Cro cop probably beat the crap out of 

2426
01:43:59,620 --> 01:43:59,620
annually.
But after,

2427
01:43:59,620 --> 01:43:59,620
in my opinion,
after the,

2428
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:00,710
uh,
den Henderson fight,

2429
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:02,270
when he lost his belt and pride,
I was pretty much it.

2430
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:04,340
Vandelay was never that old vander Lee 
again.

2431
01:44:04,341 --> 01:44:05,480
Ever,
ever.

2432
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:06,970
I think cro cop beat the crew.
Adam Cro,

2433
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:08,890
cro,
cop speed to Kao.

2434
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,150
First of all,
when they first fought cro,

2435
01:44:11,151 --> 01:44:13,220
cop cro,
cop beat his body up,

2436
01:44:13,221 --> 01:44:18,221
but some of the most vicious fucking 
left kicks to the body where that 

2437
01:44:18,221 --> 01:44:19,700
footprint ribs,
this whole ribs were lit up.

2438
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:23,750
But he was so inexperienced that his 
timing was a bit off.

2439
01:44:23,751 --> 01:44:28,751
He was worried about the takedown and 
even instilled some weird law or rule 

2440
01:44:28,751 --> 01:44:29,990
rather where you can only find in the 
ground for like 30 seconds.

2441
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:34,100
Remember those old mixed k ones with 
pride.

2442
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,920
And the rule was that if no one got 
knocked out,

2443
01:44:36,921 --> 01:44:37,700
it would be a draw.

2444
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:42,770
So wound up being a draw.
But in the second fight you saw cro cop 

2445
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:46,640
where to have quite a few mma fights and
quite a few days in the gym.

2446
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:51,820
Working on a sprawl and his take down 
the fence and that was when he was in 

2447
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:51,820
his athletic,
at his best.

2448
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:54,650
He was at his best and when he fucking 
Shinde him in the head man,

2449
01:44:54,651 --> 01:44:55,880
like,
oh Geez.

2450
01:44:55,881 --> 01:45:00,881
And you saw it vandelay just go 
backwards with his arms up in the air 

2451
01:45:00,881 --> 01:45:01,680
completely in dreamland.
You're like,

2452
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:06,700
whoa.
I didn't think we'd see vandelay like 

2453
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:06,700
this.
When you see enough fights,

2454
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,630
especially somebody with a long career 
like vandelay or cro cop,

2455
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:12,920
and then you guys can always say one 
fight where you kind of go.

2456
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:14,730
That was it,
you know,

2457
01:45:14,731 --> 01:45:18,290
and I think was the high point for him.
I think it's Mark Hunt really.

2458
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:21,080
I think Mark Hunt hurt him and he lost 
that fight.

2459
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,370
We thought he won that fight,
but if anyone that fit,

2460
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:25,970
I thought he wanted to,
but it was a close fight.

2461
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:28,150
Mark Hunt hurt him,
knocked him down.

2462
01:45:28,710 --> 01:45:33,710
And Mark,
I think Mark Hunt took some of the wind 

2463
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:37,421
out of his sails.
Vandelay always thought of himself as a 

2464
01:45:37,421 --> 01:45:40,631
striker and that was the first time he 
faced a guy who is like ridiculously 

2465
01:45:40,631 --> 01:45:41,240
pedigreed striker,
k,

2466
01:45:41,241 --> 01:45:44,320
one Grand Prix champion and Mark Hunt 
when they were standing,

2467
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:45,620
Mark Hunt was putting it on them.
Yeah,

2468
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:50,621
I think vandelay realizing its head like
I'm not even close to the best striker 

2469
01:45:50,621 --> 01:45:53,981
on earth.
I think that fight shattered his 

2470
01:45:53,981 --> 01:45:53,981
confidence a little bit without 
conferences.

2471
01:45:53,981 --> 01:45:54,290
Got like generally can't do any.
Yeah,

2472
01:45:54,291 --> 01:45:56,270
because that was the first fight when we
saw him,

2473
01:45:56,271 --> 01:46:01,271
like consistently not able to do what he
wanted to do with his stand up and 

2474
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:03,870
getting teed off on.
He got tagged a couple of times.

2475
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:08,880
I don't just take down a lot,
which we never saw him before that he 

2476
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:12,221
tried to turn it into an mma fight and 
we thought from vandelay that he would 

2477
01:46:12,221 --> 01:46:16,391
welcome a brawl,
but he did not welcome abroad with that 

2478
01:46:16,391 --> 01:46:16,391
guy.
And I think that was one of those fights

2479
01:46:16,391 --> 01:46:20,441
where you know,
you look at like a guy operating like 

2480
01:46:20,441 --> 01:46:23,201
vander Lee did it.
So many Rpms like hit the folks who've 

2481
01:46:23,201 --> 01:46:25,991
never seen beverly's fights is his name 
is spelled Wanderlei w a n d e r Lei,

2482
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:31,610
and he was like ridiculous to her with 
this nickname.

2483
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:35,090
Does it already that nicknamed him that?
I think so,

2484
01:46:35,091 --> 01:46:35,780
yeah.
Pretty.

2485
01:46:35,781 --> 01:46:37,820
Had a bunch of great nicknames,
but he,

2486
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:39,010
um,
whoever it was,

2487
01:46:39,011 --> 01:46:42,650
that nickname that was perfect because 
he would fight like a murderer.

2488
01:46:42,651 --> 01:46:44,990
He would just come charging at you like 
a fucking animal.

2489
01:46:44,991 --> 01:46:49,991
He scared the shit out of everybody 
being like he was the most aggressive 

2490
01:46:49,991 --> 01:46:50,350
guy ever in a sport

2491
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:52,810
that's unbelievably aggressive from an 
aggressive camp.

2492
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:53,910
Yeah.
Box for that.

2493
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:55,720
And he was like the poster boy for shoot
box.

2494
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,350
Yeah,
he was.

2495
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:58,420
When he was in his prime,
he was insane.

2496
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:03,630
Watch if you want to watch him in his 
prime watch vandelay Silva versus 

2497
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:07,591
Quintin Jackson and pride.
When you see vandelay Silva versus 

2498
01:47:07,591 --> 01:47:11,131
Quintin in the UFC,
he'd already been flatlined a couple 

2499
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:11,131
times.
Cro Cop at Kod,

2500
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:15,580
Dan Henderson and coyote.
Him fighter can only take so many shots 

2501
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:17,530
to the head.
There's only so many you have in you and

2502
01:47:17,531 --> 01:47:19,780
vandelay eats up a lot of those in 
training,

2503
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:22,210
you know,
like vandelay and training is calling

2504
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:27,780
a problem with that.
Sometimes that shoe box mentalities you 

2505
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:27,780
use all your juice up training spawn 
with guys.

2506
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:28,810
This is the other one.

2507
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:34,360
Trainings are ridiculous.
They had a bet to see who would win a 

2508
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,790
fight for a pit bull.
Vandelay wanted to buy a pit bull from a

2509
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:41,820
Shogun shogun wanted too much money or 
whatever they thought vandelay knocked 

2510
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:47,251
him out and took his pit bull.
He knocked his friend for a fucking 

2511
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:49,300
puppy.
It like that shoot box man.

2512
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,810
And even in,
you know,

2513
01:47:50,811 --> 01:47:52,900
to this day Shogun even talks about,
you know,

2514
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:55,390
that kind of training that they don't do
that anymore.

2515
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,400
That kind of training is bad for the 
athletes.

2516
01:47:57,401 --> 01:48:00,440
So shogun is not participating in that 
kind of training as much.

2517
01:48:00,441 --> 01:48:00,580
Anyway.

2518
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,020
I think hearkening back to what we're 
talking about about it's a sport,

2519
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:08,060
athletes now there's that the 
intelligence of we are professional 

2520
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:10,260
athletes and I want to have a long 
career to make money.

2521
01:48:10,261 --> 01:48:13,380
It isn't so much the pride of the 
martial artists like it used to be,

2522
01:48:13,381 --> 01:48:18,381
which has its ups and downs,
but part of the good side is they're 

2523
01:48:18,381 --> 01:48:21,261
athletes and they're thinking about 
their career and I think about the 

2524
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:21,720
longterm of training and rest and that 
wasn't always a factor.

2525
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:22,560
Needless to say,

2526
01:48:23,740 --> 01:48:28,690
the most important aspect of MMA for 
progress is analysis,

2527
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:31,930
analysis,
objectivity and intelligence focus,

2528
01:48:31,931 --> 01:48:33,520
dedication,
hard work and techniques.

2529
01:48:33,521 --> 01:48:38,521
Having all of those info in place,
you have to be able to analyze what you 

2530
01:48:38,521 --> 01:48:42,781
need to change,
what you need to adjust and what you 

2531
01:48:42,781 --> 01:48:42,781
need to put in and what you need to take
out.

2532
01:48:42,781 --> 01:48:44,200
That's all technique.
That's being technical,

2533
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:49,350
that's being intelligent and when you 
get to a point where you're ultimately 

2534
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:52,621
technical,
like a guy like Anderson Silva who's 

2535
01:48:52,621 --> 01:48:54,190
technique is so evolved and so far 
behind or so far ahead of everybody that

2536
01:48:54,191 --> 01:48:59,191
he can do.
Nobody shit like standing with his back 

2537
01:48:59,191 --> 01:48:59,191
up against the cage and go,
come on,

2538
01:48:59,191 --> 01:48:59,191
come on,
come,

2539
01:48:59,191 --> 01:49:03,250
come fight with me.
And Stephan Bonner was so far beyond his

2540
01:49:03,251 --> 01:49:08,251
reach with it in terms of technique that
Anderson can get away with that kind of 

2541
01:49:08,251 --> 01:49:10,220
shit.
You stand right in front of you dodger,

2542
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:12,190
your obvious punches.
There's a president,

2543
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:16,100
there's a point every fighter goes to 
where that you don't want to go there.

2544
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:21,130
It's a dark place.
You've got to face sometimes to know 

2545
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:22,870
here's the best and here's where I am.
Yeah.

2546
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:24,990
And I'm not there and I'm never going to
be there.

2547
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:26,370
And that's,
that's how it is.

2548
01:49:26,371 --> 01:49:28,350
And you see every there,
there are a lot of fighters.

2549
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,840
The whole point of fighting any athletic
competitions to go,

2550
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:33,770
how good can I be at this?
How far can I get with everything I get?

2551
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,740
There was a point where you go this far.
Yeah,

2552
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:40,740
the Anderson Silva is the best and he's 
making me look like an idiot.

2553
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,440
It's pretty far below.
That's a hard thing to see

2554
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,990
was just really,
you know,

2555
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:48,580
like everyone likes to say you can.
Anything you set your mind to.

2556
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,260
Yeah.
Sort of.

2557
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:54,670
Unless John Jones is set in his mind to 
doing it too and then doing it alone,

2558
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:58,180
just what you might not be able to do it
because John John's my fuck you up.

2559
01:49:58,270 --> 01:49:58,960
You know,
you could say,

2560
01:49:58,961 --> 01:50:00,190
well,
you want to be the champion.

2561
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:02,040
You can go and set your mind,
eh,

2562
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:04,210
John John's centers might do it too.
Okay,

2563
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:09,211
and he's.
He's way ahead of you and the physical 

2564
01:50:09,211 --> 01:50:11,200
curve and that physical curve is so real
and if you don't have the physical gifts

2565
01:50:11,201 --> 01:50:14,500
to go along with the dedication and the 
athleticism and the training,

2566
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:17,260
most likely you're not going to be 
successful anymore.

2567
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:19,450
There's a.
We live in a different era now.

2568
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:22,240
It's not as simple.
It's not as simple as the old days,

2569
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:27,480
but the key to getting anything out of 
martial arts is to maximize what you're 

2570
01:50:27,971 --> 01:50:31,720
personally capable of and maximize your 
human potential.

2571
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:36,990
It doesn't mean that everybody who gets 
into martial arts has to be a UFC or a 

2572
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:38,020
belt or champion.
That's fucking stupid.

2573
01:50:38,350 --> 01:50:39,190
Like,
that's crazy.

2574
01:50:39,191 --> 01:50:41,080
So to think that,
you know,

2575
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:44,620
it's sad that someone can't make a 
career as a UFC fighter.

2576
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:47,230
No.
Most people can't make a career as a UFC

2577
01:50:47,231 --> 01:50:49,720
fighter.
Not everyone can be champion.

2578
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:52,480
Maybe you can.
Maybe you can't.

2579
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:57,400
Maybe it's a combination of you need to 
be prepared from the right point in your

2580
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:59,830
life,
in the correct way,

2581
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:04,831
and managed in the right forms of 
competition so you experienced defeat 

2582
01:51:04,831 --> 01:51:09,631
and experience all the benefits of 
facing adversity or you might not.

2583
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:12,220
You might hurt your back,
you know,

2584
01:51:12,221 --> 01:51:17,221
you might.
You live fucking me up and you can't 

2585
01:51:17,221 --> 01:51:19,171
compete anymore,
but you have to take whatever energy 

2586
01:51:19,171 --> 01:51:22,681
that allowed you to get very good at 
martial arts and use that in some other 

2587
01:51:22,681 --> 01:51:24,280
way and learn and let you've developed 
tools.

2588
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:29,280
You have a whole box full of shit that 
you've developed through overcoming 

2589
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:33,481
adversity that the average person 
doesn't and you can apply that to 

2590
01:51:33,481 --> 01:51:34,210
anything you want.
Your sporting life.

2591
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:39,270
Yeah,
is six to 10 years if you are real 

2592
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:39,310
lucky.
If you aren't sure Josh Barnett,

2593
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:41,380
unless you're in forever,
sorry,

2594
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:46,060
v toward knocks out bisping and he's.
He started out 1997,

2595
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:48,340
1997 and he's still at the top of the 
game.

2596
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:52,090
A long prime.
That's 13 years and he's a striker,

2597
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:54,820
which is even crazier.
Christian even make any sense.

2598
01:51:55,130 --> 01:52:00,130
I could be that that deep in the game 
still keep his chin and still start 

2599
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:03,460
people on a regular basis and because 
he's had hand problems,

2600
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,210
you know,
he's broken his hand like eight blocks.

2601
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:08,200
He's moved to kick and people.
Now he's head kicking people.

2602
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:10,000
I mean,
and with the same kind of speed known as

2603
01:52:10,001 --> 01:52:10,360
a punter.

2604
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:11,140
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2605
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:13,510
But the thing that you're like your 
athletic prime,

2606
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:18,511
unless you're.
Unless you're a brown hopkins or 

2607
01:52:18,511 --> 01:52:18,511
something is generally 10 years is a 
long time.

2608
01:52:18,511 --> 01:52:19,900
How much hgh has he taken?
Let's be honest.

2609
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:23,520
There has to be some hgh,
little testosterone cream.

2610
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:24,700
Not out there.
There's just.

2611
01:52:24,701 --> 01:52:28,210
I don't see unless he some genetic freak
specimen,

2612
01:52:28,211 --> 01:52:33,211
but it doesn't make any sense anymore.
The fact that you'd be athletically 

2613
01:52:33,211 --> 01:52:36,061
competitive in his age.
I think the last guy to do it legit was 

2614
01:52:36,061 --> 01:52:39,301
George Foreman.
I think George Foreman and and not want 

2615
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:40,150
to cast aspersions on anybody for taking
performance enhancing supplements,

2616
01:52:40,151 --> 01:52:42,670
but we know that they do.
We know that they do.

2617
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,450
It's 100 percent that there are certain 
athletes,

2618
01:52:45,451 --> 01:52:48,150
whether it's in boxing or MMA or in 
whatever.

2619
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:52,050
This Lance Armstrong thing,
man drives me fucking crazy.

2620
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:56,220
I say that the real issue with Lance 
Armstrong was it,

2621
01:52:56,221 --> 01:53:01,221
he's a hypocrite Douche bag and he was a
Douche bag to the people that were 

2622
01:53:01,221 --> 01:53:03,540
riding with him and he was a Douche bag 
to the people that held at

2623
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:08,760
grits about blood doping and everyone 
I've spoken to who's dealt with them 

2624
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:08,760
terrible human being.
He's a cunt.

2625
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:09,590
So we all say

2626
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:14,910
Lance Armstrong's a con,
but why is he illegit and the other 

2627
01:53:15,881 --> 01:53:16,900
guys,
are they legit?

2628
01:53:16,901 --> 01:53:19,090
Like if you take away his title,
who wins?

2629
01:53:19,091 --> 01:53:20,000
That thing is

2630
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:22,160
no winner of the Tour de France.
You know,

2631
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:23,900
they,
they couldn't find anyone.

2632
01:53:23,901 --> 01:53:25,460
They couldn't.
What happened was they went down,

2633
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,530
they had all dope too.
So they went,

2634
01:53:27,650 --> 01:53:28,810
all right,
so there's no winner for these.

2635
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:32,480
17 said for the year and you had to go 
all the way back.

2636
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:37,680
10th place to a guy who is this?
A Kalyan dude who had never been accused

2637
01:53:38,081 --> 01:53:43,060
or thought of as a doper and never 
tested positive 10th place 10th.

2638
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:46,720
You have a legitimate sport man,
and you know it's some doctors say ready

2639
01:53:46,721 --> 01:53:51,721
for this.
They say that it's healthy to take epo 

2640
01:53:51,721 --> 01:53:55,740
and to take blood transfusions and to 
take human growth hormone and take 

2641
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:56,170
testosterone.
If you're going to do something like the

2642
01:53:56,170 --> 01:53:57,340
Tour de France because it's unhealthy,

2643
01:53:57,460 --> 01:54:02,460
do it without those things that you're 
telling your body to go way beyond its 

2644
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:02,460
normal limits.
Way Beyond.

2645
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:07,400
Come on.
You're telling your body to go way 

2646
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:07,400
beyond its normal way beyond.
It's boring as fuck.

2647
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:11,800
How about that?
Somebody ride a bike or what?

2648
01:54:11,801 --> 01:54:13,420
Riding a bike.
I'm sure it's thrilling.

2649
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:15,010
I'm sure it's great.
Great

2650
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:19,810
to to enforce your willpower and your 
determination and the amount of time you

2651
01:54:19,811 --> 01:54:24,811
spend on the road.
Just pushing and checking your heart 

2652
01:54:24,811 --> 01:54:24,820
rate monitor and to know that you're 
beating this guy with your discipline,

2653
01:54:24,821 --> 01:54:26,920
your hard work and your will to win and 
all that good.

2654
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,230
However,
nobody wants to watch that shit.

2655
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:31,210
You're riding a fucking bike.
Okay?

2656
01:54:31,211 --> 01:54:33,360
You little kid.
Get the fuck Outta here.

2657
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,380
Putting breeding.
Nobody's,

2658
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:36,600
nobody's going to watch a sport where 
you're,

2659
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:37,780
your bell.
Sounds like this.

2660
01:54:39,730 --> 01:54:42,980
Do not have those bells.
They don't have those bells.

2661
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:48,410
She'd have this baseball cards and their
wheels and they should all have those 

2662
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:49,810
bells bringing.
You're a little child,

2663
01:54:49,811 --> 01:54:51,850
Lance Armstrong,
but it's the old guy on a bike.

2664
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:54,320
What's cheating?
If everybody's doing it,

2665
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:57,750
everybody's doing it was cheating.
It becomes a very real question.

2666
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,410
Like they're.
The real issue is at what is allowed.

2667
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:04,510
Can you take vitamins?
Yes,

2668
01:55:04,511 --> 01:55:05,000
you can.
Well,

2669
01:55:05,001 --> 01:55:10,001
why can you take vitamins?
Why shouldn't you just get everything 

2670
01:55:10,001 --> 01:55:12,841
you need through your healthy diet?
Because what are you getting out of 

2671
01:55:12,841 --> 01:55:15,631
those vitamins?
Have you taking more vitamin C than you 

2672
01:55:15,631 --> 01:55:18,931
could ever get by eating food?
Is there a benefit in that and what 

2673
01:55:18,931 --> 01:55:18,931
isn't?
Is it show up athletically?

2674
01:55:18,931 --> 01:55:20,560
And why should you be able to do that?
I mean,

2675
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:22,030
I'm just using that as an example,

2676
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:22,450
right?
Well,

2677
01:55:22,451 --> 01:55:23,200
there was,
there was,

2678
01:55:23,201 --> 01:55:24,250
uh,
some,

2679
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:29,251
uh,
supplement that mark mcgwire they found 

2680
01:55:29,251 --> 01:55:29,710
in his locker when he was doing,
based on what you guys remember,

2681
01:55:29,711 --> 01:55:30,600
that it's interesting,
Diane,

2682
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:32,950
I understand.
And somebody,

2683
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:35,740
an Olympic athlete got banned for life 
for that stuff,

2684
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:38,470
but baseball didn't recognize it as a 
banned substance.

2685
01:55:38,471 --> 01:55:39,460
So he was taking it.
He was saying,

2686
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:42,130
I can totally take it.
They were called pro hormones,

2687
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:42,760
right?
And this was,

2688
01:55:42,761 --> 01:55:44,070
there was a bunch of them that

2689
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:49,100
will totally work legit.
One of them was called Mag 10 and they 

2690
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:52,440
made this shit illegal.
Do this was fucking steroids.

2691
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:54,480
It was steroids.
I took it,

2692
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:57,020
my nipples hurt.
I got way bigger,

2693
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:01,770
gained like 10 pounds in a no bullshit,
maybe two months,

2694
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:03,810
two months,
10 pounds of muscle.

2695
01:56:03,811 --> 01:56:06,630
And it was amazing.
And you got it at GNC.

2696
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:09,720
The only problem was when you got off 
that your Dick said cyanotic.

2697
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:12,930
My Dick was like,
dude,

2698
01:56:12,931 --> 01:56:16,200
I'm going to take about a month or start
working in a inverted.

2699
01:56:16,201 --> 01:56:17,280
So I was like,
I was.

2700
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:19,530
I remember beating off with a half hard 
deck.

2701
01:56:19,531 --> 01:56:24,531
I'm like,
I have in common like four days and I 

2702
01:56:24,531 --> 01:56:24,531
still can't get a boner.
My Dick was done for.

2703
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:26,010
Yeah,
it took a while.

2704
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:29,670
Took like it was like at least a couple 
of weeks,

2705
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:34,990
like before I felt like normal again 
because you were so elevated that your 

2706
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:36,120
balls are like,
what are you doing?

2707
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,600
I just want you to take and stuff.
I fought a GNC.

2708
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:45,260
GNC used to sell.
They used to sell 'em that date rape 

2709
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:45,780
shit.
I'm Ghb.

2710
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:50,810
Yeah.
They used to this stuff that's built by 

2711
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:51,850
people overdose on and people throw in 
girls drinks and molest them.

2712
01:56:51,950 --> 01:56:56,950
Used to be able to buy that at GNC.
GNC has had some legit shit there.

2713
01:56:57,421 --> 01:56:59,190
Over the years.
That button,

2714
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,980
I never took anything that was as strong
as that mag 10 stuff.

2715
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:04,560
That was.
You had to take a lot of pills to like.

2716
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:09,561
You couldn't be even remotely confused 
as to whether or not you're doing 

2717
01:57:09,561 --> 01:57:13,131
something healthy because you were 
taking like 10 of these foul pills a 

2718
01:57:13,131 --> 01:57:13,860
day.
It was like a lot of pills.

2719
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:15,840
I'm like,
what is the oral toxicity of this stuff?

2720
01:57:15,841 --> 01:57:17,370
Like what is it,
what's it doing to my liver?

2721
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:18,270
Who Cares?

2722
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:22,980
Just make you giant.
So they got rid of that.

2723
01:57:22,981 --> 01:57:24,390
That became illegal,
which is a,

2724
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:29,870
I think probably a good thing because 
anybody like me can just go in and buy 

2725
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:32,430
it and like you don't,
you don't know like if you're like an 18

2726
01:57:32,431 --> 01:57:37,431
year old guy and you take that stuff.
Like I took it for what it said to take 

2727
01:57:37,431 --> 01:57:38,190
on the package.
I took it for like six weeks or whatever

2728
01:57:38,191 --> 01:57:39,900
it said to take.
But what if you're an idiot?

2729
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:44,160
What if you take it every day for a year
and then all of a sudden you're,

2730
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:47,010
you have like cancer,
like your body shuts down.

2731
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:47,700
Like you're,
you know,

2732
01:57:47,701 --> 01:57:50,760
you have like liver issues or you might 
get asked to get a transplant.

2733
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:55,890
One of prescription medication is that a
doctor tells you how often to take it 

2734
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:56,160
and he can only take it for a certain 
amount of time.

2735
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:01,160
It's the whole point.
You shouldn't be able to just buy 

2736
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,760
something in Gnc that can jack,
you know it.

2737
01:58:02,761 --> 01:58:06,030
It shouldn't be possible.
Should be like buying calcium.

2738
01:58:06,031 --> 01:58:06,900
Well,
you take it,

2739
01:58:06,901 --> 01:58:10,200
what happens if you take too much?
You know,

2740
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:12,000
like who cares?
Just be fine,

2741
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:15,240
but if you take like some of those like 
mag 10 type things,

2742
01:58:15,241 --> 01:58:17,670
like you could shut your whole endocrine
system.

2743
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:18,510
Done.
Yeah.

2744
01:58:18,511 --> 01:58:20,280
You're whole.
You're fucking pituitary glands.

2745
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:25,281
Like what are you doing asshole?
Like your body doesn't know what to do 

2746
01:58:25,281 --> 01:58:28,431
without your gonads shrink.
Like I know a dude who is maybe in his 

2747
01:58:28,431 --> 01:58:32,721
thirties and he cannot have a child.
He's trying to have a child with his 

2748
01:58:32,721 --> 01:58:35,100
girlfriend and his wife now.
They can't.

2749
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:40,130
They can't have a child.
And so they went to the doctor and the 

2750
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:43,041
doctor said,
did you have a sperm count of a 70 year 

2751
01:58:43,041 --> 01:58:43,041
old man?
You just,

2752
01:58:43,041 --> 01:58:44,980
you broke your Dick,
you broke it.

2753
01:58:45,110 --> 01:58:48,820
It's all broken now because he was a 
bodybuilder when he was young.

2754
01:58:48,850 --> 01:58:53,850
Apparently it was gigantic at one point.
That candle that Burns twice as bright 

2755
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:54,460
burns half as long.
That's it,

2756
01:58:54,461 --> 01:58:55,350
dude.
No candle.

2757
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:58,360
If you make yourself do something 
extraordinary,

2758
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:01,810
it makes your body go beyond its limits 
for too long.

2759
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:04,900
It comes back way lower than it.
Then it went in.

2760
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:07,030
That's why it's fast in the natural.
It's the way it goes,

2761
01:59:07,031 --> 01:59:12,031
man.
See Bodybuilding change from like the 

2762
01:59:12,031 --> 01:59:12,031
uh,
what is his name?

2763
01:59:12,031 --> 01:59:14,920
Reeves Day was that guy's name George 
[inaudible] or Steve Back in the day.

2764
01:59:14,921 --> 01:59:16,480
Yeah.
I mean they were like,

2765
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:17,780
you know,
they were built like,

2766
01:59:17,781 --> 01:59:19,090
um,
like when you have a comic books,

2767
01:59:19,091 --> 01:59:20,700
so they went like,
it would be able to like,

2768
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:22,720
you know,
Charles Atlas?

2769
01:59:22,721 --> 01:59:24,340
Yeah.
They were like solid,

2770
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:26,170
you know,
powerful looking men.

2771
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:31,410
But they weren't like these weird skin 
tight vascular freak alien looking dudes

2772
01:59:33,881 --> 01:59:38,881
that you see today where they,
there's a picture of this guy flexing 

2773
01:59:38,881 --> 01:59:39,530
his ass and his ass looks like.

2774
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:42,550
It's like,
it looks like ropes.

2775
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:47,700
It looks like someone's taken some giant
like shipyard rope and made an ass out 

2776
01:59:48,071 --> 01:59:51,340
of it.
Like it's all coordinated and if the guy

2777
01:59:51,341 --> 01:59:54,180
has no body fat on,
like it can't be healthy there,

2778
01:59:54,181 --> 01:59:56,320
but I probably can't even walk up a 
flight of stairs.

2779
01:59:56,321 --> 01:59:57,400
He was ready to die.
I don't,

2780
01:59:57,410 --> 01:59:59,440
I don't get about bodybuilding 
seriously.

2781
01:59:59,441 --> 02:00:00,130
I don't.
Why?

2782
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:03,070
Why?
The mentality of bodybuilding kind of is

2783
02:00:03,071 --> 02:00:08,071
when is it okay,
I'm good now because it's like finding 

2784
02:00:08,071 --> 02:00:11,611
is my.
If I train hard enough to beat this guy 

2785
02:00:11,611 --> 02:00:11,611
and if I did that,
I train hard enough.

2786
02:00:11,611 --> 02:00:15,630
Right?
If it's my ass doesn't look enough like 

2787
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:18,121
a rope or whatever,
like when there's no clinical and the 

2788
02:00:18,121 --> 02:00:18,190
bargain.
Just do a drop.

2789
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:19,240
Yeah.
Your bar barking.

2790
02:00:19,241 --> 02:00:20,620
Just go up and up and up.
I don't get that.

2791
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:25,710
Well,
you go back and look at all arnold who 

2792
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:28,560
was a fucking petri dish of chemicals,
like self admitted that he took steroids

2793
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:34,740
and you look at it when you see him but 
was nowhere near big enough to compete 

2794
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:34,740
today.

2795
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,220
Dorian Yates,
guys,

2796
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:41,980
all those guys.
Just unbelievably big.

2797
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:47,270
There's,
there's guys today that they don't even 

2798
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:47,590
look real.
They don't look real.

2799
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:50,320
So you look at our old,
like back in the day when he was.

2800
02:00:50,321 --> 02:00:52,540
He was more like a Greek God.
Yeah.

2801
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:55,750
It was way lean but still filled with 
roids.

2802
02:00:55,780 --> 02:01:00,780
Yup.
It's like the changing of the 

2803
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:02,890
perspective of like what we think of is 
a big muscular man.

2804
02:01:02,891 --> 02:01:06,880
Like now it's like cartoonish.
Unachievable Shit,

2805
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:10,420
it's like you saw like Franco Columbo,
that's a perfect example.

2806
02:01:10,421 --> 02:01:13,030
Like that is reachable I think without 
steroids.

2807
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:16,720
I think with great genetics or Frank 
Zane even better example.

2808
02:01:16,721 --> 02:01:17,890
Yeah.
Frank Zane was.

2809
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:20,260
He looked like a lean,
athletic,

2810
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:23,590
muscular,
well proportioned guy.

2811
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:26,740
He looked achievable.
He had a normal size neck.

2812
02:01:26,741 --> 02:01:29,470
He had a normal sized set of shoulders.
It was achievable.

2813
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:33,800
Whereas a guy like Dorian Yates looked 
like it was going to expose us.

2814
02:01:33,850 --> 02:01:35,290
Look like the hulk,
dude.

2815
02:01:35,291 --> 02:01:40,291
I just explode onstage.
Flex sport freaks me out of all the 

2816
02:01:41,361 --> 02:01:44,090
crazy shit.
I have seen an MMA combat sports.

2817
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:47,630
I can't watch powerlifting.
Oh,

2818
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:52,660
because I just wait for that moment.
Which does happen sometimes when the 

2819
02:01:52,660 --> 02:01:54,140
need just explodes.
A hand grenade,

2820
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:56,560
man,
when these guys are power cleaning,

2821
02:01:57,140 --> 02:02:00,020
just ungodly weight and your back just 
goes.

2822
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:03,210
It just turns to powder like you're done
and posted.

2823
02:02:03,211 --> 02:02:05,150
This goes bad.
It goes so bad.

2824
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:07,580
I cannot watch it.
It's horrible to watch any,

2825
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:08,060
any.
If you.

2826
02:02:08,061 --> 02:02:12,280
Especially if you're on espn two in the 
morning when the top of their head,

2827
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:15,320
the fucking cliff and it lands in their 
head.

2828
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:21,040
Here's a whole bad hosted,
a threat on the underground about 

2829
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:21,040
rolfing.
Look,

2830
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:24,791
if anybody had back issues.
I was saying I'm having some success 

2831
02:02:24,791 --> 02:02:27,401
with this.
She's tried out and someone posted an 

2832
02:02:27,401 --> 02:02:29,501
animated Gif of this kid,
really skinny kid and he gets into a 

2833
02:02:29,501 --> 02:02:33,341
Smith machine,
has got all this weight on and he curls 

2834
02:02:33,341 --> 02:02:36,251
it back to release it and then drops 
straight down on his neck is like knee,

2835
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:43,220
knee is touching face and the bars on 
top of his neck.

2836
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:46,280
I don't even know if he lived.
It's horrific to watch,

2837
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:49,280
but these motherfuckers,
they post that in these threads and they

2838
02:02:49,281 --> 02:02:51,290
don't even let you know if they're going
to post something like that.

2839
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:53,600
So you like scroll down and then you're 
like,

2840
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:56,630
why the changes you dead?
Kind of like this video.

2841
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:00,380
Well this is the video.
The Bulgarian guy who was a politician,

2842
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:02,360
someone tried to assassinate him.
Check this out.

2843
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:02,740
Yeah.

2844
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:09,810
Oh my God.

2845
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:13,080
Jammed.
He stepped up,

2846
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:15,010
put the gun to his face.
Wow.

2847
02:03:15,011 --> 02:03:16,330
That guy.
Dude,

2848
02:03:16,331 --> 02:03:18,460
that guy had some crazy eyes,
man.

2849
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:21,580
Look at this guy's eyes

2850
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:22,400
right here.

2851
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,030
Tried to reload it and it's tried to 
unjam it didn't work.

2852
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:31,720
Then they played.
Let's beat the guy up for an hour.

2853
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:34,480
No Man.
It looked out calm.

2854
02:03:34,481 --> 02:03:36,190
The Guy Swat away the gun.
Oh,

2855
02:03:36,191 --> 02:03:37,880
they beat him up for an hour.
They're just.

2856
02:03:37,930 --> 02:03:40,420
All these old men are just like fucking 
beating the fuck out of it.

2857
02:03:43,690 --> 02:03:45,880
What are they saying?
I wish I knew what they were saying.

2858
02:03:46,270 --> 02:03:49,630
I think the translation is kick him.
Kick him out,

2859
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:51,100
kick him.
Love Bulgaria.

2860
02:03:51,101 --> 02:03:56,101
Also,
I want to move and I think this is a 

2861
02:03:56,101 --> 02:03:56,410
peace conference.
They had that in America.

2862
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,650
Kick his ass.
See,

2863
02:03:59,651 --> 02:04:02,050
I would not be able to stop myself from 
breaking his arms.

2864
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:04,810
I got to dude's arm back there and he 
just tried to assassinate someone.

2865
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:09,890
I'm going to break into this fucker.
He cannot show that I'm snapping your 

2866
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:10,000
shoulder.
Pulling his pants down.

2867
02:04:10,001 --> 02:04:10,970
Then they're going to shove something 
up.

2868
02:04:10,971 --> 02:04:13,470
Is that I would shoot him in the ass 
hole right in the asshole.

2869
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:16,030
Take his gun where they've given him a 
Wedgie.

2870
02:04:16,350 --> 02:04:18,820
I would take his gun and shoot him in 
the asshole on TV.

2871
02:04:18,821 --> 02:04:19,870
I'm like,
we're all cool with this,

2872
02:04:19,871 --> 02:04:20,640
right?
I'm just gonna.

2873
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:23,290
Shoot him in his ass hole right up 
through the asshole.

2874
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:25,300
How many people have died that way?
Probably a lot.

2875
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:27,660
Like how many guys?
What's your definition of?

2876
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:32,730
A lot more than a million in the time 
that we've had guns that millions of 

2877
02:04:33,941 --> 02:04:34,880
lives.
Millions of lives.

2878
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:38,900
More than 100.
That's crazy.

2879
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:42,030
That dude attacked them,
attacked him.

2880
02:04:42,031 --> 02:04:44,310
He didn't just stand there,
but he went with the push.

2881
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:49,560
Would have been great if he killed them.
How about if the old dude head kicks 

2882
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:52,231
from right here?
That is the old dude touches the gun 

2883
02:04:52,231 --> 02:04:54,610
with his left and then fucking Liotta 
Machida's and with the right high cap.

2884
02:04:54,611 --> 02:04:59,611
Some great security by the way,
and whatever cost you that as you walk 

2885
02:04:59,611 --> 02:05:02,421
up to a guy giving a speech and put a 
gun to his outstanding secret service or

2886
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:06,480
the PPK.
A little tiny ass gun.

2887
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:07,740
Yeah,
that was a.

2888
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:10,200
that's a little fucking banana republic 
right there.

2889
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:12,120
That is hilarious.
The guy shot him.

2890
02:05:12,121 --> 02:05:17,121
He would be king the king and they give 
him the throne.

2891
02:05:18,691 --> 02:05:22,050
Made it a molten swords,
like just like game of thrones,

2892
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:26,190
game of thrones reference,
because you haven't given anybody.

2893
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:29,220
Never do watch TV.
I'm on TV every week.

2894
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:34,380
I never watched TV.
You don't watch anything but you're on 

2895
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:34,620
TV.
You don't watch like history channel,

2896
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:36,750
swamp people.
You never seen swamp people.

2897
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:38,820
Dude,
I just don't watch a lot of TV.

2898
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:44,610
I,
I'm fascinated by a reality shows where 

2899
02:05:44,610 --> 02:05:48,171
people live and somewhere fucked up.
Like I'm fascinated by people that have 

2900
02:05:48,171 --> 02:05:51,951
to do with nature all the time.
The problem is my wife said reality TV 

2901
02:05:51,951 --> 02:05:54,981
producer,
so I just hear the backstory of all the 

2902
02:05:54,981 --> 02:05:54,981
bullshit.
It's not true,

2903
02:05:54,981 --> 02:05:59,560
you know,
but they really are killing those 

2904
02:05:59,560 --> 02:05:59,560
alligators on swamp people.
You can't get around that.

2905
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:00,870
Can I get around and I don't like 
alligators.

2906
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:04,690
I've never liked alligators.
Likes an alligator man.

2907
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:10,390
You know?
I think that people are fascinated by 

2908
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:12,501
all these animals,
but I would just rather have them all 

2909
02:06:12,501 --> 02:06:12,640
dead broke.
Extinction is asthma.

2910
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:15,600
They make good bags and Shit,
you know?

2911
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:18,070
But cons,
they're conti.

2912
02:06:18,110 --> 02:06:21,630
Old dinosaurs.
Everywhere we'd be fucked.

2913
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:23,760
This is my thought about dinosaurs.
Okay.

2914
02:06:23,761 --> 02:06:25,500
If we had dinosaurs roaming the streets,
we'd be,

2915
02:06:25,501 --> 02:06:26,730
fuck,
we don't want dinosaurs.

2916
02:06:26,731 --> 02:06:28,320
It's cool that we know what these two 
look like,

2917
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:31,260
but we don't want to back.
Alligators are fucking dinosaurs.

2918
02:06:31,290 --> 02:06:33,270
They eat people.
There was a guy who was running.

2919
02:06:33,271 --> 02:06:34,400
It was a great story.
Actually.

2920
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:36,090
It guy was running from the cops two 
years ago.

2921
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:37,710
He is in a high speed.
Chase,

2922
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:43,160
pulls the car over to the side road,
jumps off because his water like at a 

2923
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:45,240
bridge and jumps off in the water,
lands right next to an alligator.

2924
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:46,890
Alligator eats some right in front of 
the cop.

2925
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:50,150
Instantly the guy lands in the water 
shocks.

2926
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:52,020
Alligator.
Alligator grabs them,

2927
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:55,470
drags them under gator roll of death,
and that's for the cops.

2928
02:06:55,471 --> 02:07:00,471
It's like a goddamn clinics would movie.
So in that sense I liked the Indiana 

2929
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:02,340
Jones Temple of doom action.
In that sense.

2930
02:07:02,341 --> 02:07:07,341
It's cool to have.
It would be cool to have a moat if you 

2931
02:07:07,341 --> 02:07:07,740
had a big giant house and emote filled 
with her,

2932
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:10,740
but you'd want crocodiles,
but then you can't trust those moment.

2933
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,320
They'll come out and Jack you.
Dude,

2934
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:17,780
you got to provide them every now and 
then on the back yard and they'll eat a 

2935
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:21,480
dog or something called the swamp and 
like drag a little kid drowned them.

2936
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:24,720
Oh yeah.
Well I lived in Florida and I didn't see

2937
02:07:24,721 --> 02:07:29,721
it,
but I was there when a lady got her a 

2938
02:07:29,721 --> 02:07:29,721
dog.
Eaton snapped it right off the leash.

2939
02:07:29,721 --> 02:07:31,470
She had a poodle,
poodle one to the water to get some,

2940
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:36,740
you know,
get a little drink in the fucking 

2941
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:36,740
alligators was like,
bitch,

2942
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:36,740
what they do

2943
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:36,740
man.

2944
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:38,570
I just took him right into the water 
then.

2945
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:40,720
Nope.
I didn't hear of a person dying,

2946
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,460
but that's just because they didn't fuck
up.

2947
02:07:42,490 --> 02:07:47,490
I mean if you fuck up and out,
it's not like an alligator like doesn't 

2948
02:07:47,490 --> 02:07:47,770
want to eat.
You think people are kind of Nice to me.

2949
02:07:47,771 --> 02:07:49,060
You know,
it's like your,

2950
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:51,610
your reality is they don't understand 
that at all.

2951
02:07:51,611 --> 02:07:53,230
They'll eat anything that stands still.

2952
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:54,670
There is a,
there's A.

2953
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:58,150
I was down in Louisiana and I went to a 
gator farm and they said there's a,

2954
02:07:58,310 --> 02:08:03,310
they call a one foot rule.
An alligator eat anything a foot bigger 

2955
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:03,850
than it is.
If you're bigger than that,

2956
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:05,860
it can't swallow you so it doesn't 
really attack you,

2957
02:08:06,190 --> 02:08:08,170
but if you're five foot and you're six 
foot,

2958
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:13,260
it will eat you,
which is just crazy to think about 

2959
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:13,600
because I saw a lot of five foot 
alligators.

2960
02:08:13,700 --> 02:08:14,500
I saw a lot of them

2961
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:17,450
even creepier than an alligator's.
The Komodo Dragon.

2962
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:18,710
No,
I remember it was.

2963
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:23,720
It was bite the super toxic,
but you remember what the fuck is her 

2964
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:23,870
name from

2965
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:27,500
the.

2966
02:08:28,070 --> 02:08:29,500
Oh,
Sharon stone.

2967
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:30,710
Shit.
Yeah.

2968
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:34,730
Basic instinct.
Share House by a Komodo dragons.

2969
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:35,340
Dumb ass

2970
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:40,420
went into a Komodo dragon cage barefoot 
with socks on and they saw the white 

2971
02:08:41,361 --> 02:08:43,820
sock and they thought it was a rabbit 
because they feed them rabbits,

2972
02:08:44,330 --> 02:08:49,330
so he jumped on his foot.
Clamped down is a fucking real live 

2973
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:51,410
dinosaur.
It's 20 feet long.

2974
02:08:51,470 --> 02:08:56,470
Okay.
These are the biggest lizards on the 

2975
02:08:56,470 --> 02:08:56,470
planet earth and by the way,
it's got botulism and its saliva.

2976
02:08:56,540 --> 02:08:57,170
Yeah.
Scott,

2977
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:02,200
unbelievably toxic saliva,
so much so that they kill animals by 

2978
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:02,300
biting them and then following it.

2979
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:05,080
They wait around until they die.
It's horrible to watch

2980
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:07,510
water buffalo video where they do that,
this,

2981
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:12,570
this,
this Komodo dragon sneaks up on his 

2982
02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:13,330
water buffalo and just gets it on the 
leg just a little.

2983
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:16,000
And the water buffalo gets away a little
bit and then you see him like,

2984
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:21,060
Oh shit.
And they see in trying to get away a 

2985
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:21,060
little more and it's like,
oh shit.

2986
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:25,440
And then later on they edit the video 
and the Komodo dragon just eating its 

2987
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:29,130
guts,
just pulling chunks of meat off of its 

2988
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:29,130
carcass and like,

2989
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:29,130
you know,
as a,

2990
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:29,130
as a,
as an athlete,

2991
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:31,070
I don't need that.
It was a guy who trains in,

2992
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:35,980
let's say percentage wise,
myself and Joe Rogan

2993
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:40,220
can beat up 99 percent of people walking
around on the street.

2994
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:42,730
Anybody smaller than me,
but he doesn't know how to fight exactly

2995
02:09:42,731 --> 02:09:43,780
like you will fuck them up.
Right?

2996
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:48,790
So if you're not paying attention 
exactly now and you don't have the 

2997
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:49,190
letter,
we're screwed.

2998
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:51,110
And you have a cold,
crude Komodo Dragon.

2999
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:51,750
Yeah,
we fucked,

3000
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:54,380
fucked you fucked.
And you're so screwed.

3001
02:09:54,381 --> 02:09:59,381
A shark.
That friend of mine was surfing a 

3002
02:09:59,381 --> 02:09:59,381
deadline to meet you,
so a 14 foot tiger shark and he goes,

3003
02:09:59,381 --> 02:10:01,790
it went underneath my board and he's a 
good fighter man,

3004
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:03,530
and he goes,
I was like,

3005
02:10:03,770 --> 02:10:05,180
I'm screwed at that thing.
Just turns to me.

3006
02:10:05,181 --> 02:10:05,810
He goes,
ah,

3007
02:10:05,811 --> 02:10:07,880
yeah,
I think I'll eat him that I'm screwed.

3008
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,870
Just let me try it.
That's part of the natural kingdom.

3009
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:14,450
Human beings are not designed to take on
very many animals,

3010
02:10:14,451 --> 02:10:16,000
especially.
We're getting our ass man.

3011
02:10:16,190 --> 02:10:18,380
You can't even.
Oh Shit.

3012
02:10:18,450 --> 02:10:23,450
It might be able to fight off a mountain
lion if you kick him in the Dick or 

3013
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:23,450
something crazy,
you know,

3014
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:27,191
you might be able to just piss him off.
You might be able to arm drag him gifts 

3015
02:10:27,191 --> 02:10:31,061
with your back to Leo.
Can you choke a line for real?

3016
02:10:31,341 --> 02:10:36,341
I don't know,
but I mean if you scrap one of them 

3017
02:10:36,341 --> 02:10:36,341
enough where

3018
02:10:36,341 --> 02:10:36,341
he thinks it might be an issue,
he might run away,

3019
02:10:36,341 --> 02:10:37,910
but sharks aren't gonna run away to

3020
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:40,670
each you a lot of tigers,
not gonna run away.

3021
02:10:40,850 --> 02:10:43,710
No one's going to eat you.
Tigers are 1 million and oh,

3022
02:10:43,711 --> 02:10:48,030
against people.
No one's ever undefeated in a fair fight

3023
02:10:48,350 --> 02:10:50,490
and not natural geographic video with 
the guys on a,

3024
02:10:50,491 --> 02:10:54,270
on a on an elephant and you don't see 
anything.

3025
02:10:54,271 --> 02:10:56,190
You're looking at all this grass and 
they're looking for a tiger.

3026
02:10:56,191 --> 02:10:56,970
They killed some people,
whatever,

3027
02:10:57,330 --> 02:11:02,330
and you don't see anything and that 
thing leaped and I've been on the back 

3028
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:03,120
of an elephant before in India.
You're high.

3029
02:11:03,121 --> 02:11:08,121
It doesn't occur to you to someone could
jump up there and get you slashes that 

3030
02:11:08,121 --> 02:11:09,180
dude's arm severely.
He got fucked up.

3031
02:11:09,181 --> 02:11:14,181
You got fucked up,
but he stayed on the line like a 

3032
02:11:14,181 --> 02:11:14,181
gangster or stayed on the elephant or 
gangster.

3033
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:16,400
Well,
that dude.

3034
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:17,300
Yeah,
yeah.

3035
02:11:17,310 --> 02:11:21,930
Pull that video up because it's a tiger 
leaps onto India.

3036
02:11:22,030 --> 02:11:22,710
It's in India.

3037
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:24,670
We'll see what happens.
That video.

3038
02:11:24,671 --> 02:11:29,671
We'll watch the video that's not 
national geographic's on top of that 

3039
02:11:29,671 --> 02:11:29,671
shit.
I don't give a fuck.

3040
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:31,030
Pull it up.
Whatever it is.

3041
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:32,450
Want to see it right now.
Let's find out.

3042
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,210
Yeah.
Youtube has been yanking out.

3043
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:35,140
You know,
it's Hilarious,

3044
02:11:35,141 --> 02:11:40,141
but youtube,
youtube will take our videos down 

3045
02:11:40,141 --> 02:11:40,390
because we just started uploading them 
to youtube.

3046
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:45,420
If we use videos that are from youtube,
so that's like youtube a little,

3047
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:51,780
I'm a little confused.
The snake eating its own tail for a 

3048
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:55,591
copyright issue.
If you use a video that you got from 

3049
02:11:55,591 --> 02:11:57,430
Youtube and then you upload that to 
Youtube,

3050
02:11:57,670 --> 02:12:00,850
youtube is like you are infringing on 
someone's copyright and you're like,

3051
02:12:00,851 --> 02:12:01,670
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

3052
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,340
That's your.
That's your shit.

3053
02:12:03,341 --> 02:12:04,510
I got it from your site.
Like what?

3054
02:12:04,570 --> 02:12:09,570
What is happening here?
Or are you kind of the snitch or is 

3055
02:12:09,570 --> 02:12:09,750
letting them know that there's 
copyrighted material now?

3056
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:12,190
I don't think so.
I don't think that's what the issue is.

3057
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:17,220
That's weird because otherwise they 
would know that it's there from them 

3058
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:20,280
because they're some sort of thought.
The way they get it from you is like 

3059
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:23,150
they,
they like send out this Bot or you know,

3060
02:12:23,190 --> 02:12:28,190
have some program rather than analyzes 
all the youtube videos and finds out 

3061
02:12:28,190 --> 02:12:30,620
whether other's music.
And I'm finding and when it is just you,

3062
02:12:30,730 --> 02:12:32,440
this is copy written stuff,
you can't,

3063
02:12:32,470 --> 02:12:34,810
we're not going to get sued because we 
let you upload that Shit.

3064
02:12:35,020 --> 02:12:40,020
So you figured once they have something 
that's on youtube and they keep it on 

3065
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:40,020
youtube,
well that's,

3066
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:41,110
you know,
they've already got that.

3067
02:12:41,111 --> 02:12:42,400
That's,
that's on their site.

3068
02:12:42,401 --> 02:12:45,340
So if you show it on their site as well,
it shouldn't be an issue at all.

3069
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:46,570
But apparently it is.

3070
02:12:47,070 --> 02:12:52,070
That's crazy.
It was crazy because that one song that 

3071
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:52,890
we played didn't get taken down the 
Michael Jackson one.

3072
02:12:52,891 --> 02:12:53,540
Yeah.
No,

3073
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:53,850
no,
no.

3074
02:12:53,851 --> 02:12:56,190
The a member of the two guys dancing in 
the street,

3075
02:12:56,220 --> 02:12:59,340
a Mick Jagger that didn't get taken down
that David Bowie,

3076
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:00,120
Mucinex,
what got us.

3077
02:13:00,810 --> 02:13:05,810
God is but not because of the music,
because I guess family guy had that in 

3078
02:13:06,481 --> 02:13:09,360
an episode,
that video in the episode so that it got

3079
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:10,560
taken down for family guy.

3080
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:14,060
Are you kidding me?
They must have bought the rights to that

3081
02:13:14,061 --> 02:13:16,250
video if you haven't seen that.
It is.

3082
02:13:16,251 --> 02:13:19,490
I forgot how gay is the gas jagger ever.

3083
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:20,460
And,
and,

3084
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:23,590
and fucking David Bowie got there was,
it was so bad.

3085
02:13:23,591 --> 02:13:28,591
It was unbelievable.
But I couldn't believe that anybody 

3086
02:13:28,591 --> 02:13:28,591
would think that that would be like,
oh,

3087
02:13:28,591 --> 02:13:28,591
here's the tiger.
Okay,

3088
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:32,280
well there to look at fucking thing 
running

3089
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:37,560
unopposed,
lying up to this whole jacked.

3090
02:13:39,331 --> 02:13:44,331
His arm was injured covertly.
Oh Dude.

3091
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,040
A bit.
His fingers off man.

3092
02:13:47,041 --> 02:13:50,690
You see that shit man.
It's like missing a shot.

3093
02:13:50,700 --> 02:13:55,700
We don't see anything.
There's some shot coming up with a list 

3094
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:55,700
where you don't see.
Look at.

3095
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:59,630
You're looking at all this grass.
There's nothing there and then it just 

3096
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:00,810
comes out and it's like you'd done that 
thing bit off.

3097
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:05,900
Half of that dude's hand.
Imagine that thing coming at you when 

3098
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:06,720
you're not on an elephant,
you just screwed.

3099
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:11,930
Kiss your ass goodbye.
It's amazing that it gave up bit off 

3100
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:12,510
half of his hand and then gave up.
It doesn't like curry.

3101
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:13,480
I'm looking at this.
Oh,

3102
02:14:13,481 --> 02:14:17,470
you suddenly look at this show.
Just bites off.

3103
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:22,710
Fucking fingers.
Son could've just as easily done that to

3104
02:14:22,711 --> 02:14:23,430
his head.
Oh yeah.

3105
02:14:23,590 --> 02:14:27,180
I mean there are such frightening 
animals,

3106
02:14:27,181 --> 02:14:30,300
man,
and the amount of people in India that's

3107
02:14:30,301 --> 02:14:31,290
been killed by them.

3108
02:14:31,290 --> 02:14:36,290
It's.
I was in India during a fight quest and 

3109
02:14:36,290 --> 02:14:39,141
they were near this river and are 
wanting this stream thing and the guy 

3110
02:14:39,141 --> 02:14:39,890
turns around and goes,
oh,

3111
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:41,340
I would stay away from scheme,
mini cobras,

3112
02:14:41,590 --> 02:14:42,630
cobras,
and I'm like,

3113
02:14:42,690 --> 02:14:44,130
okay,
I'm going to be over here.

3114
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:45,030
Like cobras.
Like,

3115
02:14:45,630 --> 02:14:46,980
oh,
there's a mouse in my basement.

3116
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:48,510
I know there's a rat in my basement.
It's like,

3117
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:49,080
Oh,
there's a cobra.

3118
02:14:49,110 --> 02:14:50,670
My basement.
How many people die?

3119
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:53,250
Cobras are fricken lot because they were
like,

3120
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:54,750
I always knew the street when they went.
Oh,

3121
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:56,520
many cord was there yesterday and I was 
like,

3122
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:57,210
ma'am,
oh,

3123
02:14:57,450 --> 02:15:02,450
out out dude.
The cinder bands is an area in India 

3124
02:15:02,450 --> 02:15:05,160
where 300,000
people over the last 200 years have been

3125
02:15:05,161 --> 02:15:10,161
killed by tigers.
They started keeping track when I 

3126
02:15:10,161 --> 02:15:12,300
started realizing their deliciousness,
300,000

3127
02:15:12,301 --> 02:15:16,440
people over 200 years.
That just makes my head hurt.

3128
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,510
Man.
That really makes my head hurt.

3129
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:23,810
Like,
what are you guys doing that as a 

3130
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:23,810
population of a medium sized city?
Yeah.

3131
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:25,110
That's a lot of people to give up to 
animals.

3132
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:26,580
Like Long Beach has like 500,000
people.

3133
02:15:26,581 --> 02:15:29,370
But meanwhile they're like still like 
try to like keep those things alive,

3134
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:30,000
you know,
they,

3135
02:15:30,070 --> 02:15:32,460
they work on conservation and they do 
man,

3136
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:33,540
they do,
they do,

3137
02:15:33,541 --> 02:15:34,040
they,
they,

3138
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:39,170
they have like a census team for tigers 
and these guys have to go with these 

3139
02:15:39,170 --> 02:15:43,610
special helmets on with masks on the 
back of them because it tigers don't 

3140
02:15:43,610 --> 02:15:44,370
like to sneak up on you or they liked to
sneak up on you rather.

3141
02:15:44,371 --> 02:15:46,080
So they put a mask on the back of their 
head.

3142
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:51,300
These poor folks are wandering around 
all brass job ever.

3143
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:53,460
Think about that tiger in the tall 
grass.

3144
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:58,520
How it ran.
It was running through the tall grass 

3145
02:15:58,520 --> 02:15:58,520
and we couldn't see it from above and 
no,

3146
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:03,060
if you're on the ground and the grass is
higher than your head and you're there 

3147
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:03,540
with two other dudes who have rifles.

3148
02:16:03,690 --> 02:16:06,570
Have you heard anything buddy?
What is that noise?

3149
02:16:06,810 --> 02:16:11,810
What is that noise?
I hit a bunch up and that is the last 

3150
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:14,600
thing he like.
Oh no,

3151
02:16:14,610 --> 02:16:19,610
it's a giant orange and white monster.
Fly done.

3152
02:16:19,950 --> 02:16:22,860
And I'm going to try to like shoot it 
with a little rifle.

3153
02:16:23,230 --> 02:16:25,860
Get off a shot before it malls,
me and my friend.

3154
02:16:26,670 --> 02:16:29,760
And what would you do if it just dove on
your right in front of a.

3155
02:16:29,761 --> 02:16:33,760
You will be so freaked out which even be
able to operate that bolt.

3156
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:35,760
Would you even be able to pull that 
trigger?

3157
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:37,780
Your ass will be gone,
Bro.

3158
02:16:37,781 --> 02:16:40,750
I've been like if I'm walking with Joe 
Rogan and I get bitten by a ton.

3159
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,630
Tiger leaps out of the tall grass.
Joe Rogan's out.

3160
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:46,690
He's doing mental math going spot and 
take him four minutes to eat.

3161
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:47,350
Jimmy.
Yeah,

3162
02:16:47,351 --> 02:16:49,870
I'm saying four minutes maybe and I 
don't want them to be the muscle.

3163
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:54,370
Walk away.
How far away can I walk in?

3164
02:16:54,371 --> 02:16:55,840
Four minutes is what your head is 
saying.

3165
02:16:55,870 --> 02:16:57,730
You don't want to insult as intelligence
either though.

3166
02:16:57,760 --> 02:16:59,710
You don't have to tell you to go pitch.
You don't think I know you're running.

3167
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:05,460
Maybe he'll respect you more if it just 
actually try to save yourself and just 

3168
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:05,460
actually run.
Would you actually whistle

3169
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:11,870
just going back a fucker.
Just going to back up.

3170
02:17:11,871 --> 02:17:13,500
You do the Diaz.
I don't know if that.

3171
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:18,280
I wonder if bear spray would work on a 
tiger like bear mace,

3172
02:17:18,281 --> 02:17:21,460
that fucking hot pepper spray.
I think we just piss him the fuck off.

3173
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:24,640
That's the last thing you want.
He starts eating you Dick First.

3174
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:29,800
Let's say outrun your friends.
Only method of getting out of a 

3175
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,680
tigertext outrun your friend.
Whoever you're with,

3176
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,690
a tiger kills you.
They'll just kill you.

3177
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:37,000
There's a lot of animals that would just
fuck you up.

3178
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:40,930
Like if you get attacked by chimps,
they're going sauces.

3179
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:41,620
Yeah,
they're gonna.

3180
02:17:41,650 --> 02:17:43,030
They're not.
They might not have kill you.

3181
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:48,070
You might die,
but they're just going to torture you 

3182
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:50,611
and rip you apart.
A chimpanzee is seven times stronger 

3183
02:17:50,611 --> 02:17:51,550
than a.
give me seven times stronger.

3184
02:17:51,670 --> 02:17:54,970
I did a thing with the chimp once and it
was a baby and it was really weird.

3185
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:59,970
It was only like two years old,
but it was like on my back and shit and 

3186
02:17:59,970 --> 02:17:59,970
he was hitting me.
It was for news radio.

3187
02:17:59,970 --> 02:18:04,530
I don't even think we wound up using it,
but the chip I swatted me on the bag of 

3188
02:18:04,530 --> 02:18:07,960
leaves a little baby and I was feeling 
so sing and then I was like,

3189
02:18:07,961 --> 02:18:09,220
man,
I'm so soft.

3190
02:18:09,221 --> 02:18:11,380
I'm so mushy.
Like in comparison to him,

3191
02:18:11,381 --> 02:18:16,381
like he was sinewy like they're made out
of a different thing and he was still a 

3192
02:18:16,381 --> 02:18:16,970
little sweetie,
you know,

3193
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,210
he's like a little.
He would hug him and stuff and he was.

3194
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:24,270
He was a baby basically,
but he was already getting ridiculously 

3195
02:18:24,270 --> 02:18:27,391
strong.
I used to do a show called American 

3196
02:18:27,391 --> 02:18:29,910
Ninja Warrior,
which is that that thing he's been on g 

3197
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:31,550
four thing where it's like the hardcore 
competition and one thing we always 

3198
02:18:31,631 --> 02:18:32,880
said,
me and Nicole is going to man.

3199
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:34,780
I's more like God,
I'd love to see a chimp go through.

3200
02:18:34,781 --> 02:18:39,781
This would almost be insulting.
Just watching chimpanzees will fly 

3201
02:18:39,781 --> 02:18:39,781
through this.
All these humans are fallen and can't do

3202
02:18:39,781 --> 02:18:39,940
it.
And like,

3203
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:43,120
well they did that maybe minutes.
Did you ever see that thing?

3204
02:18:43,121 --> 02:18:48,121
They did.
They did a show like it was like man 

3205
02:18:48,121 --> 02:18:51,010
versus nature where they did like a dude
with sprint next to a Giraffe,

3206
02:18:51,011 --> 02:18:54,130
a giraffe with sprint,
but they did a empathetic.

3207
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,830
Yeah.
Compared to the chimp and a navy seal.

3208
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:59,830
And I think,
I think that dude,

3209
02:18:59,831 --> 02:19:04,831
I don't know who fucking one.
I think the chimp might've got bored 

3210
02:19:04,831 --> 02:19:04,831
somewhere along the way and not figuring
out what the fuck.

3211
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:08,920
Like I feel like the chimp one but I'm 
not sure.

3212
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:13,450
I just feel like if they knew what you 
were trying to do,

3213
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:14,400
like get,
you know,

3214
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:19,740
they know.
Are you serious like you are you really 

3215
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:19,900
trying to go as hard as you thought we 
were playing?

3216
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:21,520
Man,
I totally understand.

3217
02:19:21,521 --> 02:19:23,680
It's hard to motivate to do certain 
shit.

3218
02:19:23,681 --> 02:19:28,681
Yeah.
Like why would he go like to go as hard 

3219
02:19:28,681 --> 02:19:31,831
as he can for survival sake.
Like why would he do that when you're 

3220
02:19:31,831 --> 02:19:33,050
essentially doing that,
if you like on your mom did set go,

3221
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:38,110
you're going with every fiber of your 
being and this champ is just kinda like 

3222
02:19:38,110 --> 02:19:39,500
lazy swinging on whenever he wants to 
do.

3223
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:43,610
Does he understand competition now?
All those kinds of survival,

3224
02:19:43,690 --> 02:19:46,430
it led to people going for it's food.
Yeah.

3225
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:47,480
Knows.
Outrun that thing.

3226
02:19:47,481 --> 02:19:52,481
Yeah.
He might know that asked to get there 

3227
02:19:52,481 --> 02:19:52,481
faster than you to get a cookie or some 
shit.

3228
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:58,630
Yeah,
because otherwise you're not going to 

3229
02:19:58,630 --> 02:19:58,630
really see what he could do and he would
get off the fucking ladder and beat your

3230
02:19:58,630 --> 02:20:01,460
ass here to compare to the animal 
kingdom.

3231
02:20:01,461 --> 02:20:03,200
We are physically pathetic.
Yeah.

3232
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:06,920
You're lucky that chimp doesn't want to 
really talk shit.

3233
02:20:06,921 --> 02:20:08,090
He'll like,
why are we swinging?

3234
02:20:08,091 --> 02:20:11,180
I'll just come over there and bite your 
fingers off.

3235
02:20:11,210 --> 02:20:13,730
Dude.
That was one good thing about that.

3236
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:18,760
The most recent a planet of the apes as 
if they were kind of realistic about 

3237
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:21,710
chimp behavior and the Cim holds up 
dudes down and bites his finger off.

3238
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:22,850
Yeah.
That's what they do.

3239
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:25,490
That's kind of their thing.
That's the real move.

3240
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:30,090
Screw that man.
The fucking creepy ass fighting.

3241
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:32,390
Pull your dick off.
Pull your feet off.

3242
02:20:32,630 --> 02:20:34,790
Pull your nose off.
Didn't even try to kill you.

3243
02:20:34,791 --> 02:20:37,010
At least a tiger just kills you.
Straight over you.

3244
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:37,920
Yeah.
Okay,

3245
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:40,910
so you go to some use chimp would 
probably eat you.

3246
02:20:41,150 --> 02:20:43,490
They're hungry,
right?

3247
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:45,550
Chimpanzee.
They're not meaning or something like.

3248
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:47,390
Oh yeah,
they eat monkeys.

3249
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,490
A chimp.
What size?

3250
02:20:49,491 --> 02:20:51,110
Chimp would eat a monkey.
He never seen that.

3251
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:52,400
I've never seen.
I've never seen this.

3252
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:54,850
You've gotta see this pull up.
I've been on orangutans.

3253
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,110
Orangutans,
chimpanzees.

3254
02:20:57,111 --> 02:20:58,580
Hold this up.
Oh yeah.

3255
02:20:58,581 --> 02:21:01,310
I don't think orangutans,
chimps,

3256
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:06,370
chimps.
So one of their favorite dishes is 

3257
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:06,370
monkey eat him alive,
man.

3258
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:07,160
That's what's fucked up.
They don't even kill them.

3259
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:10,030
They tried to get them like hip first.
They grabbed him by the.

3260
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:18,070
They tried to get me.
They tried to give me those gross stuff 

3261
02:21:18,070 --> 02:21:18,070
on [inaudible],
which I didn't mind doing.

3262
02:21:18,070 --> 02:21:21,530
I'll eat crow stuff.
Doesn't matter what kind of shit they 

3263
02:21:21,530 --> 02:21:21,530
tried to do it.
And the Philippines and legs.

3264
02:21:21,730 --> 02:21:26,730
Fear Faculty,
Filipino friends bring it right.

3265
02:21:27,471 --> 02:21:29,120
And then so,
but one thing they want to be,

3266
02:21:29,121 --> 02:21:31,550
he was in Korea that had to be live 
octopus.

3267
02:21:32,300 --> 02:21:35,050
The octopus is like fighting and trying 
to get out of your mouth and that's just

3268
02:21:35,090 --> 02:21:36,080
cruel.
Like I don't mind.

3269
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:41,580
I love octopus,
but I'm not gonna eat something that's 

3270
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:41,580
physically fighting me and striving to 
stay alive and shit.

3271
02:21:41,690 --> 02:21:44,960
I always love octopus Sushi until I 
found out that most of it's cooked.

3272
02:21:45,230 --> 02:21:46,010
Yeah,
mostly just kidding.

3273
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:51,040
I didn't know that.
I thought they would tell you if it's 

3274
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:51,040
Sushi.
They would tell you if it's cooked,

3275
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:51,500
you know,
I'm not supposed to go.

3276
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:53,720
Thank you.
My friend was Greek and they cook.

3277
02:21:53,721 --> 02:21:58,721
The octopus and grilled octopus are 
smart as fuck.

3278
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:05,020
A lot of people get kind of bummed out 
of people kill an octopus because 

3279
02:22:05,020 --> 02:22:05,750
octopus have like a really high level of
intelligence.

3280
02:22:05,751 --> 02:22:07,180
It makes them delicious and that.
Yeah,

3281
02:22:07,430 --> 02:22:10,250
whatever it is makes it does just maybe 
it's all that intelligence you have.

3282
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:12,050
What?
Maybe it'd be smart if they had bums.

3283
02:22:12,051 --> 02:22:17,051
Okay,
so this is these chimps setup this cds 

3284
02:22:17,051 --> 02:22:17,060
or like infrared,
see what's going on.

3285
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:19,690
It's like if they back it up,
they.

3286
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:23,270
They chased these chimps down.
Are these chimps?

3287
02:22:23,271 --> 02:22:26,100
Chase these monkeys down and cut them 
off at the pass and then

3288
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:31,100
watch.
They're all screaming while they have 

3289
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:31,100
this and watch how they eat it.
Man,

3290
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:34,011
they eat this little monkey a lot.
They got a hold of them and they just 

3291
02:22:34,011 --> 02:22:36,621
start pulling it apart.
These dudes are running to try to film 

3292
02:22:36,621 --> 02:22:37,980
this because it's like the first time 
that anybody had ever observed this back

3293
02:22:37,981 --> 02:22:42,981
before they observed this.
They thought that chimps were just 

3294
02:22:42,981 --> 02:22:46,580
eating berries.
They never knew that they the the 

3295
02:22:46,580 --> 02:22:46,580
monkeys.
Do you see it?

3296
02:22:46,580 --> 02:22:48,540
That part where it tears them apart.
It didn't show.

3297
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:49,350
It.
Didn't show them.

3298
02:22:49,351 --> 02:22:52,710
That one does a censored one.
There's the same video.

3299
02:22:52,711 --> 02:22:54,750
There's the full version of fried 
chicken.

3300
02:22:54,860 --> 02:22:59,860
He's grabbing it in the monkeys,
like going like this shit and he's 

3301
02:22:59,911 --> 02:23:04,911
literally eating him hip first sucks.
They're mean,

3302
02:23:05,710 --> 02:23:10,350
they're mean little motherfuckers and 
they'll kick your ass or they're closely

3303
02:23:10,351 --> 02:23:11,670
related to us.
Yeah,

3304
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:16,840
that explains a lot.
I wonder if during like the Roman days 

3305
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:16,840
they ever had human versus chimp fights.

3306
02:23:18,050 --> 02:23:18,380
I,
I,

3307
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:23,680
I do have a history degree.
I remember reading it as soon as the 

3308
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:24,010
rest of the lines a lot and they would 
put humans versus various,

3309
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:27,980
you know,
fought against lines or whatever.

3310
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:31,700
What would they let them use a from 
things that I've seen,

3311
02:23:31,701 --> 02:23:36,701
man,
it would have like a like pike type 

3312
02:23:36,701 --> 02:23:36,701
weapons,
like spirit type stuff.

3313
02:23:36,701 --> 02:23:40,370
Yeah.
What was fucking fucked up where people.

3314
02:23:40,420 --> 02:23:43,040
The ones that actually made the Asian 
line,

3315
02:23:43,041 --> 02:23:48,041
the north,
there was a European lion at one point 

3316
02:23:48,041 --> 02:23:48,041
and it's extinct now.
They made an advantage.

3317
02:23:48,041 --> 02:23:50,890
They took so many of them and use them 
for various purposes that they're,

3318
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:51,740
they're extinct.
They.

3319
02:23:51,890 --> 02:23:54,200
There was a European line and South 
Europe and now it's gone.

3320
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:57,660
This is the full version where you're 
going to see the chimp tear it apart.

3321
02:23:58,110 --> 02:24:03,110
Then they start screaming and yelling 
and making noises and all the other ones

3322
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:04,390
they,
they,

3323
02:24:04,430 --> 02:24:06,940
they run in and watch,
watch other pulling this fucking.

3324
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:12,500
They're just ripping this thing apart.
This is a different video because this 

3325
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:15,420
one is on the ground.
The most disturbing one was the,

3326
02:24:15,421 --> 02:24:16,110
the uh,
yeah.

3327
02:24:16,111 --> 02:24:21,111
Looking at me eating the fucking monkey.
The most disturbing one was there was a 

3328
02:24:21,111 --> 02:24:24,771
video of the monkey in the tree and the 
chimp has the monkey up in the tree and 

3329
02:24:24,771 --> 02:24:26,640
he's tearing apart while he's up there.
And it's like

3330
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:30,330
the monkeys phase going,
fuck,

3331
02:24:31,300 --> 02:24:31,820
there's so much

3332
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:33,290
close to people,
you know,

3333
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:34,680
a little monkey faces.
Like,

3334
02:24:34,681 --> 02:24:37,580
you really feel bad for him.
You really feel bad when it's good.

3335
02:24:37,581 --> 02:24:42,581
It's limbs ripped off and they're 
getting eaten by another thing that has 

3336
02:24:42,581 --> 02:24:42,610
sort of a people face,
you know,

3337
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:43,830
it's like,
Whoa,

3338
02:24:43,860 --> 02:24:46,230
this is the closest animal to us

3339
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:51,340
people.
People I think have a very kind of 

3340
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:51,950
Disney view of nature in many ways.
And it doesn't work that way.

3341
02:24:51,951 --> 02:24:54,560
Man is vicious.
Human beings are vicious to.

3342
02:24:54,561 --> 02:24:56,630
But yeah,
I've been talking about that in my act

3343
02:24:56,810 --> 02:25:01,810
recently about,
because someone got mad at me for a 

3344
02:25:01,810 --> 02:25:04,660
jacket with me,
but I had a fake fur jacket and some 

3345
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:04,950
woman actually said that,
um,

3346
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:10,070
I,
I don't like what you're tracking 

3347
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:10,070
represents.
And almost like fake for.

3348
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:10,070
She goes,
well,

3349
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:10,820
I don't,
I don't like what it represents.

3350
02:25:10,821 --> 02:25:11,420
And I was like,
what?

3351
02:25:11,450 --> 02:25:12,980
Killing fake animals.
I was like,

3352
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:15,950
I started talking about this on stage 
because it really is true.

3353
02:25:15,951 --> 02:25:17,180
It's this weird,
crazy.

3354
02:25:17,181 --> 02:25:20,120
Like this is not a real cookie.
Like this is not a real animal.

3355
02:25:20,121 --> 02:25:25,121
But the,
the idea is that you shouldn't for well 

3356
02:25:25,121 --> 02:25:27,500
do you know what happens to animals if 
you don't kill them?

3357
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:31,880
If the human doesn't turn them into for 
they get eaten by wolves,

3358
02:25:33,740 --> 02:25:37,970
they get eaten alive by wool,
they get ripped apart.

3359
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Guts first,
they chew them apart and then they eat 

3360
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,971
them and they eat their feet and they 
eat their head and then they ship them 

3361
02:25:45,971 --> 02:25:48,230
out in a big,
not afer and hair,

3362
02:25:48,260 --> 02:25:53,260
teeth and shit.
And that's what happens to you if you 

3363
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:53,750
don't get turned into a jacket,
like our idea that these,

3364
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:59,080
these beautiful within creatures are 
then taken and turned into terrible 

3365
02:25:59,661 --> 02:26:04,661
things that people wear.
And it's a god he representation of our 

3366
02:26:04,661 --> 02:26:05,300
cruelty.
Okay.

3367
02:26:05,301 --> 02:26:06,860
You'd rather get eaten by a wolf.

3368
02:26:06,970 --> 02:26:07,470
Well,
the fee,

3369
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:12,510
there's a great,
there's a great book called the 

3370
02:26:12,510 --> 02:26:12,710
Omnivore's dilemma and it's about this 
guy tries to.

3371
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:17,960
It's about food and where food comes 
from and he goes hunting and he kills a 

3372
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:17,960
pig and eats it.
And he goes,

3373
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:19,810
he goes,
he goes,

3374
02:26:19,811 --> 02:26:24,811
I felt bad.
And then I realized because he wasn't a 

3375
02:26:24,811 --> 02:26:26,921
hunter guy like,
and I kinda grew up my family hunts and 

3376
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:26,921
stuff,
and uh,

3377
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:28,780
he goes the death that,
that pig died instantly,

3378
02:26:28,990 --> 02:26:33,990
which is a way better death than it's 
ever going to get in a wild river by 

3379
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:35,440
some animal.
Either it gets old and get some diseases

3380
02:26:35,441 --> 02:26:38,290
and rots from the inside break.
So terribly pleasant.

3381
02:26:38,291 --> 02:26:38,680
Death.

3382
02:26:38,750 --> 02:26:39,260
Well,
by the way,

3383
02:26:39,261 --> 02:26:41,010
it gets eaten by pigs.
Yeah.

3384
02:26:41,050 --> 02:26:42,000
How about that?
Yeah.

3385
02:26:42,130 --> 02:26:46,210
You're fucking pigs are hungry and a pig
dies until just cannibalize the fuck out

3386
02:26:46,211 --> 02:26:49,360
of you.
So cruel world to take real world.

3387
02:26:49,390 --> 02:26:52,510
Many times people falling into pig pens 
and been eaten by pigs.

3388
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:53,770
Yeah.
They found a farmer recently.

3389
02:26:53,771 --> 02:26:55,630
They don't know if he had a heart attack
or what happened,

3390
02:26:55,631 --> 02:27:00,631
but they were looking for him.
They found his fucking clothes in the 

3391
02:27:00,631 --> 02:27:00,631
pig pen ripped apart and covered in 
blood.

3392
02:27:00,631 --> 02:27:01,150
Yeah,
that's a pig.

3393
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:04,040
Pigs can go fuck themselves.
Yes.

3394
02:27:04,210 --> 02:27:05,890
Oh my God.
That's one of the greatest.

3395
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:11,600
You know,
that guy breaks up with his top crazy 

3396
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:14,740
glasses shit.
Hence the 10 greedy,

3397
02:27:14,741 --> 02:27:18,310
like a pig is awesome.
He treated his English tea.

3398
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:24,030
Yeah.
That was a great fucking movie about 

3399
02:27:24,030 --> 02:27:26,440
English gangsters and fighting and pigs 
and such a romantic thing.

3400
02:27:26,441 --> 02:27:28,330
It's kind of a funny thing.
We met Jason Statham.

3401
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:28,800
Yeah,
yeah,

3402
02:27:28,801 --> 02:27:29,020
yeah.

3403
02:27:30,050 --> 02:27:35,050
Is it a lot of fights?
He was an affliction when I did the 

3404
02:27:35,050 --> 02:27:35,050
affliction.
Fights.

3405
02:27:35,050 --> 02:27:35,050
Yeah.
He loves fights.

3406
02:27:35,050 --> 02:27:35,640
He's one of those deals.

3407
02:27:36,170 --> 02:27:37,310
Very,
very nice guy.

3408
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:42,760
He's one of those digital places.
Same Cat in every fucking move over and 

3409
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:42,760
over.
I'm brought in to kick ass

3410
02:27:43,340 --> 02:27:48,340
parker movie.
That looks like every other movie he 

3411
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:48,340
does.
Some actors,

3412
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:50,360
man who just find that niche and go,
all right.

3413
02:27:50,361 --> 02:27:53,390
I'm always going to be that guy.
I was going to play that guy forever.

3414
02:27:53,391 --> 02:27:54,790
Many years.
Yeah,

3415
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:55,540
that's it.
That's it.

3416
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,140
Diversifying.
I'm just.

3417
02:27:57,170 --> 02:27:58,550
This is my niche.
I'm going to run with it.

3418
02:27:58,720 --> 02:27:59,930
Yeah.
Eddie Bravo was going.

3419
02:27:59,931 --> 02:28:01,360
You know what's important about him 
though?

3420
02:28:01,540 --> 02:28:05,050
He's a action hero.
He's a sex symbol and he's bald.

3421
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:08,280
He goes,
we need more of that shit to to.

3422
02:28:08,990 --> 02:28:10,630
It was really funny.
It's true.

3423
02:28:10,631 --> 02:28:15,631
He's like the first guy with like a 
receding hairline in years to pull that 

3424
02:28:15,631 --> 02:28:15,660
shit off.
I wonder how he was like,

3425
02:28:15,670 --> 02:28:18,010
how did he do it?
But other guys couldn't do it.

3426
02:28:18,011 --> 02:28:19,630
You know,
like burt reynolds couldn't do it.

3427
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:21,980
Like why didn't burt reynolds realize 
that he

3428
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,230
couldn't do.
I've been here for years.

3429
02:28:24,231 --> 02:28:26,210
I don't like my hair.
I just don't like my hair.

3430
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:28,220
It has nothing to do with any.
Like I have curly hair,

3431
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:30,920
so I don't like it.
The Godfather.

3432
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:32,570
Now when you have something,
that's what I looked like.

3433
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:35,470
Cubes Bright.
Absolutely.

3434
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:37,370
An extrovert on this.
What would you have?

3435
02:28:37,371 --> 02:28:42,371
Curly hair.
How's it affect the pubes are the extra 

3436
02:28:42,371 --> 02:28:42,620
curly so they,
you know,

3437
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:44,720
because your pubes are almost always 
curly anyway.

3438
02:28:44,721 --> 02:28:46,940
If you have straight hair.
Like my hair is pretty straight,

3439
02:28:46,941 --> 02:28:49,470
but my no significant differently.
No,

3440
02:28:49,530 --> 02:28:51,620
no significant difference.
Those are going to be different.

3441
02:28:52,610 --> 02:28:54,980
Black people got a weird with the pubes 
it's like,

3442
02:28:54,981 --> 02:28:56,630
wow,
that's craziness.

3443
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:58,160
She django.
Yes.

3444
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:00,140
Jen.
Jamie Foxx is junk.

3445
02:29:00,141 --> 02:29:02,650
Exposed to the world is about to get his
nuts off of them.

3446
02:29:03,370 --> 02:29:08,370
Yeah.
They grabbed them and they remember 

3447
02:29:08,370 --> 02:29:09,791
that.
It's not think those are real or were 

3448
02:29:09,791 --> 02:29:11,351
those like 10 people asked me that it 
was ruined my walking out of the movie 

3449
02:29:11,351 --> 02:29:12,620
and I'm like,
probably.

3450
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:14,780
Unless you had some particular 
objection.

3451
02:29:14,781 --> 02:29:19,781
Oh yeah.
Every dude was holding his nuts in the 

3452
02:29:19,781 --> 02:29:19,781
theater by the way.
Very realistic.

3453
02:29:19,781 --> 02:29:21,470
That's what they used to do to people.
They did it and it sucks.

3454
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:23,510
That's really fucked up when you really 
think that.

3455
02:29:23,511 --> 02:29:25,490
That was a couple of hundred years ago.
Yeah.

3456
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:26,960
Yeah.
Really ridiculous.

3457
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:30,170
It's like really not even.
Not even 200 years ago.

3458
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:33,260
What the fuck man?
Like what a,

3459
02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:36,290
what a wacky fucking species human 
beings are.

3460
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:38,600
I have.
My grandfather was really,

3461
02:29:38,601 --> 02:29:39,980
really old when he married my 
grandmother,

3462
02:29:40,010 --> 02:29:44,420
he was like 50 50 in his mid fifties and
she was 17 when I got married.

3463
02:29:45,290 --> 02:29:48,230
My Dad's Dad,
so my dad's dad was born in 18,

3464
02:29:48,231 --> 02:29:50,570
81.
His parents could have owned slaves.

3465
02:29:50,630 --> 02:29:52,160
That's my great grandfather.
Now.

3466
02:29:52,161 --> 02:29:54,320
It's weird because there's this big age 
gap in my family,

3467
02:29:54,321 --> 02:29:56,260
but yeah,
my great grandfather could have been.

3468
02:29:56,260 --> 02:30:01,260
I moved.
Were they from American tucking back 

3469
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:01,700
then in the hills of Kentucky for lead 
forever.

3470
02:30:02,230 --> 02:30:04,680
One was poor as shit,
so maybe they had slave.

3471
02:30:04,850 --> 02:30:07,940
It must've been my family for my band 
was sharecropping,

3472
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:09,210
uh,
not,

3473
02:30:09,250 --> 02:30:11,140
not,
not the plantation on an family.

3474
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:13,310
My family.
Now Kentucky is a strange place,

3475
02:30:13,311 --> 02:30:15,560
man.
You telling me so strange that the,

3476
02:30:15,561 --> 02:30:18,380
they call the Cincinnati airport,
but it's in Kentucky.

3477
02:30:19,530 --> 02:30:20,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

3478
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:25,320
They don't want to call it the Kentucky 
Airport because Kentucky's got such a 

3479
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:26,660
low,
a pink people have such a low opinion of

3480
02:30:26,661 --> 02:30:29,150
Kentucky that they call the airport,
the Cincinnati area.

3481
02:30:29,151 --> 02:30:30,170
My Dad's from there,
so I can say it,

3482
02:30:30,230 --> 02:30:35,230
but it's in Kentucky that it's like you 
land in Kentucky and they call the 

3483
02:30:35,300 --> 02:30:37,200
Cincinnati airport and then you have to 
drive to Cincinnati and like,

3484
02:30:37,220 --> 02:30:39,860
why are you pretending that shit is 
going down in Cincinnati?

3485
02:30:40,130 --> 02:30:42,080
Like you have a border and this is your 
border,

3486
02:30:42,081 --> 02:30:47,081
but I guess the land was cheaper to put 
a fucking airport and conducted must've 

3487
02:30:47,081 --> 02:30:47,081
men.

3488
02:30:47,081 --> 02:30:48,260
And then they just said,
let's just call the Cincinnati airport.

3489
02:30:48,261 --> 02:30:50,300
Fuck it.
That's ridiculous.

3490
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:55,690
Well,
it's because there's a massive 

3491
02:30:55,690 --> 02:30:56,951
insecurity with that state that state 
has always thought of Banjos and you 

3492
02:30:56,951 --> 02:30:56,951
know,
you see the same movie,

3493
02:30:56,951 --> 02:30:59,800
lawless with the moonshiners.
You just Shai Lebouf in.

3494
02:30:59,801 --> 02:31:01,490
They're no good.
That's my family.

3495
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:04,400
It's about moonshiners.
Your family was like bone loop,

3496
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:07,010
big time moonshiners and like,
you know,

3497
02:31:07,011 --> 02:31:12,011
and well my dad always told me this is 
really true and I've carried this with 

3498
02:31:12,011 --> 02:31:12,011
me a long time.
He goes,

3499
02:31:12,011 --> 02:31:12,020
uh,
people ideal as country life.

3500
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:14,810
It's violent as shit.
It was really violent back there.

3501
02:31:14,811 --> 02:31:15,740
It was.
People had a problem.

3502
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:17,750
You killed the other guy who buried him 
in the woods and I was at.

3503
02:31:18,150 --> 02:31:21,090
That happened all the time.
It doesn't happen all the time is people

3504
02:31:21,091 --> 02:31:21,940
thinking he knows,
you know,

3505
02:31:22,140 --> 02:31:23,360
this ideal at country staff.

3506
02:31:23,370 --> 02:31:25,050
He goes and the people had a problem,
you know,

3507
02:31:25,051 --> 02:31:26,760
one guy disappeared and that was the way
it went.

3508
02:31:27,220 --> 02:31:29,220
The beef that go back 50 years and 
stuff.

3509
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:30,240
That's,
that's where my dad's from.

3510
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:33,690
Jeff's winter's bone.
I have not heard it was good though.

3511
02:31:34,010 --> 02:31:39,010
Is that chick from the crying game or 
the hunger games rather than game 

3512
02:31:39,010 --> 02:31:40,350
criteria is one of the guy has a dick 
girl?

3513
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:44,580
Yes.
It's a really fucking creepy movie about

3514
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:49,581
the south,
about a guy who turns up missing and 

3515
02:31:49,581 --> 02:31:50,090
then the police are looking for them and
they don't want to give away any.

3516
02:31:50,091 --> 02:31:53,070
But it was really fucking good movie 
about that.

3517
02:31:53,071 --> 02:31:54,070
About how,
you know,

3518
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:59,240
this is our idealized view of Oh,
just good old country folks are a lot of

3519
02:31:59,281 --> 02:32:04,281
people smoking meth and there's a lot of
people that disappear and I'm not going 

3520
02:32:04,281 --> 02:32:04,560
to find them either by the way.

3521
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:07,480
No fucking crocodiles out there.
And there's,

3522
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:13,500
I mean,
how many in the everglades to find a 

3523
02:32:15,331 --> 02:32:18,240
body in the everglades if you have 
terrible,

3524
02:32:18,241 --> 02:32:23,241
terrible luck.
Some alligator hunters would come by 

3525
02:32:23,241 --> 02:32:23,241
your floating corpse.
Yeah.

3526
02:32:23,241 --> 02:32:23,940
And then they'll,
they'll call the cops,

3527
02:32:23,970 --> 02:32:26,370
but most likely they're going to eat 
that thing.

3528
02:32:26,630 --> 02:32:27,900
Done.
The stories I saw in that movie,

3529
02:32:27,901 --> 02:32:29,940
I was like,
my dad told me the exact same stories,

3530
02:32:29,941 --> 02:32:30,800
man.
His cousins and shit.

3531
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:31,680
Really?
Yeah.

3532
02:32:31,681 --> 02:32:34,010
That's fine.
Isn't it amazing to the dol?

3533
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:37,200
That shit came about back when alcohol 
was illegal.

3534
02:32:37,470 --> 02:32:39,270
That's where all.
That's where everything came from.

3535
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:44,320
Yeah.
All that organized crime Al Capone Type 

3536
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:44,320
Shit,
you know,

3537
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:48,051
that was the birth of the criminal 
empire in this country is the fact that 

3538
02:32:48,051 --> 02:32:48,990
they were suppressing people and keeping
them from having booze.

3539
02:32:49,130 --> 02:32:50,310
Yeah.
When,

3540
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:51,000
when,
when?

3541
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:54,180
It's true,
when society and laws don't match,

3542
02:32:54,300 --> 02:32:56,700
when something socially acceptable,
it's not legally acceptable.

3543
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,520
There's a problem.
You know what I mean?

3544
02:32:59,521 --> 02:33:04,521
It's just,
you know it whenever you have that 

3545
02:33:04,521 --> 02:33:04,521
disparity.
Yeah.

3546
02:33:04,521 --> 02:33:06,420
When socially it's not a big deal and 
legally it's a big problem.

3547
02:33:06,810 --> 02:33:07,620
That's a problem.
Yeah.

3548
02:33:07,621 --> 02:33:09,090
It's unavoidable.
People are just like,

3549
02:33:09,091 --> 02:33:10,030
fuck,
you know,

3550
02:33:10,130 --> 02:33:14,220
marriage is illegal in California.
Nobody buddy in California really cares.

3551
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:18,450
It's not like the laws lag behind what 
people really find socially acceptable.

3552
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:20,220
That's always gonna happen.
Yeah.

3553
02:33:20,221 --> 02:33:21,150
It's interesting,
isn't it?

3554
02:33:21,151 --> 02:33:23,430
And you know,
when it comes back to mma,

3555
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:25,500
the fact that it's still illegal in New 
York City,

3556
02:33:25,690 --> 02:33:30,690
disgusting in New York state drives me 
fucking crazy and that it all comes from

3557
02:33:31,530 --> 02:33:36,530
a corrupt union,
that it comes from the culinary union 

3558
02:33:36,530 --> 02:33:37,470
trying to strong arm station casinos and
to go in union.

3559
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:39,630
It's,
it's crazy ridiculous.

3560
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:41,220
And people drive to Jersey and watch 
shows.

3561
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:42,720
It's crazy.
It's crazy that it's illegal.

3562
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:46,020
You're not anything.
You're losing a fuck load of revenue for

3563
02:33:46,021 --> 02:33:48,420
the city to millions and millions and 
millions of dollars.

3564
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:53,600
They could mean qmap if they have like 
an Alistair overeem versus Cain 

3565
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:57,830
Velasquez,
heavyweight title fight in Madison 

3566
02:33:57,830 --> 02:33:57,960
Square Garden be awesome.
Holy fucking shit.

3567
02:33:58,140 --> 02:34:02,250
Holy Shit.
But they can have kickboxing.

3568
02:34:02,370 --> 02:34:06,630
So glory could put on a big event,
a big kickboxing event at Madison Square

3569
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:07,830
Garden.
Kickboxing is legal.

3570
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:10,110
It makes no sense at all.
No,

3571
02:34:10,170 --> 02:34:11,580
it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah,

3572
02:34:11,590 --> 02:34:12,720
I mean it's,
it's weird.

3573
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:17,870
It's weird that that kind of corruption 
is still so transparent and right in 

3574
02:34:17,870 --> 02:34:18,140
front of everybody

3575
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:21,530
and still you still get politicians to 
say nonsensical.

3576
02:34:21,531 --> 02:34:24,500
Nonscientific not fact based Shit about 
the sport.

3577
02:34:24,501 --> 02:34:27,200
And because of the fact that most people
are ignorant to the sport,

3578
02:34:27,201 --> 02:34:29,300
you can get away with saying stupid,
ridiculous,

3579
02:34:29,301 --> 02:34:31,820
nonscientific Shit and you don't lose 
your job.

3580
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:36,890
You know what the fuck's his name?
Whatever the guy's name is the one main.

3581
02:34:36,891 --> 02:34:41,891
I don't even want to mention them.
The main guy in New York that's 

3582
02:34:41,891 --> 02:34:41,891
constantly talking bad about a mma.
Yeah.

3583
02:34:41,891 --> 02:34:43,250
The guy that's been paid off by the 
union,

3584
02:34:43,580 --> 02:34:48,200
like that guy is wrong like all the time
when he describes it,

3585
02:34:48,201 --> 02:34:53,201
how he is,
he doesn't sit down with anybody and 

3586
02:34:53,201 --> 02:34:53,201
have debates on it about the safety 
aspect of it,

3587
02:34:53,201 --> 02:34:53,880
of you know,
what,

3588
02:34:53,890 --> 02:34:58,890
what the,
what tests involve and how it compares 

3589
02:34:58,890 --> 02:34:59,840
to other shit like Nascar racing or 
football or you know,

3590
02:34:59,841 --> 02:35:04,841
all different things that we accept that
have shown to cause death and horrible 

3591
02:35:04,841 --> 02:35:04,841
injury.

3592
02:35:04,841 --> 02:35:06,590
And that's just a part of life in 
competition.

3593
02:35:06,591 --> 02:35:07,670
We're,
we're fine with that.

3594
02:35:07,820 --> 02:35:10,760
But for this one thing,
you're telling everybody that they can't

3595
02:35:10,761 --> 02:35:15,761
do it.
You're telling everybody why are you 

3596
02:35:15,761 --> 02:35:15,761
being paid by the Culinary Union?
Yeah,

3597
02:35:15,761 --> 02:35:17,420
you are.
Well what the fuck?

3598
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:20,120
Like why it should be,
get the fuck outta here.

3599
02:35:20,121 --> 02:35:21,950
Everybody should go.
You're fired.

3600
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:27,280
First of all,
it should be on the front page of the 

3601
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:29,231
news.
Did you know that this guy has this 

3602
02:35:29,231 --> 02:35:29,231
opinion?
He's being paid whether his opinions not

3603
02:35:29,231 --> 02:35:30,110
scientifically based ridiculous and 
doesn't support the.

3604
02:35:30,320 --> 02:35:35,320
The opinion of his constituents and he's
being paid by this union that is trying 

3605
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:37,070
to keep the UFC out in New York.
You'd go,

3606
02:35:37,071 --> 02:35:42,071
well,
you've got to get that guy out of 

3607
02:35:42,071 --> 02:35:42,071
office.
That guy's a fucking scumbag.

3608
02:35:42,071 --> 02:35:42,071
He's corrupt,
but it's

3609
02:35:42,071 --> 02:35:44,680
still going on.
Allowed live stronger than a quiet truth

3610
02:35:44,681 --> 02:35:45,280
unfortunately.

3611
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:48,170
And the age of the Internet.
These motherfuckers.

3612
02:35:48,180 --> 02:35:49,980
So.
So what's next for you guys?

3613
02:35:49,981 --> 02:35:53,520
You have king mo this week,
Thursday night this week.

3614
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:54,420
Is it Thursday night?

3615
02:35:54,460 --> 02:35:55,570
Yes,
against premise law.

3616
02:35:55,580 --> 02:36:00,580
My clo,
which sounds like some kind of like a 

3617
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:00,580
bacterial infection.
Something he might have picked up.

3618
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:06,000
It might my Seattle Polish side of his 
balls and then Carl versus Ben Aspirin 

3619
02:36:07,030 --> 02:36:12,030
will.
And then we have to start at 170 pound 

3620
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:12,030
tournament.

3621
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:12,030
That guy,
man,

3622
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:14,460
that's.
That guy is a wrestling fool dude.

3623
02:36:14,461 --> 02:36:19,461
Six to.
Is it just takes you down and take you 

3624
02:36:19,461 --> 02:36:19,480
down,
but you got to have to figure out how to

3625
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:24,510
have like a Marcello Garcia type ground 
game to deal with that guy half maybe,

3626
02:36:25,350 --> 02:36:26,960
but I mean at the,
his,

3627
02:36:27,010 --> 02:36:28,300
his,
his grappling,

3628
02:36:28,301 --> 02:36:33,301
his wrestling is so fucking good.
He can just keep holding you in 

3629
02:36:33,301 --> 02:36:36,181
positions you don't want to be in.
He's great and scrambles and is just as 

3630
02:36:36,250 --> 02:36:37,980
his wrestling ability and his tech.

3631
02:36:38,030 --> 02:36:39,440
Yeah.
It's a wrestling fan.

3632
02:36:39,570 --> 02:36:44,570
If you found an Olympian,
and I remember watching Ben when he was 

3633
02:36:44,570 --> 02:36:44,570
in the,
in the NCAAS wrestling,

3634
02:36:44,570 --> 02:36:45,600
Missouri and then uh,
and the Olympics,

3635
02:36:45,601 --> 02:36:50,601
I'm watching Ben and his style is so 
funky that even if you found an Olympian

3636
02:36:51,030 --> 02:36:51,450
and went,
okay,

3637
02:36:51,451 --> 02:36:53,160
this will be my training partner.
Get ready for this.

3638
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:54,720
He's not going to wrestle like,
been asking him.

3639
02:36:54,810 --> 02:36:56,040
He's just weird shit.

3640
02:36:56,060 --> 02:36:57,710
Totally.
When everybody goes to the right,

3641
02:36:57,711 --> 02:36:59,660
he goes to the left and then it goes 
under you and you're like,

3642
02:36:59,661 --> 02:37:00,770
what is going on?
Yeah,

3643
02:37:00,771 --> 02:37:02,210
exactly.
And you know,

3644
02:37:02,211 --> 02:37:07,211
he's deceptively strong too and you see 
that a lot like guys to like physically 

3645
02:37:07,211 --> 02:37:09,370
they look like these beasts and he 
locked Lima.

3646
02:37:09,650 --> 02:37:10,010
Yeah,

3647
02:37:10,130 --> 02:37:11,390
exactly.
To the moon.

3648
02:37:11,391 --> 02:37:16,391
And you're like.
And he told me and everybody keeps 

3649
02:37:16,391 --> 02:37:16,391
telling me the same thing.
And if you're gonna fight,

3650
02:37:16,391 --> 02:37:16,910
Ben have to understand you're going to 
get taken down.

3651
02:37:16,911 --> 02:37:18,310
You spend some time on your back.
Yeah.

3652
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:20,930
They make this line in the sand where 
Douglas,

3653
02:37:20,931 --> 02:37:21,470
he told me,
he goes,

3654
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:23,000
I felt so good.
I was like,

3655
02:37:23,001 --> 02:37:24,060
there's no way this guy's gonna take me 
an hour.

3656
02:37:24,350 --> 02:37:27,050
And he threw me and I went,
oh shit,

3657
02:37:27,450 --> 02:37:30,290
it's going to be a long night.
Dan Hormonal told us,

3658
02:37:30,291 --> 02:37:35,291
he said,
I'm going to stop his take down for two 

3659
02:37:35,291 --> 02:37:35,291
minutes and then I'm going to beat his 
ass up.

3660
02:37:35,291 --> 02:37:38,530
He couldn't stop it for 10 seconds and 
they just mentally kind of give up 

3661
02:37:38,530 --> 02:37:38,530
because I go,
shit,

3662
02:37:38,530 --> 02:37:39,320
I was supposed to stop this and I can 
stop this at all.

3663
02:37:39,470 --> 02:37:41,480
You have to accept I'm going to be on 
my.

3664
02:37:41,481 --> 02:37:43,710
But at some point in this fight,
I think he can get married.

3665
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:46,950
Important.
I think those guys are very important to

3666
02:37:47,010 --> 02:37:52,010
the ultimate goal,
which is to figure out what is the best 

3667
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:55,161
way to approach any situation and I 
think if you look at like the kind of 

3668
02:37:55,161 --> 02:37:59,210
textbooks that they have available now 
in football where they've got every 

3669
02:37:59,210 --> 02:38:03,861
fucking play documented,
they have all these variations on the 

3670
02:38:03,861 --> 02:38:07,371
plays,
different things that have changed 

3671
02:38:07,371 --> 02:38:08,310
during plays that have made them more 
successful or errors that were committed

3672
02:38:08,311 --> 02:38:13,311
during these players and they have it 
broken down in a real scientific 

3673
02:38:13,311 --> 02:38:16,080
professional way and I think for a guy 
like Ben Aspirin,

3674
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:21,380
I think that exposes this new,
this new level of of wrestling ability,

3675
02:38:22,681 --> 02:38:27,681
this really unusual Olympic quality 
wrestling that nobody seems to be able 

3676
02:38:27,681 --> 02:38:28,440
to deal with.
Okay,

3677
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:31,020
you have a problem.
How you solve it.

3678
02:38:31,230 --> 02:38:32,100
What is it?
Is it,

3679
02:38:32,190 --> 02:38:35,280
is it another wrestler?
Is it a kickboxer?

3680
02:38:35,370 --> 02:38:40,370
What do,
what is it a guy who's got a nasty 

3681
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:42,651
guard,
Shinya Yogi type guy will let them take 

3682
02:38:42,651 --> 02:38:45,171
them down and then just trap some.
What is it that you have to do to get 

3683
02:38:45,171 --> 02:38:47,100
past that style because that fucking 
style,

3684
02:38:47,220 --> 02:38:48,940
whether or not you think it's boring or 
not,

3685
02:38:49,170 --> 02:38:51,870
a lot of people think it's boring,
it's super effective,

3686
02:38:51,871 --> 02:38:56,871
and the reality of a fight is that what 
is effective is what's good and 

3687
02:38:56,871 --> 02:38:58,950
someone's gonna have to figure out how 
to stop that.

3688
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:01,440
And it's super important to have a guy 
like that,

3689
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:05,310
a guy who couldn't do shit to everybody 
that no one wants them to do to them.

3690
02:39:05,310 --> 02:39:09,330
And the thing is is that Demian Maia,
I know a 40 fought Weidman,

3691
02:39:09,331 --> 02:39:13,440
he said I'm the best mixed martial 
artist I've ever been any last.

3692
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:15,900
Like it's almost like when you started 
becoming a mixed martial artist,

3693
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:21,080
he kind of got away from what made him 
good and he started losing fights and 

3694
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:21,210
Ben never does that.
Yep.

3695
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:22,380
Bingos,
I'm a wrestler.

3696
02:39:22,430 --> 02:39:23,130
I'm gonna.
Take you down.

3697
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:24,720
I'm a ground and Patty,
I'm using my Jujitsu.

3698
02:39:24,900 --> 02:39:26,850
He says,
I'm getting all these other skills,

3699
02:39:27,090 --> 02:39:28,440
but I don't take it until you can stop 
me.

3700
02:39:28,610 --> 02:39:33,610
He also,
Stanford gets away from that mentality 

3701
02:39:33,610 --> 02:39:36,320
of a wrestler.
He never get the strength is the 

3702
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:36,320
takedown.
See,

3703
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:39,020
that's the key to that description.
Damien Maia is not a strong takedown 

3704
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:40,110
guy.
I mean he has done some things like when

3705
02:39:40,111 --> 02:39:42,930
he.
He hit that lateral drop on Chael Sonnen

3706
02:39:42,931 --> 02:39:46,080
and wound up triangle and that was a 
beautiful take down,

3707
02:39:46,081 --> 02:39:48,330
but the reality is he could not take 
down Anderson,

3708
02:39:48,331 --> 02:39:52,290
so he's got whooped on for five rounds 
or at least three and then two rounds of

3709
02:39:52,291 --> 02:39:53,440
chasing them.
But

3710
02:39:54,040 --> 02:39:57,260
do you watch that and then you see the 
two of them move around.

3711
02:39:57,261 --> 02:39:58,000
You're like,
you know what?

3712
02:39:58,360 --> 02:40:02,260
I don't see any scenario or Damien Maia 
can take down Anderson Silva,

3713
02:40:02,261 --> 02:40:04,830
unless Anderson's injured.
Anderson's takedowns,

3714
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:07,690
his,
his defense to good speed is too good.

3715
02:40:07,691 --> 02:40:11,320
His technique is too good and his 
striking is too fucking scary and you're

3716
02:40:11,321 --> 02:40:16,321
not.
Your timing's going to be off because 

3717
02:40:16,321 --> 02:40:16,321
you didn't worry eating a flying

3718
02:40:16,321 --> 02:40:16,380
knee that you didn't think anybody could
ever reach you with.

3719
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:19,290
Anderson reaches him with a knee.
In that fight,

3720
02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:24,500
there's a flying knee that he hits 
Damien Maia with where he leaps halfway 

3721
02:40:24,500 --> 02:40:26,340
across the Octagon and connects with his
chin.

3722
02:40:26,341 --> 02:40:28,410
And you just like,
how did he get that far?

3723
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:33,680
It doesn't even make sense.
It's like a Michael Jordan type jump 

3724
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:36,740
where you see them jumping to go.
How the fuck did he cover that much 

3725
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:36,740
distance?
Carlos Newton,

3726
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:38,750
the timing of his flying knee calls 
coming in and pride.

3727
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:40,160
Yeah,
cleaned his ass,

3728
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:45,200
caught them clean.
And that was after getting really 

3729
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:47,451
dominated on the ground and Carlos 
mounted them and you know Carlos really 

3730
02:40:47,451 --> 02:40:49,200
was eating him up [inaudible] the ground
game.

3731
02:40:49,590 --> 02:40:53,820
But it's that combination of,
you know,

3732
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:58,910
the abilities is what makes Anderson so 
fucking spooky said he can defend 

3733
02:40:58,910 --> 02:41:03,471
himself on the ground.
And then when you get to standing up 

3734
02:41:03,471 --> 02:41:03,471
with them,
oh look,

3735
02:41:03,471 --> 02:41:05,880
you're in deep shit now he can do shit 
to you that you can't do to him.

3736
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:08,160
And it's his ability to evade physical 
pressure.

3737
02:41:08,190 --> 02:41:11,150
You can see that bond or tried to do it.
You should try to do it.

3738
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:14,370
Kind of put physical pressure on him.
And he's so elusive and invasive.

3739
02:41:14,400 --> 02:41:16,680
That's the hard part is trying to kind 
of pin him.

3740
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:21,950
You're not going to get them out a pin 
him down and make them feel the 

3741
02:41:21,950 --> 02:41:21,950
strength,
hard to do.

3742
02:41:21,950 --> 02:41:26,370
Only she'll send it.
It affect effect and we need a guy in 

3743
02:41:26,370 --> 02:41:28,200
that division like Ventura was a real 
threat before that fight.

3744
02:41:28,201 --> 02:41:28,650
You're like,
well,

3745
02:41:28,651 --> 02:41:33,651
you know what?
[inaudible] has some fucking serious 

3746
02:41:33,651 --> 02:41:33,651
hand speed.
He's putting,

3747
02:41:33,651 --> 02:41:36,420
putting knuckles to a lot of dudes and 
you know anybody that stands in front of

3748
02:41:36,421 --> 02:41:38,440
him when he catches him with that same 
blitz,

3749
02:41:38,441 --> 02:41:42,930
he hit vandelay width or rich Franklin 
or Akiyama,

3750
02:41:42,931 --> 02:41:43,270
you know,
you,

3751
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:44,820
you know that he could do that to 
anybody.

3752
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:49,820
But after that,
after Anderson knocked him out with a 

3753
02:41:49,820 --> 02:41:49,820
front kick to the face,
you're like,

3754
02:41:49,820 --> 02:41:50,200
okay,
well we'll.

3755
02:41:50,380 --> 02:41:50,910
Who's,
who's,

3756
02:41:51,050 --> 02:41:56,050
who's scary for him now?
There's no been scary for them right 

3757
02:41:56,050 --> 02:41:56,050
now.
Maybe Weidman.

3758
02:41:56,050 --> 02:41:56,490
Weidman's a beast.
He's a tough.

3759
02:41:56,520 --> 02:41:58,500
Why?
One's well rounded and physical and.

3760
02:41:58,580 --> 02:41:59,580
But he,
he doesn't.

3761
02:41:59,880 --> 02:42:00,540
You don't go,
okay,

3762
02:42:00,541 --> 02:42:04,350
this is the tool he's going to use 
necessarily like at least a tough dude.

3763
02:42:04,410 --> 02:42:06,330
It'd be as wrestling but have to be as 
wrestling.

3764
02:42:06,510 --> 02:42:08,460
It'd be beating them once again or 
submitting.

3765
02:42:08,461 --> 02:42:11,220
I'm trying to submit them and he's 
fucking cock strong.

3766
02:42:11,221 --> 02:42:16,221
Let that.
Why been totally so big boy has a real 

3767
02:42:16,221 --> 02:42:19,101
struggle to get 85,
but we're talking about you have three 

3768
02:42:19,101 --> 02:42:21,801
divisions.
I think UFC one 71 and five and tool 

3769
02:42:21,801 --> 02:42:22,020
five where the.
The the battle to see who gets the title

3770
02:42:22,021 --> 02:42:27,021
shot is a lot more interesting than the 
title fight itself because you have 

3771
02:42:27,021 --> 02:42:27,021
dominant champion.

3772
02:42:27,021 --> 02:42:29,640
Those divisions away.
I'm really excited about a few different

3773
02:42:29,641 --> 02:42:31,690
fights at one 70,
but I'm.

3774
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:32,970
I'm really,
I'm really excited.

3775
02:42:32,971 --> 02:42:35,820
Every time I see Johnny Hendricks that 
fucking did obese,

3776
02:42:36,090 --> 02:42:39,240
he is just listen on you.
He's hitting due to these punches.

3777
02:42:39,241 --> 02:42:40,690
Were you like,
what are there like,

3778
02:42:41,290 --> 02:42:44,320
is this like a stun gun at the end of 
his hand or something?

3779
02:42:44,321 --> 02:42:46,260
Like what's happening?
If only he could wrestle.

3780
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:47,520
Oh wait.
Yeah.

3781
02:42:47,521 --> 02:42:48,510
Okay.
Shit.

3782
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:49,350
Well,
not only that,

3783
02:42:49,351 --> 02:42:54,351
the thing that people don't know about 
Johnny Hendricks is fucking Jujitsu is 

3784
02:42:54,351 --> 02:42:55,890
ridiculous.
He taps people like crazy in the gym.

3785
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:58,560
It just,
he hit so hard that he doesn't even fuck

3786
02:42:58,561 --> 02:42:59,820
with that.
When it comes to a fight.

3787
02:42:59,970 --> 02:43:00,540
He's,
he's,

3788
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:02,110
he's a scary dude.
I think he's.

3789
02:43:02,140 --> 02:43:05,370
He's got the skill set to really give.
Just be problems.

3790
02:43:05,371 --> 02:43:06,480
Yeah,
exactly.

3791
02:43:06,481 --> 02:43:11,481
If there's one thing I think might be 
his Kryptonite is when you put it on GSP

3792
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:13,130
tends ago,
Shit,

3793
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:16,640
he tends to have that backup button.
He goes to his take down,

3794
02:43:16,641 --> 02:43:17,060
he goes,
okay,

3795
02:43:17,061 --> 02:43:22,061
and goes to his take down.
That might not be there against Johny 

3796
02:43:22,061 --> 02:43:24,700
Hendricks.
That's why he might have the capability 

3797
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:24,700
to,
to,

3798
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:24,700
to actually give you a piece of 
troubles.

3799
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:27,500
No one has so far.
If GSP can take down Johnny Hendricks,

3800
02:43:27,501 --> 02:43:30,050
people are going to be like,
get the fuck Outta here.

3801
02:43:30,051 --> 02:43:33,590
How is that?
His timing is awesome.

3802
02:43:34,510 --> 02:43:36,850
Struggled,
struggled with I shields.

3803
02:43:36,980 --> 02:43:38,130
Really didn't know.
I mean,

3804
02:43:38,340 --> 02:43:40,020
granted he did get poked.
John Fitch,

3805
02:43:40,540 --> 02:43:42,770
fitch down some good guys.
Josh Koscheck

3806
02:43:42,850 --> 02:43:45,880
Fuck John Fitch up on the feet though 
and he had him hurt from,

3807
02:43:45,910 --> 02:43:48,970
from punches.
Fitch is another guy that's like man,

3808
02:43:48,971 --> 02:43:51,220
what heart,
what determination?

3809
02:43:51,221 --> 02:43:54,270
But his physical prowess,
his,

3810
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:58,630
his athletic ability lags slightly 
behind guys like GSP.

3811
02:43:58,700 --> 02:44:01,120
Yeah,
I know he's worked hard on that.

3812
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:06,240
That was something that he like looked 
at after that fight and try to improve 

3813
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:09,781
upon,
but how much can you improve upon how 

3814
02:44:09,781 --> 02:44:10,420
much of a Mesomorph you are?
You look at a guy like gsp,

3815
02:44:10,421 --> 02:44:15,421
like especially after he came back from 
his knee injury and he started doing 

3816
02:44:15,421 --> 02:44:16,310
gymnastics to get swole

3817
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:20,110
strong as shit and can't get great 
timing.

3818
02:44:20,380 --> 02:44:24,040
Timing between striking and grappling.
You never know what the Fox coming.

3819
02:44:24,190 --> 02:44:29,190
He mixes it all up.
He's not predictable and he's smart and 

3820
02:44:29,190 --> 02:44:30,190
he's always in shape and after that Matt
Serra fight.

3821
02:44:30,191 --> 02:44:33,850
He's never gonna fuck off again.
You know he fucked off one time.

3822
02:44:33,851 --> 02:44:35,650
He gets starched and you realize,
okay,

3823
02:44:35,651 --> 02:44:39,110
you got to take every fight.
One hundred percent serious you.

3824
02:44:39,220 --> 02:44:40,480
That was the wake up call.
Yeah.

3825
02:44:40,481 --> 02:44:42,400
You have to be a professional.
Know.

3826
02:44:42,730 --> 02:44:47,260
What do you think about June junior dos 
Santos in Cain Velasquez.

3827
02:44:47,261 --> 02:44:48,300
What'd you think about that fight?

3828
02:44:48,810 --> 02:44:51,210
I thought junior dos Santos got years 
beating off his career.

3829
02:44:51,360 --> 02:44:52,410
Yeah.
Honestly,

3830
02:44:52,411 --> 02:44:57,411
I looked at that and I'm going,
please can just hit him hard enough one 

3831
02:44:57,411 --> 02:45:01,281
time for them to stop this [inaudible].
There's was a few times ref was going 

3832
02:45:01,281 --> 02:45:02,640
give me a reason to stop this fight and 
Desantos to his credit,

3833
02:45:03,970 --> 02:45:06,090
I don't want to say stayed in the fight 
because he didn't.

3834
02:45:06,091 --> 02:45:11,091
Exactly.
He wasn't competitive but didn't go 

3835
02:45:11,091 --> 02:45:11,091
down,
didn't get finished,

3836
02:45:11,091 --> 02:45:12,720
but it would've been better for him if 
that had been stopped in a second round.

3837
02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:18,020
Quite honestly he got beat so bad,
but when you go back to the drawing 

3838
02:45:18,020 --> 02:45:18,020
board,
if you're a junior,

3839
02:45:18,020 --> 02:45:18,720
dos Santos has camp and you go back to 
the drawing board.

3840
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:21,120
He got taken down,
he got beat up on the feet.

3841
02:45:21,180 --> 02:45:23,250
He got outworked,
his cardio wasn't there,

3842
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:24,060
so it's kind of like,
okay,

3843
02:45:24,061 --> 02:45:26,610
we have six things we've got to fix.
It's not like he took it,

3844
02:45:26,630 --> 02:45:29,730
like when when he knocked out cane,
they could go cane,

3845
02:45:29,731 --> 02:45:31,830
keep your damn hand up or whatever.
I know he had a knee injury,

3846
02:45:31,950 --> 02:45:33,510
but there are things you could fix.
There's a tweak.

3847
02:45:33,511 --> 02:45:38,511
You can make there about seven tweaks.
They got to make the junior dos Santos 

3848
02:45:38,511 --> 02:45:38,900
after that fight will pass.
Not He's his.

3849
02:45:38,970 --> 02:45:43,970
The latest is that he's going through a 
divorce and that's why he was not in the

3850
02:45:44,161 --> 02:45:47,100
right frame of mind,
but that didn't make any difference.

3851
02:45:47,101 --> 02:45:49,920
What kind did cain?
Cain was a monster.

3852
02:45:50,420 --> 02:45:51,810
He was a monster.
He dropped me.

3853
02:45:51,811 --> 02:45:54,540
Crack them with that right hand.
That's the super aids back there.

3854
02:45:54,541 --> 02:45:55,890
You hear that shit.
Trying to stay away from.

3855
02:45:55,891 --> 02:45:57,630
That's the exact opposite of what junior
dos.

3856
02:45:57,631 --> 02:46:00,270
Santos and Cain Velasquez having life,
right?

3857
02:46:00,300 --> 02:46:01,710
Exactly.
You're super aids.

3858
02:46:02,110 --> 02:46:03,990
You're the polar opposite of those guys.

3859
02:46:04,060 --> 02:46:09,060
Little esther logged into Amazon on my 
ipad and so now I've adding all these 

3860
02:46:09,801 --> 02:46:10,040
things

3861
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:13,460
to her wishlist,
like black anal beads and dildos and sex

3862
02:46:13,470 --> 02:46:16,070
and what a sweetheart.
What a good guy.

3863
02:46:16,790 --> 02:46:21,350
While we're here talking about fights.
You fucking weird.

3864
02:46:21,410 --> 02:46:26,410
I was bummed out that Alistair overeem 
pissed off because I really wanted to 

3865
02:46:26,410 --> 02:46:29,120
see that fight.
Let's talk about that.

3866
02:46:29,121 --> 02:46:34,121
I want to talk about this.
We talked about steroids before and the 

3867
02:46:34,131 --> 02:46:39,131
tone of the conversation.
Everybody said what you just said right 

3868
02:46:39,131 --> 02:46:39,410
now.
Just thought we're not going to see that

3869
02:46:39,411 --> 02:46:41,630
fight.
The tone wasn't that dirty.

3870
02:46:41,631 --> 02:46:46,631
Cheater at Oberlin.
No one got on their moral high horse 

3871
02:46:46,631 --> 02:46:46,631
about it.
Everybody just went,

3872
02:46:46,631 --> 02:46:47,030
God damn it.
I want to go see that fight.

3873
02:46:47,070 --> 02:46:48,950
Well,
it was just like,

3874
02:46:49,110 --> 02:46:50,590
oh,
everybody wants to see that.

3875
02:46:50,690 --> 02:46:53,720
And it confirmed what everybody always 
suspected about Alastar.

3876
02:46:55,910 --> 02:46:57,590
How's it possible?
That big?

3877
02:46:57,770 --> 02:47:00,200
Well then Paul Harris just pissed off.
No,

3878
02:47:00,290 --> 02:47:02,750
and the other guy we were talking about 
ridiculous physique.

3879
02:47:02,751 --> 02:47:07,751
He just pissed hot.
Remember when Vito got into UFC 

3880
02:47:07,751 --> 02:47:07,751
heavyweight?
Yeah,

3881
02:47:07,751 --> 02:47:10,910
like the muscle was glued onto him.
He was always one 85.

3882
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:13,640
Your frame holds.
All right.

3883
02:47:13,641 --> 02:47:18,641
I walk around,
I walk around like one 85 to 35 pounds 

3884
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:24,760
of that muscle to do it.
That is ridiculous.

3885
02:47:26,900 --> 02:47:29,360
That's crazy.
That's 55 pounds.

3886
02:47:30,060 --> 02:47:33,230
That's 35 pounds of muscle that doesn't 
belong there.

3887
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:36,230
That's inside.
And he gas against Randy.

3888
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:38,300
Whoa,
that's insane.

3889
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:43,420
C'Mon dude.
It's a backpack with 50 pounds and it 

3890
02:47:43,420 --> 02:47:45,050
you can earn 55 fucking pounds of muscle
muscle.

3891
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:48,830
Having a hard time believing that,
but it's true.

3892
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:50,240
Yeah.
When he fought randy,

3893
02:47:50,241 --> 02:47:53,060
he looked like a lion.
It was unbelievable.

3894
02:47:55,070 --> 02:47:58,560
His head looked like a zit on top of a 
mountain Atlantic.

3895
02:47:58,610 --> 02:48:00,750
He was gigantic back then.
Yeah,

3896
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:05,800
one 85 is the right way class for him.
We never had knocked out power to a 

3897
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:06,590
five.
Like he could stun you with the speed,

3898
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:11,980
but at one point five hits your wants 
and you don't know where you are and he 

3899
02:48:11,980 --> 02:48:14,951
never had that until five,
but he's like a blitzer but you know 

3900
02:48:14,951 --> 02:48:17,630
down him training now down in Florida 
with that Blackzilians team,

3901
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:22,900
Vito has always been a sensational 
athlete and being with the black 

3902
02:48:22,900 --> 02:48:26,531
civilians,
they got that Henry who's guy who's 

3903
02:48:26,531 --> 02:48:27,650
really tacked on gold dust style,
Dutch style striking and that guy is the

3904
02:48:27,651 --> 02:48:32,651
one who's been training all those guys 
where tyrone spong and I think that 

3905
02:48:32,651 --> 02:48:35,900
that's going to be really good for 
Vittorio to elevate the technical aspect

3906
02:48:35,901 --> 02:48:38,810
of his game because you saw it in that 
fight with bisping.

3907
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:43,100
He's still got ridiculous abilities.
I mean that fucking left high kick.

3908
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:44,760
That was very quick.
Yeah.

3909
02:48:44,930 --> 02:48:48,500
You know,
at since 1997,

3910
02:48:48,501 --> 02:48:49,940
you know,
fighting from 1997.

3911
02:48:49,941 --> 02:48:52,160
Now here he is in 2013.
I mean,

3912
02:48:52,161 --> 02:48:57,161
we're,
we're talking about almost a 20 year 

3913
02:48:57,161 --> 02:48:57,950
fucking career and the guy still lending
high kicks like that.

3914
02:48:58,130 --> 02:48:58,820
Ridiculous.
Yeah.

3915
02:48:58,821 --> 02:49:00,710
It was amazing.
Incredible physical abilities.

3916
02:49:00,830 --> 02:49:03,050
His problem is always been eight 
psychological,

3917
02:49:03,290 --> 02:49:04,930
mental,
getting them mentally into the fight and

3918
02:49:04,940 --> 02:49:09,940
has always been hard.
There's been fights where he's looked 

3919
02:49:09,940 --> 02:49:09,940
the second randy fight,
for example,

3920
02:49:09,940 --> 02:49:10,750
third one fight.
We didn't,

3921
02:49:10,870 --> 02:49:12,180
didn't even look interested in the 
second,

3922
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:14,040
fight it to a fight in the UFC.
And he like,

3923
02:49:14,041 --> 02:49:15,150
he didn't even look interested in that 
fight.

3924
02:49:15,151 --> 02:49:16,280
He was mentally beat,
like,

3925
02:49:16,290 --> 02:49:21,290
and you know,
that's been his problem in the past has 

3926
02:49:21,290 --> 02:49:24,321
been,
I think he's got a lot of mental issues 

3927
02:49:24,321 --> 02:49:24,321
and hopefully he's getting over those.

3928
02:49:24,321 --> 02:49:27,590
Yeah,
I think it's adding more dimension to 

3929
02:49:27,590 --> 02:49:29,010
his game and that's certainly scary.
Certainly gotten better.

3930
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:30,480
Certainly,
you know,

3931
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:35,690
he's,
he could conceivably challenge Anderson 

3932
02:49:35,690 --> 02:49:38,580
and make things very interesting if he 
could avoid getting cracked again,

3933
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:40,080
like he did,
you know?

3934
02:49:40,081 --> 02:49:40,710
Um,
and you know,

3935
02:49:40,711 --> 02:49:41,520
he could,
I mean,

3936
02:49:41,521 --> 02:49:46,521
you look at the,
their scrap on the ground where he was 

3937
02:49:46,521 --> 02:49:47,070
throwing these wild punches.
None of them landed on Anderson.

3938
02:49:47,470 --> 02:49:48,900
Man,
what if one of them did?

3939
02:49:48,930 --> 02:49:50,070
It could've.
Things could've been,

3940
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:53,580
and that's a big flood.
If obviously things could have been very

3941
02:49:53,581 --> 02:49:58,581
interesting because it was a.
It was quite a go until that front kick 

3942
02:49:58,581 --> 02:49:59,760
landed to the face.
Yeah,

3943
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:01,260
amazing.
How many dudes are throwing that now,

3944
02:50:01,261 --> 02:50:02,680
isn't it?
Everybody's strong.

3945
02:50:03,370 --> 02:50:08,370
Everybody's strong.
Nobody through that before every throws 

3946
02:50:08,370 --> 02:50:08,370
it down,
but they don't set it up properly.

3947
02:50:08,370 --> 02:50:12,771
It's kind of like the whole reason it 
works is that not a lot of people throw 

3948
02:50:12,771 --> 02:50:13,230
it and you're not looking for it and 
then it comes right up to the guard,

3949
02:50:13,710 --> 02:50:15,630
but people don't set it up and they 
throw it by itself and you're like,

3950
02:50:15,920 --> 02:50:19,470
what was the perfect technique to use 
against Vituro in that circumstance too?

3951
02:50:19,470 --> 02:50:22,740
Because Vito or had to close the 
distance on Anderson to use his hands.

3952
02:50:23,010 --> 02:50:28,010
So he was like more inclined to move 
forward and more inclined to not give up

3953
02:50:28,441 --> 02:50:30,450
ground and box is really heavy on that 
front leg.

3954
02:50:30,650 --> 02:50:34,500
So it kind of leaning over that and so 
he probably thought it was coming to the

3955
02:50:34,501 --> 02:50:39,501
gut.
Just going to tighten up real quick and 

3956
02:50:39,501 --> 02:50:41,541
just get pushed back a little bit and 
dome and hit some time riding the 

3957
02:50:41,541 --> 02:50:41,541
channel.
Oh,

3958
02:50:41,541 --> 02:50:45,450
what a highlight reel shot.
Anderson is just a fucking career.

3959
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:47,910
It's just a series of highlight reel 
shots,

3960
02:50:47,970 --> 02:50:48,840
you know,
freak.

3961
02:50:49,470 --> 02:50:50,310
Yeah.
It's,

3962
02:50:50,330 --> 02:50:52,030
it's cool to have a guy like that around
though.

3963
02:50:52,060 --> 02:50:53,350
I remember when he beat Hillary.
So Sakkara.

3964
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:56,130
Yeah.
That's all fricking old school.

3965
02:50:56,190 --> 02:50:58,140
Old School.
I am everyone Takahashi.

3966
02:50:58,600 --> 02:51:02,370
Was it Takahashi that condom condom in 
the triangle was um,

3967
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:04,680
a,
a desert,

3968
02:51:04,690 --> 02:51:05,070
the Casa.

3969
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:08,580
The Casa trying shoes on.
Yeah.

3970
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:13,900
Yeah.
And then was considered by some at the 

3971
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:13,900
time,
the best grappler in Japan.

3972
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:14,270
Very good.
Grounder rated,

3973
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:15,540
you know,
super,

3974
02:51:15,541 --> 02:51:18,000
super technical.
It just came at the wrong time.

3975
02:51:18,001 --> 02:51:21,480
I never really get it all together.
And then that real children flying,

3976
02:51:21,481 --> 02:51:26,160
he'll hook that he caught Anderson with.
That was one of the most insane moves of

3977
02:51:26,161 --> 02:51:28,200
all time.
Joe Lozan loves that.

3978
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:30,230
He dives that you've won some fights 
with him.

3979
02:51:30,270 --> 02:51:33,510
Didn't you submit Jason Chamber with an 
Inverted Hill again?

3980
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:36,810
It's back quick enough.
Yeah,

3981
02:51:36,811 --> 02:51:38,610
Dude.
I looked at him and was like,

3982
02:51:38,611 --> 02:51:40,370
are you okay?
Yeah.

3983
02:51:40,371 --> 02:51:40,970
No.
Yeah,

3984
02:51:40,971 --> 02:51:42,720
that's not a good one.
It's not a good one.

3985
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Your shit up was your meniscus up and 
sometimes guys don't come back from 

3986
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,380
that.
Especially meniscus because the inside's

3987
02:51:49,381 --> 02:51:50,320
all fucking.
Oh,

3988
02:51:50,340 --> 02:51:52,780
they got to put it in there.
It's bad.

3989
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:54,870
They do that.
Now they use cadaver meniscus.

3990
02:51:55,430 --> 02:51:58,870
Really just started stuffing,
stuffing dead,

3991
02:51:59,730 --> 02:52:00,740
dead peoples.
Uh,

3992
02:52:00,800 --> 02:52:02,910
I have a cadaver bones and ligaments.
Really.

3993
02:52:02,970 --> 02:52:06,070
One of my acs they.
But it actually becomes a scaffolding.

3994
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:07,360
It's kind of interesting thing.
They do.

3995
02:52:07,740 --> 02:52:09,370
Science is amazing,
isn't it?

3996
02:52:09,580 --> 02:52:10,620
Madison?
Incredible.

3997
02:52:10,730 --> 02:52:15,730
They put you back together again.
I have both my knees put back together 

3998
02:52:15,730 --> 02:52:15,730
in,
but the right one,

3999
02:52:15,730 --> 02:52:17,530
they use a cadaver.
The left one was a Patella tendon graft.

4000
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:19,600
So what it is,
is the cadaver graft.

4001
02:52:19,601 --> 02:52:22,630
It sits in there,
and then your body starts building cells

4002
02:52:22,631 --> 02:52:27,631
through it.
It works as a scaffolding for your body 

4003
02:52:27,631 --> 02:52:28,000
to kind of replace all the cells in it 
with its own natural cells.

4004
02:52:28,210 --> 02:52:32,680
It actually becomes stronger than the 
initial acl that got blown out once it's

4005
02:52:32,681 --> 02:52:34,120
fully,
completely healed.

4006
02:52:34,370 --> 02:52:35,420
I have,
thank God.

4007
02:52:36,080 --> 02:52:37,280
No,
no new problems.

4008
02:52:37,310 --> 02:52:38,390
That's amazing.
Yeah.

4009
02:52:38,391 --> 02:52:42,740
Well I did lose a minor stabilizer in my
knee when I was fighting.

4010
02:52:42,741 --> 02:52:44,010
James Wilkes,
like,

4011
02:52:44,250 --> 02:52:46,880
like a,
like an MCL minor?

4012
02:52:46,950 --> 02:52:47,210
No,
no.

4013
02:52:47,220 --> 02:52:52,220
On the sides of your knee cap.
Basically these two tendons that Kinda 

4014
02:52:52,220 --> 02:52:54,741
like button your,
your top and bottom bone together and 

4015
02:52:54,741 --> 02:52:55,640
mine just popped and just came off so 
you don't have one.

4016
02:52:55,641 --> 02:52:57,620
I don't have one there,
but a doctor told me,

4017
02:52:57,621 --> 02:52:59,060
he goes,
it's not a major stabilizer.

4018
02:52:59,070 --> 02:53:00,650
You're fine.
It's funny story.

4019
02:53:00,651 --> 02:53:05,651
I was fighting James Wilson and I'm 
going for a knee bar on him and we're 

4020
02:53:05,651 --> 02:53:08,681
rolling around and I hear this loud pop 
come from my knee and James had really 

4021
02:53:08,681 --> 02:53:11,450
good Thai and I went,
I can't stand up limping period.

4022
02:53:11,930 --> 02:53:14,960
So I'm rolling for his knee bar and I 
wanted in any way but in my head I went,

4023
02:53:15,080 --> 02:53:16,730
well either I get this knee bar,
I'm pretty screwed.

4024
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:18,530
So we're rolling around and rolling 
around.

4025
02:53:18,531 --> 02:53:23,531
We'll run it and I get this knee bar and
I crank it and he taps and I stood up 

4026
02:53:23,531 --> 02:53:23,590
and I went and raised.
Man.

4027
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:26,900
I walked out of the cage and I got a 
couple of steps and I can't walk anymore

4028
02:53:26,901 --> 02:53:31,901
and I went,
if all the adrenaline I have in my 

4029
02:53:31,901 --> 02:53:31,901
system,
I can't walk right now.

4030
02:53:31,901 --> 02:53:32,960
This is really bad.
I mean I couldn't get to the car,

4031
02:53:32,961 --> 02:53:34,790
but they never surgically,
they don't.

4032
02:53:35,090 --> 02:53:37,670
They repair that one or you know,
I guess they can,

4033
02:53:37,671 --> 02:53:39,590
but it gets a big deal and they were 
like,

4034
02:53:39,591 --> 02:53:40,550
well,
you'll be all right.

4035
02:53:40,551 --> 02:53:42,050
And it's never given me a problem since 
like,

4036
02:53:42,051 --> 02:53:45,890
so it healed up in like three weeks.
And then every body I know the trains or

4037
02:53:45,891 --> 02:53:46,730
something.
Fuck,

4038
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:48,080
I got very lucky.
My neck,

4039
02:53:48,350 --> 02:53:50,750
my neck is the one the only shot that 
ever.

4040
02:53:50,751 --> 02:53:55,751
Um,
I'll stop sparring is when I get hit on 

4041
02:53:55,751 --> 02:53:55,751
top of the head.

4042
02:53:55,751 --> 02:53:55,751
Alright,
we gotta get Outta here.

4043
02:53:55,751 --> 02:53:57,010
This is three hours into our 
conversation.

4044
02:53:57,011 --> 02:54:02,011
Dude.
We could do this a hundred times about 

4045
02:54:02,011 --> 02:54:02,011
mma.
We could do this forever.

4046
02:54:02,011 --> 02:54:02,860
Listen to culver city,
man.

4047
02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:07,920
We went from Ela to bring peace to the 
MMA world because there's a separation 

4048
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:12,690
boundary.
Belfort or mean between Bella tour in 

4049
02:54:12,690 --> 02:54:15,061
the UFC.
This like everyone thinks that we have 

4050
02:54:15,061 --> 02:54:15,061
to be enemies.
I don't kiss a bullshit bank.

4051
02:54:15,061 --> 02:54:16,810
We'll sit down and talk some fucking 
fight.

4052
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:19,100
I don't get that at all man.
Man.

4053
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:21,580
It's good for the business is good for 
the sport.

4054
02:54:21,581 --> 02:54:26,581
It's good for the enjoyment.
Like the idea that you shouldn't enjoy 

4055
02:54:26,581 --> 02:54:28,090
the UFC or I should enjoy bellatore is 
ridiculous.

4056
02:54:28,091 --> 02:54:33,091
Stupid.
But I want to thank you for being the 

4057
02:54:33,091 --> 02:54:33,580
guy that I enjoy the most when it comes 
to commentary and when,

4058
02:54:33,610 --> 02:54:38,610
when I,
when I watched you like what a referee 

4059
02:54:38,610 --> 02:54:38,610
does,
something stupid and you yell at 'em and

4060
02:54:38,610 --> 02:54:41,200
when a guy's going for something and you
call it and you know,

4061
02:54:41,201 --> 02:54:45,070
I think you do an awesome job and it 
makes watching fights.

4062
02:54:45,071 --> 02:54:45,580
Very exciting.

4063
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:49,780
That means a lot to me and I want to say
that Joe Rogan basically blaze the trail

4064
02:54:49,781 --> 02:54:52,750
for everybody like me in mma 
broadcasting.

4065
02:54:52,751 --> 02:54:53,140
You're the king.

4066
02:54:53,330 --> 02:54:55,290
I got lucky.
I came along and I,

4067
02:54:55,291 --> 02:54:58,100
I,
I didn't have to worry about losing that

4068
02:54:58,101 --> 02:55:02,110
Gig because I had another Gig so I could
talk shit works out well.

4069
02:55:02,120 --> 02:55:02,990
Worked out well.
We got,

4070
02:55:03,110 --> 02:55:06,860
we all got lucky.
Thank you everybody for tuning into this

4071
02:55:06,861 --> 02:55:11,861
podcast.
We'll be back tomorrow with David Cho 

4072
02:55:11,861 --> 02:55:13,370
and our buddy Yoshi,
and then Wednesday will be the return of

4073
02:55:13,371 --> 02:55:16,520
Rick Ross,
Rick Ross back in the house,

4074
02:55:16,521 --> 02:55:21,521
bitches new new pieces of evidence in 
the investigation and he has a new trial

4075
02:55:22,161 --> 02:55:23,330
date.
The Rick Ross,

4076
02:55:23,331 --> 02:55:27,290
the real rick Ross,
not the wrapper and Rick Ross is selling

4077
02:55:27,320 --> 02:55:32,320
tee shirts now that say the real rick 
Ross is not a rapper because we told 

4078
02:55:32,320 --> 02:55:34,220
them to do that on the podcast and he 
started doing it.

4079
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:37,970
So he's making money off of a fucking 
scandal.

4080
02:55:37,971 --> 02:55:41,930
Ladies and gentlemen,
