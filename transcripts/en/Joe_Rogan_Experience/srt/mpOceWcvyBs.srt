00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,770
But what they're essentially doing is
just piecing together what they think is

3
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:12,771
like an argument based on
these predetermined patterns
that they've picked up.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,261
Exactly.

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:13,500
Like,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:13,861
you know,

7
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:17,400
as you as a white male wouldn't understand
a woman of color what fucking color

8
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:20,130
you will like what you're white.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,761
I mean you're,

10
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:21,600
you're Asian,

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,540
but I mean when you're talking
about the color of your skin,

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,770
you can't say color.

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,873
You just can't,

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,290
you might want to say ethnicity.

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,311
You might want to say,

16
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:29,681
you know,

17
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:30,090
uh,

18
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,923
whatever,

19
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,530
uh,

20
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,370
background.

21
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,010
Mm.

22
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,180
Well,

23
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,870
I mean,

24
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,230
look,

25
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,010
let me clarify.

26
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,800
There is,

27
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I completely concede that there is a
lived experience of being a certain,

28
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,610
being a minority ethnicity,

29
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,830
especially in America or in Australia,

30
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,210
um,

31
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,570
new countries that is different
from being a white man.

32
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,760
I absolutely concede that.

33
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,710
The thing is why can't we talk about
the actual details of the experience

34
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,420
without assuming that
there's a homogeneity between
that experience as well.

35
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,760
Like not every Asian experience
in America is the same.

36
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,270
They have certain commonalities in that
they're subject to racism in a way that

37
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:08,104
you and I aren't,

38
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,960
but they are so wildly different.

39
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,110
Let's talk about the details
of the experience and what's
acceptable and how we,

40
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,030
how we want to converse with one another.

41
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,230
Let's not assume that because a person
has a particular set bunch of labels

42
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:21,064
attached to them,

43
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,550
gay,

44
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,090
straight,

45
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,541
Asian,

46
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,470
white man,

47
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:23,920
woman,

48
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,251
whatever,

49
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,940
that that immediately disqualifies them
from having a conversation about these

50
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:28,500
things.

51
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,680
It's weird when you look at people
from that error and you consider

52
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,140
that was him.

53
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,973
I get that.

54
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,290
We're fucking groovy mustache.

55
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,760
Wouldn't you love to go back in
time and hang out with John L.

56
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:40,761
Sullivan?

57
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:42,470
We use the fucking heavyweight
champion of the world.

58
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,353
Yeah.

59
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,560
Can you imagine some of
the old school puts you,

60
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:48,340
that guy got old school place.

61
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,870
You imagine what it must've been like.

62
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,890
Just a funny saying.

63
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,040
In Sullivan's era,

64
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,470
no formal boxing titles existed.

65
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,570
He became a champion after defeating
Patty Ryan and Mississippi City near Gulf

66
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,270
Port Mississippi on February 7th,

67
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,140
1882 modern authorities have retroactively
labeled Ryan the heavyweight champion

68
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:09,974
of America.

69
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,750
But any claim to Ryan being a world
champion would have been dubious.

70
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:17,930
He had never contended
internationally as Sullivan had.

71
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,430
I could lick Patty Ryan,

72
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,303
not crazy.

73
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,250
Sullivan was first considered the world
heavyweight champion after either 1888

74
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,840
when he fought Charlie Mitchell in France
or the following year when he knocked

75
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:34,841
out Jake kill rain in a ready
for this round 75 I told you,

76
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,293
wow.

77
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,740
Have a scheduled 80 round.

78
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,390
They a schedule the schedule.

79
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,480
I didn't even know the head
of the end told off fuck set.

80
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:48,350
Round 75 that hurts my head.

81
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,390
Just how long was he drowned though?

82
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:51,770
Is he trying to like two seconds?

83
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,980
I think it was three minutes.

84
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:56,360
I think it was just like it is today.

85
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,281
Fucking,

86
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:58,581
Hey,

87
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:00,280
what does an in time,

88
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,750
what does that and what the
fuck is 75 times fat and a half,

89
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,074
two hours,

90
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,030
225 minutes.

91
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,410
So it's a,

92
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,031
Oh my God,

93
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:13,930
that's sane.

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,370
I think they're doing a podcast.

95
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,421
That's insane.

96
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,510
Can you imagine bare knuckle
boxing a guy for three hours?

97
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,800
How much do you believe in,

98
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,870
whether it is DNA or a soul or something
like something that's purely uniquely

99
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,130
about that person when they are born
and that's part of our day are or match

100
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:29,980
matches called a cherry.

101
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,500
You know the famous nurture
versus culture debate.

102
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:32,851
What,

103
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:35,650
what's your take on what's
more important in this?

104
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,810
I don't know.

105
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,280
Well they have done studies where they've
taken twins that were separated at

106
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:41,760
birth,

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,130
there were adopted and they
get them together after not
seeing each other entire

108
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,540
life and they find out they
like the same kind of music.

109
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,070
Really?

110
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,291
Yeah.

111
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,590
They have very similar likes and dislikes.

112
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:54,420
Their personalities are very similar.

113
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,840
There's a strong argument
for nature over nurture.

114
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,130
Right.

115
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,710
But there's no denying that
nurture plays a huge role as well.

116
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:02,191
I should take,

117
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,090
it's either or.

118
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,420
I think we live in a soup of possibilities
and I think that you can get super

119
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:14,301
lucky with the amount of exposure that
you have to positive and even to negative

120
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:15,414
things.

121
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,650
Like there's an expression,

122
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,630
hard times make good people,

123
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,231
you know,

124
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:24,231
and I do believe that in a certain
sense that there's some experiences that

125
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,070
children and adults even have that
they get through and it makes them more

126
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:29,791
empathetic.

127
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,060
It makes them kinder and make some
more understanding and it makes them

128
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:33,661
stronger,

129
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,200
like more,

130
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,033
more character.

131
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,021
Even that the way,

132
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:37,390
it's funny because you're right,

133
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,750
I mean there's part of that
argument that's south at
through and you do see that

134
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,110
happen a lot and then you see somebody
who was through the exact same thing and

135
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,760
it makes them 10 times more of an asshole.

136
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,570
He's like,

137
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,050
I go heart song on her and everybody
else into pyrolysis and of them and he's

138
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,040
like that.

139
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,060
That's where you think like what is the
make these one person make a right turn

140
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,450
and go in and their action where they
become kinder and nicer because they felt

141
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:02,920
what it is to get hurt and what is the
other one may make the complete opposite

142
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:05,380
turn and go in a direction of Aiga hearts.

143
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,030
I don't care for anybody else's feeding.

144
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,490
Everybody has to pay for the
Fed that I go heart ones.

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,340
Yeah.

146
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,801
It's weird,

147
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:11,100
right?

148
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,940
It's like there's that moment where you
can really make a 90 degree turn one way

149
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,774
or another.

150
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,590
What is the make people
make the choices they make.

151
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,720
And I think hormones have a stigma in
this country because of Barry bonds and

152
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:29,030
fucking Sammy Sosa and all this
crazy shit where everybody's like,

153
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,421
oh,

154
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,950
this is fucking cheaters in baseball.

155
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:35,840
They ruined everything and sports
and everyone is so concerned with um,

156
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,410
what we hear about with
cheating and steroids and
athletic performance that then

157
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,050
you're missing out on a core essential
aspect of being a human being,

158
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,280
being a man,

159
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,700
especially um,

160
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,560
the lack of testosterone
directly related to depression,

161
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,990
directly related to these,

162
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,490
these people that start hitting age
regardless of traumatic brain injury,

163
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,760
they start getting older and
they feel like fucking shit.

164
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,900
They feel like shit.

165
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,810
And I've talked to a lot of them that
get on testosterone and all of a sudden

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,280
their glow again,

167
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,360
they have energy.

168
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,090
They want to start doing
things there are active.

169
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:16,091
And someone I've talked to guys who are
on testosterone that don't like to talk

170
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,760
about it because they're worried that
someone's going to look at them first of

171
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:22,250
all as being inferior
because they need to add,

172
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,240
you know,

173
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,480
artificial testosterone to
their system and that they're,

174
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,280
they might be a roid head now.

175
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,020
They might be a cheater and some like,

176
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:30,890
what are you fucking planet?

177
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,050
You're 55 years old,

178
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,390
you playing major league baseball
behind my back with the life,

179
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,860
your life tutor,

180
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,630
you're doing too good with these new home.

181
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,800
Meanwhile you'll take aspirin
if you have a fucking headache,

182
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,320
you take Ibuprofen,

183
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,120
you'll take medication if you're sick.

184
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,040
Like why won't you take testosterone?

185
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,320
Why won't you get your
hormone levels change?

186
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:52,520
I have a very good friend that won't
do it because he's afraid of all these

187
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:52,821
other things.

188
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:53,031
I'm like,

189
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:53,420
Bro,

190
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,650
you look like shit

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,280
tired all the time.

192
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,020
Like what do you worry about?

193
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,190
And the difference to me is like us
being there and these guys who like I sat

194
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,820
down with a guy two weeks ago,

195
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:06,660
wrote a script about a,

196
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,830
met him for the first time.

197
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,180
Lovely guy,

198
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,350
like the sweetest,

199
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:10,951
sweetest,

200
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:11,551
nicest guy,

201
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:13,770
loves to fish and all this and I'm like,

202
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,320
so how is it like we
really get down to basics.

203
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:16,651
He's like,

204
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:17,311
it's good man,

205
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,144
it's good,

206
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,240
but some days I just have to find a
reason to go on live in and you're just

207
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:24,780
like,

208
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,830
you understand at that point how
different it is for these guys,

209
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:31,170
like how much more drastic it is,

210
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,130
how much more important it is to
to reach out to these guys and,

211
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,470
and somebody's got to do it.

212
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,460
What about panda bears?

213
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,031
Are they vicious?

214
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,050
Vicious rapist.

215
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,530
Okay.

216
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,640
Horrible racists.

217
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,210
Okay.

218
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,170
Pan Is the worst.

219
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,011
Koala bears.

220
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:46,500
Very lot of sexually transmitted disease.

221
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,420
Chlamydia like for real,

222
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,030
that's all.

223
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,380
Bears transmit sexually transmitted
diseases to each other or they die people.

224
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,850
I think two is once you get the clap,

225
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,670
I never cheat on you with people.

226
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,920
It was so cute and then he
just starts fucking man.

227
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,871
It's weird.

228
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:02,800
Koala bears there.

229
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:03,870
It's killing them though.

230
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,733
Like as an eight,

231
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,120
it's threatening to take 'em out.

232
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,230
Midea the STD threatening and Australian
icon gone take them down a planned

233
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:15,064
parenthood.

234
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,680
What late that gets kind of,

235
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,501
here's the thing,

236
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:17,920
man,

237
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,440
we're so funny with what
we want to keep around.

238
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,000
You know we have this idea that we
are in charge somehow or another,

239
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:28,420
making sure that animals don't go extinct
and the like Koala bear needs to stay

240
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:28,990
around.

241
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,560
Right?

242
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,550
Like does it really,

243
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,380
I mean I don't think we
should go kill them all.

244
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:32,891
Okay.

245
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:33,640
I don't think that,

246
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,710
but if they all died
because of fucking herpes.

247
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,220
Yeah.

248
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,730
I think maybe we should concentrate on
poor people before we concentrate on

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,691
herpes.

250
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:41,860
Written Koala bears.

251
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,000
Absolutely.

252
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:43,600
Dude,

253
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
you're writing crazy sense of,

254
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:45,970
but when it comes to that shit,

255
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,460
you can accidentally get
an STD from a coauthor.

256
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,153
Okay.

257
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,700
That's what you should have.

258
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,980
You should have called bears
in your house that way.

259
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,620
You always have a built in me.

260
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,150
He should get a fucking Koala.

261
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,090
It's not what you think Connie babies.

262
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:03,390
Look,

263
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,940
I'm going to show you
the article on Google.

264
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,720
It's a pdf file.

265
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,720
Your House and Edu address.

266
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,590
Your House has just tanning beds and cool.

267
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,580
Just so you have an hour.

268
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,480
I'll shit that can give you STDs.

269
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,743
Seats.

270
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,800
Has anybody ever really gotten to a
Tammy bed venereal diseases that real?

271
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,080
I have no idea.

272
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:25,451
I didn't.

273
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:25,711
I know.

274
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,150
This is the first I'm hearing of this.

275
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,421
Yeah.

276
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:27,781
You can get,

277
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:30,540
supposedly you can get
herpes from a tanning bed.

278
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,610
Get herpes from a toilet seat.

279
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,000
No,

280
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,660
you can you,

281
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:33,840
yeah.
