1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,440
And we're live.
You don't have headphones.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,843
There you go.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,550
Alex Niles Gray.
Hello.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,890
How are you guys?
Great job.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,920
I think you got to turn that sucker
around and see that one.

6
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:18,540
There you go.
Nope.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,500
Oh my goodness.
This is Joey Diaz.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,570
And when Joey Diaz couldn't figure out
the headphones.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,560
Welcome folks was going on.
We are in the middle of building ncn.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,570
I've,
I've heard the rumor,

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,810
the thing that you got us kicked off on
really the last time that we spoke to

12
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:45,410
you.
We were doing a kickstarter campaign to

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,120
build Antionne and it was like three
years ago and we're in the middle of

14
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:55,121
another one because we started building
it and we need a little more money to

15
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:59,540
finish the interior.
Now we've got a three story,

16
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:04,541
12,000 square foot building with a new
roof and incredible spaces to exhibit

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,850
visionary art.
So it's,

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,170
it's there and I guess it's just a
matter of time,

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,620
uh,
about finishing it and more money

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,800
weekend,
the quicker we'll be able to finish it.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,320
Are there images of it right now
currently in,

22
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,660
in construction that people can view?
Oh look at that,

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,340
Jim said,
Whoa,

24
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:28,040
that's amazing.
Where did you get that?

25
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,870
Looks like really old brick.
That's cool.

26
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:32,630
Looking brick 18.
80 two was built in.

27
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:36,290
It said we were saving the carriage
house from 1882.

28
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,030
So explain the process.
So it started out as a carriage house.

29
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,580
Yup.
And you save part of it?

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,680
Yes,
we surrounded it.

31
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,671
Wow.
Oh,

32
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:50,950
so we surrounded it with art side.
The building low.

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,860
Jamie,
scroll back up.

34
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,790
Hold on.
Don't go anywhere.

35
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,310
Get back up to the top one that you.
Yeah,

36
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,450
look at that.
Wow.

37
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:59,200
That's just one room on the third floor.
That's where the sake.

38
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,620
Okay.
We're just going to be three floors.

39
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,640
Yeah,
we're going to put criss cross kind of

40
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,970
scaffold a lattice across the angels.
Um,

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,610
let's see.
On my instagram,

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,410
I suppose there's a more recent feed of
the interior now.

43
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:18,480
We've gone a couple of the actual
angels.

44
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,880
They were 10 angels in the previous,
um,

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,050
chapel installation there in New York
City.

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,150
And I always wanted to,

47
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,920
he went to the wrong Alex Grey went to
some way.

48
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,200
Yeah.
Yeah,

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,180
that's relevant,
isn't it?

50
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,310
It is.
It as well.

51
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:40,870
Let's see.
So there's the space,

52
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,790
there's one of the angels over there
that's a uh,

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,050
yeah,
well this,

54
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,510
this is the plan to corner one of the
angels or the four corners that,

55
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,800
uh,
the direction of the building that we're

56
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:04,801
kind of recycling the carriage house has
the corners of the buildings pointing in

57
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:09,280
the cardinal directions.
So I thought that a feature of them

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,220
there will be angels or the North South,
east,

59
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,430
west,
and part of the whole thing is getting

60
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,430
the four quadrants together on top of
the building.

61
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,420
There's a steeple head that is basically
a four faced being that,

62
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,010
that is the people,
the four directions coming together.

63
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,670
Envisionary oneness.
So it's as a building,

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,500
it's a big basically godhead.
And

65
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,830
is that a real image of the actual
outside of the building with the angel

66
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:39,300
on it?
No,

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,133
that's that.

68
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,100
Yeah,
that's the computer a model that was

69
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:50,101
made by one of the Disney animators,
Ryan toddle.

70
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,660
He's a guy that is responsible for
running the,

71
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,120
uh,
one of the digital animation teams that

72
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:03,121
did Zootopia and frozen.
And he's an amazing a modeler.

73
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,653
Go back to that.

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,280
Look at this outside of this building
that might be the coolest looking

75
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,840
building on the planet earth.
Go up a little,

76
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,400
but you'll see a,
one of the coolest things about the

77
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:15,520
video that,
uh,

78
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,830
is in there is that it shows that kind
of spin around of the building itself

79
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,340
that was done by these amazing nurse
that's from the front.

80
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,200
So you've got a kind of evolutionary
thing going on on the side.

81
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,800
Oh yeah.
And then it gets to the,

82
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:36,570
uh,
the front door,

83
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,980
which is Adam and eve,
uh,

84
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,710
creating a better world.
So it kind of brings together those

85
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,770
mythologies of those narratives of
development.

86
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,450
Can you,
can you zoom in on the Adam and eve?

87
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,970
Jamie,
is it a zoom as it is guys?

88
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:56,040
Is that a caduceus in the middle of
them?

89
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,580
Not See,

90
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,660
actually down below a way down below.
There's a,

91
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,930
um,
it,

92
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,890
there you get to see.
Oh Wow.

93
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,290
So you really did the caduceus and then
sort of replicated the DNA,

94
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,000
which a lot of people believe was what
the caduceus was based on the first

95
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:14,740
place,
right?

96
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,630
[inaudible].
It's all growing out of some mushrooms

97
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:21,200
there at the base.
Alex did the drawing and then it was

98
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:24,680
sculpted in teak.
Whoa.

99
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,520
Full size four by eight foot doors.
There's two of them.

100
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,780
And then we had it scanned.
We got a grant to have it scanned and

101
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:36,560
then it'll be on the door in metal.
So it will be cast in metal.

102
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,700
The originals will be on view inside
because they're made of teak

103
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,730
friendships.
So it's what kind of metals are going to

104
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:47,120
be cast in bronze site.
Wow.

105
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,760
That is so cool.
Yeah.

106
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,990
And so what is going on with the
evolution thing?

107
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,010
So the evolution,
there's the lower hominids they become

108
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,180
homo erectus.
And then what does that child like thing

109
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:04,970
with arms up in the air?
Well,

110
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,050
I wanted to add,
thanks for noticing that.

111
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,150
I'm on the end of this paint brush,
which is kind of flying up and

112
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,010
indicating a kind of upward trajectory.
There's a drip coming off of it and that

113
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,030
drip also act like an eyeball.
The center of the eyeball is the earth.

114
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,880
And uh,
there's a skeleton,

115
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,090
a child and the person who is fully
ground woman and man on either side and

116
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,760
they each are reaching for the planet.
Now that question is,

117
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,440
who's going to get the ball?
Basically the skeleton or the human?

118
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,720
Yeah,
a will that,

119
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,870
will we be handing this to the next
generation or are we just going to blow

120
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,630
it?
So the skeleton sorta represents death

121
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,800
yet represents the end of the line for
the human species,

122
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,370
for anybody is a.
didn't even introduce your page.

123
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,820
The instagram page is what does it.
Was it Alex?

124
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:10,800
Great.
Column C O s m [inaudible].

125
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,690
This is a build [inaudible] dot com.
This is the,

126
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm a kickstarter.
Then how long has it been going on for

127
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,150
now?
I'd say about 20 days

128
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,290
were there.
We have a 40 day campaign.

129
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,810
We're about three times where we were
less.

130
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,960
We did this a campaign the same length,
the same days,

131
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,040
three years ago in 2013.
And we're three times ahead of where we

132
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:33,650
were.
I wait,

133
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,930
we,
we actually,

134
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:39,820
um,
well we did 160 percent of our goal the

135
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:41,050
last time.
So we're,

136
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,370
we're,
you know,

137
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,980
we're challenging ourselves to even
higher.

138
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,120
What I meant was how long has it been
under construction?

139
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,800
How long it's been since September of
Twenty

140
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,830
15.
Okay.

141
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,620
So you're,
you're,

142
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,090
so,
you're an obit.

143
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,880
Um,
so what is the ultimate end date where

144
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,730
you believe this all be constructed?
Well,

145
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,680
it really depends on the money that we
raised to do the exterior.

146
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,770
The interior we're going to have done by
2017 and we're aiming at the winter of

147
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,350
2017.
It should be doable,

148
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,110
you know,
everybody's telling us

149
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,960
this is the interior will open the
exhibition and then we'll see,

150
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,890
you know,
who knows.

151
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,390
I mean there's,
there's indications that,

152
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,420
you know,
like you don't know how much money's

153
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,070
going to come in.
This campaign is only to finish the

154
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:39,130
exhibition interiorly and then uh,
you know,

155
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:42,100
if we still,
which I think we will need to raise

156
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:47,101
another at one point $5,000,000 to do
the sculpture or exterior,

157
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,410
which is done by a three d print out.
It's a three d print out 20 feet high by

158
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
eight by eight.
And what is the substance?

159
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:58,110
It's manner.
Well,

160
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,280
it'll be finished in a glass reinforced
cast concrete,

161
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:06,150
but you print out the foam,
then you make the mold,

162
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,050
you make a fiberglass mold.
There's about a couple of dozen molds

163
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,700
that will be needed to do the sculptures
and there's a place right across the

164
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:17,400
river from us.
Thirty minutes away that does this.

165
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,140
So that's convenient.
Oh yeah.

166
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,710
We were thinking coming to California,
there are places that do it out here,

167
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:25,200
but uh,
we found a place so close and they're

168
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,880
doing the Brooklyn Academy of Music and
some of the big buildings in the city.

169
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,590
Has anybody done anything even remotely

170
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,460
like this?
Well,

171
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:39,461
you'll see theme parks where things are,
but the glass reinforced cast concrete

172
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,830
will make it enduring,
you know,

173
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:45,230
like it,
it'll be if they don't knock it down

174
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,560
with a wrecking ball,
it'll be there in a thousand years.

175
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,220
That's the building itself is a tomb.
I mean,

176
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:52,740
it's,
it's,

177
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,030
it's made to be a enduring.

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,920
That's our mission.
So the mission is to have this thing

179
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:03,190
survive you.
The mission is to build an enduring

180
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:06,400
sanctuary,
visionary art,

181
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,490
to uplift a global community.
That's our actual mission.

182
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,940
Do you guys have a caretaker when you
pass?

183
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:15,820
Have you already thought of like when
you move on to the next dimension,

184
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:18,310
who's going to take over this thing?
It's a church

185
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,490
is that it became a church in 2008 and
so the church churches generally a run

186
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:29,020
by the it's board and the staff that
works there,

187
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:31,150
but you know,
the board of directors are the people

188
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:34,960
that owned the church.
We actually lived there,

189
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:38,560
but our house that we built there will
be long to the church.

190
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,450
Everything we're doing there will belong
to them.

191
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,010
It's a 40 acre compound basically in the
Hudson valley seed.

192
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,400
Uh,
that's,

193
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,090
that's where it's happening.
There's 21 people working there now.

194
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,600
Wow.
I trust you guys with a church.

195
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,260
No,
I don't trust a whole lot of people.

196
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,810
I go,
yeah,

197
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,400
they're not gonna.
They're not going to get crazy.

198
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,750
But what I would worry about if I was
establishing a church is not me.

199
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,990
I would worry about what people are
going to distort the message afterwards.

200
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,920
Oh yeah.
That's always the real issue.

201
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,610
The real issue is whenever you have
something that you're going to call a

202
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:18,380
church or religion or have a sacred area
where you take it very,

203
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:21,500
very seriously,
you're going to have at least one person

204
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:26,060
who has an elevated
profile.

205
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,010
You know there's going to be one person
or people who run this thing that other

206
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:33,980
people are going to look at like they
are different than us.

207
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,350
They are elevated.
They are the people that are in charge

208
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:38,720
of this,
and when people have that feeling that

209
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,820
they feel like they're the elevated one
guy,

210
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:42,860
that gets tricky.
That's so slippery.

211
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,120
It's so hard for people to manage.
Here's one of the ways that we try to

212
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:50,240
avoid it because we never claimed to be
enlightened ourselves.

213
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,590
You know,
we're aren't as well.

214
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:52,424
I trust you.
Yeah.

215
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,363
Where

216
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,210
we're creative artists and like a lot of
artists,

217
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:03,211
we feel like when we're really doing our
thing that there's a spiritual element

218
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,200
of that,
that your creativity and spirituality

219
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:11,350
somehow seem like they're very strongly
connected.

220
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,080
There isn't any mythology about it.
You know,

221
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,230
if we're basically emanations of a
cosmos that's creative than we're little

222
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,240
embodiments of creative energy and that
creative energy can be used for the

223
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:33,331
positive or the negative in how you,
and it comes from the way that you view

224
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,800
the world,
how you're going to take that.

225
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,460
And so as an emanation of creative
energy and artists is just a,

226
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,280
you know,
like an obvious symbol of that.

227
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,920
And uh,
so we see that throughout history that

228
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,670
all the religions,
whether they agreed or disagreed,

229
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,330
all used creative expression to get
their message out.

230
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,850
And so it's one of the things that
unites all the different wisdom

231
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:08,350
traditions and unites a lot of other
stuff that's out that would consider

232
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:10,720
itself outside of religion as well.

233
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,200
I feel that creativity itself is the
original kind of religious impulse that

234
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,370
it's the way of knowing oneself,
the way of knowing God.

235
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,440
It's a,
it's a means of worship.

236
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,120
I mean,
we look at the,

237
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,470
the cave art and you say,
you know,

238
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,570
they weren't talking about sex or
something or disagreeing necessarily as

239
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,720
religious kind of ideas and things like
that.

240
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:45,721
They were making a mark of meaning and
left behind something that was

241
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:51,541
meaningful to their tribe and I think
that that's still what we're trying to

242
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:53,910
do and you know,
I,

243
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,030
I think religion because it scares the
shit out of really intelligent people

244
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,610
for good reason because it's such a mess
in the world and created such a mess and

245
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:11,530
so much divisiveness.
Something that's supposed to be about

246
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:16,531
love that's caused so much heartache and
damage and so,

247
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,500
and what I think is that when I told my
friend Robert Jesse,

248
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,810
I'm from the council on spiritual
practices.

249
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,100
Well,
I'm spiritual,

250
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:31,900
but I'm not religious.
You know,

251
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,990
you saying,
you know Alex,

252
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,370
we can't let the fundamentalists own the
word religion.

253
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Russians too important a word and what
we need are courageous experiments in

254
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:53,161
religion that could help us to get to
the

255
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,890
other side of the bell curve,
the evolutionary edge.

256
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,190
Is there an evolving edge for religion?
Could we get posts secular in the world?

257
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,720
Can we imagine a world where people
have.

258
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,940
Most of the people of the world have
taken a sacrament of one kind or another

259
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,840
and have realized that there's an
infinite intelligence at the basis of

260
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:21,180
the cosmos that they are a,
you know,

261
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,300
an expression of.
And that ended life is a divine,

262
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,370
um,
display spectacle,

263
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,620
you know,
that,

264
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,110
that God's gone to a lot of trouble to
create.

265
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,633
And,
uh,

266
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,310
so,
you know,

267
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:45,290
from the perspective of today what you
know,

268
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,330
because toynbee when he was writing
about civilizations,

269
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,770
talked about,
you know,

270
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,130
every civilization needs a spiritual
core.

271
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,830
And as it planetary civilization,
you can't have one religion dominate.

272
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,530
It's impossible.
It's just not.

273
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,720
No,
it's not possible.

274
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,090
And so how do you unite a world
spiritually?

275
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,580
Well,
my candidate is create the creative

276
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:17,710
arts,
you know,

277
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,720
that all of world cultures have some
means of creative expression.

278
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:26,960
We get to know that culture through
their music,

279
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,420
through their know painting,
sculpture,

280
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,990
various kinds of things.
And that how we,

281
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,300
uh,
get to know each other and see our

282
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,040
connections,
you know,

283
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,790
and so as a potential,
you know,

284
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,460
something that's been used by all world
religions,

285
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,330
you know,
in something that has a defacto for the

286
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:55,331
people who don't believe in God anymore.
Many of them still believe that artists

287
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,090
are trying to do something authentic and
truthful to their,

288
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,760
to their inner being.

289
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,120
Isn't the word religion fairly loaded
though,

290
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,010
and what isn't,
what's important?

291
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,290
The idea behind what you're trying to
do,

292
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,300
right?
The idea is that you're trying to make

293
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,820
this sacred place.
You're trying to make this amazing place

294
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:17,420
where people can go and see expression
and see,

295
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,970
you know,
the purity of your creative vision.

296
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,020
What,
why,

297
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,210
why connect that to a loaded word?

298
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,260
Because it's,
as Jesse said in my book,

299
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:32,710
I think it's,
it's too easy

300
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,240
to run away from that.
It's a,

301
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,100
it's
a,

302
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,720
you know,
how a bad neighborhood gets,

303
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,490
you know,
and it's just like,

304
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,190
oh my God,
it's only criminal.

305
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,350
So live here.
And then some artists show up,

306
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,600
you know,
and they start having their studios and

307
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,690
various things like that.
And sooner or later,

308
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,320
a really beat up neighborhood will start
to have some vitality because creative

309
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,970
energy,
creative energy starts to infiltrate

310
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,920
into destructive energy.
What I'm saying is if the artists would

311
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:21,090
move back into the world of religion,
we might clean up the neighborhood a

312
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,380
little,
you know,

313
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
and make it a more habitable for people
to want to look at their relationship

314
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,960
with spirit through even the lens of
religion.

315
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,270
But why?
Why religion though?

316
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,970
Because religion is associated in most
people's minds,

317
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,810
the deities realia religions associated
most people's minds with aiden and

318
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:45,690
traditions,
ancient traditions that oftentimes

319
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,690
stifle your behavior,
tell you what to do,

320
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,750
control you and offer horrendous
consequences for not complying.

321
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,510
That's what a lot of people think of
when they think of the word religion.

322
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,380
So here's this thing,
but you hope,

323
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,640
but let me get to this real quick.
You have this thing,

324
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,490
this beautiful thing,
like why even put a name to it?

325
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,080
Why,
why label it?

326
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,840
And when you're labeling it,
you're connecting it with all these

327
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:13,470
other religions that are so problematic
and you're going to have to explain your

328
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,770
way out of that.
Why do that instead of just have this

329
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:20,040
amazing center,
um,

330
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,490
because I feel that we're a maintenance
lead connected with whatever that

331
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,980
religious impulse,
and if you look at the,

332
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,460
what is the primary religious experience
that is a mystical experience

333
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,380
regularly geo to reconnect,
to connect up,

334
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,600
to link back because that was the word
man.

335
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,980
Yes,
to really link to reconnect to what the

336
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,880
self to God,
the Self and God so that that's the

337
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,080
actual origin of the word.

338
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,520
Religion.
Religion says it a Latin word and

339
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,050
French,
French and it's to reconnect.

340
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:04,710
So the idea being that the religion or
these churches were set up so that

341
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:07,350
people could reconnect with God.
So they go about their day.

342
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:11,160
They were filled with troubles and
strife and all sorts of stress and they

343
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:14,610
can go back to the church and they can
reconnect with God through religion,

344
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,720
through if you go to Egypt or you go to
a.

345
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,150
You just came back from Venice and you
go to some of these religious cathedrals

346
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:30,180
that are a thousand years old.
You go to these pilgrimage places and

347
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:35,181
there is tremendous power because a lot
of people invested a lot of love and

348
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,350
energy into a center and they built a
shrine to whatever they believed that

349
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:49,521
spirit to be.
And that is part of a long tradition of

350
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,840
a connectedness with,
uh,

351
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,140
you know,
their lens into the infinite.

352
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,270
Whatever religion you're looking
through,

353
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,400
iconic,
an iconic,

354
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,380
yes,
they're a hell of lot of trouble when

355
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,200
you get to the secondary,
uh,

356
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,390
religious,
uh,

357
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,520
you know,
experience,

358
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,820
which is everything else that you think
about religion,

359
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,260
the primary religious experience.
Every religion started with a mystical

360
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:25,261
experience and people are having those
on acid every day now,

361
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,380
you know?
And so what he,

362
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:33,460
a disconnect from that whole tradition
where people were connecting to the

363
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:36,760
infinite before and you say,
this has nothing to do with that,

364
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,680
you know,
or do you say,

365
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,110
hey,
religions fucked up.

366
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,580
But what if we reimagine it?
What if we reimagined God,

367
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,500
you know,
and can't,

368
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,150
can't we do it?
And say,

369
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,920
this has a lot of,
a lot going for it.

370
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:57,940
This quest for the infinite,
absolute mystery.

371
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,330
That's at the core of our being and the
core of the cosmos.

372
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,440
This quest to know that it leads to
science that leads aren't.

373
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,130
It's the.
It's the quest to know the truth about

374
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:14,131
the nature of reality and so that quest
is another reason why I think that if

375
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,860
you harness that to creativity,
just artists,

376
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,520
artists hate dogma,
you,

377
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,730
you can't have a dogmatic.
I mean our artists always disagree and

378
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:33,640
you're always going to have new vantage
point.

379
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,990
You're always gonna have one evolving a
point of view.

380
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,320
That's part of the trouble of religion
is that they get,

381
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,230
you know,
this is the right way and it's only like

382
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:46,730
this.
We're not going to look beyond our

383
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,120
boundaries of what,
you know,

384
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:53,740
people made up long ago as the way it's
supposed to be in another century when

385
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,650
you know,
we didn't know any of the stuff that we

386
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:58,960
know now,
so that does make sense.

387
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,640
So any good religion ought to their view
of reality,

388
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,420
at least science ought to be
incorporated into it.

389
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,010
So you couldn't have a truthful religion
without science.

390
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,270
Are you planning on writing something
out like the tenants of this religion,

391
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:20,990
the ethics of this religion,
we actually have liturgy.

392
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,020
In order to become a church you have to
submit liturgy to the irs and the state

393
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:31,661
attorney general and then we had to.
I'm familiar with what's our word,

394
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,530
liturgy,
liturgy,

395
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:34,850
like a,
like a document,

396
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:35,661
like a,
you know,

397
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:38,290
like stuff that you use on a regular
basis in,

398
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,620
in your ceremonies,
so you have that in order to be

399
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:46,040
recognized for it don't have to do,

400
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,490
but it's part of the irs a requirement
and estate attorney.

401
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,000
Do you have a liturgy?
Liturgy?

402
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,140
You can say no.
Yeah,

403
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,580
you probably could probably apply and
maybe you know,

404
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,800
it's all in your head relax.
It's like a guy has to look over what

405
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:07,280
you're doing and really question it and
see if you've thought it out and stuff

406
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,350
like that.
Alex published art psalms,

407
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,320
which was a poetry book and you've seen
so that was really submitted.

408
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,510
That was submitted as our,
as cosmic liturgy.

409
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,120
Perfect.
Um,

410
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,310
well that's,
that's work is really fascinating is the

411
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:27,311
tax exempt status of religion.
Religion is so odd in that way,

412
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,120
that worshiping and being in a place
where you worship,

413
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,820
even if it's very clear that there's a
lot of profit being made,

414
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,980
you don't have to pay taxes on that.
I just want to tell you this little,

415
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,470
just a touch of the history of why we
became a church because it wasn't really

416
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:46,760
ever our intention to become a church
all the way from the beginning when we

417
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,670
19,
85 and we visioned the temple

418
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,260
simultaneously.
Alex and I on our first Mtma a journey

419
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,080
lying on the bed.
We both came out of it having vision.

420
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:01,730
This circular,
a building in 1985.

421
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:06,790
We had recently moved to New York
together doing mdm back in 1985.

422
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,530
Jesus,
but we both saw this temple and we knew

423
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:18,170
that this was sort of like our,
our joint mission.

424
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:20,030
This was the thing we were going to do
together.

425
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,250
You know Alex always.
We met in art school,

426
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:25,880
so Alex always had his art and I had my
art and we shared a studio,

427
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,340
but this was something we were going to
do together.

428
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:32,820
So we never thought we would become a
church to know,

429
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,680
but here we were building the sacred
site and then all through our life

430
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,790
together,
you know,

431
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,910
we uh,
started visiting sacred sites like we

432
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:45,390
just came from St Mark's and Venice and
we see sharp cathedral and you know,

433
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,250
we go there with groups of people and
you know,

434
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,010
like go on pilgrimage to these sacred
beauty,

435
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,390
beautiful art places.
But anyway,

436
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,820
uh,
the way we became a church was um,

437
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,740
a friend of ours who started Sirius
satellite network.

438
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,140
Actually,
she's Martine Rothblatt,

439
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,220
but she,
she loves the work that a actual lives.

440
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,600
Alex's work,
she's a collector,

441
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,660
she loves the work.
We're doing awesome with the community

442
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:13,070
and all this.
And she said,

443
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,430
you know,
you're doing everything that churches

444
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:16,850
do.
You're doing weddings,

445
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,280
baby blessings and morals.
You have,

446
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,320
you have a prayer book,
you know,

447
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,710
basically arts and you're doing
everything that churches do and you're

448
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:28,690
not getting any of the benefits of what
churches get business thinking.

449
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,380
No,
she's so smart.

450
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,420
Really?
And she paid a lawyer.

451
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:35,840
She is the one that funded,
granted us,

452
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,490
you know,
getting together with our,

453
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,460
with our guy who,
who when we went through the process

454
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:43,010
with us,
it took a good long time.

455
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,070
You have to basically write a lot of
essays and then they give you more

456
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:51,630
essays and it was maybe three times
through essays and you write them all

457
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:56,100
and then you submit the liturgy and
eventually just at the moment we were

458
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:57,060
moving to the country.

459
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,500
It was like the same minute.
The church status just magically came in

460
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,440
after four years.
It was like all like coming together,

461
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:06,630
you know,
so as it is though,

462
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:10,440
we have 40 acres and then we had to
fight with our town over,

463
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,140
you know,
every church in our town and there's

464
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,760
every,
there's mosques and Buddhist stupas and

465
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,650
you know,
lots of Catholic and every kind of

466
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,770
Protestant.
And they were not paying real estate tax

467
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:26,970
and we have this 40 acres and they were
raising our taxes 15 percent every year.

468
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,040
Meanwhile we're not making any money.
Alex and I are volunteers that caused

469
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,480
them by the way.
And so we'd make nothing.

470
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:38,160
We just give it away and the whole place
we're giving away it belongs to the

471
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:43,161
community and the community is everybody
whose spiritual and creative,

472
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,000
but it tends to have a lot of
psychedelia files.

473
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,680
People who feel like they've,
they've experienced the divine and they

474
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:54,840
want a place to go ahead and talk about
it.

475
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,410
They wanted this in the city when we
were in Manhattan for five years.

476
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:03,030
It was just a place where you could go
and talk about this because it's legal

477
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,720
to talk about it and we would always
have security and make sure there wasn't

478
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,170
anything being passed around because we
can't get into trouble because we were

479
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:14,010
like a really legitimate.
We're doing this in legitimate way.

480
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:17,550
We have to took us four years to get our
permits to do this building.

481
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,060
You add security to make sure that
people didn't pass drugs around.

482
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,700
Well,
we can't have anything visible.

483
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,050
What you do that is private is your own
business.

484
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:29,850
If you can behave yourself,
we don't.

485
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,900
We watch out for you and we.
I understand that,

486
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:37,890
but you had a bunch of people actually
watching people to make sure we always

487
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:38,580
have security.

488
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,890
They're gentle giants.
We call them gentle giants.

489
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,690
You have to have security when you're
having.

490
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,040
We have hundreds of thousands.
Well,

491
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,380
some of our full moons are from hundreds
to a thousand people.

492
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:53,930
We have large groups of people.
That's what,

493
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,480
what happened was a sham and told us
that,

494
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,130
uh,
we,

495
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,840
we,
we had this whole idea of this temple we

496
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,700
wanted to build,
but where's your community?

497
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,680
You know,
building a temple is the work of a

498
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,760
community.
He said,

499
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,080
so we're going to start full moon
ceremonies in your home in Brooklyn.

500
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,030
So we did.
We started in January of 2,364

501
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,250
consecutive,
full moons ago.

502
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,970
We started them in our loft in Brooklyn
and then we went to,

503
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,300
we got a place in Manhattan,
12,000 square feet.

504
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:29,301
We did it for five years.
Then we found this permanent location in

505
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,010
a whopping journey.
York,

506
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,550
it's in the Hudson Valley.

507
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,140
We were like 65 miles from the city.
You can get there on the train,

508
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:42,230
but we found this lovely old retreat
center all kind of imploding and you

509
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,190
know,
and we've been working on at one

510
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:47,380
building at a time,
the carriage house,

511
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:51,310
which is turning into an theone,
the first temple of visionary art that

512
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,760
we really came there to build his
building for.

513
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:00,060
Actually we have a 10 bedroom Victorian
guesthouse and a office in our studio.

514
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,210
So we have,
you know,

515
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,680
we have six buildings to work on and
we're on building for.

516
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,910
But uh,
anyway,

517
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,860
that's.
This is like a little retreat center

518
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:12,400
that we're leaving to our community,
our spiritual,

519
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:14,920
creative cosmonaut community.

520
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,810
It's fascinating that Martin was
involved in it because she's also

521
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:22,620
involved in artificial intelligence.
I interviewed her for the Scifi show

522
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,230
that I did.
Yeah.

523
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,230
And she has this robot version of her
wife Bina four,

524
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,810
eight,
48 or whatever.

525
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,120
Yeah.
Well,

526
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,680
she started a church.
She being a started a church called the

527
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,320
terrorism movement.
We need to start a church.

528
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:44,010
You should.
Joey Diaz already has a church,

529
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:49,080
which he just joined his
Joey Diaz as the Church of what's

530
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,950
happening now.
There's some great churches out there.

531
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,520
I really just think it's why should
these Catholics get it all?

532
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,110
You know what I mean?
We shouldn't get it all.

533
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,100
No.
I think after you involved in like the

534
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:05,980
100th child molestation,
he probably should take.

535
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,020
You're probably take it away and that's.
That's like super conservative number.

536
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,380
That's horrible.
That crazy religion.

537
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:16,980
Religion doesn't uphold that.
That's just awful people.

538
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,843
Yes,
but

539
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,290
awful people all throughout that one
religion.

540
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,350
I mean there's gotta be some sort of a
connection with suppression,

541
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:27,100
suppression of Sexuality,
suppression of ideology,

542
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,280
forcing people to behave in a certain
way and these blow backs and the also

543
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,500
the fear.
I mean I was raised Catholic and I went

544
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,740
to Catholic school when I was a young
kid and I remember I didn't go to

545
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:40,480
kindergarten.
I just went right into first grade and I

546
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,290
remember the fear,
the constant fear that they injected in

547
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,810
you this,
this idea of what religion is.

548
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,580
It was great for me because it,
it just queered me off religion so

549
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:53,590
young.
So early off I was like,

550
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,191
oh,
okay,

551
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:57,220
well this is all nonsense was before
that.

552
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,490
When I was young,
my parents were getting divorced and my

553
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,250
parents are splitting up.
I was really scared.

554
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,790
I was really nervous and I was young and
there was a lot of violence going

555
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,250
around.

556
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:12,250
There was a lot of yelling and screaming
and I needed something and so I remember

557
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,270
when I was little I was always talking
about God and it was just like,

558
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,230
well,
there's got to be.

559
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,010
If all these people around me are out of
their mind and everyone's crazy,

560
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,250
there's got to be God.
So I was actually excited to go to

561
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:26,110
Catholic school.
I was excited to go to church.

562
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,350
I thought of it as well,
me,

563
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,130
maybe these people that these relatives
in these family members that I live with

564
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,320
are all crazy,
but there's going to be a place that I

565
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:39,280
can go where I'm going to be able to be
loved and it's going to be calm.

566
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,120
God has rules and everyone's gonna
follow them,

567
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,610
and then I went there and I was like,
Oh,

568
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,040
good Lord.
No Pun intended.

569
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,030
This fucking places worse.
I was like,

570
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,340
these people out of their minds and my.

571
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,400
My parents were going to put me in there
for second grade and I literally told

572
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:57,650
him I'd run away from home.
I was like,

573
00:32:57,651 --> 00:32:59,210
I'm going to find my way out of this.
I'm like,

574
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,140
I'm not doing this,
and it was seven,

575
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,361
you know?
I was like,

576
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,150
this is not happening.
Well,

577
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,580
you have already become rational.
It's seven.

578
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,280
You knew
you had a bullshit detector that was

579
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:17,120
always acutely attuned.
Well,

580
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:22,121
that's one good thing about growing up
in a really fucked up household is that

581
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:23,600
like you,
you,

582
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,410
you're,
you're,

583
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,920
you have a constant sense of danger
because you're around danger all the

584
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:30,230
time.
So you don't get to sleep cuddly.

585
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,120
You don't get to like rest calm and you,
you,

586
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:37,250
you have an acute awareness of all the
possibilities.

587
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,910
So I mean ultimately that was a great
thing for me.

588
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,450
I can,
I can really see how that it heightened

589
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:49,451
your ability to also to always maintain
that mindfulness,

590
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,090
that over everything.

591
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,730
It's what,
it probably allows you to do so many

592
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:56,840
things.
It's also,

593
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,341
there's,
you know,

594
00:33:57,341 --> 00:34:00,710
there's always a balance between
mindfulness and paranoia.

595
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:02,930
You don't want to be that guy that
carries a gun to the bathroom.

596
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,741
You know,
there's,

597
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:07,030
I know a lot of people that have
surpassed this,

598
00:34:07,031 --> 00:34:10,010
uh,
awareness and gone into this like acute

599
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:12,620
paranoia.
I have this statement that I've been

600
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:15,080
saying a lot lately,
but I think it's important to bring up.

601
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,500
I don't think human beings are designed
to take in the bad news of 7 billion

602
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:22,640
people.
I just don't think.

603
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,780
I think the numbers that we deal with on
a daily basis with all the different

604
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:30,080
stories of the world,
they are too much for us to handle.

605
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:34,340
It's not how you're supposed to deal
with what's going on in your community

606
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,250
with a watchful eye on the rest of the
world.

607
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,110
You shouldn't be deeply engrossed in all
of the most disgusting aspects of the

608
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:43,880
rest of the world.
Twenty four hours a day.

609
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:47,630
And I think that's one of the real
problematic issues of our time with

610
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:52,631
social media and with the news that
people have this distorted sense of what

611
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:56,750
the world is.
They think this world is just filled

612
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:58,760
with violence and horror.
No,

613
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,480
the world is fine.
It just occasionally has violence and

614
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,410
horror.
There's just so many people and the

615
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:11,411
world is so big that if you look at all
those people and this giant globe that

616
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:15,530
we're on,
then you can kind of get a sense that

617
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,470
the sky is falling,
but you know,

618
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,880
but if you go outside right now in
woodland hills,

619
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,060
it's beautiful.
It's nice.

620
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,820
It's always the worst thing happening in
every area.

621
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,340
Sometimes it's not,
but it's so rare.

622
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:31,280
It's like occasionally they give you
some good food with her feet and your

623
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:32,600
poison.
You're about to die.

624
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,910
They slip you a piece of fruit.

625
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,570
Just.
I just don't think it's good for us.

626
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,080
I don't think it is and I think that's
the same thing with someone who grows up

627
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,580
in a bad environment.
I think you could.

628
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,630
You could get a distorted perception of
what the world is and think that that

629
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,200
the bad environment that you're
currently in is the entire world and it

630
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:56,730
can shape your perceptions and your
interactions and therefore shape how you

631
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:59,970
react to other people and shape your
actual reality.

632
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,740
You know,
it's one of the things that have truly

633
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:06,540
tried to impart upon people that I've
learned and I believe that how you treat

634
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:10,500
people and your interactions with people
literally change your reality,

635
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,220
and this is from mistakes that I've made
and this is from positive

636
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,900
decisions that I've made because I think
that when you look at life in a positive

637
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:24,940
way and you try to treat people kind and
you try to be nice to people and you try

638
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:28,560
to move forward with that,
the people that you interact with,

639
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,550
they will get that.
They will most likely respond more

640
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:36,570
kindly to you and the world changes.
The world literally changes in front of

641
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:37,890
you.
It's billiard balls.

642
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,690
Yeah.
You know,

643
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,690
have have kind act that could be sending
waves.

644
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,510
A smile could actually prevent somebody
from committing suicide.

645
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,850
That's all it takes.
Maybe you should just go ahead and end

646
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:53,684
it.

647
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Well,
I heard from some from some kids who are

648
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,230
really desperate and I going to jump or
am I

649
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,350
not?
Some stranger looked at me and smiled.

650
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,620
That's and that stopped me from doing
it.

651
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,160
Alex,
what still have meat?

652
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,530
Acid stopped me from,
from killing myself

653
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,830
because for me,
I wondered whether God exists.

654
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:25,500
Just like your question when you were
seven,

655
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:30,501
you were hoping that there was something
that was not a it,

656
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,670
you know,
that there was a center of peace

657
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,550
somewhere.
I guess now I don't know that I would

658
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,760
ever call God at center of peace.
You know,

659
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,940
I would say that that's one aspect of
the entire,

660
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,990
you know,
meet storm of being alive.

661
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,100
I love that word,

662
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,610
but what I read express,
meet storm.

663
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:59,611
You should make a t shirt
says meets dorm.

664
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,300
That's a great band.
Radical band.

665
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,540
Hudson Valley.
Meet Storm.

666
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,460
We have a grinder attached to industrial
fan folks.

667
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,920
I wouldn't think about it that way.
I was thinking about a bunch of people

668
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:16,480
just jumping around,
getting crazy.

669
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,373
There you go.

670
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:23,920
Word.
Well,

671
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,400
I thought of that when I saw the last
judgment,

672
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:28,450
but I make glands.
Well,

673
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,920
speaking of Catholics,
so you gotta look at the good things

674
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,520
like even probably some really terrible
stuff happened in those Howard halls in

675
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,800
the Vatican,
but again,

676
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,060
really awesome art.

677
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

678
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,630
Have you ever seen the Sistine Chapel?
No,

679
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:52,670
I'm actually going there this summer.
We spent an entire day from nine until

680
00:38:52,671 --> 00:38:53,720
five.
We got there,

681
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:58,721
the front of the line and got in
the way all the way there.

682
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,110
You got to run all the way through the
Vatican.

683
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,940
Well to know you don't want to do that.
Yeah,

684
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,050
you do.
Why do you want to run?

685
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,710
Well,
we went to Chapel Sistine Chapel.

686
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,140
Oh,
so you got to take it and then get there

687
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:16,640
in time when it kicks in.
We were there all day from nine to five

688
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,960
drawing.
We just sat.

689
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:22,010
We got a seat and we were just drawing
all day and our focus,

690
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,330
it was just unbelievable and the
drawings came out really amazing too.

691
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,080
And so we had been to Vatican before,
I have to say.

692
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:31,700
So when you go to the Vatican for the
first time,

693
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:35,200
you have to walk through so you can see
all the amazingness of the way there

694
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,450
because the sistine chapel is at the end
of the tour,

695
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,640
you know,
you'd go out there and then afterwards

696
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:42,080
you come back.
So.

697
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,921
So you,
you know,

698
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:46,220
on the way you want to take a look,
but we had already done that so we were

699
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:51,221
like made the decision,
this was our day to draw man,

700
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:52,520
you know,
so I got it.

701
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,330
I just,
that was all I wanted to see.

702
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:56,164
Anyway.
So it,

703
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,260
everything else is just a blur and then
you get to the Sistine Chapel is quite

704
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:06,010
fascinating that you're looking at the
work of someone who lived hundreds of

705
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,270
years,
500 years ago.

706
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,170
Amazing.

707
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,800
And he didn't like everything that
Castle Catholics did by the way.

708
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,570
He did.
Well he didn't,

709
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:16,000
but he did like being Catholic.
Okay.

710
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:17,770
He,
he really did.

711
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:21,020
He wrote about it and was very eloquent
and he loved being healthy,

712
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:25,510
but he didn't like the pope telling him
to paint the Sistine Chapel for

713
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:26,460
instance.
Look at that,

714
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,260
look at that.
How long did it take for him to do that?

715
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:29,320
I

716
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,130
don't know.
Years and years.

717
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,160
They last judgment is the one that was,
I guess I've always called my favorite

718
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,490
painting of all time.
That's the meat storm.

719
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,380
It's like a,
you know,

720
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:46,450
and there were no clothes.
I'm a figures on that.

721
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:51,050
They,
Michelangelo was still alive when they

722
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:51,940
got,
um,

723
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,030
a,
uh,

724
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,340
what they called it,
uh,

725
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,120
he was,
uh,

726
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,120
he was a good fresco painter,
but he became basically Michelangelo's

727
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:03,500
breaches,
painter,

728
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,320
you know,
he was always thought of as the one who

729
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:07,850
added,
you know,

730
00:41:07,851 --> 00:41:12,851
clothing and drapery over the genitalia
that Michelangelo had painted.

731
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,900
He loved the body and he,
uh,

732
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,030
made one,
I would call an anthropocosm out of it,

733
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:27,590
want a kind of a temple of humanity.
And it was very much about the nobility

734
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,990
and connected with the Greek idealist.
That Greek idealist tradition is a

735
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:41,450
psychedelic tradition from the
neoplatonic in the platonic,

736
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,760
you know,
socrates and all the rest.

737
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,010
So that wave was just getting,
uh,

738
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,050
he,
he was there when they dug up.

739
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,310
They,
Lao coon,

740
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,150
you know,
the Greek sculpture with the snakes and

741
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,870
the crazy stuff that it really deeply
influenced him.

742
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,620
I just wanted to say that the purity of
the religion place where it,

743
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,200
it's really true,
you know,

744
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:07,810
like that beautiful,
you know,

745
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,460
what would it actually means at the,
at the core,

746
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:14,390
at the heart core of any religion is
expressed through the art of that

747
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:15,980
religion.
So you know,

748
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:18,770
the other stuff is crap.
You know what I mean with the way people

749
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,690
act towards each other and stuff.
That's their own deficits and their own

750
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:25,110
obstacles coming out,
you know,

751
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,070
all over the place.
Even the pope's that have been horrible

752
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:29,450
and allowed,
you know,

753
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,400
uh,
you know,

754
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,560
child molestation to perpetrate those
people are sick people that has nothing.

755
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,110
They don't represent the purity of the
religion,

756
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:41,000
which is the representative and they
are.

757
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,670
But what is that?
What is the purity of the religion and

758
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:46,370
doesn't vary depending upon the
individual.

759
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:48,250
And why does it,
why does that?

760
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:51,320
I don't think anybody,
every religion that what we're seeing is

761
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:53,570
the purity of one man's expression.
His,

762
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,440
his view is beautiful view of the world.
That we're so fortunate to be able to

763
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,290
still look at

764
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:01,660
true 500 years later.
What does that have to do with

765
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:06,640
Catholicism?
I think that because he was part of that

766
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,700
tradition and he was marrying the ideas
of the Greek ideal and the ended

767
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,500
neoplatonic,
uh,

768
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,580
which was all about universality,
you know,

769
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,240
it was really more about it.
They,

770
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:27,310
as much as we're saying,
you know,

771
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,600
all religions are connected and are
basically talking about the,

772
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,510
the one spirit that moves through all of
us.

773
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,590
You can call it creative spirit and I
prefer to call it something like that

774
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,420
rather than,
uh,

775
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,530
some of the names that get so heavily
weighted.

776
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,100
But I'm comfortable with the word God.
To me,

777
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:51,480
God means just ultimate mystery.
Yeah.

778
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,950
We discussed this a couple times on
previous podcasts though.

779
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,770
How weighted that word is.
It is.

780
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:58,000
Well,
one of the things that I think is

781
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:02,290
amazing about the Sistine Chapel,
when you're looking at the two fingers

782
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,700
touching,
when you're looking at all these

783
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:05,770
beautiful images,
those images,

784
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:11,430
they become what people think of when
they think of God and they think of

785
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:14,590
religion.
Those images,

786
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:20,250
they almost like it takes a form on and
in taking on that form,

787
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:25,801
it gives you a structure to house the
ideas and the ideals of these religions.

788
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,670
Like in seeing something,
a visual representation,

789
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,160
it

790
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,160
becomes a real thing in that.
It's an idea that's an idea that becomes

791
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,360
embodied by that art.

792
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:44,240
I grew up in the Jewish tradition,
which is a non iconic tradition and you

793
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,650
know,
this is the Christian tradition really

794
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:49,200
is.
It is a story of a person.

795
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,480
They were born,
they taught,

796
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:52,440
they,
they healed,

797
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,880
they died,
they rose.

798
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,140
And in the Jewish tradition there is,
it's an non embodied.

799
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,250
So I,
you know,

800
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:04,610
I resonated with that when I first saw
God in Lsd and it was really not a

801
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:08,910
person's face at all.
But I recognize that this is what people

802
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:10,440
are talking about when they're talking
about God,

803
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,240
which is this energy that's,
you know,

804
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,880
interconnects everything,
you know,

805
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:18,780
it's like the force more than a face.
So,

806
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,990
but that was my experience of God and I.
and,

807
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:24,120
and,
and in that experience when I was 20,

808
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,170
I recognize this is what people are
talking about when they say God,

809
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,150
it's not physical.

810
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,220
Yeah.
Energetic.

811
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,540
What I'm just saying is that in this guy
creating these iconic works,

812
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,220
yes,
he gives it a structure.

813
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,760
It gives it like a scaffolding.
And in that scaffolding of these

814
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,840
beautiful paintings,
you can kind of like form your own

815
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:50,841
categories and have your own like
chapters in your mind that exists that

816
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,340
someone,
it's almost like makes those things

817
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:55,470
real.
Whether or not they ever were real,

818
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,450
whether or not they're ever angels on
clouds,

819
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,990
it's almost inconsequential because the,
the result of it is kind of the same.

820
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,850
If you believe that it's real.
If you believe,

821
00:46:05,851 --> 00:46:10,851
and this is where religion gets so
fucking squirrely because are you saying

822
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:13,740
that Adam and eve were the only two
people in the world and everybody came

823
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:14,551
from them?
No,

824
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:17,340
absolutely not.
Are you saying that there was a snake

825
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,730
and he told eve?
No,

826
00:46:18,731 --> 00:46:18,980
no,
no,

827
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,211
no,
no,

828
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:19,620
no,
no,

829
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,010
no.

830
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:25,010
But if you operate your life as if those
things were reality,

831
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,480
and if you operate your life under the
ideals that are transcribed and

832
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:35,510
described in these beautiful paintings,
it will become a real past in the sense

833
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:40,410
that it will have a real meaning to you.
It gets real weird in that way.

834
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,710
And that's where I create weird art in
general.

835
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,711
And your art is particularly important
because the things that you paint,

836
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,700
you can actually see.
I've seen a lot of the things that you

837
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:56,490
paint.
Maybe not specifically,

838
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:00,960
but one of the things that I remember
when I was first introduced to some of

839
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:02,970
your art,
I am,

840
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,700
I saw,
I forget which one it was.

841
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,800
I forget what you have seen so many of
your pieces,

842
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:09,180
but I remember going,
oh,

843
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:12,570
this guy's seen it like 100 percent.
You've been there.

844
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,380
Like when I thought of tryptamine
experiences and I saw your art,

845
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:16,921
I was like,
oh,

846
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:17,650
this guy,
he's a.

847
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,900
He nailed it.
I mean,

848
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:22,160
some people have come kind of close.
They've kind of.

849
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:27,530
But even though what you're showing,
it doesn't exist in a static form,

850
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,560
in the tryptamine dimension,
like there's no way you can take a,

851
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,890
you know,
you take your phone and you take a

852
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,290
screenshot and you don't,
you want to,

853
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,110
when you're in there,
you went to press that button and say,

854
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,400
God is,
say that now.

855
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,160
That's good.
Now can I just press the movie?

856
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:43,780
How can I capture this?
Well,

857
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:46,870
the problem also is it changes every
fraction of a second.

858
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,100
The,
the,

859
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,270
the beautiful thing about the tryptamine
experiences is that whatever visual

860
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:55,630
you're experiencing right now will morph
into something else.

861
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,430
And it was one of the most important
lessons that I ever learned while

862
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:04,060
tripping was um,
in a dmt experience.

863
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,060
I had a bunch of negative thoughts.

864
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,640
I don't remember what they were about,
but our member,

865
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:14,730
the visions that I was having turned
dark and like do like a dark green and

866
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:19,450
black and twisted.
Like there were contorted and

867
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:22,960
compressed,
like a visual representation of negative

868
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:26,500
thinking.
And then I realized that these,

869
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,500
whatever these things are with entities,
thoughts,

870
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:34,501
whatever they were trying to express to
me the actual negative consequences of

871
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,160
thinking like that,
that it showed me in a visual form,

872
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:44,370
and then I relaxed and thought positive.
Eddie literally bloomed in front of me

873
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:49,801
like a flower and then change into this
wildly beautiful geometric pattern that

874
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:55,450
was like dancing in front of me.
And I realized at that moment like I'm,

875
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,950
I,
I realized to myself,

876
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:58,450
I said,
I have to remember this,

877
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:01,450
I have to remember this and I have to
figure out how to express this because

878
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:05,680
this is a,
an incredible realization that it's not

879
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,800
this like abstract idea that,
oh,

880
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:10,750
you think negative,
negative things happen.

881
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:11,730
Think positive.
No,

882
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,180
you're literally manifesting energy.
You're manifesting a certain kind of

883
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:18,880
energy with negative thinking.
Or it's one of the reasons why we like

884
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:22,180
getting away from negative people when
someone's like really negative and

885
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,840
complaining and whining.
He just like,

886
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,510
oh Jesus,
I got to get outta here.

887
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,490
You're like,
you really feel like they're going to

888
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:30,490
suck me in other vortex.
I've gotta I've gotta escape.

889
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,040
Yeah,
there's,

890
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,410
there is,
um,

891
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:37,630
don't see,
you could think of it like an Amoeba

892
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:41,840
around your physical body,
cloud of

893
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:49,020
pulsating thought forms and uh,
as you're imagining a,

894
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,980
you know,
a,

895
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,040
the beautiful elements of life and
things.

896
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,460
It's,
it seems to be in a kind of order and

897
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:05,380
uh,
and maybe kind of wafting upward it.

898
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,100
These are like,
uh,

899
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,540
the,
the spiritual positive,

900
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,920
uh,
kind of frameworks.

901
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,800
Sometimes you are seeing life through
when you're tripping,

902
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,080
you know,
and seeing the connections between

903
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,450
things lines forming and things like
that.

904
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:23,530
The,
the more kind of organic geometries

905
00:50:23,531 --> 00:50:24,640
that,
that show up,

906
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,950
you see this intelligence of life and
the,

907
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,090
uh,
the,

908
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,470
the light of divine intelligence that
came through for allison,

909
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:38,471
like in the language,
it seems to be weaving things together.

910
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,920
And when you're in touch with that
infinite light that seems to be the

911
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:49,181
source,
then that is you can keep it upwardly

912
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:55,270
moving and very evolutionarily caught
cosmically consciously moving forward.

913
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:02,530
And when then you're thinking regretful
thoughts or thinking negative thoughts

914
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:08,300
and anger and things like that.
There's a constriction that goes on in

915
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:12,140
your heart I think,
and kind of shuts things down and that

916
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:13,460
kind of,
like you were saying,

917
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,750
twisting in,
curling in and,

918
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,990
and darkening and,
and things are,

919
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,080
are all things that when you're
journeying,

920
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,470
you see them manifest literally in the
flow of your,

921
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,520
the theater of your imagination.
And so I think you really beautifully

922
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,010
described that.
Uh,

923
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,170
just in that I was totally there.

924
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,610
I think it's a disease of consciousness.
I think it's very similar to catching a

925
00:51:41,611 --> 00:51:43,440
cold that,
you know,

926
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,330
uh,
you don't see the cold,

927
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,370
you don't see a disease,
you don't see it,

928
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:50,970
but it affects you.
And I think there's an analogy to be

929
00:51:50,971 --> 00:51:55,470
made about diseases of consciousness
that you can get locked into these

930
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,340
terrible ways of looking at the world.
And I think that's one of the most

931
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:02,340
important things about what you're
trying to do in terms of building a

932
00:52:02,341 --> 00:52:05,610
community.
That if you can build a community and

933
00:52:05,611 --> 00:52:10,611
build a,
like a conscious ideology that that is

934
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:15,921
sort of a prescribed to people and
establish a very positive and loving

935
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:20,580
environment.
You can spread that.

936
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,160
Like you can spread a disease,
you know,

937
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:28,050
or for no better word,
a lot of seeds of love or whatever,

938
00:52:28,051 --> 00:52:30,780
whatever you would call it.
I mean you could do it the wrong way,

939
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,810
you know,
you could do it what the Nazis did and

940
00:52:33,811 --> 00:52:35,670
do what gang is Khan did and do it.

941
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,690
Some horrible people throughout history
have done similar things and a lot of

942
00:52:39,691 --> 00:52:42,750
ways because there are diseases of
ideas.

943
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:47,430
They're diseases of consciousness or you
could do it the right way or a good way

944
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:51,810
or a beneficial way or positive way.
And it seems like throughout history we

945
00:52:51,811 --> 00:52:56,811
almost have to see those negative ones
to learn the consequences of,

946
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,380
of letting these things happen.
I mean,

947
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:04,680
it's one of the reasons why Germany
won't let in the scientologists that

948
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,280
like,
Hey,

949
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,370
we've seen what happens when cults
takeover,

950
00:53:08,371 --> 00:53:10,920
okay,
we've got a deep history with fucked up

951
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,310
group thinking,
so let's just not let you guys in.

952
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,280
And it's what we were talking about
before the podcast.

953
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,120
We were talking about trump and what's
going on in this country right now.

954
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,420
And I was saying that I think it's
probably a good idea to have this moment

955
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:28,350
where we realized like,
oh,

956
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:30,840
we really have to pay attention.
Like we,

957
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:34,560
we can't just sit back and not
participate anymore because liquids

958
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:39,561
happened when it's a mockery.
The hold system is like been exposed by

959
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:44,220
this one guy as being a joke.
And it's always been a joke.

960
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,230
It's just been a joke that we've
accepted,

961
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,480
you know,
and we were talking about Hillary and

962
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:50,890
all the criminal investigations that
she's under.

963
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:54,810
And that somehow or another,
this one person who we know is insincere

964
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:58,860
is a better option than this other
person who we know is a jerk off.

965
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,130
Like,
what?

966
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,450
Where's the right?
And where's the.

967
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,100
I don't barely been an election where
that isn't true.

968
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:07,070
I thought Obama was a pretty clear
choice and there was a lot of

969
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:10,310
celebrating afterwards.
But of course then he disappointed

970
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:14,210
people like he's predicted he would at
his inauguration.

971
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:16,640
He said,
I'm not going to make everybody happy

972
00:54:16,641 --> 00:54:18,440
and you're not going to always be happy
with me.

973
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:19,360
He,
he,

974
00:54:19,361 --> 00:54:21,950
he predicted that and he came through
with that.

975
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,650
But I remember all the elections of my
life.

976
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:26,900
It was like,
you know,

977
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:31,020
I mean,
I always voted for the least worst

978
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,360
person.
You know what I mean?

979
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:33,830
I mean,
I think Al Gore was,

980
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,940
was,
was up there.

981
00:54:34,941 --> 00:54:36,470
He was really good and I,
you know,

982
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:41,471
and I actually won and he actually won
where the,

983
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,840
uh,
the coup took place.

984
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:45,220
Right.

985
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,160
There were corporate America took over.
Yeah,

986
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,380
it really did.
I mean that's.

987
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:51,700
Well,
it's also where the system that we're

988
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:55,990
voting under is exposed.
They're still using pieces of paper.

989
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:57,020
And then also the,
the.

990
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:02,130
Did you ever see hacking democracy,
the Hbo Hbo Documentary on the Diebold

991
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:02,630
Systems?

992
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,450
Oh my God.
I'm.

993
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,280
So,
his brother was a vice president there,

994
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,120
work there,
there before

995
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,243
they,
uh,

996
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,980
before they were making voting machines.
Whoa.

997
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,840
Yeah.
They actually changed their name after

998
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:19,860
that documentary.
Is that they establish a voting machine

999
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:23,010
where you can,
I recommend everybody watch hacking

1000
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:24,450
democracy.
I think it was from,

1001
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,540
I want to say 2007 or something like
that.

1002
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,880
Yeah.
But it was a documentary where they

1003
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:34,140
exposed that these voting machines,
not only can they be manipulated,

1004
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:38,700
they were designed to be manipulated,
they were designed to have a third party

1005
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,720
entrance,
like a third party could enter in data

1006
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,140
and it's just madness that those
machines are how our election got

1007
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:54,060
decided and you know,
they've since then cleaned it up and in

1008
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:55,980
some way,
but still it's a dirty system.

1009
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,760
Doesn't it seem like we could actually
have some encryption that each voter

1010
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,930
could vote online?
Exactly.

1011
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,290
And do it in a minute.
Sure.

1012
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,390
And uh,
and we'd know.

1013
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,580
Here's a perfect example.
Banking.

1014
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,750
Everyone.
Banks online who,

1015
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,320
who doesn't bank online who doesn't buy
things online,

1016
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,270
trade credit card transactions with
people like,

1017
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:19,290
Whoa,
we gets hacked.

1018
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,210
How often?
How often?

1019
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,380
How many people,
how?

1020
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:25,360
Okay.
What percentage of it is it enough to

1021
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:27,160
shift an election?
I would say it's probably not.

1022
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,090
I would say it's not.
I would say if you could make banking

1023
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,750
secure,
you can make voting secure phone.

1024
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:36,610
They couldn't even get into that guy's
phone.

1025
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:37,010
You know,
they,

1026
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,300
you can do this and so they should do
it.

1027
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,110
Well.
Representative government is not

1028
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:43,540
necessary anymore.
We can communicate instantaneously with

1029
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:46,360
people all throughout the world.
We're not talking about sending a raven,

1030
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:49,660
you know,
this isn't the 13 hundreds.

1031
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,210
This is.
This is an interesting time and we're

1032
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:55,180
not taking advantage of the resources
that are available to us,

1033
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,150
but as far as representing the actual
people,

1034
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:01,210
but I think there's also a problem with
that too is there's a lot of people that

1035
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:04,090
are just completely uneducated,
uninterested,

1036
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,000
Slovenly,
lazy people and we have to energize

1037
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:07,780
those people.

1038
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:11,950
We have to reinvigorate their ideas of
participation.

1039
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,050
Enough community and you have to say
like,

1040
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:16,150
look,
you can't just sit on your couch and eat

1041
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:18,520
twinkies and watch beverly hills
housewives.

1042
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:20,980
You can't do that anymore because if you
do,

1043
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,100
you're not allowed to complain about the
world being fucked up because you're a

1044
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:29,101
part of the world being fucked up and I
think in two weeks weaken energize

1045
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:34,150
people until we can give people the
sense that they actually can participate

1046
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:37,870
in and it is just a bunch of human
beings that are trying to figure out the

1047
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,900
right and the wrong way to do things.
I think there's a lot of that going on

1048
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:43,390
right now.
I think there's this ebb and flow of

1049
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:47,890
social media and positive aspects of it
and negative aspects of it,

1050
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:51,910
but ultimately I think a lot of that is
just us learning to navigate the

1051
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:52,570
landscape.

1052
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:56,440
This new landscape is digital,
interconnected landscape that's

1053
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:59,050
unprecedented in human history.
We don't.

1054
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:01,330
I don't think we can understand it
because we're a part of it.

1055
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,010
I mean,
I think we can sort of.

1056
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:04,240
We're talking about it,
right,

1057
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,860
but I don't think if we look back in
history and they a thousand years from

1058
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:09,940
now,
look at this day,

1059
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,190
the way we're looking at Michelangelo or
Leonardo Da Vinci or gang,

1060
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:16,570
this con or anyone,
you look back and you go,

1061
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:18,250
wow,
what a crazy time.

1062
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:22,720
That's nothing compared to today.
Today is the craziest time ever.

1063
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,000
The emergence of artificial
intelligence,

1064
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:29,950
the emergence of a very bizarre method
of communication where you can

1065
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:34,951
instantaneously reach people on the
entire planet where data is shared like

1066
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:39,160
that.
Well amongst hundreds of millions of

1067
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,520
people instantly.
It's a new world.

1068
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,850
It's a fucking crazy new world.
It's a birth.

1069
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,780
It is literally like a birth,
it's like an organism coming out of an

1070
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:54,280
egg and poking his head out and right
now the shells being chipped and the

1071
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,740
heads popping up,
but this fucking thing's going to merge

1072
00:58:56,741 --> 00:59:01,690
and it's gonna fly will turn.
Dr Dan talked about the noosphere,

1073
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:05,470
you know,
about the thinking layer of the earth,

1074
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,250
you know,
and that's really what enabled,

1075
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,930
I mean,
you talked about it in the mid,

1076
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,180
Mid 20th century and uh,
so this thinking layer,

1077
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,840
a thinking atmosphere that's around the
earth now through satellites,

1078
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:22,190
through

1079
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,340
all of the,
uh,

1080
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,530
interactive technology that we're
currently speaking on,

1081
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:32,990
you know,
is a new body for the soul of humanity.

1082
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,140
You know,
this is now,

1083
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,000
uh,
what we're,

1084
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,820
what we're working on now is the theo
sphere.

1085
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:45,560
That's what we've got to tap and access.
Now.

1086
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,740
We have a connectedness with each other
now as a symbol that shouldn't really

1087
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:57,910
clue us into something important.
If we look at other nature systems like

1088
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:03,410
the,
my celio intelligence weaves the woods

1089
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:08,000
together and that we have our entire
soil and makes it alive.

1090
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,950
Really,
uh,

1091
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,160
these are spores a connected by fibers.
And that's what we are.

1092
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,110
Well,
if you can explain what what's going on

1093
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:20,210
in the Pacific northwest in regards to
that,

1094
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:25,390
like how enormous the actual individual
organism of my sealy connection is.

1095
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:29,750
And the Pacific northwest.
It's essentially like someone described

1096
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,870
it.
I might've been Mckenna as like a

1097
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,720
thousand gray whales.
That's how big this organism is.

1098
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:39,110
And it's essentially one interconnected
mushroom.

1099
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,060
Like,
whoa.

1100
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,170
Yeah.
The biggest thing on earth being on

1101
01:00:45,171 --> 01:00:46,730
earth is a mushroom.
Exactly.

1102
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:49,040
Well,
it's the oldest being as well.

1103
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,370
You know,
we're more like mushrooms than any other

1104
01:00:52,371 --> 01:00:53,450
plant.
Yes,

1105
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,011
yes.
They,

1106
01:00:54,011 --> 01:00:58,160
they actually breathe in oxygen and
breathe out carbon dioxide like people.

1107
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,330
You know,
I've been incredibly fascinated over the

1108
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:06,080
last few months with plant intelligence
and with plant communication and

1109
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:11,081
calculations and this idea that plants
have some sort of a consciousness.

1110
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,900
And one of the things that I've been
tripping out about is acacia trees,

1111
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:20,140
where if an animal eats them and the
wind carries the scent of the Acacia

1112
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:27,280
tree being consumed,
the bushes and trees downwind smell it

1113
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:31,850
and become bitter so that it discourages
predation.

1114
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:36,350
And animals were starving.
The downwind animals were starving

1115
01:01:36,351 --> 01:01:40,760
because they wouldn't eat the bushes
from the trees that had taken the scent

1116
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:42,620
of the trees that were up north.
I mean,

1117
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:47,621
it's madness and they were literally
sending out a signal to the other

1118
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:48,591
plants,
hey,

1119
01:01:48,591 --> 01:01:50,540
hit the alarm.
We're getting eaten.

1120
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,150
And they're communicating with each
other.

1121
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,350
Absolutely.
It's the underground and overground a

1122
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:01,380
network of plant intelligence.
So I think of basically the festival

1123
01:02:02,861 --> 01:02:07,720
culture as being mushrooms that are
growing out of the underground

1124
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:12,820
intelligence graves and stuff like that.
Those are the little fruiting bodies.

1125
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:18,060
Coachella though right now.
I don't know what kind of a is southwest

1126
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,060
man.
Bernie man this summer.

1127
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:27,430
I just want to tell everybody out there.
Come and be part of the Dr Bronner Foam

1128
01:02:27,431 --> 01:02:32,431
Dome Camp and get yourself sprayed with
foam and see us do paint our mural.

1129
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:36,750
So Dr. Bronner's soap.
So we're going to be in the maps.

1130
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:39,840
Brawner camp.
The maps is the multidisciplinary

1131
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:44,250
association for Psychedelic Studies.
Many of us know and they have the Zendo

1132
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:47,640
where people go when they need some help
and then there's also a.

1133
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,170
wait a minute.
What's that mean though?

1134
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,360
That's where,
you know the rangers,

1135
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:53,600
when they go around and they find people
who are triple,

1136
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:56,670
I'm having a bad time.
They go to the Zendo and they take care

1137
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:57,171
of them.
They're,

1138
01:02:57,171 --> 01:03:00,060
they're,
they're helped the Zendo.

1139
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,910
Oh yeah.
We,

1140
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,090
we have a Zendo at cosmo.
It's,

1141
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:07,960
well,
it's a place for meditating and chill

1142
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:12,961
out to get away from the frenetic energy
and just have a place of peace

1143
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,150
from that smells like feet.

1144
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,710
It's really beautiful and it sounds
strange,

1145
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:26,370
but it's made out of wood and bamboo and
cardboard.

1146
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,580
So how do they construct that out in the
middle of the bringing in pieces and

1147
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,180
ended up like they do everything else
there.

1148
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:34,830
Wow.
How long does it take to put that

1149
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:36,660
together?
People come over like a week or two

1150
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:39,450
ahead of time depending on how complex
you could put together.

1151
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:44,620
But we did a dome in 2006 with maps and
I'm Matt Atwood who did the

1152
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:50,580
infrastructure and uh,
it was called the n theone village and

1153
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:51,960
it was deadly [inaudible] village for
years.

1154
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:55,060
Alex named it.
So now we have empty on growing and

1155
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,700
causing.
But it used to be,

1156
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,480
uh,
at,

1157
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,800
at burning man.
But anyway,

1158
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,420
it's.
Did you go?

1159
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,510
No,
I don't go be around that many hippies.

1160
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,880
It's all kinds of people.
But it is the freest place on earth.

1161
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:12,090
Certainly infested with hippies though.
Let's be honest with ourselves.

1162
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,420
Well now the people who are using
Sacramento I to take objection for a

1163
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:21,420
moment and speak for the hippies
because.

1164
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:26,280
Because I think that this is like one of
the last places where it's okay,

1165
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,160
you know,
like it's no longer okay to say nigger

1166
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:30,320
or queer.
Okay.

1167
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:35,190
Got or you know,
to have that,

1168
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,770
you know.
So if you're a Hippie,

1169
01:04:37,771 --> 01:04:41,500
maybe you could call another hippy,
a dirty hippy kind of a hippie.

1170
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:50,360
I'm essentially a weird version of a
hippie.

1171
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,900
I don't fit into the mold because I'm
also a cage fighting commentator.

1172
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,690
The diversity and,
and you know,

1173
01:04:57,691 --> 01:05:02,691
the burning man used to have the genital
portraits studio and the portrait

1174
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:07,280
studio.
Will you punderdome you would love was

1175
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:08,700
like,
I should know.

1176
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:13,970
Fuck man.
Range guns.

1177
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,040
You should.
They have open bars

1178
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,100
there and they're giving it all away.
The thing about burning man is it's a

1179
01:05:21,101 --> 01:05:24,220
gift economy,
so it's an experiment in gift economy.

1180
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,480
You not once you get in and it caused
something to get in of course,

1181
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:31,000
but once you get in it's like you don't
take your wallet out,

1182
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:33,310
you can't pay for anything and there's
no bartering.

1183
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:35,950
It's only gifting and people give it
away.

1184
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,720
Yeah,
there's the thunder.

1185
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:42,070
They're like nerf sticks.
It don't really hurt each other,

1186
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,110
but they.
But they knocked them to try to knock

1187
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:48,940
them off of their perch there.
Although they're swinging on those ropes

1188
01:05:48,941 --> 01:05:50,710
in that dome.
It's a dome frame.

1189
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,540
Anyway,
there's all kinds.

1190
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,790
There's 80,000 people there.
It's the best,

1191
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:58,120
biggest,
most amazing environment.

1192
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,600
It's like being on the moon.
It's like not like being nowhere else on

1193
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:04,050
earth.
You have to always carry your ma,

1194
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:08,400
your dust mask and your goggles and your
hair covering and your camelback.

1195
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:13,480
It's so drawing that you have to be
drinking like a couple of gallons a day,

1196
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:14,350
you know,
just to,

1197
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,840
you know,
there's no insects there.

1198
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:20,050
There is not a blade of any kind of life
there.

1199
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,430
It's like walking on the moon seriously,
except you can breathe,

1200
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:28,630
but you have to have a face man because
the dust storms just come up at any

1201
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,700
moment.
It's anyone done a documentary on it

1202
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,280
many,
many over the years.

1203
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,350
So when you're there,
there's dudes taking cameras in your

1204
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:36,360
face.
Isn't that sort of.

1205
01:06:36,361 --> 01:06:39,970
Do you have to have permission?
Everything is very regulated now and I

1206
01:06:39,971 --> 01:06:43,590
understand they're behind,
so I'm hoping they'll have some good

1207
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,960
because they'd been.
Yeah.

1208
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:48,250
That was an infrastructure where you
said that like somebody offered you a a

1209
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:52,780
beautiful cake and buying land.
Land is good for our community.

1210
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:57,781
We should own our own places of of
attraction because that is the way you

1211
01:06:59,771 --> 01:07:04,540
gain transformational power,
power to transform.

1212
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:09,540
You basically have land in place and you
build that infrastructure,

1213
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:13,990
this culture,
the way it's structured.

1214
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:15,760
Isn't that beautiful?
It's really cool.

1215
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,050
It really is beautiful.
The center part is called the Playa and

1216
01:07:20,051 --> 01:07:22,930
it's about nine feet across from from
end to end.

1217
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:26,030
Like big circle,
the biggest nine miles,

1218
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,213
feet,
nine feet,

1219
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,160
nine miles across,
and you can walk the whole way.

1220
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:32,620
A lot of people have art cars,
miles,

1221
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,600
well from,
from edge to edge,

1222
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,070
that's incredible.
Outer Edge.

1223
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:39,650
It's managing people.
It's good.

1224
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:45,150
Sixty to 80 and it's payable and
everybody takes care of each other.

1225
01:07:45,581 --> 01:07:46,950
You have to have your own food.
You can't.

1226
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,380
You got to come in there with water,
food and everything and you're not

1227
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:53,980
allowed to pull her or drop anything on
the ground.

1228
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:57,400
If you,
if you have and they have full showers.

1229
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,770
Broader camp is,
you know,

1230
01:07:58,780 --> 01:07:59,440
you get foam.

1231
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,930
Do you know they have a big foam dome
so.

1232
01:08:01,931 --> 01:08:06,610
But you got to collect all that water
and they collect them in these great big

1233
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:10,780
gray water tankers and take them away
and bring in fresh water.

1234
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:14,570
It's like they're practicing setting up
a village in,

1235
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:18,530
in light of the apocalypse.
I'm telling you this is the practice

1236
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:19,910
ready?
Yeah.

1237
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:22,150
These people can go in and in a week or
two.

1238
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,490
I mean the government,
I mean the army went in there to study

1239
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:28,100
this because they could do this in a
couple of weeks.

1240
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:32,450
They put it all together.
So it's very much apocalyptic

1241
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:33,740
preparation.
You know,

1242
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:38,760
you would think you would get great
benefit from seeing it and get material

1243
01:08:39,131 --> 01:08:42,650
out of it.
You should come be with our camp,

1244
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,530
you know it,
the,

1245
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:49,100
it is the week that leads to Labor Day
weekend.

1246
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:54,140
So that's like the first weekend of this
is the first Monday of the first Monday

1247
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:55,280
of September is Labor.

1248
01:08:55,790 --> 01:09:00,790
So it's the weekend before the Monday of
Labor Day and they have the temple burn

1249
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:06,340
is on Saturday night and Sunday night
and the man is burned on Saturday night.

1250
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:09,080
So when the man is burned,
you know,

1251
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:10,580
100,
800,000,

1252
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:15,020
80,000 people come together to see it.
It's like everybody comes in a big

1253
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:17,360
circle around the man.
Where's the man?

1254
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,060
There he is.
I think it'd be like you're gonna get

1255
01:09:19,061 --> 01:09:20,090
the fuck out.
And you know what?

1256
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:23,990
They have a thousand fire spinners
around the man.

1257
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:27,100
You have to.
You have to audition to be a fire spin

1258
01:09:27,101 --> 01:09:29,180
around the man,
but they have about a thousand of them

1259
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:32,330
and they're spinning whips.
My friend Joe,

1260
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:37,331
they're spinning swords and poor boy and
and all kinds of Hula hoops are are on

1261
01:09:39,111 --> 01:09:42,020
fire.
It's the most amazing thing and you go

1262
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:44,870
there on your art car,
you're not allowed to go in,

1263
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,860
apply at all unless your car is approved
as an art car.

1264
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:51,380
That means it has to be show some art
cars.

1265
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:55,880
Our cars are incredible.
They've got big ships like rolling along

1266
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:58,250
the Playa,
you know they have gigantic three

1267
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:02,930
stories.
Structures that move to kind of be

1268
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:07,220
enhancing the environment they do and
they have to be all they have to be art.

1269
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:12,250
And the reason why they even do them at
all in one big way is so that you can

1270
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:16,220
get on the top of them so that you can
see over everybody else.

1271
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:19,940
When you go to see the man and you can
see all these fire spinners that are all

1272
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:22,040
around this.
You want to be up high,

1273
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,590
so you're part of dinosaur,
your party,

1274
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:27,830
your parties up there.
It's all you got your own Dj.

1275
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,760
Seriously,
this,

1276
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:32,930
this car,
it's got its own Dj mine where Alex

1277
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:36,050
painted it and we're going to be on the
Mayan Warrior this year.

1278
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,440
Check out the line.
How does that work?

1279
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:44,120
People pay year round to park these
things in,

1280
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,650
in girl latch.
You know an outsider is the non town.

1281
01:10:48,651 --> 01:10:50,890
It's like this town that grew up around
Bernie man.

1282
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,880
They have like one store,
you know,

1283
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,760
it's like you drive into this moon like
planet.

1284
01:10:56,190 --> 01:11:00,050
This,
this place is where wallboard is made.

1285
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:02,810
Okay?
So if you peeled off the paper,

1286
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:06,530
that's what the Playa is like in.
It's like a skin.

1287
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:10,850
You're not allowed to drop peanut shells
or anything on the ground and you have

1288
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:12,920
to collect everything.
So it's extremely.

1289
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,040
And

1290
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,020
you,
you learn about saving water,

1291
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,540
you can't believe how much you try to,
you know,

1292
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,270
save water,
love the mine.

1293
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:22,830
That's beautiful,
isn't it?

1294
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:25,320
You?
What did you use to eliminate it with

1295
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,060
all the painting is our.
We'll just click,

1296
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,010
click on one,
stuck on it,

1297
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:31,900
stop flipping around.
Just go to that show.

1298
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,920
The mask painting area that me on all
over the course,

1299
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:38,730
you know,
how do you power that thing?

1300
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:41,410
They do it.
Jay do it.

1301
01:11:41,411 --> 01:11:43,620
They all do it.
They all have to have light on it.

1302
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,390
You can't even have a bicycle on the
plier without leds.

1303
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,610
But what is what is illuminating this,
I mean this is for people,

1304
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:56,520
for people listening alone.
This thing is filled with beautiful

1305
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:01,580
lights and this,
the flower of life is in one of them.

1306
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,770
And what are the other ones?
The blue ones above the flower of life.

1307
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:06,350
There's more flower,
the flower of life.

1308
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,680
But also notice that there's a second
story and if you scroll down a little

1309
01:12:10,681 --> 01:12:12,330
bit,
you'll see there's a third story.

1310
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:14,310
See those people up there.
That's loyalty.

1311
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:16,950
Those are the DJ's and the royalty
royalty.

1312
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,950
I'm just joking,
but really it's like,

1313
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,050
you know the people who own the Mayan
warrior up there and they're best

1314
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:22,960
friends.
Oh,

1315
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,540
I thought it was your friends.
Oh No,

1316
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:24,941
no,
no.

1317
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,700
It's painted it.
It was a commission.

1318
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:33,240
This.
They brought it from Mexico City on its

1319
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,110
own trailer.
They drove it from Mexico City to cause

1320
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:38,730
them.
I would've thought that it was a Trojan

1321
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:42,170
horse field
border.

1322
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:45,500
The border patrol have everybody out.
Well,

1323
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,010
was all enclosed in this trail.
I was enclosed to the.

1324
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,540
Definitely
don't worry.

1325
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:53,730
We looked.
There's no Mexicans in here sneaking

1326
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:57,300
across the border and will ask for your
Trojan horse.

1327
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:02,450
Alex's collectors are probably
the most well meaning,

1328
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:05,550
you know,
they have the most means of all Mexicans

1329
01:13:05,551 --> 01:13:07,890
I would say.
What are those stacks?

1330
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,410
The stack things is two stacks.
Yeah,

1331
01:13:10,411 --> 01:13:12,240
it looks like Sydney blogs.
Those are speakers.

1332
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,050
Disco,
you're all going to go deaf.

1333
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,130
You bring your own Dj baby.
What if the music's annoying?

1334
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,700
What kind of music are you playing?
Only cool shit.

1335
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:29,530
We to see these are people that produce
our events in Mexico City and they

1336
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:32,100
sponsor us going down there and doing
it,

1337
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:33,990
you know,
like for events for a visit.

1338
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:37,010
And we've done it a few times.
So they'll do a workshop,

1339
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,390
they'll do a day lecture,
you know,

1340
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:42,600
they'll do a and then they'll do an
evening event and given any event it's

1341
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:44,670
an electronic dance music party at a
big,

1342
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,180
a big place,
you know,

1343
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:50,550
and we're on stage painting.
So these are producers that they produce

1344
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,710
for bigger names than us.
I mean way bigger,

1345
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:56,730
but we do our thing down there and so
we've got a bunch of bikes behind it as

1346
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:57,520
well as that.
With that is.

1347
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,050
Or is that people parking their bikes,
you know,

1348
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,100
they come up,
they hey,

1349
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:07,101
can we come up and have a ride
to though you to have one of these?

1350
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,710
Some people have motor.
Well you have to have a.

1351
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,710
well I don't know.
We'll find out there though.

1352
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:17,080
Don't they give you ear beatings?
Don't they find you?

1353
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:18,670
And then go.
How's

1354
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,490
your hair covered?
Hiding.

1355
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:26,400
Completely
Open.

1356
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:28,830
Why do you want to have?
Well we go in and we,

1357
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:30,610
we,
we paint our mural.

1358
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:35,670
That's when we see our station.
You can always come and find us at the

1359
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:40,681
foam dome at our 32 foot mural that will
be painting the wandering around with a

1360
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:45,350
gas mask on and goggles and head dress
in the middle of a gypsum forest.

1361
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,970
Sounds so ridiculous.
This guy,

1362
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:56,170
for sure.
Some of these people are extremely

1363
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:57,210
wealthy.
Looking broader.

1364
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:59,820
These people.
This is the,

1365
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:03,490
I would say the highest festival I've
ever been to.

1366
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:05,280
That guy's definitely broke.
Guaranteed.

1367
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:12,420
You must be saved up all year.
Now he's met that guy.

1368
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,640
It looks like the alien that they found
when the movie alien.

1369
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:20,670
The guy that's a guy from Google comes
to this guy from Google.

1370
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:26,930
The children of the inventors.
You sound like a spokesperson for now.

1371
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,940
We're either.
We've only been.

1372
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:32,080
This will be our fifth time.
She.

1373
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,840
Let me go back to that one.
The girl has got that blue one above

1374
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:36,160
there.
The blue light one.

1375
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,960
That seems like some industrial
strength.

1376
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:42,280
Gas Mask type shit.
Seems like particle mask.

1377
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:46,030
What about dust?
You have to have goggles.

1378
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:51,490
I sent sense your enthusiasm.
I appreciate it,

1379
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:56,491
but fuck that place.
When I was 14,

1380
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:01,540
it was the first time we went.
We were invited.

1381
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:04,810
Every time we've gone,
somebody who's brought us our daughters,

1382
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:10,180
our daughter,
when she was 14 and we were there,

1383
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:15,480
will smith goes to burning man.
A lot of freaks should use it like a

1384
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,950
mecca.
You go watch.

1385
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:23,010
It's a higher.
If you're a freak show every year,

1386
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:27,160
five times.
Seems like this is a great idea in a

1387
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:30,040
shitty spot and this can be recreated
somewhere habitable.

1388
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:32,030
How about that?
Perfect.

1389
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,690
In so many barriers.
The reason these are,

1390
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:40,840
it's an art festival.
They make a sculpture it and they put it

1391
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:44,140
on the bare ground.
It's like going into a white gallery,

1392
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,020
you know,
it's like going into like a white out

1393
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:51,400
and then you put an object there and
frankly you've got a lot of space around

1394
01:16:51,401 --> 01:16:54,610
it so you can really look at any man's
sculpture,

1395
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,380
sculpture.

1396
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:01,380
It's about seeing the art,
so it's not for everybody.

1397
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,800
I think that it's an extraordinary,
a outgrowth of visionary culture.

1398
01:17:10,431 --> 01:17:13,730
I'm totally joking around obviously when
I'm mocking it,

1399
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,760
but that's my nature.
This fire fire before know we.

1400
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,040
We were.
We have a sculpture at cars and that was

1401
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:26,390
on the plier to two stories sculpture at
at and we're getting another one.

1402
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:30,560
People with them afterwards,
they went someplace to put them.

1403
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:31,940
Will cause them.
Has 40 acres,

1404
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:35,660
so we're gonna end up with probably more
so they're going to ship burning man

1405
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:36,950
sculptures.
We do that.

1406
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,360
Oh,
you going to ship it to us?

1407
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,180
We pay for it.
That's amazing.

1408
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:44,600
That and it that.
That's incredible.

1409
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,000
And you go out there and you just visit
all these sculptures.

1410
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:50,420
It's nine miles of sculpture.
You just go ride your bike from

1411
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:52,070
sculpture to sculpture.
Many of them,

1412
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:55,310
most of them are interactive so you can
go inside of them.

1413
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,430
You can climb up in them.
They sometimes they have swings and a

1414
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:01,300
lot of them have fire coming out.
That's incredible because you can.

1415
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,890
You can light things on fire there.
That's what makes it so exciting to us.

1416
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,880
This is the Belgium,
the Belgian waffles,

1417
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,060
Kate,
Kate,

1418
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:12,580
Kate Rod,
which sculptured cause what?

1419
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,850
Cade Rod,
but she does a laser cut cold rolled

1420
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:20,570
steel sculptures that are,
that are interacting with their pods.

1421
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,740
You sit in them,
they're real comfy there.

1422
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,560
Oh,
this is amazing.

1423
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,720
We're looking at,
for people that are listening,

1424
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:27,890
we're looking at Mars.
One,

1425
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:29,150
look at verse one,
sculpture.

1426
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:34,040
For people that are listening,
we're looking at this geometric object

1427
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:37,790
that's circular,
but it's got squared edges.

1428
01:18:37,791 --> 01:18:39,290
What would you call that?
What does that,

1429
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,560
what does that a sacred geometric form.
And these guys are.

1430
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,430
They're from San Francisco.
We know these guys.

1431
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,420
Um,
and this,

1432
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,420
whatever this geometric form is,
what's making my chandelier?

1433
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,260
This?
Yes,

1434
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:01,060
they're making my chandelier's for,
for Ian.

1435
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,640
I'm going to have chandelier's,
uh,

1436
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,910
that were light where they turn and the
light falls on people.

1437
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,540
It's environmental.
It's called Jamie a fest.

1438
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:14,630
Three hundred a sneak peek at the
coolest art coming to burning man.

1439
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,400
So you could see this,
uh,

1440
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,050
online.
If you go google it,

1441
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:23,480
it's really stunning.
This image.

1442
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:26,000
Okay.
So there's a magazine that has a bunch

1443
01:19:26,001 --> 01:19:27,350
of these images.
Oh God,

1444
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:29,270
that's amazing.
That's cool.

1445
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,650
Almost worth going.
Yeah.

1446
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:36,650
Maybe if you bring a big tour bus,
bring an Rv,

1447
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:37,940
you little.
You don't want to come,

1448
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,833
Joe,
if that.

1449
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,850
You want to come with him.
Are you

1450
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:43,960
kidding?
No,

1451
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,910
we don't care.
How long does it take to get out there?

1452
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,220
Where is it?
Let's see.

1453
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,140
Tens of thousands of people do come
from.

1454
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:54,050
Where is it?
It's a black rock city out in about an

1455
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:55,810
hour from Reno,
Nevada.

1456
01:19:57,690 --> 01:19:59,570
It's probably got a lot of nuclear
energy out there,

1457
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,820
right?
I will do those tests you ever see that?

1458
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,700
Um,
the animated Gif.

1459
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:08,100
It's like a little movie of all the
nuclear tests

1460
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:13,100
that they've done in Nevada
might explain a lot about what's going

1461
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:15,440
on out there.
I've done hundreds of them just to,

1462
01:20:15,441 --> 01:20:19,530
to digital digital.
They did this thing from like 1940,

1463
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:22,980
whatever it was the time when they
detonated the first atomic bomb to

1464
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:28,070
present at the bottom of a see that once
was made of crushed shell and you know,

1465
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:33,270
it feels like sand,
but if you walk on it,

1466
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,600
he won't be able to use your feet in the
middle of the winter.

1467
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,700
That's what I'm saying is if you're out
of your feet,

1468
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,000
you won't be able to use your feet in
the middle of the winter.

1469
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:47,010
Tracking the cracking.
Even in the middle of winter.

1470
01:20:47,011 --> 01:20:49,250
I did it once.
I'm just telling you it,

1471
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:49,890
it,
it,

1472
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:52,980
it.
I had to walk back from the man to our

1473
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:57,930
camp without any shoes because I lost my
shoes and I walked back through and it

1474
01:20:57,931 --> 01:21:02,931
feels like sand at first,
but then it's like knives.

1475
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:05,340
He likes little tiny little knives.
They're like shells.

1476
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:07,710
It's like crushed,
crushed shells and it messed up your

1477
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:10,650
feet and all winter I was dealing with
cracked feet,

1478
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:15,150
happy feet burning.
See you have to wear boots and really

1479
01:21:15,151 --> 01:21:20,151
cover and it gets to be like 110 degrees
in the day and 40 degrees at night.

1480
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:25,180
Sounds like you're trying to keep me off
trying to keep me off the thing.

1481
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:30,260
We're building a place at caution that
is going to how some of the sculptures

1482
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:36,021
and have little sculptural areas,
so we have these small gatherings by

1483
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,290
comparison to that.
They'll never be huge like that though,

1484
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:45,390
but hundreds of people will gather so it
can still feel kind of tribal and

1485
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:49,650
community oriented,
but a lot of the same music is enjoyed.

1486
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,620
We always have fire circle and we always
have fire spinning.

1487
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:55,720
We actually teach fire spinning it cause
of getting,

1488
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,690
not of hand like fire.

1489
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:02,160
All that fire spinning around there.
Those people are the most cautious.

1490
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,040
And we also have a relationship with the
fire department.

1491
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:08,280
They're in our town.
We have a sheriff on property,

1492
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,510
uh,
at the,

1493
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:14,760
at each event where there are large
numbers of people.

1494
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:16,250
And so we,
you know,

1495
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,380
safety first,
but there's ways of doing it.

1496
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:24,510
So when do you anticipate this entire
thing?

1497
01:22:24,511 --> 01:22:26,520
The entire cause of them.
We should tell everybody.

1498
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:30,240
That means chapel of sacred mirrors.
That's what caused them stands for.

1499
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:34,830
And when do you anticipate that being
fully operational and

1500
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:38,190
inaction?
Well,

1501
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:43,050
right now it is open.
We're open like four days a week so that

1502
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:46,860
people,
we have an ongoing stream of people who

1503
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:51,861
just are visitors and there are a small
art exhibits that are on display now.

1504
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,670
We're working on anthon.
That's where the grand exhibit will be

1505
01:22:56,671 --> 01:23:01,671
housed and they exhibit that we had on
display for five years in the city that

1506
01:23:02,161 --> 01:23:03,660
is not currently on display.

1507
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:07,300
The sacred marriage are not there,
but they will be in the new space.

1508
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:10,060
And so the new space,
as we said,

1509
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:15,160
we're thinking we'll open sometime in
2017 probably toward the end of the year

1510
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,130
and then,
uh,

1511
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,000
as,
as we can,

1512
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,170
we will build the outside of it,
you know,

1513
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:24,340
the sculpture,
it's just a matter of how many years

1514
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:27,660
it's gonna take.
It's gonna probably take a few years ago

1515
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:29,650
when the power go lotto.
Yeah.

1516
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:30,910
Yeah.
Then you were able to do.

1517
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:34,800
Donations can come in all these things.
We get donations.

1518
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:36,880
I think all these things can happen.
I mean,

1519
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:38,860
the kickstarter thing.
Look Joe,

1520
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:43,890
you were really helpful to us when the
last time we did the podcast,

1521
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:49,860
there was definitely a Rogan bump that
happened to the kickstarter that took us

1522
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,960
to a new level.
Say good news is that there's probably

1523
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:56,794
what,

1524
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,270
how many more million people listening
know,

1525
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,940
like how many years ago was it that you
guys came on last three years?

1526
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,010
So that was,
we're getting pilot 4 million downloads

1527
01:24:08,011 --> 01:24:09,650
a month,
probably tripled that night,

1528
01:24:09,651 --> 01:24:13,820
I'd say three years ago at least triple.
And then with the youtube.

1529
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,640
Youtube.
Yeah.

1530
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,870
So let's say we're in the neighborhood
of 30 million downloads a month.

1531
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,710
Joining us and being a temple builder,
joining us,

1532
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,960
um,
I think that there's going to be a lot

1533
01:24:30,961 --> 01:24:33,900
of people that are excited about it.
I think what the idea behind it is

1534
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:36,150
beautiful.
The idea that you guys are leaving it

1535
01:24:36,151 --> 01:24:37,940
for the community and building it for
the community.

1536
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:39,600
Beautiful.
And uh,

1537
01:24:39,601 --> 01:24:44,190
that's one of the best arguments for
religion that I've ever heard and best

1538
01:24:44,191 --> 01:24:47,580
arguments for having a religion be tax
exempt that I've ever heard.

1539
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:49,230
I mean,
you guys are literally doing it for

1540
01:24:49,231 --> 01:24:50,760
other people and you're doing it for
everybody.

1541
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:52,320
It's awesome.
And you know,

1542
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:55,260
your artwork is just a huge fan of what
you do.

1543
01:24:55,261 --> 01:24:58,710
And I just think that the design itself
is literally,

1544
01:24:58,711 --> 01:25:00,570
like I said,
probably the coolest building on the

1545
01:25:00,571 --> 01:25:02,260
planet and it's a real.
I mean,

1546
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:06,840
what you're doing is essentially an
extension of the great works of all

1547
01:25:06,841 --> 01:25:07,674
these,
you know,

1548
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,650
when you're talking about the sistine
chapel or if you're talking about the

1549
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:15,090
Egyptian pyramids or any of these sacred
sites that exist all throughout the

1550
01:25:15,091 --> 01:25:17,550
world.
You're doing a modern version of that

1551
01:25:17,551 --> 01:25:18,630
and it's,
it's amazing.

1552
01:25:18,631 --> 01:25:19,590
It's really,
really cool.

1553
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:25,350
50 greatest works I think will be on
view there in their original form,

1554
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:31,860
but the actual paintings that alex roped
with his own hand and some of them have

1555
01:25:31,861 --> 01:25:34,980
become really iconic to people.
There are a lot of people out there that

1556
01:25:34,981 --> 01:25:37,170
have Alex's posters and tee shirts.
Oh,

1557
01:25:37,171 --> 01:25:41,060
I have a bunch of plays and everything.
But to see the originals,

1558
01:25:41,061 --> 01:25:43,870
that's a study for other artists,
clay,

1559
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:47,850
the prints that a lot of people have,
the limited edition prints that they

1560
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:52,880
have of paintings that wonderful labor
intensive artists is made.

1561
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:57,030
I've never heard that word or that word,
limited edition prints that I've read

1562
01:25:57,031 --> 01:25:58,980
it.
I just thought that was like leaky or

1563
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,063
something.

1564
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,220
Well,
the other thing about anthem

1565
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:08,660
is that it's going to display the work
of the International Visionary Art

1566
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:09,940
Movement.
And uh,

1567
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:11,960
these are,
I mean,

1568
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,950
if you liked my stuff,
you should see some of the young people

1569
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:18,800
that are making art out of their
journeys.

1570
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:20,230
Now they're,
you know,

1571
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,250
they're evolving beyond,
you know,

1572
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:23,810
my work.
And uh,

1573
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:29,200
also I think they're building an
encyclopedia of these dimensions of

1574
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,640
altered states that people can say it
was something like that,

1575
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:39,860
but it's very specific in that if you go
back before the 19 sixties and you look

1576
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:42,260
at the art really didn't represent the
trips.

1577
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:43,490
It,
it just didn't.

1578
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:44,960
Um,
and you look at it now,

1579
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:49,990
there's a giant body of art that
represents these psychedelic trips that

1580
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:55,510
really didn't exist before.
So in a lot of ways it is a quiet new

1581
01:26:55,611 --> 01:27:00,350
chapter in the world of art that one day
I think people are gonna look back on.

1582
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:05,410
And once we realize the ridiculousness
of the prohibition on drugs,

1583
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:08,390
especially on psychedelic drugs,
nontoxic,

1584
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:12,290
non-problematic as far as like health
repercussions.

1585
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,800
And you wonder like what,
what was it about our restrictive

1586
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:20,510
society that put this sweeping
comprehensive ban on psychedelic

1587
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:23,210
substances in 1970 and what were the
ramifications?

1588
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:26,220
What was,
what were the consequences on society?

1589
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:31,290
So there was no organic,
there was no eco eco careers,

1590
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,260
there was,
there was no,

1591
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,380
you know,
save the planet,

1592
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,530
talk climate change.
We never heard about that.

1593
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,780
Growing up.
There was,

1594
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,800
there was people that were talking about
it and they were circling,

1595
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:46,400
certainly people that we're recycling
and composting and doing things along

1596
01:27:46,401 --> 01:27:50,150
those lines and trying to leave a
smaller footprint back then aware of it,

1597
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:55,300
but as far as a gigantic global
conscious movement and also the urgency

1598
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:59,510
that's attached to it today where people
are stepping back and they're looking at

1599
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:03,350
islands disappearing and you know,
they're looking at the rising sea levels

1600
01:28:03,351 --> 01:28:04,071
and they go,
well blah blah blah,

1601
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:04,370
blah,
blah.

1602
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:07,100
This is real.
This is actually happening inside of our

1603
01:28:07,101 --> 01:28:11,660
lifetime.
There's a lot going on that I think

1604
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:13,770
we're,
we're,

1605
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:17,720
we're in the middle of and I think this
visionary art that,

1606
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:20,450
that is going on right now,
we're sort of in the middle of that.

1607
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:23,690
I think as we look back on it,
or as people passed us,

1608
01:28:23,691 --> 01:28:25,130
look back on it,
they're going to say,

1609
01:28:25,131 --> 01:28:28,100
this is a very specific era.
This was an era.

1610
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:33,370
Like if you go back and look at
religious history and you look at the,

1611
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:36,040
um,
the enlightenment and you look at the

1612
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:41,000
various styles of art that's connected
to religion or cultural change,

1613
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,620
you know,
you see these big shifts.

1614
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:46,400
I think the visionary art of
Psychedelics is a big shift.

1615
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,790
It's huge.
Yeah.

1616
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:53,340
I think that it's the,
it's showing that the big news today is

1617
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,620
the Sacramento,
uh,

1618
01:28:57,770 --> 01:28:59,810
sort of reformation.

1619
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:03,990
You know,
that there's a return of the sacrament

1620
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:07,920
to the West.
It's been demonized and hidden for

1621
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:11,940
thousands of years.
Now it's back and you're not going to

1622
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:15,510
get rid of it.
Now it's here because we need it.

1623
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:20,610
There's nothing that's going to turn
consciousness around toward a sacred

1624
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:25,611
planet that wants to save itself from
self destruction like psychedelics.

1625
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,120
There is no greater prescription,
uh,

1626
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,590
for soul medicine.
Then this is the stuff that is curing

1627
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,580
all of the traumatic stress of,
of the vets,

1628
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:41,910
you know,
marijuana is part a,

1629
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:46,970
is leading the way in the medicinals and
opening the door literally for the

1630
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:50,310
sacred drugs,
the return of the sacred drugs.

1631
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:55,320
Now we don't even have a context a
established in America,

1632
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:57,160
but it's beginning,
you know,

1633
01:29:57,270 --> 01:30:00,570
the UDV church one,
their right to use the sacrament.

1634
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:06,020
The native American church has pod.
There is legal precedent for religious

1635
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:08,970
use already.

1636
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:14,810
The best there has been throughout
history except for the last couple

1637
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:15,950
thousand years.
Well in,

1638
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,070
uh,
in this country,

1639
01:30:17,071 --> 01:30:18,840
as you were talking about with Mtma,
I mean,

1640
01:30:18,841 --> 01:30:20,990
just a really the last few decades.
Yeah.

1641
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:25,770
And I'm five methoxy dimethyltryptamine
and I bought that stuff online,

1642
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:31,170
like in the 2001 or something like that.
You can just order it from some chemical

1643
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:33,180
company.
They sent you a bottle of it and get the

1644
01:30:33,181 --> 01:30:34,920
whole world hot.
I remember that.

1645
01:30:34,921 --> 01:30:36,450
Yeah,
it was great times it.

1646
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,170
Yes it was.
And uh,

1647
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:43,310
somehow we've got to find a way to
incorporate these sacraments.

1648
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,680
I think they're being incorporated.
And I think one of the things that you

1649
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:49,380
said that you just sort of glossed over,
but it's incredibly important is that

1650
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:51,470
marijuana is the door opener.
Yeah.

1651
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:54,810
Marijuana is the guy that you let into
the party that has the magic dust and

1652
01:30:54,811 --> 01:30:59,811
they went and he blew it on everybody
because once that gets in and especially

1653
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:04,260
edible marijuana,
edible marijuana is a psychedelic drug

1654
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,940
and many people don't know it.

1655
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,060
And that's one of the reasons why when
people eat brownies or something,

1656
01:31:09,061 --> 01:31:09,841
they'll say,
oh my God,

1657
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:11,760
someone laced the Brownie.
No,

1658
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:13,020
that's what it is.
That,

1659
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:16,020
that is the most potent form of
marijuana is the editable form of

1660
01:31:16,021 --> 01:31:19,110
marijuana.
And it is very visionary and especially

1661
01:31:19,111 --> 01:31:21,930
in high doses,
it's incredibly introspective acid,

1662
01:31:21,931 --> 01:31:24,170
like in a lot of ways you know,
you,

1663
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:29,190
you get a perspective that is life
changing and shifting and it's one of

1664
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:34,911
those directional shifts where even if
it's a small degree of change over the

1665
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:38,820
course of the rest of your life,
that small degree of change could equal

1666
01:31:38,821 --> 01:31:42,960
a very large shift in the direction that
you're going as you continue down your

1667
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:45,540
path.
That slight turn to the right will make

1668
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:48,420
a huge difference five years from now,
10 years from now,

1669
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:53,870
I think marijuana becoming legal in
Colorado and we are seeing not just the

1670
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:59,540
positive benefits in terms of the
community you're looking at that are

1671
01:32:00,311 --> 01:32:03,520
making way more money than they've ever
made before.

1672
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:07,390
You're looking at housing prices,
real estate prices going up.

1673
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:11,290
People having a new sense of community
where they like,

1674
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:12,640
oh,
there's others like us.

1675
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:17,260
It's like a magnet for freaks and
they've all flown into Colorado and set

1676
01:32:17,261 --> 01:32:19,060
up shop there.
It's fascinating.

1677
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:24,300
I did a show there a couple months ago
at the Belko theater and it was amazing.

1678
01:32:24,851 --> 01:32:27,340
It was like this place has changed in a
year.

1679
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:31,840
I recorded my last comedy special.
I'm about two years ago,

1680
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:36,010
two years in August in Colorado,
and then I did the most recent one about

1681
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:39,700
six months ago in Colorado.
The most recent show that I did there,

1682
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:43,210
and I could feel the shift when you
driving down the street,

1683
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:45,940
you see the difference.
There's pot everywhere.

1684
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:49,750
There's people are smiling.
The lowest incidence of drunk driving.

1685
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,320
They've ever recorded.
Lowest incidents of violent crime.

1686
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:57,110
Everything is dropping suicide rates.
Yes,

1687
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:58,210
and money.

1688
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:01,090
Money that the state is making isn't
insane.

1689
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,310
They literally,
you have a surplus of taxes.

1690
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:06,760
It's an attractor.
They've made more money from taxes from

1691
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:10,060
marijuana than they did from alcohol for
the first time ever.

1692
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:13,750
No one's ever done that,
and you've got this happy community and

1693
01:33:13,751 --> 01:33:17,140
now Seattle is entered into the mix.
Now Washington DC's enter into the

1694
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:19,500
Mexican November.
California's going to vote on it.

1695
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:22,360
I guarantee it's going to go through it.
Oh yes,

1696
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:26,290
of course it is.
Try to extend a little blessing New York

1697
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:26,921
way.
Okay.

1698
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:30,310
Because New York is so far behind.
I'm so ashamed of us.

1699
01:33:30,311 --> 01:33:33,490
Come on.
We got to move into action and our

1700
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:37,030
people little happen.
Just love it so much.

1701
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:41,890
I think that just the.
The ideologies that are were in place

1702
01:33:41,891 --> 01:33:44,010
that stopped it.
There roading.

1703
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,540
Those people are too old.
They're too out of touch.

1704
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:51,190
They don't understand the mindset of the
young people and they've really

1705
01:33:51,191 --> 01:33:53,710
underestimated the power of this
movement.

1706
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,710
They.
This is a wave and you can't suppress it

1707
01:33:56,711 --> 01:33:58,660
anymore.
You can't lose of people that are

1708
01:33:58,661 --> 01:34:00,210
upwardly spiraling.
Okay.

1709
01:34:00,211 --> 01:34:04,570
The people that are healthy,
all positive ecological,

1710
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:09,571
save the planet educated more thinking.
It's such an attractor and so everybody

1711
01:34:10,931 --> 01:34:12,480
wants to be part of.
They wonder what's.

1712
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:14,650
What is that?
We'll have a power.

1713
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,320
It's what we were talking about earlier
when we're talking about plant

1714
01:34:17,321 --> 01:34:20,410
intelligence,
there is an intelligence in marijuana

1715
01:34:20,411 --> 01:34:24,790
and absolute undoubted intelligence when
it exists.

1716
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:28,130
I think in all plants that exists in
funguses as not that

1717
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:33,290
not all plants are mirroring systems
inside of the human body like cannabis,

1718
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:40,320
since it was the probably the original
or one of the original culture

1719
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:45,150
cultivated plants.
I think that humanity over the millennia

1720
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:49,740
worked out a symbiotic relationship with
this plant and so we have the

1721
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:53,420
endocannabinoid system and then the,
uh,

1722
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:58,970
and I would say that probably many of
our health deficiencies are because

1723
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:04,210
we're not getting our cannabis thc
efficiencies and uh,

1724
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:05,140
no.
Well,

1725
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:10,140
let's try.
The Ama in the thirties went to Congress

1726
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:14,180
and said,
please don't make cannabis illegal.

1727
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:17,450
It's in half of our Madison,
you know,

1728
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:20,090
for 87 years.
It's been part of the American

1729
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:24,050
Pharmacopia.
Please allow us to continue to use it.

1730
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:27,530
No,
it was struck down and so it's been

1731
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:31,160
repressed a sense then.
And a lot of it has just been pure

1732
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:33,920
racism actually.
That's the cause of it.

1733
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,020
Well,
that was what those recent papers were

1734
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:39,890
released about the Nixon administration.
That's one of the ways they demonize the

1735
01:35:39,891 --> 01:35:42,380
black rights movement,
civil rights movement,

1736
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:47,090
and also the antiwar movement is they
attack marijuana and they attacked

1737
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:51,020
psychedelic drugs and that was the
reason why they pass that sweeping

1738
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:54,770
legislation in the first place,
was just to be able to have a reason to

1739
01:35:54,771 --> 01:35:56,540
arrest those people.
They knew they could attack the

1740
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:58,850
communities and attacking those
communities.

1741
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:02,780
The best way to do it was to go after
the drugs next and hated them.

1742
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:07,870
And Nixon was a traitor to America.
Nixon was probably with Bush,

1743
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:16,960
one of the worst we've ever experienced.
And through his hatred and venom,

1744
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:22,100
we have the drug war that now for over
40 years,

1745
01:36:22,101 --> 01:36:27,101
we've just been laboring under the boot
of a fascist trader that want resigned

1746
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:28,963
from office.

1747
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:29,860
He was,
he was,

1748
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:32,710
he was impeached really?
And that I wanted to say,

1749
01:36:32,711 --> 01:36:34,750
go back to what you were saying about
fungus,

1750
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:37,680
because people sometimes ask,
what does l,

1751
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:39,340
what is Lsd,
what does it,

1752
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:40,990
what does it look like?
What is it?

1753
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:44,110
And I wanted to mentioned that,
uh,

1754
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:48,850
recently there's microscopic images of
what it is,

1755
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:53,470
is it's fungus growing on Rye.
So there's these microscopic images that

1756
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:57,340
you can call up and look at that.
See the LSD.

1757
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:00,940
It looks like a field of little tiny
mushrooms.

1758
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,070
That's all just microscopic.

1759
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:04,730
Well,
do you remember the,

1760
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:08,330
um,
the revelation that they had the few,

1761
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:11,720
few years back when they were trying to
figure out what caused the Salem witch

1762
01:37:11,721 --> 01:37:16,721
trials and one of the leading theories
was that they had had a late frost and

1763
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:23,180
the late frost had caused these funguses
to bread,

1764
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,810
herbal or God to grow on bread and that
when that happened,

1765
01:37:26,811 --> 01:37:31,370
these people were experiencing very acid
like effects from eating bread.

1766
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:34,580
And then they started freaking out and
blaming people for it and thinking that

1767
01:37:34,581 --> 01:37:38,150
they were being possessed.
And it was a whole wave of paranoia that

1768
01:37:38,151 --> 01:37:42,110
came from that unbelievably fascinating.
When you think about it that way,

1769
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,200
it really is.
It's actually the,

1770
01:37:45,201 --> 01:37:47,930
uh,
to be cured from ergotism.

1771
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:49,490
Um,
this,

1772
01:37:49,491 --> 01:37:50,324
uh,
uh,

1773
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:51,490
Bishop,
uh,

1774
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:56,130
Flo bear,
he was responsible for sharp cathedral

1775
01:37:56,270 --> 01:38:00,810
a thousand years ago,
basically prayed to Mary and said,

1776
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:04,240
if you'll cure me of this ergotism,
uh,

1777
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:08,160
which is very dangerous,
but it leaves so many visions,

1778
01:38:08,161 --> 01:38:11,250
I will build you the most beautiful
tempo ever built,

1779
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,580
you know?
And so he was cured and he did found a

1780
01:38:14,581 --> 01:38:16,320
sharp cathedral.
But,

1781
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,460
uh,
as a result.

1782
01:38:17,461 --> 01:38:21,300
So that's one of the core things about
ergotism Ergot,

1783
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:26,360
but the coolest thing is definitely lsd
and Hoffman's ability to stabilize that.

1784
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:29,383
Uh,
yeah.

1785
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,330
Uh,
and then,

1786
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:35,220
so basically the coolest thing about the
psychedelics to me is that they,

1787
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,690
uh,
in the end,

1788
01:38:36,691 --> 01:38:40,980
the science that has been done as the
Good Friday experiment and Roland

1789
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:45,720
Griffiths work and that has basically
given us the best evidence for the

1790
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:50,721
existence of God because 65 percent of
people who take psilocybin in it safe,

1791
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:55,110
set and setting in there spiritually
inclined,

1792
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:59,130
we'll have a full blown mystical
experience that's now science.

1793
01:38:59,131 --> 01:39:03,020
It's proven.
So a majority of people who take a

1794
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:07,730
psychedelic basically in a positive
setting and they don't know,

1795
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:10,800
they're not a priest gets sold
themselves,

1796
01:39:10,801 --> 01:39:12,690
you know,
not a borderline personality.

1797
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:13,650
If you're stable,

1798
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:15,290
priest gets zone.
Yeah.

1799
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:16,750
That's important to put out.
You know,

1800
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:19,610
because I think that a lot of people
think that psychedelics are for

1801
01:39:19,611 --> 01:39:20,830
everybody,
but they're not.

1802
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,420
Unfortunately,
there's some folks amongst us that have

1803
01:39:23,421 --> 01:39:28,421
a very difficult time with just regular
stable sobriety and mental issues.

1804
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,960
No,
but I think in the end they're going to,

1805
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,630
with science,
with medicine and science,

1806
01:39:33,631 --> 01:39:35,760
I think what's going to be found out is
that,

1807
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,130
uh,
these psychedelics are going to cure

1808
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:40,680
schizophrenia.
I really think that when they,

1809
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:44,370
when they use it properly,
because that's what the science is doing

1810
01:39:44,371 --> 01:39:46,830
now,
they're experimenting with all kinds of,

1811
01:39:46,831 --> 01:39:50,430
with schizophrenia what science is,
if there's any studies with

1812
01:39:50,431 --> 01:39:51,840
schizophrenia.
But I,

1813
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:54,810
I,
because it mirrors schizophrenia,

1814
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:57,120
it may be,
um,

1815
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:00,090
I don't know.
I think that research will be done

1816
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:05,510
related to all kinds of psychological
illness and um,

1817
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:08,580
but anyway,
it's curing so many things that can cure

1818
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,700
a cluster headaches.
And the studies are,

1819
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:12,630
you know,
like Harvard,

1820
01:40:12,631 --> 01:40:14,220
Yale,
Johns Hopkins,

1821
01:40:14,221 --> 01:40:16,270
all that big,
all the big universities that can,

1822
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:19,350
that maps can get funding for their
funding.

1823
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:20,184
All that

1824
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:25,530
maps is really fascinating and amazing.
And what they've done is just add a,

1825
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:29,000
a,
an actual intellectual perspective on

1826
01:40:29,001 --> 01:40:34,001
psychedelic drugs and undeniably
researched really well documented

1827
01:40:34,701 --> 01:40:36,350
perspective.
That's so important.

1828
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,110
When I had,
um,

1829
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,710
my first experiences with,
um,

1830
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:43,970
with maps,
I remember thinking like,

1831
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,160
thank God there's someone like this out
there.

1832
01:40:46,190 --> 01:40:48,380
Some someone like Doblin out there,
Rick Doblin,

1833
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:53,410
who has taken the super intelligent
approach to recognizing what

1834
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,950
these substances are and what are the
positive benefits are and how can you

1835
01:40:56,951 --> 01:41:00,520
get these things slowly but surely
through the legal system and that's what

1836
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:04,160
they're doing now with Mtma.
That's what they're doing now with the

1837
01:41:04,161 --> 01:41:08,770
studies that they're doing on a soldiers
with posttraumatic stress disorder and

1838
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,840
all sorts of other people to police
officers.

1839
01:41:10,841 --> 01:41:13,300
Anybody rape victims?
Yeah.

1840
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:16,050
Violence victims.
I think that's,

1841
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:18,310
it's so important.
It's just the,

1842
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:22,960
these are really beneficial things that
were being denied and were being denied

1843
01:41:22,961 --> 01:41:26,110
by people who haven't experienced them,
which is the most ironic aspect of it.

1844
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:28,870
It's like something having penicillin,
but they won't let you try it.

1845
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,800
Yeah.
Because,

1846
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:32,590
you know,
they don't use it themselves and we know

1847
01:41:32,591 --> 01:41:37,591
that such things as Ibogaine exist.
There is a way to interrupt opioid,

1848
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:42,670
uh,
addiction and the addiction process.

1849
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:46,830
This is a potential cure for,
uh,

1850
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:52,020
the many millions of people who are
currently opiate addicted.

1851
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,960
Ibogaine therapy has been working out
miraculous results for people.

1852
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:01,330
It helps them turn around their lives
and,

1853
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:02,730
uh,
to uh,

1854
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:06,010
stop needing the chunk two to three
days.

1855
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:06,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

1856
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,110
That's,
it's a treatment.

1857
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:11,590
It's literally miraculous.
We know it exists.

1858
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:13,150
It's a,
you know,

1859
01:42:13,151 --> 01:42:17,170
the Department of Defense.
So how to be using it for our poor fats

1860
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,020
that have returned from an unrighteous
battle.

1861
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:23,320
The whole cause of their suicidal
behavior,

1862
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:28,620
I believe is because they were told to
go buy into an unrighteous battle.

1863
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,880
It was a war waged on lies and only to
create basically to kick a kick the

1864
01:42:37,931 --> 01:42:39,910
Hornet's nest,
you know,

1865
01:42:39,911 --> 01:42:44,310
to keep an endless war going.
It's working pretty good.

1866
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,200
Well,
posttraumatic stress disorder.

1867
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:52,201
What's really fascinating about it is
that there's this reaction to stress too

1868
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:58,210
intense stress,
traumatic situations and that your body

1869
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:02,920
has.
This is almost this intense anticipation

1870
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:08,010
of a constant battle of constant stress
and that that can be interrupted and

1871
01:43:08,231 --> 01:43:10,140
that this is.
There's really no other method.

1872
01:43:10,141 --> 01:43:11,770
I mean,
you can go to therapy all your life and

1873
01:43:11,771 --> 01:43:16,210
slowly perhaps slowly erode the memories
of this and give yourself some

1874
01:43:16,211 --> 01:43:18,940
psychological tools to manage these
experiences.

1875
01:43:18,941 --> 01:43:22,840
But as far as like something that can
sort of stop it in its tracks,

1876
01:43:22,841 --> 01:43:25,300
there's never been anything that's
demonstrated that has the power of

1877
01:43:25,301 --> 01:43:27,300
psychedelics.
Post traumatic

1878
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:32,300
stress disorder studies are showing that
85 percent of vets that have at and are

1879
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:39,060
otherwise untreatable are,
are having success after one treatment

1880
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:44,190
and maps got a grant to do a second and
third trial.

1881
01:43:44,191 --> 01:43:46,980
That means that people 15 percent who
didn't,

1882
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:48,420
uh,
you know,

1883
01:43:48,421 --> 01:43:51,590
really feel relief from posttraumatic
stress disorder,

1884
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,180
get a second turn and a third term.
So it's,

1885
01:43:55,181 --> 01:43:56,360
it's amazing,
uh,

1886
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:57,573
many

1887
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:02,420
the substance,
but it's the psychological therapy

1888
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:03,530
relationship.

1889
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:04,680
Well,
it's also the reset,

1890
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,150
the reset,
the control,

1891
01:44:06,151 --> 01:44:09,720
alt delete for the mind,
the resetting of the consciousness that

1892
01:44:09,721 --> 01:44:11,940
I think so many of us operate on
momentum.

1893
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,150
We operate on the momentum of our past
and that's all we know.

1894
01:44:15,151 --> 01:44:16,110
And that's sort of the,
the,

1895
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:18,150
the,
we,

1896
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,400
we were,
were connected to that momentum,

1897
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:22,140
like a safety blanket.
Like we,

1898
01:44:22,141 --> 01:44:25,170
we believe that this momentum equals the
future.

1899
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:28,800
And then it's very difficult to get out
of those grooves that are so deeply

1900
01:44:28,801 --> 01:44:30,780
carved in our consciousness.
That's right.

1901
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:33,120
And almost nothing does it,

1902
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:38,150
but MTMA will allow you to get that
distance and a for you.

1903
01:44:38,731 --> 01:44:41,930
And in order for you to,
uh,

1904
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,690
transform out of a phase,
you know,

1905
01:44:45,691 --> 01:44:49,410
the psychologist basically say that you
have to be able to look at your

1906
01:44:49,411 --> 01:44:52,880
subjective state from an ob,
you know,

1907
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:57,870
another objective observation on that
subjective state.

1908
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:01,350
And so that's literally what's happening
with the,

1909
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:05,370
uh,
Mtma your distanced from it.

1910
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,810
You can look at your behavior or your,
uh,

1911
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,420
what happened to you in,
with more dispassion.

1912
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:16,530
You can have compassion on yourself,
you know,

1913
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:17,580
and,
uh,

1914
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:21,480
start to forgive everyone involved.
And it's,

1915
