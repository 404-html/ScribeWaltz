1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,640
It's going right now.
This is it.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,320

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,800
Oh boy.
Buckle up bitches.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,980
Because may Miller and our pal Ryan
Parsons are here and we're going to get

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,093
the nitty gritty.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,800
We're going to dig deep to figure
out what the fuck is going down.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,500
We're going to crack

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,420
some shells and get some eggs of wisdom.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,780
Why in Parsons, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ryan is a good buddy of ours and uh, uh,

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,020
a training partner and manager
and trainer of Jason Mayhem.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,490
Miller and Jason May have.
Miller is. Hello, right.

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,820
One of my good friends from
the crazy world of MMA.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,580
Don't call it crazy, bro.
It's like derogatory. It's
derogatory. Tracy's good son.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,740
Boy. Make sure you know
image, son. Come on, man.

18
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:08,100
You're selling like crazy on that guy.
May Have Guy,

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,760
if you don't know a mayhem as he's also
hosting this this season of the ultimate

20
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:16,630
fighter opposite Michael Bisbing and uh,

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,430
it looks like it's going to be an
exciting season. Then December 3rd,

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,660
December 3rd, it's all going
to go down or May Hammond, uh,

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,060
Michael Bisping has a goal.
Old, old fashioned fisticuffs.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,290
They're going to get in there and take
care of it December 3rd at the hard

25
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:36,310
rocket or notes the palms, which is
the best place to see fights, Bro,

26
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,720
if you've never been in
the palm. So fuck for real.

27
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:42,880
We'll sell out quick. But it's,
if you've never been there,

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,870
literally the best place in the world to
see fights, the palm, those, those rows,

29
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,310
like there's not a bad seat in the house.

30
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,490
It's really like pitched like at a
severe angle with the seats going.

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,470
The Sea Turtle. Yeah. And they were like
right next to the k gladiator stadium.

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,550
It's fucking amazing. It's the
best seats ever for sure. For MMA.

33
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:03,460
I everybody that right. You agree? Brian,
you've been to a bunch of fights there,

34
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:06,550
right? Oh yeah. It's tight. It's
like, it's like the perfect size.

35
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,990
You could actually hear every noise.

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,710
It's like a private MMA
fight with your friends.

37
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,650
Even though it's like 3000 people or
4,000 people or something in there,

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,420
whatever it is.
It's the best environment for fights.

39
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,610
It's perfect size and they give a, I
can't even say anything. You know you,

40
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,190
you know you're fighting a smaller
cage off. Yeah. It's smaller cage.

41
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,110
It's the WEC sized cage. Yeah. We use a
smaller cage because it's a smaller venue.

42
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,880
It's more difficult to, we
don't have like, you know,

43
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,410
I'm sure there's like parameters
that they won't go past,

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,380
but the cage is not always the same size.
We have two cages.

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,860
There's a smaller cage and
there's a larger cage, like
the king of the cage size.

46
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,780
I guess now indicating the case is
probably a little small. Tiny. Right.

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,960
Oh Man. It was like fighting
in a phone booth. I thought,
I thought, God, I'm like,

48
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,480
man,
they were like defendant.

49
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,480
It's like one step and you're right there
on the guide. That was back in the day.

50
00:02:55,481 --> 00:03:00,210
That was Janky man. They all, yeah. It was
like literally shit would and then shit

51
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,880
like, uh, they had a it in the rain.

52
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,630
I remember going out there and think if,
you know what I mean? The case is cool.

53
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,100
But even when I was a
kid, I was like, man,

54
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,080
I don't know if I want to fight in
this. You know, like, I was like, good.

55
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,450
I like how the regulations came
where things are better now.

56
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,930
But back in the day it was like to, oh
that's cool. Just put some hay down.

57
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,100
They would make a fight right there.

58
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,960
But the way I always looked
at it as the candy canes,

59
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,710
they provided a very useful service. Oh,
they got a lot of guys fighting. I mean,

60
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,430
even if it's kind of a weird organization
are doing everything sketchy style on

61
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,520
Indian casinos only because when they,
when they were doing it,

62
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,560
they kept having fights even
when it wasn't regulated,

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,690
just because they were having
fights on these Indian casinos,

64
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,270
they weren't doing that. How many guys
wouldn't have gotten gigs? You know,

65
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,660
how many guys wouldn't have, uh, gotten
us some experience. And you know,

66
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:46,210
I don't think that people should
fight on the water, you know,

67
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:49,180
on the slip that wet and wild tea,
the cage if you've never seen it folks,

68
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,370
if you ever seen it. Uh,
no, but I've heard of it.

69
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:56,050
Fucking crazy guys were throwing kicks
and just fallen on their ass like there's

70
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,550
no way you could throw a kick,
you know,

71
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,940
you can barely throw a punch
as you move forward every,

72
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,670
I mean it was literally like some crazy
hot oil wrestling sort of a situation.

73
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,060
You only go to one kings wet and
wild. Did they only do it? Yeah,

74
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,000
they only did it last,
but no other,

75
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,190
other organizations have had fights in
the rain too. I know one did recently,

76
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,200
I forget what it was,
but not like this.

77
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,540
This is the most of it with
the whole cage for breaks.

78
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,750
Chill started slammed me into
the floor one time like were,

79
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,470
we were like 19 refi and way back
in the day and he slammed me,

80
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,890
although there's a good one
and he's family into the floor.

81
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:33,490
The floor broke through with bottles,
God down through the, I'm like, ah,

82
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,510
how do you keep fighting?

83
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,030
It was a weird thing where we like spit
back and the referee like, wait, wait,

84
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,670
wait over there in that
corner. I'm like, what am I,

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,970
what are I going to do right now? Like I
was like, this is the weird thing, right?

86
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,080
I'm sure he was thinking the faith
bang. I'm like, what the hell?

87
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,800
And then the referee comes
back and is like, okay, ah,

88
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,360
decided Florida's broken.

89
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:56,320
Just stay out of that area and then had
his fight again. I was like, all right.

90
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,490
And then it was like a gentleman's
agreement during the fight,

91
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:02,050
like circle over to that way and I'm
like, it's both stopped. Kinda was like,

92
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,620
all right over here, over here,
over here. It's like a street fight.

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,930
It was like a street fight.
Don't go by the metal thing.

94
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,950
No more like then Kimbo and famous
satellite dish in the back yard.

95
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:16,540
This is the same spirit. Same spirit
of all right, who's going to stay?

96
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,180
We're going to punch you totally fucking
base, but watch out for that thing.

97
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,200
You know, I still get asked about
Kim all the time. He's like, no,

98
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
the number one fighter. I get asked about
what I do like weird radio stations.

99
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,351
Yeah,
like you've,

100
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:29,410
I don't know the people and I call up
and they'd start talking about fighters.

101
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:32,380
Almost always some whatever
happened to that Kimbo slice.

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,780
That guy who was the backyard brawler
what was it about him that he connected

103
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,080
like he's black with a big crazy beard
and he seemed cool even though he's

104
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,060
beating the fuck out of people.
He was kind of a nice guy.

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,100
Like you shakes their hands
afterwards and he's cool.

106
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,180
So it's like you kind of can root
for him and he just goes out there.

107
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,170
Mr Debates on people,
man,

108
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,600
that was the one fight where he let
that dude punch him in the face.

109
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,920
Who's going to come, come to do is hitting
him in the face of God. Damn. If that,

110
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,030
I mean if that carried over into MMA,

111
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,020
could you fucking imagine
if he just started,

112
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:04,220
if he was really combinating Jones
could could've. You could've.

113
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,460
You could've put him against dude.
He could beat up. They tried,

114
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,590
but he was such a gap in the,
in the,

115
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,860
he was such a gap in the wrestling
area that he couldn't do it.

116
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,790
It's also not like boxing where this is
my feeling on that. It's like if you,

117
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,420
I don't think the guys are afraid to fight
and I don't think the guys are afraid

118
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,791
to learn,

119
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,330
but you can only learn so much and I
think if you're in a situation like a

120
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,290
boxing situation,

121
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,130
they would take a guy as a prospect
and people who would be intelligent,

122
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:29,030
people that were,
you know,

123
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,030
thinking about the future would invest
time and money in this guy and slowly

124
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:36,080
build them up slowly give him the fights
that he needs to make him look good.

125
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:40,250
The fights in each test is worth
when the guys, older guys, older,

126
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,560
just to just put them right in there.
It's also,

127
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:45,230
the mixed martial arts model is
very different than a boxing model.

128
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,830
That mixed martial arts model is get in
there and if you get offered a shot at

129
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,830
the title, fucking go for it. You
know what I mean? There's makes sense.

130
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,310
It's more exciting for the fans.
Yeah.

131
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,670
It's like a more hectic breakneck
pace that, but the little storyline,

132
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:00,710
if you want to call it that,
they go, you know what?

133
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,630
All of a sudden this is
happening. This is happening. Oh,

134
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm checking on my Google.
You know,

135
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,480
everyone gets involved with a sport like
Shamar barely, you know, Shamar belly.

136
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,630
His kid was on the ultimate fighter.
Really good wrestler, very athletic kid.

137
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,100
He gets his first fucking official
fight in UFC. Evan Dunham,

138
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,260
very a tough guy.
Evan Dunham.

139
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:21,020
It's like he was like a couple of
steps away from the title shot. I mean,

140
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,450
Evan Dunham is, you know,
a high level, you know,

141
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:27,410
God and Shamar is a tough fucking fight.
A real tough ficus.

142
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:31,550
Kamar Bailey is tough as shit. Dude. The
guy took a ton of punches to the face,

143
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,440
but it was like real obvious.
They were like,

144
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,750
he really shouldn't be fighting
a guy at this level yet.

145
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,220
He should be building up to that level.
Right. So that's the up to their manager,

146
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:42,980
right? Yeah. It's hard. That's
why I was going to ask you,

147
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,500
how do you make that decision?
Like how do you make the decision?

148
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,780
I mean there's a, there's a decision,
well, you know, you got to test them,

149
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:48,710
you got to see what happens.

150
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,750
And then there's the other school
of thought where like, no, you, you,

151
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:55,820
you got to make sure that you know exactly
what level he's at and know exactly

152
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,280
what level the opponents at so you can
ensure that he's going to have a long

153
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,500
career.
If you can show that he develops properly.

154
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,080
Like how do you break that down in
your head? So many variables there.

155
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,610
It's so good. She's a great example. For
first half, he wasn't making any money,

156
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,580
so he couldn't really train
properly over a 10 week period. Um,

157
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,900
we had five fights fall through.
People look them up and go, nope,

158
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:17,810
I'm not fighting this guy.
If you don't know who Soju is,

159
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,050
he's a fucking crazy powerful judo dude
who made a big splash and pride and

160
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:24,411
pride.

161
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,380
Everybody thought he was like going to
be the second coming when he knocked out

162
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,990
hood cheerio with a wrist.
They're like Rista face hurting.

163
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,740
We were talking about this we, yeah, we
were talking about, we were talking about,

164
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,120
uh, you know, tough guys that somehow or
another it just didn't click for them.

165
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,910
You know, they just start off
real good. Like Darren Rona fight.

166
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,540
God Damn when he knocked out of Rona,
Jesus fucking Christ, it was like,

167
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,550
who's going to stop this
guy? I'm gonna, you know,

168
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,540
he looked like this freak
athlete man who just,

169
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,100
when he hit a run in with that upper
caught and blasting them backwards to put

170
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,730
them out. I was like, Jesus.
He's like, he's a fucking threat,

171
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,510
but then it just doesn't happen, man.
He get, gets in there against top,

172
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,690
top level competition and he
just can't keep it together.

173
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,290
How do you know that was top level
competition? Those two fights of Rona was,

174
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,600
yeah. Yeah. What? Prior top three or four
guy at that time. Yeah, totally. Yeah.

175
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,340
Why do you think there was
a big difference between
when he fought in pride and

176
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,610
when he fought in the United States?
I think that Majesco,

177
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,890
Jason speak to this two weeks too.

178
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,140
I think the experience of getting
famous and the pressure that comes with

179
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,710
winning big fights is a lot and
it's such a huge part of this game.

180
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,590
Is it king guys deal then I forget all
the fighting stuff cause you go into the

181
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,740
UFC. Joe Silva is not going
to, I know I've asked.

182
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,740
He's not going to give you easy
fights to go along. You go to the UFC,

183
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:40,860
you have to be prepared to fight anybody.
That's what makes it cool.

184
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,670
Nobody gets brought along there. Either
you're going to go make it or you're not.

185
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,610
We're going to find out real quick and
this is why we all get so excited about

186
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:49,890
it that that is one way to look at it.

187
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:52,920
But the other way to look at it is that
if a fighter water to develop to his

188
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:57,090
utmost the best way to do it with the
engineer it and that someone you know

189
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,590
would be able to

190
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,630
no, I'm, look, I'm just
playing devils. No,

191
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,420
obviously I support the
UFC the way of doing it.

192
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:06,510
But do you think you've been talking
on even talking on like the ultimate

193
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:10,880
fighter, like watch tonight.
Okay. That we picked the,

194
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,750
we picked the,
the fighters,

195
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:17,751
we picked the fighters and this first
episode builds up to the first fight in

196
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:22,360
the house. Now picking the correct fight
and the correct fighters. You know,

197
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:25,080
you always want to try to get
your guy a path, but guess what,

198
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,850
when the competition is high, there is no
path necessarily. You know what I mean?

199
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:33,600
Like, Oh this guy. But styles do make
fights. You know, you want to pick to do,

200
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,520
if you want to get your fighter
to fight this dude, you know,

201
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,860
because more than likely his style's
going to going to prevail. But you know,

202
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,860
mixed martial arts, anything
to happen, you know,

203
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:46,380
like that night is a different night,
you know what I mean?

204
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,490
How frustrating is that coaching guys?
What does that like? I liked it a lot,

205
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:53,760
but yeah, it gave me a newfound respect
for Ryan's job cause I was like,

206
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,660
Ryan's has got to yell at me,
like whatever.

207
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,250
He just fucking telling me to
ground and pound like I got it bro.

208
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:04,230
Just tell me what to do. But,
but like, uh, once you're
doing it you're like, Oh God,

209
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,890
in my whole brain like, ah, I gotta just,

210
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,690
why am I thinking about this dude
in the shower? Like I'm just like,

211
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,790
when I'm in the shower I'm thinking about,
Oh man,

212
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,700
I've got to teach this guy this move
or I've got to make sure he does this.

213
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:19,050
I'm like, oh, why am I stressing like
it's my kids? Yeah. And then I, but,

214
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,650
but man, you only got to do it one
dude. Man, you're lucky. It's hard.

215
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,970
You got to really focus on me.
He

216
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,411
said too,

217
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:29,380
it's like when you start looking at styles
and how these things match up and go

218
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:32,980
back to, so could you, it was a safe
fight for us because he got paid decently,

219
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:35,350
had no money and we were
paying him every month,

220
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,450
couldn't get any fights and we looked
at uh, um, um, what's his name?

221
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,710
Jose Mario and said, okay, he's got
good boxing. We're pretty confident on,

222
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:48,730
so could use boxing. The game plan was
to go play. The game plan was the fight.

223
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,750
We did that same thing over and over
again for six weeks with the thought being

224
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:55,690
is take them down to the ground and
worst case scenario for him here,

225
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,720
this will get submitted.
Well it's not supposed to win anyways.

226
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,760
He's not going to get hurt.
He makes a bunch of money.

227
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,000
He gets his name out there and we thought
that he was going to go win that fight

228
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:07,000
too. So you start to look at
who's the matchups going to be,

229
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,890
had those styles match
up against each other,

230
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,420
upside and downside and weigh it out.

231
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,370
Same Kimbo when he fought in Sengoku the
first time took a fight against Travis,

232
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,810
few on 60 days notice.

233
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,460
Well I knew what Mo is capable of and
Travis view wasn't a dangerous threat on

234
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:24,130
his feet. He wasn't going
to submit moe from his back,

235
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,390
go out there and shoot a double leg.

236
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,000
In my mind they're the worst
case scenario was okay,

237
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,330
he'll have a boring fight and he'll be
labeled a boring wrestler. You know,

238
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,350
no one wants to see him,

239
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,950
but for what they paid him a lot of
money for that fight risk or reward.

240
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:36,910
It made a lot of sense.

241
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,650
It's also hard for guys when they first
break in from other sports too, right?

242
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,810
I mean how hard is it for, for a guy like
mo who comes in from wrestling, it is,

243
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,100
you know,
just elite,

244
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,240
an elite level of wrestling and then now
all of a sudden he's going to deal with

245
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:55,930
striking Nelson. He's got to deal with
shit that maybe he's not as good at,

246
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,670
you know, as, as is his key moves.
You know, just depends on the guy.

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,360
I've been Jason, Jacob, Jason,
by speaking up there at Nika.

248
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,610
What? I don't even know. What the
hell are you guys talking about?

249
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,700
I just want to dance. Joe Rogan. I just
want to go. Don't we all see? Right?

250
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,860
Like just out of nowhere.
I just was very rare that anybody gets in

251
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,670
is the mindset of a a manager,

252
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,370
someone who trains fighters
and someone who coaches guys.

253
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,110
It's a very intimate relationship,

254
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,730
man. Are you kidding me? It's
like my brother. I want to
beat him up all the time,

255
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,000
but I want to hug them all the time too.
If he did wasn't him,

256
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:32,800
you wouldn't be you, right? Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, you got it. You don't have to latch,

257
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,700
Huh? It's an odd match, but
it's not funny. It's funny.
It's, it's a reality show.

258
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:40,960
The ultimate fighter season 14 for
you, Ryan. I mean, I've known you

259
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,930
years, man. It's gotta be a
maddening job at times, right?

260
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,990
I mean, I like the chaos
of, it's how my brain works.

261
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,190
What I finally discovered I'm really
good at is taking a whole bunch of shit,

262
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,100
putting it together and making
it all work really well. Yeah,

263
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,640
he's pretty good at that. So think
of what MMA and especially for Jason,

264
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,770
I have a huge creative side,
so especially in Japan,

265
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,800
whatever you do it here too bro.
We have like cool,

266
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,670
like creative outs like where we just
like, oh hey dude, what about this idea?

267
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,200
But other than that I don't look at me.

268
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,980
May have monkeys.com that's [inaudible]
monkeys about, that's her latest one.

269
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,640
I really

270
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,270
back to your opinion on MMA and when you
and I have conversations about stuff,

271
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:23,340
I don't think we ever disagree. It's
very, very rare. Like occasionally like

272
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,650
I would if we do it, cause I'm hating and
don't want to admit that to John Jones.

273
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:30,290
When you finally gave it on judge Joe,

274
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,460
he's a friend and it's
all a bit when I'm wrong,

275
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,710
that's a superman. That's a superman.
That's it. That's the Uber Manch does it,

276
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:43,460
dude, who's just on another level.
That's ridiculous shit to do that.

277
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,520
That may have after your
fucking training for four years.

278
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,470
Yeah. That may hammer
others. Rampage have.

279
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,180
That's pretty bad when you
look at a guy like that.

280
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:57,540
That's why you want to stay two one 85
yeah, you go like that tough ass bastard.

281
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,750
He cuts down from from
a good amount of weight.

282
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,380
He looked sucked down in the way in and
then he looks swollen his day like I was

283
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:05,310
like, wow, that's a
good weight cut. He did.

284
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,810
He does a good job of cutting weight
and he's fucking, anyway, he's a beast.

285
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,180
I mean,
but he does like a big long dude.

286
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:15,860
Like he does like weird Lanky Guy Shit
at two oh five oh man. Thank you bro.

287
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,770
I was getting annoyed that my boys, you
finally microphone is down here though.

288
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,680
That's rare. That's remember when that
Shit I was telling you and you were like,

289
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,950
oh, this is the most boring thing
you've ever said in your life.

290
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,340
What was that about? I was me tiling
the microphones down. Where is it?

291
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,160
Where's the microphone? Before the show
started, I was giving, showing him how,

292
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,930
where the microphone life.

293
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,260
He was like, Hey, I even started singing.
Yeah, you got to spice it up. Oh,

294
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,530
this is how he was talking. He
was like, hey guys. Okay. So, uh,

295
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,840
around to a different level of add.

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,690
This level of vd phone
is down at the bottom.

297
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:57,290
You have taught a bit like it's a cock.
Oh Wow.

298
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,030
Why did you cut both balls? Look
experienced. Turned beyond a little bit.

299
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,310
He's been the dog, Bro. I can talk like
this. Lord have mercy. That's right.

300
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,550
Lord have mercy. Okay, let's try to
pretend the people are actually listening.

301
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,380
Whatever people are missing.
Squirt bottle.

302
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,200
Sometimes I think two together
and make one. One awesome dude.

303
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,790
I figured out that means

304
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,630
you're actually kind of like girls. I like
to date though. Very big. Crazy bitches.

305
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,910
Insane. Grown to being
arrested. Huge. La. Really?

306
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,220
You want to take my name?
Are you holding it sideways?

307
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:40,430
Like against her? Now you're
my girl. I just liked it.

308
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:43,310
I spit bonds into this mic.
Sorry.

309
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,260
Joe Rogan look hurt you. Joey
d is singing. I am. I why? Why?

310
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:51,120
What's the matter?
Oh Man.

311
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,190
Watch he has will get mad at
you for not having pencils.

312
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,250
You don't have fucking punch holes in
your house. And Joe Rogan, I don't, fuck.

313
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,230
Do you write something down Hilton?
He'll sign something.

314
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:02,180
I know will not be let it go.

315
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,880
You got to let him just ride
out that storm and crash that.

316
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,210
You don't have fucking
pencils in your house. No. No.

317
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,670
The first time he did it to
me, I was confused. I was
like, are you really angry?

318
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,940
Are you joking? Are you joking? Are
you really angry? I was like, Oh shit.

319
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:17,090
He's really angry right now. Like
about Trump is doing. But no,

320
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:20,120
but just for a moment he just
goes into a blast. Like he just,

321
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,330
I understand that dude a little
bit like I put like, he's awesome.

322
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,400
He's just got to let it out sometimes.

323
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,730
Just scream in your car
in traffic for no reason.

324
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,290
Just screamed at the top of your lungs.

325
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,980
All of the most fun people are crazy
because just got to figure out what their

326
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:38,060
crazy is and maneuver around it.
Try to let them know, you know,

327
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:42,200
that's their writing. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I know. Okay. Keep your crazy.

328
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,500
Hey Joe, I interviewed bready
today. Steven Brody Stevens.

329
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:49,410
He walked us through an Esther,
we home at your house. Oh yeah.

330
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,010
And we went through the

331
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,740
whole entire thing from start to finish.
For folks who don't know,

332
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:57,180
why don't you explain what happened?
Cause Brody Stevens, just tell us what,

333
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,500
we already pretty much got sick,
uh,

334
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,410
overseas when he was performing and he
decided to, to take like medicine to help,

335
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:05,880
like strep throat and a couple of things.

336
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:09,990
And he took stop taking his other
medicine, which was Lexapro. And uh,

337
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,880
he came back to the United
States. Uh, you know,

338
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:16,650
it was still six still taking antibiotics
but wasn't taking his medication and

339
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,520
then started to go on the, he, he,

340
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,850
he went on Tmz on hosted TMZ
for a week and he or, or a day,

341
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,750
and he said he was on Tmz as the host.
He took over Harvey spot for the day.

342
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,830
And then the next day he was having all
this positive energy about being on tour

343
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:33,180
on TMZ.
Uh,

344
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:38,181
and he started to like go to people at
Starbucks that were angry or mean or had

345
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:41,100
negative energy and would
call them out on their shit.

346
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,180
And then there was a video where he
called out a gang banger kid that was

347
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,280
hanging out in front of
the seven 11 scaring girls.

348
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,090
And so there's a video of him filming
like using his phone, filming like,

349
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:54,990
Hey motherfucker, these stuff freaking
out girls and screaming at this gang.

350
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,930
Like he was pretty much
attacking negative people.

351
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,540
And what happened is it got
kind of spinned out of control.

352
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:05,400
He was having a manic manic episode and
he got committed into a hospital wait

353
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:05,971
time out.

354
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:10,860
He was negative people where they
all negative or is he just like,

355
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,290
you know what I mean? Like people,
well complicated characters.

356
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,840
It's very interesting. We went really
into detail and, and cause the key,

357
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:20,200
one of the things he went to Starbucks
and did it like where this guy was like,

358
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,080
oh well I think what you
were saying negative people,

359
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:24,310
it's just what Brody exactly like.

360
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,270
So people could just be a dude trying
to get a fucking cup of coffee,

361
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:30,640
look like a gangster. We're, we're
establishing a Brody went crazy. So yeah,

362
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,410
pretty much. It's great boy. Now he felt
like it wasn't that crazy. No, no, no, no.

363
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,830
You know what mean fitness? No, cause I,

364
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,030
it's what I said is that if I was at
Starbucks and you just start talking to me

365
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:41,690
saying, hey, I like your shoes and
stuff, I might have not said what the,

366
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,980
what made them go crazy
with the guy said to him,

367
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,710
which was a please don't talk to me.
I would have said like, you know,

368
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:50,490
kind of amused it for a while and then
stop talking or you know, kind of on him.

369
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,680
But he, uh, it was very interesting
to listen to and now he's on,

370
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,010
he changed his medication and
now he seems like a very relaxed,

371
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,980
like kind of like he's
dissecting himself character.

372
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,100
And so we did this really cool interview
today. It's gonna be up later tonight.

373
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:05,850
But it really,

374
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,210
I can't wait to look at this cause I'm
really interested in this because for me

375
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:13,140
like man, mental illness is the
most interesting thing on earth.

376
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:18,030
I mean everyone has some form or some
variants of the normal human beings.

377
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,380
And to see this kind of thing like to
see like where this guy had the super

378
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:26,010
creative burst of like, you know, I mean,
what is that? You know, like that's,

379
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,760
that's crazy that uh, that we don't think
about that more. You know what I mean?

380
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,210
Like a lot of people can, if you're
smart and have a mental illness, you,

381
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,380
you can shift the world into a different
way of thinking. But theory about that.

382
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:40,080
Oh really? About human behavior
in general when it comes to that.

383
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:42,990
I think one of the reasons
why we were so unstable,

384
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,680
I think it's almost engineered to make
sure that we keep moving and then more

385
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,010
things get done because

386
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,840
I think that when things are stable and
when people are at rest and at peace and

387
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,960
calm, nothing, not much
gets done. Mutations. Yeah.

388
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:58,300
I think one of the reasons why
people fuck their own lives up.

389
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:01,050
It's like there's almost like a pole.

390
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,060
Like the universe has a pull
for you to fuck up to see you.

391
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:07,690
You keep making mistakes and keep
moving things in the same direction.

392
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:10,990
Make sure that things keep moving. Your
relationships always going to fuck up.

393
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,600
Your jobs are always going to fuck up.
There's always going to be,

394
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:16,900
chaos is always going to be things to
go wrong constantly and it's because

395
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,020
that's the only way things stay moving.
The only way thinks they moving.

396
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:24,610
And so you have to be flexible and pliable
as the world falls apart all around

397
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:27,800
you. Your success is dependent on
how you deal with that. Yes, exactly.

398
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:32,550
Just having this discussion
last night, it's inevitable.
You, you know, if, if you,

399
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:33,640
you either sink or swim,

400
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,610
like you're going to hit the bad lottery
sometimes get robbed outside, uh,

401
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,230
outside of your hometown,
that can happen.

402
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,350
I think that we're programmed to do
that. No, but I'm saying the bad stuff.

403
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,970
You're going to hit the lottery sometime,

404
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,180
but you can just got to power through it.

405
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,650
Just drive through this negative stuff
cause negative stop on your, you know,

406
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,810
on the road, learn from everything. I'm
convinced one part of self destruction,

407
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,501
not the whole part.

408
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:56,410
That one part is if you're not
growing or progressing in life,

409
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,970
you do something to create that chaos
where you have to do something to break

410
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:01,420
through. Absolutely. Oh yeah.

411
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:05,860
That's a good way to have
that conversation a couple
of times before and I

412
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:10,861
always admire the way you see it and it
really is that you will set yourself up,

413
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,320
you will give yourself shit to think
about. Right now. You can. Now,

414
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:17,860
what you do with that is depending on
the crash like your friend did or do you

415
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,460
use that for awareness and growth and
you can left coast in new planes really

416
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:25,420
can't ever stop growing. You can't.
If you think you stop growing,

417
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,230
you're going to fuck yourself. If you
say, this is that I'm done. I'm not,

418
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm just not even gonna think about
things anymore. I'm not going to try.

419
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm just going to relax and
you're going to get cancer

420
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,280
so I'm just going to go wrong.
Everybody got along great. Good.

421
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,150
I think I'm just going to get married,
have some dogs, you know, just chill out.

422
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,090
You got Cancer Board and you're
going to die. Keep moving.

423
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,920
You got to excite yourself.
There's got to just stimulate shit.

424
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,560
You know what I'm gonna Start doing
and we start going fishing. Why?

425
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,780
I don't go fishing and
people are fucking into it.

426
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,140
And I went to lake a steak the other day
and they're catching 25 pounds striped

427
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:03,370
bass. And I'm like, I want to catch a
fucking 25 pounds. Tripe Bass, boom.

428
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,850
More excitement, more good stuff.
That's where you got to do, man.

429
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:11,080
You gotta keep shit moving. The smart
people choose it though. Yeah. Yes.

430
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,260
Well you've got to kind of engineer your
consciousness in a certain extent or to

431
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,600
external extent. You know, he, you know,

432
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,510
there's a lot of people that purposefully
surround themselves with exciting

433
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:22,540
things, you know, cause they will, they're
like, fuck, I want life to be exciting.

434
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:26,680
I want to go even dumb shit. I want
to go rug with the bowls. You know,

435
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,540
running with the Bulls is
a perfect example of how
people insert excitement into

436
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,330
a life that makes absolutely no sense.
I get into,

437
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,160
I've never done it and I
probably would not, my thing,

438
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,670
if I was there and I was hammered and I
was pretty sure I could fucking run fast,

439
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,720
I might do it. I might know. I
might not. No, I wouldn't do it.

440
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,980
I would get real close and
then I ultimately, I'd be

441
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,530
like, I'd hear the bowls and I'd go,
what the fuck am I doing? I climb a wall.

442
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,150
You re you wouldn't, I would run
whatever I need to hold you there.

443
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:57,560
I wouldn't be like, no dude Bro, hold
me. And I would ask you to please not.

444
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,110
I'd be like, just coming.
They're coming, bro. You don't,

445
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,330
you're not even wearing a red funds.
Who's runs fast and you are a ball.

446
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
I would have to say a ball, no
shit. But yeah, but this, you know,

447
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:12,380
you gotta fucking dodge. That's
the whole thing. Just dodge. Yeah.

448
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:15,150
You got to jump a runaway from some
people that didn't dodge on man.

449
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,160
That shit looks so unfunded, but that's
the point. You don't want to be that guy.

450
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,720
I understand right that gate.

451
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,410
Sometimes it's going to happen but
you just don't want to be that guy.

452
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,210
Skydiving or Bungee.
And if you did and if you did,

453
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:29,360
you probably won't die and you'll just
have the scar and be like, Yo, I got,

454
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,860
I got hit by a bull. Like whatever. It
would be bad ass either way. You slice it.

455
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,710
Do you ever see that one video of the
bull just throwing the dude around like a

456
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:39,180
rag doll in a cobblestone street over it.

457
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,500
Over the guys heads is
flying up and bunking down.

458
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:46,570
Why is that conscious knocking down the
road stones has a fear of an overdose.

459
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,870
Irrational. It's irrational. A
friend of mine from Colorado,

460
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,390
our friend Ash Casey Atchinson just set
us up a picture of a Mountain Lion Jack

461
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,740
to dear near his house.
Fucking I know,

462
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:02,741
but 150 pound cat and then a dead thing
that runs away facet as you or I watch

463
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,040
his face Ryan, he's so into it when
he's talking about it like he gets,

464
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:11,540
so he like views.
He can see the claws coming at them.

465
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:15,770
I can tell they know why I've eaten a
pot and gone to the zoo a bunch of times.

466
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,210
That's why. Oh really? Yeah. Wow.

467
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,680
When you were actually there with the
animal is one thing like watching DVDs

468
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,020
when you're banked and that's
important. You know, it's huge.

469
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,610
But watching a real animals,
like a real animal in person,

470
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:35,360
when you're high that's, you get a,
you get a completely different insight.

471
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:39,230
When you actually see a tiger and it's
right there and you're looking at it and

472
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:42,170
you look in that its paws and you looking
at its body and you're thinking of an

473
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:45,770
American house cat and I'll fucking
bad ass. Those little things are,

474
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,100
I mean if a 25 pound house cat,
what did it kill you to be terrified.

475
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,210
He'd be fucking crazy.
Fucking 500 pound tiger man.

476
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:56,270
And when you get really banked in New
York, you're like right next to an animal,

477
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,560
you, you really, it's almost as close to
that animal attacking you as you can get

478
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,550
the other side of the glass. Well, shit,

479
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:08,150
that's as close as you can get without
dying or getting attacked. Whatever. Dude.

480
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,060
People do that on wild kingdom all time.

481
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,040
They just [inaudible].

482
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,530
I don't know. I remember the, I
remember the reruns on Saturday morning.

483
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,420
I remember that.
No,

484
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,950
but I just feel like those
animals from a different planet,

485
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,160
I don't have that fear. Like, oh my God,
this thing can kill me. I just think, man,

486
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:37,580
look at this thing. I know that I'm far
enough away from, from all that stuff,

487
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,590
so I totally take away and go,
man,

488
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:44,130
this looks like it's from
a different planet or a
different time. Like a giraffe.

489
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,590
It's books. When you look
close at it, you're like,

490
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:49,660
bad thing is alien because
it has like we like,

491
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,810
you know on TV you just
don't think about it,

492
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:55,530
but when you see it up close you realize
that this thing is from a completely

493
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:59,490
different it I don't get from giraffes,
I get it from crocodiles. Oh of course.

494
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:03,360
Yeah, of course. Well then
from a different time, like
when we were in the city,

495
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,171
we were in Sydney,

496
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:07,860
we went to that little a zoo thing that
was right in Tauranga Zoo and went to

497
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:11,120
see that giant crocodile there and you
saw that crocodile didn't you see the

498
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,650
words you want to go?
Jesus Christ and thing was fucking tough.

499
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,760
One they had was only like 18
feet or something like that,

500
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,270
but they get to be like 30 feet,
28 feet.

501
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,560
Like those things are giant man.
When I lived in north Queensland,

502
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,410
there was a crocodile in the
wildlife park there with him.

503
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,320
He had lost all of his teeth
due to fighting. So they,

504
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,140
because their brains are so small, they
go, they sit on their backs and you know,

505
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:36,150
they tickle them. They do all
cause they're real predictable.

506
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,160
So the guy takes a wooden stick and he
hits the concrete and he whacks the crack

507
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:42,750
it out over the nose with it.
And the sound was identical.

508
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,430
One time is one time his daughter
went in there and this was a huge you.

509
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,190
No way you could wrap your arms
around him. She slipped and fell.

510
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,820
Came across [inaudible] across her leg.

511
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,700
All of her abductor muscles
are leg is shattered ducks.

512
00:27:56,701 --> 00:28:00,600
Your muscles just spring up. They're
gone. She turns. It bites you.

513
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:04,700
Then across the pelvis, everything is
she. She had 23 surgeries or something.

514
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,260
Dad jumped over the fence,
started beating the crocodile.

515
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:08,730
Let's use the only way
that she got out of there.

516
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,980
That's what the crocodile with no teeth.
Wow. Oh, he turn it or leg the Jello.

517
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,390
Oh, that's weird. Imagine that.

518
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,720
I knew why. You have to tell Joe
Rogan is story. Now look at him.

519
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:22,170
He's even more scared. I know, man.

520
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,360
There's no way UFC Florida. Nah,
there's alligators around. No,

521
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:30,960
we're not doing to you. I'll see you
in Florida. Dana. No, Dana alligators.

522
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,020
I lived in Florida. Man. I used
to. I lived in Gainesville.

523
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:37,400
We used to go to the, there's a little
pond there and we would feed them.

524
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:38,780
I think it was called Lake Alice,

525
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,180
and we would go there and we would
feed these fucking alligators.

526
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,270
They were everywhere. They ate a lady's
dog while I was there. Once you see that,

527
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,630
I didn't see it. I got there right when
people were yelling and screaming though,

528
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,180
alligator came up with Jack.
This lady's dog. No, no.

529
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,380
Apparently it had probably happened
before I got alligators. Is it,

530
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,290
they're like such a good form of life.
Did that same basic pattern of evolution.

531
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,080
I've been there for ever.
You know what I mean?

532
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:07,970
Like here's the animal like this that
will live in these areas that it's like

533
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,440
just made of armor and just has
one thing, a bite. That's it.

534
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,640
They're efficient. You know what they do?
They're super efficient. What did I do?

535
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:19,510
I don't understand exactly how reptiles
work. I'll just tell the truth.

536
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,040
Here's the big thing that they
don't have to eat for a year.

537
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,760
That's what I'm saying. They just
sit there and get money, get money.

538
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,300
He kept money to sit. Meg Give you
money for the sunken and water.

539
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,520
No water hall. Was that
sound snap? It's my teeth.

540
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,950
You on the ground? Crocodile rap bro. Yo,

541
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,580
my new crocodile

542
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,450
LP about to drop by him because
his bottled water, the whole

543
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,070
bite bitches about a water hose.

544
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,720
How we do biting bitch by the water hole.
I'm coming for you.

545
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,840
There's a one,

546
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,850
there's a fucking awesome video of a giant
Crocodile Jack and a Willdabeast from,

547
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:05,880
from a waterhole and this fucking
world to bees has to be, I dunno, five,

548
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:10,750
600 pounds. I mean, how bad
the baby one? No, no, no, no,

549
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,130
no, no, no, no, no. Nother baby. My
friend, they got a full size one.

550
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,450
This fucking tried are slow crocodile.
Slow motion comes out.

551
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,800
It's enormous.
I mean it's fucking,

552
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:27,060
it wraps all of that will the beast and
just she just rag dolls that bitch into

553
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:31,590
the water and pulls in under
and it's like God damn.

554
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,890
Watch any alien movie.
Watch any monster movie.

555
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,340
That's way scarier than any
shit I ever saw a Predator do.

556
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,570
Just grabs his will that be snapped
all of it and whips in into the water.

557
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,940
That is like something
from fucking Star Wars.

558
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,950
I don't know how to do
predators kept her head Bro.

559
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:52,650
And your spine and they did have like
lasers and lasers. Yeah. Carvel scarier

560
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,920
the breath under water for over an hour.

561
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,020
They just go underwater and just let
it can go invisible dude. That's good.

562
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,280
Ah Shit Man. Dude, I miss old movies.

563
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,020
Why can't we be cool like that anymore?

564
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:08,520
It's tough to get a good movie these days.

565
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,210
I feel like if they did it all youtube
footage of like fucking the Predator

566
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:14,910
being like on Youtube, maybe
that would help. You know.

567
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:17,490
And I think it's eventually going to come
down to technology is going to get to

568
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:20,550
a point where an individual
person can make their own movie.

569
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,890
Like you're going to be able to make
your own movie with your computer.

570
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:25,590
You could probably pretty gum
pretty quick now. What do you mean?

571
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:29,970
But I'm saying with like special effects
and like cameras will be so cheap film

572
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,440
to be so cheap.
Hard drives me so cheap.

573
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,060
Computers be so cheap and the programs
that you're a publicly available to

574
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,240
regular amateurs for making movies and
putting the special effects are going to

575
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:42,990
eventually get to this
incredibly heightened state
where you're going to be able

576
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:46,860
to make a fucking avatar movie on your
own if you're smart and not if you're

577
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:50,070
smart, fuck yeah, but it's not
yet, but when that happens,

578
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,160
then you're going to see the most amazing
movies ever because it won't be so

579
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,550
many fucking roadblocks to
make an an awesome move. It,

580
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,100
it'll just your brain
and a team of people.

581
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,860
You do need a team,
you do need a team,

582
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:04,680
but you know what you don't need is a
bunch of people with money telling you

583
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:06,870
what to do in your movie.
And that's what happens.

584
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,240
I've seen it over and over
again. It's a weird thing, man.

585
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,730
What a bunch of people who
are not creative at all.

586
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,910
I want to influence the creative
process and that's what fucks movies up.

587
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,170
It's a flux TV shows up. That's
a fuck standup comedians. Wow.

588
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,610
But couldn't you say that
also that, that, that,

589
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,000
that relationship between
people who are cock block,

590
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,080
the creativity and that you think
that that has developed this,

591
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:32,400
you think if everyone was a creative
dude and not a dork during the crunch in

592
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:35,380
numbers. Oh I could.
Everybody was creative food.

593
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,980
This would be a fucking lazy ass
town. It'd be like you need, you need

594
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,230
a Dorky dude to go, okay,
this, this and this and that.

595
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:46,340
And so you had need that team
to sell it. Yeah, exactly.

596
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,890
Butlinda George you do
to create it. No, I know.

597
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:53,240
But if they don't cock block you at
sometime they feel like they're worthless.

598
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,870
Yeah. But that's not your fault.
That's why they chose that work.

599
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,010
The best shows are the shows where they
can't say shit like southpark southpark

600
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:03,590
are so gold.
Tommy's Angeles.

601
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,830
Every now and then they'd say they can't
make a cartoon where they draw Muhammad.

602
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,230
They'll say shit like that.
Cause they don't want to get firebombed.

603
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,140
That's like the worst thing
they've ever done. I mean I,

604
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,030
I don't think they have any influence
in the creative process to you na,

605
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,610
I mean from what I don't know those guys.
Right.

606
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,820
Do you think that comedy
central has anything? No. No.

607
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,700
They pretty much do whatever they want.
Yeah.

608
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,960
Because she was so successful for
so long but show so buck wild. No,

609
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,010
nobody's loved that shows

610
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,330
that shows the best observer on social
commentary right now cause they do it six

611
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:34,010
days out.
That is like the most,

612
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,710
those guys are the most amazing
dudes in show business in my opinion.

613
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,640
Plus they just want to
nine, 10, uh, Tony Awards.

614
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,240
And the only reason I know what a Tony
Award is because of these guys is a

615
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:47,530
Broadway musical award. They won
nine of those. I'm like, man,

616
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,510
those guys are genius. There's
some brilliant, and I and I,

617
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:54,340
this is crazy cause they, they've been
like a little team for so long, you know,

618
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,210
since like since college days.

619
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,990
So those guys have just been linked into
each other's brain for so long and they

620
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:03,770
got to such a good partnership. They
don't fuck each other over on anything.

621
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:07,060
It's crazy man. It's like they,
you know, it's great work.

622
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,800
Neither one of them lost her head and
that's rare when you get a couple of hours

623
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,673
together.

624
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,600
Those are the two guys.
Those are the geniuses behind South Park.

625
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,510
Probably hate people saying
that they, I don't think, yeah,

626
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:21,500
I think they're like whatever.

627
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:25,760
You know that South Park guys to the
normal person it means, oh south park.

628
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:26,630
Yeah I know that show.

629
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,950
But people who really know the
South Park guys on team America,

630
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,770
she never laughed harder. That was
like a standup. Right. You know,

631
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:38,780
in a standup comic is killing,
you know that feeling.

632
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,660
That was how hard I was laughing
at that movie. I was like,

633
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:43,250
this is the best movie of all time.

634
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,160
I'm really interested though is south
park to see what they're going to do this

635
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:50,270
season. Cause the last one at the
last season was like, like almost,

636
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:54,050
it felt like the last episode
of why, what was it? Uh,

637
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,010
there was a divorce. What's his
name? Stands Dad got a divorce.

638
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:03,011
They were divorcing at one co or Stan
Lee's moving out of south park and they

639
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:05,910
just made the whole episode seemed
like it was. Oh really? Yeah.

640
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,960
Maybe they getting bored. They
want to do something new. Yeah,

641
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,700
whatever the fuck they do. I don't
care. I'll watch it right now.

642
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,160
What if they start in their
own like 21 years old,

643
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,640
like they're all grown up though.

644
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,650
Funny fucking word and open up a whole
new set of Joe fucking being teenagers

645
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:25,820
and I would open up a whole set whenever
you guys leaking inside him for right

646
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:26,654
now,

647
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,080
just saying it seemed like a good idea
that I hope that that's not what it is.

648
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,350
You're all fired. You
got in trouble. He ran.

649
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,070
He just took a wild guess
to you told him he didn't

650
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,640
guess that.
Nobody guesses that would do that.

651
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,830
Those guys to do whatever they want and
they have such a loyal group of fans for

652
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:50,850
sure. I watch anything they do. Nothing.
Those guys put it out there. This is,

653
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:53,730
there's some things that I'll ignore.
Ignore certain.

654
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,080
There's like a certain
moves I need to go see.

655
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:58,560
I haven't seen the pineapple express
yet. What? Yeah, no, it's awesome.

656
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:01,020
I've got it on DVD. I, everybody
says it's awesome. I haven't seen it,

657
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,020
but if it south park movie comes out,
I'm seeing that shit.

658
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,280
We're that shit opening weekend.
Wait, they have one coming out? No,

659
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:13,281
but if you want to say [inaudible]
I saw drive last night.

660
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,750
Now you're gonna ruin it. If not, I don't
want to ruin no spoilers. I liked it.

661
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:23,340
I liked it. It was uh, it's, it's, it's
a real interesting movie man. It's very,

662
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,630
I don't want to,

663
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:27,800
I don't know how to describe it without
giving a lot of the plot away, but it's,

664
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:32,490
um, it's a weird movie man. The
guy plays is really detached,

665
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,640
sort of a stunt car driver who gets
hired to do bank robberies and shit.

666
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:41,400
He gets hired to be the getaway
driver. I'm liking it. It's a fucking,

667
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,550
it's a good script. It's a good movie.
So there's a lot of good shit in it,

668
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:49,270
but there's a few, what the fuck scenes,
but that's you from what the fuck?

669
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,480
What the fuck are they doing?
Come on.

670
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,020
Like when someone does something like
someone's been cautious, the whole film.

671
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,980
Right. Then there's convenience
scene where the guy gets
to get them because he's

672
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:02,970
turned his back to him like a, like
a Newb, you know? I hate unrealistic.

673
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,931
That's annoying.

674
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,420
Then I know that you're just trying
to wrap up a movie right quick,

675
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,440
man.
Skin still got 90 minutes,

676
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:13,440
90 minutes in the air when
people's acid start getting sore.

677
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,920
Let's wrap this fucker up. There's a
lot of movies like that where you just,

678
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,270
you're halfway in the movie. You're
like, wait, wait, what? What do you do?

679
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,490
The fucker you ended in this like that.
Like that movie, the Bradley Cooper Movie,

680
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,550
limitless. Like back when we
were like, that movie too.

681
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:29,280
I liked it up until the end. We're
all of a sudden, he's like, well,

682
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,560
I engineered the effect shout.
No, I'm fucking awesome.

683
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,840
I want her to feel drugged out.
I can't get off the shit.

684
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,720
It was a cheap way to end it.
It was like, Hey, I fixed it.

685
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,620
I fixed it and now it's awesome forever.
What could,

686
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,920
what could be the alternative really
though? What does he go? Come on.

687
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:49,110
And he's a billion alternatives and
often in a number of different bizarre,

688
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:52,570
direct shitty at the end
of that off the movie man,

689
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,490
didn't you wish you would come
away like I came away like man,

690
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:58,240
that movie was great and tell
people it was great. I had a good,

691
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,140
I think what could have
been real interesting is
towards the end he could have

692
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:04,980
started having psychotic episodes where
he woke up at different stages of his

693
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:07,980
life. Different days. It was
different things. Oh one day,

694
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,590
one day was him before the
pills and it was all fucked up.

695
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,500
The next day it's him running the company
and he doesn't know which one it is

696
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,240
everyday wake up in a different felony.

697
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,220
Long as you could do that back and forth
with a few scenes over the course of 10

698
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:22,140
15 minutes and free people the fuck out.

699
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,650
I know when it goes to black and you go,

700
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:30,230
that guy just frying his fucking noggins
show rogue it presents he oh limit and

701
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,230
limitless pills and woke up in
between worlds. Haven't seen,

702
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:36,920
that's how I would end it.
But I smoke weed bit.

703
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,530
Did you say you watch breaking bag?
Yeah. I love that you just started it.

704
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,180
Everybody's mad at me because
I was quoting something
about how much I liked an

705
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,330
episode. It was the first season. That's
what I watched. I watched it on the DVD.

706
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,520
I didn't watch it live so I'm still,
I'm way behind.

707
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,760
I watched him when I get tattooed and I
haven't been tattooed in a few months.

708
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,350
I just saw the first episode, the
first episode [inaudible] Sashi Sleeve.

709
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,580
Is that your name?
Shit.

710
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:07,000
I know we've got some cool tattoos.
I always look back and I'm always like,

711
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,240
man, I'm sorry I didn't get any
tattoos. You still get them.

712
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,030
Some people like them,
some people don't.

713
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,950
The way I look at it as
like skin looks cool,

714
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:18,100
but I like art better and be
like art on my skin. You know?

715
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,160
As long as you trust the artist and
you have an idea, it's really good.

716
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,180
Like the guy that I go to,
Erin Dellavedova, it's fucking
awesome man. And he does,

717
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,410
he specializes in like really big,
beautiful pieces. I mean, he's this a,

718
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,520
I'm a fan of his artwork. Like if a
Yoda was his studio where he tattoos,

719
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,480
he's got all his paintings and shit
around. And how cool is that guy? Yeah,

720
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,260
he's awesome.
He's going to do the podcast.

721
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,200
You ever thought like when
you're eight years old though,

722
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:42,580
and if you don't get it touched up,

723
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,990
you're just gonna have a rainbow
on look like shit. No matter what.

724
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,403
Who gives a fuck?

725
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,380
I'm going to look at like an 80 year
old dude who did some crazy shit.

726
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,220
It's all right.

727
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,670
You'll be in bed by six 30 and be
in bed by six 31 out on the corner.

728
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,590
They're going to call you
rainbow to break. Joey d is
when I'm 80. I just fucking,

729
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,680
just going balls out to the
fucking wheels fall off.

730
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,450
But um, he's, I got to get him to finish
this thing, man. I've met somebody,

731
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:12,910
he's like uncle Louie or something
or uncle George. Uncle Benny,

732
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,990
uncle Benny, man. He had like
an old school with tattoos,

733
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
probably like the Fayler Dan
Hardee before that shit hard man.

734
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,430
And he stole the knife at, uh, at,
he stole knife at Thanksgiving.

735
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,330
It was weird. He just got like,
yeah. He was like, where's the knife?

736
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:35,320
And he was walking around the house
with a knife in his hand. Man,

737
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:37,870
somebody get uncle Benny each week.

738
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,530
There's nothing creepier than a drunk
person is. What a knife. He wasn't like,

739
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:45,190
he was like dying.
You see now he wasn't even drunk

740
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,770
uncle.
I was with Chris Mcguire once,

741
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:53,440
I mean Chris Mcguire and when we
were hanging out with this dude,

742
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:58,060
there's a dude that used to own up
laugh, uh, the comedy Improv in Tempe.

743
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,480
And uh, there was a dude who was friends
with the owner, took us to his bar.

744
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:02,860
We're all hanging out at his bar.

745
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,400
We're going to go back to his house and
he said by the golf course, a beautiful,

746
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:09,670
we're just having a party at this
guy's place. Seems like a cool guy.

747
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,550
We all go back,

748
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,150
go back with a bunch of his friends
and all these different people. Well,

749
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:18,151
it turns out to be like one o'clock in
the morning and the guy is shit faced

750
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,050
beyond like you can't even
make eye contact with homeboy
and he's walking around

751
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:27,490
with a pair of scissors because he wants
everybody to leave his house except

752
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:30,730
this one girl and the girl was
like 19 years old and she was like,

753
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:32,470
please don't leave me here and
please don't leave me here.

754
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,190
Like this was like running around

755
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,581
his house,

756
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:38,090
kicking these people out that he just
invited in with a pair of scissors.

757
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,100
It was one of those moments. It was me and
Chris Mcguire. Was he on your Facebook?

758
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,110
That guy? Yeah, we're besties now.

759
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,620
I mean we got through this little dark
moment with him trying to stab people for

760
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:49,410
19 year old rape

761
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,680
pussy
girl and the girl looked at us,

762
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,680
she goes, please don't leave
me here with him. We're like,

763
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,150
we're not going to leave you here.
Could you come over to us?

764
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,300
And we had to like argue with the
guy. We got to show us. Look Dude,

765
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,190
she wants to leave with everybody else.
We got to go. Let her go. Just hold it.

766
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,430
You know,

767
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:08,890
there's one other couple that was watching
that used to live at home, but this,

768
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:13,420
we were close enough to get stabbed.
Not I'm saying, but what feel,

769
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,480
how does a crazy guy, I think some people,
I've seen it happen more than once.

770
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,040
Some people,
whatever it is,

771
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:23,690
whether it's alcohol or drugs or there's
some things that they take that make

772
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:25,730
them snap over and they're gone.

773
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:28,820
Ceville you see that glassy eyed look in
their eyes. They're not really, they're,

774
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,120
they're, they're, they're rational.
Conscious mind has completely shut off.

775
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,240
I've seen it with alcohol.
Some people, yes, alcoholics.

776
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,500
I have a friend who was an alcoholic
and every time he gets drunk, you, you,

777
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,600
you were very likely to see a
different version of him and he's very,

778
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,070
very likely to be someone
who you can't even recognize.

779
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:47,910
You barely know what to expect from them.

780
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:50,510
They're going to say crazy shit to people.
They're going to get in trouble.

781
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:53,180
They're going to start fights. They
don't even know who the fuck they are.

782
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,240
They don't know that I've seen it.
I used to think it was bullshit.

783
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,600
I used to think we don't want, it's just
weak. People that are just, you know,

784
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,380
they don't want to take responsibility
for their actions. So they go, Oh man,

785
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:06,590
I blacked out. Oh man, I just got so
fucked up. I don't know what I'm doing.

786
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:11,030
I don't get that because I don't get that
drunk. I get drunk, but I'm me drunk.

787
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,290
I don't snap over. Some people do
though. They fucking for sure, dude. Man,

788
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,510
I've seen it and I know
you've probably seen it too.

789
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:22,660
They dance with the devil and
all of a sudden, you know,

790
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,430
there's some people, there's a different,
you know, like some people say, man,

791
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:29,480
I can't smoke pot. Okay, I understand.
There's people that can't drink.

792
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:33,560
They fucking can't. They just can't.
Everybody has their own biological thing.

793
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:37,190
You know, there's a reason why some
people are allergic to peanuts. You know,

794
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,370
some people it's, you know, it's
fucking tuna fish. You know,

795
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,790
there's weird things that make people's
bodies react. I can get it, man.

796
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,200
I can get it, man. He's hammered on
tuna fish. That guy is such a Dick,

797
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:50,561
right?

798
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:54,410
Like fucking every time he drinks the
juice out the kid like pushes it and I

799
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:57,190
don't think if you were allergic to
it would make you hammered. Yeah.

800
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,150
I don't know how you made that,

801
00:43:58,151 --> 00:44:01,270
but have you ever seen them
blessing your connection?

802
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:07,000
You ever seen a list of like things that
you're not supposed to give dogs like

803
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,770
that are completely poisonous to jog,
but there's range on there like grapes?

804
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,380
No,
I'm calling bullshit on grants bro.

805
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,900
My pit bull used to eat grapes like
crazy. Yeah. They were like, I don't know.

806
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:24,340
I think someone started that Internet
fucking Roemer. I went through a dog,

807
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,240
a dog poisoning recently.
So I was given a list of,

808
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,160
of things that not to give your dog.
And there was some things on there

809
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,520
that I just would never have thought of.
Things like, uh, I can't even remember,

810
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,840
but it was something weird like
that. Grapes or nuts. There's some,

811
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:44,220
like if you give like a certain
kinds of nuts, chocolates alert,

812
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,340
they're allergic to chocolate.
So the cocoa, Oh and here's,
here's another thing.

813
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:51,610
Did you know like plums or like anything
that has a core in the middle of it and

814
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,970
it's like really,
really poison.

815
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:56,400
So like if you have trash and
the dogs going through the trash,

816
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,050
lot of times they like
to chew on like the,

817
00:44:58,051 --> 00:45:02,180
the core of like a plum or are
you trying to say huh? Yeah,

818
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,900
it's got like a chemical in it that

819
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:09,180
I tried to say that you killed
your ex girlfriend's dog. No, no,

820
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:12,620
I'm not saying that happened
at all, but uh, well hey,

821
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,920
but I gave my dogs a plumbing.
Didn't matter. Players
aren't killing the dogs too.

822
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,850
Shit would have heard of that.
Right?

823
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,580
Everybody would know by now that dogs
eat their own shit and then run the

824
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,570
quarter mile away. Fascinating.
Well, usually if they get sick,

825
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,690
usually if they get sick or eat
something, they usually throw it up. So,

826
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:35,100
but they will still ask the dog run a
quarter mile after eating three or four

827
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:37,430
large mouthfuls of shit.
Dog

828
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,030
fucking fly. Yeah, you're
right. I'll show you.

829
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:46,530
Couldn't even fucking help to
keep up with that shit eaten dog.

830
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,750
Mouthful Shugg g shit breath.

831
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:53,850
And Shit smeared over it.
Shitty gums,

832
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,190
shit on his lips and he's running
like a bullet with no problems.

833
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,510
Not even a little hint of
bias. Your pantomime is our
point there. Good. Fuck it.

834
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,230
That's exactly how it'd be.
Poppin right there. Yeah.

835
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:13,080
Miles a day till fucking four legs.
You can't fuck before an exit. Period.

836
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:16,860
Fecal matter in this because it's
an exponentially faster animal.

837
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,370
Four legs.
There's a whole body whip effect.

838
00:46:20,371 --> 00:46:24,660
They get a lot going on that we don't
have. My hot dog dog can jump. I bet.

839
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,210
He's like no. His whole body, he
bring you up right in the spring.

840
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,300
You told me the story of a, you got into
a physical fight with your massive ones,

841
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,080
right? It's true. Massive
fought for 30 seconds,

842
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,870
30 seconds, whatever. Fucking,
how big was it? 150 pounds.

843
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,420
That's how big it looks like a
little bigger than my dog, man.

844
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,890
How did this shit unfold? That's
playing. Otherwise it was,

845
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,060
we were young. It was 2124
years old. You get four or five.

846
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,420
I was like, wait, you were the math.

847
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,220
I made mistakes in the past.
Like

848
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,300
one day I just gave him his food in there.

849
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,820
I contacted him and it was on, you
know, I should have known him, man.

850
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:24,210
He's a dog. Can I contact
him and challenge his space
where he giving him food?

851
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,780
Don't look at them. Listen, here's
your food, bitch. You don't do that.

852
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,100
They give the dog,
you pat on the back and you walk

853
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,490
away. Make it makes always make contact
with the dog while he's eating this food.

854
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:34,350
So he's comfortable with that.

855
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,250
Doesn't think you're going to steal
food from when you touch them.

856
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,563
That's what keeps that,

857
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,240
that when some dogs and you touch them
when they're eating and they turn on you.

858
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,270
So what was the catalyst?
Yeah, I started off the Bra.

859
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:48,540
Dan Henderson had intact to pitbull who
lived with us and they fought probably

860
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:51,720
20 times. Oh my God.
That day, the day that

861
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,770
you guys are like, how many matches
have to go on this so far? It's crazy.

862
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:02,710
[inaudible] we got to get rid of the
dog. It's like one dog's got to go.

863
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,760
I love pit bulls,

864
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:08,010
but I laughed my ass off when people
tell me that they're not dangerous built

865
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,770
the kill we talking about. I love them.
They're my favorite dogs of all time.

866
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,530
But if you've had pit bulls,
you know they're dangerous as fuck.

867
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:19,150
It doesn't matter how much you train
them either is lying to themselves or or

868
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,200
you know like trying to lie to you
make them feel better about it.

869
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,480
A pit bull that I trust,
I don't care how much you trained it.

870
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:29,260
If it has it's balls and to mail.
I trusted around another dog.

871
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,450
I just don't, I don't, especially
if the other dog has his balls,

872
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,500
especially the other dogs,

873
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:39,790
a male and it gets even a little frisky
and especially if it's a Neal fighting

874
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:44,490
Brianna, some big crazy always dog
so that they both had balls. Wow.

875
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,580
About danger zone. That's too too wild
monsters or he had two handfuls and they,

876
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,250
I got so good at stopping the dog fight.
Excellent.

877
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:57,030
Then I could actually pin both
of them down and I need that.

878
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,710
You're wrestling really came about.

879
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,400
If you were a guy that didn't know how
to use your body weight things down,

880
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:07,480
did you get like under hooks on your dog?
Like I hold technique.

881
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:11,800
I didn't really neon belly or one
throat and pinned the other one.

882
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:14,560
Dan and I couldn't sometimes.
Most of the time I needed help,

883
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:16,090
so it just started calling
for whoever's there.

884
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,970
Then you had to go reach in
each dog's mouth and open them,

885
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:22,930
which isn't that hard to do actually
all that's why I'm not at all afraid of

886
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:26,770
dogs. No, it's really not
clamped down. Once you open,

887
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:28,300
if they shut down on your fingers,

888
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:34,240
but even thought they only have one
weapon, you know it's coming. Yes,

889
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,070
but still it can get you,

890
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,890
you know that's like Henderson right
now I'm with Brian [inaudible] gets you

891
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,920
just keep, you have to shove it into
their maps and then if it got really bad,

892
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:47,080
I just start poking holes.
Hopefully they have a collar.

893
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:50,140
I took my dog out when I was trying
to kill my cat ones with his collar.

894
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,090
I got neon belly and I choked him out.

895
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:55,650
I can put in my sleep and wait with
this color. Yeah, it was college.

896
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,360
Did you do like cross your hands a bit as

897
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:03,010
I got inside and put him in one block
composition position. Very good.

898
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:07,960
Mic Cooks make, make note here. I
put in a finito belly and I turned,

899
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:11,230
I turned it all. He'd go out.
Did Doug, you sleeping good now?

900
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:16,420
Plum pit texts at cyanide in him in grapes
cause kidney failure and dogs. Wait,

901
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:20,680
so you're telling me if I ate pumps, the
middle of it, the guy listen to this man,

902
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,240
I would die. It depends how much you
eat. If I work with, I'm sorry I do that.

903
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:28,190
I work with, this is going,
I got to before, forget this

904
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,000
guy.
His mom died from fucking Tylenol.

905
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,150
This mom got liver poisoning as your mom.

906
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,730
She died because he was taking Tylenol,

907
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,720
which has like whatever the fuck the
chemical it has and it also exists in some

908
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:43,550
other cold medication that she was taken.

909
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,490
She was taking the two of them at the
same time and she had fucking liver

910
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:50,570
failure. Oh that's wrong. Yes you did.

911
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:53,320
You know that that was even possible.
Every drug you can die from

912
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,720
mixing certain things like lot of times
if you look on something and say don't

913
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:01,520
take whatever that chemical
is in town with that,

914
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:04,250
I think it's like Apha Firebird.
I mean [inaudible]

915
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,993
have your input.

916
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,830
100,000 people a year die from
appropriately prescribed medication.

917
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,100
We know it just surpassed car accidents.
Yeah.

918
00:51:16,101 --> 00:51:20,030
Most recently prescription drugs have
surpassed car accidents for a accidental

919
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:21,260
deaths for the first time.

920
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,440
They don't do stet when especially
when people take you take five drugs,

921
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:29,410
you ever been 100% chance of having an
adverse reaction to it? No one did appear.

922
00:51:29,411 --> 00:51:33,230
Have you studied good double blind
controlled studies on those four or five

923
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:37,130
drugs together? That's why I only take
Alpha brain and nothing else. Yeah,

924
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,720
on a.com oh and it, oh yeah, I've
got to plug your shit seriously.

925
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:46,721
Joe [inaudible] it properly
because this this thing,

926
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:51,620
okay, I really wanted to hate on you.
I'm just going to tell the truth.

927
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,150
I'm going to,
you know what I mean?

928
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:57,860
Cause I did the cool guy shit and I went
online and I bought all my uh, you know,

929
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,520
kind of what you got in there separately
and I, okay, this is a good mix for me,

930
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,850
but I don't know,
did I took that stuff and man,

931
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:08,360
I smashed people at video games yesterday.
I mean that's my gold standard.

932
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,210
My brain was focused. I was
watching the video games, clothes,

933
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,040
like I think about it,
but I was like a robot.

934
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,440
I feel like it's like a mild Adderall.
Like I, I don't feel like I'm on anything,

935
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:23,030
but I feel so focused and I have to reveal
though that there's been a few people,

936
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:26,360
very small number.
Most people like the vast majority,

937
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:30,170
over 90% of all the tweets and emails
I get are positive. More than that.

938
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:33,380
You said it's like 99 I would say it's
like 100 101 I hate on you though.

939
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:34,880
Made me,
but one out of a hundred,

940
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:36,560
they don't seem like their hate
and they just say it. Dude,

941
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:39,020
it did nothing for me whatsoever.
And I believe that. Yeah,

942
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,330
everybody's got their own.
Some people. First of all,

943
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:43,910
I got to know where you're at. I don't
know. Are you smoking cigarettes?

944
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:47,630
So you got to shape, are you ill? You
know it was $29 half your paycheck.

945
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,010
That could be it too.

946
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,650
A lot of people are upset at the
price and this is what I said,

947
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:53,480
I said real clear. Yeah. I said, listen,

948
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:57,800
this is the highest quality shit and
we get it from the best manufacturers.

949
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:02,750
We put it in a really well calculated
form, but steal it, steal it.

950
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,220
Go online and see all the ingredients.
Go get your own ingredients.

951
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:12,140
I have scoop it off the shelf.
Well do that. If you can't,

952
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,660
no, don't do that because somebody
had high it. Man, that's rude.

953
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,810
I had to steal the formula. I
don't know man. I don't think,

954
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:24,650
okay if 29 bucks and not that
expensive for that kind of thing,

955
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:29,910
it is all the, all the uh, all the other
stuff, buying the stuff separately,

956
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:33,440
costs a lot of bugs and it's the
quality of all this chemical stuff.

957
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:38,130
If that mixed doesn't work for you when
you lost 29 bucks. They know what I mean.

958
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:42,630
Like so what? But you know, I dunno
the benefit for me man. I'm stoked man.

959
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,450
Well mine's, I'm stoked about it
cause they have a super clear,

960
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:46,290
I did an interview today.

961
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:50,550
I was like okay my brain works and
that was after training for two hours.

962
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,980
So people don't want to
believe in it and that's fine.

963
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:55,260
And there's a lot of people
that say there's no science
behind it, but there's a,

964
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:58,580
there's a science paper on the site.
It shows with references. It's a,

965
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:03,530
a medical editorial written
on the efficacy of this
Alpha brain stuff. And it's,

966
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:07,500
it's based on reactions man. It's based
on things that people have noticed,

967
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:11,170
you know, hey you take this, this happens
and put it all together and it has a,

968
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,610
as people get annoyed cause we talk
about it all the time. But I wanted to

969
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,320
talk about,
well people talk about,

970
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:23,400
I talk about also people being annoyed.
What does that knows? Is that your phone?

971
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,700
Someone's phone. That's
fine. That's your phone.

972
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,540
People being annoyed that we
talk about it. But I wanted,

973
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,940
I wanted to get your take on it,
which is why I had them sent. Right.

974
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,160
Are they gonna are they gonna sell
them in bulk? Like huge container.

975
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:38,010
We will eventually. I think that's
the way to go. Like 10% off.

976
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:39,900
If you go to Joe rogan.net there's a link,

977
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,710
you click on it and enter in the code
name rogue and you get 10% off of it big.

978
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,600
Now let me touch your beard bro. Oh
I just cut it off. But um, so, um,

979
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,480
so when you, when you took it, how many
days a week did you take that shit?

980
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:56,040
I'm taking it for four days. Did you
notice it right away? Pretty much.

981
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,500
I'm excited because I've
only been gone for four days.

982
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,540
I want to see what happens later.
Like I'm like,

983
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,210
cause I was feeling very
like I don't know man.

984
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,850
Whatever I say I say
that stuff is awesome.

985
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,440
I don't know how the hell
you figured that out.

986
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:12,110
It's not mean it's a Aubrey our buddy,
he's the smart one. Alright. Cause.

987
00:55:12,111 --> 00:55:17,040
Yeah cause I'm like, oh I feel like
man, pretty bogus. It's pretty awesome.

988
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:21,630
Like I, I feel good that my friend
made up something that was good,

989
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:26,360
like way better. Like the like a,
that movie warrior was good. And My,

990
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:29,640
I'm friends with one of the guys who like
wrote on on the thing and I was like,

991
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,730
ah, I hope this is good. And I
thought like, man, that's really good.

992
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,630
I feel good when my friends and now
you give me these fricking pills.

993
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,660
And I'm like you sure that's not
a placebo effect. No, I know.

994
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:41,190
That's what I'm worried.
That's what I'm thinking.

995
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,860
I'm really trying to in my head go,

996
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,270
okay he goes the other way every
time I go all the way. Yeah.

997
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,030
I go and some bullshit a bullshitter.
Don't think it is. It's true.

998
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,120
I think recently I've, because you
gave me that new bottle and it,

999
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:57,120
cause I was out for like two weeks and
for those two weeks I was starting to

1000
00:55:57,121 --> 00:56:00,100
feel icky again.
And then I've been taking it nice.

1001
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:03,360
I hope it doesn't get put on a PDS
list. I don't think a woman, it's all,

1002
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,670
it's all vitamins. I know, but
what I'm saying is, you know,

1003
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:10,650
if I have a brain advantage, yeah,
well it's illegal to right vitamin B.

1004
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,660
There's some other shit that we're selling
now that's a based on the courthouse

1005
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:17,070
steps. Mushroom. Do you know
anything about that Shit, Ryan?

1006
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:21,140
Cause I know you're [inaudible] I didn't
know that you will. I didn't know that.

1007
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:25,420
That's what it was when you said it. I
didn't realize cordyceps was, uh, was, um,

1008
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,220
I had a lot of through
federal court is sentiment.

1009
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,870
And earlier in my career I saw
that, yeah, I could, uh, I use it.

1010
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:36,100
It helped my weight. And, uh, and what
do you call it? Uh, uh, and my cardio.

1011
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,420
So I remember I was doing judo tournaments
and doing Jujitsu tournaments when I

1012
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:43,360
was young. I would take that stuff
and it made me feel real good.

1013
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:47,160
That's crazy though, that, uh, I didn't
even know that cordyceps mushroom.

1014
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,180
I was like, someone said,
you've got to take course up.

1015
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:52,690
So one of the trainers there, and I was
like, all right, I'll take it. And then I,

1016
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,630
uh, I didn't put the hell is the
court itself, what does it look like?

1017
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,930
Is it like a little blue mushroom?
What does it look like?

1018
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:01,610
What's the court is set as a good
question? Google that come on.

1019
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,150
Mushrooms are so fucking good for you.
There's so many mushers. I take Chaga,

1020
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:10,210
mushrooms, those asked me really
good for your immunity. You know,

1021
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:11,590
I take a bunch of different things.

1022
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:13,510
Just knowing that I'm going
to go on the road a lot,

1023
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:17,890
I'm going to be around a lot of, you
know, you know, icky things and you know,

1024
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,960
so I take a lot of probiotics,

1025
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:23,290
but I also started taking these Chaga
mushrooms because I read up on them like

1026
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:26,110
how, how good they are and
many health benefits mushrooms.

1027
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,630
What does it do for you?
Oh,

1028
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,190
there's so many different things that
it's good for your immune system. It's,

1029
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:34,630
it's like an antioxidant or like when
would the best thing about probiotics?

1030
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:37,750
Anything that you're taking a mushroom
man, I always drink those or the little,

1031
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:41,200
you never drink it the little,
um, what's it called? Yeah,
yeah, yeah. As Eva things.

1032
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:46,360
The bio kids. Yeah. Bye. Okay.
Oh, you have it tastes good
there. You could tell man,

1033
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:51,130
you feel digestive like you feel
like it pushes up by far by far.

1034
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:55,850
What's it called again?
They're in the refrigerator.
They quick little yoga. Tiny,

1035
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:00,120
a little canister. Loved the idea taking
all this live shit into your body.

1036
00:58:00,121 --> 00:58:03,440
I love what I was going to say.
Let's Kombucha drinks all those guys.

1037
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:07,750
I love those things. Drink that shit every
day. Yeah. And it's really done. And, and,

1038
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,000
and um, I also bought some fucking
ridiculously expensive acid alpha list.

1039
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,890
I was like, why is he shit
a hundred bucks? You know,

1040
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,550
because it's in the frigerator.
It's supposed to be like
the highest count, blah,

1041
00:58:17,551 --> 00:58:20,800
blah, blah, whatever, you know, different
types of, more like, all right. You know,

1042
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,970
I'm not even going to do any research.

1043
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,930
I'm just going to pop one and what a
day and see what the fuck is up for 100

1044
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,280
bucks. It was like 100 bucks for a bottle
of like, not even how many times. Oh,

1045
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,010
it wasn't that big man,
you know?

1046
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:37,370
Have you seen the documentary fat,
sick and nearly dead guys nearly done.

1047
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,890
Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah, exactly.

1048
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,940
Because it's all about how that we
don't eat anything live for really,

1049
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,170
we're getting all our nutrients from
dead stuff like, you know, like uh,

1050
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,450
breads and whatnot, you know,
through all of America. Pretty much.

1051
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,590
It's easy accessible thing and
to just juice all your food.

1052
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,260
Everything's real life vegetables,
you know,

1053
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,870
and people have done like juice
fasts and stop and gone on.

1054
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:08,090
I did it in the movie 60 days with only
like he had a portable like juicer and

1055
00:59:08,091 --> 00:59:08,540
stuff.

1056
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:12,020
And then he met people on the way in
the met his trucker that was like bigger

1057
00:59:12,021 --> 00:59:15,950
than Joey d 400 and he, and then
he started doing, he's like, look,

1058
00:59:15,951 --> 00:59:18,470
just do this for 10 days.
And next thing you know,

1059
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:22,180
it was just like people were
dropping weight. He immediately look

1060
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,900
helper, like feel a lot of, I mean I
tell everybody if you could do that,

1061
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:30,650
you know it takes a lot of time and a
lot of devotion to like grind up all your

1062
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:33,780
food in a juice, you know, it helps
me out a girlfriend. Do you think the,

1063
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:36,800
you should use it or do you think you
should use that Vitamix thing? Yeah,

1064
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:40,280
the Vitamix blender. It's basically
like juice in it. But you're also, yeah,

1065
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:41,760
maintain all the stuff from the back.

1066
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:46,190
A lot of the fiber that you both
trust me dude. But that fiber drink,

1067
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,550
that's like your real drink.
Like when you grind everything up.

1068
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:52,670
But like a Vitamix blender.
It's just, that's like, okay,

1069
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,880
I'm drinking this and for me I really
like it now cause I know the health

1070
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:58,730
benefits if you feel good when I'm
drinking. But when you drink it bursts,

1071
00:59:58,731 --> 01:00:01,430
you're like, man, that's
like lawn mower juice.

1072
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,730
Like it just came out of
the juice out of the bag.

1073
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,910
It's fresh out of the bag and
they blended a little bit more.

1074
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,490
I mean suck it down. I've got the
regular juicer. It's just like,

1075
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,660
it's like a juice. You're like,
oh, I went to w, uh, top of juice.

1076
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,570
I tried to get my little kid to try it.
Oh yeah.

1077
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,820
She looked at that fucking green sperm.
It looks like hulk sperm.

1078
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,670
That's what it looks like it does today.
She says no,

1079
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,090
she's always talking about loads.
A little kid

1080
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,160
or something that triggers
my daddy's health drinks.

1081
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,560
Brian's little daughter
healing fricking hell.

1082
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,580
[inaudible] juice from six
months old. Wow. That's cool.

1083
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:45,680
With the same stuff that blended up stuff.
The Vitamix thing just to get a juice.

1084
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,500
Oh No, no. We, my daughter drinks
juices we'd get from the press.

1085
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:52,910
Juicery there's a place that they use
some sort of crazy hydraulic cold press.

1086
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:55,930
Something that is better than
grinding it out. It'll grow.

1087
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,860
Lamar juice that little, his
little girl, she has a crazy dot.

1088
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:04,340
Well her diets, amazing cooks.

1089
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:09,170
Everything from home organic. She
never had any meat or dairy. Really?

1090
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,260
Yeah Bro. It's weird. She's never,

1091
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:15,200
she's been sick probably three
times in her whole life. Wow.

1092
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:19,130
No meat or dairy, Huh? It's so
crazy to see his little kid.

1093
01:01:19,131 --> 01:01:22,220
Cause usually I see little kids that are
like sticking them out and Donald's and

1094
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:27,221
this kid is like super healthy eater and
like man it's really crazy to see how

1095
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,860
that benefits a kid.
For sure.

1096
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:34,430
Traditional bag cause I could tell this
kid is like she'll never sick. Awesome.

1097
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:35,880
And like really like I dunno,

1098
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,290
she at least gets the way ice
cream once in a while or anything.

1099
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:42,850
You come out really great ice creams like
um, any of those cashew nut ice cream.

1100
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,570
I love her stuff. I would
never go. No dairy cheese is
just too fucking delicious.

1101
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:48,404
I'm sorry,

1102
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:53,060
a steak and cheese with no cheese it
with some fucking whack ass vegan cheese.

1103
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,210
Get away from me sir.

1104
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,380
There's a corner in Philadelphia where
they have to steak and cheese place

1105
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,970
before. Is it patent Geno's
Geno's is it Pat's the other one?

1106
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:09,110
Somebody tweeted me the go away.
They know what the fuck they're doing.

1107
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,150
They know what the fuck
they're doing and cheeses.

1108
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:16,040
It's very important that like
real east coast, east coast,

1109
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:19,680
give me that thing that they could choose.

1110
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,990
And for a lot of dudes it's like 2:00
AM they struck out as bars and then

1111
01:02:22,991 --> 01:02:25,250
they're like, let's see what we can
get over the steak and cheese players.

1112
01:02:25,251 --> 01:02:29,280
Remember it's your pussy. You know what
I'm saying? Just get hammered and go eat.

1113
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:31,020
That's one that's just delicious.
Yeah.

1114
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:34,770
There's nothing better than fucking
greasy spoon you're handling. Oh God.

1115
01:02:34,771 --> 01:02:38,860
Just give me whatever it is.
Cheap ass.

1116
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:43,350
Fucking Pastrami. Reuben from Jerry's
Deli. You know what I'm saying?

1117
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:47,730
You know that feeling,
those those Pastrami Reuben's where you,

1118
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,950
you lather that fucking,
what is that?

1119
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:54,951
1,000 island dressing on the inside of
that bitch and just exploding in your

1120
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:58,160
mouth. Just orgasm. Oh,

1121
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,270
cheese and fucking sauerkraut.
When you're hammered, man,

1122
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:03,961
there's nothing better than that.

1123
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:06,690
People who've never been hammered or
high really don't understand what food

1124
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:11,180
really tastes like. They don't know.
You sorta know swilling your wine,

1125
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,700
your mouth. If you've never
really been hammered. Come on son.

1126
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:18,840
He never really been high. Whatever. Do
you eat some dumb stuff? You're hammered,

1127
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:23,630
bro. You like I, I've never
like, I've just like all Jack
in the box. I would never,

1128
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,240
I look at Jack in the box, especially
for professional athlete. Right.

1129
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,480
I look at that thing like all my God
does that. I'd been drunk before.

1130
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:34,860
Let the best man Jack in a box. It's
just like an orgy of flavors all over.

1131
01:03:34,861 --> 01:03:37,260
You just like squirting
mustard all over your,

1132
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:40,763
what's that again?

1133
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:45,500
Let's do it all over your 10
chance slower this time or feeling.

1134
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:46,403
Let me look through it

1135
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,360
and I don't think that that's
a healthy diet for anybody.

1136
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,130
I think your brain doesn't care.
It's just like, this is what,

1137
01:03:56,131 --> 01:04:00,000
at the caveman level, this is
what I need to survive, you know?

1138
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,430
And I don't feel like that's
how we should live our lives.

1139
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:05,650
And this is the whole foods.
All you can eat bar a local whole foods.

1140
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:09,750
You just sit there and you play it. You
just picking out of, they have like a,

1141
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,810
it's like a salad bar, but whole foods,

1142
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,930
yeah,
pay me

1143
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,320
skinny fat die of them for sure.

1144
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:26,430
But I could go and get like
unlimited chicken breasts. I'd be on,

1145
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:30,660
I didn't sit right next to the bar.
Well that's what Fogo de Chao is gangster.

1146
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:33,930
That place get mad and cussed out too.
By the way.

1147
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,710
I was going to sit on the toilet
custody. I was like, man, Joe Rogan.

1148
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:42,810
I go to child like what
does this way to you?

1149
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,700
It's Brazilian hoe depot.

1150
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:48,390
They come on round two like you're
a king with a big lamb shank.

1151
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:50,910
Like would you look some like this
so you of course you'd say yes.

1152
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,230
It's meet in your base.

1153
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,540
You know what you're going to find out
is they have a mental illness in every

1154
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:58,850
mall too, like fake ones that are just
as good and show shit. The shower.

1155
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:01,910
That was the way it by the pound.
When you,

1156
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,310
what you want to eat by the of
the fogo is all you can eat.

1157
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:09,180
Your father said toy. When I
was hurting man, I was like,

1158
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:12,240
I'm going to tweet at Joe Rogan right now.
I feel like when I,

1159
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,500
when I eat at that place,

1160
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:18,070
I feel like a real carnivore
because there's nothing
but meat. Yeah. Got to open

1161
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,150
up the poop shoot. First name,
asparagus, Broccoli, lettuce,

1162
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,750
everything in their pack, the ball or
Greens. Green's a pack your bowl first.

1163
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:30,790
Don't be scared to move them more. We can
eat the meat. Don't do it. Don't do it.

1164
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:35,260
That show we did Brock Lesnar.
You Son Herculite is,

1165
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:38,830
I'm just shit stuck up and y'all
went to Brazil last December.

1166
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:42,360
It's how we ate every day. Yeah,
pretty much. I'm so fat that

1167
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:45,911
you have to training.

1168
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:48,160
Doesn't that feel like the perfect
thing to eat after training?

1169
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,480
You ever take a rib bone
and just like just go.

1170
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,990
Just to feel like an animal.
I do that with chicken bones.

1171
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:00,160
Bite off the ends and suck the
marrow out of them. Oh Man.

1172
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:03,310
I love your caveman status. I can't
help it. My mom always did it and my,

1173
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,310
I grew up with savages, bro. Yeah.

1174
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:10,540
Your mom was picking fleas off the
back of these. She's half Orangutang.

1175
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,100
Beautiful, beautiful woman, but brokers,

1176
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:18,310
very shameful that you're swinging
down from the term [inaudible] house.

1177
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,530
My mom used to bite the bottoms off
chicken bones and suck the marrow out.

1178
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:28,520
Tell me that sad, some crazy monkey
shit. You know, whatever bro.

1179
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:32,860
Figure that out. You know, we've figured
that out. That's some old world shit.

1180
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,640
You know, people stop sucking
marijuana two generations ago,

1181
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,100
if it came with food,

1182
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:42,060
became plentiful enough that we didn't
have to suck the marrow out of the bone.

1183
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,540
That funny. That's awesome. Do you ever,

1184
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:48,970
you guys ever roll with the kid for him?
I Jerry Maguire.

1185
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,940
You remember that little kid,
but I had glasses.

1186
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:56,320
What do you mean do ecstasy with them?
Does Jujitsu and he,

1187
01:06:56,321 --> 01:07:00,100
I choked out Heifer on like five times
in a row and he was talking about on his

1188
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:03,220
podcast, how I shamed you wise because
there was a little kid from Jerry Maguire.

1189
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,540
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1190
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:07,360
I didn't know how friends doing
Jiu Jitsu on a regular basis.

1191
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,200
Guess he does it here in there.
Sean Heffron comic,

1192
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,750
he won last comic standing.
He's a good buddy of ours.

1193
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,890
I did a whole tour with him.

1194
01:07:14,891 --> 01:07:17,810
Him and Charlie Murphy lowers the
travel across the country years ago.

1195
01:07:17,811 --> 01:07:21,100
I'll look at that. Yeah, we
did a bud light comedy tour.

1196
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:26,290
I could remember that guy's name
so hard. Well, what's he look like?

1197
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:30,290
Heffron and some white guy.
White Guy. Very clean cut.

1198
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:36,040
Very, very funny. Standup comic and a good
dude to party. Yeah, he's a great guy.

1199
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:37,030
But uh,

1200
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:40,900
he likes to go to fucking karate classes
and shit and take new and different

1201
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:44,260
things. You just started wrestling
and does judo and cool. He's cool.

1202
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:48,040
It gets into shit. You know, he's
one of those uh, like real obsessive.

1203
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,960
Like one of those guys,
he gets onto something,

1204
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:51,640
it just becomes absolutely
obsessed with it.

1205
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,160
For Awhile it was like
that Tony Robbins Shit,

1206
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:57,640
neuro linguistic programming and he
used to like have a little fucking hand

1207
01:07:57,641 --> 01:07:58,070
movements.

1208
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:01,000
We going before I went on stage and like
it would do a certain thing with his

1209
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:04,600
hand and that would lock him into the
mindset of him killing when he's on stage

1210
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:07,810
and then he could take it, just
go with it onstage. That's cool.

1211
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,820
Amway PR kind of guy.
You believe in that shit.

1212
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:14,920
You've got a lot of interesting
thoughts about motivation and yeah,

1213
01:08:14,921 --> 01:08:15,980
I all that

1214
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,890
stuff came from um, Milton
Erickson. You know who he is,

1215
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:21,830
know the father of modern hypnosis.

1216
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,020
He's really super interesting,

1217
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:28,070
amazing guy who there was one guy
who figured out hypnosis, read, read.

1218
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,140
There's three books called
conversations with Milton.

1219
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:33,470
Erickson were giant gringer I think his
names, they come up with it. What year?

1220
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,150
Okay. He would be long
passed away no matter what.

1221
01:08:37,151 --> 01:08:39,290
What year do you think
they invented hypnosis?

1222
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:44,840
I think versions of it could go on for
someone just kind of put this together.

1223
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:48,440
Okay, so this guy didn't invent
hypnosis. He just says modern.

1224
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,570
I think of what people would
know is modern hypnosis.

1225
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:53,330
A lot of it came from Milton
Erickson and he would kind of hit me,

1226
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:57,020
tie this whole groups of people.
Really super interesting guy.

1227
01:08:57,021 --> 01:09:00,980
And he was in a wheelchair too? Yes.
You guys got hypnotized before. Wait,

1228
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:02,960
you're talking to this guy
who's a professor at Xavier.

1229
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,930
He like in a wheelchair
during this maneuver. Yeah.

1230
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,450
That's bad ass like some damn it is.

1231
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:12,860
That NLP stuff came from a lot of
what Milton Erickson was doing.

1232
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,060
So he figured out how to,

1233
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,050
he was the first guy to figure out
how to hypnotize large groups. Oh,

1234
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:22,670
he would do that just by the way he's
his, the patterns he used to speak. Right,

1235
01:09:22,671 --> 01:09:25,460
but did other people just by the pattern,
just so he would go onstage,

1236
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,520
he would speak in a certain pattern and
the whole audience would be hypnotized.

1237
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:31,100
Yeah. And then then they, then
he'll cut of drop things into,

1238
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:34,180
he's a really interesting guy. So would
you be hitting it was everybody hit mid?

1239
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:37,330
Does. Who knows if it was
everybody, but that was, yeah,

1240
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,330
I remember one guy sent to me,
when you're on stage,

1241
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:45,030
you got to hypnotize the audience
and I've seen you do it. Well you,

1242
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,660
what you do is, I wouldn't say
hypnotized. What I say is you,

1243
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:53,670
you get them with your focus and your
intent and with the economy of words so

1244
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:54,561
that you don't,

1245
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:57,770
they don't have to work too hard and know
exactly what you're saying. You, you,

1246
01:09:57,771 --> 01:10:00,470
you put g project what you're
thinking into their head.

1247
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,890
And then it's like you operate their mind,

1248
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:08,270
they'll allow you inside their mind
to take them on a journey. Yeah.

1249
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,880
I wouldn't say it's hypnotizing,
but it is a connection. Right.

1250
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,870
There was an undeniable connection that
you have with the crowd. As a comic.

1251
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:21,350
If you, you feel it, you lock into it
and you ride it and you have to ride.

1252
01:10:21,351 --> 01:10:24,800
It was like super honesty.
It's like it's a weird thing if you,

1253
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,650
if you're not really in the moment it'll,
it'll stop,

1254
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,650
it'll stop and then they'll just become
words and you lose this connection.

1255
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,510
That's what like Craig report,

1256
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:35,210
all those things go a long way to
keeping that connection going. Yeah.

1257
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:39,320
So this guy just stands or sat there in
the wheelchair and would talk and the

1258
01:10:39,321 --> 01:10:43,410
audience would walk out. I would
imagine you have very similar, not like,

1259
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:46,320
like this some up in here.
Make out with the person.

1260
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:51,570
Don't go common consensus.
Yeah, exactly. As he comes.

1261
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,040
So there, is there any, I mean,

1262
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,820
so you're telling me that people like
I know that people been to the GAM

1263
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:02,330
hypnotizing show and they're
like, yeah, you know,

1264
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:04,220
and maybe she got up and you know,

1265
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,350
barked like a dog every
time he snapped his fingers.

1266
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,650
And you know any truth to that?
I Dunno. That's what I'm saying.

1267
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:10,484
I'm asking you guys,

1268
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:14,190
I've seen a bunch of times really
comedy comedy shows by a bunch

1269
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,680
of different dudes. Yeah, I've seen
it a bunch of times. It's real.

1270
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,390
I just doesn't work on everybody.
But it works.

1271
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:23,110
I think you have to have a weekend
mind or are you not necessarily real?

1272
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,480
I remember,
remember

1273
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,860
this,
what you guys are saying?

1274
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:35,840
I said we were saying that you have to
be a week to get hypnotized to hepatitis

1275
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,670
shows. Not necessarily when
I go. So it's been able to,

1276
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,780
he was at the funny bone and
then it was this out of nowhere

1277
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,900
cause they ever tried to hypnotize,
you know,

1278
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,640
I know that's what I'm trying like I
don't think they could do it. I would try.

1279
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:52,140
It would be like, all
right, cool. Let's try.

1280
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,770
You have to be willing to let yourself
go. Yeah, it's probably, would it be,

1281
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:59,640
I'll be like, fuck that. Yeah,
you're right. You're right.

1282
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,350
I would. I would, you know, you
wouldn't like bark like a dog.

1283
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:04,921
You know what I'm saying?

1284
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:07,950
Like how would you think different
people have different definitions?

1285
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:11,790
First of all, for hypnosis, there's
other people that they would,

1286
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:15,390
they'll describe hypnosis as is just
putting someone in a very relaxed state

1287
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:19,770
where they're receptive to information
and you can talk to them in a more

1288
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:24,210
balanced way. Then you can, when they're
up and hyper at you and looking around.

1289
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:28,140
And so it's the idea of hypnosis.
It's not like they're not conscious.

1290
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:30,000
They are very conscious.
They're conscious and aware.

1291
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:34,830
They're just relaxed into a certain
level of consciousness. It's,

1292
01:12:34,831 --> 01:12:38,550
it's not, it's not standard.
It's relaxed and controlled.

1293
01:12:38,551 --> 01:12:41,970
And that even though they're
aware of everything, there's
still being hypnotized.

1294
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,950
I don't know. I don't, you know,

1295
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,860
I don't know what the
official definition of it is,

1296
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:51,950
but I have seen people that are absolutely
hypnotized and believe that there's

1297
01:12:52,261 --> 01:12:54,840
things that are going on.
And one of those hypnosis comedy shows,

1298
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,990
there's things are going on around them
and they can't control it and they can't

1299
01:12:57,991 --> 01:12:59,940
stop it. And they'd come in
their pants. I've seen them.

1300
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:03,240
There's monsters in the room.
I've seen, I've seen all that.

1301
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:05,760
She absolutely hates it.
There's monsters in the room.

1302
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,630
There was one where the guy with the
was, there was this guy, Frank Santos,

1303
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,590
who had this guy having sex with Madonna
on stage. I'll never forget this.

1304
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:19,190
And the guy's like, and you're inside
of her and you're inside of our,

1305
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:22,730
and the dude just nuts and
his fucking pants. Wait, could

1306
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,210
you see the kid just
nuts like immediately,

1307
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:31,980
like knots in his pants and everyone
starts laughing and howling and then you

1308
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:35,400
know the, the Hypno hypnotists goes,
whoa. I guess. I guess you enjoyed that.

1309
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:37,020
All right. All right. Clean
yourself up over there.

1310
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:40,170
And the kid just walks off
stage and they, the, the, the,

1311
01:13:40,171 --> 01:13:42,870
the people that worked there helped
him and brought him into the bathroom.

1312
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:48,090
He just fucking shot a load in his
pants. He really believes this,

1313
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:52,580
Brian, or within in the backseat
of my Toyota Prius. Yeah.

1314
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,010
I'm not saying it's Michio Kaku
and they're getting hypnotized.

1315
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:59,080
They're probably some knuckleheads,
you know what I'm saying? Is, is like,

1316
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:02,450
what's that guys? This is a plant. No,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I know that.

1317
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,950
I know the hit mentos the him,
and this was a very honest,

1318
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,590
digitally capable of doing it.
Not to everybody.

1319
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,490
He would pick people out of the crowd.
He said, who wants to get him to,

1320
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,040
he'd bring him up on stage and he

1321
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,510
would always know who wasn't really under.

1322
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:15,460
There's some people he goes and
he would tell you, I go, well,

1323
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:18,010
how do you know when they're
not alone? Because I, you
could just tell. I go, well,

1324
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:20,170
what are you doing? He goes, he can't
do it. You can't, can't hypnotize them.

1325
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:23,560
Some people you can't have a
touch. So it's like, there's
almost like some people,

1326
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:27,940
they're programmed in a certain way where
there's just a door open and you can

1327
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:31,940
just open that door and get
inside of newer operating
systems. Yeah. And that was,

1328
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,570
that was passed at two points.
Yeah. That's some old shit.

1329
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:37,990
That's Mac Osx or OSPF eight
whatever the fuck it was.

1330
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,660
I think everyone has a capability
to go there. Really capability.

1331
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:47,840
If you can relax enough to decide that
that's a place that you're going to go to

1332
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,950
your opener. Receptive to it. Of
course. Really everyone. Everyone. Wow.

1333
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:57,040
That's why average. That's things like
advertising works. Does it really work?

1334
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:59,950
I guess it works, right? For
sure, but does it really?

1335
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,490
I think what what works more is the
court of public opinion. You know,

1336
01:15:03,491 --> 01:15:07,720
like things that are desirable
or desirable because a
bunch of people like them,

1337
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:11,790
not just because of advertisement,
you know, it becomes a chicken.

1338
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:15,570
Egg fell was the last time you saw
Ferrari advertisement. You don't see him.

1339
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:19,420
You know why they don't need to do that
because it's a fucking Ferrari. You know

1340
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:24,910
when you hear that [inaudible] good.
Pretty good.

1341
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,240
What are you talking about dude?
They have a Ferrari store in a mall.

1342
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,970
You just never leave that.
You could buy their items.

1343
01:15:30,971 --> 01:15:34,990
They don't add verdant sizing enough.
Not they're selling things, bro.

1344
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:40,900
Capitalize off their image and making
money. They advertise a different way.

1345
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,520
They have a formula one car that's
driven by team Ferrari that's advertised,

1346
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,900
but it's also how they
develop their product.

1347
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:51,240
That's why the advertising
works so congruent with their
product. Right. But the,

1348
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,810
it's sort of a part of their business.

1349
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:56,760
I wouldn't say it's advertising as much
as I would say it's unnecessary time.

1350
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,260
The traditional way I'm putting
an ad in the newspaper. It is,

1351
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:06,040
but what I'm saying is they don't try
to reach outside of their sport and like

1352
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:10,120
make commercials on TV or when was
the last time you saw a commercial for

1353
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:12,610
Ferrari in a magazine? You
know, listen dude, listen,

1354
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,680
think about it is that they don't need to,
they're in such an established name.

1355
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:19,270
They do market and advertise that.
Just do it in different ways.

1356
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,530
And I feel like he did all the advertising
a long time ago and they did all the

1357
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:25,300
advertisement a long time ago.
There've been,

1358
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,020
they'd been such a bad ass me
per sold long that we'd like,

1359
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:34,021
we don't even need to advertise our shit
costs $500,000 and you can't afford it,

1360
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,750
so fuck off. You know, like that's really
there. Well, it's not even just that,

1361
01:16:37,751 --> 01:16:40,360
it's just that they're the best,
you know, it's like, it's, it's,

1362
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:43,480
it's about Lamborghini.
Why not under gene is,

1363
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:47,350
or they're not as good or something about
them. They're just, it's not the same.

1364
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:52,150
It's like Lamborghini. It's like too
trashy too, you know, trying too hard to,

1365
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:53,403
you know what I'm saying?

1366
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:59,620
I Argo especially,
or it's still pretty wicked.

1367
01:16:59,621 --> 01:17:03,040
But if you had to choose between
a Lamborghini and a Ferrari,

1368
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:07,750
like what's a cooler car?
Ferrari's me all day parole. Yeah.

1369
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:10,100
Lab really liked them. Yeah,
because it's like freaking bad

1370
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,190
ass when you're a little kid. You were
like, man, I want a Lamborghini Bro.

1371
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:16,490
And have you had a little toy Lamborghini
and you're like, yeah, look at it.

1372
01:17:16,491 --> 01:17:20,240
It's purple and black. When it's shiny
or then it gets wet and now it's green.

1373
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:24,320
Hyper Color Lambo. That's what I'm
talking about. So Lamborghini was awesome.

1374
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,190
Ferrari was like the old man,
Dork car. When you add a man door,

1375
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:34,820
Jesus buying my like, I have a fuck
James Bond. That wasn't my point.

1376
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:39,470
My point is that I'm just talking
about my matchbox experience, bro.

1377
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:40,520
That's all I'm saying.

1378
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:45,521
Like I just felt like Lamborghini was
really kicking it off and filed circa 1986

1379
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,260
don't get me wrong. We're silly
logo, whatever that's called.

1380
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:52,630
That's a pretty fucking Beasley car.
That's a Ferrari. Oh No. Oh yeah.

1381
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:56,810
Marcy Lago. Marciella. Wait,
there's another one that's
the Lamborghini Mercier.

1382
01:17:56,811 --> 01:18:01,430
Laga was diverse. She a
logo. Yeah. $350,000 car or
something crazy like that. It's

1383
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:06,540
ridiculous. I just remember that shit
looked like back to the future, bro.

1384
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:10,620
Ridiculous. They're like a super
collagen was. Ferrari is like,

1385
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:13,550
I guess not though for I was
pretty ridiculous. Yeah, exactly.

1386
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:18,150
You see a fiery to know top. If this
looks like a weird, crazy boat car. Yeah,

1387
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:18,950
I know.
It's like,

1388
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:21,500
but love that someone's who's dumb
enough to make something like that.

1389
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,790
The dumb enough to make something just,

1390
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:27,830
just fucking completely reckless defies
traffic violations just in first gear.

1391
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,590
This is, you know, it'll pass the
fucking speed limit. It's ridiculous. No,

1392
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,300
I don't got a driver's license
because I had to call on a car.

1393
01:18:36,301 --> 01:18:38,420
It wasn't even that fast.
What happened?

1394
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,860
Not just kept getting tickets and throwing
them out the window. Oh Jane. You know,

1395
01:18:42,861 --> 01:18:45,410
I just was like, I'll pay it
online. I'll pay it online.

1396
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:49,100
But I didn't realize there was points on
this thing. Like there's a point limit.

1397
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,490
I Dunno. I just got that for parking.
You hit the limit and they shut you off.

1398
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,340
Yeah, they were like nop. Sorry.
Parking's not that. Right.

1399
01:18:55,341 --> 01:18:58,280
Like parking has no points and I
have a bunch of parking tickets too.

1400
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,230
I paid them all off though.
I'm a legit,

1401
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:04,160
cause I have a parking ticket
that I don't, can't find
like no, you were speeding.

1402
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:08,900
Yeah a bunch of times. Yeah. And you know,
they just catch you in weird spots like,

1403
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:12,710
like on the way to training and it's just
a back road. There's no school on it.

1404
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:17,150
Or have you ever considered getting
like a real like luxury style car where

1405
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:20,180
you're like a Cadillac or something like
that where you would just drive slow,

1406
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:23,750
like one of those big ass Cadillacs?
Yeah, I'm thinking, I mean,

1407
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:27,620
I know it's like people driving me around,
so glad I lost. Yeah. Like whatever,

1408
01:19:27,621 --> 01:19:32,420
just drive me. It's like a
taxed. Just drive me somewhere.
I everybody, I got sarge,

1409
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:36,140
but he went from driving damn land
cruisers on the dam. Afghanistan,

1410
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,220
Afghanistan front. Nah, he just drives
me around. I'm like, come on sarge.

1411
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,440
Like he was over there and
the sergeants like my homie,

1412
01:19:42,441 --> 01:19:46,530
he's like a real close friend of mine and
uh, uh, he got blown up by a rocket man,

1413
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:48,960
Afghanistan, but Nah,
he's good. He's like,

1414
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:51,470
it didn't blow all the way
up and hit his head rest.

1415
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:56,060
He hit his head rest and blasted them
and I just cut into his back and stuff.

1416
01:19:56,061 --> 01:19:59,090
He called me up like,
Yo, Bro, I'm coming home.

1417
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:03,890
I forgot to hit by a rocket. I'm like,
for real? I'm like, man, come back dude.

1418
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:06,950
All right, I'll see you. Sooni that all
right, man. He called back two weeks.

1419
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:11,430
I was like, Nah, I'm good bro.
Fuck that. I've killed all
these guys. I'm like, oh my,

1420
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:16,320
like, all right, what can you say to
that? Right. Uh, I understand. Uh,

1421
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,460
fucking go for it. Like, Yo, but
he made it back, dude. And I,

1422
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,080
and we went and visited.
What was this about?

1423
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,870
What the fuck did this conversation get
started? Fine. I don't care. I, I did.

1424
01:20:24,871 --> 01:20:28,860
Now I'm talking about it, so I'm
excited. It's not, oh, oh, because sarge

1425
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,730
sarge get into this for driving you
around. Oh, hey. Drive me around. Yeah,

1426
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:37,760
that's the whole point I was making
anyway, but yeah, but, but I'm saying he,

1427
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,270
that's the craziest story, Dude. And
that's what's happening to kids in a,

1428
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:47,250
you know, kids like this guy was like
23 years old. Like, I'm like, Damn Dude.

1429
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:51,540
Like he's been through enough adventure
for a man three times his age,

1430
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,900
you know, already. I didn't
mean to get it, y'all.

1431
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:57,810
I just got me started cranking
about sarge. Sorry guys.

1432
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:03,480
You him being kicked out
of more commentary by Jason
May, Him Miller. No, I know,

1433
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:05,600
but I'm just thinking cause
you know I could've done it.

1434
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:10,610
I joined up real easy because my old man
was any and like I grew up in the army,

1435
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:12,120
you know,
so so I like,

1436
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:15,910
I feel like real connection to to the
dude's and army and I'm like that we're in

1437
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,330
in the marines and air force,
whatever. I'm just like,

1438
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:22,200
I see how you've got to live to be in
that you should be able to do whatever the

1439
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:23,640
fuck you want to do in this life.

1440
01:21:23,641 --> 01:21:28,410
But it is kind of weird when you see
those crazy video game commercials about

1441
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:33,090
joining the Marines. But why when you
go wow, that's like really shit up.

1442
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:37,680
Or the video games that they make,
that's like call of duty but they make it,

1443
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,970
they have an army gain really game day.

1444
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:45,180
What is his call of duty based in the
present time or is it a call of duty is

1445
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:48,160
awesome. It's going to be cranking
on, I don't know anything about it.

1446
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,890
Some of them are road warriors.

1447
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,940
One something like a roid Tucson's
Vietnam of the latest ones.

1448
01:21:53,941 --> 01:21:57,240
Our modern warfare might feel
like you're in a real war.

1449
01:21:57,241 --> 01:21:59,460
Who plays in that shit is Bruce buffer.

1450
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:03,510
We were in England and this
dude was in his laptop,

1451
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:08,580
his laptop on with fucking crazy eyes
really online jack and people looking

1452
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:11,160
through windows and throwing
grenades and shit. I was like,

1453
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:14,640
what is that call of duty?
It's ridiculous.

1454
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:17,480
It's the graphics and
everything, but man, I,

1455
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:21,000
you see people how fucking tuned in.

1456
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,560
They get to these game course video
games that hardcore for a long time.

1457
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:29,250
But my point is when is the next
level of immersion gonna Come?

1458
01:22:29,251 --> 01:22:30,150
Cause you know it's gonna.

1459
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:32,810
They're gonna figure out some
fucking anywhere already.

1460
01:22:32,811 --> 01:22:35,730
Did they have those rappin led goggles?

1461
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:39,300
You're going to be able to
look down and see your feet.

1462
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:42,300
You're going to be able to look around.
You're going to be in that fucking world,

1463
01:22:42,301 --> 01:22:45,480
man, that's around the
corner. That's a decade away.

1464
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:47,250
They're going to figure out some fucking,

1465
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:50,340
some virtual reality shed
because when we were a kids,

1466
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,920
virtual reality was what they
kept talking about. It's coming,

1467
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,610
wait until virtual reality. But
then when it came, it was like this,

1468
01:22:55,630 --> 01:23:00,630
just like goggles and it looks
whack. Yeah, but technology
is advancing now. Yeah,

1469
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:04,560
exactly. They stepped up their dick
like they don't like running so fast.

1470
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:05,660
I stepped on their Dick like

1471
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,580
now it's the shits common and have
to figure out how you move around.

1472
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:12,130
How would you move? You know,
because you'd want to move.

1473
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:14,750
Your body can't move your body
and let's we should sensors.

1474
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:18,040
Could do is have people
in giant warehouses,

1475
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,960
hollow deck them.
Give them the virtual reality experience.

1476
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,320
You'd put the fucking helmet on them
and set them in the center of a giant

1477
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:29,140
warehouse and the warehouse
as they walked around.

1478
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:32,320
When you never watched star trek, Bro,
you never want to star trek before.

1479
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:35,950
Different than the Holodeck. The
holodeck, the Holodeck. You're like,

1480
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:37,930
I'm going up to the Holodeck it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1481
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:42,100
Are you saying star trek as
in the next generation? Of
course. Come on. Then worse.

1482
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:46,200
I didn't wash that fuck. Out of respect,
out of respect to get the Kirk, whatever.

1483
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:50,620
I was a great show. You're missing.
I was too young for that shit. Okay,

1484
01:23:50,621 --> 01:23:53,830
so spect. That was by
version. Okay. And I'll care.

1485
01:23:53,831 --> 01:23:58,190
Broker wharf is a bad motherfucker.
Okay. I'll just tell you right now data.

1486
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,840
He was awesome. He's super
smart. Sometimes he had
emotions, sometimes he didn't,

1487
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:05,800
you know. And you know, after like star
Trek, the next generation gets overlooked.

1488
01:24:05,801 --> 01:24:10,660
I can't do it. Satta yeah, they
should have Scotty. Scotty again.

1489
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:13,270
He was like 900 years old.
Had a mustache.

1490
01:24:13,271 --> 01:24:18,250
A funny fucking boys head was gigantic
and watermelon. Like no need for that.

1491
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:21,040
Do you see the Michael
Jackson death photo? Oh Wow.

1492
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,430
What they believe is Michael
Jackson's death. Well,

1493
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:27,240
I mean they did had in court
that was the courtroom pitcher.

1494
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:31,180
But is it really because it's on Kinsey
and that's happening. They got it from,

1495
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:31,690
they said,

1496
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:36,430
well someone was in court and the
prosecutors were showing it to show that

1497
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:41,750
because I think the opening statements
broadcast live on TMZ right now. Whoa.

1498
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:44,470
Can you stream? Actually it
hasn't. How crazy is that?

1499
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:49,090
He is a legitimate news source
in a fucking courthouse. Well,

1500
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,990
Michael Jackson's, it's just public.
I think it's open to talk about,

1501
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,140
that's the perfect place to put that.
There it is.

1502
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:59,170
It's like that's the celebrity
worship Shit, you know? That's weird.

1503
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:03,490
This Michael Jackson Dr Thing. It's
kind of funny man. Yeah. What happened?

1504
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:06,550
I don't even know what happened.
Did he killed the guy or was was,

1505
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,110
I just can't wait for the,
the def photo music video that were,

1506
01:25:10,111 --> 01:25:13,180
they used that photo to do music,
you know, Shit like that. It's coming

1507
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,870
and I did

1508
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,730
both of you guys get a fucking real
stop.

1509
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:28,900
Hey Joe Rogan.

1510
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:35,180
So loud is a radio show.
He's supposed to be like, no,

1511
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,780
this is not a radio show.
This is a conversation amongst friends.

1512
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:41,350
Why you talking to me in a way you
would never talk to him on the Internet.

1513
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,420
You wouldn't be doing this

1514
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:50,020
smelly took it to another level
because when the internet,

1515
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:53,140
you took it to another level.
You Ain't help me.

1516
01:25:53,141 --> 01:25:57,440
Do I not fucking flip out like that
on a normal basis, I can't help it.

1517
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:02,890
Do you think, why do you think I go to a
gym everyday guys? Because that's your,

1518
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,850
that's my job.
But guess what?

1519
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,400
It stopped me from having
jobs where I had to be normal.

1520
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:09,080
I can run around on the mat and go,

1521
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:13,090
fuck the shit out of me sometimes.
So,

1522
01:26:13,091 --> 01:26:17,840
so I'm just saying I picked that path
to your medication. Your, there you go.

1523
01:26:17,841 --> 01:26:21,440
So I would just want to yell some time
clip ons, I think to my wiener dog, Bro.

1524
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:26,470
Do you monster fuck bitches stewed.
He's gone to, it's up to him.

1525
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:29,340
Why do you want to watch me? No,
I mean I can just imagine you

1526
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:34,730
make a left turn thing two. Neither
admit to or even acknowledge. I know.

1527
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,660
Why is he, what do you want
it? You want to watch of that?

1528
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:40,140
And then you want to wrestle

1529
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,640
in the corner crying.
What? You fucking some girl

1530
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:53,810
weeping as it comes to just dribbles
on his foot. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,

1531
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,660
whoa.
Oh my God.

1532
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:05,090
Hey Gavin, drinks of coffee guys. What
do you think? That's a good idea for sure

1533
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:10,810
need in your life? Um, when you,
um, when you, uh, start, uh, uh,

1534
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,970
training for your training for you.
December 3rd fight already,

1535
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,250
but you have to wash it like coffee. Do
you, do you limit that for you? Not now.

1536
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:21,620
Coffee, not so much, but man,
I stopped chewing tobacco.
Man. It was making me angry.

1537
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:24,950
I like, I have to stop now. I just
stopped. You were doing it in Colorado,

1538
01:27:24,951 --> 01:27:27,100
were you in when we were up there
and you stay it? I just quit. Yeah.

1539
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:28,730
I was like man, you know
what? This is stupid.

1540
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:31,130
My doctor coffees that he's got to stop
that. I was like, all right, I'll stop.

1541
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:36,330
It's not even that hard. It's just you
get the coffee. I stopped drinking coffee,

1542
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,260
it's fine.
But I stopped.

1543
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:42,070
I stopped in coffee before
I had a headache after
three days, man. That right.

1544
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,060
And then,
but uh,

1545
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,550
but this thing is just a man I want
to choose and then I'm going to not,

1546
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:48,530
I don't know. I don't know.
I know. And then that's it.

1547
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,100
There's no like pain or anything. What is
it you do for you? It does it like hey,

1548
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:53,860
time's up your brain.
That's for sure. Yeah.

1549
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:57,070
That's why I could see why
people smoke cigarettes. Cause I,

1550
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,720
you know the nicotine is kind of like uh,
the same,

1551
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:02,510
same concept that neuro Noah
tropic, right. You want to,

1552
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,900
your brain comes alive a little
bit and you've kept focused down.

1553
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,370
But I don't know man.
No

1554
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:12,830
nicotine in general has that sort of a
to me, to me it's more of like a calming,

1555
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:14,900
relaxing,
but it's in more of a check.

1556
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,550
Like he's right and they can
kind of gives you a check.

1557
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:21,380
Kevin James loves cigars and
smoke cigars together. You know,

1558
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,950
it's one of the rare times I smuggled.
But you get high off of those things.

1559
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:29,270
You Do, you get some weird buzz off
a good cigar for sure. It's nice.

1560
01:28:29,271 --> 01:28:33,650
It's nicotine is a drug nicotine
but I don't get addicted.

1561
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,120
I don't like need it the next day.

1562
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:39,650
When you started the chipper takes a
long time to get addicted though. Yeah.

1563
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:43,890
And it's a different type of
high anyway. Yes. Smoking is,

1564
01:28:43,891 --> 01:28:47,480
the guard is like intense burning in
your mouth and you feel the nicotine like

1565
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:51,110
quick burn that but doing
that God dip or whatever.

1566
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:55,490
Like it's like more like a constant thing.
You know what I mean? Like a constant,

1567
01:28:55,491 --> 01:28:58,130
not that intense or constant,
you know,

1568
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:00,640
so I can see why people get addicted
to and whatever. But you know,

1569
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:01,980
now upon my memory,
I

1570
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,730
thought it was like 18 months or two,
three years to get addicted to cigarettes,

1571
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,210
no route 18 miles.

1572
01:29:07,211 --> 01:29:11,070
It takes 18 months to get a real physical
addiction because I don't know how to

1573
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:13,500
help them remember that Ryan would
be able to tell you about it.

1574
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,640
That's what that's about,
right?

1575
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:18,120
I mean I think like the first c I'm
fortunate I started when I was 15 and I

1576
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:21,180
think the first couple of years it was
more of just like I was smoking because I

1577
01:29:21,181 --> 01:29:24,150
was in high school and me and my friend
would go to his house during lunch break

1578
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:27,390
and just smoke cigarettes. But it wasn't
like I needed to smoke cigarettes,

1579
01:29:27,391 --> 01:29:30,670
but it was kind of like we just did it
cause we were in high school. Surprise.

1580
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:34,320
I thought what happened real quick, but
it doesn't. Oh that's crazy. Well good.

1581
01:29:34,321 --> 01:29:36,570
I I missed the window.
I did that for a little while.

1582
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,220
We still have that time
when I was in high school,

1583
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,950
the baddest kid on the wrestling
team smoked cigarettes.

1584
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:45,610
Just try to kid mark calling.
He was sick wrestler it's fucking wiring

1585
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:51,060
and just run forever. Who
smokes cigarettes? Just
rotten 12 miles. I'm like,

1586
01:29:51,061 --> 01:29:54,090
what the Hell is fucking cigarettes?
We worked out in the basement,

1587
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,940
that's where the, the wrestling room
was all fucking as best as in there.

1588
01:29:56,941 --> 01:30:00,390
But he's probably out of that shit.

1589
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,940
All the insulation was all it's,
you know,

1590
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:06,900
1981 or whatever the fuck it was and
mark would wrestle and then he would go

1591
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:10,650
outside and smoke a cigarette and the
snow standing there and it's fucking a

1592
01:30:10,651 --> 01:30:13,920
wrestling all sweaty and shit. Smoking
a cigarette. His girlfriend, this snow.

1593
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:16,160
I was like,
what a crazy asshole.

1594
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:19,590
But he was just such a wild
mother fucker when he wrestled.

1595
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:23,440
That kid could have been, he could have
been a legit killer wrestler, but just,

1596
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:26,640
you know, everybody's met guys like
that where they just, you know,

1597
01:30:26,641 --> 01:30:30,810
they just have a few vices that they
can never let go and get a taste for it.

1598
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:34,320
I want to hang out in the snow and they
take it to a high level but they can't

1599
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:38,270
keep going. They get to a real high level
and they just sort of like flat line,

1600
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,340
you know, they don't keep
continuing and that upward path,

1601
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:46,290
that's the most difficult dance is to
maintain your balance to the entire

1602
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:48,180
progression. You know, as a, as a fighter,

1603
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:53,181
it's probably not and did not as a
fighter through life [inaudible] life for

1604
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:55,164
sure.
You know,

1605
01:30:55,460 --> 01:31:00,460
it's this excelerate this accelerated
view of what happens in life and anything

1606
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:03,720
like anything that does it very,
very difficult.

1607
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,150
I would think about
that as like fights as,

1608
01:31:06,151 --> 01:31:10,110
as poetry for the actual act of
living life. You know what I mean?

1609
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:13,200
If you look at each individual
fight, they, it has a story.

1610
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:17,010
If you break it down frame by frame,
you know, and you do your job.

1611
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:18,570
If you really think about it,

1612
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:22,140
like a lot of it is are we get so
used to it and desensitized to it,

1613
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:25,020
but every bite has like
a little story in it.

1614
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,720
You know that that's what makes
the big smarter. The Lord.

1615
01:31:27,721 --> 01:31:31,080
Like really interesting to me. Like,
like, because everything you do,

1616
01:31:31,081 --> 01:31:36,081
your life to play can play out in just
this exact particular way as a fight.

1617
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:37,040
You know what I mean?

1618
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:41,160
Like they mirror each other and shit
can happen and should happen. Do you,

1619
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:44,820
do you look at your career like your, your
future ahead and saying, you know, hey,

1620
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,700
you know, this is when I'm going
to get out. I have, you know,

1621
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:52,730
x amount of years before shit starts to
get slippery and then we'll talk about

1622
01:31:52,981 --> 01:31:56,790
this before. Like, I feel like, yeah, you
know, at some point your body goes like,

1623
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:59,920
you gotta go okay. And look at
it from, you know, I don't know.

1624
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:03,460
You have to take that as a fighter.
You have to take that from every angle,

1625
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:06,720
you know what I mean? And, uh, see what's
best for you. You know, there's guys that,

1626
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:09,610
you know, plenty guts, nobody goes
out on top, you know what I mean?

1627
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:13,760
You got Pornstar career coming up. You
have to, you know there's some guys,

1628
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,620
I don't know.

1629
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:18,550
It's just what can you do in the time
that you have to do with it and if not

1630
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:22,900
fucking know. You know? What are we
trying to, you map it out. Mary Bridge.

1631
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:27,520
Do you write down like the things that
you want to do? Yeah, I, yeah, I do. Yeah.

1632
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:30,540
This is getting kind of weird. I
feel personal. It feels personal.

1633
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,170
It's personal for me too.

1634
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:35,190
I've come over to my house and I have my
like motivation things on the wall and

1635
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:39,940
I get fucking embarrassed because
people read them. I know a clown or you.

1636
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:44,550
Yeah, exactly. One of them was super
embarrassing singles fucking chicken. One,

1637
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,230
I want to get my asshole bleach in.

1638
01:32:47,231 --> 01:32:50,890
My little things that I wrote down is
be someone that you would be envious of.

1639
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:56,140
My God, what did I do? She fucking
thing too. It's a good idea.

1640
01:32:56,141 --> 01:33:00,670
It just good life by that. It is good, but
you have to, most people don't do this,

1641
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:04,240
but you have to set out to become an
interesting person because no one's born

1642
01:33:04,241 --> 01:33:07,340
that way. You have to do
things in your life to make.

1643
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,270
I think there are people that
are absolutely interesting
without even trying,

1644
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:11,201
you know? They just, just,

1645
01:33:11,201 --> 01:33:13,840
just think a certain way and they have
certain interests and certain desires.

1646
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:18,790
I don't think you have to
set out somewhere. They start
venturing down that trail,

1647
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:22,700
dig AWS just because that's what the
w what fascinated them. You know?

1648
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,690
But then you guys are chicken and egg
right now. You guys always do that.

1649
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:28,020
That's pretty interesting.
But if he can't,

1650
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:31,320
I think wild statements like
no one ever blank. You know?

1651
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,700
For sure someone can be
interesting without trying.

1652
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:37,210
I know a lot of people that are just
probably autistic and it just genius.

1653
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:39,960
It's an absolutely fascinating and
they're not trying at all. You know?

1654
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:43,060
I know like video game coders. Do you
ever talk to like one of those head guys?

1655
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:46,300
One of those fucking, some guys just
hit the lottery and are interesting.

1656
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:48,400
Naturally. He bullied. Just fascinating.

1657
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,320
They're just fascinating
people without trying at all.

1658
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:53,930
I feel like everybody got a story.
Everybody. Some people have no story.

1659
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:57,940
Some people got shit dig hole than die.
Well,

1660
01:33:57,941 --> 01:34:00,460
that's a story in itself and there
could be some beauty in there.

1661
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:03,040
Sort of one of those little stories.
That's a coming of age story.

1662
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,500
It's a coming of age
and a Jack in the box.

1663
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:07,450
Remember you get a little story
book and the Jack in the box.

1664
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:10,720
That's that guy's life.
I couldn't afford Jack in the box.

1665
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:14,590
You couldn't afford a jacket, not
jacket. I live this a cracker.

1666
01:34:14,591 --> 01:34:18,910
Donald's like,
what's a whole different thing?

1667
01:34:19,810 --> 01:34:21,250
The little toys that you got,
and I said,

1668
01:34:21,251 --> 01:34:25,100
Jack in the box to the crack and they
have the little tattoos. I'm like,

1669
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,910
you know what I mean, but
whatever. You know what it was.

1670
01:34:27,911 --> 01:34:31,000
You were talking about how delicious
checking the boxes. I totally

1671
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:36,130
out of kickbox and if you
don't master Todd again, sure.

1672
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:38,370
That guy is an interesting,
interesting Carrie.

1673
01:34:38,371 --> 01:34:40,630
You would tell me when we were at that,
a professional lawyer,

1674
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:46,000
all the pads for me and I'm like, alright,
mean. He's like, no, no, no. Look,

1675
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:50,590
the pods don't look at the pads pads.
I'm like,

1676
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:55,450
okay, I won't look at the pact.
Oh look, my eyes, my eyes,

1677
01:34:55,710 --> 01:35:00,410
he both ties to my eyes, my
eyes. That's what he'd say.

1678
01:35:00,411 --> 01:35:03,940
What you hid paths with them then? I
had a look of it. The ice, you know ty,

1679
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:05,360
you try not the lab.
Yes.

1680
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,030
Edd.

1681
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:13,620
Explain that for people that don't know,
that's fucking to why crew,

1682
01:35:13,650 --> 01:35:16,770
you have to do this dance before you go
into the ring and he wanted to do the

1683
01:35:16,771 --> 01:35:18,750
dance and it's like, you
know, I mean it's cool,

1684
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:21,550
but explain the music while the
fights going on. In this case,

1685
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:25,830
three minute rounds. Okay. The
whole time it's like, it's like uh,

1686
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:30,370
the cafe scene from star wars music.
Sure. It's very weird interest.

1687
01:35:30,371 --> 01:35:32,570
The big a girl dancing with blue hair.

1688
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:36,110
I mean blue like tubes coming out of
her head. We could, we could play.

1689
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:40,560
What is the real you? Yeah. What is
it called? Put a why crew with w y u.

1690
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:44,370
K are you U or a why crew?

1691
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:45,900
Why crew type music?

1692
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:50,580
You can put what type music American
because Sarge sarge before we battle that

1693
01:35:50,581 --> 01:35:53,830
call of duty. Yeah. He puts the
point time music and it does the dam.

1694
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:58,110
That's the wide crew. No joke, Bryan.
He's like, God does the little dance,

1695
01:35:58,111 --> 01:36:00,240
but I'm going to kill you. I'm
like, really? Did where are you?

1696
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:03,140
He does have a free train.
No, but yeah, no, no, no, no.

1697
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:07,050
I'm fucking douchebag guys.
Got a fucking,

1698
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:13,070
where are you training?
Who are you training with?
Martyna. [inaudible]. Cordero.

1699
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:17,250
Yeah. No Dora. Yeah, what an honor that
is, Huh? Yeah. Training with the manager.

1700
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:20,710
Fucking shoot the bucks if we have
a crazy team right now. So people,

1701
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,410
when people don't know is this sound when
you're watching Moitai they, this is,

1702
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:29,240
this is played through the entire fight.
It's fucking awesome. Exactly the song.

1703
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:32,330
But he had a tape. He had a
tape, not a bug of the CD.

1704
01:36:32,331 --> 01:36:37,331
A tape of this music playing three minutes
and then in the middle of the rounds,

1705
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:42,080
you know the one minute rest period was,
wow,

1706
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,490
I like that. How are you doing? Put that
music on it a little bit in the boat.

1707
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:51,050
Put on his dope. I want to dance. I
used to not like it when I was younger.

1708
01:36:51,051 --> 01:36:53,150
I was still like, this is gross. Why
don't they have to play this music?

1709
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,660
But now as I've gotten older and
embraced differences and cultures,

1710
01:36:56,661 --> 01:36:59,420
I find it fascinating. I love
the dance like this. I like it.

1711
01:36:59,421 --> 01:37:02,780
I don't know what that world boy type
thing we saw I think was awesome.

1712
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:05,320
It was awesome. The first
batch I was like, oh,

1713
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:08,690
I'm not used to this now it might a
second match. Third match. I was like,

1714
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:12,080
this is great. Loved it. Yeah. Especially,
you know the grill high level stuff,

1715
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,510
crazy stuff that happened.
The elbow crazy elbows.

1716
01:37:15,511 --> 01:37:17,600
This guy's caught each other
with and stuff like it was great.

1717
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:21,020
We saw a book called POW Promac.
I think that's how you say his name.

1718
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:25,490
We saw him get his 198th win.
Yeah,

1719
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,780
so relaxed. He was like
a vent. Massive road.

1720
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:32,990
He's so good and he's not even 30 or he's
just turning 30 or something like that.

1721
01:37:32,991 --> 01:37:37,670
If I've been pro for 17 you're
God damn right. Mantled homeboy.

1722
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:40,370
He dismantled home boy
and he did it so relaxed.

1723
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:44,180
It was like this guy never had the
chance. It was all technique. Yeah,

1724
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,970
like everything he did, he was always
in the right place. Yeah. It's neat.

1725
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:52,220
Samos kicks. He beat that. He fought that
whole fight with the knees basically.

1726
01:37:52,221 --> 01:37:55,840
Yeah cause he just came out with
like dieting on me every and it

1727
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,290
actually in a second,
a third round,

1728
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:01,610
he started doing that because now he
found that was this point where you hit

1729
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:05,350
away. But he also did a lot of
like outside kicks and and hooks.

1730
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:09,630
It was all landed lack Odey
he kicked that guy's arms.

1731
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,870
Oh yeah. Oh that he was
so relaxed. He's like,

1732
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,900
then when he fight fight you
could see it like he's so chill.

1733
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:19,140
How about in like the fourth round when
he put his hand up and walked away from

1734
01:38:19,141 --> 01:38:22,290
the dude? Yeah, he put his arm
on. Who should I take him now?

1735
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:25,050
Like chained to the audience and like
looks at the audience telling him about

1736
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:29,940
his white crew was awesome shit
to like stop it on the ground.

1737
01:38:29,941 --> 01:38:32,580
Like that really happened was the guy who,
the other guy,

1738
01:38:32,581 --> 01:38:35,850
I believe he's from Canada, I'm
not sure, I don't know Canada,

1739
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:38,210
but that might be wrong.
Wherever we got Africa,

1740
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:42,690
the other guy apparently pushed him at
the Wayans and got in his face and said a

1741
01:38:42,691 --> 01:38:46,080
bunch of crazy shed and so book house
that he was going to punish him and he

1742
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:46,860
told everyone going.

1743
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,800
So he did his why crew like like
pretending was shooting arrows.

1744
01:38:49,801 --> 01:38:52,920
So he's doing his little pre-fight
dances stomps on the game and it's like

1745
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:56,490
shooting arrows at the guy and he got
like in the guys' space like wait too

1746
01:38:56,491 --> 01:38:58,500
close.
Whereas first fist was like,

1747
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,930
like literally inches from
the guys face when he ended.

1748
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,490
So it was really like intense.

1749
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:05,430
And then he went out there and
just dismantled to do slowly.

1750
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:10,340
That guy had some flashes of
greatness hands he can punch.

1751
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,330
It was really good and he came straight
a few times and landed and came with a

1752
01:39:14,331 --> 01:39:17,100
straight and hook combination.
You see the experience of book,

1753
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:20,630
how would fade back when the dude was
attacking that was coming after him and

1754
01:39:20,631 --> 01:39:25,050
punches. He would just fade back and
then needs fade back and the knees,

1755
01:39:25,051 --> 01:39:28,710
time up, Bang needs the body needs
the buddies like flippy knees,

1756
01:39:28,711 --> 01:39:32,310
where's his fucking hip turns and just
digs his knee to the side of your rib

1757
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:35,970
cage and the Torque in the fucking
technique that that guy has, man.

1758
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:37,890
And then he just started
chopping homeboys leg,

1759
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:43,350
you know that weird tie sort of dance.
And they don't watch that though.

1760
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:48,570
It's crazy. With the style kickboxing,
you can get so much more loose.

1761
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:53,150
Been in mixed martial arts. You don't
have to worry about getting taken down.

1762
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:54,930
So it's kind of funny isn't it?

1763
01:39:54,931 --> 01:39:58,920
That like to really see the highest
level of striking. Here's the rules.

1764
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:01,350
Just kicking. Yeah. But you know,

1765
01:40:01,351 --> 01:40:03,900
I mean that makes sense that there's
going to be a hybrid. You know,

1766
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:07,500
we're seeing it now. The hybrid is, is
bound to happen in mixed martial arts.

1767
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,870
Do you think that for a young
fighter who's developing, it's,

1768
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:13,020
it's important to have like just straight
grappling matches and just straight

1769
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:16,170
kickboxing matches, well not
ranked. That helps you at all?

1770
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:18,780
I think it helps a little bit,
but I don't think,

1771
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:21,030
I think you definitely need
to mix up because that's what,

1772
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,250
that's what's happening,
you know?

1773
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:26,340
And the real benefit is learning
how to compete. It takes a long,

1774
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:27,470
just like you'd doing standup,

1775
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:30,570
I'm sure took a long time to
get comfortable or Jason Fight,

1776
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:33,240
whatever it is that you specialize in,
you have to put hours in.

1777
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:36,510
It's tough if you're doing
striking because maybe you're
getting hit in the head

1778
01:40:36,511 --> 01:40:39,270
for hours.
Grappling tends to be easier and that's,

1779
01:40:39,271 --> 01:40:42,780
and if you were competing every day,
it would be so much easier.

1780
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,730
Of course your body wouldn't
be able to withstand it,

1781
01:40:44,731 --> 01:40:48,120
but mentally it would be so much easier
than if you're competing once every six

1782
01:40:48,121 --> 01:40:52,440
to nine months. That becomes like a real
enough to really get you going. Yeah,

1783
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:54,280
well don't,
most fighters

1784
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:57,160
have their best fights when they have a
fight and then a short layoff and then

1785
01:40:57,161 --> 01:40:59,290
another fight.
It's like you barely break camp,

1786
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:01,000
you relax a little bit and then boom,

1787
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,080
you already conditioned did
you don't have that backend.

1788
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:06,460
Being consistent as a fighter is like
one of the most important things.

1789
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:09,790
If he's just like consistently training,
we'd never really fall off.

1790
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:11,530
You get back in the room,

1791
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:15,790
hey your and your work on things and you
actually have a roadmap to go somewhere

1792
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:19,480
at the end of this little special set
of kept like, I lifted weights one time.

1793
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:20,710
Like, all right, this
is what I'm gonna do.

1794
01:41:20,711 --> 01:41:23,560
I'm gonna get stronger during this
part of my camp. You know what I mean?

1795
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:24,910
And then Ryan has me do so.
All right,

1796
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,790
we're going to work exclusively on does
grounded pound. You know what I mean?

1797
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:30,040
Like just focus on that thing,
you know?

1798
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:34,060
It really keeps your mind in tune and
learning new stuff. You know what I mean?

1799
01:41:34,061 --> 01:41:37,120
Like it's not like just
putting in the grind hours.

1800
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:40,990
I remember I'd been with camps before
where you just fight. Just fight. Yeah.

1801
01:41:40,991 --> 01:41:43,900
We talked about this when we were out to
dinner the other night in Colorado and

1802
01:41:43,901 --> 01:41:46,660
Utah. Yeah, yeah. When you
first started training with Dan,

1803
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,190
Dan Henderson just fought every day.

1804
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:55,090
I was like in a high school gym and I was
like, all right, let's fight. Oh, cool.

1805
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:58,480
Yeah. I first, I was nervous to go
turn it down. Like, man, this, I dunno,

1806
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:59,710
this would be stupid man.

1807
01:41:59,711 --> 01:42:04,711
I showed up to the dam wrestling room at
some podunk high school and I was like,

1808
01:42:05,271 --> 01:42:10,090
and he was like, Oh, put yourself
on, we're going to fight. I kinda,

1809
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:13,280
you know, I was like, all right, that's
fine. You said we're going to fight that.

1810
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:17,770
Basically I was, I didn't say we're
going to spar. Uh, you know, and it was,

1811
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:21,690
that was the, didn't matter. Let's
fight. Let's let them call it spark bro.

1812
01:42:21,950 --> 01:42:26,440
And I was so happy at that
time of my life. I was like,
ah, yeah, good. No pressure.

1813
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:30,090
Just fucking know. Like,
uh, like some, uh, some,

1814
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:34,400
some trainer with a big ass
ego. Just, just a dude like,

1815
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:39,010
and another dude fighting and in some
of the guys fighting. Yeah, but did it,

1816
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,860
how'd you guys work on technique?
Drilled a little bit,

1817
01:42:41,861 --> 01:42:43,420
but it was basically like fighting too.

1818
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:48,180
There's never a whole lot that had so
much fun. Let's fight. Let's fight. Yeah.

1819
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:52,600
Yeah. It was just so fun, man. It's got
to be some serious life experience though,

1820
01:42:52,601 --> 01:42:55,720
as far as like for just the
rest of your whole MMA career,

1821
01:42:56,170 --> 01:43:00,220
the amount of rounds you put in with that
fucking savage swinging at you and IGA

1822
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:04,180
bunch. Hardest Shit you got to watch out
for it. His right here. Yeah. Fuck yeah.

1823
01:43:04,181 --> 01:43:06,490
You do.
Right hands ridiculous.

1824
01:43:06,491 --> 01:43:09,940
That upper cut that he cut fade or with
that under upper called that was just

1825
01:43:09,941 --> 01:43:14,560
like, ah Ha. You didn't know that was
coming and it was hard as fuck dude.

1826
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:17,110
That angle it out. It was the
perfect, yeah, that was a perfect,

1827
01:43:17,111 --> 01:43:20,920
perfect placement man. He's just so
confident in that fucking right hand.

1828
01:43:20,921 --> 01:43:24,220
We were talking about this before
we started doing this podcast.

1829
01:43:24,221 --> 01:43:28,750
He's just re re reached some new level man
on a bungalow. Yeah, great bump. Listen,

1830
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:32,560
there's, there's no secrets anymore
here. I'm going to show you.

1831
01:43:32,561 --> 01:43:34,370
I'm going to do and then
I'm going to do it. Yeah.

1832
01:43:34,371 --> 01:43:37,900
You know you got moved to so good
that you, that it works on everybody.

1833
01:43:37,901 --> 01:43:39,880
You're going to do it.
Sure. Yeah. There's guys,

1834
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:42,790
I mean look at Cody Mckenzie and
he's fucking good team. You know,

1835
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:45,460
we might never be able
to beat elite level guys,

1836
01:43:45,461 --> 01:43:47,680
but that guy catches his fucking
arm underneath your chin.

1837
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:50,860
He's put 11 dudes out with
that shit and he catches guys.

1838
01:43:50,861 --> 01:43:54,380
Man got a weird crazy good team where
it goes under it and then he squeezes it

1839
01:43:54,381 --> 01:43:58,700
and turns it up and press is against
it like this and just fucks you up man.

1840
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:00,740
And he's got that shit down laser tight.

1841
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:04,390
It's funny when a guy's got like one
move like that and just just can lock his

1842
01:44:04,391 --> 01:44:05,224
shit up on you.

1843
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:08,570
You know like who some are Paul
Harris and his fucking heel hooks.

1844
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:14,760
You didn't think his heel hooks to
that devastating. You rolling them.

1845
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:19,080
Wrestle with them.
An arm bar rustling.

1846
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:21,980
I thought I was really wary
of that. I was like, Oh,

1847
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:25,350
here comes one of those crazy things and
I jumped off the way. Like I was like,

1848
01:44:25,351 --> 01:44:27,900
I knew real good foot lock stuff.
Yeah. I'm real good at that.

1849
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:29,690
I didn't think about it.
Yeah.

1850
01:44:29,691 --> 01:44:32,450
And I'm flexible so you've got to catch
me just right. You know what I mean?

1851
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:36,480
You can't, it's, it's rough to get is
going after those fucking things. You,

1852
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:38,510
you probably just wouldn't tap.
That would be your problem.

1853
01:44:38,511 --> 01:44:42,830
You'd get ripped apart again. Maybe you
did with chocolate. Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

1854
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:46,700
Jquery. I remember watching that
scrunching up while you were not tapping.

1855
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:50,930
I was watching on TV going, I didn't
even feel any pain. I was like,

1856
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:52,710
what are you doing? I was like, Oh me,

1857
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,170
me tore your ACL would
pop it out right there.

1858
01:44:57,171 --> 01:45:00,200
It was crazy. But you know, I
in the moment you don't care.

1859
01:45:00,201 --> 01:45:04,520
You just like you're do anything
like I, you know, I feel like man,

1860
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:07,400
it'd be no prob like you'll have
to carry me out of there. Like,

1861
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:09,860
I'm not stopping no matter what.
Like no matter what,

1862
01:45:09,861 --> 01:45:13,460
I'm just going to keep fighting and
keep fighting. If you got Tim Sylvia,

1863
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:17,470
what if you like when he fought Frank
Mir and is a forum snapped the owl fight?

1864
01:45:17,471 --> 01:45:21,140
Of course, of course. Really
whatever. Just keep fighting.

1865
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:23,090
I broke my thumb before like and cat it.

1866
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:26,030
Turn it around backwards
and kept fighting. Yeah,

1867
01:45:26,031 --> 01:45:28,220
I smashed my hands and just
keep punching with the fee.

1868
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:31,520
Worry about if something like that Tim
Silvia thing happened and you got kicked

1869
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:32,410
out and again,
that might be,

1870
01:45:32,411 --> 01:45:36,050
or my arm might even have to be answered
at the time. You might not care about.

1871
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:39,260
What do you mean? All you're thinking
about is just when the fight,

1872
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,530
no matter what, he's just picking that
just win the fight no matter what.

1873
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,760
If you catch on fire in the octagon,
just keep fighting until you're nothing.

1874
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:48,020
That's the only way to do so.

1875
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:51,090
We've had these talks before you
made a meal inside turns, right?

1876
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,870
If I'm getting killed in there,
you better throw the towel in.

1877
01:45:54,030 --> 01:45:58,790
But say that it's your responsibility
because I won't, I won't even care.

1878
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:03,800
I'm not going to care. It's your job to
make sure I don't die cause I don't care.

1879
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:07,760
And then I got it CR. If I ended up, if
I end up retard, he's going to kill me.

1880
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,200
Like if I break my neck or something
and I'm like, because like I said, man,

1881
01:46:12,201 --> 01:46:15,620
just come to shoot me to put me in a but
of bullying in my head. Why would you,

1882
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:18,520
what if the shot you and then a week
later they figured out some new jobs.

1883
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,500
I'm not 100% want to be a vegetable bro.

1884
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:24,200
I don't want them to remember me as
maybe just for a week and they'd be

1885
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:27,220
vegetable [inaudible] happened nude.

1886
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,380
Like maybe you'd be a
vegetable for a year.

1887
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:33,080
Would you be willing to be a face to me
for a year if they could figure out like

1888
01:46:33,081 --> 01:46:37,330
look at Jason, I know you're in there,
but one in in one week guaranteed.

1889
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:41,040
How are you going to guarantee, oh,
stem cell research rejuvenation.

1890
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:45,890
They going to just put a needle in
your spine injected with stem cells.

1891
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:51,010
Avatar tree. Yeah, but I would love
that and then I changed my mind.

1892
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:52,063
I changed my mind.

1893
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:56,700
If I can plug my ponytail and be your
butt every come to you I want to do,

1894
01:46:56,701 --> 01:47:00,210
that would be dope. I would say I
would take that. Could you imagine?

1895
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:02,610
You could find out if people are
completely full of Shit or not?

1896
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:04,000
The first time you fucked him,
that would be a man.

1897
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:08,880
That's the Cheetah avatar living.
Yeah, I know. Oh Shit. This hose dirty.

1898
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:11,730
I connected the speech.
You never been to France.

1899
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,930
Crazy lion asshole.

1900
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:23,880
All right man. Let me
sit up. Sit down, buddy.

1901
01:47:24,210 --> 01:47:27,390
I guess got amped right now. Sorry guys.
That's what you do. That's where you are.

1902
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,200
That's why you you, there's nothing wrong
with being crazy and having bursts it.

1903
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:35,820
Just try to manage it. Do your best
and these years are just these,

1904
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:39,240
the way you just ask me, you have these,
my sunglasses or Joe Rogan said yes,

1905
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,470
I'll take that as a compliment
because they're mine. Well,

1906
01:47:43,471 --> 01:47:45,690
I've done it as a compliment that
you would take that as a compliment.

1907
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:50,180
That they look good on
you. Thanks man. Um,

1908
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,600
so anyway, we're, we're
talking about rocket ships. No,

1909
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:55,920
we're talking about you dealing with fame.
How are you dealing with,

1910
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:01,020
it's weird for sure. It was a bully beat
down the big step. The first big step.

1911
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:05,520
Yeah. But now, you know, being
back, damn ultimate fighters status.

1912
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:07,740
Did you feel any different thing man?
Cause uh,

1913
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:11,310
cause the people at the UFC fans are like,
like man,

1914
01:48:11,311 --> 01:48:15,420
they're excited fans all over the,
all over the country. They're excited,

1915
01:48:15,421 --> 01:48:18,510
they're super excited and up in your face.
It's great.

1916
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:22,320
Like it's a whole different realm. But
I've gone to now, so like I'm like,

1917
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:25,800
oh okay cause the bully beatdown people,
there are people who watch TV.

1918
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:29,590
These are people that watch fights.
Right. So there, you know, on, I dunno,

1919
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,380
it's really interesting to see every, and
I love everybody, you know, it's crazy.

1920
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:37,260
And the UFC got me to sign autographs
and stuff and I'm doing that. Um,

1921
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:40,920
what do you call that? A,
the fan expo and Houston.

1922
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:45,920
You doing good to like connect with people
who love mixed martial arts, you know?

1923
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:48,180
And I'm like, I'm like,
yeah, it's cool. You know?

1924
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:51,360
It's definitely a different world
though too, that's for sure. And,

1925
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:54,600
and being famous, you know, there's
was some drama. Well you got,

1926
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:56,280
you got slowly famous though.
Right?

1927
01:48:56,281 --> 01:48:59,520
Did you feel a bump when you started
fighting on CBS when you like when you

1928
01:48:59,521 --> 01:49:02,550
fought Jake shields? There's any bump
from that. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

1929
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:04,690
That was like a million people
watched it and a lot of people,

1930
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:06,090
what is it like a million?

1931
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:09,960
How many people watched that on
CBS with a Bra Bra brawl thing? Oh,

1932
01:49:09,961 --> 01:49:11,280
that thing's been on the Internet.

1933
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:15,150
Everybody knows what that was good for
you in the long run. In the long run,

1934
01:49:15,151 --> 01:49:19,030
it was defeated. Everybody
hates me. I'm like, yeah, but
it wasn't even, I was like,

1935
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,240
you it to be like,
I hadn't tried to be like,

1936
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:22,890
I wish I could have been
in on those meetings.

1937
01:49:22,891 --> 01:49:25,800
I would have straighten those bitches
out right away. I swear to God,

1938
01:49:25,801 --> 01:49:29,490
I would've sat all those fucks coker and
all those dummies down. I don't. I said,

1939
01:49:29,491 --> 01:49:32,250
listen, why the fuck did he get
in the octagon in the first place?

1940
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:34,950
Why are you not on the door?
Why do you have so many people?

1941
01:49:34,951 --> 01:49:36,840
And if you're going to have a guy
come in and talk shit, the other guy,

1942
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:38,880
how about you let the other guy
have his fucking speech first?

1943
01:49:38,881 --> 01:49:41,160
And you did inform him that he's
going to be talking to this other guy

1944
01:49:41,161 --> 01:49:43,770
afterwards. And this is just marketing
and trying to set up a fight,

1945
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,510
but they just didn't
have control of the cage.

1946
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:49,060
And then all of a sudden this one guy
gets jumped by a bunch of fucking wild

1947
01:49:49,061 --> 01:49:54,040
dogs and it's your fault.
This is ridiculous. It's
completely, totally ridiculous.

1948
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:58,390
The most one sided perspective
that they had just chosen.

1949
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,210
Mauro looked at you that that famous
picture that you're talking about,

1950
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:02,710
he's giving you the stink guys.

1951
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:05,480
You walking by with a grin on your face
in front of Gus Johnson while they're

1952
01:50:05,481 --> 01:50:09,700
reapplying is makeup and
you're walking by and the

1953
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:15,570
best picture ever. So it's happened
and explained my whole life bars,

1954
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:19,790
like tighten up a suit, like may
have Miller shame on you. Mayhem.

1955
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:23,920
I who got that picture there? I'll tell
you what, man. I've gotten to know Mauro.

1956
01:50:23,921 --> 01:50:26,950
I like moral Rinaldo. I hung out with
him at the Moitai professionally thing.

1957
01:50:26,951 --> 01:50:31,000
When he was done, he kept talking to me
all, you know, they call me moral water.

1958
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:34,180
That's what they call me.
Marajuana so we're going to get high.

1959
01:50:34,181 --> 01:50:36,460
I'm gonna get high with marijuana
and we're going to have a good time.

1960
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:41,620
I liked that dude though. He grew on me.
Moral Rinell grew on me. That was great.

1961
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:46,300
He's a fungus. The fungus. No,
I liked the guy. He's funny.

1962
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:50,780
He's funny, but he's, he's
always been real cool man. I had,

1963
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:54,850
I had a beef with them a couple of
times and I feel good with them. Well,

1964
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:58,510
you have to be. I had to go, hey dude. And
then he, he responded. I was like, okay,

1965
01:50:58,511 --> 01:51:02,530
I can respect that. I'd see his
perspective and he see my perspective.

1966
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:04,260
He doesn't very,
very broad.

1967
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:07,960
Very rarely does he ever
say anything negative about
fighters. I appreciate that.

1968
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:09,880
I appreciate that because they,
you know,

1969
01:51:09,881 --> 01:51:12,640
there's a lot of people out there that
think that the way to get attention or

1970
01:51:12,641 --> 01:51:13,810
the way to,
you know,

1971
01:51:13,811 --> 01:51:17,670
the way to be snarky is to criticize
fighters and they do it not, you know.

1972
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:24,610
Yeah. I was 60 years old.
Rock kick your ass fires that,

1973
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:28,330
that was the funniest shit ever
be back pedal like the next day.

1974
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:31,390
He didn't need debt back
pulled immediately when
he came down and talked in

1975
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:32,920
front of them.
By the way,

1976
01:51:32,921 --> 01:51:36,370
I don't believe really that if I was 50
years old I could kick his ass and he

1977
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:38,230
was laughing.
I actually respected him for that.

1978
01:51:38,231 --> 01:51:39,850
It was kind of funny because
it was so ridiculous,

1979
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,860
but to come down and ground
and pound and you'd never know.

1980
01:51:41,861 --> 01:51:45,600
Never know what if he was like neo Gracie.
Even at that age, she has a clinch.

1981
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:49,600
He gets the clean and the trip. Now
you were in my world, the ground,

1982
01:51:49,601 --> 01:51:52,990
he's the ocean and I am a shark
and most people cannot swim.

1983
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:56,950
Very merchant back to you.
Imagine if langue, immersion,

1984
01:51:56,951 --> 01:52:01,951
just fucking but just fucking arm drag
them and took us back fucking rear naked

1985
01:52:02,321 --> 01:52:05,830
choke on them for you. I'll just rolled
forward with the hooks in stretches him.

1986
01:52:05,831 --> 01:52:10,680
Now what the fuck goes out?
Both his own jacket and repel heels,

1987
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:14,310
Jacqueline Marcello Garcia
is that bitch can make,

1988
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:15,730
whether it be at one boxing glove,

1989
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:26,640
there's a dude on the underground
that's going to close that.

1990
01:52:28,210 --> 01:52:31,000
Yeah. There's nothing like, you know,

1991
01:52:31,090 --> 01:52:34,270
the underground is awesome
for good and for bad.

1992
01:52:34,271 --> 01:52:39,140
There's a line of fucking assholes
and angry people and insulting people.

1993
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:44,050
But this is a lot of fucking cool people.
That's one of the most unusual sites.

1994
01:52:44,051 --> 01:52:46,160
And I think a big part of,
one of the reasons why it's so cool

1995
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:49,720
is a huge percentage of the people
on that site train. You know,

1996
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,390
on the underground, I would say like
30 or 40 a lot of old school people,

1997
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:55,520
a lot fucking noobs.

1998
01:52:56,570 --> 01:53:00,190
But I remember the submission fighting.co
I remember that too. Yeah. Right.

1999
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:03,320
And it became [inaudible] dot TV and
then it became mixed martial arts to,

2000
01:53:03,321 --> 01:53:05,930
I remember I lost it for a while. Then
it came back. Yeah. I was like, oh,

2001
01:53:05,931 --> 01:53:08,480
this is the, what year did it
start? You got to be on, no man.

2002
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:12,470
I'm starting to like 94
or five I was at AOL.

2003
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:17,420
I was a member back when I was on the
old UFC when I worked for the old UFC,

2004
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:20,390
so that was like 97 or
98 I became a member

2005
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:26,930
because it was back in the day like that
was crazy cause that's a crazy way to

2006
01:53:26,931 --> 01:53:30,140
have a sport like thrive.
You know what I mean?

2007
01:53:30,141 --> 01:53:33,890
They connected on the Internet and back
then those were the dark times that at a

2008
01:53:33,891 --> 01:53:38,870
certain point there was no MMA on TV
at all. It was all a satellite dish.

2009
01:53:38,871 --> 01:53:41,060
That's why I got a satellite dish because
that's the only way you could watch

2010
01:53:41,061 --> 01:53:44,210
the UFC and he can watch the pride.
Then all of a sudden pride was on to it.

2011
01:53:44,211 --> 01:53:45,590
I was like, oh, there's another choice.

2012
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:49,910
Occasionally you'd have some weird fight
that you could buy on pay per view like

2013
01:53:49,911 --> 01:53:53,090
Hicks and Gracie versus Funai or
something like that. It was, you know,

2014
01:53:53,091 --> 01:53:57,860
coliseum MMA. You know, some new Danny
can old thing, but it was old at the time.

2015
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:59,000
This is done well.
There's not many,

2016
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:02,090
there's not many like startup shows
ever again on paper view. Right.

2017
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:03,610
Like the shark fights that's on,

2018
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:07,430
is that paper view or is that each senior
interview? It was, I think it's HD net.

2019
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:10,310
Now the ANC they did a paper view.
They did a pay per view.

2020
01:54:10,311 --> 01:54:13,070
I think it's fucking hard to
sell a pay per view, you know?

2021
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:16,250
I mean did he get a lot of people
knowing about it? That's for sure.

2022
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:19,070
I know fade or had one paper
view that did like miserable,

2023
01:54:19,071 --> 01:54:23,200
like 10,000 fucking buys. I think
pride ever digital? Well either. No.

2024
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:27,140
In the United States I don't think so
because we've got the gardener or a pay

2025
01:54:27,141 --> 01:54:30,530
per view event. No they're not. I mean
if it's nothing, it's just like click,

2026
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:31,200
you know,

2027
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:34,580
you want to garner hype for like a UFC
couldn't do it unless they were tight

2028
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,840
like created to,
you really want to watch this.

2029
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:41,270
I want to pay the $50 the same
thing with boxing the UFC.

2030
01:54:41,271 --> 01:54:46,200
So super smart for putting as much shit
on TV and regular TV as they can versus

2031
01:54:46,201 --> 01:54:51,080
end spike TV and now fox and FX. The
ultimate fighter is going to be on FX now,

2032
01:54:51,081 --> 01:54:55,580
which is going to be fucking huge
fights on Fox or cause on that channel.

2033
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:58,070
Louis. Well, everything's
good. That's a good channel.

2034
01:54:58,071 --> 01:54:59,810
Even though they go all
the way back to the shield,

2035
01:55:00,090 --> 01:55:03,740
you know that was a three or
four shows from that for sure.

2036
01:55:03,741 --> 01:55:07,880
Four different theories on that same
channel. It's weird. Avexis Badass.

2037
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,110
So we're going to have having
the ultimate fighter on Fx,

2038
01:55:10,111 --> 01:55:11,090
they're going to revamp it to,

2039
01:55:11,091 --> 01:55:13,370
they're going to figure out some new
things and they're even going to do some

2040
01:55:13,371 --> 01:55:18,210
live events live on TV, like actual
fights. So it's going to be crazy.

2041
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:21,150
Fighters can be live next year, right?
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Fx.

2042
01:55:22,030 --> 01:55:26,390
I think it's a fantastic idea. Fucking
great idea. It's going to be wicked.

2043
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:29,010
It's going to be a wicked show that we
change the whole experience of it. Yeah,

2044
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:32,840
yeah, yeah, yeah. Well knowing
that a million people are
going to watch it. Yeah.

2045
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,180
Then the pressure's going to be
different and it's going to be creepy.

2046
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:38,720
1 million people watching it live as it
plays off, but in there, what do you hear?

2047
01:55:38,721 --> 01:55:42,920
You hear just 10 people yelling, 20
people yelling. It's awesome. Yeah.

2048
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:44,670
That's going to be,
that's going to be bad ass.

2049
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:48,450
So only the fights will be live and
the rest of the show we'll be like,

2050
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:49,550
what's building up to this day?

2051
01:55:49,570 --> 01:55:52,950
It'd be like 24 seven in that
they claim I'm pretty bad at.

2052
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:53,880
They're going to have a,
you know,

2053
01:55:53,881 --> 01:55:56,220
the storyline will play out
and then you know the people,

2054
01:55:56,221 --> 01:55:58,680
we'll be warming up waiting for
the storyline to end and boom,

2055
01:55:58,681 --> 01:56:02,580
we go right into the fight. Crazy.
Yeah. That's fans who fights?

2056
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:04,830
Is that the question? I
Dunno. That's a good question.

2057
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:08,250
I don't think that's a good idea though.
I like the idea of strategy picking.

2058
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:11,420
You know it's, it's important, you
know, don't you think the show? Yeah.

2059
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:12,770
I feel like dirt,

2060
01:56:12,771 --> 01:56:16,020
my experience in it and people are gonna
Watch it damn on spike, right? Yeah.

2061
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:17,100
Is that,
yeah,

2062
01:56:17,150 --> 01:56:22,150
the bill fight picker and go strategy of
it is a big like cool part of the show.

2063
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:25,230
I think fans should be able to vote what
they think is going to happen. You know,

2064
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:28,380
like vote, who he thinks is going to
win and we got damn it wiped up. Fuck.

2065
01:56:28,381 --> 01:56:31,590
Can't they bet on it.
You know that makes me sick.

2066
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:34,620
Nanny state little bitch ass government.
We have,

2067
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:36,330
you should be able to
bet on that everywhere.

2068
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:38,760
When you go to the God damn corner
and you buy lottery tickets,

2069
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:41,520
you should be able to bet on
Henderson versus shogun. You know,

2070
01:56:41,521 --> 01:56:44,640
I'll take 50 bucks on Henderson, you know,
come on. You should be able to do that.

2071
01:56:44,641 --> 01:56:48,870
And why can't you do that? Why
can't you do that? Texting wrong,

2072
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,390
but from their own impulses and and all
the rest of us who can deal with it.

2073
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:54,970
Oh yeah,
you're a Social Darwin Day.

2074
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:58,890
Fuck you gotta go to fucking Vegas
to place a bet. That's ridiculous.

2075
01:56:58,891 --> 01:57:00,240
I should be able to bet everywhere.

2076
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:03,090
She'd be able to have bedding places as
long as they're legitimate and they pay

2077
01:57:03,091 --> 01:57:07,730
their taxes, you know, Jesus Christ.
But what sports betting Slagle here,

2078
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:10,410
that dump people are just going to blow
all their money being on the street.

2079
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:14,190
There's a lot of that people protest
against any vices pre people protest

2080
01:57:14,191 --> 01:57:17,390
against any, anything that's templating
or that it's tempting. You know, they,

2081
01:57:17,391 --> 01:57:19,320
they protest against trip
clubs for the same reason.

2082
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:22,410
They don't want vice near them.
They want temptation, you know,

2083
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:26,370
for people that can fucking handle it and
enjoy it. It's a real pain in the ass,

2084
01:57:26,371 --> 01:57:27,930
man.
It's a real pain in the ass.

2085
01:57:27,931 --> 01:57:30,960
You can't just bet on fights because
it makes it much more interesting.

2086
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:33,660
Even when you're with your friends, like
if you watch fights with your buddies,

2087
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:36,180
do you ever bet like,
I'll bet fuck off five bucks on this dude.

2088
01:57:36,181 --> 01:57:36,961
Even if you don't even know him,

2089
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:38,940
he will like watching a tough
enough or something like that. Yeah.

2090
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:41,850
I'll take five bucks in the skinny
white dude. Let's do it. You know,

2091
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:45,720
you did make some more
exciting. It does, right? Yes.

2092
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:49,770
Why the fuck isn't that illegal? Uh,
that drives is not, there's a lot of,

2093
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:53,490
there's a lot of dumb people who had
just spent all that money and that you

2094
01:57:53,491 --> 01:57:56,190
could trick the dump people into
giving you all their money. I'm,

2095
01:57:56,630 --> 01:58:01,630
I'm 44 years old and as I get older I
start thinking I am probably going to

2096
01:58:01,801 --> 01:58:05,010
eventually expire and none of
this shit will have changed.

2097
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:09,210
It'd be just as ridiculous. It was when
I was seven when I was a little boy.

2098
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,860
It's just as fucking stupid.

2099
01:58:11,190 --> 01:58:14,430
I don't know if it is what is involved in
three different fucking wars right now.

2100
01:58:14,431 --> 01:58:19,080
The economy is based on unfixable bullshit
that nobody understands the fucking,

2101
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:24,070
the, the, the, the whole idea
of what America is supposed
to be is in decline. Well,

2102
01:58:24,071 --> 01:58:24,281
I know,

2103
01:58:24,281 --> 01:58:27,570
but if you keep a positive mental attitude
and try to effect change in any way

2104
01:58:27,571 --> 01:58:31,740
you can, you're, you're feeding into the
solution and not the cause. That's true.

2105
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,650
You know what I'm saying? Like you can't
just go, fuck, this shit is shitty.

2106
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,750
Let me just fucking high.
That is true.

2107
01:58:36,770 --> 01:58:40,590
But you got to own it head on and
everybody has got to do their part and get

2108
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:44,260
positive with it. Where we're going
to build shit up. Yeah. Correct. Yeah,

2109
01:58:44,261 --> 01:58:44,771
that's right.

2110
01:58:44,771 --> 01:58:49,330
Give me some boy type music and I'm
just saying all of this deserves to get

2111
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:54,331
pushed upwards and not just quit in
ours and motivation and get CEOs,

2112
01:58:55,720 --> 01:59:00,110
get them up there playing
the mayhem philosophy. I
yeah, I'm working on anyways.

2113
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:02,020
Play time music. Yeah, you damn right.

2114
01:59:02,021 --> 01:59:07,021
I go out with those ankle bracelets or
listening to mayhem management is a side

2115
01:59:07,661 --> 01:59:08,980
one tape to,

2116
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:13,210
you certainly should try to push for
positivity shirt and certainly should try

2117
01:59:13,211 --> 01:59:14,650
to push things in the right direction.

2118
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:16,660
But at a certain point in
time you wonder like, man,

2119
01:59:16,661 --> 01:59:19,600
am I going to die and pot still
going to be illegal? Oh Man.

2120
01:59:19,601 --> 01:59:21,910
If you human [inaudible]
corrupt and it's like, it's,

2121
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:25,650
I'm going to leave this earth exactly
the same way I came in. Knob is,

2122
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:26,940
it's a fucking mess.
It's not going to,

2123
01:59:26,941 --> 01:59:31,030
pupils in my life made that
argument forever that you
got to do it again. Right?

2124
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:35,500
It's like that was the good old quick
enough. Evolution's not quick enough. I'm,

2125
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:39,220
I'm, I'm, you know, I feel like
it needs to catch the fuck up.

2126
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,350
I think social evolution
needs to catch the fuck up.

2127
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:45,520
The evolution of the human being and
its interaction with its environment,

2128
01:59:45,521 --> 01:59:49,240
it needs to catch up.
So you just technologies on this,

2129
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:52,900
we're at this fever pitch of technology
and the human animal and it's all

2130
01:59:52,901 --> 01:59:55,840
ridiculous bullshit that it drags
along with. It is lagging behind.

2131
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:57,860
That's what I think what I mean.

2132
01:59:57,870 --> 02:00:01,280
So eventually we're all
going to be plugged into the
computers like transcendent

2133
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:04,780
man. Right? Most likely something
along those lines is going to happen.

2134
02:00:04,810 --> 02:00:08,920
It's just seems to me that
that's inevitable that our
integration is so fucking

2135
02:00:08,921 --> 02:00:12,250
complete as it is without it being
a part of our actual physical body.

2136
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:14,920
You leave your fucking cell phone at
home and it feels like you left your Dick

2137
02:00:14,921 --> 02:00:15,580
in a jar.

2138
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:18,760
It's going to be to the point where it's
an air plastic surgery is going to be

2139
02:00:18,761 --> 02:00:22,300
like taken out of your eye and upgrading
your eyes with the new night vision I

2140
02:00:22,301 --> 02:00:23,320
line and stuff like that.

2141
02:00:23,321 --> 02:00:27,940
Like you're going to likely replacing
parts on your body. Yeah, of course.

2142
02:00:27,941 --> 02:00:28,601
That'd be awesome.

2143
02:00:28,601 --> 02:00:32,170
But there's going to be people to cock
block all that stuff too because people

2144
02:00:32,171 --> 02:00:34,570
are afraid of science and
technology. Jesus people. Yeah,

2145
02:00:34,571 --> 02:00:35,830
but if there's money to be had in it,

2146
02:00:35,831 --> 02:00:37,900
it will probably exist as
long as it can be patented.

2147
02:00:37,901 --> 02:00:41,260
The real issue is when things are
awesome and people are scared of them and

2148
02:00:41,261 --> 02:00:44,890
they're not patentable like plants that
are psychedelic plants and that's the

2149
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:46,000
reason why those things are illegal.

2150
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:50,050
Because if psychedelic plants were just
a result of some fucking formula that

2151
02:00:50,051 --> 02:00:52,420
someone figured out in the
lab and he had a patent on it,

2152
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:53,680
well by Jimminy cricket,

2153
02:00:53,681 --> 02:00:56,950
that Shit would be available to prescribe
for someone if they had some sort of

2154
02:00:56,951 --> 02:01:01,660
an ailment cause there's a fuck load
of money to be made from MDM a for

2155
02:01:01,661 --> 02:01:03,490
posttraumatic stress disorder.
If that shit was,

2156
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:06,940
if somebody had created that and
owned it and it hadn't been demonized,

2157
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:10,450
it would be for sure some something that
they would make a shitload of money off

2158
02:01:10,451 --> 02:01:13,120
of. You know, psychedelics are
coming back in medicine now.

2159
02:01:13,121 --> 02:01:16,930
There's a little slightly, yeah, there is.
Yeah. It's fascinating isn't it? Finally,

2160
02:01:16,931 --> 02:01:20,800
people are starting to accept the cancer
patients for a bunch of terminally ill

2161
02:01:20,801 --> 02:01:23,470
patients,
given one dose of mushrooms one time,

2162
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:28,390
still 12 months later had significant
benefits for accepting what's going on

2163
02:01:28,391 --> 02:01:31,420
with people who've had cancer and taken
Iowasca and the cancer's gone into

2164
02:01:31,421 --> 02:01:34,210
remission because they believe that it's
completely altered the way they look

2165
02:01:34,211 --> 02:01:38,290
and think about their body and the way
they're allows their body to naturally

2166
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:39,124
heal itself.

2167
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:43,070
To be relaxed and system can function
correctly in a mall or something.

2168
02:01:43,071 --> 02:01:46,550
I'll ask you is that this
orally active form of DMT?

2169
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:48,920
We talked about it so many
times in this podcast,

2170
02:01:48,921 --> 02:01:51,250
but for the people who don't
know what it is in the wood,

2171
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:53,270
in the jungles of South America,

2172
02:01:53,271 --> 02:01:58,220
they've figured out a way to take the
leaves of one plant which contain DMT and

2173
02:01:58,221 --> 02:02:01,400
the vine of another plant,
which contains an Mao inhibitor,

2174
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:05,180
which makes DMT or Iliac
breaking open the head. Yeah,

2175
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:09,680
he definitely heard that day and do
that. And one of his shows, yes, he did.

2176
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:13,130
He said he didn't get off.
He said it really. He said
it was interesting and cool,

2177
02:02:13,131 --> 02:02:17,060
but you know what I've heard from people,
especially from Mckenna,

2178
02:02:17,061 --> 02:02:19,970
used to talk about how when you
go down to the South America,

2179
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:22,610
they have to really trust
you before the dose you up.

2180
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:25,910
Like they don't want some crazy gringos
running around howling at the moon.

2181
02:02:25,911 --> 02:02:27,500
So they give you like week doses.
He knew,

2182
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:31,940
he was saying that as the tourism of
these IOWASCA communities become more and

2183
02:02:31,941 --> 02:02:34,430
more prevalent as more and more people
go down to have this experience,

2184
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:37,070
there's a lot of people that are having
bad trips and there's a lot of people

2185
02:02:37,071 --> 02:02:38,840
that are wary about the gringos.

2186
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:42,050
So they come in and you come in with a
fucking camera crew and you're like, hey,

2187
02:02:42,051 --> 02:02:44,960
I want to try and tie Wasco and you've
got a ring on your thumb. You know,

2188
02:02:44,961 --> 02:02:46,600
like you've ordained does, they're
going to look in, you know,

2189
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:48,950
give him some weekends. Shit. You know,

2190
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:52,520
I don't feel like he
doesn't give you our God,

2191
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:55,550
but if you,
if you have the strong shit,

2192
02:02:55,551 --> 02:02:58,460
I mean everybody says when you take
the strong shit that the experience is

2193
02:02:58,461 --> 02:03:00,500
undeniable.
So it seemed to me that like,

2194
02:03:00,501 --> 02:03:02,740
I've heard people have
DMT trips like that too.

2195
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:04,970
I met a woman on the
plane back from Brazil.

2196
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,530
That was the whole reason she was there.
Well,

2197
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:10,640
they will tell you want go fry
was a spiritual journey. Yeah.

2198
02:03:10,641 --> 02:03:13,670
Well DMT is legal and it's
illegal in Brazil as well.

2199
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:15,080
There's two different churches,

2200
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:19,240
something University of Division
Division and another one that,

2201
02:03:19,820 --> 02:03:24,370
there's two different churches that use
a DMT as a sacrament along with, uh,

2202
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:28,760
using, uh, Christianity. So they pray
about Jesus and then they take Iowasca.

2203
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:31,880
Yeah, it's fucking nuts, man.
Interesting. Yeah, it's, but it's,

2204
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:33,980
it's legal somehow or
another through some,

2205
02:03:33,981 --> 02:03:38,630
and it actually won in the Supreme Court.
So it's a Brazil. Yeah, no. In America.

2206
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,490
In America, they brought it
over from Brazil. It's you,

2207
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:45,140
they're accepted in Brazil and they're
accepted. This is their sacrament.

2208
02:03:45,141 --> 02:03:45,650
This I don't want.

2209
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:48,620
So you can take this logistical under your
leg is straight and that, yes, I know.

2210
02:03:48,621 --> 02:03:51,850
Religious freedom, you can take it
and it's in the end of their sex in a,

2211
02:03:51,851 --> 02:03:54,580
I know for sure in New
Mexico. Yeah. But there's,

2212
02:03:54,581 --> 02:03:57,350
I think there's other places
in America to just convert.

2213
02:03:57,351 --> 02:04:01,390
Just take some DMT and sing songs
about Jesus. And when you're, you know,

2214
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:03,560
when you're high on p and t,
the songs about Jesus,

2215
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:06,110
well apparently they have
really strong stuff too. I've,

2216
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:08,920
I have a friend who did it
and went through the, the
whole experience and said,

2217
02:04:08,930 --> 02:04:10,760
it's so bizarre. He said, first of all,

2218
02:04:10,761 --> 02:04:14,270
everyone's wearing uniforms that were
like the same clothes and they're wearing

2219
02:04:14,271 --> 02:04:18,770
uniforms and they're taking this really
strong DMT brew and they're singing

2220
02:04:18,771 --> 02:04:22,520
songs about Jesus. And they said, it's
like, what the fuck is going on here?

2221
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:25,330
It's like, it's so weird. There's
so many different messages in there.

2222
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:29,960
It's so strange. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a fan. I
would hate to be triple a ball and Jesus,

2223
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:31,100
y'all or not,
man,

2224
02:04:31,101 --> 02:04:34,400
maybe you get used to it and you start
to like it and what Jesus represents to

2225
02:04:34,401 --> 02:04:37,200
you with something like super
duper positive and you know,

2226
02:04:37,201 --> 02:04:39,990
really loving and all knowing
and you know, and then,

2227
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:41,640
and actually thinking about this thing,

2228
02:04:41,641 --> 02:04:44,340
you can actually manifest those
types of thoughts and ideas.

2229
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:46,620
And then that's why they do it.
Yeah, I can understand that.

2230
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:50,130
They can understand of being in a group
of people and no matter what it is,

2231
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:54,090
just their use of Jesus as the term.
You guys are all like connected.

2232
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:56,640
You know what I mean?
Like I feel I felt bad experience before.

2233
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:58,680
Unfortunate they've ordained,
didn't get a good dose.

2234
02:04:58,681 --> 02:05:02,550
I would love to have here at his fucking
full blast off to the store cause the

2235
02:05:02,551 --> 02:05:04,650
alligators.
I don't want to go to the Amazon.

2236
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:08,220
I would love to hear what people are
doing it here. First of all there's,

2237
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:11,460
there's Shamans had been trained that
have come to America and I know where I

2238
02:05:11,461 --> 02:05:13,590
could do it here. I know a bunch
of people. I can do it here with,

2239
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:16,620
you can do it here, especially in
Hawaiian as much people do it at Hawaii.

2240
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:19,850
What's that? You're going to do
it in places. My, my point is,

2241
02:05:19,851 --> 02:05:22,590
is it like you don't have
to go to the five hours.

2242
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:26,960
We're going to key sort of labor.
But you know,

2243
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:28,830
this is one of the things we
want to talk to you about.

2244
02:05:28,831 --> 02:05:31,290
Before we were talking about
why I like to live in the woods.

2245
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:33,870
You know why I would like to live
like way the fuck away from people.

2246
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:38,550
I believe that one of the best reasons
why you take Iowasca in the jungle is

2247
02:05:38,551 --> 02:05:43,551
that you are in this place where the
energy of the plant and the experience,

2248
02:05:45,391 --> 02:05:48,720
it's, it all comes from this
one spot and that one spot,

2249
02:05:48,770 --> 02:05:52,530
it doesn't have a lot of Wifi signals. It
doesn't have pollution. It doesn't have,

2250
02:05:52,770 --> 02:05:56,700
this doesn't have cell phones fucking
flying through your ear and radiation.

2251
02:05:56,850 --> 02:06:01,560
It's just nature man. And there's a
silence that comes with like real nature,

2252
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:05,520
you know? And all you hear is
animals and monkeys, deer hunting,

2253
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:10,960
deer hunting was sitting in a tree stand
looking at a beautiful ridge just like

2254
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:12,430
waiting and I'm going to kill you.

2255
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:16,470
Just you're sitting there and it's just
so beautiful and they meditated. You're,

2256
02:06:16,471 --> 02:06:19,050
then you're sitting there and
the sun is coming up and man,

2257
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:21,830
I could see it's super event.
Like you're like,

2258
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:25,170
I just looking for any movement
or hear any sound. It's crazy.

2259
02:06:25,171 --> 02:06:28,690
It's like you're real predator.
You're really tuning into

2260
02:06:30,190 --> 02:06:31,690
boost and don't move.

2261
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:35,810
I'm going to do Iowasca in a hospital
because that's where life and death is.

2262
02:06:36,190 --> 02:06:40,500
You know,
scratching,

2263
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:46,820
scratching your face off in a
corner. Like, I dunno dude. Um,

2264
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:49,710
I read about Mark Zuckerberg,
the guy who produced Facebook,

2265
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:53,580
started hunting and gathering his own
food now because he wanted to take

2266
02:06:53,581 --> 02:06:56,500
responsibility for the food he ate and
he was just, can eat vegetables and nuts.

2267
02:06:56,530 --> 02:06:59,980
It's meat. He killed himself, so he
shot a fucking bison. Nice. You know,

2268
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,740
I liked that. I liked that. I did, man.
You know, the, the hunter gatherer needs,

2269
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:08,970
it's just like, it's very much like
the pussy needs. If you neglect them,

2270
02:07:08,971 --> 02:07:10,380
they'll go somewhere direction.

2271
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:14,100
I think he's just practicing Facebook
to collapse. Yeah. He's like,

2272
02:07:14,101 --> 02:07:17,860
I need to figure out how to make food,
Facebook and civilization just,

2273
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:20,750
he's got a compound, I'm sure by now.
That guy's got billions of dollars.

2274
02:07:20,751 --> 02:07:22,800
I was like some crazy ass money.

2275
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:26,160
Killed it with a knife to to
say compounds of the way to go.

2276
02:07:26,161 --> 02:07:29,330
If you can afford it.
A big place where I said,

2277
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:36,390
Oh, you might want to go deep,
deep, hi high fence compound. Can't

2278
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:41,290
wait to, you're going to be awesome.
Patrol, the perimeter, whatever.

2279
02:07:41,291 --> 02:07:44,340
Dude, we're gonna write man. Wild
animals inside. That's what I mean. Yeah,

2280
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:47,560
you're on fire truck. We
have mountain lions. Well,

2281
02:07:47,561 --> 02:07:50,860
there's a thing called the
firebreak system that you
can set up on roofs now and

2282
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:52,900
what it is is when a
certain heat is reached,

2283
02:07:52,901 --> 02:07:57,040
they disperse this chemical all over
your roof that makes the house much less

2284
02:07:57,041 --> 02:07:59,590
vulnerable to fire.
So you've got to set things like that up.

2285
02:07:59,620 --> 02:08:00,610
If you're going to live in the woods,

2286
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:03,700
you got to clear out the area all around
your house and make sure that you got

2287
02:08:03,701 --> 02:08:08,530
the fuck fucking most powerful fireproof
windows available and set up that fire

2288
02:08:08,531 --> 02:08:11,050
break system and then wait,
we're going to talk in here.

2289
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:15,460
Make sure you can control your sprinkler
system to and all around the house.

2290
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:18,640
And you're still, you're
probably fucked. He still,

2291
02:08:18,641 --> 02:08:20,910
you're probably fuck cause those
embers embers flies in the air.

2292
02:08:20,911 --> 02:08:24,300
They just land on shifts. Can't
put together. Oh yeah, I'm fine.

2293
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:25,630
When the case happened,

2294
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:30,340
I always used to stocked up waters
funded people up until two weeks ago,

2295
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:34,210
number in San Diego, Orange County
of that blackout blackout happened.

2296
02:08:34,211 --> 02:08:37,450
I realized I got a three and a half
month old baby at home, a four year old.

2297
02:08:37,451 --> 02:08:41,290
My wife and I am completely
unprepared and you have no food.

2298
02:08:41,291 --> 02:08:43,780
I have no way to keep painting
called the annuity heat anything up.

2299
02:08:44,230 --> 02:08:47,980
Then I drove down the hill and it's dark.
Why live in Dana Point?

2300
02:08:47,981 --> 02:08:51,520
It's totally dark. Gas stations don't
work. Then I'm thinking, wait a minute,

2301
02:08:52,890 --> 02:08:55,210
I don't get that good a mileage on my car.

2302
02:08:55,211 --> 02:08:58,060
How quick till I run out of
gas and you can't pump any gas.

2303
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:02,020
I think it would take four or five days
for things just to go complete store gas

2304
02:09:02,021 --> 02:09:02,854
at your house,

2305
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:08,320
trashcan giant gas tank and have
your own gas at your house. Yeah,

2306
02:09:08,321 --> 02:09:13,080
that's legit. You could do it. Can you?
I'm sure you're allowed to take time out.

2307
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:16,300
You're not allowed to have a bunch of gas
in your backyard. If you have a garage,

2308
02:09:16,310 --> 02:09:21,040
you shit you can do is you can keep your
own gas station in your house. Yeah.

2309
02:09:21,050 --> 02:09:25,450
You could fuel up,
get a gas tank that said farmers do it.

2310
02:09:25,451 --> 02:09:26,590
You're saying it to legal.

2311
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:29,950
I think if you're a farmer you probably
can do it because that's your business,

2312
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:34,950
but I don't think you can have a gas
station on your lawn. It's probably zoned.

2313
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:40,060
It's probably,
that would be the dopest shit ever.

2314
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:43,270
If you had your own gas station,
you would think that like Jay Leno,

2315
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:44,350
they may be that.
You could do,

2316
02:09:44,351 --> 02:09:48,280
you could buy a shitty gas station and
just use it for your own personal gas.

2317
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:50,760
Nah, Bro. Gas Stations,

2318
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:54,550
it doesn't have a big of his house
and I'm imagining it actually,

2319
02:09:54,551 --> 02:09:55,280
am I making that up?

2320
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:58,750
The gas stations ever go wonder gas
stations seem to be open all the time.

2321
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:02,350
It was less than a guest. They should
went over. I guess they do. Some of them,

2322
02:10:02,351 --> 02:10:06,060
you know, I'll tell you in
downtown Boston, there's
no gas stations. It's true.

2323
02:10:06,061 --> 02:10:09,070
The two that were there
closed. It's true. It's true.

2324
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:12,880
That's no cause we ran out of gas
on the way somewhere and I make it,

2325
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,900
I have, you know, a little bit
left the car. We drove all around.

2326
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:18,430
You notice like driving downtown Boston.

2327
02:10:18,890 --> 02:10:22,960
So we finally stepped you went to
the fire station and asked for gas.

2328
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:28,420
Really? I had to hire a driver
cusp 50 bucks to drive me.

2329
02:10:28,530 --> 02:10:31,990
It took probably a 10 minute drive from
where we stayed in Bob and get some gas

2330
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:33,530
and go back your car.

2331
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,630
Yeah. Boston's a weird place with
zoning and shit too. You know, they're,

2332
02:10:37,631 --> 02:10:40,220
they really prize their
historical relevance, you know,

2333
02:10:40,221 --> 02:10:42,170
so you gotta be real careful
where you build things.

2334
02:10:42,171 --> 02:10:44,090
And it's a trip though
when you drive down,

2335
02:10:44,091 --> 02:10:48,800
you see those signs on some of the
buildings built in 1650 yeah, for sure.

2336
02:10:48,801 --> 02:10:51,970
Look at Beacon Hill. That whole
neighborhood was from like 1700 yeah.

2337
02:10:51,971 --> 02:10:54,290
And then nuts. That is nuts.
We're all walking around there.

2338
02:10:54,291 --> 02:10:57,230
I felt like I was back in time. A
budget. Beacon hills. Weird too,

2339
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:00,050
because it isn't a lot of
it. Like apartments. Yup.

2340
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:02,270
They're all old bank
building park right there.

2341
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:06,290
Big buildings that are like houses
there. Sort of a more rural houses. Yeah.

2342
02:11:06,370 --> 02:11:10,620
Row houses connected to each other and
they were worth a shitload of money for

2343
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:14,900
three, four, five, nine. Dot. And there's
no backyard, just get nothing. Nothing,

2344
02:11:14,930 --> 02:11:18,380
no backyard. Just to house jammed right
next to another house. It looks cool.

2345
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:21,310
That looks cool. And across
the street there's a park. Yep.

2346
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:25,610
I ran through that all the time. It
was crazy. The Boston Commons, crazy.

2347
02:11:25,611 --> 02:11:30,340
Great City city man. It's amazing.
Really awesome. Like you're, you know,

2348
02:11:30,350 --> 02:11:32,900
just to see all that old stuff,

2349
02:11:32,901 --> 02:11:35,600
you're just like shut the
ultimate busing experience.

2350
02:11:35,601 --> 02:11:38,870
Saint Paddy's Day dropkick Murphys,
guys like Robbie,

2351
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:42,740
but on Saint Patty's Day was great.
Oh my God.

2352
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:44,870
I'm going to England to Birmingham.

2353
02:11:44,871 --> 02:11:47,660
We're going to for the UFC in November
and I think I'm going to take a trip to

2354
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,300
Stonehenge.
I'm going to go check that shit out.

2355
02:11:50,301 --> 02:11:54,460
I want to see some real old
monuments. Cool. What is
that anyway? Don't want meat.

2356
02:11:55,110 --> 02:11:58,010
They believe it's some sort of a calendar.
They don't know exactly who build it.

2357
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:00,470
You know, it's a fascinating
little piece of sculpture.

2358
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:05,110
It was just some caveman was like whatever
the good thing. Yeah. I mean that's,

2359
02:12:05,130 --> 02:12:10,040
but it is weird. It's a
weird, a weird structure. You
know. It's weird cause it's,

2360
02:12:10,041 --> 02:12:12,470
you know, how did they do,
like, could they, I don't know.

2361
02:12:12,471 --> 02:12:14,870
Is there was something strange thinking,
like how do they get that up?

2362
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:18,440
They don't know, but probably leavers
and you know, probably in a system,

2363
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:21,830
I use a bunch of trees over there before
when it was probably a big mountain and

2364
02:12:21,831 --> 02:12:25,160
they just carved it out out of the
mountain and it looks like they carried,

2365
02:12:25,161 --> 02:12:27,820
it did. There's a, there's a, um,

2366
02:12:27,821 --> 02:12:31,610
a crazy carving into the mountains
of a horse. You ever seen that?

2367
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:34,580
It's like this white carving.
I don't know how the fuck they did it,

2368
02:12:34,581 --> 02:12:37,520
but it's carved and they don't even know
who did it. Just thousands of years old.

2369
02:12:37,521 --> 02:12:41,420
Wait is, where is that in England and
England? Yeah. Yeah. You know, there's,

2370
02:12:41,421 --> 02:12:44,870
there's stuff like that that they sort
of found and no one remembers how it got

2371
02:12:44,871 --> 02:12:47,900
there. You know, like a Stonehenge
is a, is a perfect example.

2372
02:12:47,901 --> 02:12:51,980
Like they found it and by the time
they found that when you know,

2373
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:55,430
when modern times people found it,
they were like, what the fuck is this?

2374
02:12:55,580 --> 02:13:00,410
And everybody's like Dat. Yeah. What
the fuck is that? I can't remember.

2375
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:05,600
It's so long ago. We were here for
years, been around for so long,

2376
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:08,840
you know, and then they have crop circles
all over the place down there too.

2377
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:12,650
It's such a freaky fucking little place.
We mean crops are going to crop circles.

2378
02:13:12,970 --> 02:13:15,920
You never seen crop circles.
Those designs it show up and wheat fields,

2379
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:21,140
some of them. Oh they did that back in
the day. Yeah. And it's the ultimate,

2380
02:13:21,170 --> 02:13:25,880
it's the ultimate like what they are
for sure. A lot of them are hoaxes.

2381
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:28,760
A huge percentage of the park.
Yeah. I thought the kids did that.

2382
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:31,650
And when I say hoaxes, that doesn't mean
like the rest of them were made aliens.

2383
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:33,180
But I think there's some,

2384
02:13:33,181 --> 02:13:37,380
there's some crazy technology involved
in it and I don't know if we have a full

2385
02:13:37,381 --> 02:13:41,070
assessment in accounting of all the
technology that the government or that

2386
02:13:41,071 --> 02:13:44,070
anyone you know at the highest level
of science really possesses right now.

2387
02:13:44,071 --> 02:13:44,851
I don't necessarily know,

2388
02:13:44,851 --> 02:13:48,510
especially when it comes to
military intelligence and
I think we've always had a

2389
02:13:48,511 --> 02:13:52,080
lot of secrets in this country and it's
very likely that there's things that can

2390
02:13:52,081 --> 02:13:53,070
produce crop circles.

2391
02:13:53,071 --> 02:13:55,740
Like they can shoot down a fucking laser
beam on a certain patch of earth and

2392
02:13:55,741 --> 02:13:58,380
create a pattern in the sand or in the,
in the wheat fields.

2393
02:13:58,470 --> 02:14:00,330
I don't think that's beyond
the realm of possibility.

2394
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:02,610
If you can have nuclear weapons,
if you could have, you know,

2395
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:06,390
international instant communication
via cell phone networks and data plans,

2396
02:14:06,391 --> 02:14:09,240
we could send photographs and videos to
another person on the other side of the

2397
02:14:09,241 --> 02:14:11,820
fucking world almost instantaneously.

2398
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,580
I don't think it's beyond the realm
of possibility to think that you could

2399
02:14:14,581 --> 02:14:18,690
somehow or another imprint something from
a satellite, something flying overhead.

2400
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:21,360
Who knows? I don't know.
And I don't know why.

2401
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:24,780
You know what it might be simply someone
figured out how to do it and they

2402
02:14:24,781 --> 02:14:26,820
wanted to implement whether
or not they could, you know,

2403
02:14:26,821 --> 02:14:28,890
and then the ones they had it,
they just keep fucking with people.

2404
02:14:28,891 --> 02:14:32,160
If you had the patterns, if you could
make up all kinds of crazy shit,

2405
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:35,160
why would my thing be like, hey,
I want to push it off a crops?

2406
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:38,580
What's a good question? But like why
would I waste my talents on that?

2407
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:42,450
If I was that smart, I would do something
way cooler. I make way more money.

2408
02:14:42,610 --> 02:14:46,020
You say that but listen, some of them are
hoaxes and some of them are beautiful.

2409
02:14:46,021 --> 02:14:48,750
These hoaxes are amazing.
I mean when I say hoaxes we know,

2410
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:52,140
I mean there are human created works
of art, not a mystery whatsoever.

2411
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:53,910
And these human creative works of art,

2412
02:14:53,911 --> 02:14:55,960
they've done like these guys
called the circle makers.

2413
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:59,040
There's got a website called circle
makers.org brushed up and they, yeah,

2414
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:03,030
will they give boards and they measure
things and they do these dope ass designs,

2415
02:15:03,210 --> 02:15:06,000
you know?
But what what they've done is,

2416
02:15:06,001 --> 02:15:08,610
you know what they've done is question.
You know,

2417
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:11,400
it's shown that you can make
these crop circles on your own,

2418
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:15,060
but some of them are weird man. Some of
them, like they show up in like an hour.

2419
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:17,310
Like you have to believe
these people's reports,

2420
02:15:17,311 --> 02:15:18,780
which is sketchy at best of course,

2421
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:21,360
but you're dealing with these people that
have no reason to lie. These farmers,

2422
02:15:21,361 --> 02:15:24,390
they fly over an area and then they
come back an hour later and there's

2423
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:29,391
something that's three football fields
long and it's got 690 perfect circles in

2424
02:15:29,801 --> 02:15:32,990
an a varying sizes all in
some sort of a fractal.

2425
02:15:33,010 --> 02:15:36,240
You said that first sentence was like,
wait,

2426
02:15:36,241 --> 02:15:38,490
you're selling tickets
to see this at your farm?

2427
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:43,320
He gets real attention whatsoever. Hey
guys, look at this crop circle. Oh my God,

2428
02:15:43,321 --> 02:15:46,890
it's a farmer who has the crops are 100%
and you listen. Some of them for sure,

2429
02:15:46,891 --> 02:15:48,150
definitely no question at all,

2430
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:52,140
but some of them are gigantic and
most certainly would have been.

2431
02:15:52,190 --> 02:15:54,750
It would have taken enough time
that people would have known.

2432
02:15:54,751 --> 02:15:58,230
It's like they've hired people to do
them for advertisers and it's very time

2433
02:15:58,231 --> 02:16:00,630
consuming.
It's extraordinarily time consuming hurts.

2434
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:05,790
You can't bang off these
giant things inside of, uh,

2435
02:16:06,010 --> 02:16:08,370
inside of an hour or whatever
the fuck these people are saying.

2436
02:16:08,430 --> 02:16:11,790
So if they're telling the truth,
then it could possibly be something else.

2437
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,240
It doesn't necessarily have to be just
always people flattening boards out.

2438
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:17,850
And I know there's a lot of other
science behind it in quotes,

2439
02:16:17,851 --> 02:16:20,670
science because they've, uh,
they've detected there's,

2440
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:24,690
there's growth nodes and areas where
the stems of the plant has actually

2441
02:16:24,691 --> 02:16:26,610
exploded,
like it had been microwaved.

2442
02:16:26,930 --> 02:16:29,130
And then instead of just
being bent over these things,

2443
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:32,380
these things have had some
almost boiled with energy.

2444
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:35,830
You're saying their symptoms, like
sometimes it does that. Yeah, we're not,

2445
02:16:35,831 --> 02:16:36,910
and I want to say symptoms.

2446
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:41,050
I'll say evidence that points to the
fact that this is all is all the shit.

2447
02:16:41,290 --> 02:16:43,510
By the way, hold on. This is all
shit that I've read on the Internet,

2448
02:16:43,570 --> 02:16:46,460
so I have no idea how much
of this is 100% legit.

2449
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:49,540
But the idea is that what people
questioned about the crop circles,

2450
02:16:49,541 --> 02:16:52,600
the so called crop circle
experts and efficient models,

2451
02:16:52,601 --> 02:16:55,510
one of the things they point to is the
fact that there's an actual change in the

2452
02:16:55,511 --> 02:16:58,450
chemical structure of the plant
once it's been turned into this,

2453
02:16:58,630 --> 02:17:01,630
this circle that something has
happened to it. So it's been heated up.

2454
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:06,200
Like I said, it could have been, it could
be some sort of technology if looks at,

2455
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:11,020
say if you wanted to etch something
with lasers onto a piece of metal,

2456
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:15,010
you know you could program a design into
a computer and that computer could act

2457
02:17:15,011 --> 02:17:17,440
something and if you had a laser
big enough and powerful enough,

2458
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:19,360
it could be as big as my doom poster.

2459
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:24,540
You can x some make some design with
a laser in that just using a computer.

2460
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:28,720
Why couldn't you do that from a satellite
down on some fucking wheat field?

2461
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:30,730
Of course you could.
It would just be just as possible.

2462
02:17:30,731 --> 02:17:33,970
I think if you've got the
potential to do it at close range,

2463
02:17:33,971 --> 02:17:37,300
and then we know there's a lot of shit
that we do at long range and we also know

2464
02:17:37,301 --> 02:17:38,560
that lasers,
you know,

2465
02:17:38,561 --> 02:17:42,790
a powerful laser doesn't really lose
its power over a long distance. Right?

2466
02:17:42,791 --> 02:17:46,540
Isn't that the case? Like these, these
laser things and one of the, one of like,

2467
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:48,680
one of the things that's
dangerous about those laser pens,

2468
02:17:48,681 --> 02:17:50,300
it was really powerful ones.
Yeah.

2469
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:54,050
You can point them at fucking planes
and they literally hit the cockpit car

2470
02:17:54,051 --> 02:17:57,250
plants. Yeah. Yeah. It's incredible.

2471
02:17:57,251 --> 02:17:59,970
And I wonder if the case
could be made that, you know,

2472
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:01,330
if you could do that with a laser,

2473
02:18:01,331 --> 02:18:03,430
maybe you could do that with
something that mimics a laser,

2474
02:18:03,431 --> 02:18:07,090
but at some in some way or another
is like an amateur, a manipulator.

2475
02:18:07,260 --> 02:18:09,730
Darren does something. Yeah.
Who the fuck knows? I mean,

2476
02:18:09,731 --> 02:18:11,950
who at a certain point in time,

2477
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:14,200
you've got to look at things that we
absolutely know. People who've done,

2478
02:18:14,201 --> 02:18:17,620
there's a goddamned space station up
there and they shoot rockets filled with

2479
02:18:17,621 --> 02:18:20,800
people and they go up and dock with this
thing and everybody's hanging out there

2480
02:18:20,801 --> 02:18:23,440
and partying the space. We
know that's real. You know,

2481
02:18:23,441 --> 02:18:28,090
as bizarre as that is shooting people in
giant metal tubes propelled by fire up

2482
02:18:28,091 --> 02:18:33,091
into the sky to doc with some floating
metal fucking machine that's up there.

2483
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:36,730
The government is just like who
never texted us from ourselves.

2484
02:18:36,731 --> 02:18:39,790
Like we don't want you to know about
know awesome crop circle. But no,

2485
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:44,440
I think there's a lot of things that
they do on the sneak tip like drones and

2486
02:18:44,441 --> 02:18:46,930
you know there's, there's, there's
bugs that look like, you know,

2487
02:18:46,931 --> 02:18:50,620
they look like bugs but they're spy
cameras and drones that are completely

2488
02:18:50,621 --> 02:18:53,620
unmanned minority report. Yeah,
I'll do, they've got some,

2489
02:18:53,710 --> 02:18:57,130
they've got some legit shit that looks
like little bugs and the flies around and

2490
02:18:57,131 --> 02:18:58,470
it can fly in Iraq.
You know,

2491
02:18:58,510 --> 02:19:01,390
I mean they've got some
incredible technology and you
would think that something

2492
02:19:01,391 --> 02:19:04,090
like this, like something that would,
you could make a crop circle with.

2493
02:19:04,270 --> 02:19:07,210
You could also use to do all
kinds of crazy shit with,

2494
02:19:07,390 --> 02:19:11,620
I mean if there's a sort of a technology
that can manipulate the patterns in

2495
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:13,010
wheat fields,
like Tavi,

2496
02:19:13,011 --> 02:19:16,390
there's certain things you could do it
where it just barbecue someone out of the

2497
02:19:16,391 --> 02:19:19,810
fucking Sky B Cup circles are level
one. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.

2498
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:22,930
Or it's just practicing where
it hits like the accuracy.

2499
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:25,570
That's the market from
gears of war part one.

2500
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:29,000
We could you imagine or have figure
out a way to have a satellite like that

2501
02:19:29,001 --> 02:19:33,110
flies over a city and then anytime you
want something done, it just zooms in.

2502
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:36,920
Like Google Earth has an instant
closeup view of you and you disappear.

2503
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:41,960
Just boom, fizzle, palm
bay up and that's it.

2504
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:45,950
No person probably close,
pretty close. Probably close.

2505
02:19:46,580 --> 02:19:50,000
And the accuracy of establishing something
like what better way to demonstrate

2506
02:19:50,001 --> 02:19:52,970
the accuracy then make a fucking
design in a wheat field. Say, look,

2507
02:19:52,971 --> 02:19:56,870
we can do this. Have
people who know, dude,

2508
02:19:56,990 --> 02:19:58,640
that's a far reaching connection,

2509
02:19:58,641 --> 02:20:00,780
but so is everything that
we do every day that week,

2510
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:05,390
the Internet based travel with. All
right, so you're discounting this though.

2511
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:08,960
Everybody in their fucking brother
on the planet is a reporter now.

2512
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:11,210
That's why the Arab spring sprung up.
Guess why?

2513
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:15,410
Everybody's twittering each other
about how the fuck fuck this regime and

2514
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:18,290
everyone's connected now. So now, okay,

2515
02:20:18,350 --> 02:20:22,320
so now we would know if somebody had a
technology to do something and it has

2516
02:20:22,321 --> 02:20:23,670
done it, they would. We would.

2517
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:28,310
Somebody would know unless that technology
was created at area 51 and if that

2518
02:20:28,311 --> 02:20:28,761
was the case,

2519
02:20:28,761 --> 02:20:32,570
they have a long seated history of only
allowing people in there that absolutely

2520
02:20:32,571 --> 02:20:35,660
fucking know how to keep a secret because
there's a lot of shit that's gone down

2521
02:20:35,661 --> 02:20:38,510
in area 51 and very few
credible reports of any of it.

2522
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:43,220
The doctor Robert Lasar might be the only
one and he's showing it to probably be

2523
02:20:43,221 --> 02:20:47,450
a liar.
The problem is people talk like you know,

2524
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:51,620
just gave you an example area 51 dude,
there's thousands of people over decades,

2525
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:55,220
decades of worked at area 51
developed by secret technology.

2526
02:20:55,221 --> 02:20:59,150
Somebody would want to get tested because
they're patriots because they believe

2527
02:20:59,151 --> 02:21:01,520
in this country because they work for
the military because that's a part of

2528
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:03,050
their job.
They're a part of a big thing.

2529
02:21:03,170 --> 02:21:07,130
When you're a part of developing military
weapons, secret military weapons,

2530
02:21:07,310 --> 02:21:08,360
there's a certain amount of pride.

2531
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:11,780
A lot of those guys take in the fact
that they are developing the very best

2532
02:21:11,781 --> 02:21:15,170
weapons and they're developing them in
secret in these fucking bunkers that are

2533
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:19,700
built into the side of mountains.
Got To show the weapon though. Yes,

2534
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:22,790
and they have, that's where the fucking
stealth bomber came from directly.

2535
02:21:22,830 --> 02:21:25,730
Area 51 there's a lot of nutty
shit that they worked on for years,

2536
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:29,180
but this is this whole area. 51 they
didn't even admit it existed until,

2537
02:21:29,181 --> 02:21:33,620
I believe it was the 90s when they wanted
to spread the amount of land that they

2538
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:36,950
controlled and was top secret because
too many people were getting close and

2539
02:21:36,951 --> 02:21:38,060
they were taking videos,

2540
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:41,240
taking videos of what looks like
Ufo shows what it looks like.

2541
02:21:41,241 --> 02:21:45,380
Most likely unmanned drones flying through
the night air and dancing and doing

2542
02:21:45,381 --> 02:21:47,520
shit that we could never do on
a fucking airplane. She lifting.

2543
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:51,850
There's a lot at JFK video
shit. A lot of it. No,

2544
02:21:51,930 --> 02:21:54,620
but once they start using it
though it makes the news. But dude,

2545
02:21:54,621 --> 02:21:58,670
they had to say that it existed in order
to get this extra land before that they

2546
02:21:58,671 --> 02:22:02,960
deny it as its existence. There was
no satellite Google earth back then,

2547
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:07,280
so you couldn't say, show me what's going
on in in the Nevada desert, you know,

2548
02:22:07,281 --> 02:22:11,060
and then boom, you tune into like
a couple hours outside of Vegas.

2549
02:22:11,090 --> 02:22:14,840
There's this crazy fucking place called
groom lake and this is like a dried up

2550
02:22:14,841 --> 02:22:17,930
lake bed and the government is
fucking testing Ufo shows out there.

2551
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:21,520
You know whatever Ufo is,
you know stealth bomber to me it looks,

2552
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:24,680
I've seen them in real life.
It ever was Edwards Air Force Base.

2553
02:22:24,681 --> 02:22:25,980
We were filming factor out there.

2554
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:30,050
That's a fucking Ufo man is black wing
thing flying over your head. That's,

2555
02:22:30,230 --> 02:22:33,900
that's like right out of star wars,
you know, does is allowed at all.

2556
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:39,150
It was like any regular jet. It wasn't
unusually loud. It was far enough away.

2557
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:42,540
It wasn't like right over my head
where it was like blood coming in low.

2558
02:22:42,650 --> 02:22:44,250
You know we were in Palm Dale Edwards.

2559
02:22:44,251 --> 02:22:46,680
Air Force base is like a little
bit outside of it. But you did get,

2560
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:51,840
what makes the UFO awesome is it applies
super fast from middle of nowhere.

2561
02:22:51,841 --> 02:22:55,860
Like it just stop.
Like what makes you go that's Ufo is not,

2562
02:22:55,890 --> 02:22:57,900
it's flying and it sounds like a jet.

2563
02:22:57,930 --> 02:23:01,980
It's like the hummingbird shit
everywhere. And I, you know,

2564
02:23:01,981 --> 02:23:05,670
I always feed the lights in the sky
stuff and what we can't figure it out.

2565
02:23:05,671 --> 02:23:08,580
But like I feel like we can't
figure it out right now.

2566
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:11,370
If somebody doesn't want us to know,
they're really not going to let us know.

2567
02:23:11,371 --> 02:23:12,204
I don't know what's,

2568
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:17,780
I know you're really pumped on foot area
51 but I'm like well if we can't know

2569
02:23:18,241 --> 02:23:21,640
if they're going to tell us fuck
you, what can we really say? They're,

2570
02:23:21,650 --> 02:23:23,580
they're in charge.
It's a sexy idea.

2571
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:25,350
It's something that's
fun and just keep around.

2572
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:29,400
So the idea of Ufos and aliens,
Dude,

2573
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:31,370
according to Dr Robert Alizar,

2574
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:35,400
they tried to back engineer the
fucking craft and they couldn't. Man,

2575
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:37,470
we don't have that element on earth.

2576
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:39,810
It establishes without
beyond a reasonable doubt,

2577
02:23:39,811 --> 02:23:42,680
it's from another planet and their
dicks get hard with Geek knowledge.

2578
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:47,990
They just want it to be an alien as fast.
I don't get it though. I'm just like,

2579
02:23:47,991 --> 02:23:51,210
all right cool cause the alien. I can't
wait bro, cause I want to play with them.

2580
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:53,050
You know what I'm saying?
Like I want to see these things.

2581
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:56,670
These guys just as fascinating to me
when something manmade does just as

2582
02:23:56,671 --> 02:24:00,400
fascinating too.
I think that's all it more for sure.

2583
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:04,770
Because to me the fact that scientists
stood on top of scientists shoulders for

2584
02:24:04,771 --> 02:24:07,620
generations because it shit I
can't even understand. You know,

2585
02:24:07,690 --> 02:24:11,400
they just stood on top of each other
shoulder for generation read on this geeky

2586
02:24:11,401 --> 02:24:14,070
stuff that I don't have the
chance to read our bitten,

2587
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:19,280
didn't let myself read like and then built
this or cure disease or that's crazy.

2588
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:26,130
That's a beautiful big, to me that's
like the most important thing in society.

2589
02:24:26,131 --> 02:24:29,880
Like we should be really rewarding that
cause that's what's going to push us

2590
02:24:29,881 --> 02:24:34,440
forward. That's what you know. You
know what I'm saying? Exactly. Exactly.

2591
02:24:34,441 --> 02:24:39,330
Read bad. You got to do my white crew that
that's how much I love technology. Yes,

2592
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:44,220
technology is awesome. I agree. Right?
Well that was the hard to sell you on.

2593
02:24:44,550 --> 02:24:49,020
I sorry Joe Rogan.
I didn't talk you up.

2594
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:50,720
What kind of crazy?
A shitty,

2595
02:24:50,721 --> 02:24:53,070
you incorporate it into training now
cause I know that you're always at the

2596
02:24:53,071 --> 02:24:56,760
fucking the front of the line
when it comes to technology.

2597
02:24:56,830 --> 02:25:01,170
Every UFC we come back with a
couple of new drills for next week.

2598
02:25:01,171 --> 02:25:03,330
Like what's good,
what's high in the streets?

2599
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:06,570
Shapes of the face or certain positions.

2600
02:25:06,571 --> 02:25:09,030
Like someone does something to go in
a minute that's there all the time.

2601
02:25:09,031 --> 02:25:11,670
And then you develop drills based
around that leads into like,

2602
02:25:11,671 --> 02:25:13,980
we started our whole ground and
pen stuff started like that.

2603
02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:18,830
Do you know the baby arm
of my pants?

2604
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:23,420
What are you talking about? Baby
arm. It's the weirdest videos.

2605
02:25:24,320 --> 02:25:29,180
What's Tim Boetsch fought? Uh,
this past weekend, he fought, um,

2606
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:32,680
nick ring and he had him in this position.

2607
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:34,240
There's a position when
you're in side control,

2608
02:25:34,241 --> 02:25:38,140
when you're facing the guy's legs and
you got his leg or his arm rather wrapped

2609
02:25:38,141 --> 02:25:40,420
up in between your legs, you
know, that mounted crucifix.

2610
02:25:40,460 --> 02:25:44,710
Everybody likes to do it sideways. We sit
sideways in your face towards his, uh,

2611
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:46,450
his, uh, legs and he grabbed his arm.

2612
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:50,280
His arm is in between your legs like a
giant Dick called the baby arm that just

2613
02:25:50,290 --> 02:25:52,600
grab his wrist and you can break his arm.
It's right there.

2614
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:55,660
It's right there on everybody. Nobody
does it. They just hold onto the arm,

2615
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:57,070
but if you just grabbed that wrist,

2616
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:59,560
you can completely control it
and you can just snap his elbow.

2617
02:25:59,561 --> 02:26:03,850
There's a tremendous amount of force in
that crazy leverage or show it to you.

2618
02:26:03,851 --> 02:26:08,110
Yeah. I want to show both his fight.
It's a John Jacques Machado move.

2619
02:26:08,111 --> 02:26:12,190
He invented it. Old School. It's old
school. You don't call it the baby arm.

2620
02:26:12,490 --> 02:26:15,270
He didn't call it the baby arm, but that's
Eddie Bravo named the baby. Of course,

2621
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:18,040
John Talks like here from here to here,
I have his wrist.

2622
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:22,220
This isn't on bar right here.
She dead easy.

2623
02:26:23,830 --> 02:26:26,560
I resilience have the coolest
accidents of all time.

2624
02:26:26,561 --> 02:26:30,220
I feel like the new up and coming kids
I feel like are not getting the really

2625
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:33,490
the real experience of having
a Brazilian coach, right?

2626
02:26:33,630 --> 02:26:38,200
There's plenty act who barely speaks
English. The base. Look, look, look,

2627
02:26:38,201 --> 02:26:42,880
look for me. Book for me here. This was
the ish right here. Not Good. Not Good.

2628
02:26:42,881 --> 02:26:46,930
His time. He's something. No good. Push me
away. Push. We were push me where? Okay.

2629
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:50,680
None that. Not that. Okay. I had it.

2630
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:53,300
I had a viral,
it's called Jack Rave.

2631
02:26:53,310 --> 02:26:55,710
I pricked the coach for
Becker a day like that.

2632
02:26:55,770 --> 02:26:57,700
God gave me a Geeky and I was like,
Dang.

2633
02:26:57,700 --> 02:27:01,120
And it was so old and cross the other day.
Damn coach man,

2634
02:27:01,121 --> 02:27:04,930
like this is real math.
He's like Jeff Leatham.

2635
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:10,000
When you get a horse for a presidency,
you don't watch his teeth. And I was like,

2636
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:14,530
what? What the hell does that
mean? I don't even understand. Oh,

2637
02:27:14,590 --> 02:27:18,490
you get a hole or a gift horse. You don't
look at it in a mouth. Oh, I get it.

2638
02:27:18,491 --> 02:27:20,020
You don't want to eat.

2639
02:27:21,390 --> 02:27:24,510
I took classes at our Carlson
Gracie's and crossing,

2640
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:27,250
didn't even speak English at
all. Oh, really? Didn't even try.

2641
02:27:27,490 --> 02:27:29,830
He would talk in Portuguese
and then Sergio Colon,

2642
02:27:29,831 --> 02:27:34,030
a dude who barely spoke English would then
give you, destroy your instruction. Aw.

2643
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:35,650
So that's even better.

2644
02:27:35,710 --> 02:27:38,560
Or who we talked to John Awano and
John Juanelle speaks perfect English.

2645
02:27:40,570 --> 02:27:43,840
I wouldn't, you know what? I want to just
get a do to translate all my coaching.

2646
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:49,030
Talking gibberish like does not like just
yelling and screaming and Ryan will be

2647
02:27:49,031 --> 02:27:51,730
like, he guys, he wants
to uh, to go front.

2648
02:27:51,731 --> 02:27:55,030
Headlocks right now you're like frustrated
when you hear certain dudes coaching.

2649
02:27:55,031 --> 02:27:59,290
Do you get frustrated with,
is it like Comedians, like
judge other comedians? Like,

2650
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:04,000
Oh God, you went there. Yeah, some hack.
Shit. I'd like to say that didn't happen,

2651
02:28:04,001 --> 02:28:07,180
but probably some bro.
Dude. For your family. Yeah.

2652
02:28:07,181 --> 02:28:09,820
We ate all your folders by Brian.
Tell the truth.

2653
02:28:11,810 --> 02:28:15,430
If a guy has stupid coaching, we
do make fun of up, don't we? Yeah.

2654
02:28:15,431 --> 02:28:18,560
But that being said, I've said some dumb
stuff too. You know who my favorite guys,

2655
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:22,130
my favorite guys to listen
to a as coaches, the English

2656
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:26,830
dudes get the fucking,
they yell and scream and they do coaches.

2657
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:29,710
I hope they're the same guys.

2658
02:28:29,990 --> 02:28:32,780
The Wolf's lair is

2659
02:28:37,790 --> 02:28:40,490
such an awesome acts. The English
accent is one of my favorite all time.

2660
02:28:41,390 --> 02:28:43,850
That's why we use it for infomercials
when they were trying to sell something

2661
02:28:43,851 --> 02:28:44,684
important,

2662
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:48,140
they use an English accent because the
English accents like fucking legit man,

2663
02:28:48,141 --> 02:28:49,790
this is some serious fly fishing line.

2664
02:28:49,791 --> 02:28:54,791
I'm telling you the fly fishing line
all bit better than I'll ever meet the

2665
02:28:55,431 --> 02:28:58,850
highest quality brass hook.
Maybe that was a cue for something,

2666
02:28:58,851 --> 02:29:01,250
maybe that they rehearsed something
that in the gym it closed.

2667
02:29:01,251 --> 02:29:03,110
The distance means yeah,

2668
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:07,000
do now we're going to a free,
he does.

2669
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:10,420
He does a baby are,
and we do that sometimes.

2670
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:15,450
So that's to say maybe there was spot on
and well rampage is so fucking talented

2671
02:29:15,651 --> 02:29:19,280
physically, but it's just so, you know,
everyone knows what he's going to do,

2672
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:22,430
you know, and me and he'd be gets you.
You're fucked. If he gets a hold of you,

2673
02:29:22,580 --> 02:29:24,770
he puts those hands on you.
He could put it on anybody.

2674
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:27,760
Rampage can put on anybody.
If you fuck up and you know you,

2675
02:29:27,761 --> 02:29:30,770
you let him get into his game and
and get ahold of you, you're done.

2676
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:32,360
But Jon Jones,
man,

2677
02:29:32,361 --> 02:29:35,630
he figured out how to definitely not
let rampage fight as game. I mean,

2678
02:29:35,631 --> 02:29:37,880
that's what it was. It was rampage
flight. Jon Jones, his game,

2679
02:29:37,881 --> 02:29:41,300
he had a perfect fucking game plan
for his body and rampage. The style.

2680
02:29:41,690 --> 02:29:44,090
It's amazing to watch.
Wasn't that beautiful?

2681
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:47,600
Does that inspire the fuck out of you
when you see shit like that? Yeah,

2682
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:50,030
of course. I, you know, and
I felt like, uh, you know,

2683
02:29:50,090 --> 02:29:54,190
Jon Jones could it like a great job of
his gay plan and sticking to it and then

2684
02:29:54,260 --> 02:29:58,610
he took rampage out of his game plan
and didn't let ramp Hayes do what he was

2685
02:29:58,611 --> 02:30:01,880
good at. Do you know? It's great.
It was cool to watch that man.

2686
02:30:01,881 --> 02:30:05,240
It was like amazing. Amazing that he's
been able to do that so quick. You know,

2687
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:08,350
it's fun to watch his evolution.
It's weird right now.

2688
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:11,900
Who the fuck has ever gotten that
good that quick, you know? Nah. Yeah.

2689
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:13,880
I mean that makes sense.
Let me, Stephan Bonner was,

2690
02:30:13,881 --> 02:30:17,390
what was that two years ago or
something like that? Was it even,

2691
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:19,700
was it even two years ago? I
don't know. I'm just guessing.

2692
02:30:19,701 --> 02:30:22,100
I'm not going to go to search short
org and check it out. But you know,

2693
02:30:22,101 --> 02:30:25,280
when you're thinking about the
start fighting in 2008 yeah.

2694
02:30:25,281 --> 02:30:27,890
And when did he get to the UFC?
In 2009.

2695
02:30:28,070 --> 02:30:30,350
It was like nine months
later he had like six fights,

2696
02:30:30,351 --> 02:30:33,230
but they were fought really close.
It's amazing. So on another,

2697
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:36,200
it's amazing when you watch it every now
and there's some dude who come along in

2698
02:30:36,201 --> 02:30:39,320
any sport where you just go,
Whoa, what the fuck? You know,

2699
02:30:39,350 --> 02:30:43,670
someone all of a sudden just jumps way
ahead of the Line Bay, you know, thick.

2700
02:30:44,030 --> 02:30:47,570
It's like a genetic mutation.
Yeah. When he beat up shogun dude,

2701
02:30:47,690 --> 02:30:52,280
that was literally like if you
were from another planet, okay.

2702
02:30:52,310 --> 02:30:57,050
And you, you came in and you
were watching these, uh, these,

2703
02:30:57,051 --> 02:31:00,140
these species, he would say, oh,
this is interspecies comeback.

2704
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:04,070
This is one species going up against
another specie. Oh, this, this,

2705
02:31:04,071 --> 02:31:07,310
this shogun specie. This really can't
fuck with this other thing. Like,

2706
02:31:07,311 --> 02:31:07,971
why is he doing that?

2707
02:31:07,971 --> 02:31:11,660
That's like sort of like a grasshopper
fucking with a praying Mantis,

2708
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:15,230
you know what I mean? You mean it would
have like two different things. You know,

2709
02:31:15,231 --> 02:31:16,130
I'm looking at Shogun,

2710
02:31:16,131 --> 02:31:18,080
the way he throws his punches
and the way he throws his kicks.

2711
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:20,730
It's a guy who's got a an
arm that goes this long,

2712
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:25,290
but when you've got an arm that goes
way the fuck across the room and it's

2713
02:31:25,291 --> 02:31:28,710
attached to a body that spent a lifetime
learning how to manipulate other

2714
02:31:28,711 --> 02:31:31,650
people's bodies and control them
and throw them around and wrestling.

2715
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:36,230
It's literally a two different species,
you know? But it's fucking giant.

2716
02:31:36,270 --> 02:31:40,470
84 inch wingspan. Yeah, it is like
two different things. You go like,

2717
02:31:40,471 --> 02:31:44,070
well this is one thing. I guess they
could breed and they could have a child,

2718
02:31:44,071 --> 02:31:45,700
but really the different,
so you're, you're,

2719
02:31:45,701 --> 02:31:50,110
you're proposing the show got a judge
Jones bone? No repurposing that.

2720
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:53,040
If we mixed up a female Shogun,

2721
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:57,990
what do you think of this Chaz Bono
picture where she's walking around with no

2722
02:31:57,991 --> 02:32:02,070
shirt on? This is what I say. Oh wait,
where's that? She walks around outside.

2723
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:07,170
It's hot out. So she's got these giant
scars where she used to have breasts,

2724
02:32:07,171 --> 02:32:10,980
so she had a breast meat removed and
now she's just flat chested but with a

2725
02:32:10,981 --> 02:32:14,260
woman's nipple. But she'd like belly.
She got like a lot of there. She's got a,

2726
02:32:14,261 --> 02:32:17,370
he's a footy game about Nancy
Grace's Nipper oh, shot.

2727
02:32:17,380 --> 02:32:20,900
That's all I was picking about the whole
entire time we were talking about this

2728
02:32:21,390 --> 02:32:22,310
bad thing.
Hello?

2729
02:32:22,380 --> 02:32:27,330
How Nancy Grace boobs stole the
tradies thunder by like, what the hell?

2730
02:32:28,540 --> 02:32:32,760
No, I don't even know what the big deal
is. I don't think of it as a trainee.

2731
02:32:32,761 --> 02:32:37,100
It's right when it's a girl. That term
becomes a guy. So she got to grow. I mean,

2732
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:38,820
let she know what to the picture.

2733
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:42,510
Just walking around that's
not even worth looking at.

2734
02:32:42,570 --> 02:32:47,090
So she's got a beard down.
I said, dude, you know, uh,

2735
02:32:47,330 --> 02:32:51,030
nipples. I don't know, man. I think
transgender people get a bad rap. I think,

2736
02:32:51,031 --> 02:32:53,790
you know, do whatever you want to do,
man. As long as that makes you happy,

2737
02:32:53,791 --> 02:32:58,080
if they're really does. However, I think
it's strange, the nipple thing that,

2738
02:32:58,260 --> 02:32:59,670
that's a real legit news source.

2739
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:03,450
You would never be able to show a
photo of a woman's nipple before,

2740
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:07,740
but because she has committed to the life
of a man now you could see her nipple.

2741
02:33:07,770 --> 02:33:11,100
That is what I found fascinating.
I think in America in general,

2742
02:33:11,101 --> 02:33:15,960
people just need to get over sex anyway.
Like I feel like it's like you make it,

2743
02:33:15,961 --> 02:33:20,730
you make it this scary dirty thing and
then show some titties on TV. Who Cares?

2744
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:21,970
It's not going to,
you know,

2745
02:33:22,210 --> 02:33:25,260
I'm not going to send society
crashing down and burning.

2746
02:33:25,440 --> 02:33:27,780
I think people are worried
about people going nutty.

2747
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:30,960
They're worried about people not
doing their share, not doing work,

2748
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:33,030
not helping build up society.

2749
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:36,690
And they think that one of the ways to
make sure and ensure that society keeps

2750
02:33:36,691 --> 02:33:39,960
moving at a good pace is to
control the sucks. What? Why?

2751
02:33:39,961 --> 02:33:43,110
Cause rolled the freak animal instinct
in people control the violence and

2752
02:33:43,111 --> 02:33:46,590
control the sex cause other, those are
the things that you most terrified about.

2753
02:33:46,770 --> 02:33:48,570
When the barbarian storm the gates,

2754
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:52,580
you're not worried that they're going
to fucking take your basketball and now

2755
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:55,810
they're worried you're going to fuck your
women and take your money. Why? Well,

2756
02:33:57,390 --> 02:34:00,360
I don't control. They couldn't try
and control sex and control violence.

2757
02:34:00,510 --> 02:34:03,910
Those are two things people try to
control when they want to keep society in

2758
02:34:03,911 --> 02:34:07,170
order. They tried to control sex
and control violence. Really?

2759
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:09,570
I'd never thought about it that
way. Well that's, you know,

2760
02:34:09,571 --> 02:34:11,310
it's normal for people to want like,

2761
02:34:11,370 --> 02:34:14,520
oh look at these slots and these horrors
and I don't want to strip club near me.

2762
02:34:14,521 --> 02:34:17,620
You know, you have a whorehouse
in your town. What's, you know,

2763
02:34:17,621 --> 02:34:19,560
there's a natural inclination of what?
Why?

2764
02:34:19,561 --> 02:34:22,090
Why do you care if you're not fucking
these whores and why do you care while,

2765
02:34:22,091 --> 02:34:24,220
cause you don't want people near
you that are fucking these whores.

2766
02:34:24,221 --> 02:34:27,780
You don't want people in your neighborhood
then want to fuck these whores. Yeah,

2767
02:34:27,790 --> 02:34:29,170
but it's happening, right? Yeah.

2768
02:34:29,171 --> 02:34:33,580
But it's a natural inclination for
people to try to shy away from the most

2769
02:34:33,581 --> 02:34:35,530
frightening of our instincts there.

2770
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:40,120
Our desire to want to fuck and a desire
to want to kill. Right. I guess so.

2771
02:34:40,121 --> 02:34:42,560
I guess you're right. I've never
really come to society. You,

2772
02:34:42,561 --> 02:34:44,740
your society for a young man
like you is like, you know,

2773
02:34:44,741 --> 02:34:46,780
might as well be Vegas all day,
you know,

2774
02:34:46,810 --> 02:34:51,810
but for the society to work in order for
people to show up at the wonder bread

2775
02:34:52,181 --> 02:34:53,770
factory,
you know,

2776
02:34:53,771 --> 02:34:58,270
in order for society to move and you
can't give it out and jobs at Starbucks.

2777
02:34:58,300 --> 02:35:01,180
I get where you're saying okay. He, yeah,

2778
02:35:01,181 --> 02:35:04,240
when you look at countries that are
more liberal, I wonder what their, uh,

2779
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:07,110
their output is, their gross
domestic output or their, you know,

2780
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:11,020
how well it was just like,
yeah, you go to Starbucks,

2781
02:35:11,021 --> 02:35:13,840
get a handy like overall
it's like, it's like, yeah,

2782
02:35:13,841 --> 02:35:17,470
it's like the society has
accepted like men, like in the,

2783
02:35:17,670 --> 02:35:20,920
in the sports pages
there's like naked chicks.

2784
02:35:20,950 --> 02:35:25,570
Like it's like whatever Lailey so you
can go and just get service somewhere.

2785
02:35:25,571 --> 02:35:26,404
In Japan

2786
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:27,241
he is,
yeah,

2787
02:35:27,241 --> 02:35:31,920
I think you could just land places you
can go get jack on and it's like normal.

2788
02:35:31,921 --> 02:35:35,790
Like the guy bought him any,
any massage parlor.

2789
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:40,020
But here it's so demonized.
Sometimes dudes do that.

2790
02:35:40,320 --> 02:35:44,180
The Broncos are legal and they're um,
about an hour. They as productive usage.

2791
02:35:44,190 --> 02:35:47,370
Japanese are more productive than
Americans. More desirable. Yeah, man.

2792
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:49,200
And yet they can still
get jerked off places.

2793
02:35:49,201 --> 02:35:52,770
So that throws my theory to the delta.
Yeah. Totally crushes your theory.

2794
02:35:52,771 --> 02:35:57,640
That's why I was thinking about in
order to be creative. Hmm. Tom Man.

2795
02:35:57,770 --> 02:36:01,350
I think it just societal,
societal appropriately. Yeah.

2796
02:36:01,850 --> 02:36:04,200
It's like it might be, but why? How come,

2797
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:09,260
why does Japan like really love America?
Why does,

2798
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:11,130
why does so many Japanese?
Well, I'm not a lot of American

2799
02:36:11,130 --> 02:36:12,360
skin's really loved Japan as well.

2800
02:36:12,390 --> 02:36:15,860
I don't think they do it take a lot
of the music. Yeah. It's not dude.

2801
02:36:15,870 --> 02:36:18,940
There's a lot of people that are like
really get into American music over there

2802
02:36:19,010 --> 02:36:21,220
cause their music sucks so
bad. Is that what it is? Yeah.

2803
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:24,660
I mean if you look at any country, like
most countries, music aren't there.

2804
02:36:24,690 --> 02:36:28,050
It's not as good as the United States.
Japan had his own grief.

2805
02:36:28,850 --> 02:36:29,990
You don't know what you're talking about.

2806
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:34,140
I just talked to somebody the other day
that that went to Jab Japan probably

2807
02:36:34,141 --> 02:36:36,360
like 10 times and that's what
they were telling me this,

2808
02:36:36,361 --> 02:36:37,500
that's why I brought it up.

2809
02:36:37,790 --> 02:36:42,480
And every time they go there I I been
oil is American music or their version of

2810
02:36:42,481 --> 02:36:45,420
an old dude. I'm saying if
there's, okay so your country,

2811
02:36:45,421 --> 02:36:49,320
okay it's pretty bad ass and it makes
like a like good music and whatever.

2812
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:54,090
But then another country who's budget is
way fucking bigger I think got crazier

2813
02:36:54,091 --> 02:36:57,270
acts of whatever crazy reveal affects
of course you're going to watch some of

2814
02:36:57,271 --> 02:37:00,270
that is not going to
totally be fuck America.

2815
02:37:00,700 --> 02:37:04,090
I was actually trying to get at the reason
why I was saying it is because I was

2816
02:37:04,091 --> 02:37:07,880
wondering what effect their, their
discipline and their, their, their,

2817
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:10,690
you know the fact that they can get
laid and just get serviced with,

2818
02:37:10,700 --> 02:37:12,820
I wonder what that has
effect on their creativity.

2819
02:37:12,970 --> 02:37:16,100
Like the art day produced the music
that they make and I was like well why

2820
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:19,280
do they like American music so much?
Is it, what is their music light?

2821
02:37:19,281 --> 02:37:21,170
Cause did they have like
really good music in Japan?

2822
02:37:21,171 --> 02:37:23,370
Is Japan like a dope ass Rockville,

2823
02:37:24,340 --> 02:37:26,450
j o j pop they or something like,
yeah,

2824
02:37:26,451 --> 02:37:29,840
there's different styles of
music like pop music, you know,

2825
02:37:29,841 --> 02:37:33,480
getting even one Japanese
artists right now named one that

2826
02:37:35,370 --> 02:37:37,160
you asked him,
name one American artists,

2827
02:37:37,161 --> 02:37:41,750
they know 50 well that's what I'm saying,
the dominant culture in the world.

2828
02:37:41,800 --> 02:37:46,010
A small island, they're not yet, but you
shouldn't even be able to no one. Oh Man.

2829
02:37:46,011 --> 02:37:48,230
God, because you don't
listen to Japanese music.

2830
02:37:48,231 --> 02:37:49,940
You don't understand the Japanese.
What I'm saying?

2831
02:37:51,140 --> 02:37:55,820
That's why they have no one's saying was
the singer. He's the best. Well yeah.

2832
02:37:55,821 --> 02:37:58,400
I mean I don't know though.
It's also a different language.

2833
02:37:58,401 --> 02:37:59,870
I mean we're not really interested in,

2834
02:37:59,871 --> 02:38:03,830
everybody in Japan speaks English a
little bit. Everybody speaks a little bit.

2835
02:38:03,831 --> 02:38:04,664
Everyone in Japan,

2836
02:38:04,850 --> 02:38:08,240
just about why a lot of people won't do
it because they feel embarrassed about

2837
02:38:08,241 --> 02:38:10,610
it. But everyone learns it
in school. So to an tech,

2838
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:13,730
well maybe Japan because it's not
trying to take over the world anymore.

2839
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:18,500
Maybe they've spent more time sort
of evolving as a culture like and uh,

2840
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:22,300
you know, just progressing, you know,
business wise and discipline wise, no,

2841
02:38:22,301 --> 02:38:26,370
but I think for years and years it's been
just like that and people aren't just

2842
02:38:26,470 --> 02:38:29,510
like what? It's been like
that there's been a culture.

2843
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:33,950
It's their culture back that whole
Geisha, Geisha before that even, you know,

2844
02:38:33,951 --> 02:38:37,760
and people had a normal, that was their
thing. Oh, I got a concubine. What's up?

2845
02:38:37,761 --> 02:38:40,880
That whole society's
patient, calm, conforming,

2846
02:38:41,250 --> 02:38:44,600
[inaudible] everyone dresses in the same
black suits. They do the same things.

2847
02:38:44,601 --> 02:38:45,680
They follow the same path.

2848
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,920
Stepping outside of theF is really
frowned upon really front of mind.

2849
02:38:48,930 --> 02:38:52,910
You've got to be part of the team. Like
the team is smart, here's the rules,

2850
02:38:52,911 --> 02:38:56,420
do the rules. It's awesome. It's
fascinating. I think it's great.

2851
02:38:56,421 --> 02:39:00,710
I think people could adapt some of those
cultural Biggs from Japan and bringing

2852
02:39:00,711 --> 02:39:03,320
it here to him as possible.
It's very difficult.

2853
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:07,160
Generations and generations now. How
do you think they want them doing that?

2854
02:39:07,161 --> 02:39:10,540
That's what it always been fast.
It was such a small amount of area of it.

2855
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:14,540
So many people living in it, so they had
to be more disciplined. You eventually,

2856
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:16,900
you got that way, you
became that way. Like,

2857
02:39:17,010 --> 02:39:20,210
because you know you do the
right even at Mcdonald's, man,

2858
02:39:20,240 --> 02:39:23,600
like they do the right job because
that's the right thing to do.

2859
02:39:23,630 --> 02:39:26,960
Don't get me wrong, there's stupid people
there. They can't help but they're dumb.

2860
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:30,080
But they tried to do their job
as best as they can, you know?

2861
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:32,000
And I feel like we could
bring that to America.

2862
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:37,040
Just do your job like as best you can,
whatever your job is, do it awesome.

2863
02:39:37,070 --> 02:39:39,440
Like just try your hardest,
you know?

2864
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:41,900
And I mean really that's
what you're trying to do.

2865
02:39:42,030 --> 02:39:44,750
That's what you should be trying to do.
But I think in America people are like,

2866
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:49,220
oh, everyone owes me something. You know
what I mean? Like I should, you know,

2867
02:39:49,370 --> 02:39:52,790
I should get paid more. Like, no,
you shouldn't. You should just work.

2868
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:56,960
You should just do what you have to do
and do it. Awesome. Because it's your job.

2869
02:39:57,020 --> 02:39:59,970
Jason Mayhem, Miller corporate
employer. I'm just saying, no,

2870
02:39:59,990 --> 02:40:03,830
no pep speech of the weak boys
took away your life insurance.

2871
02:40:03,831 --> 02:40:05,660
But I've got words of wisdom,
right.

2872
02:40:06,740 --> 02:40:11,300
You should just fucking work hard like
a wave. You got to do it. Do it hard.

2873
02:40:11,301 --> 02:40:14,240
Like do it as best you can.
Wait

2874
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:17,040
for their back. I'd look at that.
Look at guns, germs and steel.

2875
02:40:17,041 --> 02:40:20,910
We talk about this book all the time.
Book ever. Yeah. How, just moving,

2876
02:40:20,911 --> 02:40:22,770
what geographic resources did you have in,

2877
02:40:22,771 --> 02:40:26,460
how did that affect how your
culture develops and the
Maori people with the best

2878
02:40:26,730 --> 02:40:29,460
in New Zealand, they fought all the
time cause they had lots of resources.

2879
02:40:29,490 --> 02:40:33,240
You could afford to have a priest to teach
her, uh, you know, just a home, whatever.

2880
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:37,320
As soon as a group of those Maori people
move to an island, 400 miles south,

2881
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:39,690
everyone had to spend
all day gathering food.

2882
02:40:39,691 --> 02:40:41,550
They had to work together
and you couldn't fight.

2883
02:40:42,170 --> 02:40:46,550
So they turned almost like this into a
peaceful culture. Sure. Not several year.

2884
02:40:46,551 --> 02:40:49,110
A hundred years later, the Mallory
come, they find them. What do they do?

2885
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:52,350
They kill all, they're like the same
people. They're basically cousins,

2886
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:56,250
pick them up, but we're the island
they went to has very few resources.

2887
02:40:56,250 --> 02:41:00,870
They had to spent all day gathering food
to eat a bunch of food in my house and

2888
02:41:00,871 --> 02:41:04,180
I can listen to him be appraised
so that I can go to a dot weekend.

2889
02:41:04,181 --> 02:41:06,240
I've spent it. We can have a
warrior's, we can have teachers.

2890
02:41:06,241 --> 02:41:11,030
All these specializations change a
society based on resource or resources or

2891
02:41:11,031 --> 02:41:14,610
their large grains that you could make.
Did you have domesticated animals?

2892
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:17,280
Look at all that stuff.
Starting in a few regions.

2893
02:41:17,490 --> 02:41:19,740
Go try to domesticate a giraffe.

2894
02:41:20,010 --> 02:41:23,880
I do it with a goat.
I've got to last all that big.

2895
02:41:24,090 --> 02:41:27,450
Then all of a sudden with those animals,
you can live near them, so your diseases,

2896
02:41:27,451 --> 02:41:30,120
your immune system grows stronger.
You can make food.

2897
02:41:30,121 --> 02:41:32,520
You have surplus food and read this book.
I haven't read it.

2898
02:41:32,521 --> 02:41:34,650
It's the best GM hearing.
I haven't read it,

2899
02:41:34,651 --> 02:41:38,280
so that means it's been recommended
to me like blow your mind.

2900
02:41:38,930 --> 02:41:42,600
I'm going to get it on Amazon right now.
All right, good. Good. Yeah, I think go.

2901
02:41:42,650 --> 02:41:45,890
I don't, I don't remember the
whole Japanese part of a bed.

2902
02:41:45,891 --> 02:41:48,420
Be Interesting to watch the ancient
aliens the other night where they were

2903
02:41:48,421 --> 02:41:51,870
trying to say that Japanese
Samurai swords, they were
talking to them by aliens.

2904
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:57,060
Awesome. No one could have figured out
a way to make this steel like this.

2905
02:41:57,061 --> 02:42:01,860
They were talking about develop
the ability to fucking folds.

2906
02:42:03,570 --> 02:42:07,690
Samurai sued given to me
by ass freaking alien dude.

2907
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:11,970
It was glow in the dark. It that'd be
like four Chan Chan's been doing with him.

2908
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:17,410
They've been having huge photo threads
of the guy felt aliens like his hair and

2909
02:42:18,871 --> 02:42:21,780
stuff and they're just like making him
like all these different characters like

2910
02:42:21,781 --> 02:42:25,890
it's so fucking, I love websites. So
funny. I want to get all four term.

2911
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:30,380
I always hear about it. I never go
on it from Starbucks. Buy Now what?

2912
02:42:30,450 --> 02:42:34,830
One click sudden Bam a bought a gun.
Germs and steel.

2913
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:38,370
I'll try to read it in the next time
you're on the podcast can bring that shit.

2914
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,650
Yeah, it's out of your work. You
know what? Actually the first half.

2915
02:42:43,651 --> 02:42:46,080
That book is pretty like
ball ball, ball, ball, ball.

2916
02:42:46,270 --> 02:42:48,960
Then it gets to be like work
like the second one. Yeah,

2917
02:42:48,961 --> 02:42:52,260
the second half you started
to be like, aw, Shit.

2918
02:42:52,261 --> 02:42:56,370
Like I got to read this back again. It
all gets a little complicated, but man,

2919
02:42:56,371 --> 02:42:59,660
overall like I'm sold. That's one
of the books I'm so glad I read.

2920
02:42:59,661 --> 02:43:03,540
It paints a beautiful picture on why did
Europeans come over to different places

2921
02:43:03,541 --> 02:43:05,790
in world, spread their journey.
You know, Columbus stuffed up,

2922
02:43:05,791 --> 02:43:08,050
the boat sneezed and
100 million people die.

2923
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:12,010
Why didn't Indians getting native
Americans here? Getting to canoes, come

2924
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:14,800
to Europe. In fact, this would their
diseases and shoot us with. Well,

2925
02:43:14,801 --> 02:43:17,440
there's a lot of people that believe that
people came here far earlier than that.

2926
02:43:17,470 --> 02:43:21,370
You know what the old Mex are and
a in Mexico and in South America,

2927
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:24,220
you ever heard the old macs? They
don't know what the fuck they are, man.

2928
02:43:24,310 --> 02:43:26,650
They don't know who they are,
where they have an African faces.

2929
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:30,070
They have African faces and these things
are thousands and thousands years old.

2930
02:43:30,071 --> 02:43:33,040
They believe at least 6,000 years old.
He's fucking structures,

2931
02:43:33,041 --> 02:43:36,670
which puts them more, what does
that 4,000, not even, yeah.

2932
02:43:36,700 --> 02:43:40,230
Well almost 4,000 BC. So they don't
know who the fuck these people were,

2933
02:43:40,231 --> 02:43:44,530
where they came from. Africa, they have
African faces on this big carved stones,

2934
02:43:44,531 --> 02:43:46,510
gigantic,
massive ones that these faces.

2935
02:43:46,690 --> 02:43:48,850
They don't have a language
attributed to these people.

2936
02:43:48,851 --> 02:43:52,480
They don't know anything about the
culture. Sorry, just what a mystery.

2937
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:57,040
So it's very likely that people were
traveling from, uh, from South America,

2938
02:43:57,460 --> 02:43:59,170
South America to Egypt.
In fact,

2939
02:43:59,171 --> 02:44:03,130
because they found cocaine in mummies
and they know the cocaine can only been

2940
02:44:03,131 --> 02:44:06,940
grown in South America and South America.
Whole Mormon faith belief though, right?

2941
02:44:07,090 --> 02:44:07,360
No,

2942
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:11,080
the Mormon faith believes that the lost
tribe of Israel came across the Bering

2943
02:44:11,081 --> 02:44:14,140
strait and they became
the American Indians. Uh,

2944
02:44:14,840 --> 02:44:18,380
I went thought that South America first,
they believe, well, maybe, I don't know.

2945
02:44:18,450 --> 02:44:20,710
They think that's how it was
described to me by a Mormon.

2946
02:44:20,711 --> 02:44:22,690
Is that somehow somewhere
in the Middle East,

2947
02:44:22,691 --> 02:44:26,230
they came to South America first and
populated the Americas from stem.

2948
02:44:26,980 --> 02:44:28,690
I haven't heard that one.
I thought what I heard,

2949
02:44:29,220 --> 02:44:30,850
maybe there's another
group that believes that,

2950
02:44:30,851 --> 02:44:33,700
but what's really funny is
one guy actually went and
got genetic testing because

2951
02:44:33,701 --> 02:44:36,010
he was a devout Mormon and he
really truly believes in it.

2952
02:44:36,250 --> 02:44:39,280
So went out and got the American Indians
tested cause he wanted to prove that

2953
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:41,460
they were Israeli. You know,
there were the lost tribes,

2954
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:45,130
but they were from Siberia.
They were from the Bering strait.

2955
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:49,050
They came from another country. They were
Indian. Well you don't need a damn test.

2956
02:44:49,051 --> 02:44:53,170
Look, look at to ask about,
I look at a Chinese person,

2957
02:44:54,350 --> 02:44:57,310
you're like, ah, there's gotta
be some damp connection. Yeah.

2958
02:44:57,311 --> 02:45:00,490
Russians look so much like American
Indians, you know, easy. Yeah.

2959
02:45:00,850 --> 02:45:02,830
Well there's the those,
you know, those people,

2960
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:06,340
it's really amazing when you stop and
think about it when you look at like how

2961
02:45:06,341 --> 02:45:09,350
Eskimos have lived, you know,
up until really recently,

2962
02:45:09,351 --> 02:45:12,970
I mean he's still sort of follow the
same sorta lives that they would have,

2963
02:45:12,971 --> 02:45:16,300
have to have followed hundreds
and hundreds of years ago
to stay alive. You know,

2964
02:45:16,301 --> 02:45:20,970
they still were skins, you know, they
still, they hunt seals, you know, it's,

2965
02:45:20,971 --> 02:45:25,330
it's kind of a amazing shit that they're
still able to eke out a life in a world

2966
02:45:25,331 --> 02:45:27,790
where you would be terrified to live.

2967
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:32,770
Could you imagine if we had to go and we
had a move to like northern Alaska and

2968
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:36,940
live forever with the Eskimos,
like Whoa,

2969
02:45:38,400 --> 02:45:42,220
that's a trivial at this point in your
life I would try my best question.

2970
02:45:42,280 --> 02:45:45,480
Good question. I would try
my best. I'll be like, fuck
it dude. Let's get out there.

2971
02:45:45,481 --> 02:45:46,780
Let's do some ice fishing.

2972
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:49,480
I though it'd be our first
thought like get some books, Bro.

2973
02:45:49,630 --> 02:45:53,350
I want to get some furry boots to the
real boots is where it's at the season.

2974
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:57,040
The real issue would be that you'd have
no choice and that you would probably

2975
02:45:57,041 --> 02:46:00,120
have to be working so hard
just to stay alive. Oh yeah.

2976
02:46:00,310 --> 02:46:02,860
That's where you must get
all of your enjoyment from,

2977
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,390
from fucking hunting and gathering.

2978
02:46:04,391 --> 02:46:06,640
Like you don't have no time
for no hobbies anymore. Dude.

2979
02:46:06,850 --> 02:46:09,560
If you're living up there and you're
just trying to bash seals over the head

2980
02:46:09,561 --> 02:46:13,420
every day and he was a reserve I think.

2981
02:46:14,030 --> 02:46:14,810
I think you would,

2982
02:46:14,810 --> 02:46:17,890
you would adapt just like any movie
like that Tom Hanks movie where you feel

2983
02:46:17,970 --> 02:46:21,170
like that's crazy.
You would adapt but you wouldn't enjoy it.

2984
02:46:21,350 --> 02:46:24,020
There's this weird life.
Could be this podcast life

2985
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:27,980
drink coconut juice.

2986
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:32,090
Thank you to CTO cause they sent me
some juice and stuff is the bomb diggity

2987
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:36,110
it's delicious but know what I mean?
Come on Jill Rowley.

2988
02:46:36,130 --> 02:46:39,860
It's super healthy for you. Yeah. Ryan
Parsons. Yeah it is right isn't it?

2989
02:46:39,890 --> 02:46:43,130
You're the health master. I'm know
about that but yeah, that's great.

2990
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:47,390
Do you still sell that life force stuff?
I do life force, right? Not Light Force

2991
02:46:49,170 --> 02:46:52,510
and then l I f f e is the Randy couture
version. I don't think that exists.

2992
02:46:52,511 --> 02:46:54,980
Say More, but I'm not sure. I
think, I think he has a different,

2993
02:46:54,981 --> 02:46:56,990
where did they get that light force?
Shit they got that stuff's good.

2994
02:46:56,990 --> 02:46:59,700
Light four screens. Dot. Everybody
was drinking that shit for a while.

2995
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:01,940
I can't give it.
I was drinking with my protein shake.

2996
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,620
It gives a look a little bit flare
to, yeah, that's what I do to a,

2997
02:47:04,621 --> 02:47:07,730
to then I also buy some,
there's a green superfood thing.

2998
02:47:08,490 --> 02:47:09,770
Powdered shit always put it in there,

2999
02:47:10,070 --> 02:47:11,960
but I don't know how
much that really helps.

3000
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:15,590
It doesn't ever seem to help as much as
the Vitamix when you really blend it up

3001
02:47:15,591 --> 02:47:20,591
like rocky now and will be a fresh juice
or at Vitamix juice I powder is dam can

3002
02:47:21,681 --> 02:47:24,830
be, it's good to travel and things
like an extra little boost. Do you,

3003
02:47:24,831 --> 02:47:28,100
I'm always feed your gut and make sure
you guys eat red meat or do you got,

3004
02:47:28,130 --> 02:47:30,380
do you guys eat chicken and fish?
Like what do you, do you uh,

3005
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:34,280
do you stop them from eating red meat?
What do you, what's your diet? To me,

3006
02:47:34,281 --> 02:47:37,280
I spent so much time on and it's a
subject that's really interesting and it's

3007
02:47:37,281 --> 02:47:42,281
super boring at the same time because
in 30 seconds you can learn 95% of

3008
02:47:42,621 --> 02:47:45,140
everything you need to know and
then you can argue about the rest.

3009
02:47:45,470 --> 02:47:50,150
So I think less, you know, red meat
is probably better. I got an idea.

3010
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:53,540
I think, uh, you supposed to eat
things that are hard to catch.

3011
02:47:53,990 --> 02:47:56,570
I think that's why fish is really good
for you and that's why dear is really

3012
02:47:56,571 --> 02:47:59,810
good for you and is really good for her
because they're out there running and

3013
02:47:59,811 --> 02:48:02,630
trying to get away. It's so
different than anything. Farmer.

3014
02:48:02,810 --> 02:48:05,690
Super good flights are good. Yeah, super
good for you. That's what I'm saying.

3015
02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:08,500
Essential fatty acid profiles are
totally different than that profile.

3016
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:13,240
Everything is better for you.
Chickens that fight back like that.

3017
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:16,910
That's it. There's a big fat plump
ones with a juicy breasts. The,

3018
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:20,600
their breasts are so big to fall forward
and fucking face plant everywhere they

3019
02:48:20,601 --> 02:48:24,530
go. You ever seen those? Those are
American chickens, Jack. That's crazy.

3020
02:48:24,540 --> 02:48:26,730
Then when they get there real quick,
you know,

3021
02:48:26,750 --> 02:48:29,240
they're trying to take a chicken and
there's, there's ideas of chicken,

3022
02:48:29,241 --> 02:48:31,520
a chicken and turn into a dinosaur.
Like they,

3023
02:48:31,521 --> 02:48:34,400
they believe that they can actually
do some Jurassic Park Shit.

3024
02:48:35,870 --> 02:48:38,690
What the hell are we waiting for?
I want to see this chicken

3025
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:44,120
chicken source. Rex. I want to see
it. Jurassic Park was a bad ass. Fuck.

3026
02:48:45,290 --> 02:48:48,060
That movie made me like,
man, I hope they do the food.

3027
02:48:48,170 --> 02:48:52,720
When that fucking kid is in the car and
the water starts here and then the clock.

3028
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:56,860
I used to do a little, what's that?
And you see that fucking thing.

3029
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:02,840
Holy Shit. Val. Joe Rogan, who's
scared of animals don't exist.

3030
02:49:03,340 --> 02:49:08,130
Terrifying animals just in
the future. How about that?

3031
02:49:10,170 --> 02:49:14,010
You wouldn't go to Jurassic Park about
new predators. I just gotta go. Joe Rogan.

3032
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:18,370
Would I go to dressers? Drastic Park.
Would you go? Is there a t rex? Yes.

3033
02:49:18,870 --> 02:49:23,850
No, I'm not going. Come on Bro.
Damn breaks loose. So I see a t rex.

3034
02:49:24,320 --> 02:49:28,800
He racks ma'am. Trx on the Grassy Park
movie. The movie. I saw it. T rex.

3035
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:33,330
I've got a big screen TV man.
So legit high definition,

3036
02:49:33,331 --> 02:49:36,690
10 ADP. We got a lot route this bitch
up because we're running out of tape.

3037
02:49:36,750 --> 02:49:38,940
Oh Man. As we won't be able
to process it on iTunes.

3038
02:49:38,941 --> 02:49:42,660
But this was a long and storied
discussion. It was, you guys are awesome.

3039
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:45,570
Thank you Dr. Parsons for

I don't name her name man.

3044
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:04,680
We need to come up with a name when
named for the Ryan Parsons Team,

3045
02:50:05,230 --> 02:50:07,830
the Ryan Parsons posse.
Isn't there a song? A band?

3046
02:50:07,831 --> 02:50:10,710
The Ryan Parsons project is Allen Park.

3047
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:17,520
That's your cousin's son this weekend I'm
