1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,850
Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,470
but in fact your original question of
why am I thinking about simplifying and

3
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:07,340
all those kinds of stuff.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,960
I am a pretty light positive person.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,950
Very optimistic,

6
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:13,311
very.

7
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:15,350
I kind of live in that world,

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,630
but when I just started reading the book,

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,100
are things really pissing me off?

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,210
Am I stressed?

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,480
Do I have anxiety because I live in this
house because I'm trying to do these

12
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:27,380
things with my career because I'm trying
to always do this because I'm carrying

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,500
children and parents
and all of this stuff.

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,470
I'm trying to make everybody happy.

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,050
I'm just,

16
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:33,590
I don't know,

17
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,830
maybe just realizing that
and thinking about it.

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,480
I'm didn't.

19
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,080
No heavy meditation on it.

20
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:39,410
No.

21
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,350
Just being aware that maybe
that's where it's coming from.

22
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,590
I'm telling you over a month and a half
the pain slowly went away and I don't

23
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,334
have it.

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,030
Hm.

25
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,810
Yeah.

26
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,740
That is interesting.

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,520
So what,

28
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,370
like what was bothering you before?

29
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,600
Like I know that you're,

30
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,081
you know,

31
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:02,040
you're successful and you had a television
show for awhile and you've got a

32
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,330
bunch of projects going on.

33
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,670
You're always doing standup and specials,

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,230
so you have had a lot of success.

35
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:09,030
You've got a lot of great stuff going on.

36
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,020
What was,

37
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,820
what was kind of chew and at you?

38
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,180
I don't know.

39
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,390
I'm not really 100 percent
sure of what the sources,

40
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,750
but I do feel like I have a lot
of people on my back and it's all,

41
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,490
it's all quiet.

42
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,570
It's all in my head,

43
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,590
you know what I mean?

44
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,700
A lot of people on your back.

45
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,240
Yeah.

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,500
I've got a wife.

47
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,310
I've got,

48
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,330
I've got kids,

49
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,680
I've got pets,

50
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,240
I've got family.

51
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,240
I've got

52
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,310
in the end that you feel
that there's a weird,

53
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,400
a weird way to um,

54
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,380
bring,

55
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,981
bring this up.

56
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:42,060
But there's that.

57
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,480
How much of that like having
a wife and having kids,

58
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,250
obviously there's going to be compromises
and there's going to be stressed that

59
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,780
comes along with any sort of relationship.

60
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,180
But do you feel like it was tipping more
towards the negative than towards the

61
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:58,014
positive?

62
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,733
Um,

63
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,870
I don't think it was.

64
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,520
I think I just,

65
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,354
uh,

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,660
the whole experience to me seems positive.

67
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,330
My relationship with my wife is great.

68
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,630
The kids I adore,

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,950
I feel like it's all positive,

70
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,960
but I do carry the burden of everybody's
worries and everybody's wellbeing all

71
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,171
the time.

72
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,170
I was working on this act,

73
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,540
this joke in my act before I started
thinking about all this stuff I had this

74
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,890
moment where I'm standing in this house,

75
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,270
I moved to this bigger house.

76
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,850
It's a really nice house to bigger,

77
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,570
bigger home and I was shutting off all
the lights is what I was working through

78
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:37,410
onstage and I was turning off all the
lights one night and locking the doors for

79
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,270
all the bad people that
are coming to get us.

80
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,630
And everyone's in their beds and the
cat's asleep and the dog's asleep and

81
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:44,070
everybody the Lizard Asleep.

82
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,623
And it just,

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,120
all my responsibility washed over me.

84
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,520
Like everybody,

85
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,310
every living thing here is,

86
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,830
is,

87
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:54,990
uh,

88
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,700
depending on my success.

89
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,740
If I don't keep going,

90
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:01,540
if I don't keep succeeding this,

91
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,940
everything here changes
everybody's little life.

92
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,774
Everybody's perfect,

93
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,280
perfect little existence.

94
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,450
It's all washing over me and
I can't tell anyone about it.

95
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,770
I can tell you the audience,

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,620
but I can't go sit on my daughter's bed
at two in the morning when I have that

97
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,454
feeling.

98
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,403
Honey,

99
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,353
do you ever.

100
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,540
Do you ever feel like he
just can't do it anymore?

101
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,610
You ever feel like you can't.

102
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,260
He just want to stop.

103
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,000
He just wanted to take a break.

104
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,150
This whole thing about waking
up my daughter with my fears.

105
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,140
I can't do that.

106
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,820
I don't tell my wife that stuff.

107
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:31,890
I don't tell my kids that stuff.

108
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,860
I just carry it.

109
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,100
So when I started reading
this book I'm like,

110
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:40,000
maybe I'm just taking this really
seriously and feeling like,

111
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,993
hm.

112
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,321
Yeah,

113
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,790
I used to have to deal with a lot more.

114
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,990
I used to choose to deal with it a lot
more and now it's just like I'm 46.

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,480
I don't know.

116
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,190
I'll tell you like there was a person
who came to one of the screenings on the

117
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:51,401
road.

118
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,690
We had the screening at.

119
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,440
Um,

120
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,681
fuck,

121
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:54,490
I forgot where we were.

122
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,230
I want to say New Orleans and of Yoga
hosers I was doing q and a afterwards and

123
00:03:59,231 --> 00:03:59,411
you know,

124
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,370
everyone's getting up and like,

125
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:00,510
oh,

126
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,600
that's fucking stupid.

127
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:06,180
And asking questions and then one guy
gets up and he is like tight dude.

128
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,290
He's very serious and he's just like,

129
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,920
uh,

130
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,311
okay.

131
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,660
You told the big long story
before that movie began and I did.

132
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:13,950
It was a big intro for the movement.

133
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,510
Began told like an hour long
story of how we got there.

134
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,471
And he goes,

135
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:20,470
that story did not match
the movie I just watched.

136
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,101
And I said,

137
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:21,820
no.

138
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,271
And he goes,

139
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,260
not at all.

140
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,011
And he goes,

141
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,810
why did you make that movie?

142
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,681
He's gone.

143
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,950
I found that unwatchable as and
everyone in the audience has gone.

144
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,521
Oh.

145
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:30,881
And I was like,

146
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,714
no many,

147
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,620
he paid like he overpaid to see this
movie if I'm sitting here talking.

148
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,640
So yeah,

149
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,710
let him say what he want,

150
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,680
like I'm a big boy and fine.

151
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,031
And so he goes,

152
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,650
I just don't think you
ever should have made it.

153
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,484
It's terrible.

154
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,031
And I said,

155
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:43,211
well,

156
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,500
you understand that subjective,

157
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:44,741
right?

158
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:48,310
Like you're surrounded by a bunch of
people that feel like the opposite way.

159
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:48,970
Um,

160
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,331
so,

161
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:49,570
you know,

162
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,910
when people were applauding
and shit and then uh,

163
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:54,370
some guy behind him in line jumps
in front of the mic and goes,

164
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,330
you want me to kick his ass?

165
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,164
And I was like,

166
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,981
fuck no.

167
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:57,640
I was like,

168
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,410
everyone's entitled to their opinion.

169
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,041
I said,

170
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,830
but his opinion is I never
should have done this.

171
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:03,160
And you know,

172
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,090
my answer to that is like,

173
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,990
that's ridiculous.

174
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,240
Like if,

175
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,350
if I wanted to make it,

176
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,670
like that's the only reason we're here,

177
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:10,504
I just want to see it.

178
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,550
Like you can choose not to see it.

179
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,510
And in this instance,

180
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,040
I'm really sorry that like you didn't,

181
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,330
artists didn't coincide,

182
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,180
but every time I go to do one of
these things I'd do it the same way.

183
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,250
Whether it was clerks up
to the most recent one.

184
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,710
I just make the movie I want to see.

185
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,090
And hopefully others like it.

186
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,020
And sometimes they do.

187
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,580
And that's amazing and it
feels great and you're like,

188
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:27,971
Holy Shit,

189
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,804
my fingers on the pulse.

190
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,030
And sometimes you're fucking alone.

191
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:31,811
But at least you're like,

192
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm happy with the thing that I made.

193
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,941
I said,

194
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:35,650
but I feel heartbroken
that you came out of,

195
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:36,910
you're looking for
something I didn't give you.

196
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,860
So I said,

197
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,681
I'm going to give you your money back.

198
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,660
And I gave him 40 bucks and I was like,

199
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,540
put it on a riser,

200
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,653
a speaker.

201
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,801
And he goes,

202
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,401
I don't want that.

203
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:45,761
And I was like,

204
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:46,181
no man,

205
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:46,810
honestly take,

206
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,441
it's not a trick.

207
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,300
It's not like Jason Who's going to
come out and hit you with a hammer.

208
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:49,931
Just take it like,

209
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:50,471
I feel bad.

210
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,740
I want you to have a good
time and shit like that.

211
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,961
He goes,

212
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:53,111
no,

213
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:53,944
I don't want that.

214
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,461
And I was like,

215
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:54,671
dude,

216
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:55,930
it makes for an excellent story.

217
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,320
Like I told him his movie fucking blue
to his face and I fucking took his money

218
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,280
and walked out and he goes,

219
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:01,550
no.

220
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,030
And he went and sat down and crossed his
arms and just stayed there for another,

221
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,440
like half hour during the q and a.

222
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,260
So for him it was worth the
$40 bucks just to say it.

223
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,370
I'm going to visit a verb,

224
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,570
like just sit here and fucking hate on
this and let you know and then sit down

225
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:15,590
again so you know,

226
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:16,221
you deal with that,

227
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:19,370
but that's the memorable one
because that never happens.

228
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,690
Generally speaking,

229
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,730
like when we toured the movie,

230
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,090
you're touring and you're
in a safe zone dog.

231
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,930
I hated old edible about a month ago.

232
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,160
I found the back of my draw.

233
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,330
That thing fucked me up

234
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,190
was just like an expired it and you would
take an expired viking and you won't

235
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,330
have paid for a week.

236
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,253
Mouth.

237
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't care how many
root canals they give.

238
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,630
You expired my pants,

239
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,420
my wife's,

240
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,700
my wife and watch that
tell you about that now.

241
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,543
A lot of

242
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,310
surgery.

243
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,090
I pop that motherfucking after it was
washing detergent stronger than ever.

244
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,610
Fucking I just found it.

245
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,841
I found it.

246
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:00,120
I wasn't even on the bike and I took
one out with me in case I had tooth pain

247
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:02,870
and those pain and I never
wore those pants again.

248
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,093
I go to Portland,

249
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,510
I go on the pants and that her,

250
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,750
she watched it right
before I went onstage.

251
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,370
I popped up out that motherfucker

252
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,230
who gives a fuck.

253
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,660
I don't need to know what it is anymore.

254
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,980
I've been through everything.

255
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,840
Pulling a do nothing dog.

256
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,183
Oh,

257
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,363
how strong was it?

258
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,361
Oh my God.

259
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:25,050
I took a half on stage and I blacked
out like the first 30 minutes.

260
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,120
I couldn't wait to get
back to the hotel room.

261
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,213
The other

262
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,070
radio the next day.

263
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,250
Oh my God.

264
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,120
Black the fuck.

265
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,950
I didn't know what came out of my mouth.

266
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,410
When you on radio you just start swearing.

267
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:37,970
No,

268
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,091
no,

269
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:38,191
no,

270
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:38,790
no.

271
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,440
I'm headed to Portland Thursday night.

272
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,693
I'm in Portland.

273
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,990
I'm getting dressed.

274
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,630
When I was pulling pants,

275
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,460
these pants are darker
than my usual jeans.

276
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,533
I never wore.

277
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,981
I didn't want.

278
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:50,814
Well,

279
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,000
last time I went was probably when I had
the surgery and that's when I found the

280
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,530
pill in that they were clean.

281
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,560
I went into the detergent,

282
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,730
had won the numbers down,

283
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,230
so could have been anything,

284
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,113
so I just.

285
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,441
I said,

286
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,271
let me not be an answer.

287
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:04,230
I'll eat the whole thing.

288
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,150
People give me crazy shit all the time.

289
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,750
Let me break this and maybe somebody
gave it to me and I watched over it.

290
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,090
I knew it was like a viking
cousin to the village,

291
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:12,924
you know what I'm saying?

292
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,300
They had to be a cousin
or a brother in law,

293
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,590
something that bike.

294
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:17,971
I popped it.

295
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:19,530
I took a half and went to Portland.

296
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,740
I walked up those stairs and when
I sat down on top of the thing,

297
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:23,040
I was like,

298
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm fucked up.

299
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,731
I smoked dogs,

300
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,131
but I tell you,

301
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,430
I set the fire alarm off and
the club on Friday night,

302
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,300
the fight in the dressing room and the
fucking fire department had to come

303
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:34,680
because the whole club blacks out,

304
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,510
all the lights go out and pilot

305
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,590
had to go onstage and
fucking Felicia what up?

306
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,140
Where?

307
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,630
It's just like,

308
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,940
do you want me to go up
there and check it out?

309
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:44,170
I go,

310
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:44,820
yeah,

311
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,980
that's how much of a comedy store she is.

312
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,010
Like somebody else has said,

313
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,170
well.
