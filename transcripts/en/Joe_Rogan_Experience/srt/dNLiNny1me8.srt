1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,560
I know my memory is unreliable.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,940
That's what the point I'm at.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,150
That's hilarious.

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,820
I can mind everybody's memories.

6
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:10,960
Unreliable people,

7
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,310
they morph their memories to make them
more convenient for their knowledge of

8
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:16,130
the past,

9
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:21,130
whether it's as them as a victim or as
them as the winner or as them as the,

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:21,820
you know,

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,170
oh I didn't get my fair shake.

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:23,861
You know,

13
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:26,050
there was some behind
the scenes shenanigans.

14
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,120
Meanwhile it's,

15
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,080
you are a fucking idiot.

16
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,183
Reliable,

17
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,870
but they're going to use this machine.

18
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,081
Yeah,

19
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:32,914
exactly.

20
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,030
They're not ready yet.

21
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,080
But one day they will,

22
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:37,270
one day we'll be able to
access each other's brains.

23
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,101
Just like you,

24
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:39,070
we send each other photos.

25
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,320
Like if you were somewhere cool and you
sent me a photo and get it on my phone,

26
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,940
we're getting you going
to be able to see my,

27
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,390
my,

28
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,180
I'm going to be able to,

29
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,590
you know,

30
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,790
put public.

31
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:46,931
So,

32
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:47,171
ah,

33
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:48,020
I want make my uh,

34
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,140
my eyesight public cause
I'm at Yellowstone,

35
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:50,771
you know,

36
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:54,970
and you'd go public with your vision and
you show everybody else and he can put

37
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,890
it up on a database
where people draw from.

38
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,000
That'd be like the first step.

39
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,680
People will share their experiences.

40
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,540
A few people sneak in porn or them
jerking off before I park people.

41
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,920
People get to share experiences
and then it'll just go to a,

42
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:09,910
Hey I'm Carl,

43
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,030
I'm always on the,

44
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,240
this is the baddest
motherfuckers always on 24,

45
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,710
seven you can watch them shit.

46
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,880
You can watch him jerk off,

47
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,010
you can watch them at Sachs
and people just start,

48
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,270
they only live their life.

49
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,480
Can't wait to get home with be Carl
is it can't wait to cross out there.

50
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,350
Just doing ecstasy and bag and pitches.

51
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,480
Driving the fast lane,

52
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,983
the animal.

53
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,290
If Carl's channel became public,

54
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,030
everybody would want to just be inside.

55
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,923
Cross.

56
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,240
Yeah.

57
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,340
You can be the hottest selling.

58
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,200
And people would start complaining.

59
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:35,561
They would say,

60
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,310
look man,

61
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,290
nobody is living in a real life anymore.

62
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,120
Everybody's living other people's lives.

63
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,200
Came up with a great concept movie.

64
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:42,870
You doing it right?

65
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,060
Yeah,

66
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,890
because your life is boring as fuck,

67
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,180
but you could just be a Carl.

68
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,380
Carl is out there,

69
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:48,940
Baldwin and it.

70
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,130
Paul gets Carl gets shot.

71
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:51,760
Boom.

72
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,440
You're used to go back to regular life.

73
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,960
That's the risk because then you'd have
to find a new channel to subscribe to.

74
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,450
You know Carl's dead.

75
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,640
You're just going to
follow Eddie for TV shows.

76
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,120
Yeah,

77
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,751
exactly.

78
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,370
I follow Eddie calls best friend.

79
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,780
That will be a new art form.

80
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,250
The new art form would be living your
life in a spectacular manner to which some

81
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:13,600
people would want to actually give up
being a real person so they could be you

82
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:18,400
and experience it directly and
you will become a million people.

83
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,750
They see through you.

84
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,480
We not exactly sure whether
or not they influence Carl.

85
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,300
We think that Carl is
acting independently,

86
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,490
but it is possible if you think about it,

87
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:31,900
that all those minds linked up together
could form one unique and universal

88
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,760
direction in which crawl might want to go.

89
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,310
Well,

90
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,490
that's kind of like Instagram right now.

91
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,631
That's bananas,

92
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:38,740
but you're talking about,

93
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,920
I'm taking it to the next level sign

94
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,680
because if call realizes he gets
a lot of views what he's doing,

95
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,690
then he's going to do more threesomes
course and if he gets a lot of views when

96
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:52,960
he realizes that he's on
a plane or in a Jacuzzi,

97
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,260
he's going to do that.

98
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,241
Look,

99
00:02:56,241 --> 00:03:00,160
when a guy gets recognized for being
a big fat guy and like gets famous for

100
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:00,994
being a fat guy,

101
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,710
if you ever seen one of those guys,

102
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,170
talked to their agents and
the agents will tell you,

103
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,550
I've seen in half with my own eyes,

104
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,631
don't lose weight,

105
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,170
man.

106
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,921
If you lose weight,

107
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:09,850
you're gonna lose roles.

108
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,510
Right?

109
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,260
Why is that?

110
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,060
Because,

111
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,460
because they've locked onto
the idea of you as the fat guy,

112
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,323
right?

113
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,710
They just decide.

114
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,170
They decide.

115
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,440
We still,

116
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,990
let's just gonna.

117
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,890
We'll just keep this going.

118
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,903
Don't fuck this up.

119
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,760
You willing to literally retrain.

120
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,590
People know they just keep eating
so they'll stay fat and funny.

121
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,450
If you told the fat guy like,

122
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,020
hey dude,

123
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,220
people love eating and if you just,

124
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,070
I just need you to just go fucking crazy.

125
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:33,910
If you just eat a lot,

126
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:34,121
bro,

127
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:34,750
all day,

128
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,940
people are going to just be
you as a lot of fat people.

129
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,800
There's skinny in real life,

130
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,011
right?

131
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,950
But they could live like a frat guy
through you and we can make money.

132
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,870
I'm Skechers is it on this?

133
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,240
He wants to sponsor.

134
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,560
So you're eating show.

135
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,470
Let me get some guy who
just all day he does.

136
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,320
He drinks fucking vodka and he eats subs.

137
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,960
Just ball subs.

138
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,680
Chicken parm all day so people subscribe
just so they can experience what it's

139
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:03,670
like to be fucked up drunk with a
chicken like a chicken Parmesan.

140
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,680
Sabalos grapeseed meatballs and sausage
and pepper shit and not allowed to eat

141
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,514
anymore.

142
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,030
Live follicles.

143
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,913
Drunk life.

144
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,760
Follow that.

145
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,170
And every now and then Carl,

146
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,020
go to a massage parlor and
get jerked off and like,

147
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:17,800
yeah,

148
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,041
it'd be,

149
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,320
can't tell your wife about that.

150
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,950
Like Carl's doing some crazy shit.

151
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,960
What's he doing here?

152
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,870
Like three sandwiches.

153
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,470
Yeah,

154
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,601
you,

155
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:24,520
you beat car all.

156
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,680
You don't even tell everybody
about Carl getting jerked off.

157
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,200
He's eating a sub while
he's getting charged off.

158
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,490
The kid's a maniac.

159
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,841
That's,

160
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,674
I like this.

161
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,090
That's the next level shit,

162
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:34,241
man.

163
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,110
That's what's going to happen.

164
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,180
People are saying the kids
are wasting their lives.

165
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:37,451
Right?

166
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,760
You're just wasting live
sitting there watching TV.

167
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,200
You're not even been out
there doing anything.

168
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,950
Well,

169
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,180
that's just TV.

170
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:43,990
TV.

171
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,900
TV is like the smoke
signals of entertainment.

172
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,411
I mean,

173
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,640
it's beautiful for us,

174
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,180
but so was a smoke signal when you
didn't know where the fuck the camp was.

175
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,170
Where is everybody?

176
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,440
Right?

177
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,190
They used to all those.

178
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,680
You're a fucker.

179
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,271
I can find them.

180
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,590
That is a lifesaver,

181
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,790
especially when it's cold out.

182
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,080
That shit was a lifesaver.

183
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,500
Right?

184
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,740
That's the TV is,

185
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:03,400
is the smoke signals of
digital entertainment.

186
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,860
One day you're going to actually be that.

187
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,750
You're going to be in that guy's head.

188
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,830
Are you starting already slowly with
reality shows and all that stuff?

189
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,440
We're all going to be one.

190
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,850
Everybody got Facebook,

191
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:15,930
everybody got to Instagram.

192
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:17,280
Everybody's on something.

193
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,330
Shit's weird.

194
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:18,780
You can,

195
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,570
you can you,

196
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:19,800
you know,

197
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,560
you just can't stream it the way you're
talking about what you know that's

198
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:22,880
coming.

199
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,810
That's going to happen.

200
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,850
It's going to be weird as fuck.

201
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,130
Yeah.
