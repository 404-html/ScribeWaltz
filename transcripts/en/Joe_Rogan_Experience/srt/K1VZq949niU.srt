1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,650
Gentlemen,
very sorry for the late start here,

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:09,651
but uh,
unfortunately I'm the only one that's 

3
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:09,651
here.
Uh,

4
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:12,510
Brian and Eddie and Ari have not shown 
up yet.

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,580
Brian's not showing up because he,
uh,

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,440
he was eating some yogurt and he bit 
down on his spoon and broke his fucking,

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,940
which is,
uh,

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,810
one of the dumbest things I've ever 
heard in my life.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,080
So he's not going to be here and I'm not
stuck in traffic because it's raining in

10
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:35,091
La and when it rains in la,
everybody freaks out and are stuck in 

11
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:37,170
traffic as well.
So that's the story.

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,690
Let me shut this off.
I've got this.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,320
The Guru from gang starr died yesterday.
Very,

14
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:50,250
very sad.
One of my favorite rap bands ever.

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,030
Um,
and tutors,

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,970
only 43 years old.
It makes you stay.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,940
That's only a year older than me.
That's crazy.

18
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:57,810
Shit.
You know,

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,620
dying of cancer and shit used to be 
healthy.

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,590
Now he's dead and that's life 
unfortunately.

21
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:12,591
But the good thing is we still got this 
music life carries on and uh,

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,390
maybe,
maybe somewhere cooler right now,

23
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,250
right?
Who the fuck knows,

24
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,900
right ladies.
Gentlemen?

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,050
So,
uh,

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,090
since I'm starting Solo,
let's get started with a bunch of shit 

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,130
that's going on.
First of all,

28
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,740
this fucking strikeforce thing.
You know,

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,760
one of the reasons why the strikeforce 
thing is so fucked up is because they 

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,411
haven't really done it that many times.
They haven't done these big CBS shows 

31
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:43,161
that many times and they made a bunch of
big mistakes and the big brawl that 

32
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,910
happened afterwards.
I mean,

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,030
first of all,
everyone was criticizing mayhem and 

34
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,140
everyone was saying that may have fucked
up and made him like cost CBS.

35
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:55,140
They're deal.
Alright first of all may have,

36
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:58,410
shouldn't have even been allowed to get 
into that octagon if that was the UFC.

37
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,950
They have security at the stairs.
They have security at the top.

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,350
There's,
you can't just walk into the octagon.

39
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:07,050
Well the fights are going on.
It's literally not possible.

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,640
You can't have that many teammates in 
the,

41
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,970
in the octagon as well when,
you know,

42
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:13,590
when Jake shields,
after his fight,

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,850
he had like seven,
six or seven of his buddies in the cage.

44
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,080
Trainers,
everybody.

45
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:22,620
You can't have that many people.
The UFC does not allow the UFC,

46
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,910
I believe you're allowed to have three 
and they regulate it all and that's what

47
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:31,320
you supposed to do as far as mayhem 
doing something that was inappropriate.

48
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,350
Well,
he definitely did something 

49
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,350
disrespectful.
You know,

50
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,510
Jake shields is in the middle of the 
biggest victory of his life.

51
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Just beads.
Damn fucking Henderson and dominates 

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:41,660
them for four rounds after we got fucked
up for the first round.

53
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,461
So you know,
it's a huge emotional victory for him 

54
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:46,461
and for his teammates.

55
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,820
His teammates rather,
you know,

56
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,330
this is a gigantic fight and he pulled 
it off.

57
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,890
So,
you know,

58
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,280
emotions were running very high and 
mayhem stepped in and,

59
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:58,890
and Bogart at the attention.
And that's not.

60
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,270
But it was a mistake,
you know,

61
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:06,271
he went in there to try to hype up the 
fight the same way they would do in the 

62
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:06,271
UFC the same way.
You know,

63
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:09,250
the famous George St Pierre.
I'm not impressed with your performance.

64
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,420
You know,
when he went in there when Matt Hughes 

65
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:14,420
had just one,
you know,

66
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,810
that kind of shit happens to build up 
fights.

67
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,900
That's what it's for.
But this wasn't planned,

68
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,130
you know,
strikeforce didn't know what was going 

69
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,130
to happen,
may have thought about it last minute.

70
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,450
He just wanted a,
you know,

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,500
who was hyped up because he had one 
earlier than [inaudible] 91 or to 

72
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,560
rematch with jake shields.
So he runs into the octagon and uh,

73
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,870
you know,
they start pushing them out of the way 

74
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:36,870
and then chaos erupts.

75
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,680
He should've never been allowed to get 
into the octagon.

76
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,080
And if he was allowed to get into the 
cage,

77
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,230
they should have had it regulated.
It should have been a situation where 

78
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,230
when,
you know,

79
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,880
they would let jake shields speak.
They ask them all the questions are 

80
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,550
gonna.
Ask him totally respectfully.

81
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,310
He gets his chance.
He gets his moment to say what he has to

82
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:55,630
say,
thank his teammates.

83
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,770
Then after all that's done,
then mayhem comes in.

84
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,110
If that's what they want.
If that's a fight,

85
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:07,111
they're hyping up next.
Who the fuck knows what their plans 

86
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:07,111
were?
They,

87
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:10,351
their,
their plans might not be a mayhem fight 

88
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:10,351
next.
So it should have been up to them a,

89
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,400
they should have,
they should have regulated the cage.

90
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,460
They should have made sure he didn't get
in there as far as like what the Diaz 

91
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,820
brothers did and you know,
and Gilbert Melendez,

92
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,190
those guys have backing up there buddy.

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,900
All right.
Those guys are like brothers.

94
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:27,901
You know those guys.
They're all a bunch of fucking psychos 

95
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,421
and savages.
They're their buddy just wins the 

96
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:33,301
strikeforce middleweight title.
Some pushing goes on there down to get 

97
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:34,300
in there.
That's just the way they are,

98
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,940
you know.
I mean the Diaz brothers,

99
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,650
you know,
people always criticize them,

100
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:43,651
but I think first of all I've been 
getting they shit way more interesting 

101
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:47,940
when you've got someone like nate and 
Nick Diaz that they don't give a fuck.

102
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:52,941
Like they really don't give a fuck.
Like they're not just pretending to not 

103
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:53,740
give a fuck.
They'll do really don't give a fuck.

104
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,940
They will fight in a brawl on CBS on 
prime time.

105
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:02,941
They don't give a fuck.
They really knew what was going on and 

106
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:02,941
they still stepped in there.
Did that.

107
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,640
You can't just have them all together 
like that and let anybody in that you 

108
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,190
want.

109
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,730
It's like I used to have pit bulls and 
when you get a bunch of pit bulls in the

110
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:17,731
room,
you can't get mad at the pit bulls if 

111
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:18,340
they fight each other.
That's just what they do and these kinds

112
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:22,060
of professional mixed martial arts 
fighters and in mixed martial arts,

113
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,930
definitely there's a psychological 
aspect to it that's a huge component of 

114
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,340
of fighting and whether or not you win 
or lose and these guys have this 

115
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,830
psychological edge over their opponents 
because they're so aggressive because 

116
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,400
they're so down to fight at any moment's
notice.

117
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,230
They don't give a fuck.
They're not afraid.

118
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,780
They're ready to throw down,
and because of that,

119
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:48,781
that's a significant advantage.
It's a significant tactic when it comes 

120
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:53,431
to fighting and they're not going to 
relinquish that just because they're on 

121
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:57,091
national television.
So if someone gets some other boys' 

122
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:57,620
faces and disrespects them,
they're kind of fight.

123
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,000
I mean,
that's just what's going to happen.

124
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,380
So what I blame is I think mayhem 
certainly made an error,

125
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,590
but you should've never been allowed to 
get into the position to make that 

126
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:08,590
error.
It was completely,

127
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,731
in my opinion,
on strikeforce or the committee or 

128
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:13,610
whoever the fuck is supposed to be 
watching that cage,

129
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,590
you know,
I don't know who's responsible for that.

130
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,500
The UFC takes care of all that shit.
I never have to think about it.

131
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,030
But whoever was responsible for that,
it was a god disaster.

132
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,720
So that's,
uh,

133
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,750
that's my,
my opinion on that.

134
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,420
And as far as like the commentary goes 
and if people were talking about how bad

135
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:33,170
the commentary is,
this is what I'm think about that I like

136
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:38,171
frank shamrock.
I liked Francek frank shamrock as a 

137
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:38,171
person.
I enjoy them.

138
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:38,210
I think he's funny.
Um,

139
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,060
I don't mind this commentary at all 
those other two dudes.

140
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,910
So like my mom said,
if you don't have anything nice to say,

141
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,940
don't say anything at all.
So I'm not gonna say Shit because I 

142
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,110
think those guys need work,
you know,

143
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,380
it's not as easy as it looks and you got
to be a fan of the sport.

144
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,810
And um,
I'm not sure that the main guys a fan of

145
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,090
the sport,
I don't even want to mention his fucking

146
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:00,200
name.
So,

147
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,610
um,
here we are,

148
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:02,680
this is the,
the,

149
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:07,681
the four slash 20 episodes of the 
podcast and what we'll do is I'll just 

150
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:10,560
ramble until everybody gets here already
in it.

151
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,450
He should be here within probably 15 to 
20 minutes depending on what the traffic

152
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:18,440
looks like and when they get here,
then we'll jump off.

153
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,560
So between now and then I'll just take 
questions.

154
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,800
If you see my office here,
if you notice it's things have changed.

155
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,490
I got rid of some shit here,
move something out and I'm going to put 

156
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:30,800
a green screen behind me.
So,

157
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,740
uh,
for the next ustream stream podcasts,

158
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,880
uh,
hopefully the next one if not the next 

159
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:38,900
one,
the one after that I'll be in space.

160
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,550
So the way we're going to have it set up
is we're going to have a podcast,

161
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,740
then I'm going to,
how I'm going to have a green screen,

162
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:50,741
I'm going to have a,
a total space background and then I'll 

163
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:55,241
have couches and shit like that.
So the idea is that it'll look like 

164
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,241
couches flying through space.
And so that should be pretty 

165
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:58,400
interesting.
This whole thing is,

166
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,420
you know,
I started out this podcast sort of just 

167
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,520
kind of as a roof and uh,
you know,

168
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,990
I just thought it'd be an interesting 
thing to do.

169
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:06,380
I'd always wanted to do something like 
that.

170
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,500
I always enjoyed radio,
but uh,

171
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,420
I kind of never got off my ass to do it.
And now I've done it.

172
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,590
I think this is like the twelfth or the 
13th week in a row.

173
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,700
So,
uh,

174
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,430
we've been real consistent and uh,
it's been a lot of fun.

175
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,940
And now it's number eight on the comedy 
section of Itunes,

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,120
which is crazy because the audio part of
it was just sort of an afterthought to 

177
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,181
throw that up.
And ustream one is getting plenty of 

178
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:31,181
it's and it's,
um,

179
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:35,570
it's good fun.
It's a fun way to supplement,

180
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,590
you know,
comedy.

181
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,160
And I'm speaking academy.
I got one Gig,

182
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,350
uh,
this Friday night and Sacramento,

183
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:47,351
but it's already sold out.
I'm going to be doing the color 

184
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:48,650
commentary for a joe say Aldo versus 
Uriah Faber.

185
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,910
Um,
the,

186
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:50,580
uh,
the,

187
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I don't think they're,
they're literally not even referring to 

188
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:55,600
it as the WEC.

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,210
They're just referring to it as although
versus favor,

190
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,330
I'm not exactly sure why that is.
I think,

191
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,440
you know for now because it's because 
the preliminary is going to be on spike 

192
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,880
TV lot,
a lot,

193
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:10,881
a lot of corporate shit.
So that's what's going on.

194
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,020
I got a bunch of stuff to talk about.
First of all,

195
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,350
this fucking volcano over Iceland is 
nuts.

196
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,590
If you haven't noticed that there's a.
my wife had no idea what was going on 

197
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,790
because she doesn't pay attention to 
shit except for gossip.

198
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,530
But uh,
the uh,

199
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,380
there's a,
a giant volcano in Iceland.

200
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,120
It literally is erupting through the 
ice.

201
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:38,121
It's pretty bad ass.
We look at some of the video footage 

202
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:38,121
online.
If you google it,

203
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:41,640
it's really pretty intense.
You seeing like molten lava squirting up

204
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:46,641
through the ice is really wild and the 
volcanic ash has gotten so bad that they

205
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:51,300
have canceled all the air flight,
uh,

206
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,500
over Europe for days and days.

207
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,700
Oh,
our spheres here.

208
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,090
How'd you get in?
Oh,

209
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,210
beautiful.
Right for this place out.

210
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:02,520
I did.
See,

211
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,410
ladies and gentlemen,
he's here.

212
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,980
Eddie Bravo shouldn't be moments behind.
I'm sure he's very close.

213
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,450
Could even ring the doorbell.
No,

214
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,900
he didn't.
I didn't even hear it.

215
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,370
Not so much a rambling.
We're talking about the,

216
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:17,620
um,
the Iceland volcano and you know that.

217
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:20,350
I'm not sure.
Nobody can fly anywhere today.

218
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:23,440
They just lifted it,
but I wouldn't fucking fly it fully.

219
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,700
Yeah.
They lifted the air,

220
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:29,701
the air band over Europe,
but that's because it's costing them 

221
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:29,701
$200,
million dollars a day.

222
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,850
You know?
How many is that?

223
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,920
The airline industry in this country.
I know.

224
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,130
It's all crazy.
$200.

225
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:40,960
Million dollars a day.
How about that?

226
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:46,890
How fragile is this world and any little
thing can happen and things closed down 

227
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,480
for a couple of days.
And these businesses there,

228
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,730
they run so on the edge that just a 
couple days off work and they to come 

229
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:55,930
close to being bankrupt.

230
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,290
I like people like fucking hurls doors 
with his full carrier can't fly home.

231
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:00,970
And I'm like,
you know what?

232
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,980
We could've had all life.
White people have no idea what volcanoes

233
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:14,140
are all about.
Volcanoes have reshaped this earth.

234
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,160
Like when you're in Hawaii,
you get,

235
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:21,161
if you ever got the line yet,
we've gone over the volcano and a 

236
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:21,161
helicopter.
It's the fucking coolest thing ever.

237
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Uh,
I went to the big island and we took a 

238
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,261
trip on a helicopter and we flew over 
the volcano and you're flying over this 

239
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:32,670
active volcano.
You're watching the lava bubble up 

240
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:32,670
inside.
You can see the fucking line,

241
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,620
you can see it and you could see it roll
into the ocean.

242
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,840
Like we fly over to where it rolls in 
the ocean.

243
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,170
It's moving four inches every year 
closer to Japan,

244
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,900
fucking crazy.
And there's another island,

245
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:50,050
there's another island in the middle of 
the ocean that hasn't quite popped up 

246
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,050
yet,
but it's on its way.

247
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,000
It's going to be the next island and the
Hawaiian islands underneath on its way.

248
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,230
It's building up.
That whole area is just one gigantic 

249
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,640
stuff comes out.
It just draws your eyes and it becomes 

250
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,080
a,
it becomes rock and then it breaks down 

251
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,580
and becomes dirt and plants grow on it.
Yeah,

252
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,580
I mean it literally is that,
that's what Hawaii is.

253
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:13,040
It's a volcano and it just came out of 
the ground and,

254
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,170
and created islands,
but you could see the fucking volcano 

255
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,440
and they have all these different photos
that you could buy there and videos you 

256
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,391
could watch out.
There's a bunch of towns that were 

257
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:29,701
completely wiped out on the big island 
where they'll show you where the town 

258
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:33,100
used to be.
The lava just came rolling in like the 

259
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,250
fifties and just crush the entire town.
I think it happened in the 18 bullets.

260
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,740
I'm going to catch up.
I didn't see any of that,

261
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,180
but I'm sure there must be.
I mean,

262
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:43,240
most of the stuff just gets smushed.
The lot of that comes down.

263
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:48,241
It's just literally annihilates any 
evidence whatsoever that anything was 

264
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:51,601
there as well.
People don't realize is that she just 

265
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:52,680
happened so many times.
You know,

266
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,750
this world has changed so many times,
just in the last few million years.

267
00:12:59,370 --> 00:12:59,950
The,
um,

268
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,500
the best place to find mega donald 
skeletons.

269
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,290
Meglawn teeth.
You know what a mega is there?

270
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,310
The,
these giant,

271
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:11,311
ancient prehistoric sharks.
They're like fucking way bigger than 

272
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:11,311
great wines.
Well,

273
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:15,720
the best place to find their teeth is in
Montana recovers.

274
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,060
It used to be the ocean.
How fucking fucking crazy Montana used 

275
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,980
to be under water,
you know,

276
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:25,810
so many parts of let's just,
uh,

277
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,540
just like 10,000
years ago,

278
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,630
half of North America was under a mile 
high sheet of ice just 10,000

279
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:34,810
years ago.

280
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,090
That's nothing.
That's nothing.

281
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Ten thousand years is nothing.
Ten thousand years ago they were saber 

282
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,310
tooth tigers and woolly mammoths because
you know,

283
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:44,320
that just 10,000
years ago,

284
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,230
fucking Saber Tooth Tigers,
10,000

285
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,870
years isn't shit.
There are people around them.

286
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,440
What was the $10,000
for that?

287
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,280
We don't know.
Ten thousand years before that.

288
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,870
I mean,
it was sort of human civilization.

289
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,700
It's all who the fuck knows.
I mean,

290
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:01,720
we know that the big extinction was 65 
million years ago.

291
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,830
That was the,
you know,

292
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,840
the one that hit the Yucatan,
the big meteor or girl that wiped out 

293
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,241
supposedly wiped out everything.
So small mammals and anything bigger 

294
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:17,011
than like a fucking hamster was go.
Why were they figured out a way to 

295
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:19,740
burrow underground and hardy rats and 
shit like that,

296
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:21,850
you know,
rats or some party animals,

297
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,900
you know,
and we're like the descendants of 

298
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,670
anything that survived 65 million years 
while the rest will,

299
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,080
all sorts of mammals.
I mean,

300
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,470
and some birds,
I mean just dinosaurs are direct to set 

301
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,470
or birds or direct descendant of 
dinosaurs.

302
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,640
Somehow or another,
some birds survive,

303
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,300
but literally most of the life on the 
planet was wiped the fuck out.

304
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,960
And then there's the super volcanoes,
men super volcanoes and been wiping out 

305
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,420
things on this continent for millions 
and millions of years.

306
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Every six to 800,000
years of yellowstone blows up and 

307
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,911
literally wipes out the whole continent,
kills everything whenever we started 

308
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:02,850
speaking.
And there's been 2000 earthquakes in 

309
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,980
yellowstone national park since January 
of this year

310
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,430
of earthquakes.
And how there's so many more now.

311
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,350
Is that true?
No,

312
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,360
no,
exactly the same.

313
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,440
Just happened to big cities.

314
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,530
Really?
Yeah.

315
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,320
So there's the same amount.
It's just a hitting places where people.

316
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,290
Yeah,
and if it happens,

317
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,090
I mean if you had an earthquake in 
Bakersfield,

318
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:22,970
as long as the damage,
if we get it on the corner of sunset and

319
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:24,830
Fairfax,
it's going to be tremendous,

320
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,430
you know,

321
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,730
but it seems like there's so many of 
them.

322
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,640
They seemed like a lot.
Is that because of,

323
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,640
uh,
the news,

324
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,010
like there's more access to information 
now.

325
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,110
Last year was the year of celebrity 
death,

326
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,550
you know,
it wasn't,

327
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,160
know it never had before,
but it just keeps happening.

328
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,400
I shouldn't have done it last year with 
Jackson.

329
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,230
That chick that was hot.
It was a choice.

330
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:52,231
Angeles,
that's your legacy chick.

331
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,060
That was hard.
It was in Charlie's angels.

332
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,620
Oh yeah.
Did he died last year or this year?

333
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,860
Because we did that episode about beer.
Slippery.

334
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,040
They're already talking about it openly 
and we talked about it.

335
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,410
A bunch of celebrities are dying,
but it's not,

336
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:11,270
it's just,
I think it's just tmz makes more people.

337
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,010
Celebrities.

338
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,390
That's true.
You know,

339
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,410
there's,
there's way more celebrities down in 

340
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:18,410
there before.
Do you know gangster rap band.

341
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,750
Gangsta Guru from gang starr just die.

342
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,670
You don't give a fuck.
Did I just barely existed?

343
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,710
Already knew is that you never heard him
sing their songs.

344
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:33,340
You don't sing or rap.
One of the stories.

345
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,370
I'll play you one second.
Video Guru,

346
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,710
but a great person.
There might be one of the best like 

347
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,220
lyrical bands,
the 99 populous and he died last night,

348
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:15,180
apparently had cancer and now you just 
got this accompany cancer.

349
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,840
40th three bucks.
That's like me.

350
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:26,030
I'm almost 43 artists trying to natural 
causes not get hit by a fucking shit.

351
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Just gave us a song.
So he was,

352
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,600
he was not seen in true romance where 
these,

353
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,640
like a year ago Williams not.
Yeah.

354
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,970
So it was Christopher walken and in the 
air,

355
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:56,470
the guy,
uh,

356
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,210
so you people know who the guy from.
What was he going to remember that 

357
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,590
movie?
That was awesome.

358
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Waterworld believed that Jesus Christ,
he's under 100 pounds.

359
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,250
Wow.
Can be hot.

360
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,660
But the weirdest fucking thing in the 
world is these women that think they're 

361
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,850
being super skinny,
like anorexic is hot.

362
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,340
That shit is disgusting.
It's more some people like how could 

363
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,960
have fucking any guide like that.
That's so anti nature nature.

364
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:47,220
You want a woman that has a fatter ass.
You want her to take tests,

365
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,040
she can milk the baby.
You want to have her answer.

366
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,940
She can survive the pregnancy.
Those are all like dessert,

367
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,140
but those things are good,
but that's why those things are there.

368
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,570
That traffic tickets,
the reason why they're attractive,

369
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:06,110
it's like actions

370
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,380
because that's too much.
That's obese.

371
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,260
That's unhealthy,
but a little bit of fat is good.

372
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:15,790
Like a little fat fast.
Just like Tony.

373
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,650
That's not good because they can't move 
around.

374
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,090
Good.
You want athletic,

375
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,370
but you want some fat on them.
That's what it is.

376
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,440
It's all nature.
It's all leftover shit.

377
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,530
I mean,
think about how easy it is to trick your

378
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,420
system.
How about fake tits?

379
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,540
We know they're fake.
We know there's a bag of plastic 

380
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,950
underneath your skin,
but still it makes you.

381
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,680
It looks hotter.
They poke out and they look ridiculous 

382
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,800
like that poor fucking girl.
What is her name?

383
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,690
Heidi Montag.
Do you know what machines is?

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,460
Yeah,
he don't.

385
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,100
He doesn't pay attention.
He's the anti gossip man,

386
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,670
but there's a heidi mom tag chick is a.
she's one of those celebrities for just 

387
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:57,050
being a celebrity,
like you're not exactly sure why she.

388
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,760
She just had 10 plastic surgeries 
altogether.

389
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,530
She had her chin on her tits done.
She had all these shirts that are worth.

390
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Some people say she looks better,
but I didn't think she looked bad to 

391
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,280
begin with.
She just had to kind of a big chin,

392
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,940
like sorta like a Jay Leno thing going 
on.

393
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,800
But she was pretty like,
you know,

394
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,680
like she didn't have to do that.
Like it doesn't make you look better.

395
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,500
It just makes you like different.
Definitely sluttier.

396
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,590
She had big tents to begin with.
She had a big fake tits and she got 

397
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,780
giant one,
so now they're like ridiculous.

398
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:28,340
Like they look stupid.
I like a solid suit.

399
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,210
Sounds good.
It's amazing.

400
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,730
But it's like crazy.
Crazy book.

401
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,670
Yeah.
When you see girls who have.

402
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,710
It's so funny,
like La is so fucked up with fake test 

403
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,770
that you see girls got real tense of the
kind of like sagging.

404
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,820
Show those what's wrong.
While

405
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,600
it's just like,
that's normal,

406
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,690
let's go look at fucking videos of 
Africa.

407
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,570
You know,
you're not supposed to have these,

408
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,840
these missile tests that stick straight 
out of your chest.

409
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,490
That shit's not normal.
I think they look real nice,

410
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:03,770
but I grew up in like a feed with the 
two.

411
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,790
It's still hanging out a little bit.
Just pull it just looked like they did 

412
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,370
when they were pointing.
It's amazing though,

413
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,990
how,
how easy it is to trick us sunglasses.

414
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,090
It was good to me.
More of those people,

415
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,860
you know,
it's like you've got the right surgery,

416
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,780
right?
You look great.

417
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,690
To me more is 47 years old and she still
looks God.

418
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,910
How the fuck is she doing that?
I saw that.

419
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:29,911
That's incredible.
The model with the book there shirt,

420
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,320
but it's not that much in person.
She was at a UFC maybe two years ago,

421
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,460
so she's be 47,
48.

422
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,020
She's hot as fuck dude.
Still,

423
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,120
you know,
I'm sure the vaginas just done.

424
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,060
I'm sure this is drives.
Fuck yeah.

425
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,710
There's no more blood coming out of that
time.

426
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,590
There's no more periods.
15 when you had 15,

427
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,980
that's a wrap.
No more periods.

428
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That means you're not oscillating means 
you're not really able to have babies 

429
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,360
anymore.
Your body starts to fuck off.

430
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,870
You're just shooting loads into a 
cemetery and shooting those into a 

431
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,660
casket.
Got that in there.

432
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,250
It's still it's intelligent trick.
You might as well be fucking a rubber 

433
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,141
doll.
I mean you're having sex with a person 

434
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:15,100
that's all well and good,
but as far as like you shooting a load 

435
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,100
inside of her,
it's a total waste of time,

436
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,680
but we don't want to.
I'm not saying that,

437
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,640
but I'm saying like for nature it's like
a Jew.

438
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,750
I mean the only reason why sex feels 
good is to trick you into fucking so 

439
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,750
that you make

440
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,410
would say with a Jewish mystical theory 
about what he wants to know when you 

441
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,440
pull out or when you masturbate,
your semen is said to have been pregnant

442
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:42,781
at some demon will make.
It's like they're like appearance right 

443
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:46,020
here and she just fucking you as your 
last rating redness.

444
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,510
Then when you get to heaven or 40 of 
them in this purgatory level,

445
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,420
you have to face all your kids and 
they're like,

446
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:57,421
why?
Why couldn't we be born real people and 

447
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:58,000
they're all like formed and mangled and 
you have to answer all of them.

448
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,710
Oh my God.

449
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,620
That might be the greatest story.
How come on?

450
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,880
How Much Kabbalah?
Because they taught me this when you 

451
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,061
were a child and other people that don't
know are you spent a bunch of years and 

452
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:15,920
is used as a seriously religious man?
Like read the Torah.

453
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:16,730
How many hours a day?

454
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,570
When I was in Israel,
I don't know,

455
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:20,680
10,
12,

456
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,910
12 hours a day.
Reading the Torah.

457
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,740
We're going to have to fire up the 
volcano for that.

458
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,640
Son got paid to go ahead and this is 
great,

459
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,740
man.
You really revamped.

460
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,600
Oh Dude.
I'm turning this into a real studio.

461
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,700
Did a solo.
It took like 12 hours.

462
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,520
I did have people help me get rid of the
desk.

463
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,670
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you ever heard of a volcano,

464
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,740
you know what a volcano is.
A volcano is a vaporizing device and 

465
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:54,491
what a vaporizer and you know,
the big argument about thc about 

466
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:56,780
marijuana in general is that you 
shouldn't smoke and the smoke is bad for

467
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:57,680
your lungs.
Well,

468
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,750
you don't have to smoke it,
you can eat it,

469
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,960
but eating is very tricky because he 
didn't get too fucked up because when 

470
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,801
you eat it,
it's processed by the liver and it 

471
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:08,930
creates something called 11 hydroxy 
metabolite,

472
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,050
which is four times more psychoactive 
than thc.

473
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,000
And it's really a totally different 
experience,

474
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,070
you know,
that's why people get freaked out.

475
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,260
That's why,
you know,

476
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,370
I'm sure a lot of you have seen that 
video where that dude,

477
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,570
he's a cop and he calls up,
um,

478
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,150
the uh,
nine slash 11 and says that he thinks 

479
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,761
he's dying because,
because he and his girlfriend aid some 

480
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,630
pot brownies and uh,
he says,

481
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,940
time was moving really slow and he 
thinks he's dying.

482
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,790
Well,
let's see,

483
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,290
gentlemen.

484
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,280
Oh,

485
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,610
to get the office cleaned.
This mother Fucker,

486
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,650
dude,
I got rid of the desk and I'm turning 

487
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:47,650
this thing into a school.
You,

488
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,380
we live right now.
There's over 2000 people.

489
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,270
This is the biggest crowd we've ever had
anywhere else.

490
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,130
That's a vaporizers and vaporizers 
please gentlemen,

491
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,340
it blows into this plastic bag and it 
looks like,

492
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,420
like a,
like a

493
00:24:59,550 --> 00:24:59,780
no

494
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,360
Saran wrap or some shit and you just get
pure thc vapor.

495
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,660
And what it does is it heats up the 
little crystals on the thd and releases 

496
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,860
them and it comes out like missed.
So there's no smoke at all.

497
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:16,910
So there's no argument anymore.
There's no negative health effects.

498
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,970
I'm going to have two dedicated cameras 
in here and this is going to be a green 

499
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,250
screen and we're going to be in space.
What I set this up within two weeks.

500
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,620
This will all be green behind us.
And then what we'll watch,

501
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:38,690
it wouldn't be like we're flying to the 
universe on a couch because every 

502
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:43,670
episode is a different person than they 
were in Africa.

503
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,740
So,
uh,

504
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,160
what we're talking about,
we went over volcanoes.

505
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,500
We went over,
I went over strikeforce.

506
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,420
I don't know if you've got any opinion 
on strikeforce.

507
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,510
I said the whole reason why that brought
took place is because they didn't,

508
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,750
they didn't guard the cage,
they didn't do a good job of making sure

509
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:00,800
that nobody got in there.

510
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,340
That was the finance was like,
I want to go this bottom,

511
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,620
like this spice done.
It's over and over one.

512
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,950
Well,
and what may have went in there and 

513
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:11,950
talked with jake shields was in the cage
and said,

514
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:11,950
Yo,
Jay,

515
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,921
but am I getting the rematch?
Gilbert Melendez push made him out of 

516
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:16,921
the way.
The Diaz brothers jumped,

517
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,640
may,
have,

518
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,010
may have pushed up,
jumped in.

519
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,150
It was a brawl to lose kicking him.
When he was down,

520
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:24,590
it was like four people on.
Um,

521
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,950
Eric Apple took jake shields and got 
them out of there and push them over to 

522
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,260
the other sides and being involved in 
the Bra.

523
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,690
I mean,
it was a fucking a bench clearing brawl.

524
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,190
So it was pretty awesome.
That was a great.

525
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,860
There's a great picture online where 
someone from the audience captured it on

526
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:43,980
their phone or something where jake 
shields and nick are coming.

527
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,490
It's like from behind change or behind 
me.

528
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,930
Yeah,
it's a great.

529
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:55,410
Yeah,
man was standing there and Nick Diaz is 

530
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,430
like this and jake shields is like that.
Gilbert Melendez on the other side,

531
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:02,150
those fucking dudes,
they have a lot of unity and I respect 

532
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:02,280
that and you know,
and everybody's like,

533
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,820
oh,
there is

534
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,230
isn't there,
this and that.

535
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,370
Well,
you got to realize,

536
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:10,371
man,
these dudes are fucking professional 

537
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:10,371
cage fighters.
Right?

538
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:14,060
During their scrapping with each other 
every day they're down to die for each 

539
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,870
other.
The reputation is hugely important.

540
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:20,871
They're not going to fucking back down.
They're not going to have a situation 

541
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:23,600
where they look like a bitch.
They're not going to allow someone to 

542
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,121
think of them.
Anybody who think that their buddy got 

543
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:26,730
disrespected but they didn't do anything
about it.

544
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:28,320
That's not gonna happen.
So any,

545
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:30,890
any sort of a situation like that where 
we're all takes place.

546
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:35,070
I played fucking strikeforce.
I blame strikeforce for allowing that to

547
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:40,071
get to that deposition.
Allowing those fucking do to get into 

548
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:40,660
the cage.
Was abroad the comments or last week?

549
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,750
Yeah,
there were some.

550
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,350
That's people that everyone's scared of.
They him to leave and it lit up as far 

551
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,510
as the front patio and allegory.
I was scared.

552
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:55,511
They were like,
just call the cops and get them out of 

553
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:55,511
here,
but they wouldn't do it.

554
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,861
Eventually fight broke out and some of 
the let's go put front and I saw the 

555
00:27:58,861 --> 00:27:59,830
fight and I'm like,
I don't want to get involved with this.

556
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:02,710
I don't get stabbed for someone else 
already.

557
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,000
Let's go fight.
Well,

558
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:09,001
it's like everybody,
like everybody in as the enforcer now,

559
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,170
seriously come on for the reasons that 
some guys were like,

560
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,370
oh,
so how long have you been doing?

561
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,160
Did you choke me out?
You might be the baddest motherfucker.

562
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,150
Did you hear what Gus Johnson sale under
Johnson said,

563
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,460
somebody I.
This hasn't been confirmed,

564
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,320
but I'm just going to say it because I 
hope it's true.

565
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,130
Gus Johnson,
who's the guy who's the black dude,

566
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:40,131
he does the commentary.
Strikeforce made a bunch of errors 

567
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:40,230
called like arm bars.
I was like,

568
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,520
this.
See this,

569
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:43,500
ladies and gentlemen,
see the fogging that that's missed.

570
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,040
Well,
anyway,

571
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,960
this reporter called them up and ask him
about it.

572
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:47,650
I think it was Mike Russell,
his name,

573
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,550
and he said,
listen dog,

574
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:52,920
I know the Gypsy bar.
Kamala Khan more.

575
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,510
I trained.
He said,

576
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:55,800
if you want to come down and roll with 
me,

577
00:28:55,801 --> 00:29:00,801
I'll show you the difference.
Like he's challenging guys to roll with 

578
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:04,851
it.
Like he trades like Gus Johnson on the 

579
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:04,880
Internet.
Yes.

580
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,660
Mike Russell on the Internet yet?
No,

581
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,170
it's too far.
We can pull the scores but it.

582
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,290
But we put close to.
The problem is there's three of us here 

583
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,650
can read it.
They can't read it.

584
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,900
We don't have to read it.
You could just talk.

585
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,370
We got to pay attention to the audience.
Yeah,

586
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,450
but you can't pay attention to the 
audience and keep a conversation going 

587
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:29,450
at the same time.

588
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,740
Yeah.
That's not really questioning.

589
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,280
Lumped it all.

590
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,330
Yeah.
Have be great if like if the dea busted.

591
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,610
We're all legal.
We have prescription.

592
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:48,650
Yeah.
Were legal and I wouldn't mind some are 

593
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,270
crackers back up and I'll fill the bag 
up again more seriously though.

594
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:00,550
Seriously,
because there's the 4:20

595
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,670
episodes we should be allowed to have 
like order pizza during the show.

596
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,010
It's for 20.
We're getting high,

597
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,670
like snacking on shit that fucks up with
the flux of the conversation.

598
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,410
Never had a great conversation and 
eating pizza.

599
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:22,411
But yeah,
but people are watching this 

600
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:22,411
conversation.
This conversation is like a show,

601
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:25,280
but I'm talking about how it all 
started.

602
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:30,430
I said,
why don't you just go walk into my 

603
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:36,241
kitchen and just go scrounge around the 
way we've got a show to do something 

604
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,980
where people order pizza pizza later and
the idea will be the pizza comes right 

605
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,190
before we killed this now.

606
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,670
Okay,
how dare you motherfuckers.

607
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,220
So I'm artist telling us something 
hilarious.

608
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,080
Listen to this shit.
Stop.

609
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,350
Need to,
need to be focusing on show sun.

610
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,310
Ra was telling us that there's a,
an ancient Jewish,

611
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:02,650
whatever the fuck it is,
Jewish mystical thought.

612
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,250
There's a waste.
The waste statement.

613
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,660
So,
um,

614
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,360
they say when you pull out and not 
really math,

615
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,790
reading your fucking woman was nothing.
Just like a ghost.

616
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,680
And when you go,
when you go through a place,

617
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,170
all your kids would have been born in 
the real life.

618
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,660
Even a woman.
And like,

619
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,770
like why did you pull out?
We want him to be born real boys.

620
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,330
Didn't have any kids.
You've got a building.

621
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,730
You've got a billion monster babies.
I think it's per load.

622
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,320
You're like fucking one Venus?
I think so.

623
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:57,190
So how many games do you think you got?
Dammit,

624
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm going to have a much more efficient 
set up here as well with this gentleman 

625
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,890
when we get back on an average day for 
weeks.

626
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,190
My belief,
since you shouldn't six loads a week,

627
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,520
sometimes more than one of those.
Do you ever feel like a loser when you 

628
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,140
get to live?
If I jerk off more than once a day that 

629
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:30,870
I'm just obsessed.
Bad.

630
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,590
That's bad.
Obviously.

631
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:34,600
I'm not morning already.
Jerked off.

632
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,660
I know,
but why?

633
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,560
Why?
Just sit there like a monkey?

634
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,050
Yeah.
While you're fucking.

635
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,920
You know,
you'd be bad at reading,

636
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,220
spreading the seed that's ready to seed.
You're jerking off into a Napkin.

637
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,170
Vagina.
Then if there was a good job to do,

638
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,360
no one has ever said no.
I'd rather just check off.

639
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:01,810
I'm sorry.

640
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,370
Telling you that masturbation is so bad 
that you're fucking.

641
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,760
That's like the worst case scenario.
You're having sex with the demon and 

642
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,761
make it half demon babies that are going
to be waiting for you when you die to 

643
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:17,391
scream and yell at you.
That is because the institution of 

644
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:17,620
marriage,
they want that.

645
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,670
That helps religion people making units 
and it's amazing though.

646
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,080
Like what?
Why do they give a fuck?

647
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,760
I don't know.
Why don't you give a fuck if you 

648
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:31,760
masturbate?
What is,

649
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,550
what is it about masturbation?
About no masturbation,

650
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,780
you know that somehow or another equates
to them having more control over you 

651
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,070
with the more you don't have to pay,
the more you want.

652
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,630
Fuck,
fuck.

653
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:42,610
Women face.
So the results of Vegas,

654
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,630
the morning mass with Less Vegas.
So that's got to be example why the 

655
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,300
Catholic Church doesn't want you to any 
birth control too,

656
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:48,570
right?

657
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,920
Yes.
That makes sense.

658
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:54,921
Yeah.
Well it's definitely way for someone 

659
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:54,921
when they have kids.
I feel that myself.

660
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:57,060
I feel like I'm easier to control now 
that you have kids,

661
00:33:57,061 --> 00:34:02,061
when you,
when you have kids and you want 

662
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:02,061
everything to be nice,
you know you want everything to be easy.

663
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:03,450
I don't want any drama,
you know,

664
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,640
turn them like this,
but man it a demon babies,

665
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:11,750
you're,
you're,

666
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,750
you're fucking demon thing.
They came up with the worst story ever.

667
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:21,530
You fucking a demon and you make babies 
that are half demon and they're waiting 

668
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,650
for you when you die.
What the fuck man,

669
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,640
Mr stuff.

670
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,990
It's like,
why stop?

671
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,990
Because you know,
by the time we figured that out,

672
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:32,991
you've already checked off like a 
thousand times 50,000

673
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,160
demons.
I'm fucked either way.

674
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Might as well enjoy this.
Be something you could do to cancel out 

675
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:46,491
the other demons to make up for it.
There's got to be like,

676
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,760
what if you let it lie at 12 babies you 
know with,

677
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:54,830
with your wife,
but masquerade three times you get to 

678
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:54,830
heaven.
You have three little dema babies.

679
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,130
You're still gonna like tasks

680
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,100
do on earth that cancel out your demon 
babies because they're.

681
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,750
There's got to,
there's got to me.

682
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,690
Because what about people that are 
trying to convert to this religion?

683
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,380
I would,
I that the Jews don't give a fuck.

684
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:14,381
I already got $75,000
recruiting religion ever.

685
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:17,090
They don't give a fuck.
We tried to convince me not to do it.

686
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,340
Yeah.
They make it really hard.

687
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,400
Also is a Jewish thing.
It's like a regular Jewish.

688
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:26,330
You were saying all of them.
You don't want to lie.

689
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,210
I never heard of this before.
I never heard of it either you,

690
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,390
your old tests,
but they're like chapter.

691
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,700
It is the Torah.

692
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,910
Fairly decent study that took like 10 
hours a,

693
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,890
you know,
you remember when David was the king of 

694
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,890
the Jews are so powerful that they 
wouldn't allow any conversions.

695
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,250
Wow.
There were like no one's doing cameras 

696
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,580
get that's deep.
And you guys,

697
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,060
uh,
um,

698
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,510
what do you guys think of Jesus that he 
was a real person,

699
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,920
spoke about things.
He was,

700
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,840
it was a,
like a sort of a wise man,

701
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,870
but they went off the deep end.
So they look down on Christianity for 

702
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,760
choosing Jesus as their savior and Lord.
Uh,

703
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,860
yes,
they're excited that none of those other

704
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,500
shoes.
It's so funny how they're all sort of,

705
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:19,450
kind of connected like Judaism just 
Sorta,

706
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,260
Kinda connected with Christianity 
included.

707
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,800
That's why the,
um,

708
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,040
all the really conservative 
fundamentalist Christians wanted to 

709
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,791
control Israel and support Israel to 
believe in the rapture and they believed

710
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:36,810
that when the shit goes down best place 
to be like you have to protect them,

711
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,550
but they believe that they're wrong.

712
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,190
Even though the Bible says that they're 
the chosen people,

713
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,570
the Christians to go,
yeah,

714
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:43,980
but you guys kept the story.
I'll fucked up.

715
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:48,981
We got it right and don't be an awesome 
thing for the Jews.

716
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,780
If it came out,
the Jesus actually never existed.

717
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,650
Wouldn't be like,
dude,

718
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:57,420
you guys,
he never even existed.

719
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,550
That would have been crushed.
The Christian truth.

720
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,370
Do they have that Jesus documents,
man,

721
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,630
and apparently that's very much a debate
very much in debate.

722
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:12,631
Yeah.
There's a lot of scholars to do not 

723
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,241
believe he was an actual person because 
they believe that Jesus existed but just

724
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:21,051
wasn't mad.
Jews believe that Jesus existed and he 

725
00:37:21,051 --> 00:37:22,410
was mad and it would make it would 
benefit their costs because they'll kill

726
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:25,890
each other if slicing each other.
If you weren't their religion.

727
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:31,650
I believe that they were the former Rep.
the great rabbis would talk about what 

728
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,020
we will do it that makes me think that 
he,

729
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,430
even though there isn't that much proof 
that he actually wants to live in,

730
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,440
there's a lot of holes and that went bed
and the guy that never was all that 

731
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,440
shit.

732
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,510
You.
How come?

733
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,210
How come the Jews and the Muslims don't 
jump on that?

734
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,840
Jesus Christ never existed.
Well,

735
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:51,170
I exactly.
So that makes me think damn.

736
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,160
He probably was a man who was a bad 
motherfucker.

737
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:54,090
Who knows?
Who knows?

738
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,050
But the issue is you can't send false 
prophets.

739
00:37:57,051 --> 00:38:00,900
They said there's many way.
The guy existed for sure.

740
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:02,580
He didn't walk on water and come back 
from the dead.

741
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,910
That was like a.
like someone thinking Bruce Lee could 

742
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,120
really beat up 50 people like Bruce Lee,
the real guy,

743
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,970
and Bruce Lee the superstar to different
people.

744
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:17,060
But it's how many people think their 
life on some story that would not make 

745
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:18,720
any fucking sense.
You told it today,

746
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:24,030
like if you told that story today and 
said there was a dude who walked on 

747
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,570
water and came back from dead.
Everybody wouldn't go.

748
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:26,560
Just shut the fuck up.
That's ridiculous,

749
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,640
but because it's 2000 years ago,
everybody's like,

750
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,660
oh,
that's,

751
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:35,661
you could be happy.
It's not like anything like rational 

752
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:35,980
people that you talk to that would.
There was a

753
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,570
guy that we,
when we're doing fear factor,

754
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,170
who,
uh,

755
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,200
we did a family fear factor.
We came to people's houses and made him 

756
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,450
do things and we traveled all across the
country.

757
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,540
This dude was a teacher.
He was a fucking math teacher and he was

758
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:51,541
telling me like scientifically that,
that Jesus existed because you can prove

759
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:52,830
it because they,
they,

760
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,890
they've looked at molecules that are too
complex to just occurred naturally.

761
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,340
This is a super,
that's a ridiculous argument and this is

762
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:01,780
super,
super smart guy.

763
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,210
And I was listening to them talk,
you know,

764
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,240
supposedly super smart guy and I was 
listening to this guy talking like how 

765
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,370
it is that,
but this guy can't see that.

766
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:14,371
He believes in some reason you can say 
any courses assistant because something 

767
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:17,820
is too amazing to exist.
National debt does not.

768
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:22,821
It's not true system.
I draw a picture of Jesus and with the 

769
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:22,821
capture,
this is Jesus.

770
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:22,821
That's better,
right,

771
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,450
but you can never say that.
Nothing can exist naturally.

772
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:28,600
You don't know the power of nature.
Nature is absolutely ridiculous.

773
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:33,601
Completely unpredictable.
There's subatomic particles that blink 

774
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:35,740
in and out of existence all the time.
They appeared in two places at once.

775
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,540
This is science,
real shit.

776
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,541
We know that exists in nature.
There's the whole pattern of nature is 

777
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:47,670
gigantic.
The FIBONACCI sequence that you see in 

778
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,160
Pine cones and pineapples and all sorts 
of different plants and existence,

779
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:55,170
human facial features,
and this is like a mathematical code to 

780
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,461
all this stuff.
It doesn't mean that there's a fucking 

781
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:02,281
dude pressing the button.
It might mean that the whole thing is 

782
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:05,260
just super complicated and conscious.
They did press in the but that there's a

783
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,420
god,
there's a duke.

784
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,130
We would want to break it down to like 
someone like us.

785
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,020
We want to like make a super version of 
us that's running for.

786
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah,
you're talking about that.

787
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:19,230
The old man with the beard and the sky.
Jesus every.

788
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,400
I'll know for sure.
Of course.

789
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,480
Of course.
That's amazing.

790
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,690
I know of course,
but it sounded like you were saying that

791
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,780
you were describing how wonderful the 
universities and the FIBONACCI theories 

792
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:42,030
and how it's all like this code and 
structure it to be a doctor like.

793
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,660
To me that was like that.
There is an intelligent other side that 

794
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,070
is way too complex for us to understand 
and this is what I don't think it is.

795
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:57,071
I mean it could be that everything has 
an intelligence about what it is as a 

796
00:40:57,071 --> 00:41:01,441
single entity.
I think it's much more likely than an 

797
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:05,490
interconnected thing.
We totally gray slacks like ocean when 

798
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,610
the ocean and then we're like little 
water molecules,

799
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:08,350
but it's the ocean.
It's all.

800
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:13,351
Exactly.
That's what psychedelic experiences we 

801
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:15,691
like.
It feels like you're in the ocean 

802
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:16,891
sometimes.
It feels like you're all connected all 

803
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,650
around you to something that you don't 
see those mushrooms.

804
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,830
I never told you.
I didn't find myself on a fucking 

805
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,820
Thursday night.
I decided to a party by myself.

806
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,920
Did.
I took all those fucking mushrooms.

807
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:31,921
I got pictures and everything and from 
the whole thing,

808
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,050
that wasn't five grands.

809
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,640
No,
no,

810
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,080
no.
It wasn't five.

811
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,480
I've got five grams before that was like
three and a half,

812
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,100
so I did them all myself and I'm just 
want to let you know.

813
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,500
It was.
It was pretty fucking insane.

814
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,610
It was insane,
but not as intense is.

815
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:52,550
It would have been five brands.
It was pretty intense,

816
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:57,551
but the five grants was like dnt.
Five grams really is that threshold 

817
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:57,930
point.
Boom.

818
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,400
That was about a year and a half ago 
when I did the five grams and fucking I 

819
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,630
was at a zoo and I just woke up in the 
zoo.

820
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,150
I thought doing mushrooms at the zoo 
would be fucking awesome.

821
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,890
You know what I mean?
Outdoors.

822
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,500
You did mushrooms,
go out in nature zoo,

823
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,530
but that is like anti nature.
Fuck.

824
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,110
I freaked the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.

825
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,460
You feel like you were in prison if you 
were watching their sorrow for sure.

826
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,480
Like we just had to get the fog out.

827
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,250
Super negative.
Man.

828
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:33,251
I feel terrible when I go to the zoo.
I do not like it at all and it makes me 

829
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,581
feel bad.
I used to enjoy it because I used to 

830
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:38,450
enjoy caring for the animals,
but then one time I went one time when I

831
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:43,340
was super baked and when I did what I 
did when I was super vague,

832
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,550
I got really.
I felt terrible.

833
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,640
I got really sad.
I thought it was a terrible,

834
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:53,360
terrible thing to do or doing was just 
taking these animals and shoving them in

835
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,090
these cages and they don't even get to 
do it and they just pace.

836
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:01,380
Had a polar bear at the La Zoo.
He'll just pace back and forth by that 

837
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,520
back door,
just waiting for that fucking back white

838
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:07,680
door,
like fake ice and then a white dog,

839
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,440
white dog.
That's crazy.

840
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,710
That's horrible.
Man.

841
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,960
Mad and I freaked out.
Went out to the parking lot and this 

842
00:43:20,861 --> 00:43:25,861
chick I was with me,
we did the exact same thing and we saw 

843
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:27,030
the exact same.
We looked at the mountains.

844
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,850
We would stop in the middle of a parking
lot because everything was connected.

845
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,630
It was all connected to look at this 
guy.

846
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:36,850
This guy were dancing before and as tech
writing,

847
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,910
we look at the mountains in the 
distance,

848
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:44,911
like miles away,
like passively in the mountains and all 

849
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:44,911
of a sudden Aztec pattern.
The former,

850
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:45,600
the Aztec pattern.
There's,

851
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:51,110
what are you seeing?
What are you seeing as the Aztec 

852
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:51,700
patterns?
Dense look at stuff.

853
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:56,930
The clouds,
the clouds are in their spot for a 

854
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,210
second and then they formed.
And I remember connor telling me,

855
00:43:58,211 --> 00:44:01,840
because congress is the one who turned 
me onto the dude who had him.

856
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,740
He,
uh,

857
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,110
a sentencing.
He goes,

858
00:44:05,111 --> 00:44:10,111
dude,
it's not the cloud's going to dance for 

859
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,111
you.
Wow.

860
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,690
I didn't even pay attention to that 
really badly.

861
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,090
We get in the fucking car.
Swear to God.

862
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:18,400
I was driving on the freeway freaking 
out.

863
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,500
I didn't know if there was cars next to 
me on the side of me,

864
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,950
but it really did look like as I was 
driving on the freeway,

865
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:28,951
like,
like it wasn't like I was in the what 

866
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:30,070
dreams may come.
Remember that Shit.

867
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,010
I was driving on the and it

868
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
was like rose petals and like bushes 
would form in front of my car.

869
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:39,810
I'm driving really rose pedals and 
bushes.

870
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,520
It was fucking insane by the way.
We don't want to encourage.

871
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,820
I just wanted to get.
I just trying to get home with terrible 

872
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,080
mistake.
Exactly how I want her to do is get them

873
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,120
all getting my little fucking dark room 
and just close my eyes and enjoy that 

874
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,780
life show because that night's show was 
fucking insane.

875
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,220
The twirling.
But you just kind of explain it.

876
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:06,990
It's just fucking.
And that's all I want.

877
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:12,370
I want to see.
Why do you think that you see certain 

878
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:15,291
like religious symbolism and Hindu shit 
and food an I got it from.

879
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,490
You think that's where they must be 
doing mushrooms since the dawn of time.

880
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,640
Of course.
That's when I looked at him like that's 

881
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:25,640
where all this shit comes from.

882
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,180
Alex Grey Shit telling you that's where 
it's coming from.

883
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:33,620
These old like,
you know those things that I have in my 

884
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,560
office,
the Gouda those birds,

885
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,270
you know those,
you know what I'm talking about.

886
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:40,280
And the media room.
I noticed there's crazy psychedelic furs

887
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,140
and when,
when I did the DMT ones much,

888
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:48,170
I saw those things.
I saw like that imagery and then when I 

889
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,350
went to a store and saw them for sale,
I'm like,

890
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,350
oh my God,
whoever created that thing,

891
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,510
like was there.
Like they had to have seen that.

892
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:56,870
Like you could see that first.
You could say,

893
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,050
well why is that?
I don't know.

894
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,340
I mean,
is it something that's already there?

895
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,970
We just can't tune into it until we take
psychedelics?

896
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:09,900
Or is it the same hallucination happens 
to every person that takes a drug.

897
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,240
I think.
I mean,

898
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,650
I don't know.
I think that it's just,

899
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,740
it opens up your sense that somehow to 
this other dimension or all these 

900
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,980
dimensions that are all around us and 
like we're,

901
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,480
we're in a radio and we're only tuned 
into 97 point one.

902
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,510
It has an infinite number of stations.
We're just going into another space 

903
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,670
where that's possible is that I think it
just fucks with the branding.

904
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,200
Two things were possible.
I don't,

905
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:39,480
I don't personally think that.
I don't think that.

906
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,020
I don't think the shit that I'm seeing.
I don't know.

907
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,120
Interesting,
but the shit that with five grand,

908
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,910
five grand,
but the chicken,

909
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,980
what you is for me,
who knows?

910
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:55,010
It seems impossible for me to bring that
up in my brain like it's just the most 

911
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,400
beautifully constructed flowing shapes 
of random and you don't really.

912
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:09,571
You're not high.
You close your eyes and see like random 

913
00:47:09,571 --> 00:47:11,160
blackness and there's no pattern.
It's just like we might see who lit type

914
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,860
flashes of light,
but when you close your eyes,

915
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:17,190
I'm not sure.
All of a sudden there's this show that's

916
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,380
about a thousand times more complex than
that.

917
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:24,381
Visualize it.
You've got an item and that's pretty 

918
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:24,381
fucking cool.
That visualized.

919
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:28,750
It's in that same vein but a thousand 
times more complex way more complex and 

920
00:47:29,231 --> 00:47:29,620
I'm like,

921
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,280
I'm not designing this.
I'm not controlling this.

922
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,490
There's someone else controlling someone
else's making this shit,

923
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,730
not me.
It seems like that's definitely one 

924
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,311
option,
but another option is that stuff 

925
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:46,910
supercharges your perceptions and just 
makes your imagination more 

926
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:51,451
hypersensitive and it makes your brain 
go wild because it reacts with,

927
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,360
you know,
the size that you use to see things as a

928
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:55,870
parasite.

929
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,240
It lives in the sewers and it only feeds
on cat springs.

930
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,780
So what it does is it took a worm,
right?

931
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,130
Yeah.
But it lets.

932
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,160
I'm a rat,
Ethan and the at Burlington the brain 

933
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,861
and the only thing that changes the wrap
to the church and their behavior at all 

934
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:12,920
except it takes their way,
their fear of cats.

935
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:18,750
So they will get eaten by a cab.
Everything else saying they gave and 

936
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,310
when they see a capital like,
oh,

937
00:48:19,311 --> 00:48:20,630
what's up?
Nothing major.

938
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,810
Cat kills it.
Uh,

939
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,590
yeah.
That's incredible.

940
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,970
And that's his brains.
I know.

941
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,540
Totally fine.
We talked about this one on the show.

942
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:32,000
The other one that they do where there's
a worm that gets inside of grasshopper,

943
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:37,010
convinced the grasshopper,
he commit suicide so that it can hatch 

944
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,111
out of the spot it grows and how it gets
it teaches the grasshopper to jump into 

945
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,460
the water and kill itself.
It's an aquatic warm,

946
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,360
so it has to be hatched in the fucking 
water or things like that.

947
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:51,340
That's just crazy.
That's just like existing on a whole new

948
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:56,341
level of like,
just that alone right there is so 

949
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:58,810
fucking amazing.
It's so amazing.

950
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,910
It's just another like,
you know,

951
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:05,080
there's something going on.
They started growing up I think.

952
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:06,370
Well there's definitely something going 
on,

953
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:09,940
but I think our,
our idea that our culture is based on,

954
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,820
it's just that we wanted to be close to 
us.

955
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,580
We want it to be like a super version of
us,

956
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:19,060
which is why would a,
God is like a super version of a human,

957
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,820
but you know,
with all these rules and God is,

958
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:26,821
you know,
fucking kind of addictive and gets 

959
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:29,281
pissed at you if you fuck up and a lot 
of religions is willing to kill you if 

960
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:29,870
you don't listen to them.

961
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,440
You know,
we want it like a super version of box,

962
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:37,450
but it's much more possible that this,
this whole thing is just connected to 

963
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:39,540
something that you can't stop.
You know,

964
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,560
some big,
powerful thing that feeds off itself.

965
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:44,430
All,
every,

966
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,500
everything.
This world has a role and plays a part 

967
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,470
in this thing.
It's just we're used to it.

968
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:55,620
We don't realize how funny it really 
fucking is because we're used to it 

969
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,250
because it's just a normal part of our 
day and people get used to anything.

970
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,400
People in Africa have giant plates.
They stick in their lips and all the 

971
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,490
girls do it.
They're used to it.

972
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:08,550
We just get used to stupid shit and once
we're used to something then 

973
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,310
everything's become spine.
And then we think that there's some sort

974
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:10,660
of a grand order.
Things,

975
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:12,540
you know,
it's,

976
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,900
it's really getting weirder and weirder.
As I got older,

977
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,360
as I got older and I look at,
you know,

978
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,090
our culture and I look at life on this 
planet.

979
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,090
I look at my own mortality,
you know,

980
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,840
the fact that I'm like,
you know,

981
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:27,930
the next half of my life is going to be 
half of my life were.

982
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:29,750
My buddies will work good.
You know,

983
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,810
that's just the way it is.
Getting close to dying.

984
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,050
You know you're going to have health 
issues if you don't watch your diet,

985
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,330
you know you're going to make.
You have to make sure you get the proper

986
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:42,290
sleep or you might get heart attacks and
shit like things start going wrong.

987
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:47,650
Even when you,
when you really start assessing this 

988
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:47,650
whole big picture of what this really is
like,

989
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,720
God,
it's like I feel I've been flying 

990
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,420
without a manual for so long,
like just operating my life.

991
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:58,750
Not really having any idea how to do it 
correctly just but learning from my fuck

992
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,700
ups starting from scratch.
We look.

993
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,900
I feel like there's such.
It's going to be a way better way to 

994
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,901
learn life than the way we do it.
So is there a time you can get yourself 

995
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:15,110
and your own personality figured out and
you're rolling the way he interacts with

996
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:15,740
people,
figuring out.

997
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:17,870
By the time you get that figured out so 
god,

998
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:18,740
you're already dying

999
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,870
age.
They think,

1000
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,360
Oh,
if I know what I do now,

1001
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,990
and I go back to that age and you get 
laid so much.

1002
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:26,880
Oh God,
yeah.

1003
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,470
Yeah.
Look like you were 34,

1004
00:51:29,471 --> 00:51:32,010
like 30 years.
Yeah.

1005
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:37,110
Let we figured that shit on now.
More advancement.

1006
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:43,590
Skincare for men.
It seems like you're not supposed to 

1007
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:47,041
live long enough to figure this out.
It seems like the reason why turtles 

1008
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:50,671
live to be a thousand years old and 
people live to be 100 is because we're 

1009
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:52,730
not supposed to have a thousand years 
toward us.

1010
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:55,930
Discovery,
all the funding,

1011
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:02,010
little geographic today,

1012
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:09,490
thousand years old.
So they literally lived like back when 

1013
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,830
people were writing fucking what was the
thousand year old kid?

1014
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,530
They should put like little black box

1015
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:22,100
you to write everything out on paper.
I've written out a thousand years ago.

1016
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:24,630
They might've been doing on animal skins
to a lot.

1017
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,050
No,
that's crazy.

1018
00:52:28,051 --> 00:52:33,051
You know like the Dead Sea Scrolls.
That shit was all written on animal 

1019
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:35,601
skins.
Those motherfuckers didn't even know 

1020
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:36,510
paper.
They didn't even have paper back.

1021
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,110
There could be a dead sea.
Scroll on a fucking turtle.

1022
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,260
I wish I knew for sure who's

1023
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,770
telling the truth about the Dead Sea 
scrolls because I don't have enough time

1024
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:52,080
to learn ancient Hebrew or what does an 
era.

1025
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:57,081
Man,
I can go back and read the Dead Sea 

1026
00:52:57,081 --> 00:52:57,780
Scrolls and decipher for myself,
but there's all this dispute on what the

1027
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,110
Dead Sea Scrolls actually means and some
people say that it contains all kinds of

1028
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:05,980
nutty shit like fucking Ufo shows and 
flying saucers and I mean there's,

1029
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,250
there's guys who have decided from the 
Dead Sea Scrolls,

1030
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,700
like the John Marco Lego guy says it's 
all about mushrooms.

1031
00:53:11,701 --> 00:53:16,701
You said it was about was them.
Even the them scary mushroom and 

1032
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:19,440
fertility rituals and he breaks it all 
down like the origins of the words,

1033
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:23,580
but people argue against him and I don't
know who's right.

1034
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:28,790
It's too fucking live there on ABC.
They all the best scientists on the 

1035
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:31,260
planet and all the best linguists they 
get together.

1036
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:36,380
That should be important.
That's discipleship in front of the 

1037
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:36,870
world as a satellite feed from fucking

1038
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,120
allegro passed away.
The Guy who wrote that book,

1039
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:46,121
but he was the.
He was the one of the head guys for the 

1040
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:48,170
Dead Sea Scrolls.
You worked on it for 14 years and he was

1041
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:50,600
the only agnostic in the group.
You know,

1042
00:53:50,601 --> 00:53:55,601
they had a bunch of people that were 
ordained ministers and they were to 

1043
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:58,541
decipher is then we're all religious 
people and he started out a religious 

1044
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:02,291
person,
but when you started studying theology 

1045
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:04,510
you realized somewhere along the line is
obviously bullshit and she just became 

1046
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:05,510
agnostic,
so he looked at the whole,

1047
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,750
the whole picture completely different 
than all the other guys.

1048
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:12,850
So they all were refuted his findings.
But there's a lot of people that say 

1049
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:13,340
he's right and a lot of people will say 
that.

1050
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:16,030
He was the head scholar.
He was the number one dude.

1051
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:21,031
If he was the guy who had it all,
like he was the guy who was looking at 

1052
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:24,491
it objectively and everybody else was 
looking at it with a religious slant 

1053
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:24,590
because fucking guys thinks it was all 
about mushrooms.

1054
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,440
It was all about psychedelic mushrooms 
that they would do it,

1055
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:32,470
hide these mushrooms from the Romans,
and they would hide like what does the 

1056
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,160
magic and with the mushrooms can do and 
the way they hid it from him,

1057
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,150
Mrs.
Stories.

1058
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,880
And they didn't even write it down for 
like a thousand years.

1059
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:40,880
They just told each other as a story for
a thousand years,

1060
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,870
so it just became all fucked up and so 
he breaks down like ancient words.

1061
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,020
Keith,
he broke down the word Christ.

1062
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:53,130
He brought it back to an ancient 
Sumerian word that means a mushroom 

1063
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,800
covered in God's semen.
Nice.

1064
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,260
Because they,
when they thought it was raining,

1065
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:02,310
I was coming on the earth.
That's why things would come up out of 

1066
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,740
the earth,
like come wasn't bad debt.

1067
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:07,310
So like when God would reign and he was 
coming on the earth,

1068
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,920
these mushrooms would just appear 
because they didn't have microscopes,

1069
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,680
they didn't know what a fucking lie a 
spore is.

1070
00:55:12,681 --> 00:55:16,250
They couldn't see microscopic things,
so they didn't see any seed or anything.

1071
00:55:16,251 --> 00:55:21,251
And also these big mushrooms appeared 
like the next day they grow quick and 

1072
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,270
they start eating them and they tripped 
their fucking balls.

1073
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,160
They don't want anybody else to know 
about this.

1074
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:30,430
So they tried to hide the information.
They were told either a high keeping it 

1075
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:30,980
from their enemies.
Wow.

1076
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,430
Isn't that nuts?
God Zurich it off.

1077
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:39,070
Isn't that.
That's how they used to look at him or 

1078
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:39,070
did he pull out some guidance

1079
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:45,340
somehow?
You've got to figure out,

1080
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,840
Daddy,
you got to

1081
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:53,490
so good to have a baby right now.
Think about how good it feels to have a 

1082
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:53,490
baby right now.
It's an amazing,

1083
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,610
incredible feelings,
but most babies now,

1084
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,680
they live.
They live to be grownups,

1085
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,740
ups to be adults.
They don't have to worry about them 

1086
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,600
getting eaten by lions.
You don't have to worry about plague,

1087
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:10,770
but the people that live back then had 
the same love for the kids as we do now,

1088
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,220
but they couldn't help it,
so there were people were dying left and

1089
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:19,221
right,
but there's nothing you can do to stop 

1090
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:19,221
it.
That must have been nuts,

1091
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:21,360
man.
That must've been fucking horrifying.

1092
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,500
Having kids just got well,
must be why they had all these rituals.

1093
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,960
It was fertility.
Rituals are so important.

1094
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,850
They wanted to have as many kids as 
possible.

1095
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:39,390
Roman times,
50 percent perhaps the people that have 

1096
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:40,120
the damn before,
what?

1097
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,860
Adulthood that's can get it.
Only half of them make it turned out 

1098
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,350
that the condition he imagined what it 
was or something like that.

1099
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,130
That was on discovery.
So I don't know.

1100
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:56,160
The history channel.
Don't quote me on that.

1101
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,940
Like oh no,
that makes sense.

1102
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,490
I don't remember that.
Even if it wasn't 50 percent,

1103
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:05,491
it had to be a high number.
I mean they just didn't have someone 

1104
00:57:05,491 --> 00:57:05,800
check that mortality rate and Roman 
times.

1105
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,430
I think it's 50 percent could be wrong.
Dude,

1106
00:57:09,431 --> 00:57:13,480
I've had two major surgeries.
Both my knees reconstructed,

1107
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,890
both acs and one more minor surgery.
My meniscus surgery on my hand,

1108
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:19,920
but if I lived,
you know,

1109
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,610
thousand years ago,
I'd be fucked,

1110
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,900
man.
That'd be fucked.

1111
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,650
You wouldn't be doing Jujitsu?
No.

1112
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,590
That wouldn't have happened to run into 
him.

1113
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:31,730
Plan to work it.
You learned have been a softball 

1114
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:32,890
champions.

1115
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,360
Softball.
I smashed my biggest.

1116
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:43,570
There's guys out there.
They're fucking champions in softball.

1117
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,710
Like they're the fucking Mark Mcguire.
A softball.

1118
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,480
There's guys out there.
We'll do this.

1119
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:53,110
That create those.
Who is the Hicks and Gracie to find that

1120
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:54,020
out.
It's been great.

1121
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:59,030
So softball that.
How accurate can you be when you whip 

1122
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,610
that fucking thing around?
It looks dope.

1123
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:02,190
That's nuts.
Then checks because it all.

1124
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,100
I don't think I've ever seen the chicks 
throw that hard regular.

1125
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,280
Have you ever seen a chick throw it was 
clearly the right way to do it?

1126
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,760
Yeah.
Why did they throw into narrative that's

1127
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,070
like,
no,

1128
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,180
it's like it's like breaking the balls 
and pool.

1129
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,370
You know how you try to break the balls 
really hard.

1130
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:23,610
She wants like a little person.
They have like a loose wrist and just 

1131
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,520
smash is like a timing to it where 
they're just knowing exactly how to put 

1132
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:26,680
their weight into it and just not like.

1133
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:34,370
It's weird,
like Jujitsu should straighten things 

1134
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:34,540
when it comes to techniques and it's 
like the more you do techniques,

1135
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,790
the more those techniques just becoming 
grain,

1136
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:41,791
the way your body moves.
Your body just gets really good at the 

1137
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,940
movement so you can teach your body 
move,

1138
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:47,980
which is like a j.
shows control and credible founder Dan 

1139
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,580
Henderson is a monster.
He took.

1140
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,350
First of all,
I'm just impressed.

1141
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:58,090
Fuck these first round.
The first round he got face planted.

1142
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,840
He got bold,
lasted like Henderson on the button.

1143
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:02,440
Oh,
I do.

1144
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,870
I erased it.
I arranged it.

1145
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,750
Henderson hit him on the bus.
You have erased it.

1146
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:11,940
You get it online.
We can get it online.

1147
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,090
Most will watch captured.

1148
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,970
Henderson faceplant face plants a field,
so blindly die for it.

1149
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:27,580
He got cracked and Dan Henderson hits 
him again for hard upper cut to an end.

1150
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,940
It goes down again.
He got fucked up and that first one 

1151
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,010
chance.
But Danny came on strong in the second 

1152
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,901
round and the tennis shoes started fade 
a little bit and jake shields started 

1153
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:39,350
taking them down,
fucking controlling them.

1154
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:40,820
And they were saying that,
uh,

1155
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,950
that Henderson has been having problems 
with his back.

1156
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,350
So you know,
he looked kind of stiff.

1157
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:47,270
That could have been what's going on.
It could have been why couldn't,

1158
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,640
couldn't stuff that take job,
but pants,

1159
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:54,660
shields a good total control mountain.
I'm just a mountain of over and over 

1160
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,420
again.
And Henderson could not shake him,

1161
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,290
couldn't finish them,
and never went for one arm bar.

1162
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:03,770
But that's it.
Sports is 100 point.

1163
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,320
Oh my goodness.
I have A.

1164
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,840
Yeah.
This is ridiculous.

1165
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:12,020
We're not supposed to do I for 20.
It's time to order pizza.

1166
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:12,900
No,
wait,

1167
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:18,190
can we just tv know it just takes.
They don't give a shit.

1168
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:23,210
They do though.
Is people listening to this on itunes to

1169
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,770
at this point in time that already like,
are we allowed to go?

1170
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,210
I bet no one says no one.
It's like,

1171
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:29,890
yeah dude,

1172
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,320
they're all looking at.
Go for it.

1173
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,480
Please.
Fuck.

1174
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,690
I need to get more pizza.
Pizza,

1175
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:54,260
everyone.
How come you haven't gotten an operation

1176
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:57,780
that your eyeballs fixed?
Fuck you guys.

1177
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,210
Fuck you.
Happy three 87.

1178
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,950
Hey,
how come you haven't got your eyeballs?

1179
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,870
Scared of that now and I'm not scared at
all.

1180
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:11,280
I just haven't done it.
Would you want to do with about you?

1181
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,330
Contrast is just so easy.
Like I don't even know that I never even

1182
01:01:15,331 --> 01:01:20,331
got caught.
Sometimes they might contacts in three 

1183
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:21,050
or four days and shit I don't think 
you're supposed to,

1184
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,410
but they don't.
You want to get them fixed.

1185
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:27,910
Have the context.
Tells me that I'm making up little 

1186
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:32,550
things in your I now you can see better 
how it is.

1187
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:37,660
That means seeing is so fucking 
important and you can fix it with a 

1188
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,690
little piece of plastic.
How did they figure that shit?

1189
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:42,510
I didn't figure out contact.
Someone figured that out.

1190
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,530
Jensen and to the counselor.
I want to say a documentary to think 

1191
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,760
about what all the shit that people can 
do right now.

1192
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:01,360
It's getting so crazy.
What the fuck is going to be the next 

1193
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,390
big thing because no one saw the 
internet coming,

1194
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:08,660
you know?
No one ever thought it was going to 

1195
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,311
affect people the way it's affecting the
human race right now because if they 

1196
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:11,460
did,
they would've never let it get out.

1197
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:12,330
No,
no,

1198
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:17,440
no.
Corporations would have ever wanted the 

1199
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:17,440
internet.
It's too tricky.

1200
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,930
It was too hard to control.
It's too.

1201
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,040
What?
What the fuck is gonna be?

1202
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:24,030
The next thing is this isn't going to be
the last day of the grantor.

1203
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,660
That's it.

1204
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:33,540
Going to be like Hologram laptops where 
you're just going to need like maybe a 

1205
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:37,710
little little block and then it just 
blows up or something.

1206
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,570
It's going to be New Orleans just 
happened.

1207
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:47,680
I think it's going to be neural implants
or the other idea that I had was not a 

1208
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,221
normal implant,
but that they figured out the frequency 

1209
01:02:52,221 --> 01:02:54,981
of your brain.
Like what if they beat your brain 

1210
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:55,110
towards like a wifi signal,
but what if your brain,

1211
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,200
like obviously you know,
input comes into your brain in the form 

1212
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,431
of hearing things and seeing things and 
these electrical impulses or wherever 

1213
01:03:04,431 --> 01:03:08,331
the hell sight and sound is created and 
how you represent that stuff in your 

1214
01:03:08,331 --> 01:03:11,631
head that's like,
those are like signals that are coming 

1215
01:03:11,631 --> 01:03:11,631
in from,
from Your Eyes,

1216
01:03:11,631 --> 01:03:14,670
from your ordinance.
What if there's a way to get that signal

1217
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:19,760
out into the air.
So instead of having to be directly 

1218
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:22,410
input into your brain with,
you know,

1219
01:03:22,411 --> 01:03:23,730
with just a,
you know,

1220
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,950
with site signals and with,
you know,

1221
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:26,480
the,
the,

1222
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:27,920
the signals that your ears giving.

1223
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,890
What if there's a way to tune into the 
whole mind like a Wifi,

1224
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:36,891
but some sort of neural implant or 
something that activates a certain 

1225
01:03:36,891 --> 01:03:40,500
portion of the brain and literally 
allows your brain to tune in to everyone

1226
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:45,501
else's brain.
Like we all like share a giant hard 

1227
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:47,010
drive,
like that totally seems possible.

1228
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:52,460
It seems to me like they're just.
They just have to figure out how that 

1229
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,880
would work and what kind of a frequency 
that would operate under,

1230
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
but if they can,
they can introduce all sorts of things 

1231
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,000
in the people's brains.
This guy,

1232
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,640
they did an operation on him and they 
stimulated a part of his brain and he 

1233
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,270
started there were,
I forget what they were trying to do.

1234
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,630
It was this was an accident,
but in stimulating part of his brain,

1235
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,960
he started remembering shit from his 
childhood,

1236
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,720
like in graphic detail.

1237
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,530
It was happening right there,
right in front of them.

1238
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,250
Like they literally figured out how to 
charge and jumpstart your memories.

1239
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,940
You know,
I think I do shit like that,

1240
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:29,100
but they can.
They can introduce thoughts to people's 

1241
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,431
minds.
They can read vision that can revision 

1242
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:33,561
now.
They can put little things on your head 

1243
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:36,830
and you look at something and a computer
will show an image of what you're 

1244
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,160
looking at.
That's incredible.

1245
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,490
It's not good.
It's not good image.

1246
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,930
They haven't figured it out good yet,
but if you read letters,

1247
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,740
you can see the letter and a picture.
Kathy.

1248
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:47,910
Not yet.
Not yet,

1249
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,610
but it's close.
Well then there'll be able to figure out

1250
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,190
like memories tariff.
Exactly.

1251
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:57,660
Close to world.
If we've realized that,

1252
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:01,470
you know,
memories are completely unpredictable.

1253
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,910
That memories are,
they,

1254
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:05,300
they're so easy to scramble.
You know,

1255
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:10,310
when,
when you think about like how much of 

1256
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:11,180
human history was just written down and 
spoken on memories,

1257
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,340
memory,
arguing with somebody about something.

1258
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,120
Something happened and they're like,
that's not what happened.

1259
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,400
You know,
like,

1260
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:23,401
you know what?
We're just remembering and I have no 

1261
01:05:23,401 --> 01:05:23,401
idea if I'm the one that's wrong or they
are.

1262
01:05:23,401 --> 01:05:26,390
But it's like,
I'd like to say like,

1263
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:27,150
no,
no,

1264
01:05:27,151 --> 01:05:28,180
no,
you're remembering it wrong,

1265
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:30,970
but it's like,
why do I think I'm the one you gotta you

1266
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:31,840
gotta be real careful

1267
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:37,040
that I went back to my home where I grew
up in and I hadn't been there in like 10

1268
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:39,530
years ago and I remembered everything 
different.

1269
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:44,540
Man,
I'll never forget that my house look 

1270
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:44,540
different.
The fucking street looked different.

1271
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:48,741
I thought this.
I thought the staircase was on a 

1272
01:05:48,741 --> 01:05:48,960
different side of the street,
like I had it all fucked up in my head.

1273
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,440
That's where I went to the place that I 
lived at when I was three and an 

1274
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:54,440
apartment.
Then my dad got.

1275
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,810
My mom was exactly.
I was shocked with the numbers go.

1276
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,830
Different places changed though,
you know,

1277
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,020
knock down a building and changed it 
around.

1278
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:06,150
You don't know.
That building was exactly the same.

1279
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:10,020
Like how old were you when you got three
year olds?

1280
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:14,930
Maybe four images from three.
That's out of me.

1281
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:17,660
But anyway,
the street look at the Safeway.

1282
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:21,930
Safeway used to be there at this time.
You're remembering having,

1283
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:25,180
remember remembering the memory about a 
year ago,

1284
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:30,181
and then you remember the year that you 
remember your memory of the

1285
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:36,790
have those individual members for ours.
We're thinking about one little thing 

1286
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:38,730
can throw you off and then it shifts 
your idea of,

1287
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,760
oh no,
that's not what happened and this 

1288
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,641
happened,
and then all of a sudden you see it 

1289
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:48,201
better,
but you were just committed to the way 

1290
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:48,201
you saw 10 seconds was the incorrect 
way.

1291
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:50,940
It's not fucking reliable enough.
That's what I was thinking.

1292
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:55,941
What does what I was thinking before 
about like people like the reason why 

1293
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:58,761
turtles,
turtles live to be 100 years and people 

1294
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:01,111
will live to be 100 is I don't think you
can keep our purpose going and keep us 

1295
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:07,131
living because the way society seems to 
work best is if people don't live long 

1296
01:07:07,131 --> 01:07:07,890
enough to figure out that it's all 
bullshit,

1297
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,390
you know?
Because if they do,

1298
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:12,270
then chaos,
restructuring,

1299
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:16,920
everything goes to a different way and 
that's not the way that humans are going

1300
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:18,030
right now and the way we're going.

1301
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:20,730
It's like some sort of a global 
domination thing,

1302
01:07:20,731 --> 01:07:23,430
some sort of a technological singularity
thing.

1303
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,140
We're moving further and further and 
further.

1304
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:30,310
If we were able to step back and as a 
culture get old enough to realize how 

1305
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,600
silly that all is and realized how much 
better life would be if we all just 

1306
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,320
relaxed and shared resources and be nice
to each other and treat the world as if 

1307
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,920
it were friends and work this all out 
together,

1308
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:46,070
but nothing would ever get done.
Things get done because people are 

1309
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:46,140
competing when people competing,
people hate the other people.

1310
01:07:46,141 --> 01:07:51,141
They're competing against,
whether it's countries or companies or 

1311
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:51,830
political parties or anything,
so when,

1312
01:07:51,831 --> 01:07:53,310
when,
when that kind of shit happens,

1313
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:56,910
that competition is why we made newer 
and better things.

1314
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:02,030
If there was no competition like that,
it wouldn't be the pressure to be the 

1315
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:02,030
best at everything.

1316
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:06,110
If you didn't hate the other people,
there wouldn't be this pressure to 

1317
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:09,171
dominate them and crush them,
but can live in a world like the Amazon 

1318
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,060
Indians can the whole world.
Well,

1319
01:08:11,061 --> 01:08:13,890
there's some reason why those dudes are 
still running around with fucking pieces

1320
01:08:13,891 --> 01:08:18,891
of animal flesh.
Covering Dick is don't know if it's 

1321
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:18,891
wrong.
I mean,

1322
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:19,580
that's right.
Maybe it is.

1323
01:08:19,581 --> 01:08:21,270
It's certainly an alternative,
but I think.

1324
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:26,630
I think we have to look at human nature 
as being natural and I think that if we 

1325
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:30,801
look at everything else being natural,
we look at the way you behave and the 

1326
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:34,491
way you know a monkey's behave.
We look at their simple lives as being 

1327
01:08:34,491 --> 01:08:38,571
natural.
While we look at the course of humanity 

1328
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:38,571
is being natural,
we're.

1329
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:40,470
We're pretending that it's something 
that we all consciously control,

1330
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,690
but if we do,
why is it so fucked up?

1331
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:47,690
Still?
Why is there's so much political 

1332
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:47,690
corruption when we know there's so much 
political corruption,

1333
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:50,250
why are we still going to war?
What we know?

1334
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:53,190
We know that wars are ridiculous and 
that their only ways for profit.

1335
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,240
Why do you keep continuing along the 
same lines?

1336
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,010
Even though rationally we must know a 
certain point in time,

1337
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,590
this is an insane way to live.
Well,

1338
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:03,630
maybe it's because that's just the way 
people live.

1339
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,560
I believe we're moving towards with 
that,

1340
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:11,190
that this behavior pushes us toward 
something.

1341
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:15,420
It pushes us towards creation of 
something global practice.

1342
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,500
Something,
some,

1343
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:20,220
some end of wrong little worlds 
thinking,

1344
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,390
you know,
it's all about us,

1345
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,130
but meanwhile,
you know,

1346
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:25,160
whatever's going on,
you're just like an end.

1347
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:30,170
You're just producing an editor.
Zinc that's needs to collectively do 

1348
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:34,071
something world or something.
But we got our labs and it goes to what 

1349
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:35,220
would our was Ari was saying about the 
parent's side,

1350
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:40,490
like think about that.
Think about the animal that this 

1351
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,960
parasite,
the parasite lives and has no fucking 

1352
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:42,960
idea.
You know,

1353
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,930
they have no idea where to distance at 
all.

1354
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:48,650
That has no idea that cat has no idea 
what it is.

1355
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,730
I mean,
the whole thing is bananas.

1356
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,760
It's finance.
It's all interconnected.

1357
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:54,420
Yeah.

1358
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,730
Is it as possible?
So make those crazy cat ladies too.

1359
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:01,250
Is it a few people aren't immune to the 
fucking Paris.

1360
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,280
I don't know why there is a certain cap 
parasite that is infected.

1361
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
A tremendous amount of the female 
population in Brazil and a bunch of a 

1362
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,350
bunch of other countries.
And this is um,

1363
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:16,340
a,
uh,

1364
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:19,400
actual parasite that makes women more 
docile.

1365
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:20,070
Hmm.

1366
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:24,650
Probably the same thing.
It was a no fear.

1367
01:10:24,651 --> 01:10:27,220
I have to look that up because I 
remember that.

1368
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:27,700
It,
it,

1369
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:32,780
it does sound like that shit.
I know why women in Brazil.

1370
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:37,260
I have to find this.
I have to Google this right now.

1371
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,480
This,
this is too,

1372
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:43,570
too strange.
I have to find this out because I can't 

1373
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:43,570
remember what it was when I read it.

1374
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,960
Parasite in Brazil.
Cats,

1375
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,640
women.
I got to find this fucking article,

1376
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:59,460
mood altering cat parasites make women 
friendly and manage the jerks.

1377
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,840
Dude,
that's Brazil jerks.

1378
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,880
I mean,
think about how many,

1379
01:11:03,881 --> 01:11:04,690
uh,
how many,

1380
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,390
uh,
really friendly girls come from Brazil.

1381
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:10,420
And how many super aggressive dudes.
That's hilarious.

1382
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,410
Yeah.
If you look up what Google would,

1383
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:15,210
I looked up,
um,

1384
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:15,870
you,
uh,

1385
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,360
you come up with a quite a few articles 
about it.

1386
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:21,660
It's a parasite that causes rats to 
sacrifice himself to cats.

1387
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:26,750
May also change human behavior,
making women more outgoing and warm 

1388
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,310
hearted and men more jealous and 
suspicious.

1389
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:34,670
The toxo plasma protest is a shed,
a shed and cat feces which are then 

1390
01:11:36,211 --> 01:11:41,211
eaten by rats,
infected rasp become fearless and the 

1391
01:11:41,211 --> 01:11:42,300
presence of cats,
which makes them easier to catch,

1392
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:45,060
which in turn spreads the disease to new
cats.

1393
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:50,090
Holy Shit.
It makes women nicer and it makes them 

1394
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:50,190
Douche bags.

1395
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:53,290
That's hilarious.
Nature is totally rooting against us.

1396
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,530
Finding new ways to keep a fucked up.
How crazy is that,

1397
01:11:58,531 --> 01:11:59,850
man?
How crazy is that?

1398
01:11:59,851 --> 01:12:04,680
Because men who are more douchey are 
more likely to fuck a bunch of different

1399
01:12:04,681 --> 01:12:08,880
women and and impregnate them like fuck 
they're friends women and you know,

1400
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,920
you know what I'm saying?
Like the more Douchey guy guidance,

1401
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,750
the more he's got to do like creepy 
shit.

1402
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:17,780
Go get laid.
So the more likely that's gonna make 

1403
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:17,780
like excellence.
Some babies all over the place,

1404
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:22,230
it's going to keep spreading the eye.
Maybe a nature likes Douche bags.

1405
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,530
Well it's like it goes back to what I 
said,

1406
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:30,531
it's like,
it's almost like you don't really 

1407
01:12:30,531 --> 01:12:32,250
achieve unless there's competition and 
competition doesn't really mean anything

1408
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,080
unless it's competition.
Like,

1409
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,460
like primal,
you know,

1410
01:12:35,461 --> 01:12:40,461
a man who hate to you hate him and he 
hates you and it really forces you to 

1411
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:40,461
work hard.

1412
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:45,320
You know?
That's why companies fucking hate each 

1413
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,571
other.
Companies that compete against each 

1414
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:47,670
other or rarely friendly,
they fucking hate each other.

1415
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:52,790
Maybe they're supposed to.
Maybe that's the most efficient way to 

1416
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,790
get things done.
You have to light a fire under someone's

1417
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:54,720
ass in order to get the most 
productivity out of them.

1418
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:59,780
Hey equals productivity.
It's like your life would certainly be 

1419
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,860
better off if you didn't have that,
that,

1420
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:01,830
that,
you know,

1421
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:06,890
that aspect too,
but you wouldn't be a successful aspect 

1422
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:06,890
to you though.
So,

1423
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:10,590
uh,
so it's like a fucked up shit like war,

1424
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,860
you know,
that's how it's supposed to happen.

1425
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:16,770
That's a,
that's a terrible conclusion to terrible

1426
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:20,160
conclusion.
But it might be that everything we do is

1427
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:24,240
the way we're supposed to do it.
They have a jealous for war.

1428
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,810
It's not,
I want to do it,

1429
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,710
but someone's gonna do it,
you know,

1430
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:33,570
it's just the way they've been doing 
business forever.

1431
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:38,570
It's going to take way too long for that
to settle down all these people that 

1432
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:38,660
promise that they're not going to have 
war anymore.

1433
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:43,830
But I've looked at Obama,
he promised that he was going to stop 

1434
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:46,371
all this.
Who's going to pull people out and just 

1435
01:13:46,371 --> 01:13:49,770
more in the never George Bush playing 
golf,

1436
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,910
you know,
Obama's or play more golf.

1437
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:56,850
And George Bush has,
I think it's the first term,

1438
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,810
first year he played 33 times.
I said,

1439
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:02,610
George,
I think a lot of flack for 20th times.

1440
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,090
Obama's a very smart guy,
very good speaker.

1441
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:11,070
That's really all I all I have to say.
Other than that,

1442
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,070
I'm not

1443
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:17,070
seeing anything different.
She stopped doing the things he said he 

1444
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:17,070
would do.
You know,

1445
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:21,781
I don't know about the stimulus package.
I don't know what's going really happen 

1446
01:14:21,781 --> 01:14:24,811
with that or whether that's because 
that's too fucking complicated and no 

1447
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,560
one bothered.
Nah,

1448
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,680
fuck it.
Well,

1449
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,150
maybe documentary.
My problem.

1450
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,680
My problem with all this stuff is where,
where do I put my attention?

1451
01:14:39,681 --> 01:14:42,230
How much time do I have in a day?
What do I want to think about?

1452
01:14:42,231 --> 01:14:43,910
Do I want to concentrate on?
Oh,

1453
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:46,080
how are they fucking us?
Oh wait,

1454
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,720
where's this more?
It was more corruption.

1455
01:14:47,721 --> 01:14:48,650
Come in.
What is this?

1456
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:52,330
Do I really want to focus on that?
Focus on the fucking November ballot.

1457
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,750
They legalized pot completely.

1458
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:58,190
That would be insane.
Is that valid ren?

1459
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:02,430
Eddie and myself are medical patients.
We are a California.

1460
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,010
Yeah,
we're all sick.

1461
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,130
I,
uh,

1462
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,100
I,
uh,

1463
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:13,360
I've gotten injured up two surgeries.
It's all real and it's a nice calming 

1464
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,620
agent for you,
like during the day.

1465
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:20,360
It's a perspective of answer,
right?

1466
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:22,280
I just do it for the insomnia.

1467
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,450
I say I don't smoke pot all the time.
I just smoked before.

1468
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:31,070
I have sex before I do comedy.
Before.

1469
01:15:31,071 --> 01:15:34,570
Why comedy for Jujitsu before I know I'm
going to eat something delicious.

1470
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:38,800
So it's not all the time.
It's just before cool shit to make it.

1471
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,430
I almost feel like that whenever I'm 
like,

1472
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:46,630
Oh,
let me make this better and then I'll 

1473
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,630
get the burrito the first time that he 
got up to me.

1474
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,330
Hi can we went and got an ice cream 
Sundae?

1475
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,960
Uh,
so went on stage that night.

1476
01:15:53,961 --> 01:15:58,961
And you were talking about how great 
that ice cream Sundae wise was the 

1477
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:02,531
greatest thing ever.
You've wrote material about how good it 

1478
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:02,760
tastes so good.
Right in,

1479
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:04,760
right away.
The material made more sense.

1480
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:08,260
Like I could write material right there.
By the first time I got home,

1481
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:13,390
by the way,
the iron sheik smoke weed only during 

1482
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:15,200
his big fights before all hulk Hogan 
fights.

1483
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,010
That's so crazy.
That's.

1484
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:23,130
He said he likes it.
He likes smoking weed after he trains at

1485
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:29,600
after he wrestles,
unless it's a big macs and bob back when

1486
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:32,090
all the whole Hogan.
He was always high during.

1487
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:38,880
He knows a lot about what he knows his 
shit.

1488
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,100
He knows a lot of other shit too.
But the sheet is upon it.

1489
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:49,101
And I got,
I got a fucking 45 minutes worth of 

1490
01:16:49,101 --> 01:16:51,860
interview with them.
I might start posting these.

1491
01:16:51,861 --> 01:16:56,861
Right.
You weren't there when I tell the story 

1492
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:56,861
and I said I,
I walked in towards the end of it,

1493
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:58,220
uh,
my buddy Danny calls me up and goes,

1494
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:03,280
dude,
I'm gonna fucking meet Ian Cheek right 

1495
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:03,280
now.
How the fuck did that happen?

1496
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,050
Because he's in town for like the calm,
calm or what a comic,

1497
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,930
whatever,
like a comic book convention.

1498
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:12,910
He goes and I twittered as manager and I
asked his manager that he could have,

1499
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:16,070
if I gave them 200 bucks if we could do 
the answering machine.

1500
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:18,180
You wanted to make one,
like the one joe he has for me.

1501
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:18,710
He loves it.

1502
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:22,400
You want to have a to do his.
So the manager,

1503
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:23,180
you know,
they need money,

1504
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:27,600
the magicals come on down or you know,
we're at this hotel and I go,

1505
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,610
oh shit,
he goes,

1506
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:29,940
you want to roll?
I go fuck out.

1507
01:17:29,941 --> 01:17:32,330
So he jumped in,
went to the hotel,

1508
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:36,290
but there were waiting outside and like 
Danny was fuck,

1509
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,690
it looks like they're in a big hurry 
because he was texting him,

1510
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:40,460
hurry up or you guys that we got to go 
to the airport,

1511
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:42,750
this clock,
I want you to give them 200 bucks to sit

1512
01:17:42,751 --> 01:17:44,120
and rap with them.
We get a lot of shit,

1513
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,310
you know,
so um,

1514
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,540
so fuck it,
whatever.

1515
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:49,880
So let's do it really quick.
So he pulls into this hotel.

1516
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,660
I don't like rude.
He's like,

1517
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,020
oh,
we gotta go to the airport and just make

1518
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:55,510
this quick.
It's like this quick like,

1519
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,420
Oh man,
okay.

1520
01:17:56,421 --> 01:18:01,421
Whatever it is,
unless you want to take her to the 

1521
01:18:01,421 --> 01:18:01,421
airport,
we're driving to the airport.

1522
01:18:01,421 --> 01:18:01,421
And you were like,
yeah,

1523
01:18:01,421 --> 01:18:05,501
yeah.
That way we get them for fucking 40 

1524
01:18:05,501 --> 01:18:07,420
minutes man.
So he got the car video do,

1525
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:12,790
we had this fun little restaurant.
Usually it's like 45 minutes of six.

1526
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,400
Just take the whole 45 minutes.
Let's put online in one chunk.

1527
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:17,960
Yeah,
definitely a documentary.

1528
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:26,390
There's certain pieces that need to be 
to make them funnier because we.

1529
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:31,490
We didn't rely on it because he gets 
paid.

1530
01:18:31,491 --> 01:18:35,180
He's like a like a super villain,
almost 70 and you just say,

1531
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:36,950
okay.
Say and his managers,

1532
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:39,680
his nephew,
let's say he barely speaks English,

1533
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:42,090
is English in 10th grade and was in like
a gang.

1534
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:47,110
He knows all these west West westworld 
and fuck him.

1535
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,740
And then his manager goes,
yeah,

1536
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:53,890
a Britain down,
set them up and then take them home and 

1537
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:54,950
it's like these code words.
It's on the or the video,

1538
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:59,980
I forget what it is,
slam and take them home and then glaze 

1539
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:00,800
them at the end or some weird lingo.
So then he goes,

1540
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,270
oh hey,
don't really fucked up.

1541
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:07,250
Fucked up out of some big moves.
Fuck,

1542
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:11,000
I love this shit called capital club.
So he was made.

1543
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:16,030
He was just say all these names.
They want to cut them off and like send 

1544
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:16,030
these guys the messages like,
Hey,

1545
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:17,060
here's what I heard.
Talking mad shit.

1546
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,080
It's always fuck you in the ass.

1547
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:27,810
He just,
it's like he's got his,

1548
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:30,380
his light.
I give me some money.

1549
01:19:30,381 --> 01:19:31,520
I'll say,
who do you want me to say?

1550
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,100
It's like,
what is this personality like outside of

1551
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:38,790
that?
I'm like a nice guy,

1552
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:41,920
but he's not so he's not like that,
man.

1553
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:44,150
You gotta see you gotTa.
See the clip?

1554
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:49,700
I will put it online.
That's hilarious man.

1555
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:54,380
That's one of those dudes that I would 
love to meet and I was like,

1556
01:19:54,381 --> 01:19:56,990
Holy Shit,
I'm here talking to Hulk Hogan.

1557
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:00,030
When I had to do an interview with him 
and his brother,

1558
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:02,300
you don't get fired up.
And I'm like,

1559
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:08,740
fuck it dude.
She was probably all time number one 

1560
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:12,310
villain ever bigger than I.
She,

1561
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:13,980
she wasn't really a villain.

1562
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:21,210
Villain has sometimes she was fucking 
evil.

1563
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:26,490
He was Iranian nuclear war tax shit.
That was deep.

1564
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,880
That was another bit crazier.
Bill and anytime I can barely walk 

1565
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,040
neglectable it got really badly hurt 
from wrestling.

1566
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:42,030
Fucked chester.
They take the snake Roberts,

1567
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:48,021
he said,
I want to get dirt talking about whole 

1568
01:20:48,021 --> 01:20:48,021
Hogan.
He's,

1569
01:20:48,021 --> 01:20:49,380
Oh man,
he's up.

1570
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:55,450
He's a man.
Those kinds of to get operated on,

1571
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:03,670
so such a tough life to do that.
Every night what they're doing is nutty 

1572
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:04,260
shit,
man.

1573
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,500
Flying out of turn,
but he shot and he talks about.

1574
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,410
He just does.
What is it?

1575
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:20,670
He knows this guy who said things that 
weren't very nice,

1576
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:28,551
but anyhow.
What is it in her purse or teeth in the 

1577
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:29,370
morning?
No,

1578
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:34,400
like his.
He started to interview like they asked 

1579
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:34,400
him,
some guys interviewing him and then he's

1580
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,231
says Jujitsu legend and some guy's 
interviewing them and says the video 

1581
01:21:39,651 --> 01:21:44,651
starts on Eddie Bravo section and draco 
Leno on the Geek on world champions 

1582
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:50,510
wheat on training and then they got the 
Eddie Robinson champion.

1583
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:54,360
Jeff.
I guess that's what I always heard about

1584
01:21:54,361 --> 01:21:55,070
him.
I always knew about him.

1585
01:21:55,071 --> 01:21:57,090
I never knew what he looked like until I
saw the video.

1586
01:21:57,091 --> 01:21:58,070
I never,
I would've never,

1587
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:01,950
but especially one of the very highly 
regarded one of the best guys.

1588
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:03,810
That Baja racing,
older guy now products.

1589
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:07,200
That would be something,
and the video starts off by who knows,

1590
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:12,230
what about,
what do you think of Eddie Bravo and 

1591
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:13,600
then it was dr you're talking about 
Eddie Bravo,

1592
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,650
Johnny glow,
like he's just like,

1593
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:19,140
oh yeah,
you really thought he said Johnny Bravo.

1594
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,000
Like,
like that's even funny,

1595
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,440
you know?
And then immediately it starts off with 

1596
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,030
just a bunch of backhanded compliments.
Like,

1597
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,000
like,
uh,

1598
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,130
oh yeah,
he's got some good positions,

1599
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:32,490
but you know,
me and already had a high guard.

1600
01:22:32,491 --> 01:22:37,491
Like he was like basically saying that 
Nino had my style of guard first when me

1601
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:41,280
and Nina filed.
Guards are totally different.

1602
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,960
They're nothing there.
Nothing there.

1603
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:47,880
You're very difficult to often.
I mean we both play,

1604
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:52,960
you know,
we do own a blocks and stuff and I got 

1605
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,741
the job a blocker for him,
but the actual style of our guards are 

1606
01:22:54,741 --> 01:22:54,741
very different.
And uh,

1607
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:57,030
obviously he doesn't know that,
you know,

1608
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:02,150
he doesn't,
he hasn't really paid attention but 

1609
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:02,150
enough to know the difference.
Big fucking difference.

1610
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,380
Um,
and then it says other stuff like,

1611
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,390
uh,

1612
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,410
it's just a bunch of backhanded 
compliments.

1613
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:12,070
It wasn't very,
but I thought it was hilarious.

1614
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:12,910
And so,
uh,

1615
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,070
so she knew about that.
Huh?

1616
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,730
So the sheep knew about that?
Oh,

1617
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:17,790
I don't know.
I don't know.

1618
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,550
He said a lot of good things about me.
Thanks man.

1619
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:24,280
Shit about me.

1620
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,070
Yeah,
he likes me.

1621
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:29,470
I really can't say anything bad about 
the recording.

1622
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,470
I mean,
I don't even fucking know.

1623
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,220
Well,
you know what,

1624
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:32,940
man,
I think,

1625
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:37,941
uh,
there's a lot of people that don't know 

1626
01:23:37,941 --> 01:23:39,981
you and you have a polarizing effect 
because you're so controversial because,

1627
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:42,540
uh,
just the way you look,

1628
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:43,950
the way you act,
you know,

1629
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,350
your behavior is very controversial.
You know,

1630
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:49,440
what you think about,
like most Jujitsu people,

1631
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:54,441
Jujitsu instructors,
they're not like wild musician 

1632
01:23:54,441 --> 01:23:57,810
motherfuckers,
you know that or come up with Jujitsu 

1633
01:23:57,810 --> 01:23:58,770
moves because they're high on weed like 
that.

1634
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:03,830
That fucks up with their whole dynamic.
Their whole view of what you know Jitsu 

1635
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:04,730
is.
And so if they,

1636
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,800
because a lot of dudes don't know you,
I think that's where the controversy 

1637
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,320
comes in,
but they got to know.

1638
01:24:10,321 --> 01:24:15,321
You then realize that you're just sort 
of completely openminded dude who's 

1639
01:24:15,321 --> 01:24:17,190
willing to accept techniques from 
anywhere and gives people credit all the

1640
01:24:17,191 --> 01:24:21,960
time and you invent moves or you teach 
moves based on people's names,

1641
01:24:21,961 --> 01:24:26,961
you know,
like the doodle or did you know 

1642
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:27,840
different types of needs that you've got
the Jacques sweep that you got from each

1643
01:24:27,841 --> 01:24:28,300
individual.

1644
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,390
You give them all credit.
They just don't.

1645
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,560
They don't know.
They,

1646
01:24:31,561 --> 01:24:34,050
they see you getting all this credit for
this revolution,

1647
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:37,020
revolutionary type of guard and so they 
just assumed that it's all bullshit.

1648
01:24:37,021 --> 01:24:39,380
It's all over hyped,
but really it's not.

1649
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:42,360
It's not on time.
Do you got some weird wild shit.

1650
01:24:42,361 --> 01:24:44,790
You put it together in like a real 
system,

1651
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:45,780
you know,
and it's.

1652
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:50,781
And it's very legit and it's very 
unusual and you're willing to talk to 

1653
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:52,800
anybody and have them fuck with it and 
come up with their own stuff.

1654
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:57,801
When you look at all the different 
things that you've added from your 

1655
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:57,930
students,
look at all the moves for Edwin stuff.

1656
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:03,050
You know all,
you know how you started incorporating 

1657
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:03,050
that in a class.
You know,

1658
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:03,850
all sorts of different shifts.
The Japanese in that time,

1659
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:05,160
so you're always,
you know,

1660
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:10,400
adding whenever there's a new thing,
you're always adding it and always 

1661
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:10,760
giving the person credit created who 
created.

1662
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,300
That's one thing.
That's probably the one thing that,

1663
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:19,690
that uh,
the biggest misconception is that you 

1664
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:20,740
take credit for things.
Yeah.

1665
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:25,970
Is it?
I take moves and I changed the names and

1666
01:25:26,151 --> 01:25:29,800
then I pretend like I made them up and I
put a whole new name.

1667
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:35,020
Like there's a lot of people out there 
that think back and that's kind of true 

1668
01:25:35,271 --> 01:25:38,540
or not really sort of 50.
It's totally the opposite.

1669
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,860
It's the opposite.
I everybody fucking up.

1670
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,280
Well,
like the twister,

1671
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,000
you know,
when you first started doing the twister

1672
01:25:44,001 --> 01:25:45,040
and inside wrestling with.

1673
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:46,060
Yeah,
that's a big.

1674
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:48,670
That was the big thing because I never 
called it the twister I got.

1675
01:25:48,671 --> 01:25:53,260
It was the of is guilty to me,
but the guillotines and John Job,

1676
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:58,380
it was,
the good team was already taken and 

1677
01:25:58,380 --> 01:25:58,380
Jujitsu and submission,
grappling,

1678
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:00,630
all that shit.
So when I would call the good see now in

1679
01:26:00,631 --> 01:26:03,020
Brazil and just called it the twister 
and stuck after a.

1680
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:04,200
So a lot of people

1681
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:09,200
think like,
Russell's Goldman did that in high 

1682
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:09,200
school,
man.

1683
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:09,200
I'm like,
yeah,

1684
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,030
you got to know the story.
So real quick,

1685
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:14,420
it's easy to convince those guys if they
ask about me like,

1686
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:16,180
what's up with this twitter thing?
Uh,

1687
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:17,710
you know,
that's a guillotine.

1688
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,250
And wrestling they go,
yeah,

1689
01:26:19,251 --> 01:26:24,251
yeah,
he's got a bunch of groups like that 

1690
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:25,661
dude.
He just changes names and then real 

1691
01:26:25,661 --> 01:26:27,551
quick now I got to dig myself out of a 
deep hole with a lot of people like 

1692
01:26:27,551 --> 01:26:32,141
that.
That's like a total opposite 

1693
01:26:32,141 --> 01:26:32,141
misconception that I like take moons and
steal them.

1694
01:26:32,141 --> 01:26:32,290
And,
and that's,

1695
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:37,300
I like,
I did it for awhile and then I had to 

1696
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:37,700
stop and slow down and change my ways.
And from day one,

1697
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:42,940
my first book I give everyone credit my 
Silverado do all that shit.

1698
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,600
I've,
I get pissed off when people learn 

1699
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,510
techniques from someone else and I know 
them personally.

1700
01:26:50,511 --> 01:26:55,511
I know where they got the move from and 
then they start showing it to someone 

1701
01:26:55,511 --> 01:26:55,511
and that'll bring up the person that 
taught them.

1702
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,520
That offends me.
I don't always remember to bring up 

1703
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,340
names,
but I tried to as much as I can.

1704
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:06,740
Jujitsu moves as like a creative thing 
that you're adding to like one big 

1705
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:09,120
gigantic piece of artwork,
like the martial art itself,

1706
01:27:09,121 --> 01:27:11,010
like when you,
when you invented a new technique,

1707
01:27:11,011 --> 01:27:16,011
like you invent some new sweep or some 
new way to set up a Google plateau and 

1708
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:18,530
then you add it to the Jujitsu language.
Do you feel like that's what it is?

1709
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:20,970
It's almost like you feel like it's like
a piece of art,

1710
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:26,090
so it was something that you create and 
people don't give you credit for 

1711
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:26,370
creating that and then people were out 
there doing it.

1712
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:31,371
It's like they're stealing your art 
almost because they're going to do it 

1713
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,520
regardless what they want.
So that's the thing.

1714
01:27:32,521 --> 01:27:36,440
Anybody who was doing his shit,
he supports and he even had a cop,

1715
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:37,150
you know,
like you,

1716
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:38,940
you'd love that guy out there doing your
shit.

1717
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,460
Yeah,
totally.

1718
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,610
I mean I'm human.
I want,

1719
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:48,790
you know,
if someone learns some ship directly 

1720
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:48,790
from me or my books or anything,
you know,

1721
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:51,290
the right thing to do is get credit,
you know,

1722
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:55,590
that's the right thing to do and not 
giving credit is you did it,

1723
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,600
you know,
whoever you learn a technique from the 

1724
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:00,600
crowd,
you've got to,

1725
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,280
if you don't go into a strap on,
it doesn't take away from what you did 

1726
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:04,280
at all.
You know,

1727
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,770
people think that somehow or another you
teach them a guy,

1728
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:08,870
you know,
a certain way to set up a rear naked and

1729
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:10,970
then he does it and then you give them 
credit.

1730
01:28:10,971 --> 01:28:12,110
It takes away from him.
No,

1731
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:14,370
it doesn't take away from that at all.
Not at all.

1732
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:17,800
It's just the friendly thing to do.
And he sounded like daytime,

1733
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:22,300
like I pull off a submission,
a that someone else in class showed me.

1734
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:24,590
I'll always go from go it,
got it twice a day,

1735
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:28,820
you know what I mean?
Do the same thing or the same thing.

1736
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:30,830
Yeah,
that's important man.

1737
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:32,150
It's,
it's important and it's,

1738
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:32,540
it,
uh,

1739
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:34,950
fosters that friendly attitude to come 
out.

1740
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:38,780
All I'm trying to do,
I mean I guess it feels good.

1741
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:42,350
It's like a piece of art and something.
I always feel good when a new transition

1742
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:47,351
comes up out of nowhere or someone else 
and one of my students to me or we see 

1743
01:28:47,351 --> 01:28:47,990
it on the Internet.
I get excited.

1744
01:28:47,991 --> 01:28:48,810
It's cool.
It's like another.

1745
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:49,730
Those beans I'll do

1746
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,500
it.
Have no idea how complex it is.

1747
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:56,501
They really have no idea how many levels
and layers there say like I was talking 

1748
01:28:56,501 --> 01:28:57,790
to Nathan,
we were talking about,

1749
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,740
hey,
he trained with Marcello and I went down

1750
01:29:00,741 --> 01:29:05,741
to New York of training them a couple of
times and it was just talking about how 

1751
01:29:05,741 --> 01:29:08,421
good marcella moves and how it's really 
amazing to see someone operate on that 

1752
01:29:08,421 --> 01:29:08,760
level and we just started thinking about
it,

1753
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:13,761
like how humbling that is.
Like when you're around a guy like 

1754
01:29:13,761 --> 01:29:13,761
Marcello or operator or something like 
that.

1755
01:29:13,761 --> 01:29:14,640
Video.
Wait Online,

1756
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:19,641
rolling through.
People just rolling through one after 

1757
01:29:19,641 --> 01:29:19,641
another.
Just submitting a left,

1758
01:29:19,641 --> 01:29:19,641
right,
left,

1759
01:29:19,641 --> 01:29:19,641
right,
left,

1760
01:29:19,641 --> 01:29:20,200
right.
When,

1761
01:29:20,201 --> 01:29:22,110
when you see someone who's at that high 
level,

1762
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,260
you know,
it's like,

1763
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:27,420
it's so humbling because you realize how
many gundam layers there are to this.

1764
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:31,950
It never ends.
It's a more complex and more,

1765
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:33,300
you know,
the guy shoots a pet,

1766
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:38,400
gets faster and they're diving on shit 
with more precision and their technique 

1767
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,690
is more crisp and more sharp and more 
options and

1768
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:46,710
there's 12 different ways that I can 
count and they're maybe more 12 to toys 

1769
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:49,390
to play off your back.
Then that's what I can count.

1770
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:54,660
Well distinctly different styles.
Like there's a difference you can tell 

1771
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,940
to the train die.
So look at Tom.

1772
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:58,530
He's playing deep path.
He's ex card,

1773
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:01,700
he's playing a lockdown.
Hap,

1774
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:06,870
he's playing 50 slash 50 guard.
He's planning a butterfly gardens and 

1775
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:10,240
Robert Gard,
there's 12 of them that I could count.

1776
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:13,480
There might be more of a Deli,
Heba Guard,

1777
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,190
spiral card,
all that shit.

1778
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:20,520
There's so many.
It's so complex.

1779
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:22,750
I mean,
I've been doing Jujitsu for 16 years.

1780
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:27,220
I suck at most of those gardens.
Like I'm not that good at.

1781
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,980
I might have been della Heba Guard 
doesn't exist there,

1782
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:32,470
so that's a whole different stock spiral
guard,

1783
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,900
inverted guard.
I never do any of that stuff.

1784
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:37,180
I never played 50 slash 50 guard.

1785
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:42,360
I never did any of that shit.
I mean I have like four or five guards 

1786
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:45,100
and there's like 12.
There's a lot of them that I don't do.

1787
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:50,280
There's so much like all these world 
champions like Rafael Mendez and marina 

1788
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,470
and all these guys.
This is totally different than mine.

1789
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:57,540
Totally.
Like if we've taught for our seminars 

1790
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:57,540
eats,
I mean two different worlds,

1791
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:01,820
you know what I mean?
There's so much to learn which path 

1792
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:01,820
you're going to take.
You know what I mean?

1793
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:06,810
I've been doing like again 16 years and 
I'm still putting new weapons into the 

1794
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:07,750
game.
That's.

1795
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:11,470
I make sure that there's always new 
projects that are always,

1796
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:16,530
always,
always got to be a new projects and 

1797
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,310
those projects could take one to three 
years to get where you need them to be.

1798
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:21,070
The Doris is still my project from like,
you know,

1799
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:22,690
five years ago,
you know,

1800
01:31:22,691 --> 01:31:24,510
I'm not as good as the top guys with.

1801
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:26,980
Does a pretty good and I'm not,
I'm not as good as,

1802
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:28,750
I still got some more levels to pop 
through,

1803
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:34,110
but you know the over the last year,
year and a half via teens and north 

1804
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:36,880
south suck with those,
but they've been on my project.

1805
01:31:36,881 --> 01:31:41,881
That's when I go against the scrubs.
When I go against the white belts and 

1806
01:31:41,881 --> 01:31:41,881
new guys,
you know,

1807
01:31:41,881 --> 01:31:42,020
I'm not going to do anything that I'm 
good.

1808
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:46,960
I'm going to only get shit that I suck 
at and try to train my body.

1809
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:49,690
I would get into north south and I go,
this feels awkward.

1810
01:31:49,691 --> 01:31:51,770
I don't know how Danny does it,
you know,

1811
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:56,780
and,
but I would get in there and try to get 

1812
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:56,780
as far as I can and I'd lose it.
I'd go do something else.

1813
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:58,220
That's cool.
I'll come back to it and try it again.

1814
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,670
We're not stopping.
I'm not really pleasing.

1815
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:05,670
Right.
Trying to move my lucky focus on it and 

1816
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:07,140
after awhile then you get into like,
oh,

1817
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,620
okay,
this is feeling good.

1818
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,210
I think,
you know,

1819
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:12,820
eventually it'll come and you have to 
remember that people forget that because

1820
01:32:12,821 --> 01:32:14,530
a lot of people when they try something 
new they go,

1821
01:32:14,531 --> 01:32:15,670
well,
it feels kind of awkward.

1822
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:16,180
Fuck that.
I'm gonna.

1823
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:17,440
Go back to my shit.
I don't know.

1824
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:19,410
He's weird.
He's got some strange too big.

1825
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:23,110
You got to remember that all moves.
Feel awkward in the beginning and if you

1826
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:24,550
want this movement,
doesn't matter.

1827
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:27,670
You can master listening if you want it,
you can be a carrier with this.

1828
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,070
It's up to you how many reps who are 
willing to put in,

1829
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,830
you know,
and in Jujitsu,

1830
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:38,480
you know,
the only sport where you can spar 100 

1831
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:38,700
percent every day.
Everyone just sparse there.

1832
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:42,640
Like maybe they'd put in as few reps as 
possible.

1833
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,220
Most people have that mentality back 
unless you force them.

1834
01:32:45,221 --> 01:32:50,221
And that's what I do.
I force my guys because I know they're 

1835
01:32:50,221 --> 01:32:50,221
going to get lazy and a guy said,
okay,

1836
01:32:50,221 --> 01:32:52,540
everyone do 15 those,
20 of that and make sure to do that.

1837
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:56,410
And like I write it on a board and I 
just kicked back and you know,

1838
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,270
chill.
They're not going to do it.

1839
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:02,440
You gotta have people need people.
That's why they hire trainers.

1840
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,900
They can do everything.
They know all the exercises.

1841
01:33:04,901 --> 01:33:09,901
They know they can be.
They just need some of the foursome and 

1842
01:33:09,901 --> 01:33:09,901
got someone to force you and you're 
paying them.

1843
01:33:09,901 --> 01:33:11,060
Then it's easier to go to that shit.

1844
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,450
Never do to actually get to try it.

1845
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,780
For me,
I just look at everything.

1846
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:20,150
Most things because like longterm 
projects,

1847
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:25,151
like what?
How many cycles have you gone through 

1848
01:33:25,151 --> 01:33:26,240
with this technique and eventually by 
third or fourth cycle,

1849
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:31,330
once you hit it bad left,
now he's doing really well and look at 

1850
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:31,330
them.

1851
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:34,960
Yeah.
It's hard to motivate yourself to push 

1852
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:34,960
yourself.
It is definitely important.

1853
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,330
And pushing.
Rolling.

1854
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,430
Uh,
so much more fun.

1855
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:37,690
Drills.
Yeah.

1856
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:42,720
Actually.
Can you imagine getting on a video game 

1857
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,071
and do you ever get on the practice?
Just practice the little movements over 

1858
01:33:46,221 --> 01:33:47,420
and over,
like 50 times.

1859
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:48,410
Like,
okay this.

1860
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:51,980
Do people do that?
Like a room where they can just practice

1861
01:33:51,981 --> 01:33:56,981
movements and now they're getting really
good with all the moves and they do all 

1862
01:33:56,981 --> 01:33:56,981
the techniques

1863
01:33:56,981 --> 01:34:00,970
that it's like a workout they do.
Wake up is based on map.

1864
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:06,260
It's based on map systems.
So there's a bunch of different maps to 

1865
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:09,241
play on.
But one of the most important things 

1866
01:34:09,241 --> 01:34:09,450
about playing quick when you're in a one
on one tool is to understand the map.

1867
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:11,450
You're got to know where the guns are 
out there hitting.

1868
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:13,890
You got to know where you're going to 
control the map.

1869
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:16,710
So what you've gotta do is you've gotta 
make sure you're not every fucking,

1870
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,470
every minute area and you can move 
around.

1871
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:23,250
So they practice their practice like 
special jumps and rocket jobs.

1872
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,840
Practice jumping into certain areas and 
so they don't get to have a really far 

1873
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:33,321
and then crumble.
So they'll practice that shape their 

1874
01:34:33,321 --> 01:34:35,780
practices so they have complete command 
of the map so they can move around the 

1875
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:37,260
map anywhere they want.
And then they practice timing.

1876
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:38,340
When the,
uh,

1877
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:43,380
the new version,
because you were playing the best person

1878
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:46,600
though is quite free to me.
Quite force,

1879
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:49,100
pretty bad ass.
That's the latest I think,

1880
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,940
quick for us to last because it takes 
years to make,

1881
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:53,720
you know,
everyone they didn't know.

1882
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:56,910
They came up with a new tool every year 
when they get better and better.

1883
01:34:56,911 --> 01:34:58,190
I know.
Anything about video games

1884
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:03,110
does this,
like the graphics and the amount of area

1885
01:35:03,111 --> 01:35:07,210
you can travel to always bigger getting 
bigger and bigger.

1886
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:13,050
Massive with orange juice or something 
like that.

1887
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,960
Role player games,
massive world.

1888
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:20,990
It's like an artificial world again 
where you can just travel for miles and 

1889
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:24,690
meet new people and show people,
live their whole lives inside those 

1890
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:24,690
things

1891
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:27,930
and they're actually real people and 
they're the real people.

1892
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:33,430
Real people playing.
The people have lost their mind when it 

1893
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:33,840
comes to these things.
I never even heard of that.

1894
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:38,870
People Starve people.
There's two people in Korea but their 

1895
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:38,870
baby starve

1896
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:43,650
while they are nourishing their online.
Maybe they have fake baby online and 

1897
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:45,760
they were taking care of that baby while
they're real baby starve to death.

1898
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:49,210
And Dean Boston marbles.
That's crazy.

1899
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,360
People are living in artificial worlds 
eight,

1900
01:35:52,361 --> 01:35:54,500
10 hours a day and addicted to it.
What's it called?

1901
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:57,690
There's a bunch of world of warcraft.
There's a,

1902
01:35:57,790 --> 01:36:00,360
there's a everquest.
There's a.

1903
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,130
what's the other one?
The sims.

1904
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:05,180
There's um,
uh,

1905
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,280
there's another one.
Something line.

1906
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:11,040
There's no,
no,

1907
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:11,980
no.
That's the,

1908
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:15,120
that's the cool with the advantage.
So efficient one.

1909
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:18,560
How many people on second life maybe was
called second life for a second.

1910
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,580
Do there's 13,000.
Two hundred and 10 people.

1911
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:25,060
No,
no,

1912
01:36:25,061 --> 01:36:25,780
no.
Look above.

1913
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:30,990
People are dropping off.
They're like,

1914
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:36,360
what the fuck am I watching?
Watching three retards stoned out of 

1915
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,070
their minds.
And I've talk to a camera.

1916
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:38,490
Thirty thousand,
200,

1917
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:42,930
10.
All this shit isn't boring.

1918
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:46,480
It's the 4:20
episode.

1919
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,510
If they're all with us or with us.

1920
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:51,820
I passed out on park today.
Well,

1921
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:55,900
I've been close like two or three times 
a month or two in a real life is like,

1922
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:01,020
oh my God.
And then I imagine that jumps in the 

1923
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:01,020
bed.
I think on the floor.

1924
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:01,820
The top of my head.
How much weed?

1925
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,910
Not that much,

1926
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:08,700
dude.
Not that much and it happened to his 

1927
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:09,850
girlfriend I had once and it was like 
she had like one kid.

1928
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
It wasn't anything major.
Just what I saw someone do that we gave 

1929
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:20,531
the.
That chick was working on fear factor 

1930
01:37:20,531 --> 01:37:20,531
and that was one of the production 
people.

1931
01:37:20,531 --> 01:37:21,880
We're all,
we're all in New York or outside of.

1932
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:25,660
We all went out there filming there for 
the weekend instead of Bar,

1933
01:37:25,661 --> 01:37:27,200
have a drink,
get as much smoke,

1934
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:32,680
someone to never smoked to joining the 
ship.

1935
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:37,720
One big hips train wreck and her eyes 
rolled back in her head and she was 

1936
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:38,820
dropped.
I thought she was faking,

1937
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:42,500
pretending like I was part,
so I'm so I'm going to pass out.

1938
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:43,610
I thought she,
she's being silly,

1939
01:37:43,611 --> 01:37:46,250
like we got to catch her up as she was 
falling down to the ground.

1940
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:50,510
The girlfriend was like that and I was 
like,

1941
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:55,511
what are you doing?
And I understand that she was going 

1942
01:37:55,511 --> 01:37:55,511
down.

1943
01:37:55,511 --> 01:37:55,511
Did you catch him?
Nope.

1944
01:37:55,511 --> 01:37:56,040
Did you make

1945
01:37:56,060 --> 01:38:01,060
an effort,
an effort scheduled popcorn so that the 

1946
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:07,940
fucking check drop.
So you didn't have to drop your popcorn 

1947
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:08,010
and probably wasn't gonna be able to 
catch her anyway.

1948
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:13,380
What you need to get a chance.
I didn't understand what was really 

1949
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,030
happening,
but it happened to me yesterday.

1950
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:16,960
How many,
how long have you been?

1951
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:20,230
Data's checked a few months.
Oh,

1952
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,240
attached were you to her.
Right.

1953
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:25,930
So we bummed out when she bumped her 
out,

1954
01:38:25,931 --> 01:38:26,610
she felt.
Yeah,

1955
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:29,370
I didn't quite get it until she was 
fully down and paint.

1956
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:32,210
Because you feel about responsible.
Somebody else.

1957
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:37,350
It gave us Wednesday.
Zombieland did you watch this season of 

1958
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:42,110
celebrity rehab?
I watched one episode that check from 

1959
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:50,080
one day at a time.
Mackenzie Phillips rooming with this 

1960
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:55,580
country x country center.
You as epileptic seizures and she would 

1961
01:38:56,810 --> 01:39:01,810
always like in the middle of this 
conversation she was just telling 

1962
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:01,810
Mckenzie

1963
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:08,150
she's breaking breezy.
It's not required that mother Charles 

1964
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,650
after the commercial.

1965
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:24,810
Oh my God.
Have you guys seen shreds?

1966
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:30,360
Shreds shreds is a thing you guys are 
doing.

1967
01:39:30,361 --> 01:39:35,361
They're taking music videos and redoing 
the music like I just saw from Germany.

1968
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,780
They redo the music set as lipstick and 
totally as perfect as possible.

1969
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:41,500
But the worst voices,

1970
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:44,210
everything's attitude and everything 
inside the cabinet.

1971
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:46,750
So you see this.
It's like the worst brought.

1972
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:51,060
Yeah.

1973
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:56,210
Jerry,
like they suck.

1974
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:04,770
Let's watch it and we'll.
Anyway.

1975
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:06,720
You want to journey.
It's funny.

1976
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,760
They did one on Mac dance,
a dance at the center and he's friends 

1977
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:18,140
with this guy now and he said when he 
showed it to him too,

1978
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:23,150
he got really offended at the journeys 
and journeys.

1979
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:24,540
I,
you know,

1980
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:26,610
they're like amazing musicians and 
singers.

1981
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:28,530
Okay.
I looked up shreds.

1982
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:30,630
Journey treads,
wet shreds.

1983
01:40:30,631 --> 01:40:31,290
Journey.
That's it.

1984
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:36,740
Any way you want to eat or ed.
I think if we're going to be within the 

1985
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:42,480
journey,
just a junky shreds.

1986
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:43,230
That's it.
That's it.

1987
01:40:43,231 --> 01:40:45,210
That's at the top.
And you make it to the audience.

1988
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:49,270
Watch junkie shred.
You guys going to have to look up junkie

1989
01:40:49,271 --> 01:40:50,010
shreds

1990
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:54,200
junkie.

1991
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:59,550
Jerk knee.
Jerk jerk commercial journey.

1992
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:01,770
Like journey.
Oh,

1993
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:05,820
journey down.
I didn't get it either.

1994
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:11,100
Sure.
It's genius.

1995
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:44,640
That's very funny.
That's good.

1996
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:48,000
Shit.
You guys to watch it.

1997
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:53,090
I just sent it to a twitter already.
Can do that.

1998
01:42:56,131 --> 01:42:58,650
So easy.
It's so easy to do stuff like that.

1999
01:42:58,651 --> 01:43:03,630
Now to edit video and put it online,
like it'd be nice to be hard to actually

2000
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,330
listen to the song on earphones record 
here.

2001
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:09,060
Right along with them as they're doing 
it.

2002
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:11,160
Yeah.
What'd you can do now?

2003
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,710
A lot of people have already seen it.
Go look up van Halen

2004
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:17,710
or,
or,

2005
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:19,300
um,
different.

2006
01:43:19,301 --> 01:43:19,600
Different.

2007
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:26,330
That was some funny shit.
Yeah.

2008
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,220
It was funny.
I try to read some of those.

2009
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:35,600
We might be too high and we're doing 
this.

2010
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:39,940
Should,
should be illegal.

2011
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:41,900
Ari,
that bladder?

2012
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:42,760
No,

2013
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:45,790
that was loud.
Yeah,

2014
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,840
sorry.
Well that recovered it and they do that 

2015
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:51,660
the best way.
Kids threads.

2016
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:54,130
I heard you were publishing it.

2017
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,090
Scientific paper in neuroscience.
That's hilarious.

2018
01:43:57,930 --> 01:44:00,700
If that wasn't true,
I would be a Carlson.

2019
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:01,650
Been seeing it.

2020
01:44:04,990 --> 01:44:07,960
Somebody wrote some shit in the Arabic.
Arabic does the cool.

2021
01:44:07,961 --> 01:44:11,230
Doesn't it look cool?
That shit looks Arabic.

2022
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:13,680
Yeah.
That's probably the coolest second.

2023
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:18,730
Writing on the plan.
Probably Cooler than Chinese or 

2024
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:22,381
Japanese.
It looks like something elegant to it,

2025
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:28,490
you know,
it's like cool to see it on your wall.

2026
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:30,350
You know,
it was like art.

2027
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:36,580
So this chick wants to fuck you.
Do SLURP,

2028
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,650
Bella?
She's back.

2029
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:39,720
Oh Shit.
She says,

2030
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:43,590
explain the name name's Bella.
Where'd you get that from?

2031
01:44:43,591 --> 01:44:46,090
Who gave it to you?
Did you doubt yourself?

2032
01:44:46,810 --> 01:44:47,530
People in here,
man.

2033
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:51,720
There's no way are we gonna have to keep
an eye on it to catch her response.

2034
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:54,760
Can I get Dave Chappelle on here 
sometime?

2035
01:44:54,761 --> 01:44:56,140
I would love to hang out with Dave 
Chappelle,

2036
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:01,320
but I don't know him that well.
We did a show a couple of times and one 

2037
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:05,371
time it's just because I was walking on 
the street and random and other times 

2038
01:45:05,371 --> 01:45:06,760
the fear factor one,
the one we ran into was hilarious.

2039
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:09,130
Remember that you would have been in New
York.

2040
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:10,930
We're just walking on the street and I'm
like,

2041
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:15,970
oh,
like dish called a mustache on things 

2042
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:15,970
like,
hey joe,

2043
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:17,080
you want to be in my show?
Was like,

2044
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,620
okay,
and was that a nowhere?

2045
01:45:18,621 --> 01:45:20,350
No,
it's Times Square.

2046
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:24,710
Just walking down the street.
That was what a Dave Chappelle show,

2047
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:29,750
you know,
like nobody had any idea it was even 

2048
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,811
coming out.
And then when it came out like right 

2049
01:45:31,811 --> 01:45:31,811
away.
Well that was the best show ever.

2050
01:45:31,811 --> 01:45:34,340
But the first case,
I'm sure it was like,

2051
01:45:34,341 --> 01:45:34,570
no,
no,

2052
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,300
no,
let's leave it.

2053
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:38,300
That one knocked it out of the park.
That was the best shot with that.

2054
01:45:38,301 --> 01:45:40,340
The first sketch ever.
And so I don't know.

2055
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:45,830
I know it's the first sketch on the top 
25 because I think when he said it,

2056
01:45:45,831 --> 01:45:48,830
I think I remember it going like we lose
my friends said I shouldn't do this.

2057
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:52,220
It almost seemed like he had introduced 
to other scriptures already,

2058
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:55,070
but just for the audience knows the 
answer to this.

2059
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:57,440
But that's a good question.
That seems like intelligence.

2060
01:45:57,470 --> 01:46:00,810
The audience here.
We could find out anything about that.

2061
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:02,950
How about when we couldn't remember that
dude's name earlier?

2062
01:46:02,951 --> 01:46:05,790
Dennis hopper just knocked up.
Yeah.

2063
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,530
That's incredible.
Yeah,

2064
01:46:08,531 --> 01:46:11,230
I mean there's,
there's a 1600,

2065
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:12,190
66.
One,

2066
01:46:12,191 --> 01:46:12,670
six,
six,

2067
01:46:12,671 --> 01:46:13,690
six.
We're evil.

2068
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,040
We're officially

2069
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:18,640
do got a lot of viewers.

2070
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:23,210
Right.
And some other shiny happy Jihad.

2071
01:46:23,211 --> 01:46:28,211
Listen man,
don't be mixing my shit up with that 

2072
01:46:28,211 --> 01:46:29,090
shit because I don't know what you're 
saying about the chicken,

2073
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:34,091
Nevada that got sent to life in prison 
because she talked to 14 year old boy.

2074
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:40,780
Just wanting to try to get them to have 
sex with her and she grabbed his hand 

2075
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:40,780
and put it on her tit and try to get an 
a fucker.

2076
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:47,310
Got Life in prison.
That is the mandatory sentence for that 

2077
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:48,960
life and business and management.
She's 14,

2078
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:53,990
the kids 14 years old and she's like 34 
some shit and she grabbed the kid's hand

2079
01:46:54,511 --> 01:46:59,511
and put it on her tick and she said she 
was drunk and she doesn't remember any 

2080
01:46:59,511 --> 01:46:59,511
of it and this bitch is going to.

2081
01:46:59,511 --> 01:47:03,110
Oh,
that's possible.

2082
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:06,920
Don't remember who did it.
All she did was put it,

2083
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:12,780
you know,
obviously the bitches crazy and she 

2084
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:14,911
needs to do like a,
a night in jail or maybe a week at the 

2085
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:14,911
most,
you know,

2086
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:18,841
like what would it be like to spend one 
month in prison that will fucking 

2087
01:47:20,141 --> 01:47:21,930
destroy a lot of your life.
Yeah.

2088
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:22,760
And people are like,
oh.

2089
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:25,360
And he's got at least 10 years.
Thinking about what a month,

2090
01:47:25,361 --> 01:47:30,160
year in prison would be horrifying.
Terrible,

2091
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:35,520
terrible.
And for just getting a boy to touch at 

2092
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:35,520
10,
I mean,

2093
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:35,920
yeah you should have done it,
but come on,

2094
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:37,380
you're supposed to like slap on the 
wrist.

2095
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:42,440
Tony Kanal there so that.
So she's not even eligible for parole 

2096
01:47:42,671 --> 01:47:47,671
for 10 years.
She has to go 10 years before she was 

2097
01:47:47,671 --> 01:47:50,581
even eligible.
I'd like to know the details of that 

2098
01:47:50,581 --> 01:47:51,280
shit not been done.

2099
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:56,060
You guys just fucking support held area

2100
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,720
and I'm going to send an unbelievable.
It's hard to believe that people are 

2101
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,990
that stupid.
I would give someone like her that.

2102
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:05,160
I mean that's why it's an interesting 
story.

2103
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:10,161
So when you're in class got thrown out 
and you do like nothing or school but 

2104
01:48:10,161 --> 01:48:11,900
share and it's like,
no you didn't,

2105
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:13,970
you were moving over and told you to 
stop.

2106
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:19,030
That's all well and good.
But that was the charges with the 

2107
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:19,030
charges were,

2108
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:21,210
is um,
lewdness minor or some shit like that.

2109
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:26,460
She's machines for awhile.
Probably wasn't the first time raising 

2110
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:30,140
feed stocks deck on the little kids.
Doesn't stop.

2111
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:34,030
Well,
if she did it to this kitchen,

2112
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:39,120
probably done the other one.
It's not like she's been fucking grown 

2113
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,280
men,
it's just that they're just take time.

2114
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,230
It's not like,
you know,

2115
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,830
like all of a sudden out of nowhere she 
says,

2116
01:48:44,831 --> 01:48:46,450
let me just dive in this 14 year old 
thing.

2117
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:51,480
She's done it before,
so it's just not particular about who 

2118
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:51,480
she blows,
you know,

2119
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:51,610
that's all that is.
She's just a crazy bitch,

2120
01:48:52,570 --> 01:48:55,060
but she didn't have to go to jail for 
the rest of her fucking life.

2121
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:58,760
That's not know.
They're trying to put kids in Jennifer's

2122
01:48:58,761 --> 01:49:03,761
sexting and trying to make it illegal 
for girls to share their same child 

2123
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:11,320
pornographer not notes of course.
Right.

2124
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:16,750
Do what are they doing it to each other 
and childhood setting through their 

2125
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:16,750
boyfriends.

2126
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:19,210
One of your questions store a bunch of 
spend it.

2127
01:49:19,211 --> 01:49:22,840
I think it was like nine girls got 
suspended from school because they had a

2128
01:49:22,841 --> 01:49:27,841
bunch of pictures that they took and put
on their myspace page in between school 

2129
01:49:28,001 --> 01:49:30,340
when they're not at school,
like during the summer break.

2130
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:35,550
So when it came back to school,
there was suspended because of sexy 

2131
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:38,911
pictures of them.
I suppose they're like sucking fingers 

2132
01:49:38,911 --> 01:49:39,610
sticking out and underwear and stuff and
there were like 14.

2133
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:44,080
They're just doing a normal horse shit 
and they got suspended.

2134
01:49:44,081 --> 01:49:47,890
So the girls are suing the school.
They're going to win.

2135
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:53,370
I mean if it can go on my space,
you can't tell someone they can't do 

2136
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:54,460
something during their off time because 
you're not like it,

2137
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,780
but you're just because you're teaching 
them,

2138
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:58,060
you know,
when did the these fucking retards,

2139
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:04,330
whatsapp people access and go to school.
What you could access.

2140
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:06,350
That's cool.
If you had access to my space at school,

2141
01:50:06,351 --> 01:50:08,660
I don't know what kind of Internet 
access to have at school.

2142
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:14,720
Yeah,
but either way the kids should be able 

2143
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:16,721
to put.
Everyone wants to be a war so it'd be a 

2144
01:50:16,721 --> 01:50:16,721
more.
You can't legislate against that and you

2145
01:50:16,721 --> 01:50:19,010
certainly can't punish them for shit to 
do.

2146
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:21,410
You're acting like you're in fucking 
mom.

2147
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:26,530
Like you're.
You're saying you don't want them in 

2148
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:28,331
school because of what they're going to.
It's going to give other people a bad 

2149
01:50:28,331 --> 01:50:28,331
impression of your school.
Is that what it is?

2150
01:50:28,331 --> 01:50:30,950
Because she's in her underwear online.
Like shut the fuck up.

2151
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:33,430
So this is one of these dummies because 
that are,

2152
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,930
that are teaching our kids today and 
that's the problem.

2153
01:50:35,931 --> 01:50:37,850
There's a bunch of.
Were fucking audience,

2154
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:40,310
you know.
When did they become the parents?

2155
01:50:40,311 --> 01:50:41,630
When did they become the,
you know,

2156
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:46,810
the moral arbitrators and what,
when did they become the people that 

2157
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:46,810
dictate now how people are supposed to 
behave.

2158
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:52,100
You know,
if you don't have a problem with your 

2159
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:52,250
kid sticking her ass up in the air and 
space and you're the teacher,

2160
01:50:52,251 --> 01:50:53,150
you should be like,
whatever.

2161
01:50:53,151 --> 01:50:56,300
I'm going to teach you some science and 
you get through life and enjoy yourself,

2162
01:50:56,460 --> 01:51:01,460
but with the teachers will step in and 
say you shouldn't be in your underwear 

2163
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:01,520
when you're mad at school.
Like fuck you.

2164
01:51:02,090 --> 01:51:04,580
Who Do you just teach?
Just teach me.

2165
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:09,860
You don't,
you don't get to fucking shut my life 

2166
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:09,860
down because you know you don't like me 
in my underwear.

2167
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:12,460
Seattle.
I said that.

2168
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,750
I said in the first person I got was a 
14 year old girl,

2169
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:18,320
was a secret fantasy.
He didn't even notice that.

2170
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:20,700
How did they?
14,

2171
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:21,800
14,
14,

2172
01:51:21,801 --> 01:51:22,460
15 years old.

2173
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,710
Do you can't stop checks from doing 
worship?

2174
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,500
They arrested a 15 year old girlfriend 
child.

2175
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:33,810
I'm free because she sent a dude a in 
her class,

2176
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:36,180
a picture of repurposing,
so they arrested her.

2177
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:41,880
They eventually charged her with a use 
of criminal tools in a criminal tool.

2178
01:51:41,881 --> 01:51:45,230
Was a cell phone,
wasn't charged the community.

2179
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:46,470
Is that.
That's incredible.

2180
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:51,730
That's a tiny little facts.
Izzy.

2181
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:55,350
Yeah,
Brian's fucked.

2182
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:58,410
I love you.
I'm also invited.

2183
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:01,260
Oh,
that's so sweet for Brian Wilson here.

2184
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:04,920
Have done.
Brian is Brian Bent into a school and he

2185
01:52:04,921 --> 01:52:07,620
was eating some yogurt and bit down 
first of all,

2186
01:52:07,621 --> 01:52:12,621
signed.
And that's supposed to bite that God 

2187
01:52:12,621 --> 01:52:12,621
damn hard on yogurt.
You Know How hungry is he?

2188
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:15,260
Bit Down into his metal spoon.
Yeah.

2189
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:16,590
What are you doing?
Biting it.

2190
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:19,800
I don't need to go over all the plastics
bullets from now and for you.

2191
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:23,160
So he bit down on us.
Go and focus to waste.

2192
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:28,180
I am.
Scott said he's going to put them in a 

2193
01:52:28,601 --> 01:52:29,960
triangle choke.
How dare you?

2194
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:34,570
I don't like being caught trying.
That's uncomfortable.

2195
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:37,330
Scared.
Scared that you're scared.

2196
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:41,670
Now you really got me scared.
I'll just say he was stoned,

2197
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,780
eating yogurt,
yogurt,

2198
01:52:43,781 --> 01:52:45,530
thinking about yummy ticks.

2199
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:51,530
Just get outside of the clamp down.
I'm thankful.

2200
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:54,200
We talked about all the things I wanted 
to talk about.

2201
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:59,710
I talked about the lady in Nevada.
We talked about strikeforce and they 

2202
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:00,540
have any other comments?
Eddie?

2203
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:03,560
Mike Whitehead got busted for sexual 
assaults.

2204
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:07,630
That's not good for the movement.
My Damn,

2205
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:10,340
that sucks.
I was he drunk too.

2206
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:15,580
I hope it's all bullshit.
Jack Jack Hair Dye and you know,

2207
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,820
he had a massive heart attack a year ago
and is based on.

2208
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:21,650
So they just thought she was dead the 
whole time.

2209
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:23,750
I didn't know who was a person they 
thought he was done.

2210
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:28,760
There was a bunch of people sat like,
I think even doug sent out an RFP with a

2211
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:33,761
lot of people were saying he was dead 
and so there the rumor going around but 

2212
01:53:33,761 --> 01:53:33,761
it wasn't.
He was dead,

2213
01:53:33,761 --> 01:53:35,800
but he was basically like barely.
It is basically the.

2214
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:41,800
Wow.
I don't know the scientists of the 

2215
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:41,800
medical details,
but I know that he was in really,

2216
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:44,450
really bad shape from the time of that 
till till now.

2217
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:45,570
So who was it,
sorry,

2218
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:50,580
it wasn't that he was just really a 
powerful marijuana activists that 

2219
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:55,511
started out his life as like this gold 
water republican type guy who was like 

2220
01:53:55,511 --> 01:53:59,840
really anti elite and then he'd gotten 
divorced and smoking pot with this woman

2221
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:05,080
that he had just met this new woman.
He took a chance and there's a single 

2222
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,830
guy and you know,
hanging out with some chicken and really

2223
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:10,310
kind of was blown away by it and then 
know,

2224
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:15,520
fell in love with the effects of 
marijuana and instead of looking into 

2225
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,641
the history and then he put up this 
really fucking amazing book called the 

2226
01:54:18,641 --> 01:54:22,421
emperor wears no clothes and it's all 
about this marijuana already been 

2227
01:54:22,421 --> 01:54:22,580
general.
Yeah,

2228
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:25,450
putting him in jail.
The reason he went to jail because he,

2229
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:30,750
before he wrote the book,
he was already at like a marijuana 

2230
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:32,890
activist for certain things.
There's so many ways you could fight for

2231
01:54:32,891 --> 01:54:37,891
marijuana,
but I forget exactly what he was 

2232
01:54:37,891 --> 01:54:37,891
fighting for.
In the very beginning.

2233
01:54:37,891 --> 01:54:38,980
He was protesting in front of a federal 
building.

2234
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:44,160
Reagan showed up.
Reagan a total people that federal 

2235
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:48,781
building have handled.
You had the cops come and arrest 

2236
01:54:48,781 --> 01:54:51,421
everybody.
All they had to do was pay like $20 a 

2237
01:54:51,421 --> 01:54:54,510
ticket or something.
He refused the pad and he went to jail 

2238
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:55,380
for a year.
Yeah,

2239
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:58,540
he went to jail.
That's where it was.

2240
01:54:58,541 --> 01:54:59,100
Good for him.
He,

2241
01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:01,270
that's where you had the time to write.
The emperor wears no clothes.

2242
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:03,360
Jaylen.
That's amazing.

2243
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:05,040
Yeah,
it's amazing.

2244
01:55:05,730 --> 01:55:08,370
It's a good book too.
It's really very detailed.

2245
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:13,230
If you want to know anything about the 
history of propaganda and the hemp being

2246
01:55:13,231 --> 01:55:18,231
made illegal,
everybody thinks that the reason why 

2247
01:55:18,231 --> 01:55:18,231
marijuana is illegal because it's bad 
for you.

2248
01:55:18,231 --> 01:55:20,550
I mean if you ask 100 people $75,
we got to tell you it's bad for you.

2249
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,260
It's something that doesn't bring it 
down,

2250
01:55:22,261 --> 01:55:25,230
which causes some problems,
but that's not why it's illegal.

2251
01:55:25,231 --> 01:55:28,830
It's illegal because when they figured 
out a way to process him,

2252
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:30,390
fibers more effectively.
That came up.

2253
01:55:30,391 --> 01:55:35,391
This thing called the decorticator.
There's a machine that grinds up to 

2254
01:55:35,391 --> 01:55:36,030
happen and them with the fibers easier 
to process.

2255
01:55:36,090 --> 01:55:40,780
William Randolph hearst owned the paper 
companies and he also owned newspapers.

2256
01:55:40,781 --> 01:55:41,800
So these paper companies,
you know,

2257
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:46,801
they make paper out of a fucking and 
this tap won't paper was much better as 

2258
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:49,740
far superior and it was a competing 
product so he wanted to make an illegal.

2259
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:54,740
So when he decided to do was print 
newspaper articles where they said that 

2260
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:55,470
blacks and Mexicans were raping white 
women.

2261
01:55:55,820 --> 01:56:00,820
I knew it and the reason why they were,
they said the reason why they were 

2262
01:56:00,961 --> 01:56:05,961
raping white women,
it's because they were smoking this new 

2263
01:56:05,961 --> 01:56:07,920
drug called marijuana.
So when Congress made marijuana illegal,

2264
01:56:07,921 --> 01:56:10,410
they didn't even know they're making the
textile,

2265
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:10,900
you know,
the,

2266
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:11,910
the,
the fabric,

2267
01:56:11,911 --> 01:56:12,290
the,
you know,

2268
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:17,300
all the things that hemp can make.
It didn't really even know they were 

2269
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:17,300
making that illegal to.
They have no idea.

2270
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:21,770
It's really completely ridiculous.
The fact that it's stuck from the 19 

2271
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:22,920
thirties all the way to here,
2010,

2272
01:56:22,921 --> 01:56:27,921
even though we know it's ridiculous.
I mean you can go right now what on the 

2273
01:56:27,921 --> 01:56:30,810
corner store and buy Jack Daniels and 
trick ourselves to death easy.

2274
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:35,130
We walked in with there right now,
we each bought a big ass bottle,

2275
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:37,700
a gallon jug of Jack Daniels.
All three of us in life.

2276
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:42,800
No one would bat an eye.
That's lethal doses we just bought 

2277
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:47,241
lethal dose is about,
and we can just come here and three of 

2278
01:56:47,241 --> 01:56:48,630
us would drink those drip down Jack 
tennis until her body literally shut the

2279
01:56:48,631 --> 01:56:49,260
fuck down.

2280
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:55,430
That sounds cool.
How crazy is it that people don't even 

2281
01:56:55,591 --> 01:56:58,050
bat an eye that marijuana should or 
shouldn't be illegal?

2282
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:00,970
It's,
of course it shouldn't be legal.

2283
01:57:00,971 --> 01:57:02,530
If you can go and buy Jack Daniels.

2284
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:03,450
Ridiculous.

2285
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,890
Ridiculous.
I'm fucking hungry.

2286
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:11,770
You know what?
End this thing.

2287
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:15,160
Good.
I think we've done enough.

2288
01:57:16,390 --> 01:57:19,240
I think we've already talked about.
So you know,

2289
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:23,290
I think they're born enough.
Anderson Silva,

2290
01:57:23,291 --> 01:57:25,700
Sandy's going to take all the UFC belt.
You know what?

2291
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:28,270
Maybe Anderson Silva's board at 185 
pounds.

2292
01:57:28,271 --> 01:57:33,271
Maybe.
That's the reason why his last 

2293
01:57:33,271 --> 01:57:33,690
performance wasn't up to par.
You know who the fuck knows man?

2294
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:36,310
You don't know until you're inside that 
dudes had no.

2295
01:57:36,311 --> 01:57:38,230
He's obviously brilliant.
You know,

2296
01:57:38,231 --> 01:57:40,840
and it's Friday and he's probably a very
complicated dude,

2297
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:46,140
you know,
but I think I would like to see him 

2298
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:46,140
challenged that Shell fight is gonna be 
very interesting.

2299
01:57:46,690 --> 01:57:51,690
Chael Simon's going to talk a lot of 
shit and he's going to attack it and 

2300
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:56,310
yeah,
August I think it's going to be in Salt 

2301
01:57:56,310 --> 01:57:56,960
Lake City.
Well,

2302
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:01,540
she also has a real good rest fucking 
well you should come in,

2303
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:06,541
which was really impressive because you 
should have time start to be like this 

2304
01:58:06,541 --> 01:58:07,030
real powerful grappler.
Chilson just manhandled them,

2305
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:10,150
grapple the shit out of him.
Daddy beat chess.

2306
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:12,720
Then it'd be a landmark for now.
I'm just like,

2307
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:17,800
oh,
that really opened a lot of people and 

2308
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:19,951
so now he gets his way.
He took on a really explosive with 

2309
01:58:19,951 --> 01:58:20,740
double leg take downs and you don't see 
that often.

2310
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:21,190
You see that?

2311
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:26,770
He does.
He's like GSP with wrestling.

2312
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:32,770
She fought Demian Maia before that and 
you've got triangled.

2313
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:36,690
You got a got taken down as soon as you 
hit him with like a lateral or some sort

2314
01:58:36,691 --> 01:58:38,050
of a thrill.
It's really impressive.

2315
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:42,070
And Damien mounted them and then stopped
the triangle from the mountain and pulls

2316
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:46,580
up on top of them and tapped into drag.
It's a really sweet is there too,

2317
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,240
but you know,
the Damien minor thing,

2318
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:51,340
you know,
if that guy catches,

2319
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:53,360
catches you,
he's really good at that.

2320
01:58:53,361 --> 01:58:55,180
And she also has been caught in the 
past.

2321
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:00,600
That would be an interesting thing.
If Anderson could submit him off of his 

2322
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:00,600
back,
that would be fantastic.

2323
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,720
Because you know,
Chael Sonnen at some point in time,

2324
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:04,300
Anderson doesn't lock them out 
immediately.

2325
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:06,130
So someone's going to have Anderson not 
as back,

2326
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:09,010
you know,
invested catches them was coming in,

2327
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,360
which is always possible.
But they understand

2328
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:14,440
crawling,
feeling tight,

2329
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:19,720
close.
There's going to take a submission to 

2330
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,230
friends in the guard and passing the 
garden a little more serious.

2331
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:23,020
I have a feeling.
Yeah,

2332
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:25,700
I don't think he's gonna come out 
because he gets caught off guard because

2333
01:59:25,701 --> 01:59:27,860
he likes the column in the garland pound
in the garden.

2334
01:59:27,861 --> 01:59:29,130
You can get caught,
you know,

2335
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:31,440
look at that car and airbnb kind of 
caught,

2336
01:59:31,610 --> 01:59:32,840
you know.
And he's awesome.

2337
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:36,130
He's awesome at Jujitsu,
but it wants shale.

2338
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:41,260
Finally realizes that it needs to get 
really good at passing and mounting and 

2339
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:45,101
taken aback flock once he realizes that 
he needs to adapt the GSP strategy.

2340
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:52,900
Once he looks at GSP fights and says,
Holy Shit I should be doing with GSP is 

2341
01:59:52,911 --> 01:59:57,911
doing.
Once he makes that decision will be 

2342
01:59:57,911 --> 01:59:59,900
unstoppable.
Serious reason why he does great,

2343
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:02,030
but then you know he loses,
he does great,

2344
02:00:02,031 --> 02:00:07,031
but he moves his because he is not 
taking guard,

2345
02:00:08,001 --> 02:00:11,600
passing and being safe in the garden and
taking guard,

2346
02:00:11,601 --> 02:00:16,520
passing as the number one priority over 
and power in that and the full guard.

2347
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:20,520
The only should really pound in before 
God to open shit out.

2348
02:00:20,521 --> 02:00:23,510
Like passing should be your number one 
focus.

2349
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:27,080
Look at GSP passing is this number one 
focus.

2350
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,200
That is the correct attitude.
That's important.

2351
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:32,740
Strategy.
Jackson said about GSP.

2352
02:00:33,180 --> 02:00:38,180
Greg Jackson said the fact that he 
didn't want to GSP to pass the 

2353
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:38,180
gardening.
We took it down.

2354
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:39,490
He said,
just don't pass his garbage route.

2355
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:43,950
He was.
He was being could it

2356
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:49,720
saying you couldn't pass his guard,
that he wasn't passing it and he was 

2357
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:49,720
like,
I guess we thought he was wasting energy

2358
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:52,120
just wanting to feed them up from inside
the guard.

2359
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,550
You know that.
Then she goes towards good from the half

2360
02:00:54,551 --> 02:00:54,850
guard.

2361
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:03,140
You didn't get it.
I don't agree with that strategy at all 

2362
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:03,930
ever.
I would never do that,

2363
02:01:03,931 --> 02:01:08,931
but I can understand it in a way where I
can see that the after GSP passes guard 

2364
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:13,620
and Martyrdom Dang hard.
It would give this back.

2365
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:16,650
Then he would post up and then 
eventually shake them off and they would

2366
02:01:16,651 --> 02:01:19,510
stand up again that every time.
So you've got.

2367
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:22,430
Jackson was looking at it as like it'd 
be past the guards amount.

2368
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:26,340
The NIGGA that mentioned stand up as it 
gets back up and it gets up.

2369
02:01:26,430 --> 02:01:29,640
So I think just do it.
Just like staying this guard.

2370
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:32,500
He can't get up from there.
He can't get up from the guard,

2371
02:01:32,501 --> 02:01:34,640
he can't get up once it gets back,
you know.

2372
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:38,070
So just standard gardens,
get the w don't take a fucking chance on

2373
02:01:38,071 --> 02:01:39,750
this guy.
That's like the

2374
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:44,420
super conservative strategy,
which I understand,

2375
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:49,600
but I think GSP was doing five and I 
think you should always go for the 

2376
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:52,420
finish and always go for the past almost
twice.

2377
02:01:52,421 --> 02:01:52,920
He almost had,

2378
02:01:53,680 --> 02:01:54,670
so yeah,
you don't.

2379
02:01:54,671 --> 02:01:57,360
You don't want to.
You don't want your job,

2380
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:01,480
and they were working on it afterwards.
They're working on tightening.

2381
02:02:01,481 --> 02:02:06,481
What he was doing wrong with setting up 
is Kamora telling him to hit it at a 

2382
02:02:06,481 --> 02:02:06,481
different angle.
I don't know.

2383
02:02:06,481 --> 02:02:11,430
I don't remember how he did it.
Did you have to leg over the face in San

2384
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:15,370
Controller to the other leg over the 
face?

2385
02:02:15,450 --> 02:02:19,690
I don't remember what side control,
but that gap.

2386
02:02:19,930 --> 02:02:24,930
The Camorra looks strong.
The arm bar looks strong for a couple 

2387
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:24,930
seconds,
man.

2388
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:28,300
I'm bobby's been back way back for a 
couple seconds to Dan Hardee just rented

2389
02:02:28,301 --> 02:02:30,060
it out.
We'll just face the mat.

2390
02:02:30,190 --> 02:02:34,930
Turned himself over and Dan only had two
scratches on his under his right eye and

2391
02:02:34,931 --> 02:02:39,370
he wasn't hurt as arms refine and some 
may has amazing that he went five rounds

2392
02:02:39,371 --> 02:02:41,590
of GSP and he barely had a couple of 
mics on it.

2393
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:45,700
Go back and ask you this man.
No parties a tough dude.

2394
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,460
He's such a smart guy too.
So good at shit.

2395
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:51,810
Talking so good at those interviews that
I have.

2396
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:53,110
You know,
it's like,

2397
02:02:53,111 --> 02:02:56,860
it's such a tricky thing because in one 
way that's like Kinda like anti,

2398
02:02:56,890 --> 02:03:01,890
like with the martial arts is supposed 
to stand for talking shit and you know 

2399
02:03:01,890 --> 02:03:03,850
that when dudes do talk shit they make 
it so much more interesting.

2400
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:09,320
Yeah.
I think they talk shit back in ancient 

2401
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:11,161
times.
Like Samurais against we dudes and all 

2402
02:03:11,161 --> 02:03:11,161
that.
I said I think they touched it.

2403
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:11,530
Yeah.

2404
02:03:13,870 --> 02:03:15,960
It's a tactic.
It fucks with people's heads.

2405
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:16,630
Jumped ship.

2406
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:24,080
Terrible.
My Dick doesn't want to make you 

2407
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:31,280
something like that.
What is it is a tactic,

2408
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:34,400
you know,
fucking dudes heads.

2409
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:39,460
It is like a legitimate technique.
The problem is that everyone thinks 

2410
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:41,110
they're doing so well and I like rarely 
actually feels people off their games.

2411
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:45,050
That was witty issues sometimes to mix 
it.

2412
02:03:45,051 --> 02:03:50,051
Douchey.
The two guys are just talking shit to 

2413
02:03:50,051 --> 02:03:50,051
each other now sometimes you know,
you know,

2414
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:55,450
but when guys are good at it,
but it wasn't like personal interview.

2415
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:58,160
I'm going to be honest with you,

2416
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:03,220
I got when I'm going to go out and give 
it my all,

2417
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:06,220
that's all I can do.
What else do you want me to do?

2418
02:04:08,610 --> 02:04:09,370
Here's the deal,
man.

2419
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:12,050
I don't really have a lot of job 
options.

2420
02:04:12,110 --> 02:04:14,070
I need some money,
you know,

2421
02:04:14,090 --> 02:04:15,680
and it's not a lot of money,
but fuck it.

2422
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:20,681
I need to fight and you know,
seeing that it's going to be a sound on 

2423
02:04:20,681 --> 02:04:22,270
tv a couple of times and I thought,
you know what?

2424
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:27,580
I'm to make some cash with that.
My favorite was Anderson and one of the 

2425
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:29,060
times when they go back and forth,
it'll tell you what,

2426
02:04:29,061 --> 02:04:34,061
that guy said it.
You say something and it goes like 

2427
02:04:34,061 --> 02:04:34,061
divorced guy.
I said,

2428
02:04:34,061 --> 02:04:34,061
well,
he's fucking drama school.

2429
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:34,880
But.
So,

2430
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:36,110
uh,
they said you don't understand.

2431
02:04:36,111 --> 02:04:37,680
Like I said,
he's going to get you down,

2432
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,420
you know,
Algebra submission.

2433
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,670
It was just like,
that's a great tactic.

2434
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:43,710
You know what I'm saying?

2435
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:51,000
That's the smart way,
smart way to tell her that Anderson is 

2436
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:51,810
pretty good when it comes to cit 
talking,

2437
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:54,960
how casual economy gets,
but apparently it gets very angry.

2438
02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:57,370
I mean,
when you saw that Chael Sonnen fight men

2439
02:04:57,750 --> 02:05:00,450
or the rather Damien Maia fight,
he gets real angry,

2440
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:03,990
you know Damien Maia,
whatever the Fuck David am I said really

2441
02:05:03,991 --> 02:05:08,991
made him bananas and that second round,
I don't know what the fuck was said a 

2442
02:05:08,991 --> 02:05:13,131
lot,
but have you ever seen him like that 

2443
02:05:13,131 --> 02:05:13,131
before?
Ever?

2444
02:05:13,131 --> 02:05:13,131
Just screaming,
screaming shit,

2445
02:05:13,131 --> 02:05:17,661
talking like that never would have been.
What would happen again in mind when he 

2446
02:05:17,661 --> 02:05:21,090
bought boots and an Anderson Silva's and
what a Danny Meyer started doing.

2447
02:05:21,091 --> 02:05:26,091
Some fucking windmill break would stop.
What if it just started to break?

2448
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:33,210
That's crazy.
It's like right in the middle.

2449
02:05:33,211 --> 02:05:37,200
You just started break dancing.
You know that thing where it's like they

2450
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:37,930
don't dress it.

2451
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:40,260
They spend.
That would be awesome.

2452
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:44,220
I could do that.
George St Pierre to break dance.

2453
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:49,520
You remember?
He used to do that a little bit and 

2454
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:49,520
something's really,
really good when you attack someone like

2455
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:54,411
that,
like he just fucking spun out a big 

2456
02:05:54,411 --> 02:05:55,800
propeller energy.
People imagine that's a fucking break.

2457
02:05:55,801 --> 02:05:57,020
That would be bad ass,
man.

2458
02:05:57,030 --> 02:06:02,030
I bet the break dancers would start 
making up like this and it was fucking 

2459
02:06:03,421 --> 02:06:08,421
switched positions and they can break 
down a break dance card to have capital 

2460
02:06:09,031 --> 02:06:12,090
or a gun together with break dancing and
it created a new.

2461
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:17,400
Marsha said,
let's spending like a tsunami of things.

2462
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:28,530
Just dive in.
You're going to get fucking balls and go

2463
02:06:28,531 --> 02:06:33,290
right to the headspin when you spend on 
your head and then slide your legs out.

2464
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:34,410
Fucking.
Yeah.

2465
02:06:35,850 --> 02:06:38,500
Yeah,
it'd be great.

2466
02:06:39,510 --> 02:06:44,510
I think that's probably a good board yet
we're talking about.

2467
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:52,740
Yeah.
Let's talk about that real quick while 

2468
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:52,800
you're here.
What did you think about Shinya Aoki?

2469
02:06:52,830 --> 02:06:55,730
Gilbert Melendez.
Very interesting fight.

2470
02:06:56,990 --> 02:07:01,990
You know,
Gilbert Melendez is awesome and the 

2471
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:04,170
guard and he did a great job at staying 
away from any danger in it.

2472
02:07:04,290 --> 02:07:07,620
I think maybe once or twice Aoki at m 
and ms dot controlling,

2473
02:07:07,621 --> 02:07:12,621
smashed against the cage.
That was a bad mother fucker know 

2474
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,090
Gilbert Times.
Awesome.

2475
02:07:15,091 --> 02:07:17,370
Timing is standing up,
was wicked.

2476
02:07:17,490 --> 02:07:19,140
He stayed on top of him.
You know what I mean?

2477
02:07:19,141 --> 02:07:21,090
The only way that strategy was going to 
work for him,

2478
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:22,650
you know,
state avoiding the gardens,

2479
02:07:22,651 --> 02:07:24,300
if he could beat him in standard 
exchanges,

2480
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:28,550
and it definitely did because he lived 
in these theaters.

2481
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:29,790
Deacon is asked,
you know,

2482
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:34,260
that that really map the risks,
wants enforcement on.

2483
02:07:34,261 --> 02:07:34,650
That was good.

2484
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,740
He got,
he got the arm trapped a couple times,

2485
02:07:38,741 --> 02:07:40,840
but typically just right the fuck out of
it.

2486
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:44,360
And it was never in any danger at all.
So that was a big fight for him,

2487
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:49,600
don't.
He's just not as good with the fucking 

2488
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:51,330
with regular shorts.
So it was Jay shows contract 

2489
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:51,330
demonstrated for us because it 
supposedly.

2490
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:51,880
Yeah.
Which is amazing,

2491
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:57,200
but if they really let him fight without
a contract saying that if he wins that 

2492
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:58,720
he's still in contract.
I don't know how that stuff works.

2493
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:02,020
I didn't know you could do that.
I guess you can if you're not willing to

2494
02:08:02,021 --> 02:08:07,021
sign a new contract against him.
So he felt like.

2495
02:08:09,510 --> 02:08:13,680
I think jake shields was upset because 
he felt like they were not respected.

2496
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:19,330
They didn't promote him enough day.
Mostly.

2497
02:08:19,390 --> 02:08:24,390
Most of the promotion that they had was 
mentioning Dan Henderson and because he 

2498
02:08:24,670 --> 02:08:29,670
was on his last fight to be a big deal,
I mean Dan's a legend from to time pride

2499
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:35,590
champion in two different weight 
classes.

2500
02:08:35,591 --> 02:08:37,690
So that was a big deal for them.
A big acquisition.

2501
02:08:37,691 --> 02:08:39,070
They thought he was going to be the big 
star,

2502
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:41,920
so they,
they were hoping that jake shields would

2503
02:08:41,921 --> 02:08:42,580
lose,
I guess,

2504
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:47,850
given the right away the other guy off 
this first fight,

2505
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:51,280
the first fight in the organizations and
title fight,

2506
02:08:51,610 --> 02:08:56,610
you know,
on CBS and a crazy ass fucking fight to 

2507
02:08:56,610 --> 02:09:01,510
whoever thought that jake shields bill 
to take Dan Henderson down that many 

2508
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,510
times.
Just order pizza and watch it.

2509
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:05,110
All right then.
That's it.

2510
02:09:05,111 --> 02:09:10,111
Ladies and gentlemen,
this was the first annual for 20 

2511
02:09:10,111 --> 02:09:10,111
podcasts.
Uh,

2512
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:12,260
I think we've got some good shit we 
talked about in there.

2513
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:17,630
I think we lost the train of 
conversation too much potato chips 

2514
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:23,010
you're going to have,
considering the fact that we got 

2515
02:09:23,010 --> 02:09:26,470
completely vaporized.
It was a really,

2516
02:09:26,471 --> 02:09:27,110
uh,
it was,

2517
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:32,140
it was not bad.
Next week I should have couches in here 

2518
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:36,010
and it'll be all set up and then the 
week after that it will be my twitter.

2519
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:37,720
Yeah,
twitter is Eddie Bravo,

2520
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:39,250
twitter APP.
Eddie Bravo.

2521
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:44,470
Every bottle for Joe Rogan.net.
I'm trying to get Joe Rogan.

2522
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:50,150
If you got Joe Rogan hollow out and they
go,

2523
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:51,930
let me know.
I like to get that stuff.

2524
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:53,290
Thanks guys.
Later.

2525
02:09:57,230 --> 02:09:59,100
You ever broke one of his bags?

2526
02:10:14,940 --> 02:10:19,940
Firefox is frozen again.
This is the second time that I've shut 

2527
02:10:33,601 --> 02:10:35,640
this off and so everybody can still hear
me right now.

2528
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:38,990
It won't let me log out.
Was it.
