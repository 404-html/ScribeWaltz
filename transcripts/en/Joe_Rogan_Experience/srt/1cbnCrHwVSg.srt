1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,090
Hello freaks,

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,463
we're live.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,160
It took a while,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,940
but we're here.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,670
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by carbonite.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,241
Oh,

7
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,074
look at that.

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,483
I'm consistent.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Carbonite is a way to back up your files
online automatically without you even

10
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,200
have to thinking about half to thinking
about having to think about it.

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,270
More people working from laptops today,

12
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:29,340
giving them mobility and flexibility,

13
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:29,791
and in fact,

14
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:33,570
60% of workers use laptops as
their primary work computer,

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,550
but computer disasters can happen anytime
and anywhere affecting not only your

16
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,840
business files,

17
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:43,980
but possibly even every computer
that operates in your business.

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,780
That's why you need carbonite.

19
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:49,530
Online backup and laptops
can be expecially,

20
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,240
especially that's what George Bush says.

21
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:56,241
It especially vulnerable because 33%
of stolen laptops are taken from the

22
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:57,181
office.

23
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:02,181
28% from cars and about 12,000 laptops
are lost every week at US airports.

24
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,340
That's pretty ridiculous,

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,750
but if you have carbonite,

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,670
you'll have peace of mind
that you're backed up.

27
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,830
Files are always safe.

28
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:13,320
No matter what happens to your laptop.

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,180
Carbonite backs up your computer
files to the cloud automatically and

30
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,014
continually.

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,740
No matter how many computers your
business has or where they're located,

32
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,290
we rely on carbonate carbonate.

33
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,183
We were not,

34
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,600
were not very convincing,

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,793
but we mean it.

36
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,260
We rely on Carbonite to back up the
files here for the Joe Rogan experience

37
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:34,801
podcast.

38
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,490
It's super easy.

39
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:35,791

00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,451

it's great.

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,570
It's,

43
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,760
it's a peace of mind.

63
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:23,691

Yes.

68
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,840

I t if you haven't been
to on it for a while.

104
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,950
We have a lot of new products

105
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,440
uh,

106
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,460
the primal bells,

107
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,110
which are all apes,

108
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,430
chimpanzee,

109
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,151
gorilla,

110
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,170
Orangutan,

111
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,450
and now a howler monkey,

112
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,740
which I guess isn't really an ape.

113
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,750
It's a monkey and an ape.

114
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,093
How's that work?

115
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,463
There's an April monkey.

116
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,320
I Dunno.

117
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,920
No,

118
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,280
no,

119
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,113
it's not right.

120
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,571
It's a tail,

121
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:56,801
right?

122
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,150
The tails.

123
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,641
The difference.

124
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:57,980
Right.

125
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,120
Cause I wouldn't have been quite
clear the ape shit a bit there to us.

126
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,560
Fair bit there to them.

127
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,360
One of the other one or the other.

128
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:04,811
But,

129
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,140
um,

130
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,410
these are all what they are is
functional workout equipment.

131
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,210
That is also awesome looking,

132
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:10,840
uh,

133
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,120
designed by Steven Shubin Junior,

134
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,990
who is an artist that on at higher
to create these bad ass designs.

135
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,830
Uh,

136
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,720
they're all three d balanced as well,

137
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,230
unlike,

138
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,500
um,

139
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,801
there's,

140
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,491
there's some other,

141
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:23,950
a kettle bells out there
that are a artistic,

142
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,210
but they're not balanced.

143
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,410
One of the more important parts of
creating these was that we wanted to make

144
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,770
sure that they were functional
for actually working out with,

145
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,311
uh,

146
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:33,761
so we,

147
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:38,470
we went above and beyond to make sure
that the d balanced and you can work out

148
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,810
with them just like a
regular kettle bells.

149
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,900
They just look more awesome.

150
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,950
We sell all sorts of other things
that ana including supplements,

151
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,300

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,850
ladies and gentlemen,

Graham Hancock gold whirlwind tour
across nations for many months.

179
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,310
And you're finally here in November,

180
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,590
2013 today's date is the
13th and you've been,

181
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,310
you've been it hearts in September.

182
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,960
I have been on the road since the second
day of September between and between

183
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,420
Dave had maybe like five days at home,

184
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,280
but the rest of the time
I've been traveling.

185
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:07,641
I've been,

186
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,121
let's see,

187
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,200
I've been in Turkey,

188
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,610
I've been all over Turkey,

189
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,451
amazing country.

190
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,980
My first ever visit to Turkey.

191
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,270
Did you got to do go back to,

192
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,500
I went to go back to the Tempe.

193
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,080
I spent more than a week at Gabelli Tempe.

194
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,360
I met Klaus Schmidt,

195
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:24,080
who's the actually rather decent
German archaeologist who is excavating

196
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:24,440
correctly.

197
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,800
Tempe.

198
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,630
I very rarely get on with archeologists,

199
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,800
but I got on with Klaus Schmidt.

200
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,790
I don't think he knew who I was but,

201
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,650
but somehow he was charming and he
gave us a lot of access to the site.

202
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:37,190
He led Santa get right in amongst
the pillars and then photograph them.

203
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,060
And we had a good time.

204
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,290
So over there and then took
the opportunity of being
in Turkey to travel over a

205
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,340
lot of the rest of the country.

206
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,400
There's some cool stuff that is like
what they call underground cities,

207
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,750
which go down eight,

208
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:49,040
10 stories under the,

209
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,933
under the earth.

210
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,720
The idea was that people build
them to hide from their enemies,

211
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,740
but in my opinion,

212
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:58,050
the last thing you'd want to do if you
were hiding from your enemies is wall

213
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,770
yourself up in some underground place
where all they have to do is just put a

214
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,990
stone across the door and you're done for,

215
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,210
I think they had some
other function than that.

216
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:05,901
So yeah,

217
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:06,890
we drove all over Turkey,

218
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:07,970
so a lot of amazing stuff.

219
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,971
Came back to England briefly then went
straight to Peru and Bolivia up in the,

220
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,740
up in the high Andes reached
a place in a hired car,

221
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,750
15,000 feet above sea level,

222
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,130
just over 15,000 feet.

223
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:23,120
That seriously high,

224
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,160
shorter breath up there.

225
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:25,971
And,

226
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:26,091
uh,

227
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:26,691
that was,

228
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:26,871
uh,

229
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:31,871
that was on the way to a site called
shoving one tar where they venerated

230
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,300
psychedelics in ancient times.

231
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,980
And uh,

232
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,910
also visited te Minako in
the Andes where in Bolivia,

233
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,620
where I've been a number of times before.

234
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,820
Fantastic place.

235
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,660
Uh,

236
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,890
came back from there,

237
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,780
went to South Africa,

238
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,360
spent five days in South Africa,

239
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,930
got on a plane immediately after returning
from South Africa and came to the

240
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,501
United States.

241
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,940
And I've been in the u s for the last two,

242
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,750
two and a half weeks.

243
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,111
Wow.

244
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,320
We got to get you some vitamin.

245
00:07:58,321 --> 00:07:58,620
Sorry.

246
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,330
I need vitamins.

247
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,600
We really need to get you,

248
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:00,991
do you,

249
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:02,270
do you follow a healthy diet?

250
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,523
Well,

251
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,760
in a way I don't,

252
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,750
I don't eat meat.

253
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,260
I don't eat.

254
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,130
Maybe that's not healthy.

255
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:07,431
I don't,

256
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:08,181
I don't eat red meat.

257
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:08,931
I don't eat chicken.

258
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:09,260
I eat,

259
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,510
but I pick on shrimps and
scallops and things like that.

260
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:12,500
Otherwise I'm a vegetarian.

261
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,540
So fish and vegetables,

262
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,643
I don't eat fish.

263
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,250
No,

264
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,083
it has a backbone.

265
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,820
I don't eat things which I
don't eat things with backbones.

266
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,140
Only the when,

267
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,420
what,

268
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,050
what brought this about and I walk a trip.

269
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,710
No,

270
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,101
no,

271
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:28,640
I bought way back in 1986
when I was 36 years old,

272
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,460
I realized that I didn't
enjoy meat very much.

273
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,061
So I thought,

274
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,470
why did I become a vegetarian?

275
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,470
I became a vegetarian when not
for years and years and years.

276
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,430
Then I got bored.

277
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,800
I got seriously board with vegetarian
diet and I'd always liked shrimps and

278
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,790
scallops and shell fish of all kinds,

279
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,170
lobster,

280
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:44,960
stuff like that.

281
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,460
So I went back and started,

282
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,080
I lapsed and I started eating shellfish
and that's kind of where I drew the line

283
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:51,740
that I would,

284
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,110
I would eat as far away
from myself as possible.

285
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,870
Uh,

286
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,070
but I would definitely have

287
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,940
some flesh.

288
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,690
And so I,

289
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,710
I pick on these,

290
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,850
these creatures,

291
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,070
there's not particular
moral reason for it.

292
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:02,790
It's just a,

293
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,720
it's just what I like to do.

294
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,800
It seems a bit more,

295
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,770
although if you're trying to eat things
that are as far away from the post.

296
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:08,820
So I suppose so,

297
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:09,990
but wouldn't it be ironic if,

298
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,830
if I were to discover when I pass through
the veil to the next world that the

299
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:17,430
one thing that you're not
allowed to eat ever shrimps.

300
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,613
Imagine that.

301
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,080
I highly doubt there's
dietary requirements.

302
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,220
I highly doubt it too.

303
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,880
I had,

304
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,200
everything is temporary.

305
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:26,034
I mean we don't,

306
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:26,611
part of,

307
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:27,840
I think what's,

308
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,100
what's great about being a vegetarian or
being a Vegan is that you don't want to

309
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:32,900
take a life.

310
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,240
Yeah,

311
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,110
I appreciate that.

312
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:35,700
That's kind of what it
comes down to for me.

313
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,260
I appreciate that very much.

314
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,183
However,

315
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,450
lives are taking the manner what all
the time and you take life when you eat

316
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:43,200
vegetables,

317
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,970
you just take a different
type type of life.

318
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,480
Hey Life,

319
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,980
I'm wearing a leather belt right now.

320
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,060
I'm wearing leather shoes.

321
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,400
I took life to life,

322
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:52,170
eats life and it's not just animal life,

323
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:55,290
but plant life and fungal
life and all these,

324
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
I mean I see the point.

325
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,960
I just think it's a little short
sighted and utopian the view.

326
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,640
The view is just a little delusional.

327
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,590
But I appreciate the thought
and the sentiment behind me.

328
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,331
If I,

329
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:06,751
if I,

330
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,370
if I really enjoyed meat,

331
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,170
even chicken or red meat,

332
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,010
if I really enjoyed it,

333
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:11,521
I would eat it.

334
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,180
But I don't,

335
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,840
I never got,

336
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,920
I never got much out of it.

337
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:14,191
I never,

338
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:16,470
I was always a bit squeamish
about the blood and I never,

339
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,670
I never really wanted to eat it.

340
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,410
So I kind of felt it's a waste.

341
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,120
I don't,

342
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,900
I get no pleasure from this stuff,

343
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,381
so why?

344
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,790
So why should I eat it anyway?

345
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,070
That's why I say it's not
entirely a moral thing.

346
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,540
It's partly just a matter
of preference as well.

347
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,381
But I agree with you.

348
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,860
I mean everything in the web of
life on this planet lives off,

349
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,180
lives off everything else.

350
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,510
Uh,

351
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:36,960
I think,

352
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,750
I think maybe in our society,

353
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,550
in western technological society,

354
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,061
you know,

355
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:45,570
we've got so divorced from the act of
actually killing an animal that we forget

356
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:46,290
what we're doing.

357
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,730
We forget what's involved.

358
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,150
It's all very packaged and
sanitized and it's easy.

359
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,800
It's easy to forget what's involved in it,

360
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,250
that some,

361
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,083
some creature is,

362
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,110
is dying.

363
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,090
And in our culture of pretty unpleasant,

364
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,870
miserable death.

365
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,381
I agree.

366
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,050
And I think that that
separation is very immoral.

367
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,080
That separation between us and
our food to try to reconcile that.

368
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,650
I've recently taken up hunting,

369
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,190
I went hunting last year for the first
time and got a deer and killed it and

370
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,500
gutted it and quartered it and all
that jazz and eating it was incredibly

371
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:17,334
satisfying.

372
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,740
And also knowing that where I went,

373
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,580
these animals,

374
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,510
they're not going to make it,

375
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,590
no animal makes it,

376
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,880
but what the idea is,

377
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,100
you just breed as quickly as you can.

378
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,580
Your children live for a couple of years
and then they get taken out by mountain

379
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:31,080
lions or coyotes or the winter,

380
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,240
either freeze to death or what have you.

381
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,920
But it's a constant cycle.

382
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,590
And what I did is just
dip into that cycle.

383
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,540
And I think that's,

384
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,340
I have no problem with that.

385
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,530
And,

386
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,320
and you know,

387
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,501
it's,

388
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,110
it's much better actually go
hunt an animal rather than the,

389
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:49,380
the horrible cold industrial
slaughterhouses that we
have that we have now.

390
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:52,200
And the fear and humiliation the
animals are put through in that,

391
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,410
in that context,

392
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,250
at least,

393
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,090
at least in hunting,

394
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:55,330
it's,

395
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:55,870
it's kind of,

396
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,230
it's kind of one to one and,

397
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:57,791
and you are,

398
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,960
you are out there,

399
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,720
you're,

400
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,150
you're actually killing what you eat
and the animal lives in entirely wild,

401
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:06,610
natural life until the
moment you pull that trigger.

402
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:06,850
Yeah.

403
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,930
There's no,

404
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,320
there's,

405
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,470
there's no artificial
environment that it lives in.

406
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,810
There's no hormones and are
introduced into its body,

407
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,040
no antibiotics.

408
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,170
There's nothing unnatural about it at all.

409
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,310
Just the bullet hits it and that's
gone and it's over and it's virtually

410
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,770
painless because when a bullet
hits an animal like that,

411
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:26,260
I mean it's so fast and so quick,

412
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:27,370
they don't even know what happened.

413
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,630
They try to run and then they're done.

414
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,111
They're done.

415
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:29,600
You know,

416
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,770
and I think I would,

417
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,170
what I'm trying to do,

418
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,520
and I'm trying to do it this year,

419
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:34,301
by the end of this year,

420
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,730
I want to make my diet when I'm home,

421
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:37,564
when I can control it.

422
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,250
Completely wild game.

423
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,450
That's my goal.

424
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,111
While game,

425
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:41,710
which you will hook.

426
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,220
Yes.

427
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,900
Which I will hunt and for me and for my
whole family and I have this mapped out

428
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,981
this year,

429
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:49,330
I want to get deer,

430
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:50,590
I want to get a bison,

431
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,180
I want to get an elk and I would get
all these various animals and just do it

432
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,010
entirely to procure meat and to bring
it back home and deep freeze it and to

433
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,690
make sure that I always have wild,

434
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:03,760
natural meat available
if I want to eat it.

435
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,121
Well.

436
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:04,931
Before I went hunting,

437
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:08,440
I decided that I'm either going to
be a vegetarian after this trip.

438
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,140
I'm neither going to decide
that this is like really not me.

439
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,240
I don't really like it or
I'm going to become a hunter,

440
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,320
so I became a hunter.

441
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:14,910
Right.

442
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,790
I enjoy it.

443
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,690
I've always liked meat,

444
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,100
but I think it's also
because I participate so much
in like really strenuous

445
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:21,934
exercise,

446
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,250
Jujitsu and martial arts and yeah,

447
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,060
which requires,

448
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,760
requires you to have some
protein in your body.

449
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,410
There's no doubt about it.

450
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,420
Makes me crave it.

451
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,530
I don't know if I need it.

452
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,970
I know there's many people that work out
very hard that go on a completely plant

453
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:34,660
based Diet.

454
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,493
But for me,

455
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,010
I dunno,

456
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,240
whatever I think I need.

457
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,320
It varies from patient to patient.

458
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:40,690
But the hunting that you do or that you,

459
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,990
that you did to get this animal do,

460
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,590
I mean are you out there in nature?

461
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,160
Is it,

462
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,791
what's the scene?

463
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,390
How does it work?

464
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,530
I went to um,

465
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,360
well going next week actually,

466
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,790
but the first time I
went I went to Montana,

467
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,350
the badlands and Montana,

468
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,560
Montana actually where Lewis and
Clark went down the Missouri River.

469
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,340
It was fascinating because
it's incredibly wild.

470
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:00,851
I mean,

471
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:02,930
we saw we were there as a wild lab.

472
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,850
There's a lot of wildlife,

473
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,690
especially with Montana because
you can't grow out there.

474
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,930
So homesteaders tried to make these homes
out there and live and we took these

475
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:13,570
photos of him.

476
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,190
I should have brought some photos back,

477
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:20,191
but we took photos of these old homesteads
tights from the seven from the 18

478
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,850
hundreds and you know,

479
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:22,740
they're just rotted out.

480
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,280
Nobody could grow anything out of there.

481
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,510
And then the Indians,

482
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:25,751
the,

483
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,460
the natives wind up
killing a lot of people.

484
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,400
There was a lot of like between the Nez
Perce and all these people that lived

485
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:32,110
there and um,

486
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,861
the,

487
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:33,910
the time we were there,

488
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:38,620
we were there for about five days and
maybe we saw five or six other people the

489
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:41,980
entire time and they were just people
going down the river and canoes doing the

490
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:42,461
same thing,

491
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:43,240
hunting.

492
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,830
So you're having a wilderness experience,

493
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,690
there's a photo of it up there.

494
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:46,930
That's,

495
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,711
that's what it looked like.

496
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:49,600
It was completely wild.

497
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,980
No cell phone service,

498
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,741
no Internet,

499
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:52,380
no nothing.

500
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,950
Sleeping in a tent for five days.

501
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,850
Very,

502
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,720
very intense.

503
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,770
Very refreshing to like,

504
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,640
that was one of the things that I've
found fascinating about him going to bed

505
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:02,480
when it got dark.

506
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,310
Getting up in the morning
when it got light.

507
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,600
No cell phone service,

508
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:06,200
no,

509
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,011
no internet,

510
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:07,311
no,

511
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:07,551
no.

512
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:08,630
Dealing with social media,

513
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,810
none of that nonsense that
we're constantly inundated
with on a daily basis.

514
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:12,260
Yeah,

515
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,490
I enjoyed it very much.

516
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,163
But um,

517
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,660
but you're not hunting an
animal that can hunt you back.

518
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,643
That's true.

519
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,660
But the animals that can
hunt you back are not really,

520
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,620
they're not really edible.

521
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:26,530
You can eat some of them I guess you
can eat grizzly bear like some people in

522
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,330
Montana or in Alaska eat grizzly.

523
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,411
I think they,

524
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:30,730
uh,

525
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,960
make grizzly jerky out of it and
some parts you can eat and outline.

526
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,400
You can eat the loin of a mountain lion,

527
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:39,290
apparently not really delicious.

528
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,820
It's not the best game.

529
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,300
Animals are essentially animals that are
all running from predators and you just

530
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,170
take part in that.

531
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,040
You just get,

532
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,510
you just get into the scramble.

533
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,291
You know,

534
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,250
in South Africa,

535
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:52,160
in the Kalahari desert of Namibia,

536
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,210
the Bushman there,

537
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,410
they would run animal style persistence,

538
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,244
hunting them down,

539
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,081
run them down.

540
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,990
They will run for like
12 hours just running,

541
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:00,261
running,

542
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:02,000
running until finally
the animal just says,

543
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,790
I'm done.

544
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,410
Yeah,

545
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,310
I've watched that.

546
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,870
I've watched that and videos online.

547
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:06,561
It's fascinating.

548
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:07,100
Amazing.

549
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,750
Native Americans used to do that as well.

550
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,520
Human beings are a rare animal
and that we can't outrun animals.

551
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,410
We can't like out speed them.

552
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,640
But we can keep going.

553
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,400
We can keep going for a long time.

554
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,140
And some animals just overheat.

555
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,550
They can't sweat,

556
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,271
you know,

557
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:23,811
and so they're,

558
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:26,690
they're designed for like these quick
sprints to get away from trouble.

559
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,450
But if we're just persistent
and we keep after them.

560
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,750
There's a podcast that I've
been listening to those was,

561
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:36,140
it was recommended by one of
the nurses at the Regina King,

562
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,970
Regina King,

563
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,570
however you say it,

564
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,350
the laboratory when I'm going to get
some blood work done called radio lab and

565
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:47,351
it dealt with this one particular tribe
in Kenya that has so many successful

566
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:52,580
runners right from this one particular
area and they were trying to figure out,

567
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:56,540
they did all these studies
to try to figure out what
made them so successful and

568
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,650
there was several factors.

569
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,300
One of them was their body shape.

570
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,830
One of them was the fact that they ran
to and from school on a regular basis.

571
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:04,760
They were constantly running.

572
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,720
But the other one was this
unbelievably brutal tribal ritual,

573
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:12,830
this coming of age ritual that the men
and the women went through the involve

574
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:17,150
genital mutilation with the men that and
involve the circumcision with a c sharp

575
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:17,984
stick.

576
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,290
And they would cover their face
with mud while they did this.

577
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,120
And if they crack the mud,

578
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:26,300
if they like squinted or Winston pain,

579
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,010
then they would be labeled a coward and
they would not have access to women.

580
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:31,590
They would like,

581
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,810
they would be cut out of the
economic situation in the tribe.

582
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,290
It's the most recent radio lab folks.

583
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,981
So if you,

584
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:40,250
uh,

585
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,050
I was recommended to me this,

586
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:46,310
this happens to these as a young man and
just entering puberty or who was at 13,

587
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,620
13,

588
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,560
and I think 17.

589
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:49,380
They said they,

590
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:49,680
they,

591
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,010
they,

592
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,780
they circumcised them with a stick.

593
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,831
Not only that,

594
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:57,570
they keep this for skin on and they tied
in a bow and they push the head of the

595
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:58,980
penis through this bow.

596
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,050
And this whole ritual takes several
weeks in which time they're secluded.

597
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:05,520
And when they leave the hut,

598
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,570
they're like secluded in this hut.

599
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,100
When they leave the hut to do anything,

600
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,360
they are not allowed to walk.

601
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:11,220
They must run at full pace.

602
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,850
It also involves crawling
through stinging nettles naked.

603
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,700
They have to crawl through
the stinging nettle bushes.

604
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:22,701
The idea is just to completely control
your ability to withstand pain.

605
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,950
I got to be tough bastard.

606
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,310
Oh yeah.

607
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,390
So it's fascinating.

608
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:29,430
It's like this perfect storm of,

609
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,950
they have a,

610
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,130
an innate natural athletic ability based
on their frame and then it's also the

611
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:39,240
running on a regular basis and then also
the intense ability to withstand pain.

612
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,070
Absolutely fascinating.

613
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:41,370
Fast

614
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:41,641
thanks.

615
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:42,241
Dot well again,

616
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:45,390
I mean this is all stuff in a culture
that we've kind of completely got away

617
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,620
from set behind us.

618
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:46,981
We don't,

619
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:50,710
we don't even interrelate
with that at all anymore.

620
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,100
And,

621
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,260
and it makes you wonder,

622
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:52,441
I mean,

623
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,780
if the shit hits the fan
and our culture goes down,

624
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,101
who can survive?

625
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:56,650
Actually,

626
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,130
I think we're just going to go back
to if the shit does hit the fan.

627
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,590
And I know that's a
huge topic of your work.

628
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:03,041
And what,

629
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,260
what brought me to you in
the first place was uh,

630
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:05,800
your,

631
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,660
your work on the very clear evidence that
at certain points in history this shit

632
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,630
clearly did hit the fan and
people did have to rebuild.

633
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,170
I watch a lot of shows on subsistence
living in mostly in Alaska.

634
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:20,740
There's a lot of these shows.

635
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,430
Um,

636
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,220
life below zero is my new favorite one.

637
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,070
And it's all based on
these people living this.

638
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,960
One of them is this man who lives with
this woman and they just fish and hunt

639
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:36,280
and their family lives off of this
and it's absolutely fascinating.

640
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,490
The every day is spent
acquiring food and they're not,

641
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,240
they're hardly growing
anything because it's so cold,

642
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:42,490
right?

643
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,560
So everything is just about catching fish,

644
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,730
hunting animals,

645
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,330
preserving these animals in whatever
way would they're drying or you know,

646
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,493
and it's,

647
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,750
it's an amazingly brutal life,

648
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,170
but they seem to be very happy.

649
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,200
And this is one of the really confusing
aspects of this real traditional sort of

650
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:06,301
[inaudible] subsistence living that
people seem to feel satisfied by it.

651
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,110
That's kind of something
we were meant to do.

652
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,040
Maybe in a way,

653
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,300
I don't know if it's meant to,

654
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,430
but it seems like we evolve to do it well.

655
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:14,870
You have to consider that for,

656
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,471
you know,

657
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:20,000
anatomically modern humans stars we know
have been around for slightly less than

658
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:23,390
200,000 years and for
almost all of that period,

659
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:24,290
that's what we did.

660
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,540
That's what we did
where we're just really,

661
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,411
as you know,

662
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:30,560
at least if we go with mainstream
history and certainly it's true for the

663
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:31,580
majority of the human race,

664
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:33,230
whether we go with
mainstream history or not,

665
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,460
it's really only in the last 10
12,000 years that we've been,

666
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,610
that we've been doing anything else
apart from hunting and gathering.

667
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,420
Yeah,

668
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,253
it's a,

669
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,270
it's a long,

670
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:43,330
long

671
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,250
time and we've tried to upset that
over the last 200 with machines

672
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,410
and electricity and all
these different things,

673
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:55,411
but we long for that created
a fundamentally a artificial
artificial way of life

674
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,740
and so quickly.

675
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah,

676
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,680
very rough.

677
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,630
It seems like our genetics have not
been able to catch up with the actual

678
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:02,464
environment,

679
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,423
but it was supported.

680
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,780
The,

681
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,170
the,

682
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,370
the irony of it is that this,

683
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,000
the oldest,

684
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,801
oldest development,

685
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,130
all this amazing technology,

686
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:10,000
all these machines,

687
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:10,691
all this gear,

688
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:11,524
all this equipment,

689
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,500
but somehow the promise was it would,

690
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,570
would make us happier and it didn't,

691
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,170
it didn't make us happier.

692
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,490
It made us,

693
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,930
it made us much less happy.

694
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,891
Yeah.

695
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,140
I don't know if that ever was the promise.

696
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:23,974
What was the problem?

697
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,491
I mean,

698
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:24,671
I,

699
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:25,031
you know,

700
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:25,540
I remember,

701
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,060
I remember with computers back in the
back in the 80s before computers really

702
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,380
early eighties late
seventies the idea was that,

703
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,010
you know,

704
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,490
if the computer came in that we would
just have all this endless Malaysia,

705
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,550
we would have a life
of complete relaxation.

706
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,630
There would be,

707
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,030
the problem would be
actually filling our leisure,

708
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,430
but that has not turned
out to be the case.

709
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,550
Everybody's lives are
taken up with the computer,

710
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:49,090
the,

711
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,781
the iPhone,

712
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:50,290
the,

713
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:50,801
the,

714
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:51,100
the,

715
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,030
the email,

716
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,511
you know,

717
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,380
all that all the time.

718
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:54,460
You could never get away from it.

719
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,650
It's just constantly dividing your time.

720
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,431
Emails,

721
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:57,851
hundreds,

722
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:58,181
hundreds,

723
00:21:58,181 --> 00:21:58,481
hundreds,

724
00:21:58,481 --> 00:21:59,410
hundreds of emails a day.

725
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,041
Sometimes.

726
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:00,230
I,

727
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,850
I have this huge burden of guilt
about emails that I don't answer,

728
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,170
which sit there in my,

729
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,000
in my email is I cannot answer them all.

730
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:07,870
It's impossible.

731
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,240
I gave up a few years ago
trying to answer them.

732
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,300
I try to respond to a few
tweets a day if possible,

733
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:13,870
but yeah,

734
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,980
while doing things,

735
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:19,030
especially providing as much content as
I do with podcasts and creating comedy,

736
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:19,510
all that,

737
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,500
there's no time for that.

738
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,150
You can't become a
fulltime letter right here.

739
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:22,540
Yeah,

740
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:22,870
it would.

741
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,180
That literally would be what you would do.

742
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,980
It would be any,

743
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,320
you would be dusk till dawn
doing that and then sleeping.

744
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,390
It's starting all over again and
you still would never catch up.

745
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:31,931
You'd never catch.

746
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:34,810
Especially if you gave
it a real honest reply,

747
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,750
like it was a complex discussion that
somebody one and a half with you,

748
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,250
you're not going to get there.

749
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,150
Yeah.

750
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,770
I faced the same problem
probably in a smaller,

751
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,820
a smaller level than you,

752
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,740
but you know like Facebook and Twitter,

753
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:45,041
Facebook,

754
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,240
Facebook I find is very,

755
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,230
it's a very useful thing.

756
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:47,680
It's a very,

757
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,491
very positive thing.

758
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:50,740
I do like interacting with
my Facebook community,

759
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,750
but I can't interact.

760
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,010
I can't interact that much.

761
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:54,521
I tried to,

762
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:55,540
I tried to put up posts,

763
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,860
I tried to put up new material.

764
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:58,300
People make interesting comments.

765
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,760
Sometimes those comments
are really valuable to me.

766
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,220
I get a link to something that
I didn't know about and I go,

767
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,113
go look at that.

768
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,820
But to respond to every
comment when you have,

769
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,200
when you have 300,

770
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:08,681
500,

771
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,514
a thousand,

772
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,900
1500 comments on a,

773
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:11,591
on a post,

774
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,341
it's impossible.

775
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:12,701
It's just,

776
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:14,440
it's just impossible to do that.

777
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,200
That is a weird thing about our time.

778
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,660
I think that's a stage
that we're going through.

779
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:20,494
There'll be,

780
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,710
I think whatever comes next will
probably be even crazier and even more

781
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,060
impossible to deal with
it halfway to telepathy.

782
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:28,281
Right.

783
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:28,440
And then,

784
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,200
yes,

785
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,040
that's what I think.

786
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,021
I think,

787
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:31,390
uh,

788
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,390
there'll be some sort of a technologically
created symbiotic relationship that

789
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:40,530
allows us to communicate some
symbiotic thing where I'm thinking,

790
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,020
I think we're already kind of symbiotic
with certain aspects of technology,

791
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,070
glasses and even glasses

792
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,150
are essentially a technology that's a
part of your life and wearing on your head

793
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:50,541
all day,

794
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:50,801
right?

795
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:50,930
Yeah.

796
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,500
I do.

797
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,490
Cell phone might mean it might as well
be attached to me because I'm scared.

798
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,420
If I leave it anywhere.

799
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,040
If I leave it in my car
and I go to the mall,

800
00:23:59,041 --> 00:23:59,271
I'm like,

801
00:23:59,271 --> 00:23:59,481
oh,

802
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,380
it's in the car.

803
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,043
I was alone.

804
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,040
Yeah.

805
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,680
We were.

806
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,810
These are weird times,

807
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,870
weird times when it comes
to this stage that we're in.

808
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:13,130
We're obviously progressing towards
an even greater connectivity with our

809
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:13,851
technology.

810
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,180
Yeah,

811
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,540
yeah,

812
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:14,721
yeah.

813
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,670
Which in some ways is a,

814
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:18,950
in some ways it is a
very good thing I have,

815
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,930
what I find again with,

816
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,220
with Facebook,

817
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:22,641
with the,

818
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:25,370
with the Internet is a,

819
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,860
suddenly the whole world is talking.

820
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,280
We're talking to each other and it
doesn't actually matter what national

821
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,810
boundaries you have or where you,

822
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,850
where you grew up,

823
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,120
what your religion is you're in,

824
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:37,030
you're in communication with people from,

825
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,480
from all over the world and communities
of ideas tend to kind of gravitate

826
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,770
together and people share,

827
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,790
share thoughts and ideas.

828
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,180
This is far as we know is
a new development for the
human race to do this on a

829
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,850
global scale and yeah,

830
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,900
some shit comes out of it,

831
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,960
but also also I think a lot of good
stuff is coming out of it and it is

832
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:54,794
challenging.

833
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,170
It is challenging the status
quo in the world today.

834
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:57,980
It is very,

835
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,730
it's very threatening to the powers that
be that people can communicate directly

836
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,564
with one another.

837
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:07,580
I remember a time as an author when I
depended heavily on the big media to to be

838
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:08,121
heard about,

839
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:08,954
to be known at all.

840
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,130
If I'd written a new book,

841
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,280
How could anybody know I'd written it
unless one of the big newspapers are a big

842
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,050
TV station or somebody covered it.

843
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,550
I don't give a shit about that now.

844
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:16,910
I don't.

845
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,440
I don't need those people anymore.

846
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,831
You know,

847
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:18,990
I,

848
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,670
I can communicate directly with
people who are interested in my,

849
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,870
and the big media companies or whoever
influenced them could remove a book towed

850
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:29,480
from the market and then that,

851
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,750
that subject is gone.

852
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:30,990
Yeah.

853
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,670
John Marco Legros book,

854
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,940
perfect examples of sacred
mushroom and the cross.

855
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,690
Fantastic book.

856
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:36,931
Yeah.

857
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:38,400
And if you've never read it,

858
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:43,401
John Marco leg was a biblical scholar
and a linguist to also happen to be an

859
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:44,550
ordained minister.

860
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:46,080
He was one of the guys who was,

861
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,101
he was,

862
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:47,251
uh,

863
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:50,400
assigned to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls,

864
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,820
did it for 14 years and
wrote this amazing book,

865
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,850
which basically said that the entire
religion of Christianity originally was

866
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:03,480
about consuming psychedelic
mushrooms and fertility rituals.

867
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,200
Yeah.

868
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,610
Fascinating stuff.

869
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,493
Yeah.

870
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,470
They removed it.

871
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:07,711
I mean,

872
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:08,640
that book was gone.

873
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,050
They didn't like the message at all.

874
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,321
Yeah.

875
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:11,340
Young urban has,

876
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,840
has worked to republish it and it's,

877
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:15,540
it's available again now.

878
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,270
But for the longest
time that book was gone.

879
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:18,991
You had to find,

880
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:23,910
I own two copies of it that I bought
used and they were very expensive.

881
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:25,140
You had to buy them from,

882
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:25,530
you know,

883
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,710
some strange book company that found them.

884
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,000
So this is something in the big,

885
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:30,511
big media,

886
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:31,150
can't do anything.

887
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,490
We'll do it.

888
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,730
And the interest they serve,

889
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,870
they cannot do it anymore.

890
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,470
You could find something tweeted,

891
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,900
so take a picture of it.

892
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,360
Say if you were in Turkey and
you found something unique,

893
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:40,560
you can take a picture of that,

894
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,710
tweet it and,

895
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:41,991
and,

896
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:42,261
and,

897
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:42,531
and,

898
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:44,430
and Lincoln article to your website.

899
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,240
Boom.

900
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,220
Put whatever you found on your website.

901
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:49,110
And then within moments,

902
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:49,320
yeah,

903
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,160
thousands of people would be downloading
it and trading it and it would just

904
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,290
frenzy spread across the world.

905
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,891
I've been doing that.

906
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,840
I'd be making a point on my travels of,

907
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,580
of putting up a picture and I'm putting
up my immediate reaction to something

908
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:03,031
that I've,

909
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,110
something that I've seen.

910
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,960
And it produces a lot of,

911
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,920
a lot of reaction.

912
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,191
And,

913
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:08,851
and again,

914
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:09,684
it's a,

915
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,081
you know,

916
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:10,471
it goes,

917
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:12,690
it goes two ways because when
people communicate with me,

918
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:13,530
I learned from them.

919
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,610
It's not just that I'm giving,

920
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,481
I'm giving people,

921
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:18,390
so I'm getting stuff back all the
time and I appreciate that my,

922
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:19,224
I think my,

923
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,110
I have these conversations with people
that I meet at shows all the time,

924
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:22,650
will they'll say,

925
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:22,831
oh,

926
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:23,270
this pot,

927
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,290
the podcasts changed my
life and thank you so much.

928
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,180
It changed my life too and my interaction
with these people as changed my life

929
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,710
as much as it's changed their life.

930
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,381
The,

931
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:32,611
the,

932
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:32,821
the,

933
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:37,350
the information that I get on a daily
basis from people on Twitter in informs me

934
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:39,540
in a way that I've never
been informed before.

935
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,490
Constant all day long.

936
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,470
I mean every day I'm getting all these
new stories that are tweeted to me and I

937
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,540
retweet the fascinating
ones as much as I can,

938
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,280
but it's a never ending stream.

939
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,511
It's amazing.

940
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:52,021
I love it.

941
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:52,854
I'm so,

942
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,060
I'm so indebted.

943
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:55,020
I'm so happy.

944
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,220
I feel so obligated.

945
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:56,581
The whole,

946
00:27:56,581 --> 00:28:00,270
the whole connection is a very
rewarding connection for me as well.

947
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:00,991
As a matter of fact,

948
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:02,490
you are doing something quite special.

949
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:02,800
I mean,

950
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,070
I've been on the road and,

951
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,240
and it's amazing the people that I meet,

952
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:07,290
whether it's in South Africa,

953
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,690
whether it's in some
Midland city in Britain,

954
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:11,130
whether it's in upstate New York,

955
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:11,401
you know,

956
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,570
who'd listen to Joe Rogan.

957
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,410
Um,

958
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,460
you're reaching a lot of,

959
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,600
a lot of people that way.

960
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,590
And uh,

961
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,930
this is special and it's eyeopening.

962
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:19,681
Well,

963
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,510
it's an amazing connection that we have.

964
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:21,910
It's in a,

965
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,230
it's amazing to be able to do what
we're doing and it's a new thing.

966
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,501
I mean,

967
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:25,671
it's,

968
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:26,040
it just,

969
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,270
it never happened before.

970
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,100
It wasn't around this way.

971
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,770
It's possible to change the world.

972
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,970
Everybody says no,

973
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:34,020
the world is too big.

974
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,000
The power structures to great,

975
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,751
nothing can be,

976
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:37,531
nothing can be changed.

977
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:37,771
Nothing.

978
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,401
But it can be able to,

979
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:39,121
but I don't think so.

980
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:40,170
I'm really optimistic,

981
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,560
I think.

982
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,090
I think good things are good.

983
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:42,781
Things are coming.

984
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:43,890
There's an awakening going on.

985
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,760
I am as well.

986
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,610
I'm very optimistic just based on the
people that I've met that have told me

987
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:48,360
they've changed their life.

988
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,193
I have met no,

989
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,041
no bullshit.

990
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:54,180
At least 30 or 40 people that told
me they lost a hundred pounds if they

991
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:55,230
listened to this podcast.

992
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,310
That's incredible.

993
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,100
Just people that just change their diet,

994
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,290
started to exercising and started
getting their blood pumping and feeling

995
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:01,651
better.

996
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:06,510
It started thinking positively
cause surrounding themselves
with positive people

997
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,810
and that if that could
be done on that scale,

998
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,580
that can spread virally.

999
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,660
That's totally can.

1000
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:14,880
And that's a real measurable
change in somebody's life.

1001
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:15,180
That's,

1002
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,380
that's setting aside ill
health and discomfort and
moving onto something better

1003
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:20,040
and more positive.

1004
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,870
And I've talked to maybe 50 or so people
that have started their own podcast

1005
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:27,120
because of this podcast and I,

1006
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,780
I'm hugely encouraging of that
because I think there's no difference.

1007
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:31,021
I mean,

1008
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,280
if you're a curious person,

1009
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:35,430
you speak a language that other people
understand and you find information

1010
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:35,730
online,

1011
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,563
you want to discuss it,

1012
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,830
start a fucking podcast.

1013
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:38,664
Why not?

1014
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:38,881
I mean,

1015
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:38,941
if,

1016
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:39,920
if it catches on,

1017
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:41,560
it catches on and if it doesn't catch on,

1018
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,010
keep

1019
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,420
going until it does catch on.

1020
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,290
The way I see it though,

1021
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:44,711
it's really,

1022
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:46,060
it's really interesting looking at,

1023
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,200
at your story.

1024
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,651
Okay.

1025
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:48,040
I mean,

1026
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,750
so you've got this fight,

1027
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,181
this fight,

1028
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:51,130
her background,

1029
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,150
MMA,

1030
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,370
I don't know a lot about if it
stands for mixed martial arts,

1031
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:58,630
UFC ultimate fighting championship
to bit fighting championship.

1032
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,840
And that goes back into
your youth a long way.

1033
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,230
I saw it,

1034
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,260
I saw a little clip of
you just kicking somebody.

1035
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,700
I dunno so fast.

1036
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,271
You didn't,

1037
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:07,780
you looked,

1038
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,301
it was a,

1039
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:09,670
it was incredible to see that.

1040
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,110
So you've got all of that and,

1041
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,700
and I meet a lot of people who are,

1042
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,870
who are interested in that.

1043
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:14,471
My son in law,

1044
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:14,981
for example,

1045
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:15,191
is a,

1046
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:16,900
is a mixed martial arts
fighter and they really,

1047
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:18,190
hugely important part of his life.

1048
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,280
But at the same time you're combining
it with this extraordinary interest in

1049
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:23,640
psychedelics and social change and,

1050
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:25,450
and all of these radical ideas.

1051
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:29,320
And intuitively one would not immediately
think that somebody who's into mixed,

1052
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,460
mixed martial arts fighting would be
also into radical philosophical ideas.

1053
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:37,220
But it's the precisely the combination
of those two things that is a,

1054
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,530
that is really attractive I think.

1055
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,771
Well,

1056
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:43,660
I think that the intuition or intuitively
that it wouldn't be is just because

1057
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:45,550
people don't understand what
martial arts really are.

1058
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:45,940
Right?

1059
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,950
In martial art with a
martial art really is,

1060
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:49,110
is the,

1061
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,140
the the path that you go through in
becoming excellent in a martial art,

1062
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,290
it's just developing your human potential.

1063
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,980
That's all it is and and seeking the
truth about yourself and your own

1064
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:00,700
character.

1065
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,020
Like as we were talking about those Kenyan
men who endure extreme pain and they

1066
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:07,300
become stronger because of that,

1067
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,190
they become something
special because of that,

1068
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,600
that seeking truth
through martial arts is,

1069
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,740
it's along the same lines.

1070
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:19,741
It's doing something incredibly difficult
and in doing that you grow as a person

1071
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,200
and then in seeking that
truth about your character,

1072
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,180
seeking the truth about
your determination,

1073
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:26,080
your willpower,

1074
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:26,801
your focus,

1075
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,634
your discipline,

1076
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,780
you also start to seek truth in everything
else around you and your government

1077
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,470
and your relationships and your all,

1078
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,190
all various aspects of your life,

1079
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:36,881
your diet.

1080
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:39,760
You see the relationship between your
diet and your health and all these

1081
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:42,140
different things they do fall into.

1082
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,800
They do psychedelics,

1083
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,351
all of them.

1084
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:44,881
Psychedelics.

1085
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:49,050
Absolutely because it because in in
many ways there is no more challenging

1086
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,060
adventure or experience that one can have.

1087
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:51,271
I mean,

1088
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:51,451
yeah,

1089
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,310
there's all kinds of wilderness
experiences weren't going to have,

1090
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:57,180
but a deep journey with a powerful
psychedelic is going to challenge you in

1091
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:01,260
every possible level as a human being
and it requires incredible will and

1092
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:02,100
strength to,

1093
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:02,671
to deal with it.

1094
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,610
This is what a lot of people who don't
work with psychedelics who had just

1095
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:08,550
washed brainwashed by the whole war
on drugs thing don't understand.

1096
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:08,971
This is a,

1097
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:13,440
this is a deep personal journey which
requires strength of character to fulfill.

1098
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,460
Without a doubt.

1099
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,840
I've done some terrifying
things in my life,

1100
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,730
but the moment before you,

1101
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,740
you light the lighter that fires up
the DMT is one of the most terrifying

1102
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,670
moments of all time.

1103
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:25,510
I totally agree.

1104
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,090
Especially if you've been there and
you know what's coming and you're like,

1105
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:29,050
Whoa,

1106
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:29,980
here we go.

1107
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,330
15 minutes in a rocket to
the center of the universe,

1108
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:39,331
exact swarming with colors and
geometric patterns and truth and fear

1109
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,913
and entities.

1110
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,610
Yeah,

1111
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:42,771
I,

1112
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:43,210
I,

1113
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,240
I share that.

1114
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:44,421
I mean,

1115
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,141
the last time I,

1116
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:50,030
the last time I smoked DMT was in up to
the beginning of the end of September,

1117
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,500
2011 I haven't smoked since because,

1118
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,071
and I will.

1119
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:52,760
But I had,

1120
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,870
I had such a,

1121
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,190
such a,

1122
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,020
well at the word terrifying.

1123
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,970
It doesn't do it justice
to what happened to me.

1124
00:32:58,971 --> 00:32:59,720
It was,

1125
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,650
it was just the,

1126
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,730
the single hugest ordeal that I
have ever confronted in my life.

1127
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:06,740
And after you've been
through an ordeal like that,

1128
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,023
you kind of,

1129
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,580
you kind of think twice
about just leaping,

1130
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,810
leaping back into it again.

1131
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:13,160
But I learned a lot from it.

1132
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:13,521
It was,

1133
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:14,450
it was a hugely,

1134
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:17,540
hugely beneficial and to survive
that and to come back from it,

1135
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,351
you know,

1136
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:18,621
you,

1137
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,780
you gather your strength
from experiences like that.

1138
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:21,381
And that's why I,

1139
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:26,381
that's why I think our society is foolish
to try to just sanitize everything and

1140
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:27,800
not allow people to,

1141
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,280
to,

1142
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,360
to undergo these,

1143
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,550
these profound and important experiences.

1144
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,910
We'd rather we should be
creating structures where
it is possible for people to

1145
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:38,870
have those experiences and where they
don't need to feel afraid of the law about

1146
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:39,704
it and where they,

1147
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:43,370
where they can challenge themselves in
that way with good advice and with and

1148
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,920
with wise and loving care
surrounding that situation.

1149
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,701
Absolutely.

1150
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:50,360
And I think that's one of
the things that's beautiful
about today's internet and

1151
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,530
these exchanges like we're having right
now is it lets people know what these

1152
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:57,260
experiences really are about and what,

1153
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,200
what the potential these
experiences actually do hold.

1154
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,340
Because we're the victim of massive
propaganda that has been going on for

1155
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:07,610
decades and decades and
it's thousands of years.

1156
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,331
It's confused.

1157
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:10,010
Some really intelligent people.

1158
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:13,880
I've had some really disappointing
conversations with guys like Michio Kaku,

1159
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,480
you know,

1160
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,500
talking about mushrooms,

1161
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:16,610
giving you brain damage,

1162
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,153
such shit.

1163
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,940
It's just so silly complete.

1164
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,140
It's such a brilliant man.

1165
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:26,140
Otherwise it's like the brainwashing
goes very deep and it's as though it,

1166
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,670
it presses a button in certain certain
people that they actually just rational

1167
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:33,920
faculties shutdown and they cannot,

1168
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,700
they cannot react to the subject
in an intelligent way anymore.

1169
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,031
I do.

1170
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:39,470
I do find this again and again.

1171
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,521
It is a,

1172
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:41,450
it is a,

1173
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:42,500
it is a huge problem.

1174
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,010
It's a self preservation issue as well
for people that are professionals.

1175
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:48,000
Because if you're a
professional in any sort of,

1176
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:48,500
uh,

1177
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,320
anything where you're being judged or
you're being looked at as you know,

1178
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,120
possibly,

1179
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,451
oh,

1180
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:53,661
you know,

1181
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,340
we're looking at you
for possible promotion,

1182
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:55,970
but we heard your,

1183
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:56,511
what are you doing?

1184
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,860
Mushrooms and the desert.

1185
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,270
What the Fuck Bob,

1186
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,340
you're ruining the whole career pal.

1187
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,760
You know,

1188
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,870
you're on the fast track.

1189
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,290
Yeah,

1190
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:03,771
exactly.

1191
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:04,071
People,

1192
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:04,630
people are,

1193
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,810
are,

1194
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,010
are in danger of destroying
their careers if that,

1195
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:07,760
if that comes out.

1196
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,220
I mean that's where I
guess you and I have some,

1197
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,830
some advantage because we,

1198
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,440
we have careers that cannot get
really in doing that can only help.

1199
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:16,970
Yeah.

1200
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,160
If I get caught with a bag
of mushrooms at the airport,

1201
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:19,994
I got a bump.

1202
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,040
Everything is great.

1203
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,480
Right,

1204
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:22,700
right.

1205
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,533
We get excited.

1206
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,770
My Twitter explodes.

1207
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,540
Yeah.

1208
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,120
I mean,

1209
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,530
obviously I'm not flying with mushrooms,

1210
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:28,760
but my point being that,

1211
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:29,210
yeah,

1212
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,470
and if you're honest about it,

1213
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,370
look,

1214
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,550
if you're doing something you shouldn't
be doing because it's harming someone

1215
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,560
and people find out about it,

1216
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,940
the repercussions are
real and they should be.

1217
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,210
Yeah,

1218
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,510
but if you're doing something like
psychedelics that harm no one and they're

1219
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:43,050
actually,

1220
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,040
and then you can have a
rational discussion about
the benefits that you've had

1221
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,600
from them that helps people.

1222
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,463
It really does.

1223
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,390
Totally helps people.

1224
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,941
I find this,

1225
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,970
I find this again and again and
that's the crucial distinction is,

1226
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,620
is are you doing something
which is harmful to others,

1227
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:00,630
which impinges upon the
sovereignty of others,

1228
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:03,750
which makes the life of another
person less rather than more.

1229
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,460
And the answer is we'd
taking psychedelics.

1230
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:05,790
No,

1231
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,623
you're not right.

1232
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,261
You're not doing that.

1233
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:09,240
That's an inner experience
that that's your,

1234
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,260
that's your own experience.

1235
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,430
As I've said many times,

1236
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:11,890
I mean we all,

1237
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:16,590
we have plenty of laws that deal with
doing negative stuff too to other people.

1238
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,740
We do not need laws that seek to govern,

1239
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:20,610
control,

1240
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,623
manage,

1241
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,850
limit our consciousness.

1242
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,631
This is the,

1243
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:28,710
this is the heart of the matter we're
starting to see in our lifetime these

1244
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:30,540
centers in Mexico.

1245
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:35,100
My friend Ed clay runs one in Mexico and
I know there's some in Canada as well,

1246
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:40,080
where they have these Ibogaine centers
where people are going and completely

1247
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,390
curing themselves from opiates.

1248
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,850
Opiate addictions for folks who don't
know are a huge problem in this country.

1249
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,980
I have lost a couple of friendships.

1250
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:50,431
One,

1251
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:54,810
it went horribly wrong because I know
the guy was on a bunch of different pills

1252
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:57,420
from a bunch of different doctors and
I just couldn't deal with them anymore.

1253
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,990
I had to get up out of my life blaming
other people for all of its failures

1254
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:01,501
constantly.

1255
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:05,970
Woe is me and just on pills all the
time and things have prescribed pills.

1256
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,740
These are illegal pills.

1257
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,640
He had a back injury and he went to one
doctor in one state and then moved to

1258
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:13,440
California and started
going to another doctor.

1259
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,430
And then having both guys
sending prescriptions and
taking both two times the

1260
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:18,264
amount of pills.

1261
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,260
And if you would take,

1262
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,800
you take a prescribed
dose of opiate pills,

1263
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,570
you're very likely to get addictive.

1264
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,020
Yeah.

1265
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,310
Even with the prescribed dosage,

1266
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,240
she'll really difficult
time to get off of them,

1267
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,750
especially if you're facing
some significant pain.

1268
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:31,440
Yeah.

1269
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,790
You just had a hip replacement.

1270
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,140
Did they prescribe you any?

1271
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:34,291
Yeah,

1272
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:34,920
they did.

1273
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,460
Um,

1274
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,750
I was given but nothing,

1275
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:36,991
I mean,

1276
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:38,130
nothing extremely strong,

1277
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,360
but codene you know,

1278
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:39,691
which is,

1279
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,524
which is an opiate,

1280
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,350
like,

1281
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,020
well that's what Nyquil used to have it,

1282
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:43,350
right?

1283
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:43,651
It does.

1284
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:43,921
It does.

1285
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:44,731
It I used to.

1286
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:45,481
I believe so.

1287
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:46,770
I believe Nyquil had coding.

1288
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,041
I mean,

1289
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,200
coding is actually a
highly addictive drug.

1290
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:49,560
It's a,

1291
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,010
there's no,

1292
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,030
there's no doubt it is,

1293
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:51,960
it is addictive.

1294
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,531
In Britain.

1295
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:54,660
David often mix it with paracetamol,

1296
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:55,170
which is a,

1297
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,120
which is a less strong pain killer.

1298
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,781
And,

1299
00:37:57,781 --> 00:37:58,010
uh,

1300
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,860
if you take those,

1301
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,750
those two pills in combination,

1302
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,990
you could get addicted to
it within a week or 10 days.

1303
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,620
Um,

1304
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,510
and it's the coding that
you're getting addicted to,

1305
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,010
but it's the paracetamol that's really
good to totally screw up your liver,

1306
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:11,550
you know,

1307
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,070
um,

1308
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,431
in the,

1309
00:38:12,431 --> 00:38:12,931
in the,

1310
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:13,710
in the long run.

1311
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:13,950
And,

1312
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,500
and it's,

1313
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,010
it's stunning actually that the,

1314
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,020
the big pharmaceutical companies
are allowed to do this.

1315
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:23,880
They're allowed to get to deliberately
addict people to Hook people on very

1316
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:25,980
powerful drugs that I
really have very little,

1317
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,450
very little benefit.

1318
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,201
I mean,

1319
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:29,010
if I,

1320
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,461
to be honest,

1321
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:29,791
if I,

1322
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:30,624
if I had some,

1323
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,950
some terrible cancer,

1324
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,000
some terrible pain,

1325
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:34,530
some terrible suffering,

1326
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,720
I would be very interested
in exploring opium or,

1327
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,860
or even heroin.

1328
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,671
As a matter of fact,

1329
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:40,510
I think that nature,

1330
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,070
nature has been kind to us.

1331
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:45,820
It's provided us with certain plants
that can help us with pain and,

1332
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,110
and the reaches a stage,

1333
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,540
it may reach a stage in life where,

1334
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:48,940
where you're,

1335
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,390
where your,

1336
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,171
where your terminal,

1337
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:50,420
where,

1338
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,400
why suffer that,

1339
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,020
why suffered that terrible agony.

1340
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:53,860
Um,

1341
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,431
it would be,

1342
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:56,010
it would be interesting perhaps to,

1343
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,610
to,

1344
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,480
to sort of bliss out a bit on that,

1345
00:38:58,481 --> 00:38:59,740
but to take it regularly,

1346
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:01,780
daily for Small and minor pain,

1347
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:02,680
this is a huge mistake.

1348
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,550
It's not what it's for.

1349
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,540
There's a new,

1350
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:09,541
a snail toxin that they've discovered
that is a hundred times more effective

1351
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,400
than opiates and his non addictive.

1352
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:13,990
Oh Wow.

1353
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,090
And they're trying to figure out a way.

1354
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:16,924
There's a,

1355
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,980
there's a new drug is from the cone
snail venom and it's a hundred times more

1356
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:27,760
potent than any existing pain
medication and completely nonaddictive.

1357
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,170
And they're,

1358
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,580
they're coming up with this nail venom
in a pill form that would just completely

1359
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,510
eliminate pain.

1360
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,731
I can see the,

1361
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:37,180
um,

1362
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,190
the big drug companies
not wanting to do that.

1363
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,570
They'll probably run out with a hammer
and smash every snail that exists.

1364
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,433
Lash

1365
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,050
get in cahoots with some,

1366
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,610
some company to spray some shit all over
the areas where these nails live and

1367
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:52,421
just whack them out.

1368
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:53,980
All they wanted to keep us,

1369
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:55,180
they want to keep us addicted.

1370
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:55,331
Well,

1371
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:56,260
the amount of money,

1372
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:56,770
I mean,

1373
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,420
people would say that
that's a ridiculous thing.

1374
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:58,660
No,

1375
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,890
that's not what people do.

1376
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:03,930
But the amount of money you're talking
about is absolutely staggering.

1377
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,900
Cost an enormous billions
upon billions every month.

1378
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:08,630
Yeah.

1379
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,280
Yeah.

1380
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,990
And you were talking about about opiate
addictions of which the vast majority

1381
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:17,000
are addictions to prescribed pills and,

1382
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,690
but,

1383
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,790
but then there's also,

1384
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,630
there's also heroin,

1385
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,650
heroin addiction.

1386
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,311
And again,

1387
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:22,120
if again,

1388
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,630
um,

1389
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,630
and in fact Iowasca astonishingly
successful in getting people off these off

1390
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:29,000
these addictions,

1391
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,380
a very weird way,

1392
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,150
very weird way.

1393
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,470
Um,

1394
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:31,620
I,

1395
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:31,931
I'm,

1396
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,590
I'm not sure the exact mechanism Ibogaine,

1397
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,911
but I,

1398
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:39,911
the people that have taken it if told
me that it's both physically removed,

1399
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:46,591
the addiction and more
importantly psychologically
alerts you to all the factors

1400
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:51,490
that have contributed to your shitty
decision making in the first place.

1401
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,000
That's it.

1402
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,331
That's it.

1403
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:52,660
Exactly.

1404
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,610
All the Evers in your thinking,

1405
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:58,180
all the errors in your personality that
have led you to this path and you're

1406
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:01,270
just trying to numb life with these pills.

1407
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,300
It's like a,

1408
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,010
it's like a teaching that you get and
that's the mystery of these plants

1409
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,110
actually have th th the teacher plants,

1410
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:12,330
particularly the two plants that go into
the Iowasca brew and then they Boca,

1411
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,410
uh,

1412
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,240
they're probably the
most powerful in this,

1413
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,110
in this respect,

1414
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:21,340
is that there is that there's a sense
of an encounter with an intelligence

1415
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,240
which,

1416
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,710
which communicates with you at which
gets right to the root of your personal

1417
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:27,544
issue.

1418
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,061
Uh,

1419
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:28,351
and,

1420
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:29,950
and shows it to you and says,

1421
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:30,610
well,

1422
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,091
I mean,

1423
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:33,830
I've had some experience with this
myself and shows to you and says,

1424
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,070
this

1425
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,240
is actually how you are,

1426
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:35,930
you know,

1427
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,763
and you think,

1428
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:37,701
fuck,

1429
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:38,690
I never realized that.

1430
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:38,991
Really.

1431
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:39,380
I,

1432
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,690
I hid that from myself for so long.

1433
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,553
The Ego,

1434
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,960
the ego and that revelation
is extremely helpful in,

1435
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:50,970
in handling an addiction and no ones
protecting you by making Ibogaine,

1436
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,741
illegal,

1437
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:55,850
no ones protecting you from anything
other than you getting cured from these

1438
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:56,870
illnesses and,

1439
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:01,550
and realizing the issues that you have
in your life and in your personality.

1440
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:05,840
And you can see yet another example of
the fact that we live in a society that

1441
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:07,460
is completely insane.

1442
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,760
Our society at is actually crazy.

1443
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,841
It's crazy.

1444
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:16,841
It's run by crazy people in pursuit
of crazy motives and it is designed to

1445
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,370
diminish you and potential.

1446
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:19,881
I can't help,

1447
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:20,720
I don't think it's accident.

1448
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,960
I think it's actually deliberately
designed to minimize you by who?

1449
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:24,771
Well,

1450
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:27,470
I mean this is where I have to get
into something like Gnosticism,

1451
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,760
which has been a long term,

1452
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,320
a long term interest of mine.

1453
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,030
And the idea that there is a,

1454
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,650
I don't want to use the word divine
in terms of God cause I don't go with,

1455
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,040
with,

1456
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,560
with God particularly
I do go with mystery,

1457
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,700
but that there's a divine spark in,

1458
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:43,400
in human beings and,

1459
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:48,350
and that there has been a project
for thousands of years to deny us the

1460
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:51,290
opportunity to realize
that part of ourselves,

1461
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:55,610
the spiritual essence of ourselves and
to keep us chained in matter and locked

1462
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:55,850
in,

1463
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,290
locked in the material realm.

1464
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:57,990
And,

1465
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,000
and what we see in modern society
is two things going on side by side.

1466
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:04,700
One is so called the materialist science,

1467
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,350
which tells us that there is nothing
else to reality except the stuff that you

1468
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:14,060
can weigh and measure and count and
any thought that there might be spirit,

1469
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:14,360
uh,

1470
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,141
that consciousness,

1471
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:15,681
for example,

1472
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:18,050
might not be a generated by the brain,

1473
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:19,280
might not be local to the brain.

1474
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,460
Any such thought is supposed to be
according to materialist science,

1475
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:23,240
complete nonsense.

1476
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,210
And then there's the
actual materialism which,

1477
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,240
which tries to persuade us through all
manner of media and the way our society

1478
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:31,641
is run,

1479
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:36,320
that our sole purpose as creatures is to
produce and consume and that we have no

1480
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:40,190
other function here on this planet and
that we are to define ourselves and

1481
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:44,030
measure ourselves in terms of
our production and consumption.

1482
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,570
Is that a really what we're being taught
or is that just something that people

1483
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:48,770
find easy,

1484
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,760
that that producing and
consuming is just easy.

1485
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:53,870
It's exciting.

1486
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,771
Get a new car.

1487
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:55,521
It's exciting.

1488
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:58,970
Get a new TV that's exciting work and you,

1489
00:43:58,971 --> 00:43:59,301
you know,

1490
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:01,190
you can wear clothes
that this guy can't wear.

1491
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:01,431
Ooh,

1492
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,264
exciting.

1493
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,300
I think there's something to that that
is just a natural aspect of being a human

1494
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:12,671
being and constantly having this
desire for improvement and progress.

1495
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,730
And we measure that improvement and
progress erroneously with objects.

1496
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:17,811
I mean,

1497
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:18,291
there was a,

1498
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:19,480
there was a culture of,

1499
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:19,651
uh,

1500
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:20,900
of native American Indians,

1501
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:21,710
I forget the,

1502
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,640
I forget the name of the tribe who had
this ceremony called the potlatch where

1503
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:25,940
the PR,

1504
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,200
which happened like once a year and
their project that what they had to do as

1505
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:29,400
the,

1506
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,190
the more things you could burn that

1507
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,670
showed,

1508
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,740
that showed that you
were a really big guy.

1509
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:35,450
You know,

1510
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:35,760
he just,

1511
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,090
just complete the ultimate conspicuous
consumption as you take all these

1512
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:40,530
possessions and burn them.

1513
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,150
Not because you're despising them,

1514
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:44,310
but because you're rich
enough to just barely,

1515
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,031
oh,

1516
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:45,841
that's so stupid.

1517
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:47,700
I thought it was to
free yourself from this.

1518
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:49,020
Now unfortunately not,

1519
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,430
unfortunately not.

1520
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,421
Yeah.

1521
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:51,840
The,

1522
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,940
the consciousness not being,

1523
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,793
uh,

1524
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,520
projected from the human mind is a very
confusing one to me because I see their

1525
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:01,050
point and I see your point.

1526
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:01,861
I see,

1527
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:02,694
I see.

1528
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,740
What I see is I don't think that
we know enough about consciousness.

1529
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:11,070
It's excel itself to
define what's going on.

1530
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:11,904
We can't be sure.

1531
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,930
I think it is possible that the
mind could be some form of antenna.

1532
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,520
I don't know that,

1533
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,170
I think it's pretty clear that if
you injure certain parts of the mind,

1534
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:25,170
it affects certain aspects
of cognitive function.

1535
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,250
I think that's pretty clear.

1536
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:26,940
It's pretty clear.

1537
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,773
Yeah,

1538
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,411
that's true.

1539
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:30,480
And an antenna to the damage,

1540
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,710
if you damage an antenna,

1541
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:33,600
the picture on the TV screen is affected.

1542
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,300
Exactly.

1543
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,460
Fuck up a radio,

1544
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,630
the insides of a radio.

1545
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:37,321
It doesn't mean that the,

1546
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:38,850
the signal's not still out there.

1547
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:39,180
Yeah.

1548
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,170
It's just not getting in.

1549
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:40,441
Right.

1550
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:40,700
Yeah.

1551
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,100
Yeah.

1552
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,933
There's that.

1553
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,380
And there's also,

1554
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,850
there was a fascinating debate recently
between a Richard Dawkins and Deepak

1555
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:48,684
Chopra,

1556
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,111
which,

1557
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:49,944
uh,

1558
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:50,701
it was,

1559
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:54,600
it was quite hilarious cause Richard
Dawkins is a very brilliant guy.

1560
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,170
He,

1561
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:55,710
he's,

1562
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,270
he's also kind of cunty.

1563
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,890
He gets a little conti,

1564
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,321
rightly so.

1565
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:01,561
I mean,

1566
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:01,760
he's,

1567
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,890
he's had to deal with so much
quackery and fuckery his whole life.

1568
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:05,401
And he's been,

1569
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:05,920
you know,

1570
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,060
uh,

1571
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,370
of rabid atheists atheist for the longest.

1572
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,540
He's made a career out of that,

1573
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,400
has made a big career out of that.

1574
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,170
But one of the things that Deepak said
that was really fascinating because they

1575
00:46:15,171 --> 00:46:18,300
were talking about consciousness
and consciousness being an Adams and

1576
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:19,200
consciousness being in,

1577
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:24,420
and Dawkins was insisting that these
things did not have consciousness,

1578
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,890
which to me is,

1579
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:26,701
oh,

1580
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,151
I go,

1581
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:27,271
I,

1582
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:28,530
how can you insist?

1583
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:29,850
It seems to me.

1584
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,151
Yeah,

1585
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:30,984
it seems to me that,

1586
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,540
but whether you clearly you're,

1587
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,830
he's a brilliant man with a massive
amount of scientific data at his disposal

1588
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,720
for things that he can prove for sure.

1589
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,460
But to say that you know,

1590
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:46,461
that Adam's don't have consciousness
is kind of silly because we don't,

1591
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,970
and the other thing that Deepak said
that I thought was really fascinating was

1592
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:56,150
that he believes that what w what
you're seeing in human beings with human

1593
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,650
beings being recycled star dust me,

1594
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:01,030
we literally are made of star dust.

1595
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,130
A star had to explode to create the very
molecules that are inside of our body

1596
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,540
and what you're seeing in the human
being is the universe actually becoming

1597
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:12,180
aware of itself in a way
that it can communicate.

1598
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,230
I think that's a beautiful idea.

1599
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:18,260
It's a beautiful idea and I think both
guys are so rigid on what their side is,

1600
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:19,381
you know,

1601
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,191
and especially in the,

1602
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:22,770
in a debate forum and Dawkins absolutely,

1603
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:23,830
sure he's correct.

1604
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:28,680
Depok confusing the fuck out of everybody
with word salad of quantum and this

1605
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:29,080
and that.

1606
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,670
He just throws quantum out there.

1607
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:32,200
Like you throw salt on French fries,

1608
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,530
right?

1609
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,420
I don't even know if it's
the right way to use it,

1610
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:37,720
but he just throws it out there
and confuses the shit out of you.

1611
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:42,721
Sometimes like very poor method of
communication he incorporates because it's

1612
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:46,570
not clear what he's saying.

1613
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,030
Even though I know what quantum means.

1614
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:49,601
I know,

1615
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:52,450
I know what he's talking about when
he's talking about consciousness being

1616
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:53,230
nonlocal.

1617
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,280
I understand all those things,

1618
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:58,000
but he says it in such a word
salad way that it's like,

1619
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:58,501
what?

1620
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:58,650
Oh,

1621
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,100
I don't know what you're getting at.

1622
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:03,160
Man seems to me like you're trying to
confuse the shit out of people with a real

1623
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:04,330
elaborate sentence.

1624
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:05,743
Could be,

1625
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,680
and then when this
debate or make it clear,

1626
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:09,510
make a point.

1627
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,780
That's our goal to win

1628
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,211
bait.

1629
00:48:11,211 --> 00:48:12,090
Would Richard Dawkins,

1630
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,100
Richard Dawkins is a very clever guy.

1631
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:14,341
I,

1632
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:14,641
I've,

1633
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,930
I've met him and he's um,

1634
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,330
he's a formidable uh,

1635
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,000
arguing.

1636
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,660
Yes.

1637
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,350
It's not easy.

1638
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,161
Not Easy at all,

1639
00:48:20,161 --> 00:48:23,730
but he is a religious
fanatic in his own way.

1640
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,001
His,

1641
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:24,301
his,

1642
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:28,830
his non belief in the meaning or purpose
in the universe is a religious idea of

1643
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:29,580
a kind.

1644
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,660
It's not based on facts.

1645
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:31,710
It's not based on evidence.

1646
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:33,660
It's based on his,

1647
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:34,950
his opinion.

1648
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:35,611
As a matter of fact,

1649
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:36,444
nothing more.

1650
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:36,671
Well,

1651
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:38,770
it's also based on a lack of information.

1652
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:40,510
And when I say that lack of information,

1653
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:43,540
I mean one thing and one thing
only psychedelic experiences.

1654
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,800
He has not had them.

1655
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:46,450
He needs to have them without a doubt.

1656
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:47,380
You need to have the million.

1657
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,323
I would like to,

1658
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:51,150
I would like Dawkins to smoke DMT.

1659
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:51,900
Yes.

1660
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,770
That's the one.

1661
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,950
That's the one psychedelic with
which there is just no negotiation.

1662
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,370
You don't,

1663
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,620
you just don't get a discussion with DMT.

1664
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,200
It just does for you.

1665
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:01,561
And,

1666
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:04,200
and the other ones that
even the DMT in Iowa,

1667
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,180
Asca Dawkins could resist that,

1668
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,680
but the smoke DMT,

1669
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:08,910
once you hit the right dose,

1670
00:49:08,911 --> 00:49:10,320
once you pass that fourth,

1671
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,470
fourth big draw on the pipe there,

1672
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,030
then there is no negotiation.

1673
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:17,700
It is going to take you there
and it's going to deal with you.

1674
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:17,941
And,

1675
00:49:17,941 --> 00:49:20,220
and I would like to see
Dawkins argue with DMT.

1676
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,433
You can't,

1677
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:21,740
um,

1678
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,240
he would probably argue with what the
effects are and that it's some sort of a,

1679
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:26,750
uh,

1680
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,610
an assault on the sort of visual Cortex
by various chemicals that distort

1681
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:32,870
perception and reality.

1682
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,681
That's what he'd do.

1683
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:33,920
Yeah.

1684
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,191
Yeah.

1685
00:49:34,191 --> 00:49:34,850
I mean,

1686
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,880
what it is though is data and what it is,

1687
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:42,590
is an experience and it's both things
he's lacking in and he's lacking in that

1688
00:49:42,591 --> 00:49:43,041
data.

1689
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:43,470
And the,

1690
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,880
that experience data that he
needs to have as a scientist is,

1691
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,700
he's one of the,

1692
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,040
one of the people I would
really like to see having that,

1693
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:50,933
having that data.

1694
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,540
I agree with you that he would probably
find a way to rationalize it and put it

1695
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:55,470
and set it aside,

1696
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:59,640
but still it would be incredibly useful
for him to have that experience because

1697
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:04,641
he's been so influential in persuading
so many people that there is nothing

1698
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:08,850
beyond this material realm and DMT is
a place beyond this material realm.

1699
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,690
I am prepared to admit it could be
something that we're projecting out of our

1700
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:13,201
own minds.

1701
00:50:13,201 --> 00:50:14,330
It may not be any relative to,

1702
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,990
but it feels like a real place.

1703
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,410
I appreciate you,

1704
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:17,790
uh,

1705
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:18,511
admitting that,

1706
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:20,610
and I say that often as well.

1707
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,810
I think that it feels like a different
dimension that's inhabited with

1708
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:26,130
intelligent thought,

1709
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:26,671
something,

1710
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:27,700
whatever is intelligent.

1711
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:28,400
Something I,

1712
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:28,790
I,

1713
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:29,120
I,

1714
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,480
the way I described as geometric
patterns that are made out of love and

1715
00:50:32,481 --> 00:50:35,210
understanding what it feels like to me,

1716
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,360
I have never had a bad DMT trip
in a sense where it turned evil,

1717
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,180
but I've heard people discuss like really
horrific evil entities if they've run

1718
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:47,510
into,

1719
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:50,120
and I often wonder by virtue of that,

1720
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:54,050
whether or not what they're talking about
is something that's in their psyche.

1721
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,550
Something that's in their subconscious,

1722
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,970
something that I bring it to the party.

1723
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,113
Yes.

1724
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:58,540
My,

1725
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,850
my last DMT trip,

1726
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:00,990
which I mentioned a little while ago,

1727
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,411
which was,

1728
00:51:01,411 --> 00:51:04,590
which was extremely powerful and scary.

1729
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:05,640
Um,

1730
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,870
this was the time,

1731
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,211
this,

1732
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:12,211
this happened just a into two weeks
before I gave up my 24 year kind of what's

1733
00:51:13,421 --> 00:51:14,254
happened.

1734
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:14,820
Um,

1735
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,720
and I think I had some shit to go
through and I think the DMT was partner.

1736
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,790
I then followed that with
five I wasco sessions.

1737
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,710
But I think the DMT was really helpful.

1738
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:24,570
And I may have mentioned this
to you the last time we talked,

1739
00:51:24,571 --> 00:51:25,320
but what,

1740
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,580
but what happened as I,

1741
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,391
as I went under,

1742
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:31,220
I had that fourth deep
inhalation of the pipe lay,

1743
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,590
lay back and,

1744
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,370
and I don't normally hear voices and Dmt,

1745
00:51:35,371 --> 00:51:38,070
but a voice spoke to me
and the voice said to me,

1746
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,170
your hours now,

1747
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:41,700
Whoa,

1748
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,110
your hours now.

1749
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,480
And my last conscious thought was,

1750
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:45,991
shit,

1751
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:46,320
yes,

1752
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,540
but only for only for 12 minutes,

1753
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,440
you know,

1754
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,280
and then,

1755
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,730
and then I,

1756
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:53,640
I've felt myself being ripped apart.

1757
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,600
There were these things,

1758
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:55,650
the small things.

1759
00:51:55,651 --> 00:51:57,850
I was looking on some kind of table and
they were running around me and they

1760
00:51:57,851 --> 00:51:58,860
were tearing me apart.

1761
00:51:58,861 --> 00:52:00,330
My body was torn to pieces,

1762
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:04,850
bits where cast of was like a
cocoon was being ripped away and,

1763
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,360
and,

1764
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,960
and then the voice comes again.

1765
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:09,960
There's like a trumpet call and the
voice comes again and now the great

1766
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,790
transformation shall begin.

1767
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,010
And it was,

1768
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,000
it was the weirdest and
strangest experience.

1769
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:18,930
And I was in this flickering huge space
and these little beings we're running

1770
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:22,800
around me and they were doing it and
I was completely helpless and at their

1771
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:24,090
mercy and that,

1772
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:25,560
that was scary.

1773
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,700
That's amazing.

1774
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,140
But it was not demonic.

1775
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:28,771
It was like,

1776
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:29,604
it was like,

1777
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:30,391
it was like,

1778
00:52:30,391 --> 00:52:32,250
this is stuff you need to go through.

1779
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:33,001
You need to,

1780
00:52:33,001 --> 00:52:34,050
you need to do this.

1781
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:34,801
It's going to be very,

1782
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:35,491
very frightening,

1783
00:52:35,491 --> 00:52:37,150
but it's something you need to do.

1784
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,600
And I did need to do it
and it was helpful to me.

1785
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,670
Was that the first time
you'd heard voices?

1786
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:41,911
Yeah,

1787
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:42,340
I never,

1788
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:42,691
I did.

1789
00:52:42,691 --> 00:52:45,540
I did not hear voices speaking
to me and DMT ever before.

1790
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:46,221
Wow.

1791
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:46,470
I,

1792
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:47,270
my,

1793
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,940
my experiences had been filled with voice.

1794
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:50,470
Oh really?

1795
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:51,303
Yeah.

1796
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:51,771
Well,

1797
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:53,150
one of the big ones is,

1798
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,850
it's a really childish
thing that they would say,

1799
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,040
and this was like when
I was about to leave,

1800
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,450
when I was starting to sober up,

1801
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,471
they would say,

1802
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:02,960
I love you 600 million,

1803
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:03,890
500,000 times.

1804
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,480
Like a child would say,

1805
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:05,631
oh,

1806
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:06,464
I want to hit that.

1807
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,690
I want to hit that more than
I wanted to hear your hours.

1808
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,341
Well,

1809
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:12,380
I think I came into it in a good place.

1810
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,380
I was in a happy place in
my life and I wasn't scared.

1811
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:16,161
I wasn't fighting it.

1812
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:16,760
Yeah.

1813
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,100
But that I love you
thing was really weird.

1814
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,730
The other thing that it said
was the words of Mckenna.

1815
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,800
And I think when I've
tried to analyze this,

1816
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,830
I think that what it was was that I had
listened to so much mckenna before I'd

1817
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,561
gone into it,

1818
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:35,820
that I had sort of stained my
brain with this idea and either my

1819
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:40,680
subconsciousness was saying this
or they were whatever they are,

1820
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:41,460
whether they're,

1821
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:41,821
you know,

1822
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:42,710
a part of my,

1823
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:43,870
my thought process,

1824
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,990
we're projecting this thing,

1825
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,520
this reminder,

1826
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,560
do not give into astonishment.

1827
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,920
And that that was because
it was so mind blowing.

1828
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:58,220
I was flying down this
bumblebee covered like pathway,

1829
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:02,400
this spinning,

1830
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,710
when I say bumblebee co not covered,

1831
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:06,270
rather by colored it was,

1832
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,070
there was very clear black and
yellow stripes of all this thing,

1833
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:12,270
like very bright,

1834
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:14,460
intense black and very bright,

1835
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:15,510
intense yellow.

1836
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,310
And it was moving and like,

1837
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:17,790
like,

1838
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,120
like,

1839
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,570
and I was shooting down
this thing and then it was,

1840
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:24,680
it was saying do not give into
astonishment and it was the word,

1841
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,340
the words of Mckenna but not in,

1842
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:27,300
you know,

1843
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,051
like it wasn't,

1844
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:29,400
I don't think I was his voice.

1845
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:31,020
I think it was like no voice.

1846
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,870
I think it was just the word that thought.

1847
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,930
Well that's the weird thing about the,

1848
00:54:35,931 --> 00:54:36,210
the,

1849
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:36,601
the,

1850
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:38,930
the telepathic thing that you,

1851
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,070
you get from the DMT experiences.

1852
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,810
You understand the words,

1853
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:44,160
it's speaking to you in English,

1854
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:46,140
but it's not really speaking to you.

1855
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:49,560
It's just those things are getting
into your brain very clearly,

1856
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,390
but I'm not really sure you hear them.

1857
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:51,880
Yeah.

1858
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,560
Yeah.

1859
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:52,801
I mean,

1860
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:53,431
here is a,

1861
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:54,570
here is an experience,

1862
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:55,404
which I'm,

1863
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:55,640
well,

1864
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,410
what a pity to go through life
and not have that experience ever.

1865
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,040
Yeah.

1866
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,830
I've said to many people like you,

1867
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,280
you're screwing yourself,

1868
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:03,000
man.

1869
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,833
You're really,

1870
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,560
it's,

1871
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,700
it's scary as shit,

1872
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:06,481
but boy,

1873
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:07,490
do you get a lot out of them.

1874
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:07,750
Yeah.

1875
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,550
Yeah.

1876
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:08,941
And I mean,

1877
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:09,331
in my,

1878
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:10,021
in my case,

1879
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:10,530
the previous,

1880
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,590
most of the previous DMT Giannis I'd had,

1881
00:55:12,591 --> 00:55:13,770
had not been terrifying.

1882
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:16,200
They had been gentle and healing and nice.

1883
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,920
I think that I was at a juncture in my
life where I needed to make a change.

1884
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:24,480
And I think that that particular DMT
experience followed by the five Iowasca

1885
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:27,210
journeys helped me to make that change.

1886
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:27,580
And I'm,

1887
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,980
I'm eternally grateful for that.

1888
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:29,311
It was,

1889
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:31,800
it was a really positive and
beneficial thing for them.

1890
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:32,241
Yeah.

1891
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:34,700
It was very positive and
beneficial for me as well.

1892
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:35,030
Um,

1893
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,863
I was,

1894
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,930
I think I've always wanted a change.

1895
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,320
Well,

1896
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,490
I want to change now.

1897
00:55:40,491 --> 00:55:42,170
I mean I always want more,

1898
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,550
more enlightenment,

1899
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:44,420
more police,

1900
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:44,991
more,

1901
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:46,250
more serenity,

1902
00:55:46,251 --> 00:55:46,970
whatever it is.

1903
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:47,490
Yep.

1904
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:47,990
Um,

1905
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:48,960
and the,

1906
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,251
at the,

1907
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:50,210
at that time,

1908
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,590
I think what I was just trying to
figure out what are the possibilities,

1909
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,940
what else is out there?

1910
00:55:55,941 --> 00:56:00,941
And it was just this one
big rush of impossible
possibilities and that redefined

1911
00:56:02,781 --> 00:56:04,820
my view of reality itself.

1912
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:06,410
It was really scary though.

1913
00:56:06,411 --> 00:56:10,190
The last one was really slippery
because after it was over,

1914
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:15,191
it was so intense and powerful that
regular reality didn't seem real to me.

1915
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:16,034
And I was,

1916
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:16,431
I was,

1917
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:21,431
I went through a period where I feel like
my ego was trying to trick me by being

1918
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:26,200
scared of everything was scared of car
accidents and trees falling in front of

1919
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:29,650
my car and buildings
collapsing and earthquakes.

1920
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,770
There's all these thoughts that came
into my mind that I just went on for four

1921
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,030
days after the Chinese.

1922
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,390
Yeah.

1923
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:34,980
Not,

1924
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,490
it's not intensely strong.

1925
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:38,620
It wasn't like paranoia or um,

1926
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:39,520
excuse me.

1927
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:39,820
Um,

1928
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,810
or anxiety.

1929
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,060
It was like this flittering
thing that I'd go,

1930
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:43,901
no,

1931
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:44,734
stop it.

1932
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,580
Stop it.

1933
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:45,800
Right.

1934
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,320
But like I'd be on the
highway and I'd be like,

1935
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,630
what if this guy just fucking flips the
fucking road and it comes right towards

1936
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:50,530
you and smashed his head on the,

1937
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:50,811
your car,

1938
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:51,840
your dad and all.

1939
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,560
It was all this nonsense that
was just entering into my mind.

1940
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:58,330
And it's not just being aware
of traffic and being smart,

1941
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,380
but possibilities would.

1942
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,341
And I think when a new,

1943
00:57:01,341 --> 00:57:02,500
I haven't been doing that before.

1944
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,150
Never.

1945
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:03,430
No,

1946
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:03,911
never.

1947
00:57:03,911 --> 00:57:04,240
Okay.

1948
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,800
I think what it was was my ego trying
to regain some sort of control.

1949
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:14,190
Is that my ego by protecting me or by
keeping me paranoid and keeping me very

1950
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,890
base and primal and animalistic,

1951
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:21,940
worried about safety and shelter
and disasters and things like that.

1952
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,170
It was trying to regain some strength
because it was so humbled by the

1953
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:28,030
experience as a humbling experience.

1954
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:28,661
Really.

1955
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:29,440
It really is.

1956
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,550
It's one of the most,

1957
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,010
perhaps the most humbling
experience that is,

1958
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,030
that it's possible to have.

1959
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:34,421
And again,

1960
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:35,254
that's why.

1961
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:39,100
That's why it's valuable and and who says
we shouldn't have experiences because

1962
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:39,880
they're scary,

1963
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,713
you know,

1964
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:45,730
these are amongst the most important
experiences it's possible to have.

1965
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,160
I hear you use flotation tanks?

1966
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,073
Yeah.

1967
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,510
How many of my basement you have a,

1968
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,383
do you use it regularly?

1969
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,911
Oh yeah.

1970
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:52,241
Yeah,

1971
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:54,030
I've been using them for a I.

1972
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,820
I bought my house in 2003 so,

1973
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,600
so for,

1974
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,930
for more than 10 years,

1975
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,160
I've had this in my basement.

1976
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,720
Please describe the extent to me.

1977
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:02,680
You get you get into this.

1978
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:03,341
We've never done it.

1979
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:03,880
I've never done.

1980
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,320
Oh my God,

1981
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:04,930
I want to do it.

1982
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,220
Where are you staying
while you're out here?

1983
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,971
I was thinking money.

1984
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:07,804
Food with friends.

1985
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:08,920
Oh it perfect.

1986
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,630
I'll get you in if you
want to go tomorrow.

1987
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:10,990
Okay.

1988
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,910
There's a place in Venice
called the float lab,

1989
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,690
also the best place in the country and
you just go in there and float ass.

1990
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:17,524
It's amazing.

1991
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,490
You don't need anything.

1992
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,050
I'd like to do two hours.

1993
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,320
Okay.

1994
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,131
If I have two hours,

1995
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,000
but if I only have an hour,

1996
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:24,580
I'll set a timer and I'll
put a timer outside of the,

1997
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:24,820
uh,

1998
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,950
the box so I can hear it when it goes off.

1999
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,820
But uh,

2000
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,750
that's my old one.

2001
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:29,291
You see it up there.

2002
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:29,920
That's my,

2003
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,230
that's a Samadi tank that I had.

2004
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,990
The one that I have now though
is built by the float lab,

2005
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:36,760
which is far more complicated.

2006
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:38,200
It's a really immense,

2007
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:40,120
huge seven feet tall,

2008
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,880
nine feet wide or nine foot long,

2009
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:43,900
six foot wide.

2010
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:44,883
It's huge.

2011
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:45,641
It's like a,

2012
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:47,200
it looks like a walk in freezer.

2013
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:47,590
Okay.

2014
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,480
And it has oxygen pumped into it.

2015
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,141
When you're in it,

2016
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:50,861
you're in water,

2017
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:51,450
right?

2018
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,720
There's salt water to keeps you,

2019
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,700
keeps you suspension.

2020
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,533
Do you have a done,

2021
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,980
we're going to change your life tomorrow.

2022
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,990
It's amazing.

2023
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,260
It's like a psychedelic experience
except completely natural.

2024
00:59:02,261 --> 00:59:03,011
Completely safe.

2025
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:04,330
And you can end it anytime you want,

2026
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,860
but that's my new tank.

2027
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:06,940
But when you,

2028
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,500
when you climb into that thing,

2029
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:13,910
the water is set to the same temperature
as the surface of your skin and there's

2030
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:16,570
a thousand pounds of salt in that water.

2031
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,350
It used to be 800 in my smaller tank or
this one's a thousand and so you can't

2032
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:20,750
sync.

2033
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,321
Exactly.

2034
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:22,540
It's about 11 inches deep.

2035
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,240
So even if you did sank
and you can't fall down,

2036
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,690
you're fine and you're floating.

2037
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:30,830
Like the half of your body is above
the water and as you live there,

2038
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,690
you're in total silence,

2039
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,470
total darkness.

2040
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,810
Your ears are actually underwater.

2041
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,790
You close the lid on this thing
and you don't hear a thing,

2042
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:38,750
you don't see a thing,

2043
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:43,190
you have no input and you don't feel
the water because the water is the same

2044
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:43,730
temperature,

2045
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,480
your skin,

2046
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,400
so you're floating completely weightless.

2047
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,740
It's really great for your body.

2048
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:50,170
It feels great because you,

2049
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,320
you would leave V8 all the
pressures of gravity and stress,

2050
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:56,990
you feel your muscles
relaxing and unwinding.

2051
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:58,503
And you,

2052
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,390
for me,

2053
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,940
the way I describe it as
the first 20 minutes or so,

2054
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:03,710
it seems like a seminar on my life.

2055
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,980
It gets me to start examining various
aspects of the stuff that goes through

2056
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:10,820
like a life review in the
absence of sensory input.

2057
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:11,380
You know,

2058
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,340
like even while we're
having this conversation,

2059
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:14,360
it's very quiet in the air,

2060
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,440
but we're,

2061
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:20,030
we're having to deal with the fact
that there's computers or screens,

2062
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:20,860
ceiling.

2063
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,010
There's your bud is chair.

2064
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:23,540
Yup.

2065
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,540
All those things are gone
in that tank and the tank,

2066
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:28,010
it's just your mind.

2067
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,050
It's the only place ever,

2068
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:34,400
the only environment on earth where
your mind is untethered from your body.

2069
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,631
It's an amazing,

2070
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:38,450
amazing experience and completely safe,

2071
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:39,500
completely natural,

2072
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:40,550
completely beneficial,

2073
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:41,810
completely refreshing.

2074
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:42,861
It's amazing.

2075
01:00:42,861 --> 01:00:44,960
Even if you're not into the
psychedelic aspect of it,

2076
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:45,950
you just want to relax.

2077
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,270
It's incredible.

2078
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,133
I love it.

2079
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:50,240
It should be something that
everyone has in their home,

2080
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:50,510
right.

2081
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,450
It would benefit so many
people in so many ways.

2082
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:54,890
Do you get into visionary space?

2083
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:56,520
Absolutely.

2084
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,760
Especially when you're going
and little smoker smoking.

2085
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,830
But that's say the experience was,

2086
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:04,400
it said no shows mushrooms enhance it.

2087
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,230
Um,

2088
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:05,640
uh,

2089
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,070
but although a mushrooms are,

2090
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,150
it's scary in there.

2091
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:08,661
Uh,

2092
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:09,890
I like cannabis,

2093
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:10,611
cannabis,

2094
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:12,050
eating cannabis is my favorite.

2095
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:16,310
I like to eat enough cannabis that I feel
like I fucked up and ate too much and

2096
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:17,000
then get in there.

2097
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,270
Right.

2098
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,200
That's the about those,

2099
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:21,710
and those are intensely
psychedelic and very visionary.

2100
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,310
But what I like about it is you can
end it pretty much at any moment.

2101
01:01:25,311 --> 01:01:25,510
Yeah.

2102
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:26,660
And when you open the door,

2103
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,381
you,

2104
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:29,090
you'll use the cannabis will still affect,

2105
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:30,980
you still have the weirdness of that,

2106
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:35,000
but all the nutty hallucinations
and visuals will all go away.

2107
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,140
You just step out.

2108
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:36,381
Yeah.

2109
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:39,800
You just step out and you can get to
that place without the cannabis as well.

2110
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:43,520
I know a lot of people that have really
intense psychedelic visions while

2111
01:01:43,521 --> 01:01:45,770
they're in the isolation tank.

2112
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:46,791
Interesting.

2113
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:46,911
Well,

2114
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,230
this is an experience I have to have.

2115
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,801
You've got to have it.

2116
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:49,634
You're going to have it tomorrow.

2117
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,920
Do you have a day off or you're
afraid you don't have a total day off?

2118
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:53,030
But I can get two hours.

2119
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:53,470
Okay.

2120
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,620
It will work it in and we'll make it.

2121
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,420
We'll make it happen.

2122
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:55,760
All right.

2123
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,001
Um,

2124
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:56,570
crash.

2125
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:00,020
Who's the guy who runs the float lab
in Venice is a great friend and a great

2126
01:02:00,021 --> 01:02:00,854
guy.

2127
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:01,761
He's a genius.

2128
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:02,150
He's,

2129
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,690
he's the wizard behind the curtain that
creates the greatest tanks on earth.

2130
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:06,501
He's just nutty,

2131
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:11,501
nutty dude that I just worked incredibly
hard to figure out a way to make.

2132
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,830
There's like,

2133
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:13,490
there's his,

2134
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:14,323
there's tanks,

2135
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,590
there's like this somebody tank,

2136
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:16,490
which is a very good tank,

2137
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,271
very functional.

2138
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:18,020
You can use it.

2139
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,060
There's a bunch of different companies
that have tanks and then there's his tank

2140
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,950
and the difference is like a modern
BMW compared to a model t Ford.

2141
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:26,280
Okay.

2142
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,510
Like literally it's that good.

2143
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:27,841
Oh,

2144
01:02:27,841 --> 01:02:28,531
it's amazing.

2145
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:29,040
He's a,

2146
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,120
he's just a genius.

2147
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:30,480
He's,

2148
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,670
he figured out a way to
pump oxygen into them.

2149
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,630
He also figured out a way to
flush all the water through ozone.

2150
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:38,400
It kills all the bacteria.

2151
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:41,430
He has like incredibly
intense filtration systems.

2152
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,490
Four and five step processes
are filtering the water,

2153
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,130
like all of his equipment that he
has attached to all this stuff.

2154
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,380
Nobody's rocking it like that.

2155
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:49,890
I mean,

2156
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,540
he takes it too literally.

2157
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,650
Then he,

2158
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:55,320
the next level is not
even a mile from him.

2159
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:55,620
He's,

2160
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,453
he's gone.

2161
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:57,190
He's on a,

2162
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,190
he's in a place all by his own with
what he's creating at the fund.

2163
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,320
You're in total silence.

2164
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,220
Total silence.

2165
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:02,820
Total dog.

2166
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,780
Total darkness.

2167
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:05,640
And you don't feel a thing.

2168
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:09,690
You feel like you're flying through
space because your body is completely

2169
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:10,171
weightless.

2170
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:11,760
It's the weirdest feeling ever,

2171
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,631
but it's amazing.

2172
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:13,320
You've convinced me.

2173
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:13,800
Oh,

2174
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,480
I can't believe you haven't done it,

2175
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,520
but you're such a psychedelic adventure.

2176
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:19,350
I would have thought that a
been a part of your daily life.

2177
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:20,130
It hasn't been with it.

2178
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,600
We've got to set you
up with one in England,

2179
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:22,240
man.

2180
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,520
We've got to send one over there and,

2181
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:24,140
okay,

2182
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:24,490
send,

2183
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,323
crash over.

2184
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,440
Have them set you up in
your basement or something.

2185
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:29,160
It's,

2186
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,560
I wouldn't live in a house if
I didn't have space for one.

2187
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:32,040
Right.

2188
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:32,491
Literally,

2189
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:33,390
it's that important to you.

2190
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,740
To me it's massive.

2191
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:38,450
Anytime I've got something I'm thinking
about or trying to work on or or,

2192
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:38,820
or,

2193
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,600
you know,

2194
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,370
new material and ideas,

2195
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:41,881
I go,

2196
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:42,990
I go through Jujitsu,

2197
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:43,824
moves in there,

2198
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,810
I go through scenarios,

2199
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,190
I'll,

2200
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:46,400
I'll,

2201
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,700
I'll visually spar.

2202
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,510
Okay.

2203
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:48,751
Yeah.

2204
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:49,580
It's amazing.

2205
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,220
Yeah.

2206
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:50,521
It's,

2207
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:50,880
it's,

2208
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,880
you don't get an opportunity to have
the mind at its full resource capacity

2209
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,740
other than in that tank.

2210
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:04,350
And this world constantly bombarding
sensation of all kinds were torn apart and

2211
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:07,440
they can't wait to talk to you.

2212
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:08,503
You get out.

2213
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:14,750
Have you seen this new skull that they
found the 1.8 million year old human

2214
01:04:15,391 --> 01:04:16,224
skull?

2215
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:17,310
No.

2216
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:17,701
Yeah.

2217
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:21,360
This is a amazing
discovery that they found.

2218
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,170
Um,

2219
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:22,501
this,

2220
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:23,130
uh,

2221
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:26,910
first completely preserved and we
see the Gulf commented from the early

2222
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:27,870
Pleistocene.

2223
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:28,550
Yeah,

2224
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:28,741
yeah,

2225
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:29,190
yeah.

2226
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,540
See if you could pull that up Jamie.

2227
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,000
It's 1.8 million year old skull.

2228
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:33,780
Um,

2229
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:34,613
but it's,

2230
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:35,250
it's,

2231
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,710
it's a really amazing find and um,

2232
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:43,440
they found it in Georgia and the eastern
Europe and it's the fifth such skull

2233
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:44,370
from this region,

2234
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,560
but it's 1.8 million years old.

2235
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,750
That's really old.

2236
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:49,291
That is,

2237
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:50,124
um,

2238
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,230
that is a,

2239
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,113
there it is.

2240
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,431
Let me see what they have.

2241
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,530
Any still images of it,

2242
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,991
but uh,

2243
01:04:57,991 --> 01:04:58,501
these,

2244
01:04:58,501 --> 01:04:59,100
uh,

2245
01:04:59,100 --> 01:04:59,311
they're,

2246
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:00,420
they're completely,

2247
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:05,080
it's thrown a gigantic monkey
wrench into our timeline of,

2248
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,270
of human evolution.

2249
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:09,660
They found stone tools and
cut marks on animal bones,

2250
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:13,860
which indicates that the hominids were
actively involved in meat processing.

2251
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,600
This is amazing,

2252
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,463
but is it a,

2253
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:18,220
is it a recognizable species

2254
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,460
of early man has quite
prominent brow ridges?

2255
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:22,810
It's um,

2256
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:23,321
well it's,

2257
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:25,030
it's some sort of early man,

2258
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:25,420
um,

2259
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,410
what they're calling it.

2260
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:27,131
Let's see what they,

2261
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:27,880
uh,

2262
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,840
what they're calling it.

2263
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,090
They haven't,

2264
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:32,770
it hasn't received a name yet.

2265
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,930
Have they wanted to kill Lucy?

2266
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,680
And any idea about the size of the brain?

2267
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,060
Um,

2268
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:37,960
that's a good question.

2269
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:39,250
They're calling it

2270
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,330
golf five.

2271
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,010
It says your skull five is different,

2272
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:42,671
different even in the,

2273
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:46,560
for the skulls found in a
demand to seize the name.

2274
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:51,740
The area is found a 2005 and completely
and ultimately matched at jaw found in

2275
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,130
2000 to make a complete skull.

2276
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,480
After eight years of study,

2277
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:59,150
scientists on Thursday published a paper
in the Journal of Science revealing

2278
01:05:59,151 --> 01:06:00,100
that skull five.

2279
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:02,440
It's simply not that
different from others.

2280
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:07,720
The five demand demand Hussey individuals
are no more different from each other

2281
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:09,850
than any five modern humans.

2282
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:11,440
Or chimpanzees said,

2283
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,670
neurobiologists blah,

2284
01:06:12,671 --> 01:06:12,791
blah,

2285
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:13,624
blah.

2286
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:14,781
So the,

2287
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:18,610
the brain case itself is very small
around the third of the size of modern

2288
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:19,051
humans.

2289
01:06:19,051 --> 01:06:19,190
Okay.

2290
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,641
Okay.

2291
01:06:19,641 --> 01:06:22,790
And at the same time or for quite large?

2292
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,110
Um,

2293
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:24,291
yeah,

2294
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:24,501
I mean,

2295
01:06:24,501 --> 01:06:25,280
I'm not sure.

2296
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,510
I'm not sure I'd need to read it.

2297
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:29,360
I'm not sure how much
that changes history.

2298
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:29,601
I mean,

2299
01:06:29,601 --> 01:06:32,300
we know that there were
human species around one,

2300
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,650
1.8,

2301
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:34,770
1.9 the,

2302
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:38,930
our ancestors were making tools
two and a half million years ago.

2303
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:39,381
Uh,

2304
01:06:39,381 --> 01:06:40,191
so this is,

2305
01:06:40,191 --> 01:06:41,000
um,

2306
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,260
this is well within that,

2307
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:42,531
well,

2308
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:43,700
within the time frame,

2309
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:48,350
I think what maybe what it's showing
us is that there've been many lines of

2310
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:49,100
human,

2311
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:49,700
um,

2312
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,060
down,

2313
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,320
down through the ages and like,

2314
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:53,470
like this one that they called the Hobbit,

2315
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:53,751
you know,

2316
01:06:53,751 --> 01:06:55,160
Florida into tiny little creature,

2317
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:59,540
which lived until 18 or 16,000
years ago and florists in,

2318
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:00,710
in Indonesia.

2319
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:01,940
Um,

2320
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:04,490
that was completely unpredicted as well.

2321
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:09,491
Then maybe there'd been many human types
and we don't know where we actually

2322
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:10,880
come from in this whole,

2323
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:11,870
in this whole picture.

2324
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:12,411
Yeah.

2325
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:16,390
These last hominids that
they keep discovering like
homo floresiensis and like

2326
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,650
that a Russian one that they
found that was a basically 40,000

2327
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,270
is all the completely different,

2328
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,220
completely defeat the Soviet.

2329
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:25,000
Yes.

2330
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,751
Fascinating,

2331
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:26,800
fascinating stuff.

2332
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,480
And 40,000 years ago,

2333
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:30,040
a blink of an eye blink of an eye.

2334
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:30,620
Nothing.

2335
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:30,870
Yeah,

2336
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,650
just a completely different type of human.

2337
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,410
Yeah.

2338
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:33,680
So,

2339
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:33,920
uh,

2340
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,430
again,

2341
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:37,270
what it adds up to is the
realization that we know nothing.

2342
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:37,850
Actually.

2343
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:38,110
We,

2344
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:38,370
we'd,

2345
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:39,280
we know very little.

2346
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:40,750
We come out of mystery,

2347
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,020
we live in mystery and we end in mystery.

2348
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,910
Have you heard of the Orang?

2349
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,250
Pendek yes.

2350
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,610
This is cryptozoology.

2351
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:49,770
What Lazier.

2352
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,480
That's what my wife comes
from Malaysia and they,

2353
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:55,550
and it's a kind of Yeti Malaysian
Yeti or Malaysia and big foot.

2354
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:56,830
It's tiny,

2355
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:57,160
but,

2356
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:57,790
but uh,

2357
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:58,481
but it's a,

2358
01:07:58,481 --> 01:08:00,550
it's a wild creature man,

2359
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:02,920
like creature that lives
into the lives in the woods.

2360
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:03,161
Well,

2361
01:08:03,161 --> 01:08:06,240
very similar to Homo
Floria and homophobia is,

2362
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:10,780
and so the suggestion is Orang Pendek
is homo floresiensis or whatever it's

2363
01:08:10,781 --> 01:08:11,110
called.

2364
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,010
He's still alive,

2365
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,400
hanging out in the world.

2366
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:15,620
It would sound ridiculous.

2367
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:16,190
But this

2368
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:16,820
homo,

2369
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,451
what it was called,

2370
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:17,721
Hobbit,

2371
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:17,931
man,

2372
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:20,120
this hobbit man was only 13,

2373
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,260
14,000 years ago.

2374
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,000
Very recently within the,

2375
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:25,430
the span almost of human history.

2376
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:28,880
I mean go Beckley Tappi and take you
where I've just been as 12,000 plus years

2377
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:29,090
old.

2378
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:29,310
Yeah.

2379
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,320
Making these massive,

2380
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:32,360
great megalithic pillars there.

2381
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,630
So this creature on Flores is,

2382
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:36,260
um,

2383
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,130
just that period,

2384
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:37,790
just the same,

2385
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,481
the same age as that.

2386
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:39,314
So the world was,

2387
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,460
was filled with,

2388
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,440
with all kinds of different creatures.

2389
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,460
By the way,

2390
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,470
on talking about Indonesia,

2391
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,980
I'm going to Indonesia
on the 3rd of December,

2392
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:49,700
um,

2393
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,880
because there's been a new
site or rather an old site,

2394
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,280
which has been radically
redated in Indonesia,

2395
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,710
which is called Gunung Padang,

2396
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,150
not that far from florists.

2397
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:00,050
As a matter of fact,

2398
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:00,740
uh,

2399
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,540
it's a megalithic site with,

2400
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:02,960
uh,

2401
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,510
with gigantic basle columns.

2402
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,501
And,

2403
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:06,621
uh,

2404
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:10,130
this place has been known
since the early 20th century,

2405
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:12,590
thought to be about
three or 4,000 years old.

2406
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:15,740
But there's an Australian
geologists called Danny Hilman,

2407
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:19,490
who's been working for the Indonesian
government on a site survey for the last

2408
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:20,031
five years.

2409
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:23,900
And he's just in the last month or two
come out with this explosive finding that

2410
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:27,620
he thinks this site is possibly
as much as 20,000 years old,

2411
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,510
which a Megalithic site,

2412
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,620
20,000 years old.

2413
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:32,570
That completely rewrites history.

2414
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,051
Go back,

2415
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:35,000
leave Tapi already pretty
much rewrites history.

2416
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:37,220
But this place in
Indonesia totally does it.

2417
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:38,780
And when you take the two together,

2418
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:39,410
so I'm,

2419
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:41,720
I'm going to go out and take a look
at that site and meet Danny Hilman.

2420
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:42,590
What is the name of it again?

2421
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:43,870
Can you spell Pedang?

2422
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:44,650
Whoa,

2423
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:45,410
good on padding.

2424
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,270
I may be able to show you a picture of it.

2425
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:48,740
Jamie.

2426
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,311
Put it up right?

2427
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:50,091
It's going to be padding.

2428
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:50,330
Yeah,

2429
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,320
that is totally good.

2430
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:52,130
And padding.

2431
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,030
I used that picture.

2432
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:57,890
So all these stones and what made
them date this to 20,000 years?

2433
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:58,641
What was the chase?

2434
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:02,450
So the previous dating has just been
based on the surface layers and Danny

2435
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:06,350
Hilleman and his team had been down
deep into this manmade hill on on top of

2436
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:08,360
which the surface layer stand and they've,

2437
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:11,480
and they've gone all the way down and
they're finding big megaliths right down

2438
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:15,530
at the bottom and they're finding
associated carbon that that allows them to

2439
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:17,330
date it to up to 20,000 years old.

2440
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,070
So this is a,

2441
01:10:19,071 --> 01:10:21,850
I mean this is a real huge game
changer that was taking place there.

2442
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:22,790
So when they dated,

2443
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,130
when they carbon dated
down to 20,000 years old,

2444
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:26,540
is it based on organic material?

2445
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:27,200
That has to be,

2446
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,270
you can't cause you can't date,

2447
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,270
you can't date stone,

2448
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:33,890
but what you do is you get
into undisturbed layers
deep down in that manmade

2449
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:35,690
hill that we're looking at
on the screen right now,

2450
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,020
you get down into undisturbed layers
where you're finding megaliths at the

2451
01:10:39,021 --> 01:10:39,741
bottom covered,

2452
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:40,461
covered by earth,

2453
01:10:40,461 --> 01:10:42,410
being covered by earth for 20,000 years.

2454
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:44,840
And amongst that earth
is organic material,

2455
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,100
fragments of bone,

2456
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,620
fragments of charcoal that you
can date with carbon dating.

2457
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:52,700
So you can then say that those
megaliths are at least that old,

2458
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,451
at least,

2459
01:10:53,451 --> 01:10:54,650
at least most likely,

2460
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:55,250
much older,

2461
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,420
maybe much older than that,

2462
01:10:56,421 --> 01:10:57,620
but they're at least that old.

2463
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:01,910
And the weird thing with this that this
place has in common with Gabelli Tapi is

2464
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:03,920
that both of them are manmade hills,

2465
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:07,970
which appeared to have had some kind of
deliberate burial of the earlier layers,

2466
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:08,360
like a,

2467
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:08,750
like a,

2468
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,830
like a time capsule show.

2469
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:10,700
I get this feeling that,

2470
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:11,421
you know,

2471
01:11:11,421 --> 01:11:12,440
stuff is um,

2472
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,680
stuff is out.

2473
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:13,980
Uh,

2474
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,510
stuff is a stuff is coming out into the
open that's been been suppressed for a

2475
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:19,201
long time or,

2476
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:20,490
or ignored or just not,

2477
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,990
not reckoned with for a very,

2478
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:22,920
for a very long time.

2479
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,251
Well,

2480
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:27,570
go back Lee tabby was a real game changer
because that was the first time that

2481
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:32,400
they had found anything that you had
to date back to at least 12,000 years.

2482
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:33,360
Go back,

2483
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,500
go back to the happy is really,

2484
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:35,431
really important.

2485
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:36,210
And that's why I was,

2486
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:40,980
I was glad to be able to go there in
September and spent a lot of time just

2487
01:11:40,981 --> 01:11:43,380
gently getting to getting
to know this site.

2488
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,243
The reason,

2489
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:48,990
the reason it's important is
because it was deliberately buried.

2490
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,430
Um,

2491
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:50,741
and,

2492
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:52,440
and what it raises is,

2493
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:52,760
uh,

2494
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,470
I just want to show you this
cover from New Scientist magazine.

2495
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,131
Can we,

2496
01:11:56,131 --> 01:11:56,964
can we show this?

2497
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,133
Sure.

2498
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,213
There it is.

2499
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,530
The true dawn that we get that up there.

2500
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:01,791
We'll,

2501
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,570
we'll pull it up or have Jamie pull it up.

2502
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:06,360
Civilization is older and more
mysterious than we thought.

2503
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:06,781
Wow.

2504
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:07,614
New Systems,

2505
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,160
New Scientist magazine in
the beginning of October,

2506
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,120
2013 now new scientists was,

2507
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:16,990
what are the magazines that attacked me
massively back in 1995 when I publish

2508
01:12:16,991 --> 01:12:20,250
fingerprints of the Gods and what did
I say is in fingerprints of the gods.

2509
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,420
Civilization is much older and much more
mysterious than we thought and now they

2510
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:25,470
come out with this cover,

2511
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:25,801
you know,

2512
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:27,150
so I got to feel a certain,

2513
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,440
a certain feeling of,

2514
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:28,660
ah,

2515
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,010
I dunno.

2516
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:30,240
Almost smugness.

2517
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:30,880
Oh yeah,

2518
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,713
sure.

2519
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,000
You can hear your voice.

2520
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:33,870
You just get all giddy.

2521
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,793
It's fun.

2522
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:36,450
It's fun to see them doing that.

2523
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:39,240
And the reason they're saying that is
I've got a lot to do with Rebecca tappy

2524
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,171
because,

2525
01:12:40,171 --> 01:12:42,120
because go Beckley Tapi is that,

2526
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:44,410
it's something completely
unpredicted that,

2527
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:48,270
that what are supposed to be a hunter
gatherers at the end of the Upper

2528
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:52,650
Paleolithic or not supposed to have
the kind of organizational skills,

2529
01:12:52,651 --> 01:12:56,790
the architectural skills to put
together gigantic megalithic circles.

2530
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:57,990
There's one of the,

2531
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,870
one of the pillows that I
went and took a look at,

2532
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:01,480
which they didn't,

2533
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:04,500
they never removed it from the quarry
because they found a fault in it.

2534
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,400
Um,

2535
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,690
it wasn't that they couldn't remove it,

2536
01:13:06,691 --> 01:13:07,590
they found a fault in it,

2537
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:10,710
and that one weighs
more than fifth 50 tons,

2538
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:11,011
you know,

2539
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:11,391
as a judge.

2540
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:13,110
Just a gigantic piece of stone.

2541
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,450
And the other intriguing
thing about correctly,

2542
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,480
Tefi is a,

2543
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,890
which I learned from plush
Schmidt when I was talking to him,

2544
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,900
is they've done ground penetrating radar.

2545
01:13:21,901 --> 01:13:23,340
So right now when you go to the side,

2546
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:28,341
you see for substantial stone circles
on the scale of Stonehenge above ground

2547
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,000
because you put the microphone costs,

2548
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,213
sorry.

2549
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:32,550
Yeah,

2550
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:33,120
when you go,

2551
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,410
when you go to go back to the Tempe,

2552
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:35,101
now you see it,

2553
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:36,810
you see a group of stone circles,

2554
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:37,740
four of them above,

2555
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:38,603
above ground.

2556
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,533
There it is there.

2557
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:40,290
And,

2558
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:40,741
and,

2559
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:41,460
um,

2560
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,000
uh,

2561
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,350
what they've done is they've done ground
penetrating radar over the site and

2562
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:50,820
they found that at least 20 times as
many stone circles are still underground

2563
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:53,490
and possibly as many as 50 times as many.

2564
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,680
So it's a just a gigantic site.

2565
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,340
And,

2566
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,270
and why it's important is that
whoever made it 12,000 years ago,

2567
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,760
deliberately buried it 2000 years later,

2568
01:14:02,761 --> 01:14:03,780
10,000 years ago.

2569
01:14:03,781 --> 01:14:08,781
So that meant that the carbon dating
record has not been contaminated by later

2570
01:14:09,121 --> 01:14:09,954
cultures.

2571
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:13,120
It's a perfect pristine time capsule.

2572
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,290
And Lo and behold,

2573
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:17,500
the date that it prints
out is 12,000 years old.

2574
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:18,340
Um,

2575
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:22,540
now that then raises questions over lots
of other megalithic sites all over the

2576
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:22,841
world,

2577
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:25,300
which have been contaminated
by later cultures.

2578
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,880
The megalithic sites of Malta,

2579
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:28,720
for example,

2580
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:31,090
look very like go back the Tempe,

2581
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,250
they look very likability.

2582
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:32,620
Tempe,

2583
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,050
but they're only supposed
to be 5,000 years old.

2584
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:39,910
I would now say we need to reconsider
that evidence because those sites were

2585
01:14:39,911 --> 01:14:41,290
contaminated by later culture.

2586
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:44,590
Maybe the carbon on which they were
dated was introduced by a later culture.

2587
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:46,530
Maybe it doesn't belong to the,

2588
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:49,000
the period of the
construction of the megaliths.

2589
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:49,720
Um,

2590
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:49,901
well,

2591
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:50,740
this alone,

2592
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:51,431
this one,

2593
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:56,431
discovery alone really is a huge game
changer because now we know that people

2594
01:14:56,441 --> 01:14:59,650
were capable of doing something
like that 12,000 years ago and,

2595
01:14:59,660 --> 01:14:59,860
and,

2596
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,191
and not,

2597
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:03,280
and not a task to be
underestimated because you're,

2598
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:05,830
you're in an area where there
isn't a lot of water available.

2599
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:06,241
So you,

2600
01:15:06,241 --> 01:15:06,430
you,

2601
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:06,721
you,

2602
01:15:06,721 --> 01:15:08,350
you're bringing in hundreds of people.

2603
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:13,500
You're organizing them into teams to
construct these gigantic male ethics

2604
01:15:13,591 --> 01:15:14,380
circles.

2605
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,191
You're feeding them,

2606
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:16,300
you're watering them.

2607
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:16,841
Uh,

2608
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:17,260
your hat,

2609
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,640
you have site planning and arrangement.

2610
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:22,390
All of this is the kind of stuff that
you expect much later in human history.

2611
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:24,220
You don't expect it 12,000 years ago.

2612
01:15:24,221 --> 01:15:25,690
And it raises that big question,

2613
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:26,290
you know,

2614
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:27,123
could there,

2615
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,690
could there have been a lost civilization?

2616
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:29,950
Could we be looking at the work,

2617
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:31,960
perhaps of the survivors
of a lost civilization?

2618
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,960
How do we know that they
covered it intentionally?

2619
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:35,920
Um,

2620
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,350
there's a,

2621
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,020
there's a deliberate infill,

2622
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:38,980
the nature of the,

2623
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:40,900
of the earth that's been put into it.

2624
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:44,770
You can pretty much say here where people
with spades pouring this earth in all

2625
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:47,920
in one girl filling it in and
amongst the earth there are bits,

2626
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:48,970
they're fragments of bone,

2627
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:49,990
there a fragrance of carbon.

2628
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:50,824
And that's how they've,

2629
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:51,850
that's how they've dated it.

2630
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,331
It's not,

2631
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:53,164
it's not a,

2632
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:57,100
it's not a natural sedimentation that
built up over a long period of time.

2633
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:58,031
It's a,

2634
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:01,870
it's something that was done all at
once in a planned and organized way.

2635
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:03,250
So for some reason,

2636
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,320
and the collage,

2637
01:16:04,321 --> 01:16:04,620
Schmidt,

2638
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:04,771
the,

2639
01:16:04,771 --> 01:16:07,740
the German archaeologist who's running
the site is not clear what this reason

2640
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,320
was.

2641
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,131
For some reason,

2642
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:10,360
whoever created this place,

2643
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:12,100
decommissioned it at a certain point,

2644
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:13,360
about 10,000 years ago,

2645
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:17,550
they closed it down
and then this is eerie.

2646
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,820
For the next 10,000 years,

2647
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:22,150
it remained untouched and
nobody went there and nobody,

2648
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,780
nobody saw it back in the 50s.

2649
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:26,710
Some American archeologists
were attracted to the site,

2650
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:31,740
they saw bits of cut stone lying on the
surface and the cut stone was so good

2651
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,730
that they concluded it was recent.

2652
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,040
They thought it must be
from the Ottoman period,

2653
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:36,490
uh,

2654
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:36,791
you know,

2655
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:37,241
15,

2656
01:16:37,241 --> 01:16:37,931
1600,

2657
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:38,770
something like that.

2658
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:39,431
Uh,

2659
01:16:39,431 --> 01:16:39,791
and,

2660
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:40,330
and they,

2661
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,230
they ignored it.

2662
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,640
And it was a really a lucky turn
of the spade by Klaus Schmidt,

2663
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:44,851
this,

2664
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:47,530
this German archeologists that revealed
that that's not the case at all.

2665
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,800
And that these are 12,000
year old megalithic pillars.

2666
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,750
And not only that,

2667
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:57,640
so we have this incredible innovation
in architecture taking place,

2668
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,800
stone circles on the scale of Stonehenge,

2669
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:04,500
but 7,000 years earlier than Stonehenge
being created it correctly Tempe.

2670
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:05,560
But at the same time,

2671
01:17:05,561 --> 01:17:08,320
mysteriously agriculture
starts to appear in that area.

2672
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:11,540
There hasn't been agriculture there
before or anywhere so far as we know.

2673
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:13,700
And suddenly it starts to appear there.

2674
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,500
Domesticating cattle there,

2675
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,750
domesticating wheat,

2676
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,291
uh,

2677
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:18,621
and,

2678
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:19,071
and,

2679
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:19,370
uh,

2680
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:19,881
beginning.

2681
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:21,860
This is the beginning of
the agricultural revolution.

2682
01:17:21,861 --> 01:17:23,390
So it's like a center of innovation,

2683
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:24,020
uh,

2684
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:24,501
that we do it,

2685
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:27,830
that we're doing something unique
as far as we know in human history,

2686
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:28,850
in terms of architecture.

2687
01:17:28,851 --> 01:17:32,570
We're doing something unique in terms
of economics producing the first,

2688
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:34,970
the first agriculture and I,

2689
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:36,990
I can't help feeling that the,

2690
01:17:36,991 --> 01:17:41,991
that this thing happens so suddenly and
in such an extraordinary way that maybe,

2691
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,500
maybe this is the,

2692
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,590
the missing link that we are looking at.

2693
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,410
We're looking at the fingerprints
of a lost civilization,

2694
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:52,580
the survivors of a lost civilization
who settled there with all these skills

2695
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:57,610
already in place and introduce them into
the local culture because this period,

2696
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:02,870
12,000 years ago plus is the period
when the earth went through gigantic

2697
01:18:02,871 --> 01:18:05,180
cataclysmic events because
it was struck by a comment.

2698
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:05,961
Yeah.

2699
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:06,621
And that's the,

2700
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:06,920
uh,

2701
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,420
that's the other piece of the puzzle.

2702
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:10,760
The nuclear glass that they've found.

2703
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,500
How do you say to stop trying,

2704
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:13,910
try night tight,

2705
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,670
trinet tight trinet,

2706
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:21,190
trinet tight and that they
have found this stuff all over.

2707
01:18:21,191 --> 01:18:21,240
Yeah.

2708
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,020
Or Europe

2709
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,070
and all over Asia,

2710
01:18:23,071 --> 01:18:24,950
all over the world at that precise,

2711
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,940
precise 12,000 years ago,

2712
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,180
layer of platinum in
the Greenland ice cores.

2713
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:32,460
All of this says Earth was hit by a,

2714
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:34,320
by a comet at that,

2715
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:35,183
at that time.

2716
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:36,630
Is that the Holocene?

2717
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,021
Well,

2718
01:18:37,021 --> 01:18:37,950
that's the beginning of this.

2719
01:18:37,951 --> 01:18:38,611
The end of the,

2720
01:18:38,611 --> 01:18:39,870
it's the beginning of the Holocene.

2721
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,770
The Holocene is our period is
the period we still live in now.

2722
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:43,271
But it's the,

2723
01:18:43,271 --> 01:18:45,180
in in archeological terms,

2724
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,390
it's the juncture between the Upper
Paleolithic and the Neolithic.

2725
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:49,110
That's,

2726
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,943
that's what we're,

2727
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:51,450
that's what we're talking about here.

2728
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:52,410
Um,

2729
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:56,730
and you have this episode that
geologists called the younger Dryas,

2730
01:18:56,970 --> 01:19:01,970
which is an episode of a sudden
a deep freeze strikes the earth.

2731
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:06,450
The earth has been emerging from
the Ice Age until 12,980 years ago.

2732
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:07,021
And Amazingly,

2733
01:19:07,021 --> 01:19:09,930
you can date it that precisely
give or take five years.

2734
01:19:09,931 --> 01:19:12,390
This happened 12,980 years ago.

2735
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:16,500
And then suddenly the earth flips into
this thousand year deep freeze that

2736
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:21,501
nobody's ever been able to explain before
that they called the younger dryas.

2737
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:26,640
And now we can say for sure
that the younger dryas was
caused by huge amounts of

2738
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:30,150
dust being projected into the upper
atmosphere of the earth by this comet

2739
01:19:30,151 --> 01:19:30,984
impact.

2740
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:35,580
And that that dust in shrouded the whole
earth and set in motion a kind of what

2741
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:37,290
we would call a nuclear winter today,

2742
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:37,951
where,

2743
01:19:37,951 --> 01:19:41,310
where the sun's rays could no longer
reach the earth and the earth went back

2744
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,780
into a deep freeze.

2745
01:19:42,781 --> 01:19:43,231
And for me,

2746
01:19:43,231 --> 01:19:45,780
this is the smoking gun that lost us,

2747
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:46,680
the whole civilization.

2748
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:47,550
And I was just,

2749
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:47,661
uh,

2750
01:19:47,661 --> 01:19:48,720
yesterday I was,

2751
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,370
I was,

2752
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:49,480
uh,

2753
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:54,300
I've come here from North Carolina and
I sat down with Randall Carlson who has

2754
01:19:54,301 --> 01:19:54,541
been a,

2755
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:54,990
met him.

2756
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,100
You met Randall is very,

2757
01:19:56,101 --> 01:19:59,820
very fascinating man and he's been
working away quietly on this subject for

2758
01:19:59,821 --> 01:20:03,840
years and years and years long before
the evidence was in for a comment,

2759
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:05,880
he was predicting that
this is what caused it,

2760
01:20:05,881 --> 01:20:08,250
that there was a comment
impact and got this very,

2761
01:20:08,251 --> 01:20:09,420
very fascinating theory.

2762
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,190
And he's going to take me next year on a,

2763
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,300
on a field trip,

2764
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:12,750
uh,

2765
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:16,050
into the Pacific northwest
and into Canada to look at,

2766
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:21,000
to look at areas where there were these
massive outflows of floods from the ice

2767
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:21,780
cap.

2768
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:26,520
And what Randall is suggesting is that
that at least some large fragments of the

2769
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:30,810
comic that hit the Earth 12,980
years ago actually hit the ice cap.

2770
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,550
They landed on the ice cap,

2771
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:35,850
which was still in a mile
deep and they pulverize it.

2772
01:20:35,851 --> 01:20:39,150
They turned it into water immediately
and that's why you have these gigantic

2773
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:39,841
outburst floods,

2774
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:42,660
which carried down huge boulders
and strew them all over the,

2775
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,920
all over the landscape is a very,

2776
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,450
very exciting theory and it's,

2777
01:20:45,451 --> 01:20:48,570
and it's great to see Randall's work
being being vindicated because he's been

2778
01:20:48,571 --> 01:20:49,860
ignored for far too long.

2779
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:50,360
And I'm,

2780
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,790
I'm looking forward to doing a fascinating
field trip with him next next year.

2781
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:56,270
I met him in Georgia many years ago.

2782
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,640
The punchline comedy club had a long
and really interesting conversation

2783
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:03,360
conversation about him with him
rather about the Holocene comment.

2784
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:03,810
Yes.

2785
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:03,961
Well,

2786
01:21:03,961 --> 01:21:05,100
that's exactly what he's talking about.

2787
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:05,934
You see,

2788
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:06,271
he's,

2789
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:10,470
he's one of these guys who is just so
far ahead of his time that nobody saw it.

2790
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:10,950
Nobody,

2791
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,360
nobody realized what he was on.

2792
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:16,260
Now everybody understands that the earth
was hit by a comet and there's been a

2793
01:21:16,261 --> 01:21:19,620
big scientific argument about this
over the last five or six years,

2794
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:20,730
but it's really settled now.

2795
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:22,700
The evidence that the
all over the world is,

2796
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,420
is clear that this happened.

2797
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:27,990
But Randall was onto this years before
anybody else and what he's done,

2798
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,880
what he's also doing is just taking it,

2799
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:34,881
taking it that bit further because we
have these mysterious floods that occurred

2800
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,750
in precisely that period,

2801
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,390
which have traditionally
been called outburst floods.

2802
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:41,010
The idea was that,

2803
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,090
um,

2804
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:42,660
the,

2805
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:47,660
the ice caps gradually melting down filled
up these huge glacial lakes and that

2806
01:21:48,091 --> 01:21:51,420
eventually the ice dam in
closing the grace place,

2807
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:52,620
he'll lake would break.

2808
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:57,090
But now it looks like we're looking at
ice dams a thousand feet high in order to

2809
01:21:57,091 --> 01:21:59,400
account for the massive flow of water.

2810
01:21:59,401 --> 01:22:02,190
And what Randall suggesting is
that that theory is actually wrong.

2811
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,280
It wasn't the outburst
floods from Grace Hill legs.

2812
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:09,330
It was the comet hitting the ice cap
that turned all that ice to water and

2813
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:12,960
produce the gigantic gigantic
outflows carrying down boulders,

2814
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:13,471
you know,

2815
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:17,910
the size of houses and dumping
them over the landscapes and,

2816
01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:21,030
and then you have to consider anything
that lay in the way of those floods.

2817
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,720
Anything that lay in the path
of floods on that scale is gone,

2818
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:25,321
gone,

2819
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:27,270
completely wiped out from human memory.

2820
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:32,700
And you also have to consider the fact
that we absolutely know that these events

2821
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:34,800
have taken place in a much greater scale.

2822
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,530
Over the course of the earth
has been mass extinction events.

2823
01:22:37,531 --> 01:22:38,040
So this,

2824
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,600
this is not preposterous.

2825
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:40,680
There's not proposed to Roger.

2826
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:45,810
It's completely logical and it's time
that historians and archeologists

2827
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,970
abandoned the model that everything just
proceed smoothly and gently in the way

2828
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:53,370
that we've seen it doing for
the last few hundred years,

2829
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:55,690
which is called uniformitarianism and it,

2830
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:59,490
and embrace the thought that that
cataclysmic events are a key part of the

2831
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:00,390
history of the earth.

2832
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:00,681
And,

2833
01:23:00,681 --> 01:23:02,730
and we should know this already,

2834
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:04,680
there's massive amount of evidence for it.

2835
01:23:04,681 --> 01:23:05,080
It doesn't,

2836
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,410
it's not something we even need to argue
about by history proceeds on the basis

2837
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,690
that there is no such
thing as a cataclysm.

2838
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:11,651
In fact,

2839
01:23:11,651 --> 01:23:14,230
it's cataclysms that have written
the story of human history.

2840
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:14,551
Well,

2841
01:23:14,551 --> 01:23:15,301
not only that,

2842
01:23:15,301 --> 01:23:18,630
when you stop and look at all
the ancient stories of the epic,

2843
01:23:18,631 --> 01:23:19,411
of Gilgamesh,

2844
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,101
the Bible,

2845
01:23:20,101 --> 01:23:21,510
the flood of the art.

2846
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:22,111
Exactly.

2847
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:27,111
There's so many stories and involve
cataclysmic events about floods and

2848
01:23:27,121 --> 01:23:30,930
cataclysms the idea that those are
just fiction has kind of sits totally.

2849
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,140
He totally crazy and they
all say that this is a,

2850
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,290
that there was a golden age,

2851
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:38,490
that there was a former,

2852
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:40,630
that there was a former civilization that,

2853
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,210
that mankind had had,

2854
01:23:42,211 --> 01:23:46,770
had attained to a very high level
and then we angered the gods.

2855
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,000
It's often put that way.

2856
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:48,610
We,

2857
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:49,441
we angered the gods,

2858
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,240
we fell out of harmony with the universe.

2859
01:23:51,241 --> 01:23:51,811
There was,

2860
01:23:51,811 --> 01:23:52,260
um,

2861
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,310
something went wrong.

2862
01:23:53,311 --> 01:23:54,930
There was some kind of moral,

2863
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:55,141
yes,

2864
01:23:55,141 --> 01:23:55,351
please.

2865
01:23:55,351 --> 01:23:56,110
I would love some of that.

2866
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:56,943
This is Phil.

2867
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:57,390
Okay.

2868
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:57,920
That one,

2869
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,240
there was some kind of moral decline.

2870
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:00,840
Like now,

2871
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,650
like now,

2872
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:02,730
like now this is what I,

2873
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:03,150
what I,

2874
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:04,370
I often say that if,

2875
01:24:04,371 --> 01:24:08,670
if I were to look at our civilization
in myths and mythical terms,

2876
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,300
there's never been a civilization
that looked more like the next lost

2877
01:24:12,301 --> 01:24:13,410
civilization than ours.

2878
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:15,360
I don't want to spread gloom and doom.

2879
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,310
I don't believe in
spreading gloom and doom.

2880
01:24:17,311 --> 01:24:18,900
I think we should think positive.

2881
01:24:18,901 --> 01:24:19,770
And I have said earlier,

2882
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:19,911
and I,

2883
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:20,850
and I maintained this,

2884
01:24:20,851 --> 01:24:22,860
I'm very optimistic about
the future of the human race,

2885
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:25,800
but let's not pretend that
it's all roses in the garden.

2886
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:28,170
There's a terrible things are
happening in the world today.

2887
01:24:28,171 --> 01:24:33,090
We have an unbelievable
arrogance and unbelievable pride,

2888
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,170
cruelty,

2889
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:34,620
uh,

2890
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:34,870
that,

2891
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,011
uh,

2892
01:24:35,011 --> 01:24:39,330
an economic model that makes
millions mean countless millions,

2893
01:24:39,331 --> 01:24:40,350
incredibly poor,

2894
01:24:40,351 --> 01:24:41,460
and allows tiny,

2895
01:24:41,461 --> 01:24:43,170
tiny numbers to be incredibly,

2896
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:44,550
obscenely rich.

2897
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:45,151
Um,

2898
01:24:45,151 --> 01:24:45,421
and,

2899
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:45,671
and,

2900
01:24:45,671 --> 01:24:49,080
and the whole system is skewed
in the interest of that tiny,

2901
01:24:49,081 --> 01:24:51,120
tiny fraction of 1% of the wealthy.

2902
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:51,954
And unfortunately,

2903
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,460
it's really a,

2904
01:24:53,461 --> 01:24:53,620
as,

2905
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,440
as bad as it's possible to get in America.

2906
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,470
Um,

2907
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:58,380
it's just bad in many other countries too,

2908
01:24:58,381 --> 01:24:59,670
but it's really bad in America.

2909
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:01,650
The skewing of the skewing of wealth and,

2910
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:01,951
and,

2911
01:25:01,951 --> 01:25:05,130
and the brainwashing of the
population to keep people quiet,

2912
01:25:05,131 --> 01:25:08,130
to stop people thinking the mind
control operates in our society.

2913
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,330
It's like a pressure cooker.

2914
01:25:09,331 --> 01:25:10,110
Something's,

2915
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,130
something's got to give.

2916
01:25:11,131 --> 01:25:11,341
And,

2917
01:25:11,341 --> 01:25:11,760
and,

2918
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,000
and ours is a culture which is
literally destroying the earth.

2919
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:15,180
I,

2920
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,220
I the Amazon jungle,

2921
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:20,100
this amazing sacred realm,

2922
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:23,070
this incredible home of biodiversity,

2923
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:23,761
this,

2924
01:25:23,761 --> 01:25:26,160
this beautiful,

2925
01:25:26,161 --> 01:25:27,360
beautiful place.

2926
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:27,991
Uh,

2927
01:25:27,991 --> 01:25:29,700
the destruction that's taking place now,

2928
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:34,620
only a society that is truly
insane could allow that to happen.

2929
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,020
And that's unfortunately
our society today.

2930
01:25:37,021 --> 01:25:37,854
So we need to wake up

2931
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,690
and you want to talk about the
writing on the wall as far as a,

2932
01:25:41,691 --> 01:25:42,920
a powerful,

2933
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:45,740
advanced civilization being
completely wiped off the earth.

2934
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,560
How about our writing is
all going to the cloud.

2935
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:49,603
We have this,

2936
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:54,700
this crazy trend where everything is
going into these databases and hard drives

2937
01:25:55,191 --> 01:25:56,810
and when those are destroyed,

2938
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,610
there'll be nothing to hold on to.

2939
01:25:58,611 --> 01:25:59,900
Nothing to read.

2940
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,270
All of our knowledge will be memory.

2941
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:04,490
I mean it's almost ensuring

2942
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:08,220
that there will be nothing
remaining total wipe out this side.

2943
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,260
This idea that I've,

2944
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:11,090
that I've talked about
many times over the years,

2945
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:12,890
that we are a species with amnesia.

2946
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,820
We are going to be a species
with Amnesia because again,

2947
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,190
and our culture has not,

2948
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,150
has not at all looked at the,

2949
01:26:21,151 --> 01:26:22,160
at oral traditions,

2950
01:26:22,161 --> 01:26:23,660
we've destroyed the oral tradition.

2951
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:24,231
You know,

2952
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:28,460
we've put everything into the written
form now beamed it up into the cloud and

2953
01:26:28,461 --> 01:26:29,060
uh,

2954
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:29,893
one,

2955
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:30,980
one disaster.

2956
01:26:30,981 --> 01:26:31,760
It's all gone.

2957
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,430
And at least in a written
form you have books.

2958
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:34,970
Yeah.

2959
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:36,770
I mean we don't even have books anymore.

2960
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:37,783
We have,

2961
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,680
we have electronic updates.

2962
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:40,670
It's just,

2963
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:45,530
it's so crazy to think that all it takes
is one asteroidal impacts that wipes

2964
01:26:45,531 --> 01:26:47,480
out the grid and all that stuff's gone.

2965
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:48,030
All that stuff,

2966
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:49,580
he can't access it anymore.

2967
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:51,950
You have to rebuild the entire power grid.

2968
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,810
And if the future,

2969
01:26:53,811 --> 01:26:54,081
I mean,

2970
01:26:54,081 --> 01:26:56,150
if we lose one or two generations,

2971
01:26:56,151 --> 01:27:00,950
if we had a Holocene type incident again
or a big comment hit and wiped out 50%

2972
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:05,951
of the population and we had to Sorta
refigure out databases and refigure out

2973
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:06,884
hard drives,

2974
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:08,150
we're not going to,

2975
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:10,850
we're going to gather food and
we're gonna figure out agriculture.

2976
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,020
We're going to figure out some
real primitive ways to live life.

2977
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,110
But most of that stuff with three,

2978
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:16,820
four generations later is gone.

2979
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:17,480
It's gone,

2980
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,231
gone completely,

2981
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:19,064
completely gone.

2982
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:19,331
And,

2983
01:27:19,331 --> 01:27:19,611
and,

2984
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:19,980
and,

2985
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:20,813
um,

2986
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:24,660
I mean we have these gigantic
populations now based in cities where,

2987
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:25,250
where,

2988
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,000
um,

2989
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,280
actually the food supplies
incredibly fragile.

2990
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:32,510
It's like two or three days of food
is available at any city at any time.

2991
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:33,350
Um,

2992
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:36,680
consider the implications of that
if that supply chain breaks down.

2993
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,390
And we were very clear,

2994
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:39,110
we're on record now.

2995
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:40,550
Look what's just happened
in the Philippines.

2996
01:27:40,551 --> 01:27:41,240
Look at Hurricane,

2997
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,200
Hurricane Katrina.

2998
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,600
We cannot deal with natural disasters.

2999
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,401
Big One too,

3000
01:27:46,401 --> 01:27:46,641
man.

3001
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:47,421
That was a really,

3002
01:27:47,421 --> 01:27:52,421
really scary one that the Philippines
superstorm a storm the size of Germany,

3003
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:53,611
you know,

3004
01:27:53,611 --> 01:27:55,580
believable thousands,

3005
01:27:55,581 --> 01:27:58,270
10,000 more more people killed and,

3006
01:27:58,271 --> 01:28:00,020
and very slow reactions to do,

3007
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:00,920
to do anything about it.

3008
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:02,300
We have very bad human rights.

3009
01:28:02,301 --> 01:28:03,260
We could oldest tech,

3010
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,030
we got all this wealth,

3011
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:07,010
we got all this complacency.

3012
01:28:07,011 --> 01:28:08,570
But actually when,

3013
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,580
when the universe strikes us,

3014
01:28:10,581 --> 01:28:12,170
we are unable to do anything about it.

3015
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:12,630
And,

3016
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:14,990
and that's what's true in the
most wealthy country in the world.

3017
01:28:14,991 --> 01:28:16,880
In America as we saw
with Hurricane Katrina.

3018
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,930
And this is three times bigger than
three times bigger than countries.

3019
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:24,200
They showed some a city that was
200,000 people and there's not a single

3020
01:28:24,201 --> 01:28:25,280
structure left standing.

3021
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:25,850
Yeah,

3022
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:26,780
unbelievable.

3023
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:27,670
Just,

3024
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:28,520
and that,

3025
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:29,421
by the way,

3026
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:32,930
there have been bigger
ones had been bigger storms
throughout history than that.

3027
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:35,510
There's been bigger impacts
than the Holocene one.

3028
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:39,620
And the other thing about the
universe is that our orbit,

3029
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:43,160
like where we are is stable
and we have the moon,

3030
01:28:43,161 --> 01:28:44,750
which helps our orbit but be still,

3031
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:49,280
but there's hundreds of thousands of
near Earth objects that are just floating

3032
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:52,070
around out there that
could easily come down,

3033
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,450
collide into each other,

3034
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,680
slamming the earth.

3035
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:55,850
And that's a wrap.

3036
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,451
Absolutely.

3037
01:28:56,451 --> 01:28:56,661
This,

3038
01:28:56,661 --> 01:28:59,900
this again is something is something
that needs to be taken very,

3039
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:00,950
very seriously.

3040
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:01,531
Again,

3041
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:02,364
I want to say

3042
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,060
let's emphasize the positive and
let's emphasize positive thinking,

3043
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:08,010
but let's also be rational and reasonable.

3044
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:12,450
And when you look at the orbits of near
Earth Asteroids called Apollo objects,

3045
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:13,171
uh,

3046
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:18,171
it's like looking at a cat's cradle a of
harm that is surrounding this precious

3047
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:19,310
jewel of a,

3048
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:19,861
of a,

3049
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:20,520
of a planet.

3050
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,920
And we don't even know them all.

3051
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:23,130
We,

3052
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:24,440
we know a tiny fraction of them.

3053
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:28,110
What becomes clear is we only
know a little bit of these things.

3054
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:30,240
Some of them 10 miles wide,

3055
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,830
which are whinging through,

3056
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:32,250
uh,

3057
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:32,581
you know,

3058
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:33,760
outer space and,

3059
01:29:33,761 --> 01:29:35,130
and can hit us at any time.

3060
01:29:35,131 --> 01:29:36,060
And then comments,

3061
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:36,781
then comments,

3062
01:29:36,781 --> 01:29:37,060
some,

3063
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:37,380
some,

3064
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,990
some comments can have 12,000 year orbits.

3065
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:44,490
The suggestion that we're seeing a lot
of increased meteor activity as well

3066
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,360
right now,

3067
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:45,810
a lot of,

3068
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:47,130
a lot of action going on.

3069
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:48,211
And uh,

3070
01:29:48,211 --> 01:29:48,901
the suggestion,

3071
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:49,321
and again,

3072
01:29:49,321 --> 01:29:52,650
rather castle's work has been really
important in this area is the torrid.

3073
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:53,690
The tutorial,

3074
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:54,663
um,

3075
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:55,410
uh,

3076
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:56,790
asteroid or comet,

3077
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,100
the,

3078
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,450
the toric shower is a remains
of a disintegrated comment.

3079
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:03,690
And in that shower there
may be huge things,

3080
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:05,130
the size of cities which are,

3081
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,790
which are flowing through and crossing
the orbit of the earth regularly.

3082
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,730
It's not just pretty pretty
little lights in the sky.

3083
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:12,310
Uh,

3084
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,781
one day,

3085
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:14,580
one day we're going to run into something,

3086
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,230
something the size of New York,

3087
01:30:16,231 --> 01:30:16,501
you know,

3088
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:18,120
which is going to going to hit us.

3089
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:18,421
So that,

3090
01:30:18,421 --> 01:30:19,110
so this is,

3091
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:20,000
this is a matter of,

3092
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:20,191
for,

3093
01:30:20,191 --> 01:30:21,420
for care and concern and,

3094
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,291
and again,

3095
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,160
look what we do.

3096
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:23,521
You know,

3097
01:30:23,521 --> 01:30:24,001
we spent,

3098
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:27,690
we spend billions,

3099
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:27,750
trillions,

3100
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:28,650
limitless,

3101
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:33,120
endless amounts of money and inventing
new ways to destroy each other and very

3102
01:30:33,121 --> 01:30:34,690
little on actually looking at,

3103
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:35,524
on how to,

3104
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:36,930
how to protect the earth.

3105
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:39,420
Could they protect the earth
or from something like that?

3106
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:39,961
Well,

3107
01:30:39,961 --> 01:30:41,070
if we don't look into it,

3108
01:30:41,071 --> 01:30:42,870
we certainly won't have an
answer to that question.

3109
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:44,370
Some of them don't.

3110
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:48,060
They come from behind the sign and
we can't see them because of gravity.

3111
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,130
You can't see them come.

3112
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,320
They can't see them come back.

3113
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:51,710
But if the kind of,

3114
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,860
if the kind of focused scientific
effort that we're presently,

3115
01:30:54,861 --> 01:30:59,861
that is presently put into creating
weapons of mass destruction so that we can

3116
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:01,430
all fight each other.

3117
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:06,590
If that kind of effort we put into making
sure that we understand the orbit of

3118
01:31:06,591 --> 01:31:08,240
every single asteroid that's out there,

3119
01:31:08,241 --> 01:31:09,770
we identify them and find them,

3120
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:10,130
well,

3121
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:11,690
we'd be a lot safer than we are today.

3122
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:12,730
There's no profit in that.

3123
01:31:12,731 --> 01:31:16,360
Graham Hancock and [inaudible]
our corporates stockholders to do.

3124
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:17,921
That's ridiculous,

3125
01:31:17,921 --> 01:31:18,580
sir.

3126
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:18,840
Yeah.

3127
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,600
Yeah.

3128
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,770
It's almost mimics this
cyclical nature of life itself.

3129
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:28,240
It seems like civilization builds up to
this incredible point where it's like

3130
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:33,990
completely out of control and just
reckless and wild and then boom,

3131
01:31:34,481 --> 01:31:36,960
gets knocked down and
then builds back up again.

3132
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:38,260
And it's almost,

3133
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:42,460
I'm not suggesting that these things
floating around in space are there for a

3134
01:31:42,461 --> 01:31:43,210
reason,

3135
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:44,110
but if they were,

3136
01:31:44,111 --> 01:31:46,210
I mean it would be like
little reset buttons,

3137
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,380
a little reset buttons.

3138
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:48,220
I mean,

3139
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:50,220
maybe that's what happened
when the dinosaurs got it,

3140
01:31:50,221 --> 01:31:51,054
got to a fly the,

3141
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:52,830
that's why the ancient mythology,

3142
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:57,420
which consistently says right or wrong,

3143
01:31:57,421 --> 01:32:02,170
consistently says that
mankind is implicated in these
cataclysms our behavior,

3144
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:07,150
our wickedness is implicated
in this in some way.

3145
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:09,550
I think it's worth listening
to that a little bit and,

3146
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:09,920
and,

3147
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,960
and you know,

3148
01:32:10,961 --> 01:32:12,580
maybe maybe this,

3149
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:12,940
this,

3150
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:15,220
this time we don't have
to go through the reset.

3151
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:15,641
Maybe.

3152
01:32:15,641 --> 01:32:19,630
Maybe it's possible for mankind to
actually wake up now that we are globally

3153
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:22,870
connected now that we do have this
possibility of all talking to one another

3154
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:24,130
before it's too late,

3155
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,790
we can reset ourselves
in a positive direction.

3156
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:31,360
I feel like the only way we would
as if we knew something was coming,

3157
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,160
I think that's almost the only way.

3158
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:36,070
And we would have to be informed and
then we would have to believe it.

3159
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:39,460
And then there would be disputes and I'm
sure the Republicans would start laughs

3160
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:40,150
nonsense.

3161
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:43,030
We're a show you right here at the
same scientist that brought you climate

3162
01:32:43,031 --> 01:32:46,360
change are telling you right now and
there's an asteroid hitting our rank.

3163
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:47,171
Certainly they would.

3164
01:32:47,171 --> 01:32:47,530
They would.

3165
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:49,420
They would say that she
just is going to protect us.

3166
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:53,680
What we need to do is cut
taxes for corporations and
ensure that we can move to

3167
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:55,090
Mexico and when our factories.

3168
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,110
Yeah,

3169
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:57,100
I wonder,

3170
01:32:57,130 --> 01:33:00,520
I wonder if we would really pay attention
if we knew that we had a year left.

3171
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:02,380
If we had a year ago and they'd get that.

3172
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,100
Think of that.

3173
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:03,860
What a difference.

3174
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:05,740
What a situation that would be.

3175
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:06,460
Think of that.

3176
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,050
We barely pay attention
to what we're doing.

3177
01:33:08,051 --> 01:33:09,040
That's really obvious.

3178
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:12,490
Like the polluting of the ocean
or the the destroying of the,

3179
01:33:12,491 --> 01:33:12,731
the,

3180
01:33:12,731 --> 01:33:13,120
the,

3181
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,240
the pulling s.

3182
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:18,250
There's the fish out of the ocean and
the alarming rate that doesn't allow them

3183
01:33:18,251 --> 01:33:19,600
to recover insane.

3184
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,910
All of it about the pursuit
of short term profits,

3185
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,850
all of it about immediate payoffs.

3186
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,780
Nobody,

3187
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,250
nobody thinking long term.

3188
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:28,061
Again,

3189
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:29,140
I come back to this.

3190
01:33:29,141 --> 01:33:32,230
We are a deranged society and,

3191
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:37,290
and a little nodes of sanity are
beginning to wake up all around the world,

3192
01:33:37,691 --> 01:33:38,670
but maybe it's not,

3193
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,670
not in enough time.

3194
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:40,563
And isn't that,

3195
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,170
doesn't it also go back to what you
were saying about psychedelics and how

3196
01:33:44,171 --> 01:33:49,171
beneficial psychedelics can be because
one of the main themes of Iowasca is save

3197
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:49,960
the planet.

3198
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:50,441
It's safe.

3199
01:33:50,441 --> 01:33:50,860
The planet.

3200
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:52,810
It's a universal theme of Iowasca.

3201
01:33:52,811 --> 01:33:53,770
Sooner or later,

3202
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:57,520
anybody who works with Iowasca enough is
going to start picking up that message

3203
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:00,280
that this beautiful earth,

3204
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:00,881
that we have,

3205
01:34:00,881 --> 01:34:03,010
this gift that the universe has given us,

3206
01:34:03,011 --> 01:34:05,410
his precious beyond measure,

3207
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:10,390
precious beyond imagination and that
we are part of it and that we must,

3208
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:14,660
we must treat it with love and respect
and reverence rather than in the,

3209
01:34:14,661 --> 01:34:15,880
in the horrific way that we do.

3210
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:19,390
And that part of treating the planet
with love and respect and reverence is

3211
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:22,240
treating fellow human beings with love
and respect and reference at every,

3212
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:22,811
at every level.

3213
01:34:22,811 --> 01:34:24,930
This is a very strong message of Iowa.

3214
01:34:24,931 --> 01:34:25,161
Ask.

3215
01:34:25,161 --> 01:34:25,930
It is a message.

3216
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:27,640
It is fundamentally a message of love,

3217
01:34:27,641 --> 01:34:28,840
not in a wishy washy way,

3218
01:34:28,841 --> 01:34:33,100
but in a really firm and clear way that
that is the salvation of the human race.

3219
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:33,431
There's,

3220
01:34:33,431 --> 01:34:34,091
Bill Hicks said it,

3221
01:34:34,091 --> 01:34:34,361
you know,

3222
01:34:34,361 --> 01:34:36,400
the love is the opposite of fear.

3223
01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:36,731
Fear.

3224
01:34:36,731 --> 01:34:39,370
Fear is what is what
presses are buttons today.

3225
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:41,890
It's what's used deliberately
depress our buttons.

3226
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,191
And,

3227
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:43,950
and what's the opposite of that is,

3228
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:44,740
is love.

3229
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:45,573
That's what we need.

3230
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:47,470
And then Bill Hicks
did a lot of mushrooms.

3231
01:34:47,471 --> 01:34:50,800
Fox and Bill Hicks did a lot of
mushrooms and what a brilliant,

3232
01:34:50,801 --> 01:34:51,820
brilliant man he was.

3233
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:52,271
Oh yeah.

3234
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:53,530
He's one of my comedy heroes.

3235
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:53,860
Yeah,

3236
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,693
for sure.

3237
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:58,010
There's a 19 year old inventor
who found a way to clean up

3238
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,920
the world's ocean in
under five years time.

3239
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:01,950
Um,

3240
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:02,630
he,

3241
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,880
he this great Pacific garbage patch.

3242
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:07,310
This young kid has figured out this,

3243
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,520
this machine that would a absorb all
the plastic material in the ocean.

3244
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:16,220
Really fascinating stuff.

3245
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,210
Um,

3246
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:17,661
there's a,

3247
01:35:17,661 --> 01:35:19,040
there's an article about it,

3248
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:19,670
uh,

3249
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:20,140
on,

3250
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:20,900
uh,

3251
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,840
this is VR dashed zone.com.

3252
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:25,880
But I'm sure if you do
a Google search on that,

3253
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:29,930
you can find several different
sites that have covered that,

3254
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:35,230
but it's like this is a machine that
would essentially sit in the center of the

3255
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:38,210
ocean and start sucking
all the plastic up.

3256
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,800
We have a huge,

3257
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:40,191
huge,

3258
01:35:40,191 --> 01:35:41,510
huge problem with this.

3259
01:35:41,511 --> 01:35:45,170
This plastic in the ocean is something
that no one even considered until roughly

3260
01:35:45,171 --> 01:35:49,490
a decade or so ago when they started
being aware that all the stuff that were

3261
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:50,260
littering on,

3262
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:50,440
Eh,

3263
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:50,901
you know,

3264
01:35:50,901 --> 01:35:53,960
whether it's throwing off a boat or
just finds its way to the ocean through

3265
01:35:53,961 --> 01:35:55,400
drainage pipes or what have you,

3266
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:57,290
we're dealing with a massive,

3267
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:02,291
massive amount of material and material
that's not biodegradable that's being

3268
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:07,840
turned into like this sludgy sort of
shitty stuff that's floating around.

3269
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,670
There's a kind of symbol of everything
that's wrong without culture actually.

3270
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:11,121
Yeah,

3271
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:12,510
it really is and it's,

3272
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:16,070
and a bed bed is this guy's idea
going to be taken up as well.

3273
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:16,581
Hopefully.

3274
01:36:16,581 --> 01:36:16,761
I mean,

3275
01:36:16,761 --> 01:36:18,920
it's pretty amazing that
this 19 year old kid,

3276
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:19,754
well my,

3277
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:24,950
the point being that what
I find fascinating is that
when our back is up against

3278
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:25,761
the wall,

3279
01:36:25,761 --> 01:36:26,600
like when someone realizes,

3280
01:36:26,601 --> 01:36:27,081
oh my God,

3281
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:27,914
we have this,

3282
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:29,910
this country sized patch of,

3283
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:33,440
of plastic that's floating
around in the ocean.

3284
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:34,010
Yeah.

3285
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:35,450
When your back is up against the wall,

3286
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:37,190
people start thinking when
people start thinking,

3287
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:37,971
they start innovating,

3288
01:36:37,971 --> 01:36:39,800
when they started innovating
solutions come about.

3289
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:41,570
And maybe even a solution when they say,

3290
01:36:41,571 --> 01:36:41,721
hey,

3291
01:36:41,721 --> 01:36:42,500
you know what,

3292
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,660
that plastic is actually,

3293
01:36:44,661 --> 01:36:48,140
you could turn that into
stuff that actually could be
used as fuel that actually

3294
01:36:48,141 --> 01:36:51,680
could be used to create things that
actually could be used in a beneficial way

3295
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:52,550
that,

3296
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:55,970
but then the problem is going to be how
do you keep people from continuing the

3297
01:36:55,971 --> 01:36:59,060
same process and re polluting it
again once you've cleaned it up.

3298
01:36:59,090 --> 01:36:59,660
Yup.

3299
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:00,050
Yup.

3300
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:00,883
Psychedelics.

3301
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:01,350
Yeah.

3302
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:02,360
It won't be the only way.

3303
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,540
The,

3304
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:02,791
the,

3305
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:06,110
the realization that the huge
kick up the ass that comes with,

3306
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:06,350
uh,

3307
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:06,620
with,

3308
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:09,800
with a major responsibly
taken psychedelic journey.

3309
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:13,850
And then there's also the challenge
of our current trend in these gigantic

3310
01:37:13,851 --> 01:37:17,060
cities and these gigantic
cities aren't sustainable.

3311
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:18,800
They're not agriculturally sustainable,

3312
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:20,000
sustainable.

3313
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:21,200
So like how do you,

3314
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:21,660
how do you,

3315
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:26,090
how do you figure out a way to stop
the trend of these gigantic cities or

3316
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:29,880
provide food or figure
out a way to be in a,

3317
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:34,910
in a sustainable environment and still
have modern conveniences and technology

3318
01:37:35,121 --> 01:37:36,140
and medicine and all those,

3319
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:37,110
you know,

3320
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:37,943
very difficult,

3321
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:38,481
very,

3322
01:37:38,481 --> 01:37:40,520
very difficult problem if possible,

3323
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:41,640
how to solve.

3324
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:45,890
But I'd like all of these gigantic
problems if we begin to solve them at a

3325
01:37:45,891 --> 01:37:46,641
personal level,

3326
01:37:46,641 --> 01:37:48,980
within our own sphere of influence within,

3327
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:51,990
within where we live in our
relationships with other human beings.

3328
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:52,824
So that's a good start.

3329
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,141
That's,

3330
01:37:53,141 --> 01:37:54,290
that's where we do have power.

3331
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:55,170
That's where we do have choice.

3332
01:37:55,171 --> 01:37:56,040
We cannot change the

3333
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,520
world,

3334
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:57,353
any one of us,

3335
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,640
but we can change the way
we interact with others.

3336
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:00,271
Yeah.

3337
01:38:00,271 --> 01:38:04,110
And it seems like that's probably the
best way to fix this whole masses.

3338
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:08,130
To fix it on a macro
scale or a micro scale.

3339
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:08,740
Micro scale.

3340
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:09,180
Yeah.

3341
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:14,180
Fix it in individuals and
spread it like a virus spread.

3342
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:17,820
This new found realization
of what we're really doing,

3343
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:19,350
what our impact really is,

3344
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:24,320
the awareness and this
sort of new found idea of,

3345
01:38:24,321 --> 01:38:29,160
of connectivity that we have and that
we're starting to grasp a hold up because

3346
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:30,150
of this internet culture,

3347
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:32,190
because of this new area,

3348
01:38:32,191 --> 01:38:33,870
this new new new area in history,

3349
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:34,704
this guy,

3350
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,170
this new level of a,

3351
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:36,700
of admission.

3352
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:36,890
That's,

3353
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:37,130
that's,

3354
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:37,530
that's,

3355
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,580
that's where it's happening.

3356
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:39,361
And,

3357
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:40,110
and that's,

3358
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,910
that's where I take hope,

3359
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,241
you know,

3360
01:38:42,241 --> 01:38:42,701
because I,

3361
01:38:42,701 --> 01:38:45,090
I meet young people every
time I go out and give a,

3362
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:45,570
give a,

3363
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:46,141
give a lecture,

3364
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:46,411
give it,

3365
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:47,244
give a talk,

3366
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,210
I meet,

3367
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:51,390
I meet young people who have come there
and they are thinking in a new way,

3368
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:51,930
you know,

3369
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:56,730
the old ideas of nationalism
and patriotism and all
that bullshit have gone.

3370
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,500
These are people who are
thinking in terms of,

3371
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:00,030
of humanity as a whole.

3372
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:00,361
And,

3373
01:39:00,361 --> 01:39:00,640
and,

3374
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:00,881
and,

3375
01:39:00,881 --> 01:39:04,890
and thinking in terms of what a glorious
gift the universe has given us with

3376
01:39:04,891 --> 01:39:05,431
this planet.

3377
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:06,810
And we have to live right there.

3378
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:09,090
There is a tremendous
spirit in the world today.

3379
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:09,361
Well,

3380
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:13,920
one of the benefits of travel is that
travel sort of erodes the idea of

3381
01:39:13,921 --> 01:39:16,860
nationalism in a way where you meet
these people in these other countries and

3382
01:39:16,861 --> 01:39:18,110
you realize well they're just like me.

3383
01:39:18,111 --> 01:39:22,080
Just like they mean they might talk in a
different accent or a speak a different

3384
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:22,411
language,

3385
01:39:22,411 --> 01:39:23,280
but they're just people.

3386
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:28,670
And I think one of the reasons why people
have nationalism is based on a fear of

3387
01:39:29,491 --> 01:39:30,510
those other people.

3388
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:30,991
Again,

3389
01:39:30,991 --> 01:39:34,350
fear is the theme and fear and this
is fear that can be manipulated,

3390
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:38,670
that the powers that that run the
world at the moment are deliberately

3391
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:41,610
manipulating all the time to divide us
from one another and prevent us from

3392
01:39:41,611 --> 01:39:42,270
realizing.

3393
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:46,320
And amongst those powers are of course
all of the big states and government

3394
01:39:46,321 --> 01:39:49,050
apparatus and are of course
all of the big religions,

3395
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,071
Christianity,

3396
01:39:50,071 --> 01:39:52,710
Judaism and Islam are all in
the theater business as well.

3397
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:56,040
They're all in generating fear and
telling us that this is the only way to do

3398
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:58,020
things and we are
different and this is the,

3399
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,930
this is the right way to do things of
that is the wrong way to do things.

3400
01:40:00,931 --> 01:40:02,250
And that's the old model.

3401
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:02,741
Uh,

3402
01:40:02,741 --> 01:40:03,840
the big corporations,

3403
01:40:03,841 --> 01:40:04,740
they are part of that too.

3404
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:05,100
You know,

3405
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,240
you have to rely on us.

3406
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,650
We will be the answer to
your all your problems.

3407
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:09,300
Such bullshit.

3408
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:10,320
That's the old model.

3409
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:11,250
And that's the,

3410
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:14,910
that's the model that is bit by
bit day by day one step at a time,

3411
01:40:14,911 --> 01:40:16,740
one brick at a time getting replaced.

3412
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:17,820
It's really is isn't it?

3413
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:18,101
And the,

3414
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:18,301
the,

3415
01:40:18,301 --> 01:40:22,260
the model of government itself is a
giant chunk of fear with a little bit of

3416
01:40:22,261 --> 01:40:23,094
hope.

3417
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:26,190
And the hope is all lies.

3418
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,020
No hope is all silly.

3419
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:31,590
I mean the hope is basically bullshit
provided by corporations so they can keep

3420
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:32,390
fracking.

3421
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:32,710
You know,

3422
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:33,510
it's like,

3423
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:34,060
yeah,

3424
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:34,410
the,

3425
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:34,751
the,

3426
01:40:34,751 --> 01:40:36,660
I honestly thought fracking,

3427
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:36,991
you know?

3428
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:37,500
Yeah.

3429
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:38,333
All fear,

3430
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,353
all fear,

3431
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:39,930
fear,

3432
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:40,980
fear generated.

3433
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:41,510
Um,

3434
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:41,700
and,

3435
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:42,040
and,

3436
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,290
and this is what we,

3437
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:45,360
what we need to move beyond government.

3438
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:49,240
I think the way we've known it for
the last centuries on the way it,

3439
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:50,310
what it's come to today,

3440
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:50,880
it's done,

3441
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:51,421
it's over.

3442
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:52,540
It's stories over it.

3443
01:40:52,541 --> 01:40:53,374
It's hanging.

3444
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:54,250
It's fucking

3445
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,560
everything up as badly as it can.

3446
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:57,663
But it is done.

3447
01:40:57,670 --> 01:40:58,150
That is,

3448
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:02,440
that is a model that will no longer work
and whether or not it wants to or not,

3449
01:41:02,441 --> 01:41:04,510
it will slowly be phased out.

3450
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,710
I think that when you're,

3451
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:06,640
when you're talking about it,

3452
01:41:06,641 --> 01:41:10,090
what's interesting that I think that
the very practices that it's using right

3453
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:14,360
now that our government is using
are going to aid its own demise.

3454
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,760
The practices of the NSA
monitoring everybody's email and,

3455
01:41:17,761 --> 01:41:19,790
and constantly spying on Americans.

3456
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:23,980
So ridiculous socially where people
are just like completely up in arms and

3457
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:24,790
upset about it.

3458
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:29,650
But also that technological trend
is going to lead to ultimate truth.

3459
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:33,160
And that's a real issue
with the government because
the government relies on

3460
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:36,280
deception and bullshit and bribery
and special interest groups.

3461
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:37,114
Absolutely.

3462
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:37,651
Absolutely.

3463
01:41:37,651 --> 01:41:39,910
They can't keep that up if
you have ultimate truth,

3464
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:43,280
ultimate access to information
and the boundaries between people,

3465
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:44,770
that information are all gone.

3466
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:45,220
Yeah.

3467
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:46,360
How are you going to run a country?

3468
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:46,810
Yeah.

3469
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:47,111
The sow,

3470
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:48,980
the seeds of their own destruction are,

3471
01:41:48,981 --> 01:41:52,060
are already planted in the
mechanisms they're putting in place.

3472
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:52,421
Yeah.

3473
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:53,890
It's like it's,

3474
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:54,813
they can't,

3475
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:56,710
it's like if you ever seen,

3476
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:57,160
um,

3477
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:57,651
there's a,

3478
01:41:57,651 --> 01:42:01,060
a method of hunting walls that the
Eskimos use where they would take a very

3479
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:04,960
sharp knife and put it in the ground and
put blood on the knife and a wolf would

3480
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:08,560
come along and start to lick the knife
because of the blood on the knife,

3481
01:42:08,561 --> 01:42:12,790
taste his own blood and continued to lick
and bite the blade and bleed to death.

3482
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:13,680
I didn't know that.

3483
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,250
That's a story that actually happens.

3484
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:15,820
Oh yeah.

3485
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,061
Yeah.

3486
01:42:16,061 --> 01:42:17,170
It's a method that they,

3487
01:42:17,171 --> 01:42:17,461
the,

3488
01:42:17,461 --> 01:42:20,620
the nun people devised of hunting roles,

3489
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,810
they would plant these knives in the ice
and that's what our government's does.

3490
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:25,430
Exactly.

3491
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:25,840
They're there.

3492
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,270
They're licking their own blood
and they don't even realize it.

3493
01:42:28,271 --> 01:42:28,871
But these things,

3494
01:42:28,871 --> 01:42:30,910
like the perfect example is,

3495
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,750
I don't know if you know the story in
our country of General Petraeus who was

3496
01:42:34,751 --> 01:42:35,920
the head of the CIA,

3497
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:39,370
was exposed through the head of the CIA.

3498
01:42:39,371 --> 01:42:39,750
Is that,

3499
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:42,880
that's supposedly the number
one spy in the country,

3500
01:42:42,881 --> 01:42:43,151
right?

3501
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:43,984
That's the head.

3502
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:44,680
Well,

3503
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:45,700
he he was,

3504
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:50,790
he was fired because it was exposed that
he was having an affair and that affair

3505
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:54,100
x fair was a s exposed
through email exchanges.

3506
01:42:54,101 --> 01:42:54,400
Right.

3507
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,070
When the FBI examined the CIA,

3508
01:42:57,490 --> 01:43:02,490
the FBI is ratting on the CIA and getting
rid of the number one CIA guy through

3509
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:04,413
email,

3510
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,610
through a transparency
and email exchanges.

3511
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:07,781
Absolutely.

3512
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:08,930
Completely fascinating.

3513
01:43:08,931 --> 01:43:09,320
It is.

3514
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,220
It is because it's that this is the,

3515
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:15,240
this is the main government
entity that's involved in spine,

3516
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:16,031
you know,

3517
01:43:16,031 --> 01:43:17,890
other than the NSA and it's just,

3518
01:43:17,891 --> 01:43:20,680
it all like you guys are
going to get exposed to,

3519
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:23,440
everyone's going to get exposed
is getting exposed and the,

3520
01:43:23,441 --> 01:43:26,590
the real problem isn't in affairs.

3521
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:28,690
I mean affairs are obviously are an issue,

3522
01:43:28,691 --> 01:43:33,610
but the real problem is going to be in
the structure of power itself and what

3523
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:38,080
the influence is so clearly
exposed the influence,

3524
01:43:38,081 --> 01:43:40,330
whether it's a special interest
groups of corporations,

3525
01:43:40,331 --> 01:43:41,470
of lobbyists,

3526
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,371
whatever it is,

3527
01:43:42,371 --> 01:43:46,930
when it's so clearly exposed
that it cannot be tolerated
by rational people bear

3528
01:43:46,931 --> 01:43:47,530
it anymore.

3529
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,840
There's this growing
anger about all of this.

3530
01:43:49,841 --> 01:43:50,720
This is what the what the,

3531
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:52,190
the in the people

3532
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,510
in big government who are,

3533
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,690
who are advocating this
continual surveillance and
invasion of our privacy in

3534
01:43:57,691 --> 01:43:57,920
every,

3535
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,580
in every possible way.

3536
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:00,740
They're not getting the anger in society.

3537
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:03,530
People like just not prepared to
put up with this shit any longer.

3538
01:44:03,531 --> 01:44:07,310
And I think it's a great thing because
I think there's nothing wrong with

3539
01:44:07,311 --> 01:44:07,941
government.

3540
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:10,970
There's nothing wrong with having a mayor.

3541
01:44:10,971 --> 01:44:12,530
There's nothing wrong
with having a president.

3542
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:16,940
There's nothing wrong with police as long
as everyone's honest and rational and

3543
01:44:16,941 --> 01:44:18,470
ethical truth is the key.

3544
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:21,020
And they'll be forced to do that.

3545
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:24,770
It's not like we're advocating that the
government needs to be destroyed and

3546
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:26,540
anarchy nonsense.

3547
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:27,680
We want honest government,

3548
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,270
completely truth possible.

3549
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:31,810
And if it's forced then then,

3550
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:32,660
then it's forced.

3551
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:37,190
But if it's forced because of technology
and innovation instead of some crazy

3552
01:44:37,191 --> 01:44:39,140
radical violent revolution,

3553
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:40,520
it's just as powerful,

3554
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:41,660
just as powerful to change.

3555
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:42,080
In fact,

3556
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,000
California and undeniable,

3557
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:44,510
yeah.

3558
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:46,730
Can't just build up a wall
to keep the Internet out.

3559
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:47,240
No,

3560
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:47,970
no,

3561
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:48,410
no.

3562
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:48,771
Definitely.

3563
01:44:48,771 --> 01:44:49,880
Definitely not know the truth.

3564
01:44:49,881 --> 01:44:51,260
The truth is the truth is key.

3565
01:44:51,261 --> 01:44:51,951
This is what matters.

3566
01:44:51,951 --> 01:44:54,350
And also also those who go,

3567
01:44:54,351 --> 01:44:54,620
who,

3568
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,020
who go into into government.

3569
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:58,971
They shouldn't be,

3570
01:44:58,971 --> 01:45:01,730
they shouldn't be this huge status
and power associated with it.

3571
01:45:01,731 --> 01:45:02,001
You know?

3572
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:02,241
It's a,

3573
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:02,520
it's a,

3574
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:03,290
it's a mistake.

3575
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:03,861
It should be.

3576
01:45:03,861 --> 01:45:04,551
It should be done.

3577
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:08,230
It should be the person who
doesn't want to go into government.

3578
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:09,560
That's the person who
should be in government.

3579
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:10,551
Yeah.

3580
01:45:10,551 --> 01:45:12,710
It's unfortunate that that is how,

3581
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,080
how it's been for a long time.

3582
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:16,720
It's the people that should,

3583
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,900
shouldn't be president of the
ones that want to be present.

3584
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,930
It's been that way for a long time.

3585
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,800
Give them Iowasca.

3586
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:26,570
I would hope and I would hope
also that the trend is moving.

3587
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:26,781
I mean,

3588
01:45:26,781 --> 01:45:30,380
if you go back to these people that we're
talking about that existed these pre

3589
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,080
humans that existed 1.8 million years ago,

3590
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:35,060
and the way they conducted each other,

3591
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:36,170
conducted their lives,

3592
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:40,010
and then look at how we conduct our
lives in 2013 it's been a massive,

3593
01:45:40,011 --> 01:45:43,640
incredible amount of progress
and understanding each
other that this trend will

3594
01:45:43,641 --> 01:45:47,060
continue and if we don't get
hit by some kind of giant media,

3595
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:52,080
that we will ultimately reach a level
of understanding that will sort of make

3596
01:45:54,591 --> 01:45:55,221
this happen.

3597
01:45:55,221 --> 01:45:57,400
Whether or not psychedelics
are involved or not,

3598
01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:57,671
that we'll,

3599
01:45:57,671 --> 01:45:59,240
we'll just reach this level.

3600
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:00,103
As I say,

3601
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:01,130
it's happening.

3602
01:46:01,131 --> 01:46:01,611
It's happening,

3603
01:46:01,611 --> 01:46:02,540
it's happening now.

3604
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:05,390
It's interesting that
psychedelics are a catalyst in it.

3605
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:05,900
Um,

3606
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:06,131
the,

3607
01:46:06,131 --> 01:46:06,371
the,

3608
01:46:06,371 --> 01:46:10,040
the come up again and again in the
conversation and what it boils down to is

3609
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:10,580
the,

3610
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,391
the recognition,

3611
01:46:11,391 --> 01:46:13,800
and I've been banging on about
this for a long time there,

3612
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:14,660
the recognition of,

3613
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:18,650
of the adult sovereign individual that
we have a right to explore our own

3614
01:46:18,651 --> 01:46:19,280
consciousness.

3615
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:24,280
That is a grotesque invasion of our
privacy and our sovereignty over our own

3616
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:26,150
bodies that a government would,

3617
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:30,920
would even have the temerity to suggest
that it's got a right to punish us for

3618
01:46:30,921 --> 01:46:31,630
doing that.

3619
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:31,980
This,

3620
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:32,930
this is the,

3621
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:35,330
it's not the issue of the
psychedelics themselves.

3622
01:46:35,331 --> 01:46:38,870
It's the issue of the right
to make sovereign decisions
about our own bodies and

3623
01:46:38,871 --> 01:46:39,651
our own consciousness.

3624
01:46:39,651 --> 01:46:39,981
And this,

3625
01:46:39,981 --> 01:46:42,650
I see a big awakening all
over the world taking place,

3626
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:43,940
Litmus test.

3627
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:44,571
I agree.

3628
01:46:44,571 --> 01:46:45,021
And it's,

3629
01:46:45,021 --> 01:46:48,690
it's one of those things where we're
going to look back on through history and

3630
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,310
the way we look at the inquisition,

3631
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:54,000
the way we look at burning witches were
we're going to look at the prosecution

3632
01:46:54,001 --> 01:46:55,320
of people for using psychedelics.

3633
01:46:55,321 --> 01:46:58,350
And it's just as ridiculous
with horror as a,

3634
01:46:58,351 --> 01:46:58,741
as a,

3635
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:02,490
as a horrific episode when human
society made terrible mistakes.

3636
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:05,820
Your book supernatural
is a fascinating book.

3637
01:47:05,821 --> 01:47:06,840
I really enjoyed that.

3638
01:47:06,841 --> 01:47:08,930
And that details the,

3639
01:47:08,931 --> 01:47:13,931
the concept of human beings learning
from psychedelic experiences and actually

3640
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:19,800
it giving birth to a new level of
creativity and a new level of culture.

3641
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:21,090
I believe that,

3642
01:47:21,091 --> 01:47:21,331
uh,

3643
01:47:21,331 --> 01:47:22,260
that there's,

3644
01:47:22,261 --> 01:47:26,310
there's no doubt that psychedelics have
played a huge unrecognized role in the

3645
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:26,941
human story.

3646
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:29,850
And I want to pay tribute to Terence
Mckenna for being one of the early people

3647
01:47:29,851 --> 01:47:31,020
to recognize that again,

3648
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:31,950
in so many ways,

3649
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,090
Terence mckenna,

3650
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:35,220
just an incredible genius,

3651
01:47:35,570 --> 01:47:35,790
uh,

3652
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:37,230
that stoned ape theory that,

3653
01:47:37,231 --> 01:47:37,500
that,

3654
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:37,770
that,

3655
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:40,050
that he came up with is
absolutely key to this.

3656
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:40,381
And again,

3657
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:43,410
he was far ahead of his time
academics followed behind him in this,

3658
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:48,800
in this that we need to recognize that
these demonized plants have played a huge

3659
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:51,270
role in the human story.

3660
01:47:51,271 --> 01:47:53,130
Just in my recent
travels in South America,

3661
01:47:53,131 --> 01:47:55,980
I was in a place called corral a 200,

3662
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:59,820
200 kilometers north of Lima in Peru.

3663
01:47:59,930 --> 01:48:00,390
Um,

3664
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:01,920
now back in the 90s,

3665
01:48:01,921 --> 01:48:03,450
people were saying that there was no,

3666
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:07,350
that could be no relationship between
old world pyramids and New World Pyramids

3667
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,720
because all the pyramids in the
new world were much younger.

3668
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:14,610
That story is now gone as a result of
chorale and another site ban Doria in

3669
01:48:14,611 --> 01:48:14,971
Peru,

3670
01:48:14,971 --> 01:48:19,230
which are definitively 2,500 to 3000 BC,

3671
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:21,150
the same date that is put on the,

3672
01:48:21,151 --> 01:48:22,620
the Great Pyramids of Giza.

3673
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,500
And what's fascinating at
Caroll is a couple of things.

3674
01:48:25,501 --> 01:48:26,310
Firstly,

3675
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:30,810
there was a big city complex there 5,000
years ago and absolutely no evidence of

3676
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:31,920
warfare whatsoever.

3677
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:33,930
It was traditionally it was believed that,

3678
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:34,340
you know,

3679
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:39,240
the evolution of cities was connected
with warfare in some way that people came

3680
01:48:39,241 --> 01:48:41,280
in to cities to protect
themselves from war.

3681
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,450
No warfare,

3682
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:43,290
none whatsoever.

3683
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,460
These people did not make war.

3684
01:48:44,461 --> 01:48:44,911
Secondly,

3685
01:48:44,911 --> 01:48:46,140
they were using psychedelics,

3686
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,070
um,

3687
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:48,540
quite clear evidence of this.

3688
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:48,990
Uh,

3689
01:48:48,990 --> 01:48:49,980
so you know,

3690
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:54,750
this unexamined part of the human story
needs to be brought back into prominence

3691
01:48:54,751 --> 01:48:58,590
and we need to realize we owe a lot to
the visionary plants and we're making a

3692
01:48:58,591 --> 01:49:00,870
mistake to create a
society that seeks to cut,

3693
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:04,920
cut us off from that source of
learning and that source of teaching.

3694
01:49:04,921 --> 01:49:08,040
It's not an accident in the Amazon
that they call these plants teachers.

3695
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:08,970
They are teachers.

3696
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:11,900
And I think it's also
very fascinating that the,

3697
01:49:11,901 --> 01:49:15,420
the academic world has in many ways,

3698
01:49:15,421 --> 01:49:15,810
in many ways,

3699
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:18,900
especially the older academic world
that grew up without the internet,

3700
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:22,890
has turned their back on the concept
of psychedelics being beneficial to the

3701
01:49:22,891 --> 01:49:26,370
point where it's laughed at and Poo
pooed to the point where it Mckenna's

3702
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:27,200
Psychedelic,

3703
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,150
a stoned ape theory is if
you don't know the theory,

3704
01:49:30,151 --> 01:49:33,180
his theory involves the
evolution of humans,

3705
01:49:33,181 --> 01:49:36,930
the doubling of the human brain size
directly related to the consumption of

3706
01:49:36,931 --> 01:49:37,890
psychedelic mushrooms.

3707
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,780
It's an incredibly controversial theory,

3708
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:42,270
but when I had Dennis
Mckenna on the podcast,

3709
01:49:42,271 --> 01:49:47,271
Dennis explained it in a very scientific
way that would show how the psych,

3710
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:48,010
the

3711
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,370
consumption of psychedelic mushrooms
would correlate with the creating of

3712
01:49:51,371 --> 01:49:52,204
language,

3713
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:53,740
with the expansion of consciousness.

3714
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:54,370
It's,

3715
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:59,370
it's an incredibly intricate and detailed
idea that's completely ignored by so

3716
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:01,630
many mainstream people,

3717
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:04,000
but if they have had,

3718
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:04,841
excuse me,

3719
01:50:04,841 --> 01:50:07,750
if they have had any psychedelic
experience themselves,

3720
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:12,010
they would know what an incredibly
different experience that is.

3721
01:50:12,011 --> 01:50:13,840
Then the normal state of consciousness.

3722
01:50:14,230 --> 01:50:15,910
If you were looking for a culprit,

3723
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:20,980
a thing that would change conscious
beings or intelligent beings like lower

3724
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:21,814
hominids,

3725
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:25,420
something that would just rock
them out of their current state.

3726
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,030
What better thing than,

3727
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:28,150
than psychedelic trucks?

3728
01:50:28,151 --> 01:50:30,640
What other culprits that
you could connect to?

3729
01:50:30,641 --> 01:50:32,500
A doubling of the human brain size?

3730
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:36,310
I've seen it attributed to a bunch of
different things like consumption of fish,

3731
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:36,940
uh,

3732
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:38,350
through the throwing arm,

3733
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,770
all these different things
like don't bears eat fish,

3734
01:50:41,771 --> 01:50:42,750
not these stupid as fuck.

3735
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,530
I guess the Omega threes
would help a little,

3736
01:50:47,531 --> 01:50:48,364
but man,

3737
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:52,980
what's humans are a different thing
that humans are very different thing.

3738
01:50:52,981 --> 01:50:53,270
And,

3739
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:53,921
and uh,

3740
01:50:53,921 --> 01:50:54,310
yeah,

3741
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:55,090
I mean I have,

3742
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:58,090
I have no doubt in my mind it was
psychedelics that played that role.

3743
01:50:58,091 --> 01:50:59,940
And this was one thing
that I looked at in,

3744
01:50:59,941 --> 01:51:00,250
in,

3745
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:01,540
in supernatural was,

3746
01:51:01,541 --> 01:51:04,720
was this whole issue of the
cave art because that's where,

3747
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:05,171
you know,

3748
01:51:05,171 --> 01:51:08,770
that's where in the long evolutionary
story of the human species,

3749
01:51:08,771 --> 01:51:10,900
you suddenly find us
confronting ourselves.

3750
01:51:10,901 --> 01:51:13,050
We're looking at this
amazing symbolic art,

3751
01:51:13,051 --> 01:51:13,960
this incredible,

3752
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,280
incredible works.

3753
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:15,760
Um,

3754
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,760
and these very mysterious Erie spaces
that you go into like the Cape of Lesko.

3755
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:22,720
Um,

3756
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,171
and,

3757
01:51:23,171 --> 01:51:23,620
uh,

3758
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:25,150
from the nature of the art itself,

3759
01:51:25,151 --> 01:51:26,680
it's clear it was visionary art.

3760
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:27,221
These were,

3761
01:51:27,221 --> 01:51:30,040
these were people who were working with
psychedelics and painting their visions

3762
01:51:30,041 --> 01:51:31,840
just as Sherman's doing the Amazon today.

3763
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:34,150
Did you see Werner Herzog's documentary?

3764
01:51:34,151 --> 01:51:37,250
I did cave of a shy dreams about Chavon.

3765
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:38,143
Yeah.

3766
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:41,020
I mean it wasn't that like
40,000 plus years ago.

3767
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:46,021
The stuff 33 or 33,000 years
ago gave a show bay amazing,

3768
01:51:46,331 --> 01:51:47,164
amazing place.

3769
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:47,690
Yeah.

3770
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:50,590
Just so strange to think that these Pete,

3771
01:51:50,591 --> 01:51:52,240
but it's so hard for us to,

3772
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:53,680
when you get to a number,

3773
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:54,970
even a thousand years,

3774
01:51:54,971 --> 01:51:56,560
it's like I can't see it.

3775
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:57,011
I can't,

3776
01:51:57,011 --> 01:51:57,880
it's too far away.

3777
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:00,220
It's almost like it's over
the curve of the earth.

3778
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:04,870
It's like a thousand years to wrap my
head around what it was like during the

3779
01:52:05,030 --> 01:52:06,010
[inaudible] era,

3780
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:06,380
you know,

3781
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:08,030
nevermind 33,000.

3782
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:08,560
Yeah.

3783
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,870
That's where it gets
like incredibly squirly.

3784
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:13,870
And when you talk to guys
like John Anthony West,

3785
01:52:13,871 --> 01:52:18,400
it started talking about the hieroglyphs
that depict a civil is ancient and not

3786
01:52:18,401 --> 01:52:18,881
just that,

3787
01:52:18,881 --> 01:52:22,540
but named the Pharaohs of
30 plus thousand years ago.

3788
01:52:22,541 --> 01:52:23,374
It's loosely,

3789
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,220
there's a,

3790
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:26,440
I mean this is something that
really annoys me about Egypt.

3791
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:29,290
[inaudible] John Anthony West
is just such a brilliant man.

3792
01:52:29,291 --> 01:52:29,950
He's an old,

3793
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:32,320
old friend of mine going
wait way back to the 90s.

3794
01:52:32,330 --> 01:52:32,651
Super,

3795
01:52:32,651 --> 01:52:34,390
Super Guy and he's done so much to,

3796
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:36,910
to bring to light the mysteries and the,

3797
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:37,900
and the magic of,

3798
01:52:37,930 --> 01:52:38,770
of ancient Egypt.

3799
01:52:38,771 --> 01:52:41,080
And he's absolutely right because
you go to the temple of Seti,

3800
01:52:41,081 --> 01:52:44,470
the first and the avatars
and you will see a mural,

3801
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,280
a cop in high relief

3802
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:46,451
on,

3803
01:52:46,451 --> 01:52:48,290
on a wall in the Cardo was shows,

3804
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:49,140
uh,

3805
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:49,941
the pharaoh Seti,

3806
01:52:49,941 --> 01:52:52,640
the first showing his young
son Ramesses the second,

3807
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:55,220
the list of all the pharaohs
who've ruled before their time.

3808
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,230
Now this is called a king list.

3809
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:58,700
And the Egyptologists,

3810
01:52:58,701 --> 01:53:03,701
they take these king lists and they use
them as the basis for the chronology

3811
01:53:03,861 --> 01:53:05,390
that we are given of ancient Egypt.

3812
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:08,420
As long as it fits into
their reference frame.

3813
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:09,590
So the king list is,

3814
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:10,611
is fine.

3815
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:12,980
It's accepted back to 3000 BC.

3816
01:53:12,981 --> 01:53:15,620
The first dentisty when civilization
is supposed to have begun,

3817
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:19,790
they then completely ignore the fact
that the king list continues long before

3818
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:21,680
that for tens of thousands of years,

3819
01:53:21,681 --> 01:53:26,210
as much as 36,000 years before that lists
of pharaohs and the time when the gods

3820
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:26,870
walked the earth.

3821
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:28,790
All of this is in the king lists as well.

3822
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:29,600
So the fee,

3823
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:29,871
you know,

3824
01:53:29,871 --> 01:53:33,650
the Egyptologist grab the bit that fits
their prejudice and ignore the rest and

3825
01:53:33,651 --> 01:53:33,831
say,

3826
01:53:33,831 --> 01:53:34,100
I will.

3827
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,590
The ancient Egyptians
were just making that up.

3828
01:53:36,950 --> 01:53:37,251
Yeah.

3829
01:53:37,251 --> 01:53:41,690
And then there's of course the water
erosion on the Sphinx that John Anthony

3830
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,410
West and Robert Schoch exposure actually.

3831
01:53:43,411 --> 01:53:44,600
So really,

3832
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:46,070
in my opinion,

3833
01:53:46,071 --> 01:53:49,650
one of the most undeniable things
that I've heard people deny.

3834
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:50,030
Yeah.

3835
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:50,361
It's one,

3836
01:53:50,361 --> 01:53:55,361
it's one of the most of it is one of the
most important pieces of evidence for a

3837
01:53:55,641 --> 01:53:56,780
lost civilization.

3838
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:57,031
It,

3839
01:53:57,031 --> 01:53:57,221
and,

3840
01:53:57,221 --> 01:53:57,531
and,

3841
01:53:57,531 --> 01:54:00,830
and this is John Anthony
West and professor Robert
Schoch at Boston University.

3842
01:54:00,831 --> 01:54:01,201
The,

3843
01:54:01,201 --> 01:54:01,730
the,

3844
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:06,110
the evidence that the Great Sphinx was
rained upon for thousands and thousands

3845
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:06,440
of years.

3846
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:06,830
Now,

3847
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:07,340
what's,

3848
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,420
what's interesting,

3849
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,430
and again got Beckley,

3850
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,000
he comes into this story,

3851
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:14,210
is that Egypt ologists at the time said,

3852
01:54:14,211 --> 01:54:14,540
look,

3853
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:17,630
there's no way that the Sphinx
could be 12,000 years old.

3854
01:54:17,631 --> 01:54:22,070
The geological evidence must be wrong
because if there was a culture that was

3855
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:25,610
capable of creating a monument on the
scale of the Sphinx 12,000 years ago,

3856
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:26,001
well,

3857
01:54:26,001 --> 01:54:26,210
why?

3858
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:29,060
We would find other monuments
that are 12,000 years old,

3859
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:29,990
other big monuments.

3860
01:54:29,991 --> 01:54:33,950
And they regarded that as the killer
argument against the geological weathering

3861
01:54:33,951 --> 01:54:34,371
of this thing.

3862
01:54:34,371 --> 01:54:35,001
So that you know,

3863
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:37,010
that shock and West must just be wrong.

3864
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:37,311
Well,

3865
01:54:37,311 --> 01:54:41,630
now we have good Beckley Tempe and it is
12,000 years old and it is on the scale

3866
01:54:41,631 --> 01:54:42,150
of this things.

3867
01:54:42,150 --> 01:54:44,030
And it's not even that
far from this things,

3868
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:44,751
you know,

3869
01:54:44,751 --> 01:54:45,760
and suddenly the,

3870
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:45,981
the,

3871
01:54:45,981 --> 01:54:47,900
that old argument about the Sphinx,

3872
01:54:47,901 --> 01:54:51,230
which was dismissed by
academia back in the 90s,

3873
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:52,820
they're going to have
to reconsider it very,

3874
01:54:52,821 --> 01:54:53,031
very,

3875
01:54:53,031 --> 01:54:53,720
very carefully.

3876
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:57,200
That Charlton Heston hosted
documentary on the Sphinx,

3877
01:54:57,201 --> 01:54:58,034
which was,

3878
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,330
I believe it was on NBC.

3879
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:00,193
It was on NBC.

3880
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:00,950
I watched it.

3881
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:05,000
I found an incredibly fascinating
but in infuriating when you hear that

3882
01:55:05,001 --> 01:55:08,480
Egyptologist just laughing
at Robert Schoch saying,

3883
01:55:08,481 --> 01:55:10,010
where's the evidence of this culture?

3884
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:11,120
Show me the pot shit.

3885
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:11,480
Yeah.

3886
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:12,680
And what's crazy is,

3887
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:17,480
what do you think would be there when
you're dealing with something that's that

3888
01:55:17,481 --> 01:55:17,810
old?

3889
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:18,290
Yeah,

3890
01:55:18,290 --> 01:55:19,310
and when,

3891
01:55:19,311 --> 01:55:20,001
as I said,

3892
01:55:20,001 --> 01:55:22,130
about a thousand years
being over the horizon,

3893
01:55:22,131 --> 01:55:22,964
I can't see it.

3894
01:55:23,150 --> 01:55:24,380
12,000 years,

3895
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:27,170
you might as well just be
speaking another language.

3896
01:55:27,171 --> 01:55:28,004
They don't understand.

3897
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:32,120
My stupid brain can't wrap my
head around how long ago that is.

3898
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:32,481
Terribly.

3899
01:55:32,481 --> 01:55:32,811
Terribly.

3900
01:55:32,811 --> 01:55:33,091
A little bit.

3901
01:55:33,091 --> 01:55:37,400
What would be left if you left
a car outside for 12,000 years,

3902
01:55:37,401 --> 01:55:40,040
you came back 12,000 years
later thing you'd find zero.

3903
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:40,700
Nothing.

3904
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:41,580
Absolutely nothing.

3905
01:55:41,581 --> 01:55:42,950
The earth would just reabsorb it.

3906
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:43,520
Yeah.

3907
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:46,410
What would be laughing and what
would be left would be the stones.

3908
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:46,890
Yeah,

3909
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:47,790
and that's what we're,

3910
01:55:47,791 --> 01:55:48,810
that's what we're left with.

3911
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:51,450
I was just in tea when Arco in Bolivia,

3912
01:55:51,451 --> 01:55:52,284
and there are,

3913
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:53,790
there are stone structures.

3914
01:55:53,791 --> 01:55:55,440
They're beautifully cut,

3915
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:58,230
unbelievable precision
cutting of the stone.

3916
01:55:58,530 --> 01:56:01,140
They looked to me like they had
metal parts fitted into them.

3917
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,760
At some point the metals gone,

3918
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:06,900
the stone is left and where we're left
to wonder what was going on there.

3919
01:56:06,901 --> 01:56:07,560
So yeah,

3920
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:11,190
the passage of time rubs out
all memory and all traces and,

3921
01:56:11,191 --> 01:56:11,580
and,

3922
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:12,000
and,

3923
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,360
and it's very easy to get the
wrong idea about the past.

3924
01:56:15,361 --> 01:56:19,110
But places like Rebecca TAPI pieces like
good on padding in Indonesia are going

3925
01:56:19,111 --> 01:56:19,944
to change this.

3926
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:20,550
What,

3927
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:22,980
what year did people start using metal?

3928
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,833
Um,

3929
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:25,081
you know,

3930
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:26,400
the ancient Egyptians,

3931
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:26,941
you,

3932
01:56:26,941 --> 01:56:27,240
they,

3933
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:27,560
they,

3934
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:29,120
they didn't make that,

3935
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:29,661
but they,

3936
01:56:29,661 --> 01:56:31,110
they knew meteoritic ion.

3937
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:34,530
The only form of iron that was available
to the ancient Egyptians was iron that

3938
01:56:34,531 --> 01:56:35,700
came in and meatier rights.

3939
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:39,420
And there is the odd knife that's
been crafted from meteoritic iron,

3940
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:41,430
but the metal that they used,

3941
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:43,800
if you go back to 3000 or 2000,

3942
01:56:43,801 --> 01:56:45,360
800 BC was copper.

3943
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:46,140
Um,

3944
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:48,240
but they had a way of
hardening the copper,

3945
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:49,021
uh,

3946
01:56:49,021 --> 01:56:49,411
some,

3947
01:56:49,411 --> 01:56:51,870
some loss technique of
making the copper harder.

3948
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:52,380
That was,

3949
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:54,390
that was definitely definitely present.

3950
01:56:54,430 --> 01:56:56,850
How do we know this is the
Orthodox view that I wrote because,

3951
01:56:56,851 --> 01:56:59,900
because the couple was used to
cut stone and copy your card.

3952
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:03,930
Cut Stone with copper is way too soft
so they must have been some method of

3953
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:05,190
making the copper harder.

3954
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:05,581
This is,

3955
01:57:05,581 --> 01:57:06,361
this is the argument,

3956
01:57:06,361 --> 01:57:07,860
but that this is the orthodox view.

3957
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:08,790
Um,

3958
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:09,930
we don't really know.

3959
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:10,291
You know,

3960
01:57:10,291 --> 01:57:10,680
what,

3961
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:13,470
what they had and maybe metal
wasn't the only way to cut stone.

3962
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:15,780
This is where I'd maybe
get a little bit mystical,

3963
01:57:15,781 --> 01:57:16,860
but maybe you know,

3964
01:57:16,861 --> 01:57:20,760
because our society has done things
a certain way that we use mechanical

3965
01:57:20,761 --> 01:57:24,660
advantage that we use machine tools that
we want to look for that in the past.

3966
01:57:24,661 --> 01:57:25,380
But maybe,

3967
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:29,160
maybe there are all sorts of untapped
faculties of the human mind that the

3968
01:57:29,161 --> 01:57:30,670
ancients were working with in,

3969
01:57:30,671 --> 01:57:31,410
in one way or another.

3970
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:36,410
Certainly when you go to a place like
one man in Peru outside of Cusco and you

3971
01:57:36,811 --> 01:57:39,210
see these gigantic
blocks of stone hundred,

3972
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:39,841
hundred and 50 tons,

3973
01:57:39,841 --> 01:57:42,090
each fit it together like jigsaw puzzle,

3974
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:44,340
the edges kind of
melting into one another.

3975
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:48,360
The notion that some sort of heat
might've been used to shape these stones

3976
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:49,920
begins to make a weird kind of sense,

3977
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:51,660
some sort of heat heat here.

3978
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:53,070
That's fascinating.

3979
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,810
And there's vitrified stone up there.

3980
01:57:54,811 --> 01:57:55,360
I've in,

3981
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,580
in my journey in Peru,

3982
01:57:56,581 --> 01:57:57,090
I spent,

3983
01:57:57,090 --> 01:58:00,030
I spent several days with a local
guy called hey Swisscom morrow,

3984
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,160
who is now 77 years old.

3985
01:58:02,161 --> 01:58:02,994
And his father,

3986
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,340
I'm afraid O'mara,

3987
01:58:04,770 --> 01:58:05,250
uh,

3988
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:07,800
was working on that site back at the,

3989
01:58:07,801 --> 01:58:09,300
at the beginning of the 19 hundreds.

3990
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:10,110
And,

3991
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:10,561
and,

3992
01:58:10,561 --> 01:58:11,250
um,

3993
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:15,540
they as a family have been studying
the megaliths of the Andes for,

3994
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,190
for a hundred plus years now.

3995
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:20,340
And they are actually
descended from the anchors.

3996
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:24,540
So you would think if anybody had an
investment in saying that the ink has made

3997
01:58:24,541 --> 01:58:24,841
all this,

3998
01:58:24,841 --> 01:58:25,411
it would be them.

3999
01:58:25,411 --> 01:58:26,161
But they say no,

4000
01:58:26,161 --> 01:58:27,390
he's just Gomorrah is adamant.

4001
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:32,010
The inkers have been wrongly handed
the majority of the architecture in the

4002
01:58:32,011 --> 01:58:33,210
Andes by archaeology.

4003
01:58:33,211 --> 01:58:36,870
The Incas only did a fraction of it and
most of what they did was pretty poor

4004
01:58:36,871 --> 01:58:37,704
quality.

4005
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:41,380
The great stuff was done by earliest
civilizations and he took me and he showed

4006
01:58:41,381 --> 01:58:42,400
me vitrified stone,

4007
01:58:42,401 --> 01:58:44,960
which has been subjected
to fantastic heat and,

4008
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:46,750
and melted and shines in a,

4009
01:58:46,751 --> 01:58:47,840
in a way that's um,

4010
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:50,920
really stunning and striking
and convincing when you see it.

4011
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:51,581
Uh,

4012
01:58:51,581 --> 01:58:55,600
that some kind of technology that is
not the technology that we use today was

4013
01:58:55,601 --> 01:58:57,910
being employed to put
these stones into place.

4014
01:58:57,911 --> 01:59:01,060
And archeologists have dismissed
such ideas for a very long time,

4015
01:59:01,061 --> 01:59:03,280
but I'm not sure how much longer they're
going to be able to dismiss them.

4016
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:08,370
I don't know how they can dismiss those
enormous stones that have strange shapes

4017
01:59:08,801 --> 01:59:11,140
that are fitting like a
gigantic jigsaw puzzle.

4018
01:59:11,141 --> 01:59:11,830
It was like,

4019
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:13,990
it was like giants a hundred feet tall,

4020
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:16,530
decided to make a three
dimensional jigsaw puzzle.

4021
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:18,730
Tell Jimmy what those images
would be to pull those up.

4022
01:59:18,731 --> 01:59:19,400
What would they be?

4023
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:20,230
Um,

4024
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:21,910
I maybe if I show you an image,

4025
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:25,750
have him pull OkayWell Saksaywaman as a c,

4026
01:59:25,751 --> 01:59:26,740
s a y,

4027
01:59:26,741 --> 01:59:27,101
h.

4028
01:59:27,101 --> 01:59:27,281
U.

4029
01:59:27,281 --> 01:59:29,680
A M a n say,

4030
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:31,113
and is also,

4031
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:36,120
there's one stone that Giorgio sucralose
showed me where it was carved out of

4032
01:59:36,251 --> 01:59:38,560
this piece of stone.

4033
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:43,590
There's this slab carved through the back
of it and removed and they don't have

4034
01:59:46,751 --> 01:59:49,390
no idea how they got
through this stone and Co.

4035
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:49,630
Yeah,

4036
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:50,530
they look at that image.

4037
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,430
Oh my God.

4038
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:53,510
That's me.

4039
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:54,910
Which we'll pull it towards you.

4040
01:59:54,911 --> 01:59:55,744
This word,

4041
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:56,890
this way.

4042
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:57,101
No,

4043
01:59:57,101 --> 01:59:57,251
no,

4044
01:59:57,251 --> 01:59:57,371
no,

4045
01:59:57,371 --> 01:59:57,491
no,

4046
01:59:57,491 --> 01:59:57,671
no,

4047
01:59:57,671 --> 01:59:57,821
no,

4048
01:59:57,821 --> 01:59:58,060
no.

4049
01:59:58,060 --> 01:59:58,691
Just flatten.

4050
01:59:58,691 --> 01:59:59,110
Yeah,

4051
01:59:59,110 --> 01:59:59,943
there you go.

4052
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:00,820
That's insane.

4053
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:03,210
That's you standing next
to me standing next,

4054
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:06,670
standing next to that stone and look at
the way those studs are fitted together.

4055
02:00:06,671 --> 02:00:07,031
You know,

4056
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:07,271
I mean,

4057
02:00:07,271 --> 02:00:07,630
that is,

4058
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:09,310
there's a really monstrous thing to do.

4059
02:00:09,311 --> 02:00:09,721
It's a jet,

4060
02:00:09,721 --> 02:00:13,650
just a gigantic work of art
that they've created and,

4061
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:15,340
and it goes on for hundreds of feet.

4062
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:16,320
This is not just this,

4063
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:17,590
there's not just that section.

4064
02:00:17,591 --> 02:00:19,270
It goes on forever in these,

4065
02:00:19,271 --> 02:00:23,410
these huge walls and it does feel like
a three dimensional jigsaw puzzle.

4066
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:24,990
And so beautiful too.

4067
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:26,440
It means that the way they did it,

4068
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:27,340
it's not,

4069
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:30,430
they didn't make everything
square and know and level.

4070
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:30,790
No,

4071
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:35,790
they just decided to use this sort of
method of turning these stones into these

4072
02:00:36,581 --> 02:00:37,810
puzzle pieces and you go,

4073
02:00:37,811 --> 02:00:40,810
when you go look at it up close and you
realize that you can't get a sheet of

4074
02:00:40,811 --> 02:00:42,550
paper in the gaps between the joints,

4075
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:46,870
you realize that you are looking at some
sort of technology that we don't get.

4076
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:48,160
There's something they were there.

4077
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:51,940
There was some way that these people were
able to do this and make it incredibly

4078
02:00:51,941 --> 02:00:54,610
difficult for themselves if
it was done in any modern way.

4079
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:57,760
What's the mainstream
explanation for that?

4080
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:59,620
Oh,

4081
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:03,970
hours and hours of patient Labor by tens
of thousands of people grinding away at

4082
02:01:03,971 --> 02:01:05,200
the stones and making them all fit.

4083
02:01:05,201 --> 02:01:06,190
Consider the planning,

4084
02:01:06,191 --> 02:01:06,431
you know,

4085
02:01:06,431 --> 02:01:07,480
to make that happen.

4086
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:09,010
Let me show the whole wall.

4087
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:09,381
I've got the,

4088
02:01:09,381 --> 02:01:10,660
I've got a picture of the whole wall.

4089
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:12,670
We could pull it up if you
just tell us what patient,

4090
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:13,560
there's the whole world.

4091
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:14,920
Oh my God.

4092
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:17,260
When I say the whole wall,

4093
02:01:17,470 --> 02:01:19,480
I mean that's just a
section of the whole wall.

4094
02:01:19,481 --> 02:01:22,330
That wall runs for hundreds
of feet in all directions.

4095
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:23,440
Um,

4096
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:27,250
the planning that's involved in making
no single block of stone is the same size

4097
02:01:27,251 --> 02:01:27,790
as another.

4098
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:29,050
They're all different sizes.

4099
02:01:29,051 --> 02:01:31,340
They're all tongue and grooved
into each other in this,

4100
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:34,510
in this incredible way and it
really feels like they were melted.

4101
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:36,150
They were kind of softened.

4102
02:01:36,151 --> 02:01:37,600
That's what his whiskey O'mara says.

4103
02:01:37,601 --> 02:01:41,840
He says these stores were softened by
some technique that we don't understand.

4104
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:42,980
He thinks he'd was involved,

4105
02:01:42,981 --> 02:01:46,010
they were softened and in a soft state
they were fitted together and then they

4106
02:01:46,011 --> 02:01:46,844
solidified.

4107
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:50,930
Is that possible that they figured
out some way to make a blow torch or

4108
02:01:50,931 --> 02:01:51,441
something,

4109
02:01:51,441 --> 02:01:52,310
but I think it's possible.

4110
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:52,971
But even then,

4111
02:01:52,971 --> 02:01:54,560
how do you push them into place?

4112
02:01:54,590 --> 02:01:55,940
Not a blow torch necessarily,

4113
02:01:55,941 --> 02:01:59,820
but so this is something goes on the
defies explanation there and what's there

4114
02:01:59,821 --> 02:02:02,060
and I don't think we need
aliens to explain it.

4115
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:03,320
I think it's human work.

4116
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,910
I think it's human workmanship,

4117
02:02:04,911 --> 02:02:08,090
but it's at a level and at a standard
that we do not fully understand.

4118
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:08,780
Yeah.

4119
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:09,141
The,

4120
02:02:09,141 --> 02:02:09,590
um,

4121
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:09,981
that,

4122
02:02:09,981 --> 02:02:12,470
that alien thing gets real weird,

4123
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:13,100
you know?

4124
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:13,221
Well,

4125
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:13,490
it's like,

4126
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:13,790
you know,

4127
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:14,623
I have been,

4128
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:19,660
I've had the privilege of traveling
around this planet for the last 25 years,

4129
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:22,580
looking at ancient sites.

4130
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:23,413
Look at that.

4131
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:26,380
Amazing that sex.

4132
02:02:26,381 --> 02:02:27,214
Say Walmart.

4133
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:29,060
How big are the largest stones?

4134
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:29,630
Uh,

4135
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:31,040
we're about 20 feet high.

4136
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:33,650
150 to 200 tons in weight.

4137
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:34,610
Uh,

4138
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:36,020
six to eight feet thick.

4139
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:36,681
Uh,

4140
02:02:36,681 --> 02:02:37,100
just,

4141
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,180
just monstrous.

4142
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:41,060
200 tons is 400,000 pounds?

4143
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:41,991
Is that what it is?

4144
02:02:41,991 --> 02:02:43,040
200 tons.

4145
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:45,350
I think of it in kilos.

4146
02:02:45,351 --> 02:02:46,610
A ton is a ton.

4147
02:02:46,611 --> 02:02:47,840
Is a thousand kilograms.

4148
02:02:47,841 --> 02:02:48,350
So,

4149
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:48,441
oh,

4150
02:02:48,441 --> 02:02:50,420
you're kilo man killing man.

4151
02:02:50,421 --> 02:02:50,961
I don't,

4152
02:02:50,961 --> 02:02:52,460
I don't do it in pounds anymore.

4153
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:52,930
Police.

4154
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:54,140
You don't do it in stone.

4155
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:56,840
Now we go to England,

4156
02:02:57,410 --> 02:03:00,210
UFC Wayans we have to say like 10 stone.

4157
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:01,791
Everything.

4158
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:03,920
There were 14 pounds in a stone.

4159
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:04,701
Okay,

4160
02:03:04,701 --> 02:03:07,240
so 10 stone made your 140 pounds.

4161
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:08,720
Yeah,

4162
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:09,291
it's weird.

4163
02:03:09,291 --> 02:03:10,460
It's really complicated.

4164
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:11,121
Yeah.

4165
02:03:11,121 --> 02:03:12,050
They're sexy woman.

4166
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:14,660
Now the point looking up at the
top left of the screen there,

4167
02:03:14,661 --> 02:03:18,550
there's some inferior work on top of
the better work and what [inaudible] is

4168
02:03:18,551 --> 02:03:20,720
saying and the inferior work
was the work of the anchors,

4169
02:03:20,721 --> 02:03:21,980
but the other stuff is much older.

4170
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:24,610
So the smaller rocks that
were easily manipulated,

4171
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:29,210
now they were copying the oldest style
and respecting it and overbuilding and

4172
02:03:29,211 --> 02:03:30,110
building around it,

4173
02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:30,380
but,

4174
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:34,040
but they were honoring an earlier and
earlier work of construction and the

4175
02:03:34,041 --> 02:03:37,010
conventional dating of
this is very recent.

4176
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:37,700
The anchors,

4177
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:40,220
the anchors were wiped out by the Spanish.

4178
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:40,970
Uh,

4179
02:03:40,970 --> 02:03:41,990
15,

4180
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:42,680
30,

4181
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:43,161
15,

4182
02:03:43,161 --> 02:03:43,790
40.

4183
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:45,110
They were destroyed as an empire.

4184
02:03:45,111 --> 02:03:45,381
They don't,

4185
02:03:45,381 --> 02:03:48,500
he existed according to history
for 150 years before that,

4186
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:52,280
200 years before that at the
outside and all of this work,

4187
02:03:52,281 --> 02:03:55,310
this incredible megalithic work
that's all over the Andes mountains.

4188
02:03:55,311 --> 02:03:55,631
You can't,

4189
02:03:55,631 --> 02:03:57,050
you can't move for bumping into it.

4190
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:00,530
All of it is supposed to have been built
in that 200 year period by the Incas

4191
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:04,580
because archaeology can't just can't bear
the idea that there might've been some

4192
02:04:04,581 --> 02:04:05,414
earlier culture.

4193
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:06,500
Why date it then?

4194
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:09,090
It seems like if it's so
confusing and so there,

4195
02:04:09,091 --> 02:04:14,091
there's so many open ended questions
where when you see these enormous pieces,

4196
02:04:14,841 --> 02:04:16,100
when we see them fitted together,

4197
02:04:16,101 --> 02:04:17,780
when you don't have an
explanation for how they did it,

4198
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:20,960
you're not exactly sure who did it
because the history gets really murky when

4199
02:04:20,961 --> 02:04:21,760
you get that far back.

4200
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:22,960
You know why date it?

4201
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:24,230
I agree why data,

4202
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:24,621
I don't,

4203
02:04:24,621 --> 02:04:26,330
I don't understand why
they have to do that.

4204
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:26,790
Well,

4205
02:04:26,790 --> 02:04:30,560
it seems to me that archeology comes
to history with a preexisting reference

4206
02:04:30,561 --> 02:04:32,960
frame and makes everything fit into it,

4207
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:36,530
makes everything fit into it and that's
been the mistake of science down the

4208
02:04:36,531 --> 02:04:36,990
ages.

4209
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:40,890
There was a long period that very good
example of this is is that the notion

4210
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:45,450
that the notion that the sun revolved
around the earth that was based on a

4211
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:47,340
preexisting reference
seemed to make sense.

4212
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:48,391
Get up in the morning,

4213
02:04:48,391 --> 02:04:49,620
look at the sonic rises,

4214
02:04:49,621 --> 02:04:50,520
goes through the sky,

4215
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:52,350
but it was complete nonsense.

4216
02:04:52,351 --> 02:04:53,730
It's the earth that's
going around the sun.

4217
02:04:53,731 --> 02:04:57,960
You have to change the reference frame
in order to see what's really going on.

4218
02:04:57,961 --> 02:05:00,120
And I think that's the problem
with history and archeology.

4219
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:00,991
What impact,

4220
02:05:00,991 --> 02:05:01,441
if any,

4221
02:05:01,441 --> 02:05:02,310
has this go back?

4222
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:03,480
Lee TAPI discovered,

4223
02:05:03,870 --> 02:05:04,261
go back,

4224
02:05:04,261 --> 02:05:04,771
Lee Tempe,

4225
02:05:04,771 --> 02:05:08,460
discovery changed archeologists view of,

4226
02:05:08,490 --> 02:05:08,840
of,

4227
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:09,081
of,

4228
02:05:09,081 --> 02:05:10,740
of back dating things.

4229
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:11,461
As I mentioned,

4230
02:05:11,461 --> 02:05:13,170
I liked clash Schmidt when I met him,

4231
02:05:13,171 --> 02:05:14,890
the archeologist who is
working on Quebec City,

4232
02:05:14,891 --> 02:05:15,724
Tempe.

4233
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:16,410
Um,

4234
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:17,101
I thought he was,

4235
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:20,160
I thought he was charming and
enthusiastic and I enjoyed his energy.

4236
02:05:20,190 --> 02:05:22,710
But when I asked him about when I said,

4237
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:23,903
um,

4238
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:27,390
so what does it feel like to be
the man who discovered the site?

4239
02:05:27,391 --> 02:05:29,400
There's rewriting history and he said,

4240
02:05:29,401 --> 02:05:29,820
no,

4241
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:31,320
it's not rewriting history.

4242
02:05:31,321 --> 02:05:34,110
It's adding a new chapter
to existing history.

4243
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:37,800
He still wants to fit it into that
reference frame somehow that we have to,

4244
02:05:37,801 --> 02:05:38,011
okay,

4245
02:05:38,011 --> 02:05:40,770
we have to completely rethink our
ideas about the upper paleolithic,

4246
02:05:40,771 --> 02:05:44,220
but somehow desperately we must look at
this site in a way that's not going to

4247
02:05:44,221 --> 02:05:45,480
rock the boat too much.

4248
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:46,500
And I was sad to hear that.

4249
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:47,160
I think,

4250
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:48,120
I think especially when,

4251
02:05:48,270 --> 02:05:52,050
when he himself admits that at least 20
times as much if not 50 times as much,

4252
02:05:52,051 --> 02:05:54,480
it's still under the ground
or waiting to be excavated.

4253
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:55,560
Um,

4254
02:05:55,560 --> 02:06:00,560
I think a little bit of
provisional thinking is needed
before you just attribute

4255
02:06:00,601 --> 02:06:02,250
that to him being a professional academic.

4256
02:06:02,251 --> 02:06:02,610
Yes.

4257
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:04,920
I think the professional
professional academia,

4258
02:06:04,921 --> 02:06:09,921
particularly in the realm of archeology
encourages those who are working in the

4259
02:06:09,991 --> 02:06:13,830
field to think in terms
of the existing paradigm,

4260
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:17,310
not to think in terms of challenging
the paradigm because it's dangerous.

4261
02:06:17,311 --> 02:06:18,720
If you challenge the paradigm,

4262
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:19,321
uh,

4263
02:06:19,321 --> 02:06:19,651
you,

4264
02:06:19,651 --> 02:06:22,070
you're going to be ridiculed
by your colleagues and,

4265
02:06:22,071 --> 02:06:24,350
and regarded as completely lunatic and,

4266
02:06:24,351 --> 02:06:24,530
and,

4267
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:25,860
and attacked and insulted.

4268
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:26,701
Uh,

4269
02:06:26,701 --> 02:06:28,560
so it's better not to
challenge that paradigm,

4270
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:33,180
but what a fascinating area of
research to not challenge the paradigm,

4271
02:06:33,181 --> 02:06:37,440
an area where you have so little
information about what could have possibly

4272
02:06:37,441 --> 02:06:40,410
happened when you get
back to 5,000 years ago,

4273
02:06:40,411 --> 02:06:41,490
6,000 years ago,

4274
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:42,540
7,000 years ago,

4275
02:06:42,541 --> 02:06:45,990
and you're trying to piece these puzzles
again to pretend that you have the

4276
02:06:45,991 --> 02:06:47,310
entire timeline.

4277
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:48,780
It seems a little silly.

4278
02:06:48,781 --> 02:06:49,614
It's pretty crazy.

4279
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:50,550
It seems so,

4280
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:50,731
I mean,

4281
02:06:50,731 --> 02:06:54,150
it's one thing if you're trying to pretend
that you have a timeline when you're

4282
02:06:54,151 --> 02:06:55,140
dealing with something,

4283
02:06:55,290 --> 02:06:55,981
or excuse me,

4284
02:06:55,981 --> 02:06:57,390
to pretend you have all the information.

4285
02:06:57,391 --> 02:07:00,360
When you're dealing with something like
mathematics or when you're dealing with

4286
02:07:00,361 --> 02:07:02,520
something like very clear,

4287
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:03,540
uh,

4288
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:04,560
manuscripts,

4289
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:05,280
you know like,

4290
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:05,461
oh,

4291
02:07:05,461 --> 02:07:06,294
we have a,

4292
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:06,870
you know,

4293
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:08,760
the Dead Sea scrolls very clearly,

4294
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:10,050
x amount of years old.

4295
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:13,800
This is the thing with history where
you have written documents that you can

4296
02:07:13,801 --> 02:07:16,470
draw upon where you have
those written documents.

4297
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:18,720
You can be reasonably certain
about what's going on.

4298
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,370
The further back we go,

4299
02:07:20,430 --> 02:07:22,830
we don't have the written
documents beyond 5,000 years.

4300
02:07:22,831 --> 02:07:26,820
We have no written documents and to draw
a fixed and firm conclusions about what

4301
02:07:26,821 --> 02:07:30,330
happened before 5,000 years ago on the
basis of a few things dug out of the

4302
02:07:30,331 --> 02:07:31,164
ground.

4303
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:32,040
It's not good enough.

4304
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:32,360
It's,

4305
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:32,561
it's,

4306
02:07:32,561 --> 02:07:32,950
it's,

4307
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:35,590
it's a mistake that's being made
and that I believe is going to,

4308
02:07:35,591 --> 02:07:35,980
is going

4309
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,401
to change.

4310
02:07:36,401 --> 02:07:37,211
It's got to be painful.

4311
02:07:37,211 --> 02:07:38,044
It's going to be slow.

4312
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:41,320
It was painful to change the Ptolemaic
system to the COPERNICAN system,

4313
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:42,520
but it will happen.

4314
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,110
The system will change.

4315
02:07:44,410 --> 02:07:45,040
And the,

4316
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:45,251
the,

4317
02:07:45,251 --> 02:07:47,200
the backdating of the Sphinx,

4318
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:52,300
has there been any progress on that now
because of go back Lee tamping because

4319
02:07:52,330 --> 02:07:52,911
the what,

4320
02:07:52,911 --> 02:07:56,800
what Robert Schoch did
in exposing the erosion,

4321
02:07:56,801 --> 02:07:57,760
the water erosion,

4322
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:59,380
and we briefly touched on this before,

4323
02:07:59,381 --> 02:08:02,860
but I've seen people
dispute it and boy itself,

4324
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:05,530
it seems so forced and labored there.

4325
02:08:05,531 --> 02:08:07,690
They're disputing the,

4326
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:09,880
I have no doubt that
rubber shock is right.

4327
02:08:09,881 --> 02:08:11,710
Robert Robert Shotgun
and John Anthony West,

4328
02:08:11,711 --> 02:08:13,150
they're right about the sphinx.

4329
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:16,180
And they have been attacked
in all kinds of ways,

4330
02:08:16,181 --> 02:08:17,350
in all kinds of elaborate,

4331
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:21,130
contorted explanations have been given
to explain away that kind of weathering.

4332
02:08:21,131 --> 02:08:23,110
But the fact is they remained to be right.

4333
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:25,830
And now we have the tappy.

4334
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:27,130
Now on the other side of the world,

4335
02:08:27,131 --> 02:08:28,210
we have Gunung Padang,

4336
02:08:28,211 --> 02:08:32,490
we have sites that are 12,000
plus years old indisputably.

4337
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:36,790
So I think it sooner or later will
cause a reconsideration of the Sphinx.

4338
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:37,600
I hope so.

4339
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:38,570
And that's something that I,

4340
02:08:38,571 --> 02:08:40,360
I also intend to focus on.

4341
02:08:40,690 --> 02:08:40,841
Well,

4342
02:08:40,841 --> 02:08:41,621
I think it has to.

4343
02:08:41,621 --> 02:08:43,690
And as soon as John Jamie
gets back from the bathroom,

4344
02:08:43,691 --> 02:08:45,400
we'll show some of the images of the,

4345
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:45,701
the,

4346
02:08:45,701 --> 02:08:49,240
the Sphinx in closure
then led Robert Schoch,

4347
02:08:49,241 --> 02:08:54,241
who is a geologist to very
clearly proclaimed that
what you're dealing with is

4348
02:08:54,881 --> 02:08:58,320
thousands of years of water erodes
just as if he has a wheelchair.

4349
02:08:58,600 --> 02:08:59,980
The smoothness of it,

4350
02:08:59,981 --> 02:09:00,940
the curves,

4351
02:09:00,941 --> 02:09:04,750
the fact that there's all these fissures
that indicate water running down.

4352
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:05,320
Yeah.

4353
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,790
And then the area,

4354
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:10,390
I honestly think shock Rabbids Shulkin
John West are going to be seen in future

4355
02:09:10,391 --> 02:09:14,850
generations as the Copernicus of their
time that they saw what nobody else saw.

4356
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:15,240
And,

4357
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,720
and they had the courage to put,

4358
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:18,400
to put the information out there and,

4359
02:09:18,430 --> 02:09:19,780
and they were attacked for it.

4360
02:09:19,781 --> 02:09:20,614
And you know,

4361
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:23,380
people don't get bent at
the stake these days for,

4362
02:09:23,410 --> 02:09:25,390
for proposing alternative ideas.

4363
02:09:25,391 --> 02:09:26,500
But in a kind of way,

4364
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:26,831
you know,

4365
02:09:26,831 --> 02:09:27,400
we do,

4366
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:27,971
there's the,

4367
02:09:27,971 --> 02:09:28,171
the,

4368
02:09:28,171 --> 02:09:28,381
the,

4369
02:09:28,381 --> 02:09:32,200
the vicious nature of the attacks on
people who propose an alternative view of

4370
02:09:32,201 --> 02:09:32,591
history.

4371
02:09:32,591 --> 02:09:33,900
But I think in,

4372
02:09:33,901 --> 02:09:34,840
in our lifetimes,

4373
02:09:34,841 --> 02:09:35,770
we will see this change.

4374
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,120
And if folks haven't seen,

4375
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:37,600
um,

4376
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:42,460
or haven't heard me talk about John
Anthony West amazing documentary series on

4377
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:42,941
Egypt,

4378
02:09:42,941 --> 02:09:46,360
it's called magical Egypt and
I can't recommend it enough.

4379
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:48,880
It is absolutely fascinating.

4380
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:50,440
So in depth,

4381
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:51,071
I believe,

4382
02:09:51,071 --> 02:09:52,840
is it six or seven DVDs?

4383
02:09:52,841 --> 02:09:53,381
I don't know how many,

4384
02:09:53,381 --> 02:09:54,011
like that big,

4385
02:09:54,011 --> 02:09:55,210
big collection of DVDs.

4386
02:09:55,230 --> 02:09:56,470
It's a massive,

4387
02:09:56,471 --> 02:09:57,790
massive amount of work.

4388
02:09:57,820 --> 02:10:01,750
And John is a man who's devoted
his whole life to understanding an,

4389
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:01,930
uh,

4390
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:06,100
an alternative understanding of Egypt
done with great wisdom and great care.

4391
02:10:06,910 --> 02:10:07,241
Yeah,

4392
02:10:07,241 --> 02:10:08,470
it's a really,

4393
02:10:08,471 --> 02:10:11,200
really incredible series
that I've watched many,

4394
02:10:11,201 --> 02:10:15,420
many times over and over again and
try to absorb as much of it as I,

4395
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:16,031
as I can.

4396
02:10:16,031 --> 02:10:17,050
But it's,

4397
02:10:17,051 --> 02:10:18,130
it's so staggering.

4398
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:23,250
And he also showed very clear that there's
some different styles of techniques

4399
02:10:23,741 --> 02:10:24,100
of,

4400
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:28,900
of building and that these older
techniques that you find or different

4401
02:10:28,901 --> 02:10:32,020
techniques or all on a
lower level of the soil,

4402
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:32,861
it's exactly,

4403
02:10:32,861 --> 02:10:34,370
it's exactly like

4404
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:36,230
it is in the Peruvian Andes and,

4405
02:10:36,231 --> 02:10:36,501
and,

4406
02:10:36,501 --> 02:10:36,891
and,

4407
02:10:36,891 --> 02:10:37,190
uh,

4408
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:37,880
Bolivia.

4409
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:38,390
Um,

4410
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:39,260
that what,

4411
02:10:39,261 --> 02:10:43,760
what has happened I think
is that archeology has
taken the work of the latest

4412
02:10:43,761 --> 02:10:47,180
culture to work on the site and
handed the whole site over to,

4413
02:10:47,181 --> 02:10:49,400
it actually gives us a
very complicated site.

4414
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:52,400
You have the Subterranean Chamber
beneath the great pyramid.

4415
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:56,390
Why do we have to believe that that is
from the same date as the pyramid itself?

4416
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:56,871
Uh,

4417
02:10:56,871 --> 02:10:57,780
you have the,

4418
02:10:57,781 --> 02:10:59,990
the so called mortuary
temples and valley temples,

4419
02:10:59,991 --> 02:11:01,670
these gigantic megalithic structures.

4420
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:06,890
The Valley Temple beside the Sphinx is
actually made of blocks of limestone that

4421
02:11:06,891 --> 02:11:10,010
were cut out from around the Sphinx
to create the body of the Sphinx.

4422
02:11:10,011 --> 02:11:11,840
So if the Sphinx is 12,000 years old,

4423
02:11:11,841 --> 02:11:12,860
and I honestly think it is,

4424
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:15,680
then the valley temples are
12,000 years old as well.

4425
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:16,530
Um,

4426
02:11:16,530 --> 02:11:16,790
the,

4427
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:17,170
the,

4428
02:11:17,170 --> 02:11:20,720
what we have are very complex multilayered
sites where there's a very ancient

4429
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:24,260
megalithic layer of architecture and
the later culture comes along perhaps

4430
02:11:24,261 --> 02:11:27,200
venerates that perhaps
overbuilds around it,

4431
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,193
um,

4432
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:30,380
and attempts to copy it in some ways.

4433
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:35,060
And the mistake has been both in the
Andes and in Egypt that the later culture

4434
02:11:35,061 --> 02:11:36,590
has been attributed with all the work.

4435
02:11:36,591 --> 02:11:38,390
We need a more sophisticated,

4436
02:11:38,391 --> 02:11:41,360
the more in depth exploration of this
and I think correctly Tempe is going to

4437
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:42,200
force us to do that.

4438
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:42,651
If Jamie,

4439
02:11:42,651 --> 02:11:46,150
if you could pull up some of the
images that Robert Schoch uh,

4440
02:11:46,190 --> 02:11:49,910
created of the water
errosion as opposed to,

4441
02:11:49,911 --> 02:11:50,260
I mean,

4442
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:51,740
you showed it a little animated,

4443
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:52,260
uh,

4444
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:55,040
or illustrated image of it before,

4445
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:59,570
but it's pretty fascinating stuff and
that seems to me to be the ones smoking

4446
02:11:59,571 --> 02:12:00,440
gun in Egypt,

4447
02:12:00,441 --> 02:12:01,290
that sort of points.

4448
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:02,990
It's a smoking gun for sure.

4449
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:03,980
It's a smoking gun,

4450
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:08,900
which the mainstream academia
has tried to ignore the smoke,

4451
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:10,760
but if the smoke is there and,

4452
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:11,623
and um,

4453
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,280
go back to Tappi going padding,

4454
02:12:13,281 --> 02:12:15,380
other sites are going to
force them to reconsider that.

4455
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:18,440
What are they going to do if they dig
up something that's 30,000 years old?

4456
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:19,640
I mean,

4457
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:20,150
well,

4458
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:23,900
I hope that they're not going
to hide it and pretend it works.

4459
02:12:23,940 --> 02:12:24,201
Well,

4460
02:12:24,201 --> 02:12:25,550
I know of cases where it's happened.

4461
02:12:25,551 --> 02:12:27,950
I know it happened in Malta
when what happened in Malta,

4462
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:28,970
in the hyper igm,

4463
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,680
which is an underground structure
in mortar of amazing undergrads,

4464
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:33,570
one of the one plate,

4465
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:35,300
this should be on everybody's bucket list.

4466
02:12:35,301 --> 02:12:35,691
By the way,

4467
02:12:35,691 --> 02:12:38,630
the hyper GM in multimedia
is an incredible place.

4468
02:12:38,631 --> 02:12:39,270
It's like,

4469
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:42,320
it's like a huge temple
complex cutout underground.

4470
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:43,221
Uh,

4471
02:12:43,221 --> 02:12:43,521
and,

4472
02:12:43,521 --> 02:12:44,410
and um,

4473
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:47,540
there are traces of red
ochre paint on the walls.

4474
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:49,730
They look much more like the caves,

4475
02:12:49,731 --> 02:12:52,610
the painted caves than they look
like stuff from the Neolithic.

4476
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:54,620
And there was at one time,

4477
02:12:54,830 --> 02:12:55,090
uh,

4478
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:57,200
a figure of a hybrid creature,

4479
02:12:57,201 --> 02:12:58,360
a half bison,

4480
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:59,240
half bull.

4481
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:00,140
Um,

4482
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:05,140
such a figure would be normal in the
painted caves from 30,000 years ago,

4483
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:10,100
but doesn't fit in with the idea that
the hyper g and belongs to 5,000 years

4484
02:13:10,101 --> 02:13:10,820
ago.

4485
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:11,341
And,

4486
02:13:11,341 --> 02:13:11,521
uh,

4487
02:13:11,521 --> 02:13:14,930
this was solved by a certain
gentleman who shall remain nameless,

4488
02:13:14,931 --> 02:13:19,931
who had the bison bull scrubbed off
the walls of the hyper geome in Malta.

4489
02:13:21,110 --> 02:13:22,760
It was literally scrubbed off.

4490
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:25,670
I reported this at some length in my book.

4491
02:13:25,671 --> 02:13:26,460
Underworld.

4492
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:26,750
Well,

4493
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:27,220
who do,

4494
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:28,340
who do they think scrubbed it?

4495
02:13:28,490 --> 02:13:28,641
Well,

4496
02:13:28,641 --> 02:13:29,570
we know who scrubbed it.

4497
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:30,440
Um,

4498
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:32,280
it was the former director of museums

4499
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:33,150
and in Malta.

4500
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:33,920
Yeah,

4501
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:35,460
back in back in the 60s.

4502
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,760
He scrubbed it off the
walls and when I took the,

4503
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:39,610
I took the,

4504
02:13:39,611 --> 02:13:41,850
the national museums
of multitask over this,

4505
02:13:41,851 --> 02:13:44,430
when I was back there making a
documentary with channel four,

4506
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:48,900
we put in a formal document to them
asking them to answer this charge and they

4507
02:13:48,901 --> 02:13:49,980
refuse to answer it.

4508
02:13:49,981 --> 02:13:51,630
They would not comment upon it at all.

4509
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:53,610
Wow.

4510
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:54,211
So yeah,

4511
02:13:54,211 --> 02:13:57,450
I mean archeologists do actually sometimes
do incredibly dishonest things to

4512
02:13:57,451 --> 02:13:58,620
maintain the view of history.

4513
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,360
That's so sad.

4514
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:01,260
I mean,

4515
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:05,520
it just think about the whole cycle of
thinking that goes from being a young

4516
02:14:05,521 --> 02:14:07,740
person wanting to explore history,

4517
02:14:07,741 --> 02:14:09,210
wanting to become an archeologist,

4518
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:10,290
getting involved in archeology,

4519
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:15,180
getting involved in academia and then
destroying evidence that's contrary to

4520
02:14:15,181 --> 02:14:17,340
what you've been taught or are teaching.

4521
02:14:17,570 --> 02:14:18,860
It's the opposite of science,

4522
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:20,193
pure science.

4523
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:25,940
It's so scary that human nature and even
in a scientific work sometimes finds

4524
02:14:27,241 --> 02:14:29,710
its way to rear its ugly head that the,

4525
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:34,260
the nasty aspects of human nature can
even find their way into archeology.

4526
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,071
Most unfortunate,

4527
02:14:35,071 --> 02:14:35,520
yeah.

4528
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,810
That they can't in certain
sciences because it's so
cut and dry mathematics and

4529
02:14:39,811 --> 02:14:40,890
physics and you know,

4530
02:14:41,070 --> 02:14:41,600
but in,

4531
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:42,301
in archeology,

4532
02:14:42,301 --> 02:14:46,740
so much is based on interpretation and
the interpretation of very limited facts

4533
02:14:46,741 --> 02:14:47,574
actually.

4534
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:49,020
So what's next for you?

4535
02:14:49,021 --> 02:14:50,040
What do you do from here?

4536
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:51,030
Well,

4537
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:52,770
I am writing at,

4538
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:57,240
at the moment I'm researching and writing
a sequel to fingerprints of the gods,

4539
02:14:57,270 --> 02:14:58,020
fingerprints as that goes,

4540
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:59,730
it was published in 1995.

4541
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:00,570
Um,

4542
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:03,420
the reason I'm doing a sequel
is because of the new evidence.

4543
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:05,580
We've talked about Gunung
Padang in Indonesia,

4544
02:15:05,581 --> 02:15:07,260
we've talked about back Lee tappy,

4545
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:08,790
we've talked about the comment.

4546
02:15:08,791 --> 02:15:13,080
The comment for me is the cataclysmic
smoking gun that explains how we lost a

4547
02:15:13,081 --> 02:15:16,050
whole civilization and a whole
lot of material like this.

4548
02:15:16,051 --> 02:15:18,300
I'm not going to write an update
to fingerprints of the gods.

4549
02:15:18,301 --> 02:15:20,970
I'm going to write a completely
new book and that book,

4550
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,440
I'm in the process of researching.

4551
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:24,330
That's why I'm on these
travels at the moment.

4552
02:15:24,331 --> 02:15:26,460
That's where I'm going to Indonesia
at the beginning of December.

4553
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:27,151
Uh,

4554
02:15:27,151 --> 02:15:29,250
that book will be published at the end,

4555
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:29,821
uh,

4556
02:15:29,821 --> 02:15:34,821
in the fall of 2015 I'm due to deliver
it to the publishers in December,

4557
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:38,880
2014 and it'll be published
in the fall of 2015.

4558
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:39,271
And,

4559
02:15:39,271 --> 02:15:40,380
and this,

4560
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:41,760
I see this as,

4561
02:15:41,761 --> 02:15:42,594
um,

4562
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:43,441
in a way,

4563
02:15:43,441 --> 02:15:47,490
a kind of summation of my life's
work on this whole issue of a lost

4564
02:15:47,491 --> 02:15:48,324
civilization.

4565
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:50,190
And I feel very committed to doing it.

4566
02:15:50,191 --> 02:15:50,791
But honestly,

4567
02:15:50,791 --> 02:15:52,770
my heart these days is in writing novels.

4568
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:53,401
Really.

4569
02:15:53,401 --> 02:15:54,420
I love writing novels.

4570
02:15:54,421 --> 02:15:54,840
Yeah.

4571
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:57,990
So it took a long time for
you to break away from,

4572
02:15:58,090 --> 02:16:01,720
you were originally a journalist then
went from journalism to writing about the

4573
02:16:01,730 --> 02:16:04,710
ancient history and an alternative
view of ancient history,

4574
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:05,821
but it was a,

4575
02:16:05,821 --> 02:16:08,470
it was a psychedelic experience
that led you to want to write.

4576
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:13,350
It was a psychedelic experience with
Iowasca back in 2007 that set me on the

4577
02:16:13,351 --> 02:16:14,820
track to write my first novel,

4578
02:16:14,821 --> 02:16:15,301
which is,

4579
02:16:15,301 --> 02:16:16,230
which is entangled,

4580
02:16:16,231 --> 02:16:16,621
which is,

4581
02:16:16,621 --> 02:16:16,820
uh,

4582
02:16:16,820 --> 02:16:19,020
which is a story of two young women,

4583
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:23,880
one living 24,000 years ago in the Stone
Age one living in modern Los Angeles,

4584
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:24,210
who,

4585
02:16:24,210 --> 02:16:25,910
whose destinies are entangled.

4586
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:27,450
The time is not what it seems,

4587
02:16:27,451 --> 02:16:29,190
that it's a kind of spiral,

4588
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:30,040
a cat's cradle

4589
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,200
of into crossing lines
rather than an arrow.

4590
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:37,600
And they are brought together by a benign
supernatural force who I call the blue

4591
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:41,410
angel to do battle with a
demon who travels through time.

4592
02:16:41,530 --> 02:16:43,840
And then since then I've written war God,

4593
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:44,800
which is a,

4594
02:16:44,801 --> 02:16:47,590
which is a novel about the
Spanish conquest of Mexico,

4595
02:16:48,010 --> 02:16:48,640
um,

4596
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:52,110
did get a British publisher for that
book that book's being published in,

4597
02:16:52,140 --> 02:16:52,361
in,

4598
02:16:52,361 --> 02:16:52,841
in Britain.

4599
02:16:52,841 --> 02:16:53,501
And it did okay.

4600
02:16:53,501 --> 02:16:56,800
It did well enough at any rate for the
publishers in Britain to commission

4601
02:16:56,801 --> 02:16:58,600
volumes two and three because it's a,

4602
02:16:58,840 --> 02:16:59,770
because it's a series,

4603
02:16:59,771 --> 02:17:02,410
I couldn't get any American
publisher to take that book on.

4604
02:17:02,710 --> 02:17:03,191
But,

4605
02:17:03,191 --> 02:17:03,340
uh,

4606
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:07,840
because publishing sees people in
terms of brands and I am branded as a

4607
02:17:07,841 --> 02:17:11,710
nonfiction author and how dare
I write fiction as I dare you.

4608
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:12,910
How dare I do that.

4609
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:13,840
Um,

4610
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:14,380
you know,

4611
02:17:14,380 --> 02:17:15,040
life is short.

4612
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:15,550
I wanted,

4613
02:17:15,550 --> 02:17:16,960
I want to try many,

4614
02:17:16,961 --> 02:17:18,180
many things and uh,

4615
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:22,570
so what I've done is a published it a
pretty much effectively self published it

4616
02:17:22,571 --> 02:17:27,571
in America through Amazon and the
book is available on amazon.com.

4617
02:17:28,390 --> 02:17:29,680
That's what it looks like by the way,

4618
02:17:30,010 --> 02:17:32,970
the u s edition people
can also order uniforms.

4619
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:38,410
People can also order it from bookshops
but it's easier to get it from

4620
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:39,490
amazon.com.

4621
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:40,091
What is that?

4622
02:17:40,091 --> 02:17:40,960
The undercover?

4623
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:43,960
Well that's actually
derived from an Aztec image,

4624
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:44,530
um,

4625
02:17:44,530 --> 02:17:44,851
of a,

4626
02:17:44,851 --> 02:17:45,181
of a,

4627
02:17:45,181 --> 02:17:46,014
of a skull,

4628
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:46,630
um,

4629
02:17:46,630 --> 02:17:47,231
found on a,

4630
02:17:47,231 --> 02:17:49,230
a ball court cause they played this,

4631
02:17:49,231 --> 02:17:53,530
this terrible game of ball game
where the loser had his head cut off.

4632
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:54,610
Um,

4633
02:17:54,610 --> 02:17:55,090
and,

4634
02:17:55,090 --> 02:17:56,670
and a war God is,

4635
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:58,870
is the story of the
Spanish conquest of Mexico.

4636
02:17:58,871 --> 02:17:59,081
And I,

4637

4658
02:18:48,970 --> 02:18:53,860
God dedication's there were guard
dedications@gmail.com that's a beautiful

4659
02:18:53,861 --> 02:18:54,161
image.

4660
02:18:54,161 --> 02:18:56,080
That image of the Aztec skull.

4661
02:18:56,290 --> 02:18:58,810
He had read something
somewhere where scholars were,

4662
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:02,880
they were contemplating whether or
not they were incorrect about the,

4663
02:19:02,881 --> 02:19:03,880
the sacrifice.

4664
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:05,110
And they were saying that there,

4665
02:19:05,111 --> 02:19:09,370
there may be a possibility that they
played a game where they sacrificed the

4666
02:19:09,371 --> 02:19:10,204
winning team.

4667
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:11,973
Uh,

4668
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:15,040
human sacrifice was conducted
on an industrial scale.

4669
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:16,150
If it has take empire.

4670
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:16,431
I,

4671
02:19:16,431 --> 02:19:17,860
I've investigated this very,

4672
02:19:17,861 --> 02:19:18,491
very thoroughly.

4673
02:19:18,491 --> 02:19:19,540
This novel is a novel.

4674
02:19:19,541 --> 02:19:20,111
It's a work of,

4675
02:19:20,111 --> 02:19:21,400
it's a work of fiction,

4676
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:24,520
but I've thoroughly grounded
it in the historical facts.

4677
02:19:24,521 --> 02:19:25,060
And it ended,

4678
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:26,830
this was a tough history to investigate.

4679
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:27,621
Uh,

4680
02:19:27,621 --> 02:19:28,250
I mean the,

4681
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:30,920
the Aztecs were truly
a terrifying culture.

4682
02:19:31,310 --> 02:19:31,910
Uh,

4683
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:36,910
the Spanish who turned up with 490 men
in 11 ships on the Gulf of Mexico in 15,

4684
02:19:37,221 --> 02:19:40,550
19 where if anything and
even more terrifying culture,

4685
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:41,241
uh,

4686
02:19:41,241 --> 02:19:41,540
these,

4687
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:44,780
these are two martial cultures
who are brought together in this,

4688
02:19:44,781 --> 02:19:46,250
in this horrendous conflict.

4689
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:47,030
Um,

4690
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:47,421
but you've,

4691
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:47,871
you know,

4692
02:19:47,871 --> 02:19:48,270
it's,

4693
02:19:48,270 --> 02:19:49,280
it was a different time.

4694
02:19:49,281 --> 02:19:50,830
It was a different world then in,

4695
02:19:50,870 --> 02:19:51,651
in 15,

4696
02:19:51,651 --> 02:19:52,370
19.

4697
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:52,760
And,

4698
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:53,061
and,

4699
02:19:53,061 --> 02:19:53,270
uh,

4700
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:56,720
I've tried to tell the story through
the eyes of ordinary human beings.

4701
02:19:56,721 --> 02:19:59,000
My main heroin is a
true historical figure.

4702
02:19:59,330 --> 02:20:03,890
A woman called Molly [inaudible] who
became the mistress and the interpreter of

4703
02:20:03,891 --> 02:20:04,461
Cortez.

4704
02:20:04,461 --> 02:20:05,840
And when she enters history,

4705
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,670
she's given to Cortez as a,

4706
02:20:08,090 --> 02:20:10,100
as a surrender gift by the Maya.

4707
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:11,420
When she enters history,

4708
02:20:11,421 --> 02:20:14,870
it's already clear that she
has a grudge against Moctezuma,

4709
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:16,220
the Aztec Emperor,

4710
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:20,570
and that she is going to use Cortez
as her instrument to bring him down.

4711
02:20:20,571 --> 02:20:25,190
And I was just interested in her quest
for revenge against the Aztec Empire and

4712
02:20:25,191 --> 02:20:25,731
also to have,

4713
02:20:25,731 --> 02:20:26,180
uh,

4714
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:28,910
a woman who was a hero in a
story rather than just a man.

4715
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:29,480
What is,

4716
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:30,290
what is the,

4717
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:31,460
trying to think through
the first little bit.

4718
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:31,670
Yeah.

4719
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:36,650
What is the origin of this
horrific level of human sacrifice?

4720
02:20:36,651 --> 02:20:37,280
Like what,

4721
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,110
what started it all with the Aztecs?

4722
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:39,620
Like why?

4723
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:39,801
Well,

4724
02:20:39,801 --> 02:20:40,640
that's again,

4725
02:20:40,641 --> 02:20:45,590
that's a reason why I've written war
God as a novel because for the Aztecs,

4726
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:49,550
they believe that they were in touch with
a supernatural entity that they called

4727
02:20:49,551 --> 02:20:49,941
Witsell,

4728
02:20:49,941 --> 02:20:51,530
a poshly hummingbird.

4729
02:20:51,531 --> 02:20:54,470
I use his name in the English
translation in the book Hummingbird,

4730
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:56,210
who is their god of war?

4731
02:20:56,211 --> 02:20:56,721
He's there.

4732
02:20:56,721 --> 02:20:57,760
He's there war guard.

4733
02:20:57,770 --> 02:20:58,160
And,

4734
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:02,720
and this is an area where we have to
recognize that there is a dark side to

4735
02:21:02,721 --> 02:21:03,554
psychedelics.

4736
02:21:04,010 --> 02:21:07,310
I am a big fan of psychedelics and I do
think that psychedelics have a hugely

4737
02:21:07,311 --> 02:21:08,150
important role to play.

4738
02:21:08,151 --> 02:21:12,800
But the Aztecs were using
psilocybin mushrooms in their
human sacrifice rituals.

4739
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:18,130
And Moctezuma was encountering
this demonic entity Hummingbird,

4740
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:19,190
uh,

4741
02:21:19,190 --> 02:21:21,410
in Psilocybin trances and,

4742
02:21:21,411 --> 02:21:24,110
and was constantly being
given incredibly bad,

4743
02:21:24,111 --> 02:21:25,760
even wicked advice by him.

4744
02:21:25,761 --> 02:21:26,570
And there's this,

4745
02:21:26,570 --> 02:21:26,971
so I'm,

4746
02:21:26,971 --> 02:21:31,670
I'm playing with the idea
of dark spiritual forces at
work behind human history,

4747
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:33,770
manipulating Moctezuma,

4748
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:38,960
manipulating Cortez and plunging
mankind into this sea of,

4749
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:41,120
of cruelty in and misery.

4750
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:42,170
Um,

4751
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:42,921
and you know,

4752
02:21:42,921 --> 02:21:45,830
what redeems the story for
me and does it at all times,

4753
02:21:45,831 --> 02:21:48,410
is that the human spirit's
still shines through.

4754
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:49,880
Even in the darkest times.

4755
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:51,020
There is courage,

4756
02:21:51,050 --> 02:21:51,890
there is decency,

4757
02:21:51,891 --> 02:21:53,030
there is love people.

4758
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:56,100
People struggle to show
the best in themselves and,

4759
02:21:56,130 --> 02:21:56,560
and,

4760
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:57,100
and,

4761
02:21:57,100 --> 02:21:58,550
and to deliver the best in themselves.

4762
02:21:58,551 --> 02:22:00,340
So I've tried to show both sides of this.

4763
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:02,510
This book is about the
battle of good against evil.

4764
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:05,720
And it's not that the Spanish are good
and the Aztecs evil because the Spanish

4765
02:22:05,721 --> 02:22:06,291
were wicked,

4766
02:22:06,291 --> 02:22:06,621
wicked,

4767
02:22:06,621 --> 02:22:07,520
wicked as well.

4768
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:08,420
Um,

4769
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:09,500
and they did terrible things.

4770
02:22:09,501 --> 02:22:10,940
They fed people to dogs.

4771
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:11,680
Um,

4772
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:11,880
they,

4773
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:12,251
they,

4774
02:22:12,251 --> 02:22:13,480
they burned people at the state.

4775
02:22:13,481 --> 02:22:15,380
What is actually burning
somebody at the stake,

4776
02:22:15,381 --> 02:22:16,970
if not a form of human sacrifice.

4777
02:22:17,030 --> 02:22:19,010
That's what the Spanish
were due to their God.

4778
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,100
They were sacrificing
people to their gods.

4779
02:22:21,101 --> 02:22:23,660
So no different from the
Aztecs and that respect,

4780
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:25,340
the level of sacrifice.

4781
02:22:25,530 --> 02:22:26,500
So insane that I,

4782
02:22:26,501 --> 02:22:30,210
I tried to explain it to a friend of
mine and he literally told me I was

4783
02:22:30,211 --> 02:22:31,680
bullshitting when I told them,

4784
02:22:31,681 --> 02:22:31,950
uh,

4785
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:34,090
that 80,000 people were sacrificing.

4786
02:22:34,210 --> 02:22:37,470
Thousand were sacrificed
period of like four days,

4787
02:22:37,471 --> 02:22:38,230
four days,

4788
02:22:38,230 --> 02:22:38,460
uh,

4789
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:39,630
with teams of killers,

4790
02:22:39,631 --> 02:22:43,470
50 teams of killers working at the top
of the great pyramid to process people

4791
02:22:43,471 --> 02:22:46,590
within a minute or two per process.

4792
02:22:46,591 --> 02:22:46,850
Them,

4793
02:22:46,850 --> 02:22:47,461
I think of it,

4794
02:22:47,461 --> 02:22:48,151
that's how it's done.

4795
02:22:48,151 --> 02:22:49,950
It was an done on an industrial scale.

4796
02:22:49,951 --> 02:22:53,520
Cues of victims stretching
a mile in every direction,

4797
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:54,240
uh,

4798
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:57,690
marching up the pyramid and having there
and having their hearts cutout and all

4799
02:22:57,691 --> 02:22:59,450
of this in honor of a,

4800
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:00,840
of a demonic,

4801
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:01,321
uh,

4802
02:23:01,321 --> 02:23:02,370
demonic entity,

4803
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:04,770
which the Aztecs passionately believed in.

4804
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:08,100
They believed that he needed to
be fed human hearts and blood.

4805
02:23:08,101 --> 02:23:08,934
And when they call,

4806
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:10,620
they called him Witsell a poshly,

4807
02:23:10,621 --> 02:23:13,020
which means hummingbird at
the left hand of the son.

4808
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:14,460
He's the war God after whom,

4809
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:16,870
this after whom this novel is a is,

4810
02:23:16,871 --> 02:23:17,180
is,

4811
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:18,013
is named.

4812
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:18,601
Uh,

4813
02:23:18,601 --> 02:23:19,351
and he,

4814
02:23:19,351 --> 02:23:19,591
I,

4815
02:23:19,591 --> 02:23:20,071
the way,

4816
02:23:20,071 --> 02:23:21,000
the way I look at it,

4817
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:26,220
the same demonic entity is
manipulating both Moctezuma and Cortez.

4818
02:23:26,221 --> 02:23:29,660
He appears to Cortez in dreams and
takes on the disguise of Saint Peter.

4819
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:31,850
He appears to Moctezuma as the,

4820
02:23:31,860 --> 02:23:32,581
as the war garb,

4821
02:23:32,581 --> 02:23:34,890
but it's the same demon
that's playing with men.

4822
02:23:34,891 --> 02:23:36,570
And that's one reason why
I wrote this as a novel,

4823
02:23:36,571 --> 02:23:38,820
because you can't get into this
stuff in a nonfiction book,

4824
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,811
but it's very real.

4825
02:23:39,811 --> 02:23:43,710
It's a very real part of human history
and the whole shape of the world we live

4826
02:23:43,711 --> 02:23:44,544
in today.

4827
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:45,190
The,

4828
02:23:45,190 --> 02:23:47,730
the terrible genocide that
happened in North America,

4829
02:23:47,731 --> 02:23:49,620
the destruction of North American Indians,

4830
02:23:49,890 --> 02:23:51,600
the conquest of Peru,

4831
02:23:51,810 --> 02:23:54,420
the whole relationship of
the European powers to,

4832
02:23:54,470 --> 02:23:55,830
to Africa for example.

4833
02:23:55,831 --> 02:24:00,110
All of this was based on what
happened in those years between 15,

4834
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:01,050
19 and 15,

4835
02:24:01,051 --> 02:24:04,440
21 when the Spanish conquest
of Mexico and folded.

4836
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:05,150
Um,

4837
02:24:05,150 --> 02:24:05,450
and,

4838
02:24:05,450 --> 02:24:06,230
and uh,

4839
02:24:06,230 --> 02:24:08,430
I think we would let on to a dark track.

4840
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:11,130
Imagine how it could have
been if those two cultures,

4841
02:24:11,131 --> 02:24:14,970
if the Spanish and the Aztecs had
met one another in a spirit of mutual

4842
02:24:14,971 --> 02:24:15,660
learning,

4843
02:24:15,660 --> 02:24:17,250
how much there was to exchange,

4844
02:24:17,251 --> 02:24:20,800
how much each side of the Atlantic could
have learned from the other instead of

4845
02:24:20,801 --> 02:24:21,000
three.

4846
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,300
It becomes this kind of conflagration of,

4847
02:24:24,310 --> 02:24:24,580
uh,

4848
02:24:24,580 --> 02:24:24,990
of,

4849
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:25,823
of blood,

4850
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:31,010
but it's difficult to place ourselves in
the mindset of the people of that time.

4851
02:24:31,300 --> 02:24:33,240
It is difficult for us to do that today.

4852
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:33,880
Um,

4853
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:34,920
and I have to say,

4854
02:24:34,921 --> 02:24:36,420
when you look at the Spaniards,

4855
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:41,310
I mean 490 men turn up on the coast of
Mexico in 11 ships and they are going to

4856
02:24:41,311 --> 02:24:45,960
take on this empire that can put
200,000 men into the field that will,

4857
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:47,100
if they catch you,

4858
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:49,740
will match you up the pyramid
and cut your heart out.

4859
02:24:49,770 --> 02:24:53,070
And many Spaniards were
sacrificed in sight of their,

4860
02:24:53,071 --> 02:24:53,970
of their colleagues.

4861
02:24:54,390 --> 02:24:54,720
Um,

4862
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:56,610
it was an extraordinary time.

4863
02:24:56,611 --> 02:24:59,600
It was an extraordinary event and men
of those times were different from,

4864
02:24:59,710 --> 02:25:00,543
from men of today,

4865
02:25:00,570 --> 02:25:01,403
I believe.

4866
02:25:01,410 --> 02:25:06,410
What is the mainstream
explanation for human sacrifice?

4867
02:25:06,631 --> 02:25:07,110
Like what,

4868
02:25:07,110 --> 02:25:09,090
what do they believe started off?

4869
02:25:09,150 --> 02:25:09,361
Well,

4870
02:25:09,361 --> 02:25:09,751
that it's,

4871
02:25:09,751 --> 02:25:14,751
that it's a feeding of psychic
energy to supernatural beings.

4872
02:25:14,820 --> 02:25:16,650
That's what human sacrifices about that,

4873
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:21,680
that that you take the psychic energy
of the individual you're going to kill

4874
02:25:21,691 --> 02:25:21,930
you,

4875
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:22,763
kill them,

4876
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:27,190
take their psychic energy and feed it
to these vampire like creatures that are

4877
02:25:27,191 --> 02:25:28,720
lying in the beyond that,

4878
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:31,780
that thrive on human misery and pain.

4879
02:25:32,290 --> 02:25:32,891
And you know,

4880
02:25:32,891 --> 02:25:35,320
who are we to say that
such things do not exist?

4881
02:25:35,321 --> 02:25:37,360
We don't understand the nature of reality.

4882
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:39,130
And if you look at human culture day,

4883
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:40,480
I mean look at wars,

4884
02:25:40,481 --> 02:25:42,370
look at wars that are
happening in the world today.

4885
02:25:42,370 --> 02:25:45,400
Look at the tens of thousands of people
that are being slaughtered in warfare

4886
02:25:45,401 --> 02:25:45,940
today.

4887
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:47,890
That's also a kind of human sacrifice.

4888
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:52,240
I think we have to consider
the possibility that some
kind of demonic force is

4889
02:25:52,241 --> 02:25:53,740
thriving on this and,

4890
02:25:53,741 --> 02:25:54,370
and,

4891
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:56,140
and being nourished by it.

4892
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:59,500
And that's one of the things that we
need to do as human beings is to separate

4893
02:25:59,501 --> 02:26:00,550
ourselves from that and say,

4894
02:26:00,551 --> 02:26:01,300
no,

4895
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:02,320
we will not do that.

4896
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:04,150
We will not feed that energy.

4897
02:26:04,390 --> 02:26:08,150
We will not offer lives easier.

4898
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:08,621
The beyond.

4899
02:26:08,621 --> 02:26:10,030
I don't go with you on that,

4900
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:11,410
but I do in a way,

4901
02:26:11,530 --> 02:26:13,810
I don't believe in demons,

4902
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:14,681
but I do.

4903
02:26:14,681 --> 02:26:19,681
I think it's undeniable that there have
been massive groups of people that have

4904
02:26:20,231 --> 02:26:22,480
participated in horrific things.

4905
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:23,830
So what is that,

4906
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:25,510
if not demonic?

4907
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:26,290
I believe it's,

4908
02:26:26,290 --> 02:26:27,160
I believe it's demonic.

4909
02:26:27,161 --> 02:26:28,360
I can't prove it.

4910
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:30,280
I can't prove that that's the case.

4911
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:34,270
I just think we should stay open to that
possibility that the nature of reality

4912
02:26:34,271 --> 02:26:38,800
is so complex and so multilayered that
there may be much more going on than we

4913
02:26:38,801 --> 02:26:39,191
think.

4914
02:26:39,191 --> 02:26:40,060
And that if we just,

4915
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:44,500
if we just confine our explanations of
things to purely economic and material

4916
02:26:44,501 --> 02:26:44,891
terms,

4917
02:26:44,891 --> 02:26:46,540
we may be missing part of the picture.

4918
02:26:46,790 --> 02:26:47,091
Uh,

4919
02:26:47,091 --> 02:26:51,070
and that when the ancient spoke
of angels and demons to use words,

4920
02:26:51,071 --> 02:26:53,740
I'm not saying that I believe
in angels or demons as such,

4921
02:26:53,741 --> 02:26:56,500
but when they spoke of
Lawton light and dark forces,

4922
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:59,590
negative and positive
forces playing on the,

4923
02:26:59,591 --> 02:27:00,341
on the human race,

4924
02:27:00,341 --> 02:27:01,690
maybe they had something going.

4925
02:27:01,691 --> 02:27:02,910
Maybe there was something to that.

4926
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:03,140
Well,

4927
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:06,790
I always consider the fact that human
beings have this incredibly broad spectrum

4928
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:07,840
of possibility.

4929
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:08,870
It's incredibly bar,

4930
02:27:09,010 --> 02:27:11,230
broad spectrum of
behavior and personality,

4931
02:27:11,231 --> 02:27:12,011
of circumstance,

4932
02:27:12,011 --> 02:27:12,844
of genetics,

4933
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,430
and that there's this
Yin and Yang of life.

4934
02:27:15,430 --> 02:27:17,770
There's this pull and push of life,

4935
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:20,830
and that the extreme ends
of it are good and evil,

4936
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:21,380
good and evil.

4937
02:27:21,380 --> 02:27:21,710
Yeah.

4938
02:27:21,710 --> 02:27:21,970
And,

4939
02:27:21,970 --> 02:27:22,540
and it's,

4940
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:23,980
it may not be a demon,

4941
02:27:23,981 --> 02:27:26,020
but it might as well be a
demon if you're marching.

4942
02:27:26,021 --> 02:27:28,780
80,000 people off the side of a pyramid
and cutting their heart out with a

4943
02:27:28,781 --> 02:27:29,950
fucking stone tool.

4944
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:30,700
Yeah.

4945
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:31,450
That's demonic.

4946
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:32,283
It might as well be,

4947
02:27:32,390 --> 02:27:33,370
might as well be a demon.

4948
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:33,761
Yeah.

4949
02:27:33,761 --> 02:27:34,001
And,

4950
02:27:34,001 --> 02:27:34,331
and,

4951
02:27:34,331 --> 02:27:35,290
and that is a,

4952
02:27:35,291 --> 02:27:36,310
that is worth considering.

4953
02:27:36,311 --> 02:27:36,581
And the A,

4954
02:27:36,581 --> 02:27:37,151
and the question is,

4955
02:27:37,151 --> 02:27:37,820
what is,

4956
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:38,100
you know,

4957
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:39,040
what is going on here?

4958
02:27:39,041 --> 02:27:44,041
I have a very dear friend called James
Tiburon who refers to this world that we

4959
02:27:44,201 --> 02:27:49,000
live in as a university of
[inaudible] that we have,

4960
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:49,863
um,

4961
02:27:49,930 --> 02:27:52,240
that we have lessons
to learn from duality,

4962
02:27:52,241 --> 02:27:53,140
maybe dualities,

4963
02:27:53,141 --> 02:27:53,921
not the whole thing.

4964
02:27:53,921 --> 02:27:56,730
Maybe there is an overarching
unity and oneness in,

4965
02:27:56,731 --> 02:27:57,430
in all things.

4966
02:27:57,430 --> 02:28:00,160
But right now here in this
incarnation on planet earth,

4967
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:02,110
we have to learn from duality.

4968
02:28:02,111 --> 02:28:05,260
And the thing about duality
is human beings can choose.

4969
02:28:05,261 --> 02:28:06,340
We can always choose,

4970
02:28:06,341 --> 02:28:09,220
even in the most straightened
and difficult circumstances,

4971
02:28:09,221 --> 02:28:12,130
we can always choose for the
light rather than the darkness.

4972
02:28:12,131 --> 02:28:13,780
We can always choose for
good rather than evil.

4973
02:28:13,781 --> 02:28:17,740
We don't have to take that act that
causes pain and suffering to another human

4974
02:28:17,741 --> 02:28:18,101
being.

4975
02:28:18,101 --> 02:28:19,390
We never have to do that.

4976
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:21,130
We can always choose not to.

4977
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:26,060
The alarming thing is that people often
will choose the act that causes pain and

4978
02:28:26,061 --> 02:28:30,050
suffering to others and we are defined
by our choices and this is where we need

4979
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:32,270
to grow up as a species
and start to choose,

4980
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:33,620
start to choose the light.

4981
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:36,290
Do you think that this broad
spectrum of possibilities,

4982
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:39,080
whether it's possibilities
of thinking or behavior,

4983
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:44,440
it's almost there to educate us as to
the possibilities of this destructive

4984
02:28:44,841 --> 02:28:49,841
possibilities that this huge spectrum
that we have is is it's so open ended and

4985
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:55,160
so massive as to indicate that there
are these extreme variables and these

4986
02:28:55,161 --> 02:28:59,750
extreme variables can push
us by understanding of the
consequences into a more

4987
02:28:59,751 --> 02:29:00,584
positive way.

4988
02:29:00,930 --> 02:29:01,970
They didn't exist.

4989
02:29:02,180 --> 02:29:06,140
If these horrific ideas of war and
of human sacrifice didn't exist,

4990
02:29:06,290 --> 02:29:08,270
maybe we wouldn't appreciate love as much.

4991
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:11,540
We would not appreciate love as much
and we would have nothing to learn from

4992
02:29:11,541 --> 02:29:11,930
this,

4993
02:29:11,930 --> 02:29:16,250
this strange and troublesome
and mysterious and beautiful
thing called being a

4994
02:29:16,251 --> 02:29:17,084
human being.

4995
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:18,650
We have to learn here.

4996
02:29:18,651 --> 02:29:20,810
We learn here because there are those,

4997
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:24,830
those two different poles at the extreme
end of which are good and evil with all

4998
02:29:24,831 --> 02:29:26,570
kinds of gradations in between.

4999
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:30,890
That is what teaches us and then it's
the choices we make day by day as we go

5000
02:29:30,891 --> 02:29:33,590
through life that define us ultimately.

5001
02:29:33,591 --> 02:29:33,980
Now,

5002
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:37,160
whether there is any
transcendental consequence to that,

5003
02:29:37,161 --> 02:29:38,720
something beyond this life,

5004
02:29:38,750 --> 02:29:39,620
something that some,

5005
02:29:39,621 --> 02:29:40,280
some,

5006
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:42,180
some reckoning to take place as,

5007
02:29:42,181 --> 02:29:44,330
as the ancient Egyptians
certainly believe there was.

5008
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:45,670
I don't know for sure but I,

5009
02:29:45,710 --> 02:29:50,710
but I do know that a lifetime of making
decisions that cause pain and suffering

5010
02:29:50,871 --> 02:29:52,470
to others and that inflict and,

5011
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:55,040
and that detract from their sovereignty,

5012
02:29:55,430 --> 02:29:55,821
uh,

5013
02:29:55,821 --> 02:29:56,391
is,

5014
02:29:56,391 --> 02:29:56,651
is,

5015
02:29:56,651 --> 02:29:56,931
is,

5016
02:29:56,931 --> 02:30:00,740
is a life that ultimately the person
who's lived that life is diminished by it.

5017
02:30:01,070 --> 02:30:04,400
I want to know how they got
80,000 people to get an aligned,

5018
02:30:04,401 --> 02:30:06,530
to give their heart to cut out terror.

5019
02:30:07,220 --> 02:30:08,031
Total terror.

5020
02:30:08,031 --> 02:30:10,430
They were the dominant military force in,

5021
02:30:10,490 --> 02:30:13,580
in the Valley of Mexico at
that they were very dominant.

5022
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:14,031
They asked,

5023
02:30:14,031 --> 02:30:15,740
tex had a huge secret police force.

5024
02:30:15,741 --> 02:30:16,880
They spied on one another.

5025
02:30:16,881 --> 02:30:17,840
They spied on their neighbors.

5026
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:22,130
They would carry out human sacrifices
as object lessons to their neighbors.

5027
02:30:22,131 --> 02:30:24,530
You will pay us tribute or
this is what we will do to you.

5028
02:30:24,531 --> 02:30:26,090
They skinned people alive.

5029
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:26,660
They would,

5030
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:27,471
they would truly,

5031
02:30:27,471 --> 02:30:28,700
truly awful.

5032
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,301
Uh,

5033
02:30:29,301 --> 02:30:29,571
and,

5034
02:30:29,571 --> 02:30:31,040
and it was their awfulness.

5035
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:35,930
It was the horrific nature of as tech
behavior that led them to lose that battle

5036
02:30:36,110 --> 02:30:37,310
against Cortez,

5037
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:37,910
uh,

5038
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:38,361
because,

5039
02:30:38,361 --> 02:30:40,430
because quarter had numbers are crazy.

5040
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:40,911
Cortez,

5041
02:30:40,911 --> 02:30:44,360
490 men as TX 200,000 is pretty,

5042
02:30:44,430 --> 02:30:46,040
you think it's pretty
obvious who's going to win?

5043
02:30:46,041 --> 02:30:46,791
How does Cortez,

5044
02:30:46,791 --> 02:30:47,840
when he wins,

5045
02:30:47,841 --> 02:30:50,480
because the Aztecs
neighbors hate the Aztecs.

5046
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:53,600
They have lived in terror
of them for 200 years,

5047
02:30:53,900 --> 02:30:55,580
and they see him as a liberator.

5048
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,840
They see him as somebody who is going to
lift this yoke off their shoulders and,

5049
02:30:59,850 --> 02:31:01,820
and allow them to be free.

5050
02:31:01,821 --> 02:31:02,181
Of course,

5051
02:31:02,181 --> 02:31:03,350
they didn't know that.

5052
02:31:03,351 --> 02:31:04,910
He was just gonna make things worse.

5053
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:05,541
Uh,

5054
02:31:05,541 --> 02:31:05,781
but,

5055
02:31:05,781 --> 02:31:05,901
uh,

5056
02:31:05,901 --> 02:31:06,681
in the time,

5057
02:31:06,681 --> 02:31:07,580
in the nature of things,

5058
02:31:07,581 --> 02:31:08,211
at the time,

5059
02:31:08,211 --> 02:31:09,410
that was how it was felt.

5060
02:31:09,411 --> 02:31:09,621
I mean,

5061
02:31:09,621 --> 02:31:13,400
it's a fact that there were 30
million people in Mexico in 15,

5062
02:31:13,401 --> 02:31:15,320
19 and 50 years later,

5063
02:31:15,321 --> 02:31:16,400
they were just 1 million.

5064
02:31:16,730 --> 02:31:20,130
The Spanish were responsible for
a genocide of 29 million people.

5065
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:21,840
So they didn't make things better,

5066
02:31:21,841 --> 02:31:23,700
but it looked like they'd
make things better.

5067
02:31:23,790 --> 02:31:25,220
And they came as a kind of comma.

5068
02:31:25,221 --> 02:31:25,650
And,

5069
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:26,760
and here's the weird thing again,

5070
02:31:26,761 --> 02:31:29,550
I'll show this cover because
beside it is the feathered serpent,

5071
02:31:30,050 --> 02:31:30,570
um,

5072
02:31:30,570 --> 02:31:31,403
in this,

5073
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:32,573
in this,

5074
02:31:32,630 --> 02:31:33,463
uh,

5075
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:34,343
photograph,

5076
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:35,970
and that's quite solid collateral.

5077
02:31:36,180 --> 02:31:36,471
The,

5078
02:31:36,471 --> 02:31:37,920
the feathered serpent who is,

5079
02:31:37,921 --> 02:31:38,521
who is there.

5080
02:31:38,521 --> 02:31:41,160
And this is another reason why Cortez one,

5081
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:41,760
uh,

5082
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:46,760
because he was able to play
on the prophecy that a god
of peace would return and

5083
02:31:47,311 --> 02:31:47,431
that,

5084
02:31:47,431 --> 02:31:49,890
that God would overthrow wicked king.

5085
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:51,780
And he was the feathered serpent.

5086
02:31:51,781 --> 02:31:55,110
He was quite psychiatry and
it was predicted that he
would return in the Aztec

5087
02:31:55,111 --> 02:31:56,760
year one reed.

5088
02:31:57,090 --> 02:32:01,140
And it so happened that Cortez landed on
the coast of Mexico with his tiny army

5089
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:03,810
in the Aztec year one reed 15,

5090
02:32:03,811 --> 02:32:05,430
19 was the year one reed.

5091
02:32:05,431 --> 02:32:09,810
So the return of [inaudible] was
a key part of Cortez is a victory.

5092
02:32:09,811 --> 02:32:10,644
And my heroin.

5093
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:13,740
Molly Nol is the person who
tells Cortez about this.

5094
02:32:13,741 --> 02:32:14,041
She,

5095
02:32:14,041 --> 02:32:19,041
she's the one who shows him how to
exploit this and how to play Moctezuma's

5096
02:32:19,141 --> 02:32:22,350
superstition and fear to
represent himself as this God,

5097
02:32:22,351 --> 02:32:23,070
but of course,

5098
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:24,450
Cortez is not a god of peace.

5099
02:32:24,450 --> 02:32:25,230
He's a,

5100
02:32:25,230 --> 02:32:26,280
he's a god of war.

5101
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:28,020
It's a quite a quite a coincidence.

5102
02:32:28,180 --> 02:32:28,950
It was amazing.

5103
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:30,000
Amazing coincidence.

5104
02:32:30,001 --> 02:32:31,820
Is that what it is or is it a prophecy?

5105
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:32,191
Again,

5106
02:32:32,191 --> 02:32:33,030
you have to wonder.

5107
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:34,710
You have to wonder how this,

5108
02:32:34,711 --> 02:32:37,620
how this could have happened because
the prophecy was quite specific.

5109
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:42,750
That quits our collateral
and his companions would
return in the year one reed,

5110
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:46,770
they would return in ships that
moved by themselves without paddles.

5111
02:32:46,830 --> 02:32:48,660
What were the Spanish
ships with their sales,

5112
02:32:48,661 --> 02:32:50,730
but ships that move by
themselves without paddles.

5113
02:32:51,090 --> 02:32:56,090
They would be dressed in shining metal
armor and they would deploy weapons

5114
02:32:56,941 --> 02:32:58,080
called she who cattle,

5115
02:32:58,081 --> 02:32:59,550
which means fire serpents,

5116
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,830
which would dismember man at a distance,

5117
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:02,970
I.

5118
02:33:02,970 --> 02:33:02,970
E.

5119
02:33:02,970 --> 02:33:03,030
Guns,

5120
02:33:03,030 --> 02:33:03,960
all of this cannon,

5121
02:33:03,990 --> 02:33:06,540
all of this was right
there in the prophecy.

5122
02:33:06,650 --> 02:33:09,000
And Cortez was able to
step right into that,

5123
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:13,440
into that role and to turn around what
should have been an obvious defeat for

5124
02:33:13,441 --> 02:33:14,610
his tiny force into,

5125
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,260
into a stunning,

5126
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:17,580
stunning victory.

5127
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:19,590
That is absolutely fascinating.

5128
02:33:19,591 --> 02:33:22,140
So many correlating ideas.

5129
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:22,580
Yeah.

5130
02:33:22,580 --> 02:33:22,830
Yeah.

5131
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:24,570
So many correlating ideas come together.

5132
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:28,170
And that's why I felt I want to write a
book about this and that's why I thought

5133
02:33:28,171 --> 02:33:31,860
I wanted to get inside the heads of the
characters and deal with that battle of

5134
02:33:31,861 --> 02:33:33,030
good against evil at a,

5135
02:33:33,031 --> 02:33:33,811
at a level that won't,

5136
02:33:33,811 --> 02:33:35,280
can't do in a nonfiction book.

5137
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:37,620
How old was this prophesy?

5138
02:33:37,650 --> 02:33:37,921
Well,

5139
02:33:37,921 --> 02:33:39,360
that image that I showed of the,

5140
02:33:39,361 --> 02:33:40,590
of the feathered serpent,

5141
02:33:40,830 --> 02:33:41,280
um,

5142
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:41,641
again,

5143
02:33:41,641 --> 02:33:43,800
I show it that image of
the feathered serpent,

5144
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:46,200
which side of my screen and my own here,

5145
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:48,750
that image of the feathered serpent is,

5146
02:33:48,751 --> 02:33:52,170
I'm from La Venta in the Gulf of Mexico.

5147
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:55,260
And that is in the oldest
archeological strata of Mexico.

5148
02:33:55,590 --> 02:34:00,300
That image dates to an archeological
strata that is about 1,500 BC,

5149
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:01,410
uh,

5150
02:34:01,410 --> 02:34:02,520
3000,

5151
02:34:02,521 --> 02:34:04,050
500 years ago.

5152
02:34:04,410 --> 02:34:06,720
The stone itself may be
much older than that,

5153
02:34:06,721 --> 02:34:10,020
but the strategist dug up from
was already 3,500 years old.

5154
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:10,950
So this notion,

5155
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:12,790
and there are many images of,

5156
02:34:12,791 --> 02:34:17,791
of people with kind of Caucasian features
found in the same stratum notion of a

5157
02:34:17,950 --> 02:34:22,180
mysterious strangers who were in Mexico
at some time and who would return is

5158
02:34:22,181 --> 02:34:24,010
very ancient in the Mexican system.

5159
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:24,701
Wow.

5160
02:34:24,701 --> 02:34:25,960
And how did they,

5161
02:34:25,961 --> 02:34:26,651
I mean there's a,

5162
02:34:26,651 --> 02:34:29,740
there's a very different
language that they used then,

5163
02:34:29,741 --> 02:34:30,431
then hours.

5164
02:34:30,431 --> 02:34:34,030
And it was very difficult for
them to decipher a lot of the,

5165
02:34:34,031 --> 02:34:34,390
uh,

5166
02:34:34,390 --> 02:34:37,000
especially the Mayan
there were in the Aztec,

5167
02:34:37,210 --> 02:34:37,961
the way their,

5168
02:34:37,961 --> 02:34:38,310
uh,

5169
02:34:38,310 --> 02:34:38,510
what,

5170
02:34:38,510 --> 02:34:40,090
what exactly they were saying.

5171
02:34:40,210 --> 02:34:42,280
How did they figure out that the,

5172
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:47,290
they're saying ships
without oars and things.

5173
02:34:47,350 --> 02:34:48,690
It's fired guns the whole day.

5174
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:50,170
It's an interesting point that you raise.

5175
02:34:50,171 --> 02:34:52,690
So when Cortez fest lands in Mexico,

5176
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:55,210
he lands in the Yucatan,

5177
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:55,991
uh,

5178
02:34:55,991 --> 02:34:58,360
and the people who live in
the Yucatan are the Maya.

5179
02:34:58,400 --> 02:34:59,300
They're not the Aztecs.

5180
02:34:59,310 --> 02:35:00,970
They are the first people he encounters.

5181
02:35:01,570 --> 02:35:03,790
And there he has an
incredible stroke of luck.

5182
02:35:03,791 --> 02:35:05,380
He can't speak a word of mine.

5183
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:08,320
And nor can anybody else
in his group of Spaniards.

5184
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:13,420
But they discovered that somebody who
looks like them is living on the mainland

5185
02:35:13,421 --> 02:35:14,710
as a prisoner of the Maya.

5186
02:35:14,750 --> 02:35:17,950
They're Spanish first landed in
Cozumel holiday resort today,

5187
02:35:18,310 --> 02:35:19,270
and the the,

5188
02:35:19,271 --> 02:35:21,970
the Mayan tribe on Cozumel
were relatively peaceful,

5189
02:35:21,971 --> 02:35:23,530
but the people on the mainland were not.

5190
02:35:23,531 --> 02:35:24,311
And they,

5191
02:35:24,311 --> 02:35:24,560
the,

5192
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:29,050
the Maya have Cozumel came to Cortez
and they said this with sign language.

5193
02:35:29,051 --> 02:35:32,830
They pointed at him and they said
Castilian they actually told him he was a

5194
02:35:32,831 --> 02:35:34,090
Castilian and caught his thought.

5195
02:35:34,091 --> 02:35:35,590
How can they know I'm a Castilian?

5196
02:35:35,591 --> 02:35:36,910
That's what the Spanish called themselves.

5197
02:35:37,210 --> 02:35:37,490
And,

5198
02:35:37,490 --> 02:35:38,920
and gradually through sign language,

5199
02:35:38,921 --> 02:35:40,330
he figured out what it was,

5200
02:35:40,570 --> 02:35:44,170
that there was a Spaniard who'd been
shipwrecked on the coast of Mexico.

5201
02:35:44,170 --> 02:35:44,921
At some point,

5202
02:35:44,921 --> 02:35:46,600
it turned out it was 11 years before.

5203
02:35:46,601 --> 02:35:46,931
In fact,

5204
02:35:46,931 --> 02:35:51,931
26 Spaniards had been shipwrecked 11
years before 25 of them had been eaten by

5205
02:35:52,541 --> 02:35:53,374
the Maya,

5206
02:35:53,530 --> 02:35:57,100
but one Hiroshima Aguilar had survived.

5207
02:35:57,101 --> 02:36:00,130
So Cortez grabbed him and I
tell this story in my book,

5208
02:36:00,131 --> 02:36:02,050
and Cortez became a Aguilar,

5209
02:36:02,051 --> 02:36:03,730
became Cortez is first interpreter.

5210
02:36:03,731 --> 02:36:04,181
So suddenly,

5211
02:36:04,181 --> 02:36:05,410
because he spoke fluent Maya.

5212
02:36:05,411 --> 02:36:05,740
By then,

5213
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:10,030
he'd been living amongst the Maya for
11 years and he spoke Spanish as well.

5214
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:12,250
So suddenly they could
understand the Maya,

5215
02:36:12,251 --> 02:36:13,870
they could communicate with the Maya,

5216
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:19,090
but then when they went on and they
encountered the Aztecs for the first time,

5217
02:36:19,330 --> 02:36:22,720
the Aztec spoke another language
and that language was not a wattle.

5218
02:36:22,930 --> 02:36:25,840
The language of the Aztecs and ag
will are suddenly became useless.

5219
02:36:25,990 --> 02:36:28,900
He couldn't speak Nahuatl
and that's where my heroine,

5220
02:36:28,901 --> 02:36:30,190
who is a true historical figure,

5221
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:32,600
Malina thrusts herself forward.

5222
02:36:32,620 --> 02:36:35,230
She's already been handed
over to Cortez as a prisoner.

5223
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:36,900
She speaks fluent Navajo,

5224
02:36:36,910 --> 02:36:38,860
Atul and fluent Maya,

5225
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:40,600
and she communicates to Cortez,

5226
02:36:40,601 --> 02:36:40,960
look,

5227
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,160
I can work with your man,

5228
02:36:42,161 --> 02:36:42,994
Aguilar.

5229
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:44,630
I will give you,

5230
02:36:44,670 --> 02:36:46,480
you will put the words from Spanish,

5231
02:36:47,050 --> 02:36:47,980
you'll speak Spanish.

5232
02:36:48,010 --> 02:36:52,020
Aguilar will give me those words in
Maya and I will translate them into now

5233
02:36:52,030 --> 02:36:55,000
Hawaii and the reverse
with the Aztec and pastors.

5234
02:36:55,001 --> 02:36:57,880
And within weeks she
has replaced Anguillara.

5235
02:36:57,910 --> 02:36:58,900
She's a genius.

5236
02:36:59,110 --> 02:37:00,610
She mastered Spanish.

5237
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:05,790
She becomes Cortez sole interpreter and
she's communicating for him with the

5238
02:37:06,071 --> 02:37:06,521
Aztecs.

5239
02:37:06,521 --> 02:37:10,180
And there's an amazing scene where
she encounters Moctezuma directly,

5240
02:37:10,540 --> 02:37:13,660
she and Cortez face to
face with Moctezuma.

5241
02:37:13,661 --> 02:37:16,700
And in those days if you
looked Moctezuma in the eye,

5242
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:17,563
you were killed.

5243
02:37:17,570 --> 02:37:18,440
This is what the Aztecs,

5244
02:37:18,441 --> 02:37:19,490
nobody could look them in the eye.

5245
02:37:19,491 --> 02:37:23,060
They had to fall on their faces and the
local accounts from the time tell us how

5246
02:37:23,061 --> 02:37:27,680
Marinell standing there on the causeway
outside Tenochtitlan looked Moctezuma

5247
02:37:27,681 --> 02:37:28,730
straight in the eye.

5248
02:37:28,790 --> 02:37:32,390
She never lowered her eyes for a second
as she gave him the words of Cortez.

5249
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:35,640
And I'm just fascinated by
the courage of this woman and,

5250
02:37:35,641 --> 02:37:38,740
and what drove her to use Cortez,

5251
02:37:38,780 --> 02:37:40,910
her instrument to bring Moctezuma down.

5252
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,110
And she's a real historic,

5253
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:43,220
real historical figure.

5254
02:37:43,221 --> 02:37:45,290
There's still a statue of
here in Mexico City today.

5255
02:37:45,291 --> 02:37:48,620
She became not only
Cortez is a interpreter,

5256
02:37:48,650 --> 02:37:52,010
but also his mistress and um,

5257
02:37:52,190 --> 02:37:53,870
the mother and the mother of his child.

5258
02:37:53,871 --> 02:37:53,990
Yeah.

5259
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:55,010
And by all accounts,

5260
02:37:55,011 --> 02:37:56,390
she was a very beautiful woman.

5261
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:58,040
I'd would be disappointed
if you didn't banger.

5262
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:06,470
You can't find a single cell bad angle
as tech painting of Cortez that doesn't

5263
02:38:06,471 --> 02:38:07,580
have [inaudible] in it.

5264
02:38:08,090 --> 02:38:10,070
And she was in the heart of every battle.

5265
02:38:10,120 --> 02:38:10,460
Uh,

5266
02:38:10,460 --> 02:38:12,950
and there's another
Spanish writer of the time,

5267
02:38:13,430 --> 02:38:14,060
um,

5268
02:38:14,060 --> 02:38:14,450
uh,

5269
02:38:14,450 --> 02:38:14,691
who,

5270
02:38:14,691 --> 02:38:19,580
who spoke about her as a bee Bernardy
as a common soldier who wrote a memoir

5271
02:38:19,581 --> 02:38:21,470
called the history of the
conquest of new Spain.

5272
02:38:21,890 --> 02:38:22,723
And it's He who,

5273
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:24,560
who tells us that Martinelle's beauty,

5274
02:38:24,561 --> 02:38:25,191
her grace,

5275
02:38:25,191 --> 02:38:25,821
her courage,

5276
02:38:25,821 --> 02:38:26,041
her,

5277
02:38:26,041 --> 02:38:26,370
her,

5278
02:38:26,370 --> 02:38:26,590
her,

5279
02:38:26,590 --> 02:38:27,230
her charm.

5280
02:38:27,230 --> 02:38:29,600
She's regarded as a
traitor in Mexico today.

5281
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:31,190
Cause she,

5282
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:32,210
Cortez said it,

5283
02:38:32,211 --> 02:38:32,511
he said,

5284
02:38:32,511 --> 02:38:33,860
aside from God himself,

5285
02:38:33,890 --> 02:38:36,920
it was Marlina who gave me
this conquest of Mexico.

5286
02:38:37,430 --> 02:38:37,941
Uh,

5287
02:38:37,941 --> 02:38:38,330
and,

5288
02:38:38,330 --> 02:38:39,530
and that's it.

5289
02:38:39,531 --> 02:38:41,690
One woman changed the
history of the world.

5290
02:38:42,070 --> 02:38:42,410
Uh,

5291
02:38:42,410 --> 02:38:43,070
Lamar Lynch.

5292
02:38:43,070 --> 02:38:44,180
That's how the Spanish knew her.

5293
02:38:44,181 --> 02:38:45,410
They knew her as Lama lynching.

5294
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:46,220
Wow,

5295
02:38:46,220 --> 02:38:47,240
that's amazing.

5296
02:38:47,241 --> 02:38:49,010
So she's the central
character in my novel,

5297
02:38:49,011 --> 02:38:52,490
and we'd meet her in the fattening
pen at the foot of the great pyramid,

5298
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:55,370
along with another woman who
plays a big part in my story,

5299
02:38:55,371 --> 02:38:55,701
a young,

5300
02:38:55,701 --> 02:38:56,780
which called Toci.

5301
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:58,070
And this is the motive.

5302
02:38:58,071 --> 02:38:58,904
This is why Marla,

5303
02:38:58,990 --> 02:38:59,751
Marla escapes.

5304
02:38:59,751 --> 02:39:04,400
But this is why she wants to bring
Moctezuma down because she sees him as the

5305
02:39:04,401 --> 02:39:05,810
head of an empire of terror.

5306
02:39:06,230 --> 02:39:10,490
And she sees Cortez as the only way
to bring Moctezuma to his knees.

5307
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:10,701
Well,

5308
02:39:10,701 --> 02:39:11,501
it's fascinated.

5309
02:39:11,501 --> 02:39:13,820
They would regard her as a traitor.

5310
02:39:13,821 --> 02:39:16,820
When you think about what Montezuma
had done to his own people.

5311
02:39:16,821 --> 02:39:17,630
That's,

5312
02:39:17,630 --> 02:39:18,590
that's amazing.

5313
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:18,891
Well,

5314
02:39:18,891 --> 02:39:19,251
again,

5315
02:39:19,251 --> 02:39:19,941
to give balance,

5316
02:39:19,941 --> 02:39:22,970
we have to say that the
Spanish did in horrible,

5317
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:23,961
horrible things.

5318
02:39:23,961 --> 02:39:25,220
Feeding people to dogs,

5319
02:39:25,221 --> 02:39:27,830
using people as target
practice for their weapons.

5320
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:30,280
Let's see if this Spanish Toledo steel,

5321
02:39:30,290 --> 02:39:32,030
we'll cut off this man's arm.

5322
02:39:32,031 --> 02:39:32,301
You know,

5323
02:39:32,301 --> 02:39:32,541
things,

5324
02:39:32,541 --> 02:39:33,051
things like that.

5325
02:39:33,051 --> 02:39:33,560
They just,

5326
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:33,940
they,

5327
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:34,400
they were,

5328
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:35,930
they were true,

5329
02:39:35,931 --> 02:39:36,350
true,

5330
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:36,891
true horrors.

5331
02:39:36,891 --> 02:39:37,370
And,

5332
02:39:37,370 --> 02:39:41,780
and Cortez was a man of war
in every possible way and
an a machiavellian player.

5333
02:39:41,781 --> 02:39:42,614
Very cunning,

5334
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:43,693
very clever.

5335
02:39:43,860 --> 02:39:44,330
Um,

5336
02:39:44,330 --> 02:39:46,700
you can't help admiring
him in certain ways,

5337
02:39:46,701 --> 02:39:47,150
but,

5338
02:39:47,150 --> 02:39:48,800
but he was unbelievably cruel.

5339
02:39:48,980 --> 02:39:52,760
What brought down Cortez Cortez
was brought down by old age.

5340
02:39:52,761 --> 02:39:52,981
He,

5341
02:39:52,981 --> 02:39:53,451
he,

5342
02:39:53,451 --> 02:39:53,690
uh,

5343
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:58,690
wanted to become the king of Mexico
after he eventually apocalyptic final

5344
02:39:59,601 --> 02:40:00,320
battle.

5345
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:02,240
When the Spanish took tell us did land,

5346
02:40:02,241 --> 02:40:06,920
which is the old name for make to Mexico
City and Cortez really it's clear that

5347
02:40:06,921 --> 02:40:09,650
his plan was to become
the new king of Mexico,

5348
02:40:09,950 --> 02:40:13,860
but the king of Spain had different
ideas and they pulled Cortez down.

5349
02:40:13,890 --> 02:40:14,070
They

5350
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,850
gave him,

5351
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:15,870
they gave him a title,

5352
02:40:15,871 --> 02:40:17,310
he became a Marquess.

5353
02:40:17,670 --> 02:40:18,300
But uh,

5354
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:20,640
he was never allowed
to fulfill his dreams.

5355
02:40:20,641 --> 02:40:22,800
And I see Karma at work in that as well.

5356
02:40:23,210 --> 02:40:23,700
Um,

5357
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:24,750
if he'd been a better man,

5358
02:40:24,751 --> 02:40:27,300
perhaps he would have been
allowed to fulfill some dreams,

5359
02:40:27,430 --> 02:40:28,000
whatever.

5360
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,370
The guy lived to be old.

5361
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:34,110
It's amazing for those times and
those times you live to be 60,

5362
02:40:34,111 --> 02:40:34,830
you were old.

5363
02:40:34,830 --> 02:40:35,663
How old did he live?

5364
02:40:35,670 --> 02:40:36,960
He lived to be about 58.

5365
02:40:37,020 --> 02:40:37,860
That's amazing.

5366
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:38,460
Yeah.

5367
02:40:38,460 --> 02:40:39,480
No antibiotics,

5368
02:40:39,481 --> 02:40:40,220
no asprin.

5369
02:40:40,220 --> 02:40:40,550
No.

5370
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:42,810
And they had a massive war.

5371
02:40:42,811 --> 02:40:43,201
Wounds.

5372
02:40:43,201 --> 02:40:43,861
He was,

5373
02:40:43,861 --> 02:40:45,180
he was clubbed on the head.

5374
02:40:45,181 --> 02:40:46,230
His skull was broken.

5375
02:40:46,430 --> 02:40:46,730
They've,

5376
02:40:46,730 --> 02:40:49,890
they've examined the skull of Cortez and
there's three separate times that his

5377
02:40:49,891 --> 02:40:50,760
skull was fractured.

5378
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:53,030
What battles and a,

5379
02:40:53,110 --> 02:40:54,680
in each time he recovered and,

5380
02:40:54,681 --> 02:40:55,500
and bounced back.

5381
02:40:55,500 --> 02:40:56,610
They were men of steel.

5382
02:40:56,611 --> 02:40:57,330
The Spaniards.

5383
02:40:57,330 --> 02:40:57,960
They were,

5384
02:40:57,960 --> 02:40:59,430
they were the ultimate warriors.

5385
02:40:59,430 --> 02:41:01,500
We have a tiny though they were small,

5386
02:41:01,530 --> 02:41:04,830
but they were mean like how
big were they in five feet,

5387
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:05,723
five feet tall?

5388
02:41:06,150 --> 02:41:06,983
They were small guys.

5389
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:09,800
Was that because of a lack of
food and I guess a Trisha I guess.

5390
02:41:09,870 --> 02:41:10,470
I guess so.

5391
02:41:10,470 --> 02:41:10,771
It's a,

5392
02:41:10,771 --> 02:41:11,820
it's a nutritional issue.

5393
02:41:11,821 --> 02:41:12,240
They're all,

5394
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:13,073
you know,

5395
02:41:13,090 --> 02:41:15,630
people are tolerate today in
those times they were small.

5396
02:41:15,690 --> 02:41:17,160
That is absolutely fascinating,

5397
02:41:17,161 --> 02:41:17,461
isn't it?

5398
02:41:17,461 --> 02:41:20,520
How much does stitch the shape
of human beings has changed?

5399
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:21,391
Take Japan,

5400
02:41:21,391 --> 02:41:24,180
the shape of human beings has changed
radically in Japan in the last,

5401
02:41:24,181 --> 02:41:25,170
in the last 50 years,

5402
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:26,560
there's some enormous Japanese,

5403
02:41:26,990 --> 02:41:27,520
Japanese,

5404
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,220
no big giant wrestlers.

5405
02:41:29,640 --> 02:41:30,031
Exactly.

5406
02:41:30,031 --> 02:41:32,880
There's been quite a few that have
entered into mixed martial arts,

5407
02:41:32,890 --> 02:41:33,930
which just enormous,

5408
02:41:33,931 --> 02:41:36,570
enormous men and it's to
do is to do with nutrition.

5409
02:41:36,750 --> 02:41:37,440
Definitely.

5410
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:38,820
Definitely fascinating.

5411
02:41:39,240 --> 02:41:40,350
So can I say that again?

5412
02:41:40,351 --> 02:41:44,790
If anybody is interested in actually
supporting my work and spending a few

5413
02:41:44,790 --> 02:41:46,080
dollars on getting hold of a copy of war,

5414
02:41:46,081 --> 02:41:46,590
God,

5415
02:41:46,590 --> 02:41:47,520
go to my website,

5416
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:48,960
buy it through the Amazon link,

5417
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:50,970
check out the email address that's there,

5418
02:41:50,971 --> 02:41:55,530
which is war God dedications@gmail.com
write to me and I will at my own expense

5419
02:41:55,531 --> 02:42:00,320
by air mail send you assigned dedicated
bookplate to go inside your copy of Walk

5420
02:42:00,321 --> 02:42:00,510
God.

5421
02:42:00,510 --> 02:42:02,940
But that offer is only good
for about the next 10 days.

5422
02:42:02,970 --> 02:42:06,150
I guarantee you just saw the gang of
books cause that was really fascinating.

5423
02:42:06,151 --> 02:42:06,451
I'm,

5424
02:42:06,451 --> 02:42:07,620
I'm going to buy it tonight.

5425
02:42:07,621 --> 02:42:09,630
I'm really blown away by that whole idea.

5426
02:42:09,631 --> 02:42:10,470
The whole story.

5427
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:13,290
The woman who was the
translator as a whole thing.

5428
02:42:13,291 --> 02:42:15,750
It's so fascinating that there's,

5429
02:42:15,780 --> 02:42:17,790
when you live in this sweet,

5430
02:42:17,791 --> 02:42:19,560
cushy society that we live in today,

5431
02:42:19,710 --> 02:42:22,990
especially here in Los Angeles where
it doesn't even rain and you know,

5432
02:42:23,250 --> 02:42:26,550
go to a supermarket and get some meat
is everything's so soft and easy.

5433
02:42:26,610 --> 02:42:30,750
Everything's laid on hard for us to
wrap our heads around that just 500 plus

5434
02:42:30,751 --> 02:42:31,291
years ago,

5435
02:42:31,291 --> 02:42:32,670
this was going down in Mexico.

5436
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:33,090
Yeah.

5437
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:33,923
Amazing.

5438
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:35,273
Graham Hancock.

5439
02:42:35,550 --> 02:42:36,540
Every time you come on,

5440
02:42:36,541 --> 02:42:39,180
it's better than the time
before you blew me away again,

5441
02:42:39,181 --> 02:42:39,451
man.

5442
02:42:39,451 --> 02:42:39,591
You,

5443
02:42:39,591 --> 02:42:39,840
you,

5444
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:40,111
you,

5445
02:42:40,111 --> 02:42:40,351
you,

5446
02:42:40,351 --> 02:42:41,670
you broke whatever you'd,

5447
02:42:41,970 --> 02:42:44,610
whatever record you sat in the
last one as each other today.

5448
02:42:44,970 --> 02:42:45,331
Man,

5449
02:42:45,331 --> 02:42:47,540
I hope a million people go out
and buy your book after that.

5450
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:48,900
That's absolutely fascinating.

5451
02:42:48,990 --> 02:42:49,621
So again,

5452
02:42:49,621 --> 02:42:50,520
it's war God.

5453
02:42:50,521 --> 02:42:51,870
You can get it on Amazon.

5454
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:56,010
And the book that really got me into
Graham Hancock in the first place,

5455
02:42:56,011 --> 02:42:57,360
which has fingerprints of the gods.

5456
02:42:57,570 --> 02:43:01,470
Also available everywhere on
Amazon tangle links for war.

5457
02:43:01,471 --> 02:43:02,460
Got Her on my website,

5458
02:43:02,770 --> 02:43:05,110

5459

Thank you very much man.

5461
02:43:07,220 --> 02:43:08,053
That was amazing.

5462
02:43:08,370 --> 02:43:08,731
Really,

5463
02:43:08,731 --> 02:43:09,990
really fascinating stuff.

5464
02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:11,010
