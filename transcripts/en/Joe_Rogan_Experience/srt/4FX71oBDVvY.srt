1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,280
To get squirrely,
four,

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,140
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,130
one.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,870
Boom.
I gotta ask Donnie Vincent who made that

5
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:10,570
knife because people always ask me about
it.

6
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,030
It's awesome.
I could have used it on Saturday.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,670
When is dfc the side that you guys were 
on where you guys were in the crowd?

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,540
Did anybody jump toward you that way?
No.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,350
The crowd mainly started.
It was because we were.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,213
We had,
I'm pretty sure we had Irish right in 

11
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,114
front of us and right in front of them 
was some of Khabib's guys and Khabib's 

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,863
guys were turning around just literally 
throwing the fingers right to the Irish 

13
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:46,171
guys the whole time.
So then once that happened it was like I

14
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:48,820
was lucky though.
I had A.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,520
I had,
I had already and Whitney right there.

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,590
They were.
They were there to protect you?

17
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:54,020
Yeah,
they,

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,370
they were in full,
thrown down.

19
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,963
I was just,
I was one of the dumb people just kind 

20
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,590
of looking around like the mushrooms 
that everybody has there.

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,210
Any immediate danger?
No,

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,590
it A.
I mean,

23
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:08,710
obviously it seemed way worse over on 
your side,

24
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,173
but I was more worried when they made us
leave because the further up you got in 

25
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:15,844
the bleachers and once you got out into 
the concession area and in the 

26
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:20,410
bathrooms,
that's where stuff was going down.

27
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:22,960
Like just people from the crowd.
Um,

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,853
you know,
guys with Irish flags all obviously 

29
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:26,734
we're getting trashed talk to them and 
there was a big brawl right next to me 

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,590
on the other side from where they were 
sitting.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,690
Right.
There was one just to our right.

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,613
I was looking at,
I believe it was the guy that jumped in 

33
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:37,924
and the registered on convenience team 
when they were trying to leave and 

34
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:41,740
they're getting them out,
people in the crowd or like,

35
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:44,500
ah,
they start throwing shit at them first.

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,373
Like that's how the,
that's where the first shit was getting 

37
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:49,300
thrown down and some other people know 
that it was them.

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,040
We,
we all saw it.

39
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,570
She saw them as like,
that's the guy,

40
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,920
that's the guy right there right now.
It's like,

41
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:54,880
ah,
I don't know.

42
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,170
And he went and tried to do something 
and I was doing but,

43
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:58,960
but

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,793
you know,
there's a price to be paid for all this 

45
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,080
shit,
like all the,

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,170
all the drama and the trash talk and 
that makes it so fun.

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,750
It also,
you know,

48
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:10,400
it has the potential for blown up in 
your face ultimately.

49
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,234
Like couple people got punched.
But it was in an event where a bunch of 

50
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,910
people got punched.
You know what I mean?

51
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:18,770
It's like way more than that.
It was awesome.

52
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,880
Yeah.
But you know what I'm saying,

53
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:21,950
it's like we,
we made it seem.

54
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,813
It seemed like it was way worse than it 
really was because in any other 

55
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,930
situation it would be way worse than it 
really was.

56
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,590
Like if it was a rock concert and some 
dudes just from,

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,453
you know,
like one band was the opening band and 

58
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:40,400
then there was another band that was in 
a bra with them and they were,

59
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,403
they were the main event and then the 
fans of one band through down with the 

60
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,180
fans of the other band of beat the shit 
out of each other.

61
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,310
That would,
for whatever reason,

62
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,780
be way worse than when it's at a fight 
because if it's at a fight,

63
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:54,920
it's just fighters.
Oh,

64
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,800
I saw this in St.
Cloud.

65
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,573
This was going on.
This insane clown posse guy tried to 

66
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,434
drop kick Fred durst.
He wasn't even looking at them running 

67
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,620
headstart and Mrs.
Look her.

68
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,640
I was like,
what?

69
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,140
And he just kept going.
I haven't seen drag that dude off.

70
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,190
I mean that is maybe the worst public 
drop kick in the history of the world.

71
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,890
I think they meant he dropped when he 
tried to kick while he tried.

72
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,360
That was a classic dropkick classic pro 
wrestling dropkick.

73
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,194
But his problem is he threw it like a 
pro wrestler would where you don't 

74
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,940
really hit the guy.
You know what I mean?

75
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:36,940
Just kinda touched him.
And if Fred was playing along,

76
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,740
it would have been awesome.
We need a slow mo re.

77
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,380
Fred would have went flying and it would
have been,

78
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,450
you know,
fuck.

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,650
I think a lot of the lot of the,
uh,

80
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,060
the thing that's going through people's 
minds too is when you're in a fight like

81
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,894
that,
there's a lot of people in the crowd 

82
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,400
that can throw down.
It's not like,

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,010
you know,
you go to a well if you go to a hard,

84
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,893
a hard rock concert of any kind,
Clay Guido is going to be there 

85
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,600
somewhere obviously,
but as long as you can avoid clay,

86
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,493
like your opportunity of finding a guy 
that can really throw cuffs is going to 

87
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,340
be way smaller than when you're at the 
UFC and you look around.

88
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,900
It's hard not to see cauliflower ear.
So I mean someone who's in the crowd,

89
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,210
that's just a shit talker.
He knows.

90
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:24,211
If I just turn around and talk shit,
I can get wrapped up and be dead quick.

91
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,150
Yeah.
That's a very high number of people that

92
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,190
could fuck you up.
And one of those events,

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,880
it's probably like 30 percent,
30 percent of the people in the audience

94
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,890
actually know how to fight.
That's high.

95
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,860
I think that I think it'd be higher at a
UFC,

96
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,890
at least a basic.
I think it's about 30,

97
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,443
I'd say about 30 percent.
I feel like if you just like parcy 

98
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:47,610
audience out,
like how many,

99
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,770
how many you guys ever been punched?
How many guys ever fuck somebody up.

100
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,460
How many guys actually trained?
How many guys know how to train and like

101
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,800
do it on a regular basis.
How many guys are in shape?

102
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,903
Like if shit went down,
how many guys could actually throw down 

103
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,370
for a solid 37 days.
Yeah,

104
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,660
that's,
that's,

105
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,070
that's where you,
that's where I would shine.

106
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,850
I'm going to ride this out for two 
minutes and then these,

107
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,723
these draft elk legs are getting ready 
to frigging started dancing on some 

108
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,463
April.

109
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,890
Let's beat the spazz out for a little 
while and then,

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,630
then I'm good people,
you know,

111
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,170
when people were talking about,
um,

112
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,073
like uh,
connor in his conditioning for this 

113
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:25,331
fight.
Like,

114
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:29,230
one of the things that I'm Cam Cam Hanes
said was like,

115
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,060
you know,
he needs to start running,

116
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:32,470
like go,
go run in the hills.

117
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,680
And my dad ain't going to help.
Like,

118
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,410
it would help some.
But the thing is,

119
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:41,170
when someone's wrestling you and they're
on top of you,

120
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:44,370
fucking you up like that,
you just get,

121
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,413
you're just getting drained.
It's like a vampire just sucking blood 

122
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:49,910
out of you.
Yeah,

123
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,990
you're exhausted.
You carrying all their weight and you're

124
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,980
getting beat up and you're stressed and 
you know you're trying to.

125
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,290
And you can't breathe well because the 
person's weight is on top of you,

126
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,243
so you're not getting like real breaths 
and you're constantly resisting their 

127
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:05,474
weight.
And it's way easier for them that it is 

128
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:07,994
for you.
It's way easy to stay on top than it is 

129
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:11,600
to be on the bottom.
It's a disaster.

130
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,400
Well,

131
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,560
people that grew up wrestling,
you know,

132
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:17,090
you look at Miller Mendez,
Quita,

133
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,113
um,
those guys have experienced that 

134
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,810
forever.
Like it's,

135
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,760
it's ingrained in them.
Most wrestlers don't lose like a classic

136
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,830
wrestling physique.
Even as adults,

137
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,770
they still look like they're,
like,

138
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,080
they were guys that were real athletic 
at one time.

139
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,980
I remember one of the first things my 
dad taught me,

140
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,080
you know,
when I was younger in school,

141
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,240
he's like,
uh,

142
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,223
you know,
I think it was after the first guy 

143
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,020
wanted to fight me on the playground.
He's like,

144
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,003
you know,
if you don't know if the guy's good at 

145
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,273
fighting,
don't worry about it unless he's a 

146
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:51,790
wrestler.
He's like,

147
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,550
just if it's a wrestler,
try to back down.

148
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,120
He's like,
you don't know what to do.

149
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,870
Smart.
And Yeah,

150
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,713
it was classic this,
this weekend when I was watching that 

151
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,234
fight.
I'm like,

152
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,470
okay,
here we go.

153
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:06,170
This is just a classic.
He's gonna,

154
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,210
you know,
connor had like 30 seconds,

155
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,510
they've started those rounds and then it
was just a mauling yeah.

156
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,730
Well John Cavanaugh,
who's connors trainer,

157
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:14,564
it will be here next.
He's going to be here at 11 and we'll 

158
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,910
get a chance to talk to him and see what
the fuck he thinks and what happened.

159
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,020
And the bottom line is that guy is so 
much better than him as a grappler.

160
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,820
So much better.
I mean he is on such a high level.

161
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,800
When I talked to Daniel Cormier,
Daniel called me.

162
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,643
He says that guy schools,
worldclass wrestlers in the gym just 

163
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,580
throws people around.
Yeah.

164
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,860
Assassins probably one after another.
Yeah.

165
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,180
He's just mentioned this training.

166
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,013
Special talent.
He's been wrestling since he was a 

167
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:47,600
little kid,
man.

168
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,493
I mean he really has this.
Have you ever seen the video of him 

169
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,810
wrestling a bear?
No,

170
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,320
but I want you to ever sell.
I know,

171
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:58,970
but I want to fucking hilarious.
It's him wrestling a brown bear.

172
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,110
It's like a small brown bear,
like a Russian brown bear.

173
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,363
Like our version of a grizzly in Russia 
and he's saying like coastal peninsula 

174
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:10,220
bear like a peninsula.
Yeah.

175
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,240
Look,
look,

176
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,690
what is that?
That's him.

177
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,880
When he's a little kid.
Look at this.

178
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,370
I mean,
first of all,

179
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,260
who the fuck lets their kid there and 
the bears bite them.

180
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,780
The Bear's bite and I'm looking as bare 
as biting his clothes.

181
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:30,770
Bears a total cheater which prepared 
them for connor this weekend.

182
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,013
Just kind of do a lot of cheating.
If I were to setup position would be 

183
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,390
making a bet.
He gave a position because of the bite.

184
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,480
You see that he was on top and the bear 
pit him and he let the get on top.

185
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,450
Now he's until it's over.
Look at this,

186
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,550
but it's not.
Bears are squirrely.

187
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:48,170
Man and bears have a really good guard.

188
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,350
He's laughing that at Sam as a little 
boy.

189
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,190
Look at that.
Nineteen 97.

190
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,530
See,
we can't do that stuff in America.

191
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,413
I know.
That's why.

192
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,350
I mean,
imagine if Mendez got to go out and just

193
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,220
wrestle bears.
Look how little he is too.

194
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,690
I mean,
he's a little kid there,

195
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,310
man.
He looks like he's about eight years old

196
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,173
actually.
I think in the neighborhood I grew up 

197
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,243
with the cheetahs.
They probably had one of these in the 

198
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,280
garage.
A bearer.

199
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,070
Yeah.
Clay and Jason.

200
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,650
They were both kind of nuts.
Maybe they did wrestle some barriers.

201
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,180
What state was it was in Illinois.
So that were the Johnsburg yeah.

202
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,920
Problem.
This is awesome.

203
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,530
It's crazy.
You know what's interesting?

204
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,670
I've been,
um,

205
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,593
why does he bite back?
Didn't get that training that don't do 

206
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,840
that because in the bear is really going
to get into looking at it.

207
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,550
We're just trying to bite his head.
He shifts just a little bear,

208
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,380
but his dad just like,
let them ride it out.

209
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,161
He said,
well,

210
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:47,710
the barrier is obviously being nice.
They're having fun and even though it's,

211
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,450
you know,
it's like when a dog's bite and you know

212
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,710
when you're playing with them and 
they're done,

213
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,710
they're not trying to hurt you.
Look at that,

214
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,770
but also on a chain which is kind of 
fucked up because the bear can't think.

215
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,140
I mean that beard,
that guard.

216
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,330
Very good.
Bears have a very good guard.

217
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,140
Look,
it says low.

218
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,890
I mean you.
Russians are fucking different.

219
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,150
Different breed and as things are hard 
over there,

220
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,020
we try to make things softer and softer.
Over here we're given kids participation

221
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:22,240
trophies.
We don't want bullying there.

222
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,050
They're like,
we're bringing the grizzly into assembly

223
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,970
and we're going to wrestle grizzlies 
today.

224
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,110
How old are you?
Eight.

225
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:29,310
And you have a restaurant,
grizzly yet.

226
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,570
What are you a pussy?
Yeah,

227
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,240
here we go.
A couple shots of vodka.

228
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,150
A grizzly bear or you're seeing a lot 
of.

229
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,133
Very,
very tough guys come from that part of 

230
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,880
the world and they're fighting in 
combat.

231
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,470
Just guys.
Women.

232
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:44,730
Yeah.
Not just guys.

233
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,660
And in as much as we're talking about 
wrestling,

234
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,610
he impressed me.
Stand up.

235
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,580
Oh yeah.
He cracked his right hand.

236
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,570
He,
he,

237
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,910
he,
he stood up enough to just say,

238
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,120
you know,
I'm going to sit here and take a few and

239
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:00,954
I'm going to give a few.
But then he went to probably what his 

240
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,410
game plan was,
I would assume.

241
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,423
Well you have to stand for a little 
while because if he just shoots in who 

242
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:10,740
get caught with a knee or caught with a 
punch rushing in.

243
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,870
But uh,
he,

244
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,390
I mean he landed the bigger shot.

245
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,170
There was one big giant shot that was 
landed in that fight and it was by hand.

246
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,550
He hit them with some pretty good front 
kick to the body and some other things,

247
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:25,470
but didn't really get much off on the 
feet.

248
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,333
Not like classic left Jabs that just 
break people down and on the ground he 

249
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,254
just got mall and it's one of those 
things where you see that guy in the 

250
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,424
beginning,
guys fight them off a little bit and 

251
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:38,004
then as the fight.
Whereas on he just gets more and more 

252
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,960
dominant.
They get more and more exhausted.

253
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,063
Really,
this fight just makes ally acquaint to 

254
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:46,830
look like a god.
I mean,

255
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,960
that's the most impressive thing about 
it.

256
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,740
Ally Quintin went five rounds with him,
stood toe to toe with him and you know,

257
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,360
gave him at least a struggle.
At least he gave him a bit of adversity,

258
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,453
you know,
managed to survive on the ground much 

259
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,020
better than conor did.

260
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,870
Manage to get back up to his feet,
manage the stuff,

261
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,470
a bunch of take downs and on the feet 
was a real threat,

262
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,623
you know,
I mean obviously Khabib didn't prepare 

263
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,210
for ally Quinta.
He prepared for Connor,

264
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,910
but ally acquainted didn't even prepare 
for five rounds.

265
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:20,260
The only prepared for three.
So there was so much to that fight.

266
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,020
What do you think will happen with 
conner now?

267
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,970
I'm worried.
What happens with Khabib,

268
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,840
I hope they sit everybody down and they 
go,

269
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,860
look.
Everybody's like,

270
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,840
all right,
come on,

271
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,153
you know.
So the guy who rushed into the cage and 

272
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,630
punch connor in the face,
that guy,

273
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,380
that guy should be in the most trouble 
because you know the guy just fought for

274
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,270
rounds,
got the fuck beaten out of them,

275
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,640
got choked.
I heard a lot of people.

276
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,160
There was a lot of silly non experts out
there saying that that wasn't a choke or

277
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,780
it wasn't a neck crank.

278
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,943
They don't know what the fuck they're 
talking about that that is absolutely a 

279
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,304
neck crank.
When someone gets their arm around your 

280
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:00,754
head like that,
and then what they do is they grab it 

281
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,174
like this and they pinched the elbow.
They put the forearm on his back like 

282
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:10,564
this.
So as the arm is across the neck and 

283
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,114
then they grip it like this and the 
forearm goes into the back and pulling 

284
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:17,644
like this.
You're pushing with your forum and 

285
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:19,774
Yanking with your hand is a terrible 
neck crank 'em they call dean lister 

286
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,700
actually has a video on it.
It's.

287
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,920
He calls it the fulcrum choke and it's a
nasty choke.

288
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:30,754
So you know,
I thought he was going under the neck 

289
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,570
here.
You could see it here,

290
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,210
dean lister,
who's a world champion,

291
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:40,900
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and uh,
that's my friend Hans.

292
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:43,300
Hans Mellencamp behind them and watch 
how he does it,

293
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:46,330
see how he's,
he's grabbing a hold of it.

294
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,630
And what he's gonna do is it's gonna 
clamp his hands,

295
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,100
cle grips his hands and so it crushes is
doing this.

296
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:53,611
No,
no,

297
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:54,190
no,
no.

298
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,023
You can go right over your face.
It can go over your neck and go over 

299
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,920
your face and go over your fucking 
cheekbones.

300
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,083
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't even have to go under the 

301
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:04,000
chin.
If it goes into the chin,

302
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:04,834
that's awesome,
but you see what's going on with his 

303
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,230
forearm.
See how he's pull,

304
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,720
push,
pull arms.

305
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,443
Well,
you could do it some.

306
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,293
Some guys do it like this,
but I think this is probably the best 

307
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,970
way to do it,
but as you're right here,

308
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:19,360
this part just digs that elbow.
Yeah.

309
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,860
Perfect.
Perfect example.

310
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,040
See,
he's pulling on it with his,

311
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,973
his right arm and then his left arm is 
pushing down with his forum on Connor 

312
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,760
Shoulder.
It is a nasty,

313
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,050
nasty neck crank and your head is 
getting popped off and first of all,

314
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:36,940
that guy could squeeze the shit out of 
you.

315
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,073
All you have to do,
there's a bunch of guys who could put 

316
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,460
you to sleep like that.
Marcello Garcia is one.

317
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,640
He puts guys a cease put guys to sleep 
without even getting under the chin.

318
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:46,474
He just gets your head.
Just get your head in there and 

319
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,900
squeezes.
Eddie Bravo can do that too.

320
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
If it gets your head in there,
you don't even

321
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,993
have to.
It doesn't even have to be under the 

322
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,434
chin.
He just really puts you to sleep with 

323
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:57,284
your own fucking head.
Just wraps it around your head and 

324
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,303
squeezes.
It's so tight that no blood is getting 

325
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:05,540
to your brain.
Yeah,

326
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,374
so there's a lot of armchair 
quarterbacks out there saying that that 

327
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:13,781
was a neck crank your incorrect and have
dean list to do that shit to you and you

328
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,540
will know the pressure I had Jocko do 
that to me.

329
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,880
My throat is still.
You don't want that.

330
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,800
No one will you rolling.
Which ACO?

331
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,440
That is a terrible idea.
Why did he,

332
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,780
why did he do that to you?
What did you do to him?

333
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,550
I don't know.
You were just trying to learn,

334
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:31,971
right?
Yeah,

335
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:33,490
I was trying to learn and I,
you know,

336
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,210
he said,
well who wants to roll?

337
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,140
And I just said me.
Yeah.

338
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,260
And he just,
he kind of just looked at me.

339
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:40,880
He's like,
well,

340
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,800
just try to do something,
but you're taking classes now,

341
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:47,420
right?
You taking 10th but I can.

342
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

343
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,510
We got one in Altoona,
Iowa.

344
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,660
So thanks to you and Eddie for hooking 
me up with Damien.

345
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,590
What?
Shout out.

346
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,060
Shout out to Damien.
What's super important is drilling those

347
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,170
the most important thing in the 
beginning.

348
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,660
It's sort of like,
uh,

349
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,770
uh,
there's,

350
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,270
there's parallels in archery for sure 
because archery,

351
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,600
it's what's really important is your 
technique.

352
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,350
Your technique is almost everything,
like doing everything correctly.

353
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,060
And that's the same thing with Jujitsu.
Same thing with Moitai,

354
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,290
taekwondo,
anything.

355
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,124
It's just technique and doing it over 
and over again correctly until it's 

356
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:27,440
ingrained in your system.

357
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,410
Yeah,
it's information overload for sure.

358
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,040
That's one of the hardest parts for me 
is I'm so new at it.

359
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,933
Then I feel like my cognitive 
functioning is not at a level to take 

360
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,364
in.
There's so much going on and several 

361
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:44,990
people have told me,
they're like,

362
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,883
they're.
There comes a point where all of a 

363
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:48,290
sudden it just,
it,

364
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,560
it's something clicks and you start to 
comprehend everything,

365
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,750
but until that moment happens,
it's,

366
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,673
you know,
you're going to struggle to remember 

367
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,220
what you talked about last time or how 
to do it exactly right.

368
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:02,750
But eventually there,
there comes a time when it clicks and it

369
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:03,770
starts to,
you know,

370
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,240
you do start to soak in stuff and I'm 
definitely not to that point yet.

371
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,240
I mean,
just even some of the basic drills,

372
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,074
the one thing I do understand that they 
were impressed by is just leverage on 

373
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:18,920
joints,
you know,

374
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,890
because they were talking about some of 
the different arm bars and stuff,

375
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,910
you know,
they were like,

376
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:24,620
well,
if the elbows like this,

377
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:25,101
and I said,
yeah,

378
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:26,990
that won't work.
The elbow has to be like this.

379
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:29,450
And I remember Damien looked at me like,
how do you know that?

380
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,021
And I'm like,
you know,

381
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,030
how many arms I've dissected off 
animals.

382
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,120
If you have to knock four hooves off of 
elk quarter to pack it out,

383
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,100
if you don't know where the joint is and
how to,

384
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,280
how to bend it and hit it just right to 
crack that off.

385
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,960
That's a good point.
And you know,

386
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,490
hips,
shoulders,

387
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,980
even taking the head off.
I mean,

388
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,130
you know,
I think

389
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,963
that too,
but also your understanding of like the 

390
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:56,880
proper positioning of your shoulders in 
your elbow and everything in archery.

391
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,300
I think just an understanding of the 
human body alone.

392
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,330
I think that that helps you 
tremendously.

393
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,930
It's one of the reasons why people that 
are really good at gymnastics.

394
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:10,660
Excel at Jujitsu,
people were really good at break dance.

395
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,030
I saw that.
Yeah.

396
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:13,980
Breakdancers excel.
Um,

397
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:15,750
Yoga,
a lot of yoga people,

398
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,050
they get really good at yoga.
They can excel at Jujitsu to.

399
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:19,920
It's just you,
you have a,

400
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:24,120
just an understanding of what the way 
your body moves in my mind,

401
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,973
both mind body connection,
like being able to really have a mind 

402
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,780
muscle connection.
And some people don't understand that.

403
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,290
You tell them to do a pull up and you're
like,

404
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,880
you really want to use lattes?
And they're like,

405
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,710
well,
what's that?

406
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,370
Yeah.
They don't know.

407
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,480
They have no idea.
Yeah.

408
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:41,700
They just pull in.
And some people when they,

409
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,650
when they pull a boat for the first 
time,

410
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,663
even big guys,
they struggle pulling a boat because 

411
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,900
they're not their techniques.
Poor.

412
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,060
So they're,
you know,

413
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,640
they're lifting apart or pulling all 
with bicep down and it's like,

414
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,474
man,
can you just lift up and goes straight 

415
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,210
back with,
you know,

416
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,660
just certain muscles of the back.
And when they see it they're like,

417
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,613
how do you do that?
And it's just understanding of leverage 

418
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,973
in muscle and then you know,
once they understand that flow it gets 

419
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:08,514
really easy.
But until that it looks like they're 

420
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:15,540
trying to literally do a Max rep gets 
that too.

421
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,374
But it's also,
you probably have done it a million 

422
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:23,700
times so your arms are so conditioned to
do that.

423
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,140
It's such a natural movement.
Possibly.

424
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,840
Most.
Probably several million.

425
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
Yeah.
I would say probably several.

426
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,950
Well here's a perfect example of use.
Most people,

427
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,200
even if they have like a strong left 
arm,

428
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,610
like if I go back,
flex your arm,

429
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,030
you see a good left Bicep,
you know you look got good shoulders and

430
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:39,864
you left hand.
And then I bring you to a heavy bag and 

431
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:45,600
I say throw a left hook.
Most people's left hooks are fucking dog

432
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,210
shit.
Just straight up talk shit.

433
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,170
Hit somebody to throw out there.
Like it just,

434
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,680
it just doesn't work.
It doesn't like someone throw a baseball

435
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,390
lefthanded.
It just looks terrible.

436
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,283
It's even worse.
I think you might be able to throw 

437
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,910
because the concept of throwing seems 
normal.

438
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,060
But the concept of digging in with your 
toes and turning your body into the hook

439
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,250
and then if you do it and you just do it
slowly,

440
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,110
just bang and hit a bag.

441
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,310
They're like,
how are you doing that?

442
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,380
And he just like,
you just get used to it.

443
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,470
For the [inaudible] when I was,
when I was striking all the time,

444
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,590
my left bicep was quite a bit larger 
than my right one.

445
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,090
My left arm was actually stronger than 
my right because you're always jabbing,

446
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,143
you always jabbing,
jabbing and hooking and you throwing 

447
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:34,260
less right hands and you are left hands.
And so my left side was bigger,

448
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,990
like my left arm.
I had a bit like I could see it.

449
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,063
Like if I flex the two of them together,
my left bicep look larger and that's a 

450
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:43,300
normal thing with boxers.
They're there.

451
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,183
If you,
if you're not a person switch the 

452
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:49,660
stances and you yourself in an orthodox 
stance with your left leg forward,

453
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,550
you will,
you'll have a stronger lefthand.

454
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,553
Like I would be able to open things 
better with my left hand and my right 

455
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,630
hand.

456
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,500
Not Weird.
Well,

457
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,011
I mean,
yeah,

458
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:59,410
you're in your,
you're turning so much too,

459
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:02,950
so I mean I guess when you're snapping 
back you're kind of soup and aiding the.

460
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,680
When you come back think it's just the 
use,

461
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,080
just the sheer number,
like the.

462
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,370
If you looked at like a really good box 
or left hand versus right hand,

463
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,100
you might throw two to one,
maybe three to one,

464
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,110
three,
11 slash three to three to one.

465
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,840
Yeah.
If you're doing it right,

466
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,733
you know you're supposed to be jabbing 
more than you are just throwing 

467
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,520
haymakers.
Well one of my,

468
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,383
one of the highlights of the fight there
were several Ferguson's match was 

469
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,270
amazing.
Ferguson's incredible.

470
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,890
I mean incredible too.
That guy had catastrophic knee surgery,

471
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,920
like his knee was so blown out.
They were,

472
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,780
they were not sure if he was going to be
able to fight again.

473
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,053
They were like,
I don't know what's gonna happen here 

474
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:47,020
because he had ripped his tendon 
completely off the bone.

475
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,850
The scar on his leg is enormous.
His scars like 12 inches long,

476
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,203
that fucking massive scar.
So they had to open him up like a fish 

477
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,393
and then they have to get in there and 
they have to bolt down that ligament to 

478
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:01,600
the,
to the bone.

479
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,820
Were they able to use the same one back 
down?

480
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah.
I mean he had surgery almost immediately

481
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:07,834
after the injury.
He didn't have to have a cadaver or 

482
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,310
anything like that and the way they do.
Uh,

483
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,353
I don't,
I honestly don't know exactly what was 

484
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,010
involved.
But look at that knee.

485
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,690
Cut The fucking name,
man.

486
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,600
That's incredible.
That's,

487
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:23,770
I mean,
that is incredible.

488
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,940
And then six months later he's not just 
healed up.

489
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,310
He's got Anthony Pettis kicking that 
leg.

490
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,410
Yeah.
We're very concerned in the beginning of

491
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,244
the fight,
it looked like he got hurt on that leg 

492
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,593
because pedes hit that leg twice really 
hard and it looked like he was wobbly a 

493
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:46,390
little bit on that leg was going to say 
he survived a catastrophic flurry.

494
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,410
Yeah,
I mean that is caught him.

495
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,283
Yeah.
He came back big time because it didn't 

496
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:52,984
look good.
There were several fighters that dug 

497
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,960
really deep that we're in trouble and 
came back for some awesome.

498
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,400
Come back about Derrick Lewis.
He's the best.

499
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,270
He's the best.
He's my official favorite now.

500
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,910
I love that.
That fucking post fight interviews.

501
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:09,370
My favorite posts for sure.
I go,

502
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,720
Derek,
why'd you take your shorts off?

503
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,930
I'm a balls was hot.
I love that.

504
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,773
I got a phone call before to fight.
Donald trump called me and said I got 

505
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,120
knocked this Russia motherfucker out and
make get everybody look bad.

506
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,120
When I was putting shit,
I was in the crowd and I'm like.

507
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,270
I looked at Sharon,
say his balls were.

508
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,650
She's like,
yeah.

509
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,970
She goes,
I think he did.

510
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,350
Yeah,
he put the crowd.

511
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:37,400
I don't think appreciated it as much as 
the people back home.

512
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:38,234
It was hard to hear people back home.
They got it straight from his mic into 

513
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:43,840
their TV.
They got the full version of it.

514
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,890
Yeah.
It was muffled.

515
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,750
Pretty hardcore,
but so classic.

516
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,880
He so funny man.
And,

517
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,880
and what a fucking punch her.
Holy Shit.

518
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,130
Holy Shit.
Can that guy crack?

519
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,010
Because he was down as down as you can 
get.

520
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,140
I mean,
he's basically three rounds in the cam,

521
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,770
three rounds in the hole and 30 seconds 
to go.

522
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,093
We were saying that we were saying it in
the commentary that he still has the 

523
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:14,150
kind of power where one shot could win 
the fight and people like,

524
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:14,751
yeah,
yeah,

525
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,640
yeah.
But as you're going to live,

526
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,670
that's what's hard about being live at 
the fight.

527
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,140
You,
um,

528
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,453
you don't really get the commentary and 
your guys's commentary so good when 

529
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:28,824
you're watching on paper view,
it's dissecting so many things that you 

530
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,581
aren't,
you know,

531
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:35,730
unless you're a very seasoned at 
watching mma,

532
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,680
you don't appreciate a lot of that 
stuff.

533
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,230
And when you're watching with no one's 
opinion,

534
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,393
you're kind of just watching and waiting
for something like that to happen where 

535
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,843
there's a lot of times you guys are 
calling that you're seeing some of that 

536
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,220
stuff that needs to happen or should 
happen.

537
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:52,230
And they used to have this thing that 
you could get.

538
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:55,140
I don't think they have it anymore.
It was like a little FM radio.

539
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:57,080
Did you see it at the scene?
It in a while?

540
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,530
No,
I don't think they have it anymore,

541
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,350
but it used to be a little thing that 
you would,

542
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,213
you would buy at the gift shop,
so like a little in a doubled as an FM 

543
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,504
radio,
so if you used it like it would still 

544
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:08,994
would work somewhere else as a radio,
but when you keep it on a certain 

545
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:12,114
frequency,
they would broadcast the commentary so 

546
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:15,294
you would get the commentary and you can
keep it in your ear while the fight was 

547
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:18,600
going on.

548
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,433
Yeah,
that is one of the things that that's 

549
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:23,270
missing just a little bit.
Yeah,

550
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,450
but it's just there's something about 
being in the building.

551
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,000
Especially that one.
Yeah,

552
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,400
there was just electricity,
like Sha radiating from person to person

553
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:35,910
in the crowd.
It was electric.

554
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,600
Yeah.
That was probably the biggest UFC of all

555
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:42,750
time.
I mean it has to be one of them,

556
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,720
you know,
they don't know.

557
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,643
I won't know for another day or so,
but I think it's the most important 

558
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:53,981
fight of all time because connor being 
such a huge superstar and then being out

559
00:25:55,011 --> 00:26:00,011
of mma for two solid years and then 
Khabib just being so dominant 26 and.

560
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,443
Oh,
and then there was also like the 

561
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,990
controversy of like how he won the 
title.

562
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,940
You know,
he won the title last minute.

563
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,740
He was supposed to be fighting Tony 
Ferguson.

564
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,603
Tony gets injured,
ally Quinta steps up and it's further 

565
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,260
title and everyone is like,
what?

566
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,430
How is that for the title?

567
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,480
Yeah.
You know,

568
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,770
the whole thing was just very,
very weird.

569
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,873
If there's not a,
a rematch which you would think numbers 

570
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:25,930
wise,
there has to be.

571
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,240
I don't think so.
I wouldn't think there'd be a rematch.

572
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:29,860
Not for a long time.
Well,

573
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:30,694
what's awesome is if there isn't and 
counter the counter politics or out of 

574
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:39,771
that weight class now some of the fights
we'd get to see like I'd love to see him

575
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,110
in Ferguson would be bringing fight.
That's

576
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,850
a fight 100 percent now after ferguson 
dominated pedis like that.

577
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:50,550
And then also overcame that big shot 
where he got hurt.

578
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,920
Yeah,
I don't.

579
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,870
I don't want to see mcgregor versus can 
be begin.

580
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
I don't think he was going to be any 
different.

581
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,950
There's so many more that would just be 
awesome.

582
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,170
I would like to see it in the future.
I mean,

583
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:04,800
but connor would have to do something to
show that he,

584
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,813
first of all,
there is absolutely a factor in that he 

585
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,640
had not been fighting for two years.
Yeah.

586
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,000
One boxing match in two years is just 
not good enough for MMA.

587
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,370
Especially with wrestling.
Just not good enough.

588
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,870
And then I think he would have to like 
really,

589
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:28,620
really concentrate on is wrestling and 
even that.

590
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,031
Even that.
I mean,

591
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:31,990
how much better can you get,
dude?

592
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,440
That guy was wrestling a bear as a kid.

593
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,720
I mean,
he's so much better.

594
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,673
Yeah.
He's going to have to go back in time 

595
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,850
and rethink this.
I mean,

596
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:43,770
Khabib might just have his number for 
life,

597
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,490
you know,
that's what [inaudible] said.

598
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,720
You know,
I was talking for me after the fight,

599
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:49,710
he said,
he was like,

600
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,510
listen to me.
He's never going to beat him.

601
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,610
Never.
He's never going to beat him.

602
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,953
I go,
you don't think you can ever get to the 

603
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:58,320
point where he'd get his take down 
defense up enough.

604
00:27:58,321 --> 00:27:59,610
He's like,
it'll never happen.

605
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,500
He's never going to get there.
It's too far away.

606
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,510
He's got to get a just a clean one shot 
that just ends up.

607
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,260
That would be it.
It's like that in my field too.

608
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,970
I mean I stay.
I guess I stay honed,

609
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,790
but I'm not like razor sharp in my 
field.

610
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,850
Just so like you mean like target 
archery?

611
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,090
Like if you're going to compete.
Yeah.

612
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:22,340
People all the time say,
why don't you,

613
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,233
why don't you compete in it?
Can I shoot better than most people at 

614
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:30,080
this point?
Yeah,

615
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,590
I can answer that without question.
Can I shoot at a,

616
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,700
at a word?
Like could I have beat myself when I was

617
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:39,050
shooting on the teams?
No Way.

618
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,770
Like that was a different person and 
when I stepped away for,

619
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,910
for two or three years,
even though I contemplated coming back,

620
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:50,540
I'm like,
this commitment is going to take a year,

621
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,570
two years of really fine tuning because 
I mean at those levels,

622
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,340
people don't miss,
you know,

623
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,280
so missing one or two still means it's a
weekend,

624
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,173
it's still a tournament,
like you have to be flawless and if 

625
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:08,390
you're not flawless then all you're 
doing is donating money.

626
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,580
And when you compete in those 
tournaments with the distance,

627
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,370
it depended.
There were several different formats,

628
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,293
um,
anywhere from 18 meters which you were 

629
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:20,090
shooting at something the size of a dime
in most of those,

630
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,540
you know,
like a 600 round you would need to be,

631
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,640
you know.
Then I was shooting like,

632
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,520
you know,
upper five nineties,

633
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,730
I'm at something the size of time 
explaining what that means.

634
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,770
So like to hit that,
hit that exercise of a dime as a 10.

635
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,570
So you would have to,
you know,

636
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,520
literally says she times,
yeah,

637
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,110
out of arrows in,
in like in tournament play,

638
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:46,480
you would have to hit that dime,
you know,

639
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,780
57 times.
Um,

640
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,090
and then when we went out to the longer 
distances up to 90 meters,

641
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,353
I mean,
you have to be shooting something a 

642
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:59,980
little bit larger than the end of that 
Coffee Cup.

643
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,180
You know,
you'd have to,

644
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,250
you'd have to be deadly accurate with 
that thing.

645
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:04,880
I mean,
you're going to have to be in,

646
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,020
in the high 90 percentile of being able 
to hit that

647
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,790
and you also get used to the 
competition.

648
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:14,510
You get sharper because your minds in 
that place that all the time,

649
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,270
that's the hardest part.
Even if you're on the game,

650
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:20,640
which there's been times like this past 
summer,

651
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,010
um,
I had a event that I did for um,

652
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,923
a Cabela's experience where some of the 
Kybella is black signature card members 

653
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,870
kind of,
I guess bought an experience.

654
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,870
And I did some training at the Easton 
Center with them.

655
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:36,480
And then we went and shot the total 
archery challenge in,

656
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,670
in Utah.
And we talked,

657
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,430
I talked through the technicalities of 
what you would do on each shot,

658
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,583
what the total archery challenges for 
total archery challenge is a tournament 

659
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,530
that order's not even a tournament.
It's more of a fun event where they set,

660
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,590
it's in snowbird and they set archery 
targets like in real hunting situations,

661
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,570
but with very,
very technical shots,

662
00:30:57,571 --> 00:31:00,360
extreme angles,
longer distances.

663
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,680
He got cross winds and canyons and 
snowbird from people don't know is a ski

664
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:05,514
course.
What does that actually have the video 

665
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,740
and uh,
yeah,

666
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:12,500
it's just very technical because

667
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,560
you're the footings poor.
Yeah.

668
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,760
This is a,
this is the total archery challenge.

669
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:20,000
So it's really interesting because it's 
in the summertime,

670
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,700
but it's at a ski place,
a ski range,

671
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,930
what would you call it?
A Ski,

672
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,610
what'd you call it?
Yes,

673
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,750
of course.
No,

674
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,820
it's a,
it's a ski lodge.

675
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:29,710
Yeah.
But what is,

676
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,330
what is where the,
where the flips.

677
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,800
It's literally a resort.
Yeah.

678
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,683
Snowbird.
So you take the ski lifts up to where 

679
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:40,400
these things are.
And uh,

680
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,350
these targets are all set up.
There were all these foam deer and foam,

681
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,090
sheep and all these different game 
animals and they're at extreme distances

682
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,270
and weird angles.
You take

683
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,233
the,
uh,

684
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,123
take the tram all the way to the top of 
the mountain and then you literally 

685
00:31:57,831 --> 00:32:00,650
shoot down.
I think it was about six miles for us to

686
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:03,230
get down.
I think our total walk one day was about

687
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:05,250
six miles.
Um,

688
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,260
but I shot it with this group and taught
them the technicalities of it.

689
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,010
And because of that I really wanted to 
be prepared.

690
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:15,320
I knew that there was going to be people
there watching.

691
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:16,154
I knew that because I stepped into an 
actual event where there were a few 

692
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,953
thousand archers there.
I knew that there was going to be a lot 

693
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:26,810
of people watching me because I haven't 
gone out into that realm in a while.

694
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,390
It would be no different than a false 
and you know,

695
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,310
you were out of mma for awhile and then 
went in there,

696
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,920
you know,
there's going to be eyes on you.

697
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,000
So I just wanted to be on my game,
um,

698
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,430
or as best as I could be.
So I've set a goal,

699
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,360
I'm trying to think what it was.
I think I set a goal of like,

700
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,340
I think it was around 10,000
arrows I wanted to shoot prior to that.

701
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,650
I'm so over a course of just a few 
months.

702
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,551
Yeah,
I mean,

703
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:58,880
I think the one day I shot round $500 a 
day.

704
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,950
A tie.
I think a timelapse one of those,

705
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:02,940
I don't know if you remember that.
Um,

706
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,430
but once you go there,
even if you're totally on your game,

707
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:12,770
if you have to shoot with other guys 
that are elite level athletes,

708
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,620
there's still a lot that goes into it.
I mean that.

709
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:17,360
And especially if you're shooting for 
score,

710
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,960
you're shooting for money.
Those pressure factors,

711
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:21,794
if you're not acclimated to them,
those aren't things that you can just 

712
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:25,370
step back into.

713
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,900
When I was my best as a competitor,
I always like,

714
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:34,901
my practice was almost at tournaments.
Every weekend it was 40 something events

715
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:38,660
a year.
You know,

716
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,583
every three days you're at a tournament 
in the heat of the moment with the best 

717
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,950
five or six people in the world and then
you go home for a few days to repack you

718
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:51,590
retune and then you're right back in the
grind again,

719
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,620
somebody's got stripped of a title 
because they tested positive for thc and

720
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:59,000
Beta blockers.
This is real recent,

721
00:33:59,001 --> 00:33:59,834
right?
Oh yeah,

722
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,220
yeah.
When I competed.

723
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,720
Um,
so I mean,

724
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:03,554
yeah,
you a year depending on what level 

725
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:09,310
you're at.
There was because I shot with the U,

726
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:10,144
s team,
certain tournament's didn't have doping 

727
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,280
and then.
But when you shot anything that was on a

728
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:19,340
world level you did.
So I was always in a doping pool,

729
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:22,490
so it was no different than like when I 
was,

730
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,390
I was,
uh,

731
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,540
with Chad Mendez at a Turkey hunt and he
made a testing pool.

732
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

733
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,390
So they would test your blood or your 
urine.

734
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:30,650
What would the test?
Either one.

735
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,600
Yeah.
And you'd be on call,

736
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,940
you'd have to live with Beta blockers.
What does that,

737
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,210
what do they do you ever told that?
Know that it's supposed to kill alarms,

738
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,690
right?
I would think it blocks adrenaline,

739
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,973
right?
The ability for your brain to dump 

740
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,310
adrenaline.
So yeah,

741
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:47,144
the,
the number one thing in archery or any 

742
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:51,690
type of finesse sport is,
you know,

743
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:56,310
low heart rate keeping your heart rate 
down because that's obviously keeping,

744
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,980
you know,
keeping your mind in the game.

745
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,960
Um,
and stability.

746
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,810
Very minimal movements.
So yeah,

747
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:03,650
there's,
um,

748
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,770
I remember I had a coach a long time 
ago,

749
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,693
he talked about um,
alcohol and how alcohol could help 

750
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,153
shooter because we,
we were talking about a guy that had 

751
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:15,740
done well at tournament several times 
and I said,

752
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:16,930
yeah,
he always does.

753
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,751
And he said,
yeah,

754
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:19,760
he's always,
he's always drunk.

755
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,040
And I'm like,
what do you mean?

756
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:22,940
And he said,
well,

757
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,803
he goes,
if you play alcohol the right way and 

758
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:29,330
you're like,
not sloppy drunk,

759
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:30,550
but you're,
he goes,

760
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,371
he goes,
yeah,

761
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:35,240
he just stays in his zone.
And he just kinda sitting there drinking

762
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:36,074
the whole time.
And that was like prior to where they 

763
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:41,460
were testing for alcohol.
So he actually made us,

764
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,720
uh,
he said,

765
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:44,390
all right,
well let's see how you,

766
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,590
how you do if you shoot when you have a 
buzz going.

767
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:47,840
So,
you know,

768
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:51,060
we,
we drank and shot and uh,

769
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,980
you know,
don't try this at home kids,

770
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,820
it wasn't an archery range where they 
have to buy insurance or whatever.

771
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,140
But uh,
yeah,

772
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:59,010
and it,
you know,

773
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,970
that was part of it because at the time 
this was in the mid nineties,

774
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,153
another archer that had won a bunch of 
titles also tested positive for Beta 

775
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:12,000
blockers and had some title stripped.

776
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,583
But then for the longest time that was 
one of my complaints was once I was 

777
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,350
shooting,
I'm at a level with,

778
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,560
with the teams and we had to go through 
testing or be like if,

779
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,110
for example,
at an event when I met old,

780
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,960
if you're in the top three,
immediately you get tested.

781
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,400
I mean,
so that's how it is.

782
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,580
So you know,
everyone there is level,

783
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,430
they're all level,
but then you go to other events.

784
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:39,264
Like for example,
some of the biggest money events were 

785
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:42,894
the three d shoots and that was a big 
reason why I left those sheets because 

786
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:49,110
at those tournaments there was no 
testing,

787
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,273
there was no testing,
there was clearly guys there that were 

788
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,930
shooting that we're kind of just out of 
it.

789
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,600
There could be $50,000
on the line and there was just no,

790
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,060
not a sweat cracked because there were 
some of that stuff.

791
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,923
Obviously it is a performance enhancer 
because of the fact they're not having 

792
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:08,214
to deal with adrenaline spikes and 
accelerated heart rate for people don't 

793
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:12,684
know what we're talking about.
Three d shoots are a type of tournament 

794
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:18,600
where they have those,
a realistic looking targets.

795
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,350
So foam elks or a foam bear and they 
have,

796
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,540
you know,
areas that you're supposed to hit.

797
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,290
Yeah.
And,

798
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,123
and um,
the other thing was I didn't like the 

799
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:31,920
fact that I'm at that time when you 
scored,

800
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:34,950
it was just based off if there's four 
guys in the group,

801
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,530
whatever the majority voted,
that's how it's scored.

802
00:37:37,531 --> 00:37:38,364
And when there's a lot of money online.
So like say you shot and I shot Jamie 

803
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:46,170
shop and Sharon shot,
we'd walk up and you know,

804
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:50,340
it's their phone ring so the era could 
look like it's in,

805
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:51,174
it could look like it's out,
but it's not a clear line and we would 

806
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:54,540
just,
if me,

807
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,030
you and Jamie said that's out.

808
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,410
Then even if Sharon's was close,
it'd be out.

809
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,520
Um,
so I was in some groups where things got

810
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:03,354
a little shady.
People are wanting to make money and it 

811
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:08,910
got a parent that it wasn't,
there wasn't a judge.

812
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,744
They're calling every score,
which on a world level there's judges 

813
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:14,544
there.
So if you guys were all competing 

814
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:17,220
against each other,
you would call for each other.

815
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,370
I've seen groups where they did.
Oh,

816
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:21,640
that's cool.
Yeah,

817
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,160
yeah,
yeah.

818
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,520
I've seen groups where they.
Do you ever tried their Beta blocker?

819
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,230
No.
I want to know what that's like.

820
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,430
I'd like to do something nerve wracking,
try a Beta blocker and then do something

821
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,293
fucking really.
Nerve wracking can mean any throw you 

822
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:35,634
out of

823
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,153
please.
I think you would like it whether I'd 

824
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:42,760
like it or not.
It's not happening.

825
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,530
Well,
not interested.

826
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,650
It doesn't get much sketchier than that 
roller coaster we're on.

827
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:50,110
Yesterday we did the rollercoaster at 
New York,

828
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:51,590
New York,
oof,

829
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,113
sketch city.
That thing felt like it was tied 

830
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:59,971
together with Bubblegum floss.
It feels so uncomfortable.

831
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:02,254
You're like,
wait a minute.

832
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,790
This is just way it's old.
It's outside.

833
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,783
Everything is outside.
You're flying around the casino itself 

834
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,430
like and the whole thing just feels like
it shouldn't be there.

835
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,293
Yeah.
I think there's several things there 

836
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,220
that are a little outdated.
Yeah.

837
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,360
Yeah.
I was in the,

838
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,030
I was,
I was one row behind you guys and uh,

839
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,523
I was next to this kid who had never 
ridden a rollercoaster and he was 

840
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:32,950
terrified.
He was terrified and I thought,

841
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,353
have I just not been on one of these 
long for that long to where this feels 

842
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:38,344
like it could possibly shake off and we 
could launch on like what was the last 

843
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:44,740
time a rollercoaster did break loose?

844
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,180
Like when was the last side of someone 
or something?

845
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,900
Last year,
I believe it happened.

846
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,960
Something happened last year.
Don't show him one of those carnivals.

847
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,640
Roll into town.
Yeah,

848
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,593
that's on you.
If you get on one of those fucking 

849
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:01,594
things.
I was at one a couple of years back and 

850
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:07,960
I took a picture of it for instagram 
because there was a.

851
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,620
This one of those whirlwind things.
Oh,

852
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,493
rollercoaster derails to writers.
Fall 30 feet to the ground and Daytona 

853
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:16,120
beach.
Oh,

854
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,030
don't show me this either.
That's just afterwards.

855
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,750
Oh,
that's it.

856
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,830
Hanging.
Got the live video.

857
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,510
Oh Jesus Christ.
Daytona beach.

858
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:26,344
But that's Florida.
See anything that's fucked up could 

859
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:30,754
happen in Florida.
I guarantee that guy was fixing that on 

860
00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:33,544
oxycontin.
It's probably got a python in his 

861
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:37,810
pocket.
Fucking assholes.

862
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,793
They need one of those in the buckies.
Do they have a rollercoaster in a 

863
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:42,280
buckies yet?

864
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,590
No.
They don't need one.

865
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,270
Just Texas.
Texas is not known for roller coasters.

866
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,270
That a little wiser than that.
I bet you could wrestle grizzly bears in

867
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:54,820
Texas though.
Like if someone wanted to train.

868
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:55,803
Oh yeah.
You could probably shoot them to do 

869
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:58,260
whatever you want.
Yeah.

870
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,260
We could do a brown bear wrestling 
training camp.

871
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,170
It's an exotic.
That's the whole thing about Texas,

872
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,470
like if thing,
if it's an exotic animal,

873
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,590
meaning it's not indigenous,
not native,

874
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,420
you can kind of do whatever the fuck you
want to.

875
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,570
It is crazy.
Text is a fascinating place.

876
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,800
It's one of the weird states that almost
all the land is private.

877
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,200
That's,
that's a rare thing.

878
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,063
Like there's a public land system in 
this country with the bureau of land 

879
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:33,380
management and all the different

880
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,980
national parks.
There's like none of that in Texas.

881
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,910
You know,
Texas is mostly just private ranches.

882
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,523
That's weird.
Right?

883
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,693
It's very weird.
It's very weird that there's been roads 

884
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:46,724
I've been down where you're just driving
and for miles and miles and miles is 

885
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:52,430
nothing but high fence.
It's like people's private ranch is just

886
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:54,350
like gated in.
Yeah.

887
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,373
You know,
it's strange because they have these 

888
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:01,541
ranches that they seem like wilderness 
because the ranch will be like 10,000

889
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:03,920
acres.
Right.

890
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,630
But if it's 10,000
acres,

891
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:08,240
it's fenced in and party.
He goes,

892
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:08,751
well,
hey man,

893
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:11,360
the whole country's fed fenced in.
He gets to the ocean.

894
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:12,194
He can't go any further.
That shit's Kinda like a third that 

895
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:16,310
excuse,
but there you guys how I look at it,

896
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,500
you go far enough north,
you hit the ice,

897
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,660
he hit the glaciers.
Yeah.

898
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,990
Where you going?
Yeah.

899
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,860
But there's something about that kind of
experience.

900
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,693
Like that's one of the weirdest things 
about Texas is that they have these 

901
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,833
enormous fenced in properties where they
have all these African animals running 

902
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:38,084
around,
like Neil guy and Elan's and you name 

903
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:41,711
it.
Yeah.

904
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:43,410
And they're,
they're zebra.

905
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,293
More of those animals running around in 
Texas than they do in the wild of their 

906
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,140
countries.
Like oryx,

907
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:52,940
oryx.
They're like,

908
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,220
they're threatened in other parts of the
world.

909
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,230
Right.
They've got a ton of them down there,

910
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,900
Texas.
They got up fuck load and black books.

911
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,860
Yeah,
lots of stuff.

912
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,113
Yeah.
They have lots of stuff access the same 

913
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:04,041
way,
but.

914
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,220
So how do you feel about that?
Like if you,

915
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,290
if the place is like this is like a 
philosophical argument,

916
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,850
right?
If it's 10,000

917
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:11,684
acres and it's fenced in,
that's far greater than their natural 

918
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:16,520
range,
right?

919
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,383
Yeah.
Normally wouldn't wander any further 

920
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:21,980
than that.
It's an ongoing debate.

921
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,480
I mean,
it is Squirrelly,

922
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:24,050
right?
Yeah,

923
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,610
it's squirly.
Yeah.

924
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:26,444
There's um,
because even with like animals that 

925
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:30,171
they,
you know,

926
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:33,530
where they want to score and then put 
into the record books,

927
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,780
you know,
to keep track of scores.

928
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,200
So,
you know,

929
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,083
there are certain score scoring clubs 
that don't recognize anything with a 

930
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:43,844
high fence,
but then at the same time there's 

931
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,450
members within those organizations that 
are like,

932
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:48,284
well,
wait a minute,

933
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:48,950
you know,
if,

934
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,570
uh,
ranches 15,000

935
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:52,100
acres that's,
you know,

936
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,990
they kind of have this same argument.
And they said,

937
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:54,681
well,
is that.

938
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:55,550
And it's like,
well,

939
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,490
yeah,
I mean if,

940
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,940
if there is.
And as a hunter,

941
00:43:58,941 --> 00:44:03,500
it's one of the things that um,
there's kind of a continual debate.

942
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,363
Some hunters absolutely refused to hunt 
anything that has any sort of 

943
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:12,650
containment.
Other people have their kind of,

944
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,710
their,
you know,

945
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,880
they have their own threshold of,
well if it's 5,000

946
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,320
or more than I'm kind of okay with it.

947
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,550
It's hard.
I mean,

948
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:23,930
it's no different than,
you know,

949
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:24,764
some people in the hunting community.
Some people only want to hunt animals 

950
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:29,954
that are on public land.
And then some people like to hunt areas 

951
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:35,631
where it's,
you know,

952
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,464
it's managed properties,
it's privately owned properties that 

953
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,940
have really good management and you 
know,

954
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:42,774
that,
you know,

955
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,520
you're shooting,
you know,

956
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,190
a certain age limit,
you're kind of calling out,

957
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,503
you know,
the older animals maybe that aren't 

958
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:51,540
breeding anymore.
Um,

959
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:52,830
so yeah,
there's,

960
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,743
there,
there's continual differences of what 

961
00:44:55,771 --> 00:45:00,480
people feel like they want to accept.
Some people want to be able to.

962
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,060
Some people just like hunting,
like nugent.

963
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,010
He just loves hunting his ranch.
Right?

964
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,830
I mean he unsat thing.

965
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,190
I think he also has,
he's has a problem moving around.

966
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:12,024
Well he doesn't mean he can't really go 
elk hunting like where it goes hiking 

967
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,780
into the mountains eight,
10 hours a day.

968
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,870
He can't legitimately loves hunting 
Texas ranches.

969
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:26,100
Like he legitimately tree stands.
I mean I think he's limited to that.

970
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,710
Like he has two bad knees,
like really bad,

971
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,780
like [inaudible].
He's got artificial knees.

972
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,740
He said some serious surgeries.
We've got friends that loved to hunt.

973
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,830
I'm like exotic ranches.
Yeah.

974
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,490
Well I can see.
I could see the argument both ways.

975
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,713
Like if you're a meat eater and you want
to get meat from a free range cattle 

976
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:52,320
ranch,
you know you only want grass fed,

977
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:57,510
grass finished beef free range that 
roams around.

978
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,040
Like there's a lot of people that feel 
that way.

979
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,300
Yep.
Well,

980
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,130
what is why you're hunting?
Are you hunting because you,

981
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,250
you want meat?

982
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,210
Are you hunting because you want to kill
your on meat?

983
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,380
Are you hunting because you want to eat 
wild game or you're hunting because it's

984
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:14,380
fun or you're hunting for all the 
reasons all the above and if it's,

985
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,273
if it's an all of the above,
some people feel like the only kind of 

986
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:22,830
hunting they want to do is backpacking.
Public land.

987
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,703
Yep.
Go into the wilderness and they don't 

988
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:30,420
want to have anything to do with raising
those animals,

989
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:31,254
helping those animals.
They want those animals be straight up 

990
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:35,880
wild,
you know,

991
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:38,730
and they feel like that is the most 
ethical way.

992
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,090
There's a lot of weird debates about 
public land to.

993
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,133
Here's one that really gets me is a lot 
of people that are really into public 

994
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:48,840
land and public land is super important 
to them.

995
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:50,730
They want,
they only want to hunt public land,

996
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,110
but they have secret spots on public 
land.

997
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,260
They don't want anybody to know about 
them and if you tell someone about their

998
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:00,300
spot on public land,
they'll get mad at you.

999
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:01,823
Like if you take someone to a spot,
I've heard Rinella talk about this on 

1000
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:07,210
the show,
like he's the big public land guy,

1001
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:12,650
but he'll talk on his show about what a 
betrayal it is.

1002
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,573
If you tell a person about a spot and 
they tell someone else about that spot 

1003
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,760
or they go to that spot without you 
like,

1004
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,980
what the fuck are you talking about?
Is this public land or is it not?

1005
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,740
And if it's not,
if it is public land,

1006
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,933
if you're telling someone about a spot,
you're telling me that this public land 

1007
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:34,120
spot you don't want them going to 
without you.

1008
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,590
Not unless they find it on their own.
Dad Is fucking ridiculous.

1009
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,090
Right?
That's ridiculous.

1010
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,910
That's like spot.

1011
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,293
You have a private spot on public land,
so you're a public land guy until it 

1012
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:48,814
infringes on your own privacy,
like you figured out a way to have a 

1013
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:54,634
private spot on public land and if you 
share this private spot with someone 

1014
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:58,984
else,
they're not allowed to go there without 

1015
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:01,210
you.
Fuck you.

1016
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,080
That's crazy dude.
That's the number one rule in fishing to

1017
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,070
someone takes or it's not.
Yeah,

1018
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:07,923
but if someone takes you to a sweet 
little spot where they just rip lips 

1019
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:11,404
constantly on,
on a lake and then next thing you know 

1020
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:16,030
they go out there on the weekend and 
you're sitting there in your boat with a

1021
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:21,031
bunch of buddies that stupid.
This is going to get mad and be like,

1022
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:22,990
Bro,
I took you to my spot.

1023
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,280
Well,
they're assholes.

1024
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,290
Stupid.
I don't think so.

1025
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,740
You think they should not go there?
I think there's.

1026
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,090
Do you think they own that spot?
It's fucking child.

1027
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,060
They don't own it.
They don't own it.

1028
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,790
Let's,
let's talk about like lake superior.

1029
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,673
Okay.
We got a giant ass lake and someone has 

1030
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:42,100
a spot where all the lake trout live.
A little reef.

1031
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:42,943
Yeah,
where everything's chill and tell me 

1032
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:45,274
about that spot and then you go back 
there six months later and I'm at that 

1033
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,330
spot.
You're going to be mad at me.

1034
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,190
No,
probably not.

1035
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,053
Not Me,
but what if it's a guy that you don't 

1036
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:54,700
know as well?
If I went back and you had a whole bunch

1037
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:55,540
of guys there,
it'd be like,

1038
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:59,110
dude should have saved this spot for 
this ridiculous.

1039
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,183
It's a fucking public lane.
Not taking you in any of my spa did not 

1040
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,990
see.
This is the thing,

1041
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,013
this,
these people that say they want 

1042
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:08,440
everything to be public.

1043
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,990
That's not public.
It's not public.

1044
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:12,970
If you don't want other people going 
back there.

1045
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:13,804
I see the argument though,
because he put in the work to find a 

1046
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:17,044
good place that took work within public 
land and you better not tell people 

1047
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:21,850
about it or they're going to go back.
Yeah,

1048
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:24,100
that's will.
That's where you go wrong.

1049
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,540
Yeah.
If you find it,

1050
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:28,360
you gotta just you gotta just keep it 
quiet.

1051
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,330
That's so corny.
That's so ridiculous.

1052
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,480
Like,
do you want that spot to yourself?

1053
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,640
You want that spot to be private in a 
way.

1054
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:37,474
Yeah,
you do.

1055
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:41,020
You're making a private area and public 
land.

1056
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,770
That's what you're doing.
Yep.

1057
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,600
I think that's preposterous.
Well,

1058
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,540
could you imagine if you say you were 
going to cotton,

1059
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,423
you left camp an hour and a half before 
daylight and you pack all the way out 

1060
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:55,300
there and there's someone sitting on 
your glass and rock in that basin.

1061
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,450
It's not yours,
but you would still say,

1062
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,030
I should've never told this guy that was
here.

1063
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,500
All right.
Someone got there first.

1064
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,400
No one's ever tell you about their 
spouses spot.

1065
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,620
That's been the same way for hundreds of
thousands a year.

1066
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,483
It has way it has,
but someone found it put in the work to 

1067
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:18,520
find it.
This is small minded thinking,

1068
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:20,890
man,
this is small minded thinking.

1069
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,600
I know.
Sorry,

1070
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:27,070
but this is a common way of thinking.
I would say.

1071
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,510
I'd say there's people that don't think 
that way,

1072
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:30,344
but there are certainly people that are.
I would have to side with with grinnell 

1073
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:34,850
on that.
Really?

1074
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,560
Yeah.
So you think.

1075
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:38,930
So let me ask you this.
So if you,

1076
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:39,764
if someone takes you to a place and it's
this really good meal deer spot and you 

1077
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:44,474
gotta you hike in seven miles and this 
is beautiful base in and you go there 

1078
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:52,220
and just just to always deer there,
you don't go there without that person's

1079
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:53,240
permission would tell.

1080
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,010
I would say,
are you going to be there?

1081
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,140
And if he said no and I'd say,
can I go,

1082
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,200
I wouldn't take that would be carried on
national forest land.

1083
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,410
Can I go to public land?
Can I go to this spot?

1084
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,283
You don't fucking own even a little bit 
out of respect for that guy that found 

1085
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:11,540
it,
found it.

1086
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,250
Yeah.
Just walked.

1087
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,490
He walked on the dirt,
found what?

1088
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,370
A tree.
Those are more true.

1089
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,080
This is crazy.
Martin rocked.

1090
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:25,160
I stand on this top to cliff is cliff.
That's crazy.

1091
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:26,780
Yeah,
I mean you can take it to a point,

1092
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,530
but craze I still think it's code is a 
weird code.

1093
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,830
The other argument though too,
is just from a hunting situation,

1094
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,520
Jamie is a person who doesn't hunt it 
all.

1095
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:36,901
I mean,
I,

1096
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:40,010
I've heard it so I understand like it's 
not a new concept to me,

1097
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:41,600
but I'm trying to compare it to 
something else.

1098
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,433
Like if it was a pickup basketball hoop,
I found somewhere not built until 

1099
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:46,004
somebody to go to that playground 
because it's my hoop and I show up at 

1100
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,830
people or they're playing a public 
playground.

1101
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,170
Fine.
Another hoop to play on.

1102
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,700
Well,
you don't play basketball.

1103
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:57,090
That seems ridiculous,
but I'm just trying to think that you,

1104
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:57,924
like you have a specialty in today's Day
and age because today people use like 

1105
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,940
onyx maps and they use google earth and 
you could find these beautiful spots and

1106
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:10,304
you just go out to them.
Like if you find a beautiful spot on 

1107
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:15,050
google earth and you go out to it and 
you go,

1108
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:15,884
hey man,
this is a spot I found don't golder to 

1109
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:22,840
merge.
But bottom public wind seems ridiculous.

1110
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:24,230
Yeah,
it does.

1111
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,510
It does.
But there,

1112
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:29,240
I think there's a legitimate code to it.
It seems ridiculous,

1113
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:34,190
but it seems understandable that someone
will be upset if they're looking forward

1114
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:35,024
to going to a place and they told you 
about it a year ago and they go to that 

1115
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:38,570
place.

1116
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,403
They hike him,
takes him nine miles when you were 

1117
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:42,260
there.
Yeah.

1118
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,280
Tough Shit.
Go.

1119
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:47,920
Another nine should have got there 
earlier.

1120
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:48,763
You procrastinate and Motherfucker,
I'm taking you with me when we're going 

1121
00:52:53,521 --> 00:52:55,310
into someone's spot.
I'll let you.

1122
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,070
No one owns any spots.
See,

1123
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,780
that's what's so weird about it.
To me.

1124
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,480
It's,
it's there.

1125
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,100
There definitely is.
There definitely is a line.

1126
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,993
I mean,
I see your argument 100 percent and I 

1127
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,320
know it,
you know,

1128
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,400
at some point it,
it,

1129
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,110
it could definitely get childish or out 
of hand.

1130
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:14,600
I mean obviously there's a ton of a ton 
of stuff,

1131
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,430
but out of courtesy.
Yeah.

1132
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:18,710
I mean if anytime you showed me 
something cool,

1133
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:19,221
if you're like,
hey,

1134
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:21,750
I got this cool thing is what I do,
you know,

1135
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,460
it's kind of private.
Take my family there,

1136
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,410
whatever.
I'd like.

1137
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,220
Yeah,
I respect

1138
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,900
that,
but it's not private.

1139
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,423
That's what's weird.
What's weird is the whole water's not 

1140
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,710
either public land,
but fishermen would be the same.

1141
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,170
Right?
Captain still close captains.

1142
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:37,710
It is.

1143
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:41,610
The thing about public land is that it's
supposed to be everyone's.

1144
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,403
So if you find a really good area in 
public land that's supposed to be 

1145
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:49,540
available for everyone.
Yeah.

1146
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,453
It does not.
What everybody wants what everybody 

1147
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:53,544
wants.
That's one of the things about people 

1148
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:57,330
not wanting new people to get into 
hunting.

1149
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,033
Like I've heard this argument before,
like you shouldn't be telling people to 

1150
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:02,910
get into hunting because it's already 
tough.

1151
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:03,744
A tough enough out there on public land 
has already so many people hunting on 

1152
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:08,670
public land.
If more people get into hunting,

1153
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,080
who's going to be more pressure?

1154
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,840
Like what?
And yeah,

1155
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:13,370
that's,
that's not me.

1156
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,770
I'm definitely looking to get more 
people in for sure.

1157
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,590
Right?
Because you're thinking they didn't know

1158
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:23,150
about your spots.
I'll find a new spot.

1159
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,130
That's a good attitude.
One of the,

1160
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:25,964
um,
one of the questions or I guess 

1161
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,660
arguments too is,
you know,

1162
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:30,583
I don't understand that when people,
they don't have any tolerance for like 

1163
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:37,820
hunting private land,
so to speak,

1164
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,120
or they don't have tolerance for,
you know,

1165
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:45,800
I don't mind people that hunt exotic 
ranches or hunted high fence.

1166
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:49,100
That's just not,
that's like not what I personally like,

1167
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,980
but I also understand that people do.
But I,

1168
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,130
I also don't like it when people are 
like super negative to that,

1169
00:54:55,131 --> 00:54:55,964
but yet they'll have like a bull in a 
pen or they'll have chickens in a cage 

1170
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,080
or they'll have a goat in there like 
raising and raising and go to slaughter.

1171
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:06,914
I Dunno,
is it that is because it shows us a 

1172
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:09,350
different scale.
No,

1173
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,370
but it's not because it shows that 
there's a difference.

1174
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,670
Hang in the pursuit of a wild animal.
There's a different thing to that.

1175
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,040
Like,
like here's the thing,

1176
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,060
say if you,
there's a ranch and the ranch is 5,000

1177
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:23,610
acres,
which is big but not the biggest.

1178
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,130
And on that 5,000
Acre ranch,

1179
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:31,131
someone shoots a giant buck like a huge 
two for 240 inch mule deer,

1180
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,550
epic deer and people are like wow,
but it's a private ranch and you kind of

1181
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:39,384
know that there wasn't a lot of pressure
there so they probably knew where this 

1182
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:43,404
deer was and people that worked on this 
ranch told people about this deer and 

1183
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:49,040
they kind of kept their eye on it and 
they knew where to go to find them.

1184
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:54,470
Versus you getting your truck driving 
four hours outside of Reno in Nevada,

1185
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,120
getting out into the mountains by 
yourself.

1186
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:01,303
You're like setting up camp by yourself,
spending three or four days just 

1187
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:06,840
scouting,
just earning your spot,

1188
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:10,290
finding your styles out there,
finding your spot.

1189
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:15,030
But it's more difficult as the point.
So like if someone accomplishes that,

1190
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:16,943
you look at it differently than someone 
who's shot something in a high ranch in 

1191
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:22,470
Texas,
it's just a different thing.

1192
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,010
Yeah.
But what I know

1193
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,910
what I'm saying is like hunters versus 
non hunters,

1194
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,280
people that are non hunting that really 
looked down on like what

1195
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,243
we're talking about is hires.
But yet they'll raise a goat to 

1196
00:56:35,401 --> 00:56:39,780
slaughter in attending that.
It's some sort of pursuit man versus.

1197
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,623
And See,
the thing about the hunting thing is 

1198
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,983
you're,
you're looking at it like it's a 

1199
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,593
difficult pursuit.
Like you're out there trying to outwit 

1200
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:49,740
this animal.
For me.

1201
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,420
Yeah,
that's what I like about it.

1202
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,480
But if you're in a 400 acre fenced in 
property with a bunch of exotics running

1203
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,190
around,
you're sitting in a tree stand is a pile

1204
00:56:59,191 --> 00:57:00,024
of corn down there and you're waiting 
for an animal to walk over to that 

1205
00:57:02,281 --> 00:57:07,020
corner and you whack it.
That is very different than say what you

1206
00:57:07,021 --> 00:57:11,940
did this year in Alberta when you were 
telling me that you were hiking hundreds

1207
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:12,700
of.
I mean,

1208
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,640
how,
how many days did you guys go?

1209
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,080
I think we went nine.
Did 100 miles.

1210
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,073
Yeah.
So you hiked a hundred miles in the 

1211
00:57:21,841 --> 00:57:24,090
wilderness for nine days?

1212
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,070
No elk and never got.
Never got one.

1213
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:27,160
Never got one.
Yeah.

1214
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,390
That is very different.
Right?

1215
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,110
So.
Oh yeah.

1216
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,943
That's real hunting in comparison to 
someone who's sitting over a pile of 

1217
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:37,460
corn fenced in ranch.
Yeah,

1218
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,260
that's,
that's why I think people have a problem

1219
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:41,560
with it,
the,

1220
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,673
that anybody would compare what you did 
to that and then there's like the 

1221
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:51,450
intermediary,
which is like a really nice ranch that's

1222
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:52,284
not high fence,
but it's a private ranch like the place 

1223
00:57:55,081 --> 00:57:58,680
we went to in Utah that is private.
Not everybody can go there,

1224
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:02,420
but those are just wild animals roaming 
around and uh,

1225
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,970
yeah.
And opportunities high.

1226
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,730
Yes.
More opportunity,

1227
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:08,580
but no,
nothing fenced in.

1228
00:58:08,581 --> 00:58:10,140
Nothing's keeping the animals there and 
they,

1229
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,270
those animals had been there for 
thousands of years.

1230
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,323
It's just what they do.
You just have the opportunity to hunt a 

1231
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:17,274
wild animal on a piece of property where
there's not going to be a lot of people 

1232
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:21,750
there.
Yup.

1233
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,680
Yeah,
it's my preference.

1234
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:26,843
I like doing,
I really liked the balance of having 

1235
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:33,180
really tough aunts,
especially because I knew my,

1236
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,240
you know,
my Utah Hunt wouldn't quite be the same.

1237
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,420
That was kind of a very different 
experience for me.

1238
00:58:39,421 --> 00:58:42,240
I haven't ever had an opportunity like 
that,

1239
00:58:42,241 --> 00:58:45,360
so that was quite a,
quite a difference for me.

1240
00:58:45,361 --> 00:58:48,420
Whereas I'm between the other states 
that I hunted,

1241
00:58:48,421 --> 00:58:49,254
I think I did.
I think I was right at just over 200 

1242
00:58:52,351 --> 00:58:54,420
miles before,
uh,

1243
00:58:54,421 --> 00:58:56,920
before we got our first bull,
you know,

1244
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,460
between there and then hunting some,
uh,

1245
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:00,953
some private land,
but also some public land in Montana 

1246
00:59:02,881 --> 00:59:03,714
before finally getting that first elk.
Can you talk about what happened with 

1247
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:08,490
Montana?
With the bear?

1248
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,290
Um,
yeah.

1249
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,850
I mean,
I can talk about it.

1250
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:16,170
They actually text me back and ruled 
back that it was not a grizzly.

1251
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,400
What's.
Yeah,

1252
00:59:17,401 --> 00:59:21,030
they say it's A.
I'm a colored black bear.

1253
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,940
Do you think that's true?
Um,

1254
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,440
yeah,
it's possible.

1255
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:27,770
I was going to pull up the pictures.
It's a black bear.

1256
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

1257
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,410
It thought it was a grizzly.
Yup.

1258
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,241
Yup.
We shot,

1259
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:33,500
uh,
actually,

1260
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:34,334
um,
our,

1261
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,300
our mutual friend Andy Stumpf,
Shahada Bull on nine slash 11,

1262
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,430
which was,
which was pretty,

1263
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,443
um,
pretty cool for him to have an 

1264
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:44,650
experience like that.
And it took us,

1265
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:46,910
um,
I forget how far out we were,

1266
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,140
just several,
several miles from camp and we,

1267
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:54,380
it took us two trips to pack this bull 
out.

1268
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:55,820
And,
uh,

1269
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:59,810
the first pack out that we did,
I think we finally got back to camp,

1270
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,610
I don't know,
somewhere around midnight or something.

1271
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:04,270
So the next morning we went back at 
firstlight,

1272
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,790
took us a while to pack back in there.
And when we got there,

1273
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:09,920
um,
half of the carcass,

1274
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,290
I had already pulled everything apart.

1275
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,230
We had everything gained bags,
everything was strung up in trees,

1276
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:16,963
but the actual cavity was half buried.
And as we were approaching I seen 

1277
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:25,730
something kind of running off.
And by the coloration on the side,

1278
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:28,520
I really thought for sure it was a gris,
um,

1279
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:32,420
because I've seen lots of them and we 
got up there and sure enough it was,

1280
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,373
it was buried.
So we kind of took a lot of precaution 

1281
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:38,720
as we were trying to tell people just to
explain to people what that means.

1282
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,790
So it Grizzly,
um,

1283
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:44,570
they will bury something that they find 
and they,

1284
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:49,010
I think they do it for a couple reasons.
One of the reasons is they want,

1285
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:49,873
they don't want like prey birds like 
crows and stuff to be able to see it 

1286
01:00:53,871 --> 01:00:54,704
because they'll start talking.
And then other predators in the area 

1287
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:59,000
listen for those birds and then,
you know,

1288
01:00:59,001 --> 01:01:02,150
it's kind of a magnet starts to draw,
so they like to conceal it.

1289
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,043
So the literally kind of pivot on a 
circle around that kill and actually 

1290
01:01:07,671 --> 01:01:12,410
claw the ground in and bury them.
And it's like,

1291
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:16,100
I've seen a were grizzlies barrier full 
moose and it's,

1292
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,020
it is ridiculous.
The type of dirt they can move,

1293
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:21,883
I'm talking,
it looks like a skid loader came in 

1294
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:26,150
there and buried these things and they 
can do,

1295
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,850
they can do that kind of work fairly 
quick.

1296
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,880
Um,
but they'll pile up everything around it

1297
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,773
and then they kind of normally we'll 
create one small little hole at the end 

1298
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:37,423
of that mound where they'll kinda crawl 
in there and they literally like eat 

1299
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,000
from one side to the other side,
you know.

1300
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,600
And uh,
and it's normally the back end first.

1301
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,010
Um,
so yeah,

1302
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,293
I felt like we had just got there when 
this bear had just discovered the 

1303
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:58,994
carcass and had just started the burial 
process because he hadn't pulled 

1304
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:05,030
anything out of the trees.

1305
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:07,700
He had only started to cover the 
carcass,

1306
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:09,890
which normally they'll cover that seal 
first,

1307
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,053
then they'll clean up the scraps around 
and then they go to their pile and kind 

1308
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:16,550
of consume that last.
Um,

1309
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:21,450
but I was certain that we had seen one.
We ended up seeing a wildlife biologist,

1310
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,950
uh,
later on.

1311
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,210
And I told him I thought I saw a grid 
and he told me,

1312
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:28,044
he said,
well,

1313
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,173
it's pretty important if you did,
because there hasn't been one naturally 

1314
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:36,960
on this hill and I think he said a 
hundred years.

1315
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,940
So he's like,
you know,

1316
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:41,940
would you be willing to go back in there
to put a camera up,

1317
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:44,890
which is not smart.
If it was a,

1318
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:46,410
if it was a Grizzly,
it's,

1319
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:47,483
I mean,
obviously they're gonna be depending on 

1320
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:52,110
their demeanor.
They can be very protective of that.

1321
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,453
Um,
but we did end up going back in there 

1322
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,090
just to put the camera up.

1323
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:59,580
And then after the camera was there a 
few weeks,

1324
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,540
he sent a picture and said,
you were close to being right.

1325
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:08,930
It's just a perfectly colored,
a black bear that looks like,

1326
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,150
like it would be a grizzly,
but how does he know for sure?

1327
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,820
You can tell by they don't have,
um,

1328
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,820
you thought it was a grizzly when you 
saw the photo?

1329
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,790
Yeah.
They,

1330
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,030
they don't have a very.
I thought it was a younger one,

1331
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,000
but they don't have a very distinct,
um,

1332
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,620
hump on their back.
And then the claw marks.

1333
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,340
See he went in.
You can tell a lot by the clause.

1334
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:31,200
So when you go in and you look at the 
tracks,

1335
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:33,450
that's also a really easy way because 
like,

1336
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:37,050
like that beer that was a wrestling 
Khabib,

1337
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,300
uh,
you could see the claws,

1338
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:43,380
like grizzlies have very,
very distinct a clause.

1339
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,363
So that was a just looking here.
So I can't really pull up the pick for 

1340
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:52,750
every sentence.
Jamie,

1341
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:54,123
let me check it out.

1342
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,040
Yeah,
I could see that.

1343
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:02,290
That's Luke and that doesn't actually 
kind of looked like a brown bear.

1344
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:04,200
And now that I look at black bear 
rather.

1345
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,720
Yeah.
And then running the head is going to be

1346
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:07,554
narrower and it took several pictures.
Some of the pictures that looked more 

1347
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:14,880
like a grid just because the coloration,
some of the pictures that didn't,

1348
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,360
so,
um,

1349
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,910
you know,
and keep in mind,

1350
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,793
you know,
Mountain Grizzlies look a little bit 

1351
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:23,370
different than like a coastal bear or 
inland grizzly,

1352
01:04:23,371 --> 01:04:24,204
but either way it was,
it was a bear that came in and covered 

1353
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:30,530
the whole carcass and went to eat it.
Now,

1354
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,373
when you were in Alberta,
you went back to that place that you 

1355
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,690
were talking about on the first podcast 
we ever did,

1356
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,673
where you had that encounter,
where you shot that elk that was just 

1357
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:40,980
outside of that wolf den.

1358
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,940
Yeah.
Wolves tried to claim the elk.

1359
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:48,080
You guys how to shoot your way out of 
there is a fucking crazy story.

1360
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:52,470
What was it like to be back there again?
It was,

1361
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:55,500
what was strange about it is while we 
were there,

1362
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,133
uh,
I actually found that they were back in 

1363
01:05:00,571 --> 01:05:01,820
that area.
Um,

1364
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:07,140
there was some fresh tracks and then we 
heard one how like during that thing.

1365
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:07,974
So it was almost like,
it was a little bit weird because I'm 

1366
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,750
just,
you guys bring extra bullets as time.

1367
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,740
We only had my bow this time.
I'm sending you this Jamie.

1368
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:17,663
Oh Jesus.
Um,

1369
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,420
but uh,
yeah,

1370
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:21,580
the,
the thing that I'm,

1371
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:26,110
the thing that was always kind of 
creeped me out a little bit was just,

1372
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:27,723
it was,
I felt like I had like a kind of a 

1373
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:30,964
personal connection with that Alpha male
because the way he came in at the very 

1374
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:40,591
end because he wanted to know what the 
heck had taken out three of his pack.

1375
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,001
He wanted,
like,

1376
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:45,580
it's almost like he's like,
I know we're getting out of here,

1377
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:47,740
but I want to see this for myself 
because,

1378
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,650
you know,
they were close enough but I don't think

1379
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:55,060
they could totally see us.
So is that was going away.

1380
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,930
Um,
grizzly.

1381
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:58,883
Yeah.
It doesn't look like a brown or a black 

1382
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:01,000
bear though.
In the nose.

1383
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:03,250
Yep.
See how the face is more narrow.

1384
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,950
So yeah.
And then the cost to.

1385
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:07,000
Yup.
Yup.

1386
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,321
Yeah.
Which,

1387
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:12,280
like on the right foot,
the claw looks more like a black bear on

1388
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:13,114
the left foot.
There was some grass there that made it 

1389
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,580
a little bit strange.
But um,

1390
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:22,900
when that Alpha male came in to kind of,
you know,

1391
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:24,400
I think he just wanted to know,
okay,

1392
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,250
what's caused all this stuff?
So,

1393
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:28,960
you know,
I looked at,

1394
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:29,794
I looked him in the face and just pretty
much said I'm going to shoot you in the 

1395
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:32,794
face.

1396
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,630
Um,
I always,

1397
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,760
every time I go back in that area,
I'm like,

1398
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:38,740
you know,
this old suckers walking around,

1399
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:43,770
he knows my smell is going to be like 
there's the members personally.

1400
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,033
They are smart.
I could picture him remembering it and 

1401
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:49,430
saying,
oh,

1402
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,710
okay,
this,

1403
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:52,070
oh this,
oh,

1404
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:55,280
this dude can make him into a hero 
turret.

1405
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,120
On the side of that,
I sent you that,

1406
01:06:58,121 --> 01:06:58,954
uh,
that Wolf Big Wolf Shit that had 

1407
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:02,640
porcupine quills,
all of that.

1408
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,483
I put that on instagram.
It's funny how many people were like 

1409
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,050
that.
That is not porcupine quills.

1410
01:07:08,051 --> 01:07:09,370
It's like,
listen people,

1411
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:13,060
I'm in the outdoors 200 days,
probably a year.

1412
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:15,720
And if there's porcupine quills coming 
out,

1413
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:18,280
pile of Shit,
I'm pretty sure I know what it is.

1414
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,690
It's hard to tell from a photo on my 
instagram.

1415
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:23,913
Here we go.
It's a pile of shit with porcupine 

1416
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:29,104
quills in it.

1417
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:32,890
Imagine how God damn hungry.
You have to be to be eating porcupine.

1418
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,250
Quills wolf's that tough.
He doesn't care.

1419
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:38,930
It's like a bear.
Look at how many bears just.

1420
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:43,970
We'll just go head first into a pile and
like a fire ant bed or a wasps' nests.

1421
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,860
Like yellow jacket is.
Make that a little bigger please.

1422
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:51,850
Down in the bottom you can see some nice
quills yeah,

1423
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,250
yeah.
Some people will go to her.

1424
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:57,340
The other is there is porcupine hair in 
their.

1425
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:59,350
Correct.
Those are all so close.

1426
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,293
There's,
there's a couple of little blood drops 

1427
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:03,740
up there.
Need some prep age.

1428
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,940
Um,
yeah,

1429
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:08,380
they're,
they're beasts there.

1430
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:09,490
Beast.
That is,

1431
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:12,520
I think,
I think their intelligence,

1432
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,850
their intelligence level is super high.
I think a lot of,

1433
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,093
you know,
the more you're in the outdoors and you 

1434
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:23,210
experience things demeanors and their,
uh,

1435
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,740
their ability to survive.

1436
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,431
You know,
you look at,

1437
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:26,390
uh,
one of the,

1438
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:30,560
you look at an old grizzly that's been 
in those woods for 20 years,

1439
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:35,980
think of the experience level that thing
has surviving every single day.

1440
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,553
I mean,
every day just maybe making a slight 

1441
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:42,590
mistake,
slipping up a little bit,

1442
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,900
almost getting jacked by another 
grizzly.

1443
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:45,770
And then you're like,
oh,

1444
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,780
Yep,
I know not to do this.

1445
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:48,614
I know not to do that.
I mean they're there until their 

1446
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:51,224
intelligence level and their ability to 
function is extremely high and wolves 

1447
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:56,024
are,
I mean arguably will probably get shot 

1448
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,790
less than probably any of the other 
animals.

1449
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:02,850
I mean,
they're in.

1450
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:06,500
They are incredibly smart.
So yeah,

1451
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:07,850
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't doubt it,

1452
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,930
you know,
it was,

1453
01:09:08,931 --> 01:09:10,590
I'm in there,
they,

1454
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,513
they were very after that,
they were very intent in that area for 

1455
01:09:17,121 --> 01:09:20,360
people to put up some pretty big 
bounties on the wolves.

1456
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,583
And they really went after him and,
and knock those herds down quite a bit 

1457
01:09:24,591 --> 01:09:29,540
because there was very few mule deer,
like very few mule deer.

1458
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,100
You'd hardly see a doe.
And,

1459
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:36,310
and they had to cut the number of tags 
way down a elk as soon as wolves.

1460
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:39,470
Like how at night if a pack moves into 
an area and they,

1461
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:43,010
how like calling elk is just 
nonexistent.

1462
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,340
They just,
everything's just like don't say nothing

1463
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:48,020
because you know,
they're here.

1464
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,610
Um,
so yeah,

1465
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:51,980
I think I think them thinning them down 
was,

1466
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,730
was very relevant.
And since then,

1467
01:09:55,731 --> 01:09:58,150
which was quite awhile ago,
um,

1468
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:59,143
the numbers of like elk and Moose,
I like this past year I saw way more 

1469
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:04,570
moose than I've seen.
Um,

1470
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,830
I think they're really hard on moose 
fonds.

1471
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,980
Um,
and yeah,

1472
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:14,720
I mean Moose Mulally's white tails.
I saw way more animals this year,

1473
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:17,030
uh,
than in the past up there.

1474
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:17,863
And I think it's just because that Moose
number or the wolf number was just much 

1475
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:23,660
lower.
But there was,

1476
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:26,510
like I said,
there was still sign that there was some

1477
01:10:26,511 --> 01:10:27,860
in the area,
just nothing.

1478
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:31,220
Like several years ago when I was there,
it was,

1479
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,440
you know,
it was even,

1480
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:34,274
I would say,
as much as I appreciate balance in 

1481
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:36,854
nature,
it was excessive and it's getting that 

1482
01:10:40,161 --> 01:10:42,320
way now.
Like even in Wisconsin,

1483
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,243
I remember I was talking to a friend of 
mine up in an area I used to live up by 

1484
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:47,983
kind of in the Lacrosse area,
actually lived a little northeast of 

1485
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,220
Lacrosse by a small town called 
cataract.

1486
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:58,010
And there was a few times where there 
were some wolf spottings.

1487
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:58,903
Um,
there's a big military base called Fort 

1488
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:03,830
Mccoy and I lived up on the northern 
side of the base,

1489
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:05,690
um,
what was called the impact area.

1490
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:10,730
They kind of shot test rounds over and 
they kind of went off there or whatever,

1491
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:14,340
but there was an incredible number of 
like deer

1492
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,050
and things that were in there.
So,

1493
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,073
you know,
kind of the rumor was that they had 

1494
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:21,780
introduced wolves into their timber 
wolves to let,

1495
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,350
to Kinda thinned down some of those 
numbers will now it's to the point where

1496
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:26,184
the amount of people I know in Wisconsin
that sea wolves is just rapidly 

1497
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:31,710
increasing.
And obviously when that happens,

1498
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,870
you know,
they eat stuff.

1499
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,030
I mean,
wolves don't mess around.

1500
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:39,330
They take stuff down and sometimes it's 
just strange.

1501
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:41,770
You don't understand the balance of,
um,

1502
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:45,720
of why there's an introduction to 
something that you know,

1503
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:49,380
has the possibility to just take over,
you know,

1504
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:50,520
it's,
it's strange.

1505
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,481
Well,
it is,

1506
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:53,940
but it's also,
there needs to be some sort of balance.

1507
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:58,770
You don't want the animals 
overpopulating and you do want some sort

1508
01:11:58,771 --> 01:12:03,771
of a balance between Predator and prey.
But the real problem becomes when people

1509
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:06,680
don't want to manage the predators,
right?

1510
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:10,530
They only want,
they want nature to sort itself out.

1511
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:13,260
Yeah.
It doesn't really work that way though.

1512
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:14,143
Yeah.
I mean it's just people need to 

1513
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:18,720
understand like if you do like deer and 
Moose and you,

1514
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:22,770
like all these other animals,
you can't have too many wolves.

1515
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,223
Too many.
Yeah.

1516
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,970
You can't have too many grizzlies 
because if you do,

1517
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:29,220
you're going to have very few of those 
other animals.

1518
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:31,050
You're not gonna see them,
they're going to get wiped out.

1519
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,770
And in some places like they're almost 
at the point of extinction.

1520
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:35,604
Like what,
what does that Caribou herd that's in 

1521
01:12:37,951 --> 01:12:40,890
North America?
Caribou herd.

1522
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,753
Yeah.
I'm not that familiar with it because 

1523
01:12:42,661 --> 01:12:44,610
I've never really been a,
um,

1524
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,160
a Caribou person,
you know,

1525
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,053
from a hunting aspect,
but they're an animal that's like 

1526
01:12:49,851 --> 01:12:51,990
severely targeted by wolves.
You.

1527
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:52,950
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1528
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:53,784
I could see it.
Anything with a very predictable 

1529
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:58,770
migration is going to be very prone to,
you know,

1530
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,230
to any type of prey creature you look 
at,

1531
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,573
you look at any of the migrations of 
like willdabeast and stuff like that in 

1532
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:07,470
Africa where they're having to migrate.

1533
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,350
Those crocs are just like,
oh yeah,

1534
01:13:10,351 --> 01:13:12,600
here we go.
We know where that river crossing is.

1535
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:15,720
We know where the neck down.
It's the same thing.

1536
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:16,770
It's terrible.
You know,

1537
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:17,700
I mean,
I'm sure you knew this,

1538
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:18,534
but many people don't.
The females actually have antlers and 

1539
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:22,920
the reason why they have antlers is to 
fend off wolves.

1540
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,320
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

1541
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:26,154
Female Caribou have antlers.
And one of the only deer species where 

1542
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:30,340
the females have antlers.
Yeah.

1543
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,330
I didn't know he made sure that's true.
I don't think.

1544
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,201
Well,
I mean,

1545
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:37,530
I guess I guess if it's for wolves,
but they all have antlers,

1546
01:13:37,531 --> 01:13:38,940
right?
Fall Caribou,

1547
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:40,080
have antlers.
Well,

1548
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:42,150
you're male and flushing it.
I didn't think so,

1549
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:46,520
but I think they do.
How good was a.

1550
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:51,470
How good was that elk from that camp.
Oh,

1551
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,130
fantastic.
Is that true?

1552
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,960
I'm right.
You're usually right.

1553
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:58,830
People would disagree.

1554
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:03,120
I'd say eight times this.
A few times where I say things though,

1555
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:04,740
when I go,
who the fuck are you saying?

1556
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:08,430
You know what you're saying?
At least you a question.

1557
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:09,860
Yeah.
You questioned it always,

1558
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,880
and you laugh about it.
Now I'm no expert.

1559
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,920
I'm an expert in very,
very few things.

1560
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,190
But uh,
I think you have very,

1561
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:20,260
uh,
your intelligence levels high.

1562
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,480
It just says that males are,
tend to be a little bit bigger.

1563
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:24,490
Antlers are a little bit bigger,
but yeah,

1564
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:25,324
they both have.
Um,

1565
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,211
yeah.
Well,

1566
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:27,044
um,
see if it's true that the females have 

1567
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:30,640
it defend off wolves.
I think that's theoretical actually.

1568
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,830
Anyway,
that's the part that,

1569
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:34,720
that's the part where I was like,
well,

1570
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:35,853
I'm pretty sure I saw that in a 
documentary that the females have it to 

1571
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:43,480
fend off wolves.
That was speculation.

1572
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,433
Speculation.
Three 60 video of what a cool animal 

1573
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:47,650
man.

1574
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,500
They're so cool looking.
I've never hunted them.

1575
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:51,783
I would like to.
They're supposed to be delicious and 

1576
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:54,604
there's a shitload of them.
Like that's the crazy thing about 

1577
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,410
Alaska.
The areas of Alaska,

1578
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:03,100
like they'll have hundreds and hundreds 
of them and these streams,

1579
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,550
you know more than that depending on the
migration.

1580
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,473
Yeah,
sure.

1581
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,760
But I'm not streamed,
you know,

1582
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:11,830
whatever path full of them.
There's one with no antlers.

1583
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:15,300
Must have lost them.
Do they lose their antlers to them?

1584
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,660
Have them.
It says there are exceptions.

1585
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:21,490
Like there's this one dude got jacked,
but you see elk like that.

1586
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:26,020
Yeah.
We see that I'm years had a broken time.

1587
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,360
Didn't a little one.
Yeah.

1588
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,980
Not,
not a big broken one,

1589
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:33,130
but we saw one that I almost shot that 
it only had one antler.

1590
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,153
Yeah,
you'd like that were with me and you 

1591
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,850
shut that one white tail.
I'm like,

1592
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:39,400
he's broken on one side you're like,
I want a gangster.

1593
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,700
They're going down.
It doesn't bother me.

1594
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,820
It the antlers to me,
a secondary.

1595
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,500
Number one,
I want the meat and I want.

1596
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,620
I'm a mature animal,
but to.

1597
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:53,230
It doesn't bother me.
If there are things snapped off,

1598
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,020
it means they're just going to war.
I was,

1599
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:57,103
I was really pumped for that camp 
specifically because I had several good 

1600
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:03,770
friends there and I really,
you know,

1601
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:06,410
I'm just geeking out right now about 
cooking,

1602
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,380
you know,
I mean cooking stuff,

1603
01:16:09,381 --> 01:16:11,030
doing stuff different.
Um,

1604
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,310
that neck that you made.
Exactly.

1605
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,030
Oh my God.
I have to figure out.

1606
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,670
You got to give me that recipe and I got
to figure out how to do that.

1607
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,290
That was sensational,
man.

1608
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:20,310
That was so good.

1609
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,430
Grossed.
Yeah.

1610
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:24,200
We had 51.
People will,

1611
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:27,470
there's a lot of camera people there.
There was guides,

1612
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:30,710
there was,
I think people that maybe worked there.

1613
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,630
But yeah,
I made a,

1614
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,533
a massive.
I took the one half of the elk neck and 

1615
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,373
did a forward seer.
So we've talked about reverse sear that 

1616
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:44,510
our buddy Chad ward taught us.
Um,

1617
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,250
but this was a,
I call it affords here.

1618
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:47,840
Maybe I'm wrong,
but it's just a car.

1619
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,580
Yeah.
So I see her at the beginning,

1620
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,313
uh,
in a big cast iron pot way to massive 

1621
01:16:53,031 --> 01:16:55,730
cast iron pot barely didn't even fit in 
the trigger.

1622
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:56,923
Um,
and so we seared that whole neck and 

1623
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:03,250
then season it really well I season it 
with like a,

1624
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,313
a trigger prime rib rub and then a 
coffee rub and then I put some of the 

1625
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:13,940
rifle and knocked and loaded coffee in 
there and then put in.

1626
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:18,380
I think about it,
it was the pot was so massive,

1627
01:17:18,381 --> 01:17:19,214
but I put in about six cups of bone 
broth and then covered it with a cast 

1628
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:25,784
iron lid,
a wrapped it all up in foil and then 

1629
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:28,934
cooked it at 2:25
I think for about 18 hours because of 

1630
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:33,074
how big it was.
And then we knew it was about ready to 

1631
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:36,974
be done.
So we grilled some peppers and think is 

1632
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,063
that all we put in their grilled a bunch
of peppers and stuff was like bell 

1633
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:46,940
peppers,
Bell Peppers,

1634
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:49,130
and I'm normally I'd do some Jalapenos 
too.

1635
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,560
We didn't have any.
And then onions in there too,

1636
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:52,430
I feel like.
Yeah,

1637
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:53,950
maybe some carrots or something in there
too.

1638
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,550
Well there was,
there was onions.

1639
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:59,330
We did grill some onions.
I'm kind of until they become allies,

1640
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:00,164
but then open that up and more or less 
just took two forks and it just fell 

1641
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:04,364
apart.

1642
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:06,920
I mean just fell apart and kind of did 
it all.

1643
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:10,130
It looked like a looked like a pulled 
pork butt is what it looked like.

1644
01:18:10,131 --> 01:18:12,140
And then we went ahead and put in all 
the,

1645
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:17,620
the grilled peppers and stuff in there,
put a little bit of sauce in there,

1646
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:19,634
some Texas spicy and a little bit of 
Saracha covered it back up and just let 

1647
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:25,064
it.
We actually took it out and set it in 

1648
01:18:26,241 --> 01:18:27,074
the Yeti and then let it just kind of 
sit in that Yeti for about what we went 

1649
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,310
out on the evening hunt and then we came
back,

1650
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:37,400
um,
and then we ate it for dinner so it just

1651
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:38,234
sat in that Yeti and just kinda maintain
temperature and just let all the juices 

1652
01:18:42,981 --> 01:18:43,814
and everything re redistribute back 
through that shredded meat after we 

1653
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:50,180
shredded it.
And then people just went crazy.

1654
01:18:50,181 --> 01:18:52,010
The amount of people that were coming up
to me saying,

1655
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,600
what was that?
And I'm like,

1656
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:56,390
neck.
And they couldn't believe it.

1657
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,313
They couldn't believe that a giant bowl 
with this neck that practically doubled 

1658
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:04,340
knives trying to cut through was just 
that awesome,

1659
01:19:04,341 --> 01:19:05,174
but it really is like low and slow is 
the name of the game on some of that 

1660
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:11,084
stuff and

1661
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:15,680
well the those traeger grills,
any sort of pellet grill is such a great

1662
01:19:15,681 --> 01:19:16,514
way to cook something like that too 
because you can maintain the exact 

1663
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:22,840
temperature for long periods of time.
And the thing about,

1664
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:24,470
if you've never used a pellet grill 
folks,

1665
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:27,890
they use these pellets that are made out
of wood.

1666
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,110
So like this table,
if you're going to make this table,

1667
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,213
they would use a saw to make the table 
and they would take the actual sawdust 

1668
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:34,933
and compress it and the natural sugars 
in the would make this a compressed 

1669
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,330
pellet so they don't add any chemicals 
or anything.

1670
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:42,164
It's just wood.
And then they have this element that 

1671
01:19:45,411 --> 01:19:46,244
heats it up and then they have this 
little worm drive that feeds pellets 

1672
01:19:49,311 --> 01:19:53,460
down into the heated up areas.
So the heated up area turns into the.

1673
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:54,440
I look at that,
Bam,

1674
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:59,410
the heated up area turns into fire and 
you,

1675
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,253
you got this little fire going on in 
this hopper with this hopper feeds down 

1676
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:05,060
into this cup rather.

1677
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:08,250
So the fires in the competent keeps 
pellets in there,

1678
01:20:08,251 --> 01:20:09,084
so it's a natural fire,
it's just fire in wood and it gives us 

1679
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:14,640
great flavor to the food that you're 
cooking.

1680
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:16,320
Whatever we cook and vegetables or 
anything,

1681
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:21,321
you're cooking meat and in those things 
maintain temperature so well,

1682
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:27,050
so you could keep it on a 190 degrees 
and just keep it at one 94 a fucking day

1683
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:32,550
and they're so efficient that you never 
have to add pellets.

1684
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:35,130
A,
you could do the entire 16,

1685
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:35,964
18 hours.
Where the cooking just on one hopper 

1686
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:38,490
full of pellets.
Oh,

1687
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:39,630
easy.
Easy.

1688
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,553
I think they said I think one bag of 
pellets is equivalent to like a full 

1689
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:44,610
propane thing.
Yeah.

1690
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:48,020
So this is what we cooked and Camp John 
made a.

1691
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:51,000
That is what's called the backstrap,
which is,

1692
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:52,590
uh,
would be uh,

1693
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,870
essentially a tomahawk cut.
Yeah.

1694
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:00,260
It was a full of a full section of 
Tomahawk steaks.

1695
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,300
Those are all elk.
There's a pot in the back,

1696
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:04,134
so it's basically the rib and where the 
rib goes up to the top of the back and 

1697
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:08,934
the back that meet that goes along the 
top of the spine is what most people 

1698
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,840
like best at Elc.
Yeah.

1699
01:21:14,841 --> 01:21:18,450
You gotta find that picture of.
So he cooked it like that with um,

1700
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:22,110
with the bones attached just for 
novelty,

1701
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:27,070
but it was super delicious.
People like having that handled the chow

1702
01:21:27,071 --> 01:21:27,904
down on it was super delicious and the 
fact that we were doing in camp from an 

1703
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:35,610
elk that you had shot literally the day 
before it was as fresh as it gets.

1704
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:36,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

1705
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,590
And then you do an n in the mountains,
the view out there and just

1706
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,760
incredible.
Yeah,

1707
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:41,900
it was awesome.
It was,

1708
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:42,883
I was happy to,
to tag out early just because of the 

1709
01:21:46,221 --> 01:21:50,240
fact I was at know.
I had a lot of good friends there and we

1710
01:21:50,241 --> 01:21:54,000
were able to,
to grill out and chill out and,

1711
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:58,930
and I think we probably ate about a 
third of that thing over it a lot.

1712
01:21:58,931 --> 01:22:00,440
But yeah,
we ate a ton of it.

1713
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:03,170
We ate a ton of it.
Which when you were in Alberta,

1714
01:22:03,171 --> 01:22:06,500
you shot a deer early in your hunt.
Didn't you guys eat the.

1715
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:08,520
Almost the entire dear,
dear.

1716
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:09,920
Yeah,
we did.

1717
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,940
Yeah,
we did.

1718
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,100
That's a big ass dear to.
Yeah,

1719
01:22:13,101 --> 01:22:14,450
we ate a ton of,
uh,

1720
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:17,480
Andy's elk too.
When Andy Shadows bull on nine slash 11.

1721
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:20,600
We still had I think five days left of 
hunting,

1722
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:24,280
so we ate elk three meals a day.
I'm.

1723
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,480
One of the things I always do is I'll 
always take a trigger with me or,

1724
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:30,720
or um,
you know,

1725
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,633
honestly it sounds weird,
but it's an investment to even if it's 

1726
01:22:34,641 --> 01:22:35,474
one of the portable ones,
just to get one there to that new one 

1727
01:22:37,731 --> 01:22:38,930
that they have is awesome.

1728
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:40,610
The ranger,
really small one.

1729
01:22:40,611 --> 01:22:42,350
Yep.
That thing is perfect.

1730
01:22:42,351 --> 01:22:44,330
Yeah.
And it's not heavy either.

1731
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:47,060
No,
that is the perfect size for,

1732
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:48,290
for camping.
Yeah.

1733
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:50,360
It's,
I'm trying to think.

1734
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:51,890
I don't know what the weight is,
but yeah,

1735
01:22:51,891 --> 01:22:54,050
it's perfect for camping and you can 
just plug it in.

1736
01:22:54,051 --> 01:22:59,051
Like I have a ram truck and you can 
actually just plug in right inside.

1737
01:22:59,301 --> 01:23:00,134
I normally just have an extension cord 
and run it through the rear window and 

1738
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:04,964
just plug and go.
I mean I took one with me and Sharon 

1739
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:13,240
went down to Oklahoma hunting and 
actually a thing right there.

1740
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,380
Yup.
Yeah.

1741
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:16,780
How much does that thing,
where does it say?

1742
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,350
I don't know.
It's not super late because I mean they,

1743
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,030
they're,
they are heavy.

1744
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,070
They are heavy duty.
Forty one pounds.

1745
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,360
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1746
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:27,190
Yeah.
I mean it's for,

1747
01:23:27,191 --> 01:23:28,330
on the go.
It's awesome.

1748
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,820
In the new ranger,
one's actually a little better than that

1749
01:23:30,821 --> 01:23:32,080
one.
It's got a digital.

1750
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:37,170
It's got a digital scale for the 
thermostat is a new one for sale.

1751
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,490
Yeah.
Whereas this one sold out.

1752
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,350
Sold out there was the new one's called 
the ranger.

1753
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:46,810
Um,
but yeah,

1754
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,070
they're,
they're dynamite.

1755
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:49,240
You can just plug them in.
You don't.

1756
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,330
Well we were talking.
Yeah,

1757
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:54,460
there it is right there.
Three 99.

1758
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,540
Yeah,
that's the thing,

1759
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:57,850
you know,
if you lived in the city,

1760
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:58,743
like I forgot to bring them up a lot 
just because I think what he does is 

1761
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:02,500
cool.
But um,

1762
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,423
I've got a buddy that lives in New York 
and I found them on instagram working 

1763
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:08,630
out in central park all the time.
And uh,

1764
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,513
one time I was in,
I was close to central park in the 

1765
01:24:11,411 --> 01:24:13,180
morning and I knew he always worked out 
early,

1766
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,520
so I texted him like five in the 
morning.

1767
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,350
I said,
hey dude said,

1768
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:19,030
are you up?
And you text back and said,

1769
01:24:19,031 --> 01:24:20,350
yeah,
his name is Joseph.

1770
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:21,273
And I said,
I want to do one of these central park 

1771
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:26,650
workouts with you.
Any just carries some supplies and a big

1772
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:29,830
backpack.
And he rux in and then he literally just

1773
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:34,240
like has certain rocks and stuff and he 
has a.

1774
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,350
If he got there and you were on his 
rock,

1775
01:24:36,351 --> 01:24:38,560
will you get mad?
No,

1776
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:42,010
he would be happy.
See if you got to learn a lesson here by

1777
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:43,490
Joseph.
Um,

1778
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:44,500
yeah,
exactly.

1779
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:47,380
So I did a workout with them,
but you know,

1780
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:48,910
he was telling me he's like,
you know,

1781
01:24:48,911 --> 01:24:51,130
if you ever get any of that elk meat or 
anything I'd love,

1782
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:55,590
I'd love to try it.
And he's big into I think Quito.

1783
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,793
Uh,
but he was telling me how much he pays 

1784
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:02,290
for store bought meat in New York and 
I'm like,

1785
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:05,170
oh my goodness,
that is astronomical.

1786
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:06,483
And he's like,
and I don't really know where it comes 

1787
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:08,410
from,
you know?

1788
01:25:08,411 --> 01:25:11,080
And for someone that's,
that in tune with his body,

1789
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:15,520
he was kind of disappointed that that's 
what his options were.

1790
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:17,080
But then I started thinking,
I'm like,

1791
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:18,070
well,
do you have,

1792
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,710
do you have the ability for like a 
grill,

1793
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,573
you know,
living in Iowa or live in where you 

1794
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:23,441
know,
you are.

1795
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:25,330
We've got some,
some big grills.

1796
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:26,164
We have the space for it,
but some people are thinking back to 

1797
01:25:28,901 --> 01:25:31,450
myself when I was in my twenties living 
in an apartment,

1798
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:34,570
I wouldn't have had the space for that.
That right there is a great,

1799
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:36,820
great option.
You know,

1800
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:39,820
it's literally not much bigger.
And a couple of briefcases,

1801
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:41,650
put it on your patio,
put it on your patio.

1802
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:42,484
If you're cooking for two,
it would be perfect and you can easily 

1803
01:25:45,401 --> 01:25:46,420
cook for two on that thing.

1804
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,253
You can cook for more than two on that 
thing in the cleanup is the most 

1805
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:53,620
important thing with any pellet grill.
If anyone's ever going to get one.

1806
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:56,980
The two things I can tell you our most 
important is one,

1807
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,400
just recognize that you know,
it runs off a wooden pellet.

1808
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:03,950
So treat pellet,
treat the like you would,

1809
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,390
campfire would,
you know,

1810
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:06,224
if you're,
if you leave camp firewood out where 

1811
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:08,414
it's getting rained on all the time,
you know it's going to be a pain to 

1812
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:12,980
start it or it's not going to burn that.
Great.

1813
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:16,310
So if you keep those dry,
I always put my pellets after I pour the

1814
01:26:16,311 --> 01:26:17,720
bag in,
whatever's left,

1815
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,690
I actually put in one of my Yeti buckets
and put that,

1816
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:22,130
you know,
that kind of.

1817
01:26:22,131 --> 01:26:22,910
It's,
I dunno,

1818
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:25,700
it's like a sealable lid that I pushed 
down.

1819
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:27,830
Um,
trigger makes buckets.

1820
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:31,640
They're made specifically for them.
They sent me a couple of the buckets are

1821
01:26:31,641 --> 01:26:33,110
good,
but keeping your Palette,

1822
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:33,973
you know,
if you're in a high humidity place like 

1823
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:38,180
Florida,
you don't keep,

1824
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:42,260
don't keep your pellets outside.
Um,

1825
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,150
you know,
if they're in the grill and you're using

1826
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:44,990
the grill,
that's one thing,

1827
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,990
but don't keep the bags out there all 
the time.

1828
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:51,230
And then as you use it,
there's the little,

1829
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:53,420
it's called a,
I think they call it a burning pot.

1830
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,820
Essentially your pellets are burning in 
a small pot.

1831
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:59,120
Uh,
think of that just the same as you would

1832
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:01,940
a campfire pit as you're burning wood 
all the time.

1833
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,470
There's going to be ash left in.
If that pot fills up with ash,

1834
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,453
there's not going to be the ability for 
as much pellets to go in there so it's 

1835
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:12,260
not going to burn as hot.
So,

1836
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:15,080
you know,
if you get to the point where you're not

1837
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:15,943
able to get to your higher temperatures,
it's probably because you have too much 

1838
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,980
as you've got too much ash in your pot.
So yeah,

1839
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:24,070
clean it out and then,
you know,

1840
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,440
pretty much from there.
And be easy,

1841
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:28,880
as easy as flipping it to on and turn it
to the,

1842
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:29,880
to the template.

1843
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:30,571
Sure.
That you want.

1844
01:27:30,571 --> 01:27:31,410
And it's done.
Yeah.

1845
01:27:31,411 --> 01:27:33,750
I was telling you that I tried cooking 
on a regular grill,

1846
01:27:33,751 --> 01:27:36,450
a propane grill the other day,
and it just sucked.

1847
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:40,950
It was flaring up.
There's a fire and smoke because the fat

1848
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:44,670
was dripping down into the fire.
It's a shitty way of cooking.

1849
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:48,390
They do have a really cool grill though.
The cooks from above.

1850
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,790
I've seen one of those.
It's pretty bad ass.

1851
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,020
Like you,
you,

1852
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:52,913
uh,
you can raise or lower the heat and 

1853
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:58,530
bring it closer to the meat or lifted 
above.

1854
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:01,170
And so you don't get any flare ups.
Just cooks from above.

1855
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,110
Well,
it's definitely a better way to do it if

1856
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,600
you're using propane because that I 
remember,

1857
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,033
I remember once I bought some,
some rib eyes and this was back when I 

1858
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:12,800
didn't have the money to buy good 
steaks,

1859
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:13,634
but I had some people who are and I 
thought I'm going to buy some good 

1860
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:15,794
steaks.
Went out and spent quite a bit getting 

1861
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:21,860
some good rib eyes and everything.
And because there's so much marbling,

1862
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:25,250
I remember I came inside,
I had those on the grill,

1863
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:27,710
it didn't even have them that high for 
temperature.

1864
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:31,830
I came inside and I started working on 
vegetables are pouring drinks for people

1865
01:28:31,831 --> 01:28:32,664
and all of a sudden I look out and 
there's just smoke rolling out of my 

1866
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:39,470
Weber and I go out there and lift it up 
and I revise all that marbling.

1867
01:28:39,471 --> 01:28:42,560
Just,
it was just a big burning mess.

1868
01:28:42,561 --> 01:28:45,320
It looked like I took a flame thrower to
one half of my rib eyes.

1869
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,670
So bummed out.

1870
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,310
Yeah.
It's hard doing it right.

1871
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,091
Yeah.
That's,

1872
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:49,924
there's an art to cooking.
There is one of the things that I'm 

1873
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:52,983
really a learning from getting into 
hunting and getting into cooking my own 

1874
01:28:56,441 --> 01:29:00,280
food is learning how to do it correctly.
And it's fun.

1875
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:01,830
There's a real art it,
you know,

1876
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:02,743
like think that net gross that you made 
or like some of the more interesting 

1877
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:07,200
things.
Do you ever do shanks?

1878
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,610
Yeah.
Yeah,

1879
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:09,623
I did.
Um,

1880
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,610
I did two last week.
Um,

1881
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:12,893
I shot that white tail in South Dakota 
and I took both of the front quarters 

1882
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,260
and then did slow cooks with those in 
there.

1883
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,100
They're awesome.
You know,

1884
01:29:24,101 --> 01:29:24,934
the,
the key for any of that stuff that 

1885
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:29,970
normally has a lot of tendons and stuff 
that's a tougher section of the meat.

1886
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:31,283
A lot of people try to cook them too 
fast and you don't break down that 

1887
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:35,170
Cartlidge,
you know,

1888
01:29:35,171 --> 01:29:40,171
you need that cartilage to really cook 
slow to the point where like gels and it

1889
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:43,600
breaks down and it almost turns into 
marbling in it.

1890
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,453
Then it'll turn into flavoring,
which is kind of what happened with 

1891
01:29:46,441 --> 01:29:47,610
that,
with the neck,

1892
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:49,920
you know,
once it cooks slow enough,

1893
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,260
even all those harder tendons that are 
in there,

1894
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,393
they just slowly start decomposing them,
become more of a marbling that's mixed 

1895
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:57,360
in.

1896
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,550
And it's really,
really good.

1897
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,290
I mean it's,
it's awesome.

1898
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,333
And I'm,
I'm a big advocate on the simpler you 

1899
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:10,650
keep things cooking wise for me,
the better the flavors are that I get.

1900
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:14,880
I'm a very simple cook and when people 
asked me to do,

1901
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,233
you know,
people see pictures that I post cooking 

1902
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:18,773
and they're like,
well,

1903
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:20,580
you know,
you need to do a cookbook.

1904
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:21,840
No,
I'm not.

1905
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,390
My cookbook would be boring because it 
would be,

1906
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:26,610
you know,
olive oil probably,

1907
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:27,663
you know,
I would have coffee for rub and have 

1908
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:31,630
like a prime rib rub,
you know,

1909
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,590
probably a decent like rock salt.
But other than that,

1910
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:38,760
like grass fed butters,
olive oils or a couple basic rubs,

1911
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:42,810
that's all I use period in a bone broth 
if I do like a.

1912
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:44,003
If I cook something slow to break down,
but I just literally stay with those 

1913
01:30:48,601 --> 01:30:50,820
staple things.
And from there,

1914
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,610
you know,
I'll cook according to the directions.

1915
01:30:53,611 --> 01:30:54,444
One of the things I learned to do was,
was rest my meat so I won't take meat 

1916
01:30:59,031 --> 01:31:00,530
off and just cut right into it.

1917
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,430
And you rested in a cooler?
Yeah,

1918
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:04,170
I read it.
And a Yeti all the time.

1919
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:05,423
All the time.
Cover it with aluminum foil and the 

1920
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,090
butcher paper.
Either when you do it,

1921
01:31:09,091 --> 01:31:10,830
like do you get it to a certain 
temperature?

1922
01:31:10,831 --> 01:31:11,664
Really?
Say if you want your meat to hit an 

1923
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,520
internal temperature,
like 1:30,

1924
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:17,790
do you get it to like 1:20
and then put it in the core and then let

1925
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:18,624
it rise to like 1:30
while it's in there because it keeps 

1926
01:31:20,971 --> 01:31:21,730
cooking.
Right.

1927
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:23,460
Because it's gonna.
It's gonna rise.

1928
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:25,470
Some it will rise.
Um,

1929
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,840
you got to plan that out before you 
arrested too.

1930
01:31:27,841 --> 01:31:29,250
If you're going to do it in a cooler,
right?

1931
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:30,980
Yeah.
Normally I do.

1932
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:33,240
It depends how long you're going to rest
it.

1933
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,630
Normally I plan on about six degrees.
It'll go up.

1934
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:39,600
But you can,
as you're resting in the cooler,

1935
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:41,030
you can still check it,
you know,

1936
01:31:41,031 --> 01:31:44,040
you can let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes 
and then check it.

1937
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:46,950
Normally for me,
five degrees is a really good number.

1938
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:49,340
Like if I'll stop five degrees less than
where

1939
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,700
eat it because when I put it in there 
and wrap it up,

1940
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:53,653
most vegetables for me take 20 minutes.
Like as soon as I pull that off my 

1941
01:31:57,591 --> 01:31:58,424
trigger,
I'll turn it up to high and then take 

1942
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:04,270
vegetables.
I just like tossed in olive oil and I'll

1943
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:07,180
season them with a basic rub,
put them in there,

1944
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:09,160
but anything like Broccoli,
asparagus,

1945
01:32:09,161 --> 01:32:11,370
peppers,
cauliflower,

1946
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,213
anything like that that I cook on there 
isn't going to take 20 minutes roughly 

1947
01:32:15,131 --> 01:32:18,370
on high and the meat is just resting at 
that point.

1948
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:22,450
And then I can literally pull the meat 
off if I want to do reverse sear,

1949
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:23,284
I can do it just long enough to where 
that temperature hits the exact number 

1950
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:28,840
if it hadn't reached that yet.
Um,

1951
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:31,690
otherwise I can just slice it and 
according to,

1952
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:32,613
you know,
the color throughout that I'll serve it 

1953
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:37,780
out to everybody according to whether 
they want something a little more done.

1954
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:39,830
You give them.
One of the NPS is if people want it less

1955
01:32:39,831 --> 01:32:41,260
done,
you give them the peace in the middle.

1956
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:42,463
Um,
but typically if I'm going to let it 

1957
01:32:43,241 --> 01:32:47,500
rest for 20 minutes,
I'll pull it about 129 degrees because I

1958
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:50,620
like mine at like 1:35
or so you like,

1959
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:52,030
here's a little less.
You like yours?

1960
01:32:52,031 --> 01:32:52,864
A little redder than me.
I think he like yours that more like 

1961
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:56,350
1:30
finished don't yet.

1962
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:00,700
That's the other thing too is besides 
keeping,

1963
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:01,603
you know,
the basics for seasoning is those 

1964
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:08,560
thermopolis right?
I mean if you have a probe,

1965
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:12,920
that's the one thing that I learned from
our buddy Chad Ward is,

1966
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,110
you know,
when he travels,

1967
01:33:14,111 --> 01:33:14,944
he travels with a good knife and he 
travels with a probe and minds from 

1968
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:20,500
thermo works,
um,

1969
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:21,373
is one I got as a gift someone gave me 
and I can tell you that that was one of 

1970
01:33:25,031 --> 01:33:26,290
the best things to get.

1971
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:31,760
I have a regular internal thermometer 
that's really cool because I can keep it

1972
01:33:32,811 --> 01:33:36,980
in the kitchen and it's got a one probe 
and then the,

1973
01:33:36,981 --> 01:33:37,814
uh,
it registers to a second unit which you 

1974
01:33:41,091 --> 01:33:43,800
can keep as a remote.
You keep it far,

1975
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:46,610
far away from the grill.
It tells you what's going on.

1976
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:48,650
It's like Bluetooth or something or 
wireless.

1977
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,590
Yup.
I'm Steve Rinella.

1978
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:52,790
Actually has a really good cook book 
that just came out.

1979
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,740
I should say that I was going to have it
in here today.

1980
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:55,883
Uh,
he sent it to my house and it's at my 

1981
01:33:57,141 --> 01:33:58,980
house right now,
but yeah,

1982
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:03,020
literally just came out his own Ninja 
Ninja level.

1983
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:03,913
Yeah.
If you want to take things to the next 

1984
01:34:05,061 --> 01:34:07,250
level.
I mean he is,

1985
01:34:07,251 --> 01:34:08,300
uh,
he's,

1986
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:09,193
he's,
he's one of those rare guys that has a 

1987
01:34:11,631 --> 01:34:13,670
television show,
a hunting television show.

1988
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,553
We're literally,
most of the episodes is cooking 

1989
01:34:16,341 --> 01:34:17,000
something.

1990
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,700
That's it right now.
Mediator fishing game cookbook.

1991
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,560
Okay.
It's available November 20th.

1992
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,060
It's not available to you.
Fucks yet.

1993
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:26,000
I already have it.
Sorry folks.

1994
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,650
But uh,
it's really good though.

1995
01:34:27,651 --> 01:34:28,484
It's excellent.
He sent me a publisher's version that 

1996
01:34:31,281 --> 01:34:35,180
had like just black and white photos,
but I just got the full version a couple

1997
01:34:35,181 --> 01:34:38,060
of days ago and it's really excellent 
and,

1998
01:34:38,061 --> 01:34:38,894
but he's got really,
really cool recipes and interesting 

1999
01:34:41,601 --> 01:34:42,190
stuff.
And,

2000
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:44,360
and if you don't have any wild game 
meat,

2001
01:34:44,361 --> 01:34:47,150
you could always buy bison from 
supermarkets.

2002
01:34:47,151 --> 01:34:51,440
Some supermarkets have that and you 
could cook that and cook it in the same.

2003
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:55,130
We're going to bust advice and this 
winter.

2004
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:56,083
Yeah,
for a good cause to come in and a 

2005
01:34:57,171 --> 01:34:58,160
fucking bice and

2006
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,950
code ons on.
I want to do all my podcasts.

2007
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:04,080
That giant Bison coat better get an air 
conditioner.

2008
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,990
This sucker dude.
I love Bison.

2009
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:06,900
Yeah,
it's delicious.

2010
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,480
It is,
it is awesome.

2011
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:10,460
It is awesome.
Yeah.

2012
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:12,110
Um,
you,

2013
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,330
myself and our buddy andy stump,
we're going to go,

2014
01:35:14,490 --> 01:35:16,790
uh,
for sure.

2015
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:17,624
Me and Andy,
both of our bison are going to be for 

2016
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:25,480
that meat is going to have a purpose.
I'm andy and I kinda,

2017
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,170
I don't know,
through,

2018
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:29,180
through some just talk at a hunting 
camp.

2019
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:32,630
Kind of started this thing that we call 
free range American.

2020
01:35:32,631 --> 01:35:33,560
Right?
And it's,

2021
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,810
it's literally brand that's not really 
about us.

2022
01:35:35,811 --> 01:35:36,644
It's just about all of these we have,
we have all these friends that just do 

2023
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,124
crazy stuff.
And Andy's arguably one of the craziest 

2024
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:44,450
friends.
I got crazy.

2025
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:45,284
Yeah.
He's probably the craziest holds the 

2026
01:35:46,281 --> 01:35:48,560
world record for the furthest distance 
travel.

2027
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,530
When those flying squirrel suit,
he's out of his fucking mind.

2028
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,510
He is the craziest,
but we just,

2029
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:56,810
one time we were just talking about um,
you know,

2030
01:35:56,811 --> 01:35:59,840
just awesome shit people do and he's 
like,

2031
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:00,800
you know,
we need to just,

2032
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:02,760
we just need to motivate people.
And,

2033
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:07,010
and just talk people into tagging us 
when they do awesome shit.

2034
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:08,520
And so then,
uh,

2035
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:09,603
sure.
Yeah,

2036
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:10,630
the shirt you're wearing.
Yeah.

2037
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:12,103
Yeah.
And did you guys start this company 

2038
01:36:13,161 --> 01:36:15,130
together as teacher company?
Yeah.

2039
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:17,090
Yeah.
Well it's more than just that,

2040
01:36:17,091 --> 01:36:19,150
but yeah,
the entire brand or you know,

2041
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:24,170
like the social media stuff is all just,
it's based around people that,

2042
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,870
you know,
just tag us with the Hashtag,

2043
01:36:26,871 --> 01:36:27,704
do awesome shit.
And they show us what they're doing is 

2044
01:36:28,911 --> 01:36:32,420
free ranging Americans and you know,
it's anything,

2045
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:35,420
it's not just what Andy and I like.
I mean if we,

2046
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:36,530
you know,
we uh,

2047
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:42,050
you know,
some guys are firemen that just do crazy

2048
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:42,470
stuff.

2049
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,150
There's people that have some,
you know,

2050
01:36:44,151 --> 01:36:46,400
there's been some motor,
some imacs,

2051
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:50,750
guys that just post some crazy ass 
pictures like Shane Dorian,

2052
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:54,200
some of the waves he's on,
that's just crazy shit that he's,

2053
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:56,390
what are you going to do with the meat 
from the license?

2054
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,210
We're gonna.
Um,

2055
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:00,950
Andy's got a big,
uh,

2056
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,980
a big fifth wheel calls it,
the do awesome shit.

2057
01:37:03,981 --> 01:37:07,220
Immobile.
And we're going to pull that from.

2058
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:09,290
We're going to start on the west coast,
um,

2059
01:37:09,410 --> 01:37:12,580
this spring and we're going to start,
um,

2060
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:13,843
were andy went through buds and we're 
going to hit a base for one of each of 

2061
01:37:17,871 --> 01:37:18,704
the military branches.
We're going to try to end at Fort Bragg 

2062
01:37:21,171 --> 01:37:22,990
where I was born.
Um,

We're going to end with a,

2064
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:26,953
with the army and we're going to go to 
basis and we're just gonna Cook wild

triggers and we're gonna we're gonna.

2069
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:45,980
Get these bisons ground up to do some,

2070
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:46,843
some cool bison burgers and stuff like 
that and just hit a bunch of military 

2071
01:37:49,581 --> 01:37:51,340
bases.
You're going to need a lot.

2072
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,333
We're gonna.
Take some buffaloes down and then we're 

2073
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:56,190
gonna we're going to also have some 
really cool brands,

2074
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:57,300
uh,
supporting us.

2075
01:37:57,301 --> 01:37:58,134
But yeah,
we're more or less just trying to 

2076
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:01,050
support the troops,
um,

2077
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:02,123
promote,
you know,

2078
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,960
clean eating,
doing awesome shit.

2079
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:06,030
And um,
it's going to be fun.

2080
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:10,060
So we're still working out the details,
but that's going to be coming and uh,

2081
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:13,560
I'm super thankful all my,
all my friends that are,

2082
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:17,040
that are military base or have served 
for us and,

2083
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,450
and uh,
you know,

2084
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:21,750
it's just another way that I can do one 
of the few things I'm good at.

2085
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:24,880
I can show people how to shoot archery 
or I can cook for them.

2086
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:27,870
That's kind of my forte.
And uh,

2087
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,280
yeah,
I'm looking forward to it.

2088
01:38:29,281 --> 01:38:32,850
I think it's going to be.
I think it's going to be a mobile party.

2089
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,120
That sounds fun.
Giving them down.

2090
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:36,400
I'll,
I'll let people know.

2091
01:38:36,401 --> 01:38:37,234
I'll put it on social media and we'll 
talk about it here and let folks know a 

2092
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:44,200
John Kavanagh should be here any second 
now if he's not already here,

2093
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:46,990
I don't know if they're here yet or they
hit someone's here.

2094
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:47,883
They're here.
Okay.

2095
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:50,860
So we're going to talk to conor 
Mcgregor's coach and George Lockhart,

2096
01:38:50,861 --> 01:38:53,880
who's Connor's a,
um,

2097
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:54,813
weight cutting coach.
And I think he does his nutrition as 

2098
01:38:56,831 --> 01:38:58,240
well.
Looked at and talked to him,

2099
01:38:58,241 --> 01:39:00,880
did look dynamite while he's getting 
fucked up.

2100
01:39:01,150 --> 01:39:06,150
Pretty good to fucking hard sport.
It's a hard sport,

2101
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,090
you know,
he,

2102
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:08,770
he,
I'll tell you one thing though.

2103
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:09,663
He is,
it would have been nice to talk to him 

2104
01:39:11,771 --> 01:39:16,090
afterwards because I think he would have
been gracious in defeat.

2105
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,160
I really do.
Yeah,

2106
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,970
I agree with ast.
I agree.

2107
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:21,730
I think he was on social media,
you know,

2108
01:39:21,731 --> 01:39:23,650
he said it was a good crack,
you know,

2109
01:39:23,651 --> 01:39:25,900
uh,
I mean maybe we'll get a rematch,

2110
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:26,933
you know,
he talked to tremendous amount of shit 

2111
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,610
and it's just hard for people to recover
from that.

2112
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:34,390
But part of the game,
part of the fun part of it.

2113
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:35,590
John Dudley.
Alright.

2114

A knock on TV.
You can catch him on instagram and you 

2115
01:39:40,451 --> 01:39:42,310
could.
No,

2116
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,780
