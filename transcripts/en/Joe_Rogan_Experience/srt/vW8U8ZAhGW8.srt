1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,290
All right. Uh, I'm here
with Kevin Folta, Kevin,

2
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:08,400
your a scientist,

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:13,401
a GMO foods expert and if there is one
subject that gets beaten to death online

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,900
and in conversation
and butchered. I, I've,

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,990
I've heard many conversations that I had
to just walk away from at parties where

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,520
people started talking about what GMO
foods do and what's going to happen and

7
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:27,570
all the horrible things.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,100
Gmo Foods are probably one of the most
confusing and also one of the most hated

9
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:38,460
things in,
in the world today,

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,350
but also one of the most common
and most misunderstood, right?

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,720
I mean almost everything,
there's a,

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,530
Neil degrasse Tyson did a video about
this where he was kind of explaining like

13
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:54,180
the term GMO foods,
like virtually everything you see,

14
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:58,440
including things that are quote unquote
organic at a supermarket have been

15
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:02,760
modified in some way in order to prolong
the shelf life in order for them to

16
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,660
taste better,

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,810
including corn and tomatoes
and oranges and you name it.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,990
Yeah, I think that's the big problem
is that when you frame this very well,

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,530
the problem is that we
confuse this idea of GMO,

20
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:21,531
which is kind of a pejorative term that
we've derived to a kind of misrepresent

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,450
this kind of technology, which is really
just plant genetic improvement. Um,

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,280
like you say, we've been improving
plants for 10,000 years as a species.

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,570
We find the ones that work best and we
continue to select those particular lines

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,450
that have benefits for us.
And we'd been doing this for a long time,

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,600
so everything is different
than it was in the wild.

26
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,280
If you look at the natural forms,

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,830
there are nothing like what
you see today in the store.

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
So this GMO thing is just the most recent
way that we've been able to modify the

29
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,420
way a plant behaves and
what plant products are.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,660
And it just is a much more precise
extension of conventional breeding.

31
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,050
But there is a company that looms like
the death star out there in the world of

32
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,390
GMO foods. And that company, I
don't even have to say the name,

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,340
it's spoken in hushed terms around
Hippie campfires. Monsanto. Yeah, right.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,410
And well, Monsanto was also
responsible for a lot of good things.

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,020
I'm sure they, they have done some
creepy shit and they have, uh,

36
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,000
gotten, especially in
India, I mean they're,

37
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,010
they're directly connected to the suicides
of countless farmers who can't afford

38
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,400
to use their seed. They have to
replace every year. I mean there's,

39
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,210
there's good and bad when it comes
to the ability to modify things.

40
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,650
And I think what terrifies some people
is that a company like Monsanto,

41
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,810
which has just ungodly amounts of
money and influence and power. I mean,

42
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:53,670
they'd been sued by the
Brazilian government and
Brazil sued them and won. And,

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,070
uh, I don't know the exact
specifics of the case,

44
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:00,220
but it's essentially about those
seeds that explain those terminator

45
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,980
seeds, if you could, and how
those things were created. Okay.

46
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,810
So you touched on three important
points there and we can come back to the

47
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,570
suicides and also Monsanto
being a giant company. Um,

48
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,330
and I should not wear it off the top. I
have nothing to do with Monsanto. I'm not,

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,090
you know, I don't work for them. I'm
a scientist at the, wait a minute,

50
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:19,760
I've read online that you are a shill.
That's right. You are not a chef.

51
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,120
I am not a shell. I'm actually,
I'm a shill for you. I
actually, I'm, I'm a, I'm a,

52
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,220
I'm a, I'm a public scientist. I
work for the University of Florida.

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm the chairman of a
horticultural sciences department
in a state where we grow

54
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,830
almost no GM crops.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,360
The differences is that I see tremendous
potential for how these technologies

56
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:42,190
could be helpful for our farmers and we
try to get them excited about ways that

57
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:46,570
we can apply them in the future. But let
me go back to your last question about,

58
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:50,650
cause I don't even know much about this
Brazil issue either, but what you mean,

59
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:54,460
I'm sure you could pull up the article.
We'd see it on the big screen. Yeah.

60
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:57,820
So your last, the last question
out of that was the terminator,

61
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,100
the terminator seeds and
the terminator seeds.

62
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,450
This is something that never existed in
terms of a product that was available.

63
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,810
A company called Delta pine in land back
in the 1990s develop the technology to

64
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:14,851
ensure that a genetically engineered
seeds would stay in the fields they were

65
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:19,150
planted, that you wouldn't have pollen
leaving and pollinating something else and

66
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:22,570
creating plants and other places.
Pretty good idea for containment.

67
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,340
And Delta Pine and land
had this technology where
basically the embryo of the

68
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:30,010
seed didn't develop properly.
So it was a dead end.

69
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,900
You couldn't replant
it and get it to grow.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,330
So when Delta Pine and land later
was bought out by the big Yam,

71
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,330
by Monsanto,
everybody saw the terminal value.

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,580
It wasn't called the terminator
seed had some other name,

73
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,160
but it quickly gained the name Terminator.

74
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,250
And so these were never grown
outside of a greenhouse.

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,790
And the company has said they never will
grow them outside of a greenhouse just

76
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,120
because of the, uh, overlaid
implications of what they might mean.

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,040
But there have been
instances of GMO crops,

78
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,370
but by pollination,
uh,

79
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,430
infecting the lands of people who are not
supposed to have these Monsanto crops.

80
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:12,130
On. And they were sued for having these
crops growing on their land. Correct.

81
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,680
There's examples where people have
had litigation because they've, uh,

82
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,800
they've generated the seeds
that are a licensed product.

83
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:22,540
So in other words,
when you're a farmer,

84
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,020
you buy the seeds from the company and
it's Monsanto or any of the companies

85
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:26,950
that sell the seeds.

86
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,310
There's six different companies now
you buy the seeds from any of those

87
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:34,870
companies, you fill out a form saying,
uh, I agreed to not grow more of this.

88
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,610
And so there are cases where people have
grown more of it and hasn't been from a

89
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,590
little bit of pollen
drifting into a field.

90
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,680
The court cases are all public record
in the ones where they had been

91
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,330
successfully tried and litigated,

92
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,800
they've been for thousands of acres of
plants that somewhat would knowingly grow

93
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,580
and maybe even treat with roundup in many
cases so that they were selecting for

94
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:58,010
the trait. The intent was to sell
the seeds that they agreed not

95
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,990
to sell. Oh, okay.

96
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:04,700
So these stories about farmers
that were getting sued because of

97
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:08,870
crosspollination because they're,
the GMO crops have infected their,

98
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,900
their land is not true. That's
not, there's no evidence in the,

99
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,910
in the record to show that this is
substantiated and what's even Numb, uh,

100
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,950
more scary about that is that is that
when the company has litigated any of

101
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,900
these and one favorable court decisions,

102
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,730
they haven't kept the money
that any damages went back
into the community. So, um,

103
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,450
again, that's, what do you mean by that?

104
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,810
Just went back to the
community that if they saw,

105
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:36,080
if they sued a farmer and
actually won the case,

106
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,270
any of the funding that was a one is a
penalty from that case was given back to

107
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:44,630
the community where that
farmer lived back in what form?

108
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,500
I guess just guess just financial
support for whatever I, it was just,

109
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,730
the idea they wanted to get around was
that they were somehow suing farmers to

110
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:57,170
get rich or to pocket the funds.
And so they created this opera wealth,

111
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:00,110
this plan or this program to put
the money back where it came.

112
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,450
So where are these farmers get
the seeds then? If they, they had,

113
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,670
they illegally acquired
these seeds somehow. Is that,
what's the implication? Well,

114
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:12,671
if you were to go buy corn from let's
say Monsanto or Dow or any of the

115
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,940
companies that make it and
you were to grow, say, uh,

116
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,730
soybeans that were roundup resistance
so that you, they resist the herbicide,

117
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,070
you can kill the weeds,
but let this plant's growth through a,

118
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,000
if you were to buy those and you
were to spray them and then, uh,

119
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,750
keep the seeds and then grow a,

120
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,780
bulk them up and then start
selling them out of your garage,

121
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,720
the company would come and
say, no, you can't do that.

122
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,170
So this is what you're doing is you're
taking the corn and the corn itself is

123
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:46,730
essentially seed, right? Like
the actual, the ears of corn,

124
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,590
you can grow corn from that corn
and that's what they're doing. Yeah.

125
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:55,520
So they're essentially, and maybe not corn
as much, I can get to that in a second.

126
00:07:55,521 --> 00:08:00,500
But, um, things like cotton and,
and a in soil, you can't, uh, it's,

127
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:03,070
it's a lot like software and anesthesia.
Bodner dot.

128
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,570
Doctor Anesthesia Bodner is
an excellent example of this.

129
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,100
You can't go buy a copy of,
uh,

130
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,140
Microsoft office and go home and make
a thousand copies and sell them on Ebay

131
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:14,090
without Microsoft knocking on your door.

132
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,800
This is a technology that takes
years and years to develop.

133
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,510
It's a really expensive technology to
deregulate something like $130 million

134
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,500
sometimes to deregulate one of
these genetically modified lines.

135
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,730
So the company needs to make
money to maintain its R and D.

136
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,320
And so they ask farmers,

137
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:37,220
who are the beneficiaries ultimately of
this to sign an agreement saying that

138
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:41,100
they'll buy it every year. So this is
the lawsuit, the Brazilian lawsuit,

139
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,920
if you scroll up, Jim's degree, this whole
thing, it's so they face a $1 billion.

140
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,870
Well, this is in 2013. They lost
the lawsuit. Um, this is, uh, not a,

141
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,670
uh,
a recent article,

142
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,100
but the farmers that were suing for

143
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,980
abusive purchase contracts.
A scroll down a little bit there.

144
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,270
Brazil farmers court actions are piling
up against Monsanto for collecting

145
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:08,050
royalties on our r one is that
roundup, the roundup ready one, um,

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,670
regarding eleague,
uh,

147
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,870
regarded as illegal and for conditioning
the sale of new GM seeds in a,

148
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,631
I don't know what that word is,

149
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:23,631
intact and Taca Rr two to the signing
of a contract seen as abusive.

150
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,760
According to an article for Valor Online,

151
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:30,540
Brazil lawyers for the
farmers and representative
bodies estimate the value of

152
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:35,541
the claims against Monsanto at 1.9
billion Birr Brazilian Brazilian heels,

153
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,200
which is about us. 1 billion
processes have not been completed,

154
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,710
but preliminary estimates say that the
claims may affect the company's profit.

155
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,440
See if you could find a more recent
article cause they lost that lawsuit.

156
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,600
I have no clue. This is also coming
from sustainable pulse and GM watch,

157
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,430
uh, two sources which have nothing
positive to say about biotechnology.

158
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,120
And it wouldn't surprise me if another
other countries did try to litigate.

159
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,950
And these kinds of examples, they mean
it's anybody can sue a company, you know,

160
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,290
anybody can do it.
So it's a,

161
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,360
it's possible that these things
were brought before these, uh, uh,

162
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,580
governments saying that these were unfair
practices to farmers to make them sign

163
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,100
a contract and then
repurchase the seed later on.

164
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,440
So they seeds that you
were talking about before.

165
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,980
How did these folks get
them then have the, the,

166
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,870
if they're getting enough seeds to plant
thousands and thousands of acres, uh,

167
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,880
illegally, how are they doing that? Well,

168
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,570
you just saved the seeds from
the previous year instead of,

169
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,140
instead of processing and you know, you
can imagine a corn, corn cob has, uh,

170
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,610
several hundred kernels and each
one of those represents a new plant.

171
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,990
So you can have x amount of your
acreage dedicated to seed production.

172
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,470
So essentially all you would
have to do is buy, you know,

173
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:51,471
a few thousand ears of corn and you'd
be able to plant just a giant area of,

174
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,910
you know, and I wish I knew the number off
the top of my head, but I don't, but um,

175
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,000
it would be able to
plant replant more seats,

176
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,510
corns a bad example because corn are
hybrids and it without going into a whole

177
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:07,620
genetics whiteboard thing here,
you're,

178
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,770
every corn is made from two parents
that are genetically very different.

179
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,630
But when you combine them together,

180
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,130
give you a hybrid that when you
cross a hybrid with a hybrid,

181
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,760
gives you a mixture of seeds that don't
give you any uniformity in the next

182
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:26,430
generation.
So since the 1930s,

183
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,690
the seed companies have been able to
resell that hybrid seed to farmers every

184
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,080
year because there's nothing to be
gained in, in producing your own.

185
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,380
And so corn isn't always the best example.

186
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,120
And the companies have used genetics for
going on a century now to protect their

187
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:46,280
breeders interests. So
the original corners that
someone's phone, what was that?

188
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,910
The original corn,
uh,

189
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,950
before it was modified at all was that
corn that you get like for Thanksgiving,

190
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,340
but you hang on your,
your

191
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,390
door that nobody eats that weird
colored funky looking corn and it's even

192
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,350
smaller than that,
right?

193
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,370
Because the original corn was called
Teosinte and [inaudible] was a basically

194
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:07,930
growing on a Bush and Mexico and it gave
you 13 little hard kernels on a stick

195
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,330
that an implant would
produce some of this.

196
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:14,530
And it's now being thought from
archeological evidence that uh,

197
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,190
people's would take these little
corn cobs, which to call it,

198
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,090
that is kind of strange,

199
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,470
this little stick with little rocks on
it and stick it in fire and pop it and

200
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:25,750
eat it like popcorn
because it's too hard to,

201
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:28,810
you have to use a lot of water in
grinding to make any food out of it.

202
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,280
But you can imagine how exciting it was
when you were a person who is using us

203
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:34,114
for sustenance.

204
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,780
When you found a [inaudible] plant
that may be made twice as many,

205
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,520
or maybe instead of 13 kernels,

206
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:43,900
gave you 26 and so you would select
those implant them the next year.

207
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,340
And it's really interesting that now you
can go back through the 10,000 years of

208
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:49,330
corn improvement.

209
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,160
And we've been able to identify the
genes that were at all of the critical

210
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:58,180
thresholds that shifted this thing from
being a Bush with lots of little sticks

211
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,190
of kernels to being what it is today.

212
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,590
And it really is just a small
number of genes that were changed.

213
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,240
So before they started modifying genes,
how do they select, like say, how do they,

214
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,840
cause before any genetic modifications
are done in laboratories,

215
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:15,841
they had turned this GOC
what I say [inaudible] or
maize as we used to call it.

216
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,240
Right. That was the Indian
word for it. Even now,

217
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:23,220
even according to that
commercial at RBS. Yeah. Um,

218
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,580
well the maze is kind of a general
term for everything from a field corn,

219
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,590
which is what we think about,
which is fed to animals,

220
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,570
which 80% of GM crops go
to animal feed. And, uh,

221
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,180
we differentiate that versus a
what is typically eaten by humans,

222
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,070
which is usually sweet corn varieties.

223
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,720
So how did they turn it before there
was any genetic modifications done in

224
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:48,100
laboratories? How did they turn
that corn into what we now,

225
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:52,060
which is delicious and sweet and you put
butter on it, it's fantastic. Oh, sure.

226
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:55,120
Did they do that? Yeah, actually.
But it was all just random mutations.

227
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,020
DNA referendum.
Yeah.

228
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,140
DNA replication is a sloppy process and
funny things happen when you, uh, from,

229
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,100
uh, environment. So in the process
of replication of DNA itself,

230
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,490
you can make errors, um,
cosmic radiation, um,

231
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,320
just a chemicals in our environment,

232
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,560
natural chemicals that are out
there can induce changes in DNA.

233
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,050
And these kinds of mutations sometimes
very rarely result in a change in the

234
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:23,710
plant that's beneficial and at least,
or at least from a human perspective.

235
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,920
So in all the plants that we've had,
all the plants that we have,

236
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:31,921
the significant amount of change has
come from random mutations that change

237
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:37,030
genes in ways we don't understand pieces
of DNA that get up out of the genome

238
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:41,320
and sit down somewhere else randomly.
They do this all the time. Um,

239
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,490
viruses in the plants that get into the
genome and sit down in places that we

240
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:46,480
have no idea where.

241
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,900
So genetic modification is something
that's ongoing and constant andF in a

242
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:55,520
factor in every genome
including our own. And so, um,

243
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,710
what we're seeing today is just the,
uh,

244
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,670
the long term effect that of humans who've
been able to put all the good traits

245
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:02,504
in one place.

246
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,780
So when you see those tomatoes that are
in the supermarket that are Pale and you

247
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,750
could play basketball with them,
those hard tomatoes,

248
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,000
and then you compare them
to like heirloom tomatoes.

249
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:18,210
The only difference between those two
is that someone had found some tomatoes

250
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:23,251
that had grown extra firm and selected
those and use the seeds from those to

251
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:27,970
create more similar tomatoes
and only select the dose.

252
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,810
Right. So you, you, you frame two
cool things here. So heirloom,

253
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:34,560
what does an heirloom and an heirloom
is a tomato without standing eating

254
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:38,610
qualities that can't work in production
commercially cause it's too mushy.

255
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,000
It's too mushy. They don't last long and
they break down. But on the other hand,

256
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:45,450
so this is what the problem is with
our food. When you talk about tomatoes,

257
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:48,420
strawberries, blueberries, things
that these are non GMO by the way,

258
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,740
there's no GMO tomatoes or strawberries.
Not at all. People would say there are,

259
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,930
the problem is is that plant breeding
over the last 50 years or say over the

260
00:15:57,931 --> 00:16:02,640
last 100 years, the, the objectives
of the breeders has been bigger.

261
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:06,930
Fruit uniformity, big
yield, disease resistance,

262
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,660
nothing about flavor and aroma.
So to meet production characteristics,

263
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,450
which is what we've been
selecting for breeders,

264
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:19,050
have been looking for these kinds of
characteristics that don't involve the

265
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:19,884
consumer.

266
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,360
And so our decline in the flavors and
the quality of fruits and vegetables is

267
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:28,890
directly related to the mass breeding,
not anything to do with GMO.

268
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,570
So when you say genetic modified
in, in that, in those terms,

269
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,370
they are kind of genetically modified,

270
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:39,720
but they're not modified in terms of being
in a laboratory in human beings doing

271
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:41,100
some funky stuff with jeans.

272
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:46,101
They're sort of modified almost
naturally and just selected for those

273
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:47,034
modifications.

274
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:47,791
And,

275
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,340
and some of the things that we've selected
for have been the ones that didn't

276
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:55,240
kill us when we ate them or the things
that didn't make a poison that, uh,

277
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,530
or something that tasted horrible. Um,
plants make lots of funky compounds.

278
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,940
And so this was an opportunity for a,

279
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,620
so what we've seen in our stores
right now is the residue of,

280
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,750
of thousands of years of human selection.

281
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,510
And we can call it genetic
modification if we want to,

282
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:13,210
but we can differentiate it from
what we do in the laboratory,

283
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,580
which is now we can call adding a
transgene where transgenesis moving a gene

284
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:22,660
from one background of genetics
to another via laboratory.

285
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,350
And these selections that people
have moaned about and I have as well.

286
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:29,951
I mean,

287
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:33,520
it's horrible when you're going a sandwich
and has a pale tomato on it because

288
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,500
they just taste awful though.
So there's,

289
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,550
there's no science involved in any of
that other than selection. There's no,

290
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,413
there's no,

291
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,510
there's no like injection of some alien
sort of genetics into those things.

292
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:46,810
Alien to the plant.

293
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,460
Now there is no, no syringes. I'm
like that. And actually, you know,

294
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,840
it is more an art than a science being
a plant breeder is the most kick ass

295
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,920
career these days and has
been for a long time. Um,

296
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,580
plant breeding is essentially inventing
the next generation of food and all

297
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:07,080
we're talking about is a mixing pollen
from things that maybe normally wouldn't

298
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:10,290
cross together, like something
that nature would never cross.

299
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,610
But you got this cool tomato from Europe
that has great qualities and we can mix

300
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:18,240
it with this great production quality
tomato from that grows in Florida where

301
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,410
nothing else can grow.

302
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,340
And now you mix these two together and
you get this beautiful tomato that works

303
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:27,750
well and everybody's garden. That's where
we're going now. But that's not GMO.

304
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:32,250
That's just using other types of
technology to facilitate this net,

305
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,170
this breeding process that breeders do.

306
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,430
And how would you splice those two
together? Like how would you take it?

307
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:41,520
Tomato from Europe and a tomato from
Arkansas and some hard another make them

308
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:45,600
work. They'll, most of the time it's as
simple as plants. Sex, you just, uh, you,

309
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,400
we masculine one of them.
Uh,

310
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,090
you had rip all the male parts out
of it and then you add pollen from a

311
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:54,870
different flower and it's very simple
and that's what people have been doing to

312
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,450
create hybrid varieties for,
for centuries.

313
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,420
So that is not considered genetic
modified or it is wellness.

314
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,700
Back to the confusion.
It is certainly a genetic modification.

315
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,510
You're ramming together genomes that
never would have mashed together in the,

316
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,550
in the wild never. But, uh,

317
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,060
in creating a product that humans
have never seen or tasted or tested,

318
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,320
but yet we find this very
acceptable and very, uh,

319
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:23,790
even though it's a very random process,
we don't know what kind of, uh, uh,

320
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,630
those, those transposable genes, those
things jumping around genomes. Um,

321
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,390
two of the main corn types have
500 different genes between them,

322
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,030
meaning one has 500 genes
the other doesn't have.

323
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,590
So you're mixing together things that
have no commonality other than the basic

324
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:45,000
core guts of, of genes in
the genome. So this is not,

325
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:48,480
I don't think those splicing of
things is not what terrifies people.

326
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:53,481
What seems to terrify people
is the introduction of
things that are not supposed

327
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:58,080
to be in the organic plant.
And this is something that,

328
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,390
that really bugs people.
And the real,

329
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:03,570
the real fear is of disease as of cancers.

330
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:07,920
And there's all these studies that have
been done supposedly of rats that got

331
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:12,780
cancer from some sort of round
up crap. Like explain that. Okay.

332
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:15,360
So let's, uh, we can go,
let's dive into that.

333
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,780
So when we're adding genes across,
let's say,

334
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:21,240
species or across kingdoms
through a laboratory,

335
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,950
and that's what people I think are
really, uh, get strange about it,

336
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,030
really don't understand.
Um,

337
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,900
this is the part where it's actually
terribly simple and we've been doing this

338
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:35,160
since the 1980s introducing them
to the plants since the 1980s.

339
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,590
I've been studying it since then.
And uh,

340
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,620
the best example is insulin that the
human gene for insulin is cut out of the

341
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:43,740
human genome,

342
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,040
placed into a bacterium and then
gigantic fermenters of bacteria.

343
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,660
So we're talking like an organism that
is so different from humans and I then we

344
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:56,380
pull out the insulin and we use this
to inject in the patients rather than

345
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,450
relying on isolating it from
calf or a cow. I'm pancreas, um,

346
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,780
where there can be all kinds of allergic
reactions and all kinds of other issues.

347
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,310
So here we have a source of insulin that's
human insulin that's coming through a

348
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:13,960
GMO intermediate that allows humans to
live at for a low cost medicine that has

349
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:14,794
no side effects.

350
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,370
And there's a bunch of instances of
that and aren't there. There's a bar,

351
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,630
it's not just insulin that they
done with breeding it with bacteria.

352
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:23,890
It's a bunch of other things too.
Right?

353
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,930
Right. We email the main enzyme for
cheese making is called Chi Mohsen.

354
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,910
And as a camel gene that's expressed in a
bacterium and Hamill gene, yeah, it's a,

355
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,770
it seems to be the most efficient at
doing the job that Kim Wilson does. Okay.

356
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:40,590
How the hell did anybody ever figured
that out? Yeah, you just test everything.

357
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,450
You know, you'd try
everybody's different. Uh, it,

358
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,360
it's one of these
enzymes in the gut of um,

359
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,890
one of the chambers of the gut
of the ruminant stomach. And uh,

360
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,890
the camel seemed to have the one that was
the most active in vitro cause you can

361
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:53,521
do this test,

362
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:57,660
you put the different enzyme in a test
tube and see which one converts the milk

363
00:21:57,661 --> 00:22:01,700
into, uh, the cheese stuff faster.
And then you were able to, uh,

364
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,580
figure out Campbell one just because
it's a better enzyme for whatever reason.

365
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,540
Now you use that one in
bacteria and 95% of cheese,

366
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,750
it uses a GMO intermediate.
That is

367
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,683
insane.

368
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,930
How the hell did anybody ever come to
the conclusion that a camel would produce

369
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,180
best cheese? Yeah, but that's
what we do. That's what I do.

370
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,830
And that's what my colleagues do.
You know,

371
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:27,550
we've got this really cool system of a
public universities where we're using

372
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:29,650
money from public funding,
from you know,

373
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:33,310
your tax dollars to solve problems
like how to make better cheesed less

374
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,690
expensively.
Um,

375
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:39,640
that's our main thing as a land grant
university and a, and so this is,

376
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,080
these are the basic
science questions that we,

377
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,280
that we strive to answer and I
think we are doing a good job with.

378
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:49,720
And that's why this GMO thing is so
frustrating because we're so down in the

379
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:54,640
Monsanto noise or so under noise that
we have solutions that we can't use.

380
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,300
So like the camel gene, you know, it,

381
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,480
things that we don't think
of that we figured out.

382
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,260
Is it the,

383
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,450
is it because of the name because that
name is associated with this big evil

384
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:08,830
corporation that all GMO foods are
sort of looked at in this regard.

385
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,550
Because I mean people aren't freaking
out about camel genes and cheats because

386
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:13,510
they didn't know about it,

387
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,720
but everybody knows about g m o s and
they instantly connect that to Monsanto

388
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,690
and they instantly
connect Monsanto to greed.

389
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:26,170
And callousness and Indian farmers
committing suicide as we're talking.

390
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,010
Oh yeah, we got to come back to
that too. Don't let me walk on here.

391
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:31,890
That hidden that. Um, but it,
this is the problem though,

392
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:35,910
is that when you look at the real
solutions that are there in science,

393
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,030
the stuff I care about, you know,
Monsanto, if they went away tomorrow,

394
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,210
it wouldn't affect the fact
that the science is really good.

395
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,590
So they're a company that's
profiting off of the science. Well,

396
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,120
they sell a product of farmers.

397
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,710
Farmers want improved crops that dead
take in the big deal for farmers.

398
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,060
We have 1% of our people in this country
are farming to feed and clothe the rest

399
00:23:56,061 --> 00:24:00,020
of us. It's such a small amount
they're getting by on narrow margins.

400
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,500
And when you're talking
about the disasters that come
from heat waves and floods

401
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:07,800
and everything else, they're operating
just by breaking even. And so, uh,

402
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,800
farmers who can get improved seeds
that maybe don't require an insecticide

403
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,900
because the plant makes
its own protection.

404
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,180
That saves a farmer big bucks
in terms of fuel, labor, uh,

405
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,960
products that they don't have to spray.

406
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,270
And so farmers have adopted the GM
technologies faster than cell phones.

407
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:26,931
I mean these were,

408
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:31,760
these went from zero to 95% of acreage
and just a couple of years for five crops.

409
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,470
So farmers by the crops,
Monsanto makes the seeds,

410
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,280
Monsanto makes the seeds, the farmers
want the seeds and demand more.

411
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,420
And that's why Monsanto stays in business.
They make a product that farmers use.

412
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,160
Um, the Indians. Yeah, Indian
farmers committing suicide.

413
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,810
What's the story behind that?

414
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,560
So the best place to get information
on this comes from academic sources.

415
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:59,090
And if you look at Ronald Herring,
who is a professor at Cornell University,

416
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:01,130
he's looked at this question very much.

417
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,910
Suicide is a major issue in
India and it's very common.

418
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:09,440
And now more than ever among young women
and certainly is an issue among farmers.

419
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,690
Uh, they plant a very risky crop and
that's cotton. Cotton is a, is a,

420
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,380
uh, difficult to grow crop that in
most areas requires lots of water.

421
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,420
And if you don't get monsoonal rains, your
crop fails. So where this, uh, idea that,

422
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,350
uh, Monsanto crops where
somehow causing farmer suicides,

423
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,930
it comes from the idea that
the seeds are more expensive.

424
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,310
Farmers go into debt to some degree to
buy them, and then when the crop fails,

425
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,180
they lose the money.

426
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,980
It doesn't have anything to do with
Monsanto per se or with those particular

427
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:44,560
crops. The other big issue you have is
because these crops, so these are, um,

428
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,910
cotton plants that make
their own insecticide.

429
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,000
They make a protein completely
a benign to humans that, uh,

430
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,960
protects the plant against the,
uh,

431
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,050
against the weevils and other
critters that burrow into cotton.

432
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,640
And so farmers don't have
to spray pesticides and,

433
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,180
and it's a huge deal because it allows
them to farm with fewer without having

434
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:08,060
the cost of, they all want this. So
there were many of them want this,

435
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,770
they buy the seeds.
Now the problem is,

436
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:15,470
is there's a counterfeit seed market
where people are selling something that

437
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,300
isn't legit and there are the legitimate
problems with farmers who have,

438
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,370
who commit suicide
because of indebtedness.

439
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,220
But I don't know how much we can
directly blame that on the company or um,

440
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,230
or its agents.

441
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,010
So if someone buys a Monsanto cotton,

442
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:33,730
say the buy cotton seeds
and you grow cotton,

443
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:39,090
that farmer has to make an agreement to
not use that cotton to plant more cotton

444
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,950
that they have to buy more seeds.
Is that not the case?

445
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,960
So that's where it gets confusing with
people because they're like, well, why?

446
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:50,280
It's a natural process. It's a natural
process. If you buy that corn, I mean,

447
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,730
and you take that corn
and continue to grow corn,

448
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:57,180
that's always been how farmers have done
it throughout the beginning of time.

449
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,920
Now all of a sudden some company comes
along and says, no, we own that corn.

450
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,600
We license you that corn.

451
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,860
You grow the corn once and then you
have to continue to buy seeds from us to

452
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:08,694
grow corn.

453
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:13,770
That was never the case before in human
history is one company comes along and

454
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:14,610
demands that.

455
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,600
And that was connected to the suicides
of these people in India that this is a

456
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:19,980
totally new situation.

457
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,470
Actually. He very, very much
not a new situation. Um,

458
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:27,430
plant per plant variety protection and
protection of plant genetics has been

459
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:30,820
around since the 1930s.
And farmers as I mentioned before,

460
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:33,010
had been doing this
strictly by using hybrids,

461
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,980
which don't yield decent
plants in the next generation.

462
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,600
So you had the buy him from the company
every year more recently. And you,

463
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:41,590
if you wanted to,

464
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,680
let's say you bought an apple tree for
your apple or apple orchard from Cornell

465
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,750
University,
the one that Cornell University devised.

466
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,820
So we don't even talk about Monsanto.
Let's say a a public university. Uh,

467
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,070
the apple trees are all
propagated by vegetative cuttings.

468
00:27:57,071 --> 00:27:59,110
You cut off the little branch,
he grow roots on it,

469
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:04,111
grow new tree and you sign a
licensing agreement non GMO.

470
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,160
But there's things like
that, Straw strawberries from
University of California,

471
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,610
you sign a licensing agreement
and what does that entail? It,

472
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,980
it says that you will not propagate
those plant materials as a farmer,

473
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,370
that you'll use them to grow your
crop and that when you need more,

474
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:21,610
you'll buy more. And the reason,
and when did, when was this done?

475
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,130
All these have been done for,
for decades and,

476
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,850
and it's more and more upon the 70s,
the 80s. Like when, when was this built?

477
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:32,851
One of the started started back as long
as the 1930s but he wasn't really done

478
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:37,120
very often. You really started to see an
escalation of plant variety protection,

479
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,990
non Gmo plant variety protection,
um, in the last couple of decades.

480
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,100
So in the 1930s did they w let's say with
apples or something like that, someone,

481
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,810
someone figured out a way to selectively
breed a really excellent apple.

482
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,760
They protected those seeds
to the point of view,

483
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:54,610
bought seeds for those
apples and planted them.

484
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:57,760
You are not allowed to extract the seeds
from the apples that you planted and

485
00:28:57,761 --> 00:28:58,600
grow new seeds.

486
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,110
So la, but yeah, it's
sort of, you couldn't,

487
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:05,160
apples aren't apples are propagated by
the cuttings rather than seeds because

488
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:09,960
every seat is a genetic mess. Um, you
wouldn't, you can plant an apple eat,

489
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:11,700
buy an apple red delicious apple.

490
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,240
You can plant the 20 seeds inside and
you're going to get 20 plants that are

491
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:18,300
nothing alike and none of them will
have decent fruit. None of them.

492
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,030
The ones that have the,
the blockbuster traits,

493
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:23,490
and this is why there
has to be protection. Uh,

494
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,240
for us at University of Florida to grow a,

495
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,250
a new orange variety might take 30 years.

496
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,640
It might take a acres and acres that
costs the university hundreds of thousands

497
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,450
of dollars a year to borrow or to
lease. Uh, the pest treatments,

498
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,860
the fertilizer, the water, the labor,

499
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,020
it costs hundreds of thousands,

500
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:48,760
maybe a million dollars to bring that
new variety to market and to have to just

501
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:52,060
give it away is it ends
a breeding program.

502
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,870
So it wouldn't the solution be to publicly
fund the research so that the people

503
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:00,460
benefit from it.

504
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:05,350
So instead of a large corporation being
able to lock down this perfect orange

505
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:08,200
that you've developed at the
University of Florida instead,

506
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,530
the taxpayer's dollars,
which goes towards the research,

507
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,240
creates this beautiful plant that
everyone is allowed to benefit from. Well,

508
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:20,030
that's what happens. What happens is
that the public good or the, or you know,

509
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,890
public research, publicly funded says
you get a little dribble of dollars.

510
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,670
But our,

511
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,350
our breeding programs are very much self
sustaining in many cases that you need

512
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:32,440
to commercialize your best selections,

513
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:35,920
are your best fruit in order to be able
to keep the breeding program going.

514
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,330
So the university has to generate money
through its breeding program and then it

515
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:45,331
has to protect that money to ensure that
they will continue to receive money,

516
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,280
uh, from all the different things
they developed in their lab,

517
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:51,620
which will justify the amount of money
that you spend on your research. And,

518
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,600
and it's not much,

519
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:57,010
I mean we get a tiny bit that comes
back in terms of individual, you know,

520
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:58,630
the percentage,
it's not much at all,

521
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,990
but most of it goes to the breeding
programs that allow them to continue to be

522
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:08,620
leading breeding programs and hire people
and leased land and produce the next

523
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:10,030
varieties for the public.

524
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,050
And the only way to do that as to make
sure that people don't take your orange

525
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,480
and take the seeds and plant new oranges.

526
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,600
And cause if people do illegally
propagate this and compete against the

527
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,640
nurseries that are doing it
legally and selling at the farmers,

528
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:27,650
you have a couple of problems.
One is you lose control of the,

529
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,770
the product quality. Is it really true
to type what people say it is? Um,

530
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,410
and farm,
the really the beneficiary is the farmer.

531
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,910
We make something that the farmer and
wants and that the farmer is desperate for

532
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,090
our farmers need.
And we have a,

533
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,980
an orange problem right now
in Florida that's coming here.

534
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,290
We have 60 million citrus trees that are
dying and we're doing everything we can

535
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,040
to identify resistant
material. Not Gmo, but uh,

536
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:58,120
something called citrus greening disease.
Huanglongbing it's a disease.

537
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:02,400
That's a dude. Yeah. Yeah. Seattle
is Bruce Lee movie jail. Uh,

538
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,530
he was uh, the um, uh, citrus
greening disease is a disease of,

539
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:11,080
or the bacteria were bacterium blocks
the vasculature of the orange tree and

540
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:13,820
it's spread from tree to tree with
something called a [inaudible].

541
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,950
It's an insect and there's Jillions of
them and this thing bites one infected

542
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:22,540
tree goes to another and now spreads
that bacterium that can live in that tree

543
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,910
for five years before
there's any symptoms.

544
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,260
And then the tree just gets
sick and starts to die. Um,

545
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,800
we've got an orange industry that is half
as big as it used to be and we need a

546
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:36,780
solution. And that's why
we're, um, and so if our,

547
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:39,960
it's our breeders are making
everything they can to, to

548
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,820
generate new trees, uh, accelerating
the process, everything they can.

549
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:47,600
And if they can get that new tree
after they spent millions of dollars,

550
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,750
some of them from the Usda
to identify a solution,

551
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,560
there has to be a way for some of that
funding to come back to the program to

552
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:58,970
invent the next generation so that now
we're ready when the next threat comes.

553
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,860
So what would be the solution like say
if you have some sort of a bacteria

554
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:07,130
that's infecting these,
these plants and killing these oranges,

555
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,710
what could be a potential
solution to that?

556
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:13,130
And will it be the ramifications of you
didn't come up with a solution? Yeah,

557
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:13,441
so the,

558
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:17,630
the cool part about this is that being
where I am at the university and I'm the

559
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:21,310
chairman of a department
that does everything from
organic and sustainable, uh,

560
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,690
biology all the way through space biology.

561
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,890
You see people attacking this from so
many ways. We're changing the plants,

562
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:30,350
nutrition or changing just the root stock.

563
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:35,060
So I'm citrus trees are a bunch of routes
in us in a science. You Glue together,

564
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:38,500
you graft them together,
talk about a Frankenfood. Um,

565
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,010
we're building root stocks
that can generate resistance
to the bacterium so that

566
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:46,820
now when you graft on a scion,
maybe it will be resistant. Um,

567
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,010
we're doing everything
from insect control.

568
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,970
We're doing everything from a
essential oil treatments, uh,

569
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,800
novel drugs that are used in humans and
approved for humans being applied to see

570
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:01,530
if they can kill the psyllid ordered an
antibiotic or something like, well, um,

571
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,780
it's hard to do antibiotics because of
the resistance factor that people are

572
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:09,980
resistant to using antibiotics or on
trees because they're afraid they'll get.

573
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,080
So this is why this is the defensive,

574
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,790
weird science environment that we have
to work in as public scientists were

575
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:20,840
trying identify compounds that are
approved for use in humans or approved for

576
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:24,530
use on food that might have a shot at it.
And we're trying everything.

577
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,750
The one thing, some of the things that
have worked very well, our GMO solutions.

578
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:35,120
And so as a company in Florida that is
looking to commercialize a spinach gene

579
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,060
in orange that solves the problem,

580
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,350
we have a couple of them at the University
of Florida for at our Lake Alfred

581
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:47,351
facility where there are
genes that directly affect
the bacterial growth and uh,

582
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,690
they work well and they're
not harmful to humans.

583
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,230
And the trees are now five
years old with no symptoms.

584
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,790
So here's an example of a GMO solution.
It's not Monsanto.

585
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,990
We can't solve this problem with
breeding, uh, not easily anyway.

586
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,520
And here's something that
we can solve this. In five
years, thousands of families,

587
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,420
thousands of Florida families, thousands
of California families are watching.

588
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:14,780
They're watching their groves,
waiting for the yellow symptoms to appear.

589
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,640
And we have solutions,

590
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,720
but people will fight us tooth
and nail from applying them.

591
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,820
And that's where I's a public scientists.

592
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:27,080
That's why I want to be here to talk
to you because I'm looking to appeal to

593
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:31,700
people's intellect to divorce
the technology from Monsanto,

594
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,240
divorced this technology that
that you have in the public sector

595
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,010
that can be used to solve public problems
that are important. So there's a,

596
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,510
there's a tremendous amount of fear
that's attached to the subjects.

597
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,130
And with that fear there's
often very little investigation,
which is unfortunate,

598
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:54,180
but it's also very rare to get a person
like you to sit down and talk to them

599
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:56,070
and explain this and it takes a long time.

600
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,940
And so I really appreciate you
being here for this, but there's,

601
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,380
there's a lot of fears that people have
that are founded in fact and founded in

602
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,720
actual consequences like mercy. You
know what, Marissa come from it.

603
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:13,320
It's a medication resistant strain of
this horrible staph infection that people

604
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:17,660
get, but it's staff. I've had staff,
it's horrible, it's nasty. And the,

605
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:22,590
the antibiotics, he take a ruthless and
they leave you like a Zombie. The DF.

606
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,530
I had a headache. I felt terrible. I
mean, it was like, it was really weak.

607
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:29,710
I could barely open up a jar of
pickles, you know, the feeling, the,

608
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,650
the medication has created a
resistance to this medication.

609
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,140
Bacteria that have survived the result,

610
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,320
the medication and have grown
stronger because of that.

611
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:42,840
And that is a fear that
people were worried about,

612
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:47,841
that there's a balanced in nature and
that when you screw around with that

613
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:48,841
balance,

614
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:53,080
there's unintended consequences and
oftentimes they can be deadly like Mercer.

615
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,570
And this is something that I think
people are, I mean, it makes,

616
00:36:57,571 --> 00:37:02,190
it gives them cause to worry about
someone putting antibiotics in their food,

617
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:04,980
whether it's in their chickens
or whether it's in there,

618
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:07,620
which they've started
to do less and less of.

619
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:10,960
And I think it was Tyson
foods that, um, uh,

620
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,180
publicly stated that they were going
to significantly decrease their use of

621
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:18,510
antibiotics and try to cut it out
entirely because of public concern.

622
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,190
I think it was Tyson foods. See if that's
true. Um, but this is a real concern,

623
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,620
right? I mean, doesn't that make sense?
That people were worried about that? Well,

624
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,170
absolutely. I think, and I'm
not so worried about the,

625
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:31,860
that the meat industry in antibiotics,
like that doesn't phase me too much,

626
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,910
but the idea of Murcia
okay. And all of our, uh,

627
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,780
resistant bacterial strains that comes
because of an overuse of a silver bullet

628
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:43,500
technology. These things come
about because the mom has a,

629
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:46,080
a screaming kid who says he
must have an ear infection.

630
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:51,060
So I'm in a demand from my doctor that I
can get antibiotics. Um, it comes from,

631
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,170
uh, you know, those of us saying
not taking them correctly, you know,

632
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:58,200
taking them for a few days and then
not taking the whole bottle as we're

633
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:01,980
supposed to bill. See, I've been told
recently that that's not the case.

634
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,330
That that was what they had discussed.

635
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,760
They had believed that for
a certain amount of time,

636
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,810
but now they no longer believe that
it's necessary to take a full, uh,

637
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,090
that doesn't do anything bad to create a,
uh,

638
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,920
or to take a shorter dose of it. Okay.
I don't know the literature on that,

639
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,390
so I'll have to kind of get back to you.
So much science I tried to shoot from,

640
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:25,150
you know, the stuff I'm really solid
on, but the, the long story short is,

641
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:28,200
is that in, it came up a lot
online. If we can segue into that.

642
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,760
They talk in the Twitter feed before we
talk a lot of concerns about the super

643
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:36,100
weeds issue.
And it's the same idea that because

644
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,160
the roundup resistant technology has
been so successful for farmers that it's

645
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:43,420
what they overuse or they constantly use.

646
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,250
Now you see resistant weeds that invade
those fields that are resistant to the,

647
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:51,130
to the compound just like in Murcia.
Um,

648
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,920
and it's from using a
silver bullet technology.

649
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,080
The reason that that's a
problem is because the process
to come up with the next

650
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:00,000
generation of,

651
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,060
of solution is so arduous and so expensive
that we stick with the old technology

652
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:06,820
and we can't come up with something new

653
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,330
fast enough.
So the silver bullet technology,

654
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:12,580
this antibiotic that we've created
to deal with very specific infection

655
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,650
infections, it works. It's very
effective. So people use too much of it.

656
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:17,640
And because of that,

657
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:22,641
then it creates this medication resistant
strain of this and there's not enough

658
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:26,340
research done to fight off that medication
resistant strain of it because it's

659
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:31,140
so cost prohibitive to do the,
the work to create a medical,

660
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:32,820
a solution in the first place.

661
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,060
I think you're right.
And I think because the main issue,

662
00:39:35,061 --> 00:39:39,710
remember go back to this idea that DNA
has natural mutation and natural problems

663
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:43,010
in this replication that give
new information in a cell.

664
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,080
And when you get that Murcia infection,

665
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:49,040
those cells are dividing every 20
minutes and you have millions of them.

666
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:54,190
And so the chance of one gaining the
ability to metabolize your antibiotics is

667
00:39:54,231 --> 00:39:55,220
actually pretty good.

668
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:59,030
And when you're talking about billions
of cells over many generations,

669
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:00,350
that's where these things come from.

670
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,610
It's kind of funny because actually I
have an appointment on Wednesday morning

671
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,260
because something out of my lab,

672
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:10,700
I have something that looks like it
would be a potential ability to make the

673
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:14,510
next generation of mercy. We're
actually going to test it on Murcia. Um,

674
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:19,040
and something that I came up with plants
that that work process we're patenting

675
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:23,090
that makes new compounds that could be
very helpful against other creatures

676
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:24,380
outside of plants.

677
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,640
Okay. One of the things that
troubles people the most about,

678
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,280
um,
genetically modified things,

679
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,940
whether it's foods or whether it's animals
or anything that were messing around

680
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:39,960
with is the potential health risks
for the people that consume them.

681
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,200
That is a, the biggest problem.
Probably the biggest concern.

682
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,080
People were worried about cancer and
I've seen people tweet this at you.

683
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,830
You're a scientist but you're not an
oncologist. You're not a cancer expert.

684
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:52,170
You're not dealing with people
that get sick from certain things.

685
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,450
What evidence if any, is
there that medication? Uh,

686
00:40:57,451 --> 00:41:01,860
or rather that I'm genetically modified
foods cause diseases in people cause

687
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:03,660
sickness and people. Yeah.
So this is the, is the

688
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,700
big issue. Let's start,
let's look at that backwards.

689
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,170
We've been growing these things in
eating them now for 18 years and studying

690
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:14,340
them a lot longer. 30 in terms of feeding
them to animals and everything else.

691
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,990
There has not been one case of one single
health effect that's been attributed

692
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:22,800
to this. Um, so it looks
like it's, I mean, in my
perspective, this has got to be,

693
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,480
these are some of the safest products
in the history of humans. Um,

694
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,890
and so we haven't seen anything
come out on the other side of this.

695
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:35,030
These are some of the most
tested crops in the world.

696
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,620
They start on the drawing board.

697
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:42,070
When you say you're going to take a
gene that from bacillus thuringiensis bt

698
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:44,450
gene, um, the thing that we use in,

699
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,180
it's actually called cry one a or whatever
it's called cry is the acronym. We,

700
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:51,500
we'll get into details.
You take this gene from the bacteria,

701
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,010
a bacterium that's used to
protect organic produce.

702
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,800
It works fine there and you take
that gene, which encodes the protein.

703
00:41:57,801 --> 00:42:01,700
So it's the information from the cell
that allows the cell to create this

704
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:05,440
protein that targets the gut
of a lepidopteran insects.

705
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,570
So the Caterpillar of, of certain
birds, I'm sorry, not birds,

706
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:12,740
butterflies and moths. And uh,
now the plant makes this protein.

707
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,960
You can do the tests in vitro. You can
say, does this protein affects cells?

708
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,360
Does this protein effect animals?
When you feed it,

709
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,600
does it affect animals that you
feed in a tremendously high levels?

710
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,430
All those tests are done ad nauseum
and this is a natural protein that's

711
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:30,500
digested just like any other protein.

712
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,100
So is there any risk

713
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:39,060
at all of messing with food and
introducing antibiotics in food,

714
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:43,730
whether it's in the tree of uh, orange,
uh, and the, the, you know, is it,

715
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:47,100
is there any risk for
humans that consume that?

716
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,070
Absolutely. Absolutely. So
I have to answer it like a
scientist. Okay. All right.

717
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:55,540
You should, you can never say there's
no risk. And what we have to say is,

718
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,450
is that there's risk in
anything we do with genetics,

719
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,900
but we live in a time where we have
this unbelievable sensitivity to detect

720
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,230
something in a plant. We can look at
the metabolites that are, we can change.

721
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,700
Take a plant as it is,

722
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:14,080
add a gene and see what changes
with unbelievable resolution.

723
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,370
We can look at every single
protein. We can look at, uh,

724
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,260
every single gene that's
turned on or turned off.

725
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,290
We can look at where the gene
that's added is integrated.

726
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,400
We can understand metabolite profiles
are screened for specific carcinogens.

727
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:32,500
It is so easy right now to be able to
do a very careful assessment. You know,

728
00:43:32,501 --> 00:43:35,650
I'm not in this ballgame to hurt people
and farmers aren't either. I mean,

729
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:39,600
they're there. They want to produce
wholesome food for people. Um,

730
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,790
my job as a public scientist is to use,
you know,

731
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,140
my ability to dream and think of ideas
and solutions for public benefit.

732
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,670
You've got tens of thousands
of me out there. Uh,

733
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,850
the person who found something wrong
would win a Nobel prize for it.

734
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,740
It's that much of a big deal.
If there was something wrong,

735
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,340
but to play devil's advocate,
sure.

736
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:06,170
If there was some sort of a reaction
and 1% of the people are less than what,

737
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:11,030
let's say one 10th of 1% of the people
that was deadly, but the company,

738
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,130
whether it's the big M or you know,

739
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:17,570
some other company is making
$1 billion a year off of this,

740
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,600
there would be a tremendous amount of
pressure to continue that money flowing.

741
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,140
Whether it's through,
I'm not saying it's through scientists.

742
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:27,170
I certainly wouldn't think it
would be through people like you,

743
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,190
but I would think that somewhere locked
away in some office high and a gun

744
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,190
turret is some evil asshole who owns a
giant steak of the corporation and he

745
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:42,000
says like, let them die if they eat
our colo care. It's not about money.

746
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,620
There's there's that.
That's the thought.

747
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:46,770
That's the big worry is that they
would hide it. Like you know,

748
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:50,760
the story of GM and the ignorant shit
condition switches. A great example.

749
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:55,440
They hid the fact that their ignition
switches were faulty and people died and

750
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:59,970
now they're being sued and it's horrible.
AndW th that's GM.

751
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:03,960
I mean they made the corvette, they
made the Bel Air. I mean this is,

752
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,710
how is this possible that people
that make Cadillac would be evil?

753
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:12,450
The first two letters of GMO?
No. Right. That's the conspiracy.

754
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,330
There's also GMT, which
is just a time. Yeah. Oh,

755
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,830
but the big deal is I, I,
and I, I agree with you.

756
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:21,330
Like when you start talking about money,

757
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,460
you can look at many
examples throughout history.

758
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,770
Whether you're talking cigarettes,
you're talking, you know,

759
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,700
where you see examples where money
has bought influence and sure.

760
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:34,730
But the beautiful part of this is that
science always wins and that you do find

761
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:36,420
out the truth comes out eventually.

762
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,200
And for these companies that are
producing these products, in my opinion,

763
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,460
and I'm not with these companies,

764
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:45,570
I can't tell you how they think they
stand to make a lot more money by making a

765
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:49,110
product that's thoroughly tested and
being clean with anything they would find

766
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:50,670
that would be problematic.

767
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:55,260
The other thing that's really
important here is that we know,

768
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,090
so when you say you're going to move,
let's say, uh, now we're gonna move,

769
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,760
talk about rice that you can
add a jeans too to make it, uh,

770
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,970
have high Beta carotene content, higher
vitamin eight, kg of golden rice and rice.

771
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,190
You know what those genes do
cause we studied them and carrots,

772
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,140
we understand the products they produce.

773
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,900
So there's a plausibility
aspect to this too,

774
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,650
that when we take this from carrot and put
it in rice, what's the difference? Now,

775
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,560
maybe there are some differences
and we can test for those,

776
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,470
but it starts out with the plausibility.

777
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:29,130
This isn't magic and Voodoo and
weird back room. My, you know, let's,

778
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,600
let's see what this lever does.

779
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:35,130
So the idea is that if you eat
carrots and rice together as food,

780
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:40,310
that's not much different than splicing
carrots and rice together and likely if

781
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,270
you're not allergic to
either one of those things,

782
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:44,950
you're not going to be allergic to this
rice though. You create. Absolutely.

783
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,590
And even if you are allergic to carrots,

784
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,910
taking one gene out of it that doesn't
have a immunological footprint.

785
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:53,970
And then on a antigenic
footprint in, in humans, uh,

786
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,880
like the jeans associate with Beta
carotene production don't have,

787
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,510
you'd be able to move those into rice
and have no problem. That's a good point.

788
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:05,160
The, the point of allergic,
because biodiversity is, is,

789
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:08,490
is a huge issue when you're
talking about foods in general,

790
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,460
that some people have
extremely different reactions,

791
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:15,900
whether it's to peanuts or to shellfish
or to a variety of things that most of

792
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:16,740
us enjoy.

793
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,950
But there's a few people that have severe
reactions is very same thing and this

794
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:25,830
is natural, completely,
totally natural. Um,

795
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,920
this is the question when it
comes to certain types of,

796
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,260
if you're dealing with these outliers,

797
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:37,380
if you're dealing with this one 10th
of 1% of the population where this,

798
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,680
this chemical reaction happens inside
their body, completely natural.

799
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,280
Um, we, should we stop
the production of peanuts?

800
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,120
Should we stop the production
of shellfish? I say, fuck no,

801
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,890
I love peanuts and I love shrimp.

802
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:56,020
But if you're dealing with a medication
that does the exact same thing and

803
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:59,680
reacts with the bio diversity of the exact
same percentage of the population and

804
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,850
could potentially be fatal like
shellfish, Ken, like peanuts can be fatal.

805
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,900
People have died from them. Um, what
do we do about that? Yeah, and this is,

806
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:11,020
this is actually the dilemma,
right? Well, it is, but it in a way,

807
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:15,520
it's a dilemma that this kind of
trenchgenic or GMO technology can solve.

808
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,110
Um,

809
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,900
what's really interesting about that is
we know what the food allergen proteins

810
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:24,830
are very well. Uh, you know that the
protein and peanuts, the proteins and soy,

811
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,060
the proteins in wheat that cause, um, uh,

812
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:33,340
that cause allergies and you can
turn those off and make them go away.

813
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,100
I'm using transgenic
technology and it's been done.

814
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,560
We have allergy free peanuts in the lab.

815
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,100
So there's peanuts that people have
commercially available. No, no,

816
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:45,820
because people are afraid of this
stuff. This is what kills me. Oh,

817
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,680
here we are making solutions.
We have,

818
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:51,550
there's wheat that still makes decent
bread where the gluten and Gilad or the

819
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:55,820
glutens are the gladden and the other
one lieutenant had been shut off. Um,

820
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,190
it still makes decent bread.

821
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,220
You'd have soy that you can
decreased specific allergens.

822
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,780
We know what the allergens are in food
and can turn them off and sometimes it

823
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:07,980
makes the plant a little different
or makes the product that, you know,

824
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:10,150
like the wheat when you
take out the major glutens,

825
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:11,650
it could change the bread structure,

826
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,480
but it still seems that the other ones
kind of ramp up to, to compensate.

827
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,640
So we can make a better product
using this technology. But we exist.

828
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,040
I mean, these things exist. Show
they're not, they're not, uh,

829
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,690
some wild fantasy of the future.

830
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,810
It's just that they would never be
deregulated because of the costs.

831
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:32,350
And because the industry is associated
with them, the peanut industry says,

832
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,130
no way.

833
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:37,240
We don't want people boycotting peanut
butter just so just have a few kids,

834
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,270
you know, have problems with
the allergy instead. To me,

835
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:42,670
that's a total injustice
that drives me crazy.

836
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,300
So you feel like this could
all be eradicated. Um,

837
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,490
but in nature,

838
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:52,570
these things are radicating and in a much
more disturbing way and nature of the

839
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:55,540
people that are allergic to peanuts
eat them and die and it's no longer

840
00:49:55,541 --> 00:50:00,400
expressed in, in the genetics. That's,
that's the natural method of doing it.

841
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:05,710
The, the concern with any of these Jamal
genetic modifications to the lay person,

842
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,170
which I am most certainly lay,
um,

843
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,880
is that you are creating
something that shouldn't be there,

844
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,790
but you are creating something and you
don't want the consequences of this.

845
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:18,070
Like the wings of the butterfly and
the create the hurricane. You know,

846
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,320
that stupid fucking,
that shit drives me crazy.

847
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,700
That's not how goddamn hurricane
is made. Assholes. Water flies.

848
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:29,060
Don't make hurricanes. Shut
the fuck up. No, no, no. It's
a chain of events. It's no,

849
00:50:29,061 --> 00:50:32,300
it's not. No. It's fucking weather
system. It has to do with the planet.

850
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,980
It has to do with the atmosphere.

851
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:36,560
It has to do with magnetics and
us do a lot of different shit.

852
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:40,310
It doesn't have to do with butterflies.
And See, that's exactly it.

853
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,380
We can sit around all day and talk about,
well,

854
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:46,010
what are the unintended consequences? And
you get this all the time. What are the,

855
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,180
what if? What if? What if,

856
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,830
and I can tell you that today on June 4th,
2015,

857
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:54,980
20,000 people are going to die
because of insufficient nutrition.

858
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,040
That's a problem that
I can tell you exists.

859
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,640
I can tell you that kids will have
allergic reactions to peanuts. Here.

860
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,780
I can tell you that there are 60 million,
uh,

861
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,970
citrus trees dying and these are
problems Monsanto is going to fix.

862
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:10,610
These are problems that I need to fix,
that guys like me,

863
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:12,050
people like me need to fix.

864
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,920
And we're being handcuffed by an
irrational fear of a good technology.

865
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:20,030
And do you think that this irrational
fear of a good technology comes about

866
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:23,370
because of what they consider
to be a greedy corporation?

867
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:27,590
So there's fear of greedy corporations
because we, like we talked about with GM,

868
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:28,910
I mean we could talk about,

869
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,550
we could talk about other
corporations that have moved into, uh,

870
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,600
countries that are poverty stricken
and taken over and abused their natural

871
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:41,990
environment.
And that we associate money with WWE,

872
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,880
especially corporate entities with this
idea of constantly needed to make more

873
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:51,881
money every year to justify what
they're doing to their shareholders.

874
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:56,270
I mean, this is the reality
of these businesses, these
infinite growth businesses.

875
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,460
And we associate them with callousness.

876
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,450
We associate them with not caring about
the people who work for them or the

877
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:06,200
people that they affect in the
environments that they build their plants.

878
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,410
And this is one of the main
concerns that people have,

879
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,130
is the diffusion of responsibility
that comes with being a part,

880
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:18,131
a single piece of a large entity that
has ultimately doing at least some bad,

881
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,690
right. No, I understand that. You know,

882
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:23,990
and as in the old punk rock guy and he
says that your, wait a minute, hold on.

883
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,840
Slow on. You were an old punk rock
guy. Yeah, I played in a, yeah,

884
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:31,180
I played the guitar for insane war
tomatoes for a, for awhile. Yeah.

885
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,910
Insane Ward tomatoes did send me,
sent me a little insane more tomatoes.

886
00:52:34,911 --> 00:52:39,560
How did it go? Like, oh well our best ones
were called Iraq. You suck a rock. Yeah,

887
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:43,970
we had a, we did Tom called spirit
of Elvis where a giant dancing dead.

888
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:48,140
Elvis would come out on stage. And
uh, and uh, did you get the name? Uh,

889
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,960
I don't know. I know it
was, it was a, there was we,

890
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:55,930
while we were called dangling units, but
then someone already had that. So it was,

891
00:52:55,931 --> 00:52:59,000
it's kind of spinal tap.
So we were in saint [inaudible] tomatoes.

892
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:03,380
We were the coolest band that no one
ever knew of. Fucking video. No. El Yeah,

893
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,670
there you go. High Rock. You
suck. Oh, that's just longer.

894
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:08,600
So in this you'll sure that's,
I live in an asshole.

895
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,720
I like how you didn't say the word
cause you're respectable now. Well,

896
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:16,040
I am a professor. I know. This'll
do. What did you do in this band?

897
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,240
I played guitar for maybe the first few
years and then switched over to bass.

898
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,880
Did you sing it all?
Uh,

899
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,980
I think you can hear me up right here.

900
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,300
I do.
I have a little thing here

901
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,040
coming up in a second here.

902
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,200
Kind of Motorhead he before. Well,
not bad. This is good workout music.

903
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:44,810
This is me here
where you jumped in there and then here.

904
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,390
That's you. Yeah, that was
me. What year was this?

905
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:59,280
No, this was a 1989 maybe 88 how old
were you back then? Uh, I don't know.

906
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,160
22 I was 20. 22 how old are
you now? 48 yeah. So we,

907
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,470
and we played all over the place.
We did a lot in, uh, in Wisconsin.

908
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:11,020
We were real big and we had
the costumes we had. I'm like,

909
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,810
I had a Gene Simmons outfit that I wore
with gigantic high shoes and the guy who

910
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:20,010
was the singer dressed as a tomato and
lit himself on fire and it was before

911
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:24,300
great white, um, wow. Uh, all
homemade gas pyrotechnic show,

912
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,370
she was fantastic. And the eight
people that came to see us loved it.

913
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,070
You got eight,
we've got eight and they were all put in.

914
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,690
The best part was we would pound our
audience with uh, produce at the end.

915
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:41,580
We throw tomatoes at him. Will you will
involve in, in agriculture back then?

916
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,540
Um, not really. I was, I see. I
haven't even been until very recently.

917
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:46,890
I was a basic scientist.

918
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:50,580
I studied the nuts and bolts of DNA
and nuts and bolts of plant physiology.

919
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,150
And um, but at this time,
if you're 22 back then,

920
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,330
you presumably had gone to
college already. And were
you studying agriculturally?

921
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:01,500
What was the connection to tomatoes and
people throwing vegetables at you? Oh,

922
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:03,360
it was that just luck?
No,

923
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:07,800
just coincidentally it was cheaper than
throwing jars of pickles was and, and uh,

924
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,430
but you know what I'm saying?
Produce was involved in your,

925
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:14,750
even in your punk rock. So we've
gone full circle. Yeah. It's odd.

926
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,080
I didn't have an egg. That's
a coincidence. More than,
because it's a funny one,

927
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:22,080
isn't it? That's a good thing. I didn't
want to study reproductive physiology,

928
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:24,380
I guess, you know, throw ovaries at the,

929
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,020
but we'd be the best thing that could
throw, I would think. Dick's. Yeah,

930
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:36,070
but, but going back to answer your
question, but, so, so the guy in me who,

931
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,720
who doesn't, who hates his cable
company, who hates his, you know,

932
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:42,090
the people who sell them
gas, all that stuff. Um,

933
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,130
I look at companies like Monsanto and
others as being the way that farmers who

934
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:50,730
are my real clients are enabled. And, uh,

935
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,370
so whether or not I like who
they're buying it from, there,

936
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:56,280
the folks who are the ultimate
beneficiaries of the technology.

937
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,010
And the other thing that's really, um, uh,

938
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,150
and so the other exciting thing for
me is when the small companies can use

939
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,690
something like GMO technology
to gain a unique market niche,

940
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,940
like a Oakenoggen specialty fruits.

941
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,480
They make this apple that doesn't turn
Brown when you cut it and they have four

942
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:16,010
full time employees. Are they
from Oregon? They're from um,

943
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,630
Washington State Canada. Is that, what
is Oakenoggen mean? Does that, uh,

944
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:24,130
a location or an Indian word?
Yeah, I think it's both. I think

945
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,470
it's uh, but they, um, they grow,

946
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,250
they have this apple that when you cut
it doesn't Brown, which is a great trait.

947
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,720
It uses an apple gene to turn off
an apple gene and a, in other words,

948
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:38,890
the GMO modification puts this gene
in backwards so it shuts off the,

949
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:43,810
in the innate con, uh, construct
DNA a gene. It turns off that gene.

950
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:45,850
And then, uh, the apple
doesn't Brown when you cut it,

951
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:50,710
which is a great trait if you want to
have apples and process products or apples

952
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:55,540
as, you know, sliced apples in bags or
whatever. Uh, four full time employees.

953
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:00,310
So my whole thing is go ahead and hit
your Monsanto march against him, whatever.

954
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:01,144
I don't care.

955
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:05,140
But do you realize that when you dress
like a B and lay on the ground and go

956
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:08,920
into convulsions and say that
this is biotechnology that's bad,

957
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,950
that now you're affecting the
people who would buy that apple,

958
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:14,650
the people who I would come
up with a solution for,

959
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:19,540
for the the people who need bananas and
Uganda or the people who eat rice and

960
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:23,920
southeast Asia that needed more
nutritious rice that by mixing together

961
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:28,120
biotechnology and agriculture and
conflating that with companies and things

962
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:29,590
companies did or didn't do,

963
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:34,750
you automatically take technology out
of the hands of the people who in the

964
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,800
people in the solutions that we care
about how things like the environment,

965
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,370
things like farmers, things like
the needy. We have those solutions.

966
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:48,190
And that's the thing that just by the, by
the Monsanto phobia is dangerous. Well,

967
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:52,990
I think a good part of what the problem
is, it can be attributed to the,

968
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:56,830
the idea of people not being responsible
for actions because they're part of a

969
00:57:56,831 --> 00:57:59,740
collective group being concur.
Completely unnatural.

970
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,930
And I think that if people had actual PR,

971
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,460
if the idea of a corporation was,
uh,

972
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:11,970
was not that that corporation would
be immune to the actual people being

973
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:15,940
involved in that corporation wouldn't be
immune to responsibility for everything

974
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:19,480
that the corporation does. And it's one
of the reasons why businesses get an LLC,

975
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:22,020
right? Uh, limited,
whatever it is, corporation,

976
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:25,510
the idea is to protect you somehow
or another creates some sort of legal

977
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,490
definition of you that's different
than you outside of a corporation,

978
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:35,140
which is weird. You know,
it's like people, you're,
you're a fucking dude. Okay?

979
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:38,710
If you're a dude, if you call yourself
Kevin Folta Llc, I'm still talking to you,

980
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:40,630
man. You're right here you
sit. You're the same guy.

981
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:44,020
But if you do something under
the guise of your corporation,

982
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,740
there's a completely different legal
ramification than if you do something on

983
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:49,720
your own, like bankruptcy,
things on those lines.

984
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:53,710
You're not as responsible for debts.
I think that might be the problem though.

985
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:55,180
The problem might be like,

986
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,770
I know that you're a decent person and a
nice person and I know that what you're

987
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:02,920
trying to do is noble and just and
true and in the vein of science,

988
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:04,870
I I 100% believe that.

989
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:10,380
I think that what people worried about
is when someone like you gets to working

990
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,640
for some big giant group.

991
00:59:12,641 --> 00:59:15,640
This is why people keep saying that
you're some sort of a shell or that other

992
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:17,380
foot,
let's say take you out of the equation,

993
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,270
but other folks that are working for
Monsanto, they're doing and they're money,

994
00:59:21,271 --> 00:59:24,830
but the corporations give a fuck about
people. That's what we have to stop.

995
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:29,330
We have to stop this idea that a bunch
of people together collectively can do

996
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:34,331
something that's really unethical and
they can do it and ruined in natural

997
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:37,400
environments and not be
responsible like the BP oil spill.

998
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,940
I mean everybody knows there was all
kinds of fuckery and shenanigans that went

999
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:44,750
on to protect the people that were
involved from that BP oil scandal.

1000
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,900
Those people that had been profiting in
insane sacrilegious amounts of money for

1001
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:51,620
a long period of time.

1002
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:55,400
When it came time to pony up that money
and clean that fucking mess up, boy,

1003
00:59:55,401 --> 00:59:56,810
did things get weird?
You know,

1004
00:59:56,811 --> 01:00:00,470
boy did things get legal and complicated
and people were giving nondisclosures

1005
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:04,010
to sign to make exorbitant monies for
clean up and people were paid off and

1006
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:06,170
there was a lot of fuckery involved.

1007
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:10,910
That is what people worry about when
it comes to genetically modified foods.

1008
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,890
What we're worried about is the,

1009
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:17,540
the method of action that
corporations have been proven to take.

1010
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,320
That is to protect the
corporation as a it, as a unit,

1011
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:26,030
and to do so an act collectively in
a way that you would never act as an

1012
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:27,880
individual. No, I agree Joe.

1013
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,240
But I guarantee you that 90% of the
people that went to march against Monsanto

1014
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:36,800
drove a car that used oil that may,
it came out of a BP. Well, sure.

1015
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:40,190
And so here's an example though. You
know, go ahead. Hate a corporation,

1016
01:00:40,191 --> 01:00:44,540
but they're still using the products
and uh, and no one's trying to shut off.

1017
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,750
No one's going to the gas station and
knocking the pump out of my hand when I

1018
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:48,980
would go to stick it in my car.

1019
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,850
Yet there are people who would feel very
comfortable depriving farmers have the

1020
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:57,350
right to buy the seeds that they
choose. And so for, to me, again,

1021
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:02,330
if there's a social business issue
here that needs to be remedied,

1022
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:05,840
there's gotta be another mechanism to do
that. And I'm fine with that. Go ahead.

1023
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:10,240
Hate any company you want. All I'm
saying is, let's not talk about that.

1024
01:01:10,241 --> 01:01:13,820
It's not put out the, the bullshit
that says that Gmos caused cancer.

1025
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:17,060
Gmos are causing autism. That the uh, uh,

1026
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:21,410
the herbicides associated with it are
cause autism. All of that is crazy talk.

1027
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,890
That takes us out of our
problem solving mode.

1028
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:27,860
It distracts from what the good
things that we can do with technology.

1029
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,520
What is collective evolution.com?
Is that a,

1030
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,590
is that a reputable website? Not so
much there, there one that has a, they,

1031
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:39,030
they're also one that isn't
really, uh, excited about, uh,

1032
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:42,780
biotechnology and other corporate
stuff. I mean like nation, a change.

1033
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:47,660
There's a whole bunch of them and I read
those things and I would say 50 to 60%

1034
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:51,210
of the stuff. I'm right there with Ya.
You know, I'm a politically a lefty.

1035
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:55,880
I'm a American college professor. You
know, I, um, I love seeing social justice.

1036
01:01:55,881 --> 01:01:59,260
I love seeing a social progress.
I love those kinds of,

1037
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:00,710
I mean it's stuff that I fight for,

1038
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,340
but these are examples where I see the
technology that can actually enhance

1039
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:10,100
those things and that we can wrestle
it away from the big corporations if we

1040
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:14,600
only stopped making a fabricating
information about them. Yeah.

1041
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:17,210
Well obviously this doesn't have anything
to do with social justice or anything.

1042
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,310
Um, but there, there's this study linking

1043
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:25,290
Gmos to cancer, liver, kidney damage
and severe hormonal disruption,

1044
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,630
disruption in rats. Right? Uh,

1045
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:30,850
that was one of the collective evolution
had written a story about, well,

1046
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,450
they covered it just like
everyone else did. And what is,

1047
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:35,640
what was the study and what,
what's wrong with the study?

1048
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,520
I think they're mixing together
two different studies there. Um,

1049
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:43,530
but the main one was one done by Sara
Leeny in 2012 and they used a limited

1050
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:46,170
number of rats,
which are called Spragg Dawley rats,

1051
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:50,040
the rats that are good cancer models
because they're prone to cancers.

1052
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,920
And so as you're testing
different compounds against them,

1053
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:57,870
you'll have a model which is a at
least susceptible to developing tumors.

1054
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:02,460
And so if you're testing the, the
toxicity of different compound compounds,

1055
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:07,200
you would use this rat strain. The problem
is that by two years into the study,

1056
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,010
75% of the rats have,
or 77% have tumors.

1057
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,890
So Sara Leeny chose this
to do a two year study.

1058
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:19,370
He showed that the rats got tumors and
in in the paper they even show in the

1059
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:23,310
table two in the control aisle that
even the controls got tumors look at the

1060
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:26,650
same amount of tumors. Well, they,
it statistically, yes, I mean they,

1061
01:03:26,651 --> 01:03:29,040
they showed fewer. But you know,
when they talk about like, you know,

1062
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,290
they talk about five versus
eight versus nine, um,

1063
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,790
statistically the numbers were too
small to say that that was a significant

1064
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:38,490
difference. So when you
say five, eight or nine,

1065
01:03:38,491 --> 01:03:43,320
you mean percent or number rod
and out of how many? 20. Okay.

1066
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:48,530
So that could be just an issue with
the particular group of rats you had as

1067
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:53,700
opposed to you would have to do a much
larger study to get a good baseline.

1068
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,770
Is that what he was in
the statistical noise?

1069
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:59,880
So 20 rats seems like a real
low number to test things.

1070
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,170
Almost 200 overall.
But it was broken into groups for this.

1071
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,240
But the main thing in this though and the
place that really colors it for me and

1072
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:12,190
I don't know, do you have the picture
of the lumpy rats on your screen? No,

1073
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:16,320
I'm sure it's in your show. Know the
famous picture of the three Loci rats. Um,

1074
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,890
note that the author's show,
three rats, one that got GMO food,

1075
01:04:19,891 --> 01:04:23,950
one that got roundup, one that got GMO
food plus roundup and they call it GM.

1076
01:04:23,951 --> 01:04:27,480
Oh by the way, which scientists would
never do. We'd put in the transgene name,

1077
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:32,160
the neglect to show you the
control rat edge control.

1078
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:37,040
Rocco fucked up too. Well, insignificant
number of them did. But if you show us,

1079
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:41,510
but I can, how do they, how do
they, what do they do, you know,

1080
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:45,600
how do they show that picture of these
grants that are grotesquely malformed?

1081
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,930
Which if my lab rats go to
that, yeah. There they are.

1082
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:53,730
If my lab let rats get to that stage
or any, any lab in the United States,

1083
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:57,930
let their rats get to that stage,
they'd be shutdown. That's animal abuse,

1084
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:02,640
um, to, it's inhumane treatment
of animals. Is it? Well, I mean,

1085
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,240
that's something that I feel
pretty strongly against. I, I,

1086
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,390
I really severely disliked the idea of
testing things on animals in the first

1087
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:10,110
place.

1088
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:15,110
But it seems that that's where a lot of
the big improvements in medicine have

1089
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:18,010
come from. It's a real
moral dilemma. I mean, I

1090
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,860
think using animals, especially
intelligent animals, like I'm, I'm,

1091
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,670
I saw a fucking seaworld
commercial this morning.

1092
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:28,660
They made me want to throw a Mug at my
TV and they were talking about how happy

1093
01:05:28,661 --> 01:05:31,990
these whales are in a fucking
swimming pool and this guy's like,

1094
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:35,470
our whales are happy and we love
them. Like, fuck you. You do.

1095
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:38,980
We haven't stolen a whale from
its family and over 30 years.

1096
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:43,360
It's like a slave colony telling you
how these people been born. Slaves.

1097
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,900
Don't worry about it. They're happy
being slaves. We loved them here.

1098
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:50,890
If you had that exact same Goddamn
seaworld commercial and you had it about

1099
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:51,760
human beings,

1100
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,990
you would think those people would be
thought of as some of the most evil Fox on

1101
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:58,900
the planet. But they don't
think of Orcas as human beings.

1102
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,530
Even though we'll have a cerebral cortex,
a 40% larger than a human beings,

1103
01:06:02,531 --> 01:06:03,880
even though they have dialects,

1104
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,340
they have a bunch of different
words for all sorts of things.

1105
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,840
And we didn't even understand
what they're saying.

1106
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:11,950
They have super complex methods of
communication. They're very human.

1107
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:15,100
Like we,
they deals don't alter their environment.

1108
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,550
So because they don't all turn their
environment and they can't smile at us,

1109
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:19,900
you don't have articulating lips.

1110
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,480
We choose to think of them
as being inferior to us.

1111
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:26,260
And it's acceptable to have them in
a fucking swimming pool, you know?

1112
01:06:26,261 --> 01:06:29,350
And I think that's dark.
And I think that's really evil.

1113
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:33,010
And I think one day when we figure out
a way to interpret what they're saying

1114
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:37,270
and have like a Google translate for
killer whales, it's going to be a mess.

1115
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:41,500
Seaworld, they're going to go to jail
immediately. I don't even wanna watch him,

1116
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:45,880
man. It's fucking horrible. We love them.
Fuck you. You do. I don't love them.

1117
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:48,130
If you love them and they were people,
you'd let them go.

1118
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,230
I figure out a way to let them go.
You fucks.

1119
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,510
I even look at zoos when I go to
zoos and you'll see that Cheetah,

1120
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:57,580
this damn thing is supposed to be running
75 miles an hour after an antelope and

1121
01:06:57,581 --> 01:07:01,450
it's sitting there laying on a shelf
exam and all its reward system.

1122
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:05,860
It's genetic reward systems are there.
They're not satisfied like a,

1123
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:10,870
like a lion killed a woman and the woman
who is a game of Thrones expert editor

1124
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:12,334
to hear about this,

1125
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,540
she was at a surf park and the
fucking hard irony of it is she's a

1126
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:19,330
conservationist.
She loves these animals and she,

1127
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,310
she wanted to take photos of them and
she wants to protect them from poachers

1128
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:28,870
and she left the window, open the fucking
lion. God her jumped in the cage, uh,

1129
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,720
jumped into the car and pulled her out
and killed her in front of everybody.

1130
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,860
And it's, it's, it's horrible.
It's horrible, horrible thing.

1131
01:07:35,861 --> 01:07:39,220
But that's what lions do. I mean,
that is their reward system.

1132
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:43,900
That's why they're here in 2015,
they have a Predator prey reward system.

1133
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,310
That reward system isn't being recognized
at all in zoos. That's one thing.

1134
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,020
One aspect of their life.

1135
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:55,050
It is probably as satisfying and is
primal is intercourses to them and they're

1136
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:59,860
not being allowed to express it. And
that's a fucked up thing. I mean,

1137
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,840
zoos are,
I don't care what anybody says,

1138
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:03,820
they're doing all this great
work to do all this great work.

1139
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,020
They're doing it the wrong way. They're
doing it the wrong way. You know,

1140
01:08:07,021 --> 01:08:10,510
it's just, you can't lock a monkey in a
fucking cage and people just stare at it.

1141
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:13,900
That's gotta be torture for that
little thing. There's a monkey had,

1142
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,980
I think it was the Colorado,
the

1143
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,120
one that I think it was Colorado.
I forgot which is do,

1144
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:21,590
it might've been the one in Griffith Park,
but whatever the fuck it is,

1145
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,970
there's a monkey that was howling like a,
a like a mad man.

1146
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,830
He was just holding onto his cage going

1147
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:30,360
just

1148
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,070
screaming into the night.

1149
01:08:32,071 --> 01:08:35,370
And you're like telling me that's any
different than some guy in a psych ward

1150
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,470
who's trapped in aliens with giant fucking
watermelon sized eyes are staring at

1151
01:08:40,471 --> 01:08:45,000
them all day. How is that any
different? It's not, it's not. I agree.

1152
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:48,570
I mean I have a hard time with, especially
with mammals, like I can't, I don't,

1153
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:51,840
I choose not to get involved in
that. I know there's, uh, you know,

1154
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:56,440
educational aspects of zoological
terror. Um, and you know,

1155
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,800
turtles. Maybe I don't freak out so much
about, you don't seem to give a fuck. Oh,

1156
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:03,000
they kind of like it. I mean, you know,
it's like a food water brings or that,

1157
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,170
that doesn't seem to get too weird,
but I can get it to chimps and shit.

1158
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,930
Even big cats.
You just see those things that bears,

1159
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,220
I had a joke about it
though that some animals,

1160
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:16,470
the zoo doesn't seem to bother and lecture
graphs to Raf don't seem to mind at

1161
01:09:16,471 --> 01:09:17,070
all.

1162
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,580
Like they let them feed babies because
the joke was that their drafts to like

1163
01:09:20,581 --> 01:09:22,620
another day with no lions and the like,

1164
01:09:22,621 --> 01:09:24,910
if somebody came up to a giraffe
and said, listen man, um,

1165
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,700
I'm going to give you free food, there's
going to be no predators whatsoever,

1166
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:34,020
but you can't walk as far.
They'd be like, fuck yeah,

1167
01:09:34,021 --> 01:09:37,980
let's do this. Because it's the giraffes
life is goddamn terrifying all day.

1168
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,040
So for giraffes, the zoo doesn't
really seem to bug them. Like,

1169
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:44,130
especially if you go to like San Diego,
which has an awesome wildlife park,

1170
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:46,230
it's huge.
Like as far as zoos grow,

1171
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:50,370
that places top of the food chain because
that place gives them enormous spaces.

1172
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:53,820
But again, the predators aren't allowed
to express being a predator. You know, we,

1173
01:09:53,821 --> 01:09:56,460
there was an Iraqi zoo footage,
see if you could find this.

1174
01:09:56,461 --> 01:10:01,370
They let it go loose and an Iraqi zoo
and this is how they feed their lions and

1175
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:02,280
soldiers.

1176
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:07,370
This is how soldiers film this at the
beginning of the war and they just,

1177
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,680
they just have a goat and the goat.
It's fucking Triassic park.

1178
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:15,540
The goat is just a lead out of this
gate and the goat walks up and the lions

1179
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:17,760
realize that the goat
is there and then wound.

1180
01:10:17,761 --> 01:10:20,070
They're all on them and they
tear this fucker apart. Yeah.

1181
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:24,120
That's how zoos are supposed to be.
That's what his God damn zoos should be.

1182
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:28,050
What we're doing is bullshit. You
give them a plate of meat. You know,

1183
01:10:28,051 --> 01:10:31,980
we're at a zoo, Portugal on. My wife
and I were there a few years ago.

1184
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:34,970
I was there for a conference and we went
to their zoo. It's a really nice zoo.

1185
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:38,730
The zoo in Lisbon and one of the monkeys,
you know the big cage full of monkeys,

1186
01:10:38,731 --> 01:10:39,840
like a million of them in there.

1187
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:43,950
I was like 30 or 40 monkeys in one cage
and then one of them comes out between

1188
01:10:43,951 --> 01:10:45,480
the bars and starts walking around.

1189
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:48,810
They just came out of the cage
while walking around. And you know,

1190
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,720
it was pretty funny because
all the parents are letting
their kids touch it and

1191
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:55,890
stuff. Jesus Christ, bad
bed, primate decision,

1192
01:10:55,891 --> 01:10:58,980
you know that's a sh. Yeah, you're the
dummy, not the monkey. No, here it is.

1193
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,720
Look at this. These, these goats,

1194
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,660
they just opened the door and they let
him out and then they released the lines.

1195
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:07,290
They open this gate and the
lines just come Sharjah and then,

1196
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:11,280
cause they know exactly what the
fuck is going on. And you know, Eh,

1197
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:14,160
I remember people watching
it saying that it's cruel.

1198
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,060
This,

1199
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,840
the reason why you think it's cruel is
because we have been sheltered in some

1200
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:23,841
weird way to think that our way of
living should be imposed on animals.

1201
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:26,760
And that's crazy.
That's crazy thinking.

1202
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:32,010
The idea that you should give a look at
this, the lines just jump out and boom,

1203
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:35,250
they take these goats
down and they all jump in.

1204
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:36,570
They all know what they're doing.

1205
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,850
This is what they do every
day and this is how they eat.

1206
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,920
But the idea that this is somehow brutal,
God dammit,

1207
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,000
this is what it's called being a cat.
This is what cats do.

1208
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,660
What you're doing is brutal by
giving them pre cooked meat.

1209
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:51,800
They're not allowing them
to express this charge.

1210
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:56,250
They must get the bond and community
that they generate together because of

1211
01:11:56,251 --> 01:11:58,620
killing and surviving
off that kill together.

1212
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:02,940
Human beings have it and I guarantee
that lions have that as well.

1213
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,670
And you're not allowing them
to bond in the same way.

1214
01:12:05,671 --> 01:12:09,570
So part of establishing the pecking
order in the communities as well,

1215
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:13,980
who is the better hunter? Learn from
that hunter. Look how he bites that neck.

1216
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:16,280
You know, they all, they all
learn from each other. They, they,

1217
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,990
the mothers teach the babies how to fight.

1218
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,870
They teach them at a trip things
and chase things. How do they,

1219
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,650
they play with each other. You know, they,

1220
01:12:23,651 --> 01:12:27,330
they trip each other just like
they want a trip game and we don't,

1221
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,680
we don't allow that.
It's fuck

1222
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:31,760
now nature is cruel. I mean it's
the way it, the way it works,

1223
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,650
it's more cruel to not let
them express their nature.

1224
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,310
This idea that you feeding them an animal
that somebody killed nowhere near the

1225
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:42,900
cat is somehow or another more ethical
than letting the animal kill the cat or

1226
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,050
the cat kill the animal.

1227
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:48,810
It's true. It's just fucking
idiotic. It's a crazy picture.

1228
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,550
This video rather, it's just,
that's what they do, man. Well,

1229
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,950
don't say the Iraqi's never
gave us anything and that
they gave us a little bit

1230
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:59,070
of that.
But do you think that there is,

1231
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:04,190
there's an ethical way to do tests on
animals that would satisfy everybody

1232
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:09,630
almost? Is there a way, I mean, what, what
ethical way would there even be? Yeah,

1233
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,210
I think, well, it then, and
I think we have to go back,

1234
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:14,160
and this isn't my area by any stretch,

1235
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:19,050
but animal testing is a really important
part of biology and really important

1236
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:20,760
part of pharmacology.
Um,

1237
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:24,930
when you look at how animals are
used as drug models, like round,

1238
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:25,830
right now we have,

1239
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:30,950
we have animals like mice that express
or don't express a gene associated with

1240
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,950
brain function that we know is
impaired say with als in humans.

1241
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:37,980
So essentially we have these
mice that will develop als.

1242
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:41,490
So now you can use compounds to
see what solves that problem.

1243
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,560
You can build these models or f cancer
models are many in animals where you have

1244
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:50,190
these animals that are predisposed to
specific kinds of cancers or ailments that

1245
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:51,930
now allow us to do testifying them.

1246
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,740
And I think that's a really
important role for this, that, uh,

1247
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,850
that animals can help us identify
problems that help the human condition,

1248
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,500
which then can help us help animals.

1249
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:05,520
Is there a way to do it though
that's going to make everybody happy?

1250
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:08,520
I don't think there is one of those things
we have to say we're better than you.

1251
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:11,980
Well, or, or that we have to say that
these are a, that this is a, it's just

1252
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,960
like when we raise animals to eat them, I
guess. I mean, we're, uh, it, it's, it's,

1253
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:19,840
there's a purpose for these animals
that we bring them into our provision.

1254
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,220
We raised them humanely
and we are various,

1255
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:27,460
and these animals that are in these drug
experiments by definition have to be

1256
01:14:27,461 --> 01:14:31,240
very carefully, uh, um,
uh, they have to be happy.

1257
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:33,920
They have to be as happy as you can be in,
you know,

1258
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:38,320
as a rat in a cage that happy well because
there's physiology that's involved.

1259
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:39,430
And if you start seeing,

1260
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:42,700
if you have rats that are living in
conditions that are subpar or animals that

1261
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:44,080
are mistreated,

1262
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:48,910
they won't give you adequate results from
your experiments that you need to have

1263
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:52,840
incredible control with animals
that are well cared for and a,

1264
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:56,840
and give you a solid physiological
baseline where the only way,

1265
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,800
the only information being
introduced is through your treatment.

1266
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,850
Do you know, uh, being a speciesist is,

1267
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:05,070
have you ever been accused
of being a speciesist?

1268
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,690
I got a feeling I will be shortly.

1269
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:12,770
This is speciesist thinking the
thinking that you and human life is more

1270
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:15,960
important than other animals.

1271
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,190
Yeah. No, it it,

1272
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:21,370
I don't know if that's necessarily
the case that were more important,

1273
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:25,120
but we certainly have more faculties to
be able to control the hours outcomes

1274
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,320
of certain situations,

1275
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,530
but of rats were smarter than us
then decided to do tests on humans.

1276
01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:32,830
It would really suck, wouldn't
it? So screw them, let's,
we're not very smart, right?

1277
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:35,440
I mean, we're very smart
for, for other animals,

1278
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,150
but we're not very smart in terms of,

1279
01:15:37,151 --> 01:15:39,970
there's a lot of shit that human
beings do that we probably shouldn't do

1280
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:44,650
collectively, like pollution, destruction
of the environment, so on, so forth,

1281
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,050
proliferation of nuclear
weapons that that's not smart.

1282
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:48,820
There's a lot of stupid shit that we do.

1283
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,420
So I think that we're incredibly
smart for being an animal,

1284
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:56,050
but we're not necessarily smart in
terms of the universal potential of

1285
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:59,260
intelligent life. We're not,
we're idiots. That's why,

1286
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:02,380
I mean it's like there's a million fucking
arguments you could make all day long.

1287
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,130
The gay marriage thing, the
marijuana thing, the war thing,

1288
01:16:06,131 --> 01:16:09,220
there's just so many
stupid contradictions.

1289
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,140
The way human beings exist
and live their lives.

1290
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,830
If there was something that was
far more intelligent than not.

1291
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:18,831
It's like as intelligent as we are to
pigs or as we are to things that we think

1292
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:22,870
are smart, like dogs are fairly smart.
What come test would they do to us?

1293
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,370
You know,
you ever think of that doesn't know.

1294
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,360
I never really think about that very much.
I guess the analyst Lady sees this.

1295
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:30,010
Yeah.
There's only one way to get that smart.

1296
01:16:30,011 --> 01:16:33,260
You've got to fucking keep fucking
pink pigs and let the coolant,

1297
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,150
I think that he wouldn't needles and
shit. The main idea is that we've, uh,

1298
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:41,280
we've evolved as a species for a long
time away from our common ancestors.

1299
01:16:41,711 --> 01:16:41,961
You know,

1300
01:16:41,961 --> 01:16:45,760
the other primate ancestors because of
our ability to control situations and

1301
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:49,210
because we make decisions that ended
more favorable outcomes for whatever

1302
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:52,300
reasons, those are for us.
And so even though we're not,

1303
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,210
even though we do a lot of dumb stuff,
and I'm with you on that,

1304
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,730
I think we do an awful
lot of smart stuff too.

1305
01:16:57,731 --> 01:17:02,230
And I think the human capacity to create
change that's favorable for humans is,

1306
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,950
is immense.
Maybe you can do your own documentary.

1307
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:07,360
You know how Al Gore had that one,

1308
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:11,900
the inconvenient truth about uncomfortable
truth and the uncomfortable truth

1309
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:16,010
being you got to crack some eggs to
make an omelet and a, there's a lot,

1310
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,970
there's a lot going on and try to keep
human beings alive and sometimes you have

1311
01:17:19,971 --> 01:17:23,480
to make a decision. I forgot who
Nick Depaulo, one of my buddies,

1312
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:26,960
hilarious standup comedian had some joke,
I don't want to fuck the joke up,

1313
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:31,400
but it was about, uh, doing tests on a
monkey to find, you know, to cure aids.

1314
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:34,780
And it was fucking hilarious.
But he is, I don't, I don't,

1315
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:36,230
I don't remember how the joke went,

1316
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:39,290
but it was something about battery
cables and it was very funny.

1317
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:41,390
But the idea of being,
it's like, yeah, yeah.

1318
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:42,950
I'm saying I'm more
important than a monkey.

1319
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:47,090
I'm saying my mom who's dying of
cancer is more important than a rabbit.

1320
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,480
I'm saying that, I'm saying that a rat
is not as important as my children.

1321
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:54,460
I said it. Sorry, I'm a
speciesist. No. But, and, and,

1322
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:58,120
and I think that human progress has
shown that sometimes the pendulum swings

1323
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:02,120
swings a little bit too far the other way,
you know, we can think of examples. Um,

1324
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:04,250
but yeah, as soon as, again,

1325
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:09,260
as soon as you look at instead of whether
it's money or the results being more

1326
01:18:09,261 --> 01:18:12,980
important than the actions
of the individual and the
actions of the individual

1327
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:16,880
not being ethical, not that's not
important. What's important as a results,

1328
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,630
that's when we run into
problems. But that's, and so
even the circle it back then,

1329
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,350
you know,

1330
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:26,350
this is why being a scientist is so cool
is because I'm bound by data and I'm

1331
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:31,010
bound by a hypothesis that I test
using the best available tools.

1332
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:35,840
And being a public scientist is really
cool that the people who choose to do

1333
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:38,300
this like me,
and there's a lot of them in this country.

1334
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:42,560
We are really operating in the public's
trust, in the public's best interest.

1335
01:18:42,561 --> 01:18:46,370
And I think that when we see,
um, uh, unethical behavior,

1336
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,050
when we see, um, um, let's say, uh,

1337
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,140
interpretations of data, which suggests
that maybe we're going the wrong way,

1338
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,570
these things are caught in
the peer review process.

1339
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,900
These things are caught when our grants
are evaluated and they're debated in the

1340
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,680
scientific literature.
And so when we making steps in progress,

1341
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:07,430
these are very careful
guarded, um, uh, uh,

1342
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:11,870
reviewed rereviewed steps
that we're doing as,

1343
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:14,090
as a public science enterprise.

1344
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,450
And this is what's why I
wish we had more support. Um,

1345
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:20,480
I'm not here to complain about that.
Um, I wish we, and that, you know,

1346
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:24,290
people say that, you know, oh, you're
from Monsanto and we, you know, we're,

1347
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:28,880
we get nothing compared to what they
have. I mean, we're a university,

1348
01:19:28,881 --> 01:19:32,810
we get something like 3% of our
support for corporate entities.

1349
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:36,600
Everything else comes from grants
that we go out and get. And so this,

1350
01:19:36,601 --> 01:19:40,700
this is what's so important about having
an active public science enterprises to

1351
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:42,560
keep all that other stuff in check.

1352
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:47,600
I think it's also important to try to
understand the whole process that's

1353
01:19:47,601 --> 01:19:48,790
involved in,

1354
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:52,580
in science that the average person
who doesn't have background in it,

1355
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:55,850
the average person who didn't take
science other than the classes where we

1356
01:19:55,851 --> 01:19:59,980
dissected frogs and high school, it's,
there are ignorant of the process there.

1357
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:02,570
You know,
the process that creates this data and,

1358
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,430
and they don't understand where we are,

1359
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:08,190
where we come from and what we go
through. Um, if you talk to anybody,

1360
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,330
they'll tell you, well, you know,

1361
01:20:09,331 --> 01:20:12,420
universities are just paid off by
the companies and the companies,

1362
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:14,780
but somehow that sometimes that's
the case, right? Well we'll,

1363
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,370
universities do have contracts
frequently with companies. Um,

1364
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:22,860
it happens all the time, but that's
because we're the experts in other fields.

1365
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:24,630
It's a much bigger issue financially.

1366
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:27,990
Like it's been a big issue in the setting
of regulations for the stock market

1367
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:29,910
and things like that the
people did at university.

1368
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,390
You know what I'm
talking about? Those, uh,

1369
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,640
economics professors who have made
recommendations and then wound up getting

1370
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:38,610
these huge jobs with the banks after
it was over for millions of dollars.

1371
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,000
And that's wrong too though.

1372
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:42,750
I think what's really important
though is that a lot of the companies,

1373
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:45,360
pharmaceutical companies will
come to a medical school and say,

1374
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:48,900
we need you to do this clinical
trial because you are the experts.

1375
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,710
You're the ones who know this. We
trust you. And if it doesn't work,

1376
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:56,760
you give better. Tell us no one's
giving us money to make them happy.

1377
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,980
No one's telling me.
And this,

1378
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:03,720
this one pisses me off all
the time because out of
everybody you meet in science,

1379
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:04,470
you know,

1380
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:09,150
there's so many of us that really do
claim to have integrity as a first level.

1381
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:14,100
Um, I would never do something because
the company told me to do it or because a

1382
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:17,420
company paid me to do it. The punk
rock and you would not, that's right.

1383
01:21:17,421 --> 01:21:20,760
You fight that power. Oh, I fight the
power. No, because, because seriously,

1384
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:23,280
at the end of the day, you know,
I'm not a religious guy. I'm not,

1385
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,640
I don't believe that there's some
great reward for me. Um, you know,

1386
01:21:26,641 --> 01:21:31,260
what I'm leaving here is, is a, a
legacy, you know, like a product of,

1387
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:34,110
of my work and my record and
I don't want that tarnish.

1388
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,260
I believe you 100% and I'm, I'm,
I'm certainly not questioning that.

1389
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,210
I want to tell everybody if you,

1390
01:21:39,211 --> 01:21:41,520
the thing I was saying about
mathematics professors,

1391
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:45,210
you should watch a documentary
called inside job or an inside job.

1392
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:48,540
It's all about the financial crash. It's
fantastic. It's really, really, really,

1393
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:53,220
really well done. Documents
that, but people aren't
worried about people like you.

1394
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:57,750
You seem to be a great guy. What they're
worried about is evil scientists.

1395
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:02,640
That's what fucks up every science fiction
movie. Did you see 28 days later, no,

1396
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,640
28 days later and one of the greatest
Zombie movies in the history of the known

1397
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:06,420
universe.

1398
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:11,420
My personal favorite starts out because
of a medication that was created,

1399
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,260
something called rage.
I forget what,

1400
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,450
why they created it for
soldiers or something like that.

1401
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:19,470
It infects these chimps and then
these chips get it. They bite people,

1402
01:22:19,471 --> 01:22:23,010
the people get it, and then be the
Zombie outbreak takes over the world.

1403
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:27,120
And kills everybody except for a few cool
human caterpillar. Yeah. Well this, um,

1404
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:31,000
that's different. But this a, I think
you mean senopy human centipede. Yeah.

1405
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:36,600
Don't watch that. Don't, that's
different. Um, now this is a,

1406
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:40,260
this is a fucking awesome movie. Human
centipede was a goof science, Fun,

1407
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,690
evil science, but he was an evil
sign. Yeah, that's a good point.

1408
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:47,340
But the 28 days later was
about a medication that
they had intended for human

1409
01:22:47,341 --> 01:22:50,580
beings and it went terribly wrong.
Well that's,

1410
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,610
that's the kind of scientist
that people were worrying about.

1411
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:56,460
People were worried about the evil
people that are creating. I mean, look,

1412
01:22:56,461 --> 01:23:01,080
there have been scientists that have
created a weaponized drugs or weaponized a

1413
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:05,950
biological weapons rather,
that they can use on people's,
you know, certain, I mean,

1414
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:10,230
those are created by scientists like
poisons that have killed untold numbers of

1415
01:23:10,231 --> 01:23:12,580
people were also created by scientists.

1416
01:23:12,581 --> 01:23:16,300
So absolutely not just guys like you were
worried that people are worried about

1417
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:19,360
people that are way fucking smarter than
them that might be plotting some evil

1418
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:22,660
shit. Yeah, that's happened. Well,
it's happening. And then you look at,

1419
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,680
people always bring up in the GMO
discussion. Agent Orange, yes.

1420
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,360
Which is an herbicide called two,

1421
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:33,361
four D and a number of herbicides were
combined and there was this whole rainbow

1422
01:23:33,471 --> 01:23:38,080
of herbicides. It call your agent Ballou
agent Green Agent Orange was this two,

1423
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:42,010
four d stuff, two, four, five t there
they're what they call synthetic auxins.

1424
01:23:42,011 --> 01:23:43,840
They make plants grow to death basically.

1425
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:49,380
And the government was able to weaponize
a legitimate product for a warfare and

1426
01:23:50,531 --> 01:23:52,930
nothing to do with an evil
scientists necessarily,

1427
01:23:52,931 --> 01:23:57,280
but it was implementation potentially by
people who had an agenda to be able to,

1428
01:23:57,281 --> 01:24:00,140
uh, expose an enemy in
a jungle atmosphere. Um,

1429
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:03,980
along with the purification of those
products. Two, four, five t, um,

1430
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,500
was the main one was dioxin,

1431
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,520
which is what kit which would
killed people in her arms, harmed,

1432
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:09,760
harmed our own soldiers.

1433
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:14,850
That is one of the scariest things about
human beings that were willing to kill

1434
01:24:15,161 --> 01:24:20,161
your whole forest to find you just
stop and think of how fucked that is.

1435
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:24,550
We're looking for a man. We can't
find them. We're going to kill.

1436
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:28,490
Everything was going to kill every
fucking tree, every Bush, everything.

1437
01:24:28,491 --> 01:24:31,900
We're going to kill the whole forest and
flush them out. Yeah. The daisy cutter,

1438
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:34,600
you know, basically, you know
the chemical daisy cutter. God,

1439
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:37,900
that's so crazy that someone,
okay. Dot. Someone said, yeah,

1440
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:40,120
you can ruin the entire ecosystem.
Yeah.

1441
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:44,350
Go and go there and kill everything that
moves so that our boys can go in there

1442
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:46,420
and kill the people that are hiding in it.
But this was a,

1443
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:49,960
but this is an an an interesting example
that here you had something that a

1444
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:53,890
rather a really great scientist came up
with. Arthur Gauston came up with two,

1445
01:24:53,891 --> 01:24:58,720
four, five, two, four d to control
plant growth and control weeds.

1446
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,440
And it's a relatively useful
compound that we've had for 70 years.

1447
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:06,850
But yet people will say, you're
using agent orange on corn. You know,

1448
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,410
we're not using agent orange.
Here's a,

1449
01:25:08,411 --> 01:25:12,970
it's a growth regulator that was part
of Agent Orange that humans decided to

1450
01:25:12,971 --> 01:25:16,450
weaponize against other
humans. So the, that was,

1451
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:20,530
that was the created first. And then
human beings took this and said, well,

1452
01:25:20,531 --> 01:25:25,531
there's some sort of a
weaponized application of this
very beneficial discovery.

1453
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,280
Right. And then in, in a,

1454
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:30,970
in a compound that can be used safely
in an agricultural context and has been

1455
01:25:30,971 --> 01:25:32,440
since the 1940s,
see,

1456
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:36,040
against not people worrying about the
scientists are worried about the evil

1457
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:39,790
people that control the scientists and
take that stuff and turn it into this and

1458
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:44,110
then spray it in Vietnam. Yeah. If it, but
we can't go forward worrying about the,

1459
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:46,960
about the small number of evil people
that might be out there cause they're

1460
01:25:46,961 --> 01:25:48,070
going to do it there.
You know,

1461
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:50,860
there's always going to be some
guy who finds a way to, to,

1462
01:25:50,861 --> 01:25:55,390
so Obama knew his underwear,
but that doesn't mean we
outlaw underpants. You know,

1463
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:58,700
we have to, we could.
Um, but, but the idea is,

1464
01:25:58,701 --> 01:26:03,440
is that we need to think about what the
science allows us to do and not about

1465
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,130
the,
I mean,

1466
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,470
certainly be aware of malevolent uses.
Um,

1467
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:09,030
people could genetically
engineer viruses and I,

1468
01:26:09,031 --> 01:26:11,850
I believe I've heard about the
Russians doing the sit back in the,

1469
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:14,040
during the Cold War days to,
uh,

1470
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:17,330
say engineer a antibody that
would attack Human Myelin,

1471
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,930
which is the stuff that covers your nerves
so that you could essentially infect

1472
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:25,040
people with a virus that would
kill them because of paralyze them.

1473
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:29,480
These kinds of things were discussed
and biological agents and biological

1474
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:33,200
weaponry is there,
but as it has power in that dimension,

1475
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:35,720
I think that the main
conversation here is,

1476
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:39,050
is really how do we take the same
technology and use it for good?

1477
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:44,520
Essentially what we're talking about is
really what I was saying before is that

1478
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:48,110
I think a lot of your hate comes from
people that are terrified that they don't

1479
01:26:48,111 --> 01:26:52,280
understand what's going on.
You know, and that's me. I've,

1480
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:56,240
I've been into that, but I asked a lot
of questions and I, I trust you. So I go,

1481
01:26:56,241 --> 01:26:59,360
all right, it seems to make
sense. But realistically,

1482
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:02,990
when you're talking to me
about the expressions of
genes, my brain has just gone.

1483
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:06,260
Those are a bunch of noises that
represents some things I don't totally

1484
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:07,630
understand. Well, let's talk, well,

1485
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:11,830
let's talk about things that we can make
talk about. No, no, no, no, no, no idea.

1486
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:15,590
Not saying that there's anything
wrong with it. I, I'm, I'm, I'm,

1487
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:19,760
I guess I'm kind of giving
you an opportunity to say
what are things that you

1488
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:24,170
care about that I could fix or
scientists could fix? Like what are some,

1489
01:27:24,171 --> 01:27:27,050
what are some concerns
about food that you, um,

1490
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,060
the interview interviewee becomes
the interviewer. Um, what,

1491
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:33,590
what are some things that you would worry
about in terms of food or maybe food

1492
01:27:33,591 --> 01:27:35,180
abundance or, you know,
what would you like to,

1493
01:27:35,181 --> 01:27:37,250
abundance is always a big
concern for everybody,

1494
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:40,070
especially when you look at parts
of the world where you see these.

1495
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:44,300
Like I have a good friend named Justin
wren. He comes on the podcast and he, uh,

1496
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:49,310
used to fight in the UFC and now he
works in the Congo building wells.

1497
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:53,690
He's an amazing God. And he does this
thing called fight for the forgotten.

1498
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:58,100
And he goes to the Congo and he did it
with some money that viewers generated to,

1499
01:27:58,101 --> 01:28:01,850
they built a bunch of wells that are
listeners of the podcast generated through

1500
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:04,550
bitcoin and then I matched the
donation and he built these wells.

1501
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:07,760
He's just this guy, guys dedicated
his whole time to doing that,

1502
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:09,920
to give these people
clean water like that.

1503
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:13,430
I think maybe that's not even
scientific other than the ability to,

1504
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:17,390
somebody obviously had to invent these
water pumps and filters and figure out

1505
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:22,170
how to make these, these wells
portable and functional. The,

1506
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:25,820
that's really what needs to be done.

1507
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:29,840
We need to figure out a way to take the
worst parts of the world and bring them

1508
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:34,841
to a higher standard of living and give
people the opportunity to not live on

1509
01:28:35,091 --> 01:28:38,110
dirt floors with a drinking muddy
puddle water. Yeah. You know,

1510
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:43,120
I mean the fact that that it takes a guy
like Justin to go down to the Congo and

1511
01:28:43,281 --> 01:28:46,220
dedicate his life to that and a bunch
of other brave people that are doing the

1512
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:50,240
exact same thing,
but that country's never talk about it.

1513
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:52,940
They'll talk about all sorts of issues
that are going on in the environment,

1514
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,800
all sorts of things about the,

1515
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:58,250
what happens if the ocean rises
and we lose Malibu? You know,

1516
01:28:58,251 --> 01:28:59,240
like everybody's freaking out,

1517
01:28:59,241 --> 01:29:02,100
but no one's freaking out about
these poor babies with distended

1518
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,020
bellies because they're
filled with parasites.

1519
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:08,190
This is a huge human issue and if
they were white people that live,

1520
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:10,830
they looked like they were from
Norway and this was their problem.

1521
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:13,500
If they were all beautiful people that
live over there from the game of Thrones

1522
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:14,670
and they all had distended bellies,

1523
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:17,160
everybody would be freaking out and they
want to go over there and save those

1524
01:29:17,161 --> 01:29:18,600
folks. And it's, it's,

1525
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:23,160
it's one of the more disturbing and sad
or aspects of humanity. I don't know.

1526
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:25,920
I mean, science can help
certainly with medication,

1527
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:30,660
with antibiotics and antiviral drugs to
help these people that have all these

1528
01:29:30,661 --> 01:29:31,710
parasitic infections,

1529
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:35,940
which is incredibly rare in these tropical
rich jungle environment. You know,

1530
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:36,331
that's,

1531
01:29:36,331 --> 01:29:41,100
I think what would be the thing that I
would look forward to the most depicts

1532
01:29:41,101 --> 01:29:43,500
the world and stop this whole
killing other people. Shit.

1533
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,310
Let me, let me, this is really a perfect
example. I'm glad you brought that up.

1534
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:50,490
The the especially with
Uganda, with Congo, um,

1535
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:54,660
because Uganda is the one who I just
met a scientist this weekend and uh,

1536
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:57,900
he's a a plant breeder
by trade who he said,

1537
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:02,310
I'm here in the United States. Everybody
is screaming that they want choice,

1538
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,910
they want GMO versus non Gmo.
He says over by us,

1539
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:10,911
we just want food and a very sincere man
who is desperate for solutions for his

1540
01:30:12,301 --> 01:30:16,380
country and I'm going to work with him
and there's three things that could

1541
01:30:16,381 --> 01:30:20,160
really help Uganda right now and that
are actively on the ground there.

1542
01:30:20,161 --> 01:30:21,690
Three solutions for problems they have,

1543
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,260
they have something like 70% of their
calories come from or carbohydrate

1544
01:30:25,261 --> 01:30:28,980
calories come from bananas and a,
not like bananas we have,

1545
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:33,090
but African bananas and bananas
get to have two problems.

1546
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:36,840
One of them bill to
bacterial pathogen problems.

1547
01:30:36,841 --> 01:30:39,270
They get what's called does anthem
Mona's they get Phytopthora.

1548
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:44,310
There are genetic engineering solutions
that are in place that can solve both of

1549
01:30:44,311 --> 01:30:45,150
those problems.

1550
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:48,870
There's also an issue that people
there have vitamin a deficiency.

1551
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,960
So there are going blind along
this golden rice line. Um,

1552
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:56,550
you're looking at 250 million to
500 million blindness as a year. Um,

1553
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:59,220
and most of it and kids and
half of them die within a year.

1554
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,190
And it's all because of a
vitamin deficiency because
of vitamin a deficiency.

1555
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:06,870
And now they have bananas that have
the genes from a banana that produces

1556
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:09,390
vitamin a that's kind of
agriculturally useless,

1557
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,270
but they moved those into the
production banana from the Congo.

1558
01:31:12,271 --> 01:31:15,430
And this is from Uganda.
And this is a,

1559
01:31:15,431 --> 01:31:18,600
a gates foundation sponsored stuff.
And other people have done this.

1560
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:23,340
So now they have a banana that produces
vitamin A or B, well Beta carotene,

1561
01:31:23,341 --> 01:31:25,920
which is converted to vitamin A and then,
um,

1562
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:30,390
it resistant to the two main diseases.
And it can't be used.

1563
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:34,080
And you've got Greenpeace and other
activist organizations on the ground.

1564
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:37,380
They're fighting it and they're telling
people that this is just the westerners

1565
01:31:37,381 --> 01:31:40,740
coming in to take over and give you the
food and the technology they reject.

1566
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:44,820
I'm saying that will cause sterility.
Who's resisting like this, whose,

1567
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:45,900
whose these are,

1568
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:50,370
these are very wealthy western funded
organizations that are opposed to genetic

1569
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,204
modification.

1570
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:55,740
They know that if you Ganda Develops
these products and is allowed to give them

1571
01:31:55,741 --> 01:31:59,290
to their people and they solve a problem
that now the house of cards in the

1572
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:00,220
Western world falls

1573
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:04,060
down. So you really believe that there's
a conspiracy to keep these bananas out

1574
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:06,430
because if the bananas
go through and do good,

1575
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:10,540
which they think with you think they
will for sure the science says they will

1576
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,670
and that these people
think it will as well.

1577
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:16,270
And we'll open the door genetic modified
foods going into these countries and

1578
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:19,660
they'll lose the battle. So because
of that, they're willing to sacrifice.

1579
01:32:19,661 --> 01:32:24,130
He's people getting this vitamin a rich
banana. It's not a conspiracy. It's,

1580
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:28,650
if that sounds very conspiratorial, it's
true. It's, it's clear as day these, uh,

1581
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:32,080
and, and uh, in China they tell
people that it will cause infertility.

1582
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:33,850
Well that is a conspiracy.
When you agree, well,

1583
01:32:33,851 --> 01:32:36,860
I guess a conspiracy as
inspires and arrangement of it,

1584
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:40,350
I guess that is a concern. It's unethical
and it's untrue. Right? Um, but it's,

1585
01:32:40,351 --> 01:32:43,000
it's something that is, um,
yeah, and it, but it's a,

1586
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:45,400
it's very transparent is
what I guess I'm going for.

1587
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,950
This isn't some secret
clandestine operation.

1588
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:51,100
This is something that is
very well understood that
this is what they're doing.

1589
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:52,330
But to play devil's advocate,

1590
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:56,230
isn't it possible that they really
truly are concerned that a company like

1591
01:32:56,231 --> 01:33:00,640
Monsanto would get their monetary hooks
into a country and start fucking around

1592
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:02,770
there and doing a bunch of unethical shit?
Sure.

1593
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:03,970
That's what they're worried about.

1594
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:06,220
And I think that's something
that they would be worried about.

1595
01:33:06,221 --> 01:33:09,970
But let's not throw the baby out with
the bath water. Well, no, let's not.

1596
01:33:09,971 --> 01:33:13,630
Let's not, uh, accept
phantom fears for real fears.

1597
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:16,180
We got people that need problems
and let's not say, well,

1598
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:19,600
maybe Monsanto will be involved,
so let's not allow it. Um,

1599
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:22,030
let's let them use the best technology.

1600
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:25,840
And what have you tried to license this
technology and profit from their use of

1601
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:26,980
it? No, these are, these have,

1602
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:31,540
it's so funny about this is that these
are laboratories there that said we want

1603
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:35,830
biotechnology and they're developing their
own labs and their own stuff. Um, this,

1604
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,780
uh,
professor I met this weekend,

1605
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:43,110
I'm going to go there next year to help
him set up a lab to grow coffee in,

1606
01:33:43,881 --> 01:33:48,370
in a culture. I'm not GMO coffee,
which may be an interesting idea,

1607
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:49,480
but their issue is,

1608
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:53,140
is that they can make a tremendous amount
of money by growing coffee for farmers

1609
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:57,250
or farmers can grow coffee and
have a very profitable operation,

1610
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:01,360
but you can't grow enough plants of the
types that are resistant to the diseases.

1611
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:03,830
And so we're going to help them do that,
um,

1612
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:07,750
in a in tissue culture where we can
propagate tens of thousands of plants very

1613
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:10,630
quickly in a jar rather than by seed.
Um,

1614
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:14,230
he's actually going to sponsor a student
to come to my lab to do that and I'm

1615
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:17,770
going to go there and help him. But
this is the kind of place where we can,

1616
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:22,120
where you can solve a problem with this
kind of technology and where we're being

1617
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:27,100
blocked. And to me as a scientist, I
think of the 20,000 people who die. Um,

1618
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:30,640
I, I talk about it when I give talks and
I can't help but get tears in my eyes.

1619
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:35,410
When you think about the malnourished
people I've met in my travels who, um,

1620
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,760
who changed me, um, you meet them one
time and it, it, you know, you wait,

1621
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:43,900
especially when you shake their hand
and feel how weak and small they are and

1622
01:34:43,901 --> 01:34:47,500
you dedicate yourself to, um,
how you're going to fix it.

1623
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:51,130
And to have people say,
well, it's all Monsanto.

1624
01:34:51,131 --> 01:34:54,400
It's going to give you cancers and
all this stuff. That's not true.

1625
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:59,850
You block the investment in technology
and the application of technology that

1626
01:35:00,171 --> 01:35:04,130
can help. And so when, when we
have this kind of conversation,

1627
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:06,680
I think about the allergy free peanuts,

1628
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:11,540
I think about the golden banana as
the golden rice, the, uh, you know,

1629
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:12,980
all the applications we have there.

1630
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:17,360
So there's countless and we can't use
them because of a fear of the technology.

1631
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:21,780
And you feel it just an ignorance
with technology and, uh,

1632
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:26,710
they've an ignorance of
biology and genetics. But you
also think that this there,

1633
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:31,490
they have to be aware of this too,
in order to make this grand conspiracy,

1634
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:34,400
to try to keep this illegal,
to keep this out of this country.

1635
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:39,700
They have to be aware that
they are preventing good.
They have to be aware. Yes.

1636
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,630
So that's, that's Kinda
fucked up. Yes. And I, and I,

1637
01:35:43,631 --> 01:35:47,410
and to be on the good side and I
supposedly the progressive side,

1638
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:48,081
the rightful side,

1639
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:53,081
the side that everybody wants to
support and anti GMO causes everybody's

1640
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:56,000
terrified of Gmos. Yes.
And, and that's why in the,

1641
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:58,890
and the reason for this has
been so, you know, we've, uh,

1642
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:01,130
you talk about the companies that,
that do it,

1643
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:05,060
they totally failed when they rolled
out this technology. They didn't say,

1644
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:09,230
here's how it works and let's, let's,
let's, uh, take care of your fears.

1645
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:12,310
They rolled it out and said,
here's what you get. And, uh,

1646
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:17,110
people equated this with Frankenstein
and, and, you know, evil scientists, uh,

1647
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:20,240
we didn't get good education upfront.
Then over the years,

1648
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:24,490
there's been a machine of
documentaries, uh, books, uh,

1649
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:27,890
the people who sell the books and
documentaries about the dangers of this.

1650
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:30,980
They're the ones who are making the
profits. They're the shills, right?

1651
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:34,400
They're the ones that if they can
make a dollar by scaring you, uh,

1652
01:36:34,401 --> 01:36:38,120
with their product, uh, and
so they've been running free.

1653
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:42,980
Scientists like me have totally screwed
this up too because the first time I

1654
01:36:42,981 --> 01:36:47,360
talked to a public audience about
Gmos, 15 years ago, I sat down and I,

1655
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:52,570
I bombed them with science and I told
them about how it's done and details that

1656
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:56,600
they didn't need. I turned off more
people than I, than I converted.

1657
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:01,940
And only in the last three years really
have a scientists got together and said,

1658
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:05,660
this is a crisis that our technology
can't reach those who need it.

1659
01:37:05,661 --> 01:37:08,600
And we need to rethink the way
that we talk to them about science.

1660
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:13,160
And it's not about beating people
to death with the Science Hammer.

1661
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:17,750
It's about sharing ideas and things that
we all really want and our solutions

1662
01:37:17,751 --> 01:37:19,020
that we can use and,

1663
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:23,240
and really separating a technology
that's very good from companies that,

1664
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:27,740
you know, good, good, bad or whatever
we need to know the technology is good.

1665
01:37:28,850 --> 01:37:29,683
Yeah.

1666
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:34,040
What do you think initially
caused the fear of Gmos?

1667
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:34,950
Do you think it was,

1668
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,660
was there any particular story that
came out that misrepresented it,

1669
01:37:38,661 --> 01:37:40,940
that became viral or what,

1670
01:37:40,941 --> 01:37:45,260
what was it that started off this big
fear of this aspect of science and I think

1671
01:37:45,261 --> 01:37:49,180
there's always been an environmental
movement that has decried the use of uh,

1672
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:52,820
any kind of chemicals and farming
and good reason, good reason.

1673
01:37:52,821 --> 01:37:55,980
And I understand that cause you got
DDT and all these great examples

1674
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,850
back know a guy who's got bone cancer
and all these kids who grew up with had

1675
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:04,170
cancer as well because they all live near
a golf course and this shit that they

1676
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:08,820
used to the use the spray on the golf
course got into the well water and cancer

1677
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:13,390
was rampant in their small community.
These examples are in, you know,

1678
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:16,470
when you go out, I went out to Hawaii to
talk to them and they all talked about,

1679
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:19,310
you know, back in the day when the, you
know, they would, they would, you know,

1680
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,290
grow the cane and they would use all these
chemicals and whether the stories are

1681
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:22,831
true or not,

1682
01:38:22,831 --> 01:38:26,580
I think there's a certain
level of understanding that
we did things differently

1683
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:30,930
back then. And we weren't in places
like South America, they still do this.

1684
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,190
Um, you know, and uh, if a little
bit works more is better. Um,

1685
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:39,600
here the regulations are really tight
and how you can use a compound and how

1686
01:38:39,601 --> 01:38:43,230
it's allowed to be used and the residues
that are present are all very well

1687
01:38:43,231 --> 01:38:46,860
monitored. And, uh, I think
that the times are changed. But,

1688
01:38:46,861 --> 01:38:49,200
but going back to your question of,
you know, where did this come from?

1689
01:38:49,201 --> 01:38:50,360
I think people had,

1690
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:54,240
it was an environmental movement that
was certainly on guard and I'm glad

1691
01:38:54,241 --> 01:38:56,760
they're there.
I'm very happy about that.

1692
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:02,120
The problem is now that anything
that any of their former foes in the

1693
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:06,510
environmental movement would produce. You
know, Monsanto Coulda came out with, uh,

1694
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:07,890
you know,
the duck that makes gold,

1695
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:10,140
the golden eggs and they would've
said the gold is poisoned.

1696
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:15,060
Anything that comes from that company
is going to be tainted just by name. Um,

1697
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:15,731
and,
and,

1698
01:39:15,731 --> 01:39:19,140
and that's where I think a lot of this
comes from and that when they came out

1699
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:20,670
with, um, uh,

1700
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:24,810
the tomato and back when it was on
the market or any of the products that

1701
01:39:24,811 --> 01:39:28,470
they've made, it hasn't been, let's
think of what we can do with this.

1702
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:32,010
But here's just another way that this
company is rolling out a product to gain

1703
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:35,640
world domination of a food supply
and make money off chemicals.

1704
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,190
It's because of what we discussed earlier.
There's,

1705
01:39:38,191 --> 01:39:42,120
or I should say it could be because of
what we discussed earlier because people

1706
01:39:42,121 --> 01:39:47,121
have an inherent distrust in folks
that are willing to copyright life.

1707
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:53,360
The idea that you own the copyright to
some corn and I know that you genetically

1708
01:39:54,211 --> 01:39:55,890
modified it.
I know that you changed it,

1709
01:39:55,891 --> 01:40:00,780
but what it is now it's life and if you
do that to a pig, what happens then?

1710
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:04,080
If you do it to a pig, why can't you
do it to artificial livers? You know?

1711
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:05,730
Why can't you do it to all
sorts of things? You could,

1712
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:10,910
you could all of a sudden copyrighting
entire human body and own a trademark on

1713
01:40:11,011 --> 01:40:11,821
human bodies.

1714
01:40:11,821 --> 01:40:16,560
You could specifically design a type of
human that the only way you can get your

1715
01:40:16,561 --> 01:40:21,561
kid to be Alpha Beta 16 is you got to get
the Alpha Beta 16 Monsanto gene inside

1716
01:40:21,841 --> 01:40:25,410
of your kid. I mean this is not
outside the realm of possibility.

1717
01:40:25,411 --> 01:40:28,170
This is within a hundred years from now,
there'll be doing shit like that.

1718
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:31,500
That freaks people out that a corporation
could own human life. Well, yeah,

1719
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,500
I mean it's an interesting, actually,
it's kind of a little bit off topic,

1720
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:36,810
but they have that now three parent kid,

1721
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,530
you know where they've missed
the mitochondrial par with
what in the actual fuck

1722
01:40:40,531 --> 01:40:45,180
is going to happen with that
kid. The file. What if he
comes out evil? Then what?

1723
01:40:45,181 --> 01:40:48,540
Then what? Well, what if he's, what if
he's one day they're going to fuck around,

1724
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:51,210
create the antichrist, right. I
mean this is where it comes from.

1725
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:54,130
It's an interesting thought.
You know, plus you're buying

1726
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,770
more presence at Christmas for your,
you know,

1727
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,080
multiple parents or when a kid will.
Yeah, a lot of burden on the kid.

1728
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:03,940
If the parents get divorced, the
custody, the custody will be a mess.

1729
01:41:03,941 --> 01:41:06,730
And if they disagree with the way they
raised the child and then you'd have to

1730
01:41:06,731 --> 01:41:10,690
like agree like it's hard for a husband
and wife to agree on specifics as far as

1731
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:15,650
language to be used to how
to handle certain situations.
You got three people in,

1732
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:19,210
in trying to be the dad of the good news
is child support will be half of the

1733
01:41:19,211 --> 01:41:21,370
price. How many dads and how
many moms? It broken down.

1734
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:24,730
I don't think it's two mothers cause
there's a mother that provided the nucleus

1735
01:41:24,731 --> 01:41:28,960
and a mother that provided the rest of
the cell Goo and then the dad just sperm.

1736
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:34,090
Good luck with all that. That
guy is a pimp by the way.
But, but the whole idea of,

1737
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:38,290
but the cool part about this though,
as we wander into the mad scientist realm,

1738
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:38,920
again,

1739
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,010
let's think of things that have been done
that are really positive and then even

1740
01:41:42,011 --> 01:41:43,090
our patented technology.

1741
01:41:43,091 --> 01:41:46,570
So you've got a pig that was
made that has a better ability.

1742
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:50,710
It has a gene that it makes saliva that
breaks down phosphorus better in its

1743
01:41:50,711 --> 01:41:53,260
food and phosphate.
So what did,

1744
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:56,380
what it allows the pig to
do is have less toxic waste.

1745
01:41:56,470 --> 01:42:01,150
They called it the and viral pig and it
has a cause. Pigs, uh, you know, they're,

1746
01:42:01,151 --> 01:42:03,520
they're uh, effluent is, uh,

1747
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:07,630
is a problem and to have keep it out
in the environments a good thing.

1748
01:42:07,631 --> 01:42:12,280
And so they made the inviro pig and a,
at the viral pig is a, is a crushed idea.

1749
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:16,660
Now they, they're only a few embryos
left in the tank of liquid nitrogen. Um,

1750
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:17,321
they made,

1751
01:42:17,321 --> 01:42:22,321
this week I heard of a salmon that they
put a salmon gene into a salmon to make

1752
01:42:22,391 --> 01:42:24,480
it grow twice as fast.
Um,

1753
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:29,520
it was originally developed in 1989 and
that the company that's been trying to

1754
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:32,080
get it approved has been
added since the 90s.

1755
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,590
And they've got all of the approval
but it's never been finalized.

1756
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:40,770
And the beauty of this fish is it
grows to harvestable size as I,

1757
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:45,820
you know, a farmed fish in half the
time. So you're using half the stuff,

1758
01:42:45,821 --> 01:42:50,050
half the food, half the resources to eat,
make the equivalent amount of protein.

1759
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:52,990
But what of these fuckers
get out into the wild? Yeah,

1760
01:42:52,991 --> 01:42:57,160
they thought of that spawn trout.

1761
01:42:57,390 --> 01:42:59,410
Oh they're all females.
And Dan,

1762
01:42:59,411 --> 01:43:02,470
they're triploid so they have an extra
chromosome that makes them infertile.

1763
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:06,580
But design is how every bad horror movie
stars. Absolutely. One of those things.

1764
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:09,040
And all of a sudden it
becomes like a crocodile man.

1765
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,190
That's like the creature
from the Braca goon let's,

1766
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:14,140
it could be a salmon that you guys
fucked with. It turns into a person.

1767
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,360
But this is it. See that.
It's so funny cause it,

1768
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,160
cause we always spin
off into this and you,

1769
01:43:18,161 --> 01:43:23,161
especially when we go into this idea that
my fault and I'm sorry but this is a,

1770
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:26,230
it always goes back to what is
the way that this can break bad.

1771
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:30,850
That's how I look at things and and
being an eternal optimist I think of what

1772
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:32,470
are the good things we could do with this?

1773
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:36,070
Well I expect no less from a guy who
had a song called I live in an asshole.

1774
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:40,960
I would think that you would be the
eternal optimist to its social commentary

1775
01:43:40,961 --> 01:43:41,620
from a,

1776
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:46,620
you know me just obviously we're having
fun but it is the kind of thing where my

1777
01:43:47,801 --> 01:43:50,880
job is to sit around and figure
out how to solve problems.

1778
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,770
And so when you can come up with a fish
that gets to eating size and half the

1779
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:55,460
time,

1780
01:43:55,460 --> 01:44:00,300
which could in theory really relieved
pressure on wild salmon fishing and put of

1781
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:05,240
put food into the high protein and good
food into the hands of people who don't

1782
01:44:05,241 --> 01:44:08,310
normally afford fish like me, I
don't buy it. The cereal aisle,

1783
01:44:08,311 --> 01:44:11,330
logical stuff like that scares
the shit out of people. It's like,

1784
01:44:11,331 --> 01:44:14,900
you know what a lager is, right?
Sure. You saw of Napoleon dynamite.

1785
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:19,340
It's a cross between a lion and a
tiger. It's an enormous, enormous cat.

1786
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:21,380
It's the biggest cat we
know of. Right? I mean,

1787
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:24,350
I think something happens in the jeans.
Uh,

1788
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:28,910
I believe it's a male lion and a female
tiger. I might have it backwards,

1789
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,620
but the,
the,

1790
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:35,870
the gene is for regulating
the size of the growth is not,

1791
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:36,950
it's not the same.

1792
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:41,450
So something happens in the cross where
it becomes infertile because it's a

1793
01:44:41,451 --> 01:44:44,920
hybrid,
but they grow to enormous sizes.

1794
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:47,640
Like look at the size of
that God thing. Yeah. It's,

1795
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:50,900
it's some weird genetic modification,
but you know,

1796
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:54,710
not through a scientist in a lab
through just crossbreed. Yeah,

1797
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:58,410
that's a hybrid vigor. Yeah. It's um,
it's a case that when you mix up, um,

1798
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:02,930
genomes that don't normally
match and Jesus Christ,

1799
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:06,440
I wouldn't, I wouldn't be grabbing
it like that. Cause it, Lord,

1800
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:10,520
what does she handing it beat
on the stick? Some food. Well,

1801
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,960
you got to keep those things soup or
fed. Yeah, I've like really, really,

1802
01:45:14,961 --> 01:45:18,110
really fed like so they don't
even think about eating you,

1803
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:19,970
but it goes back to our corn.
You know,

1804
01:45:19,971 --> 01:45:23,510
this is why we have great corners because
there are two genomes that wouldn't

1805
01:45:23,511 --> 01:45:27,590
normally get together that humans
put together. Seedless Bananas,

1806
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:31,440
which are all the ones we have are have
an extra set of chromosomes. Your seeds.

1807
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:35,030
Seedless watermelon hasn't
separate set of chromosomes. Um,

1808
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:38,930
we've been mixing together
plant chromosomes in ways
nature could never intend

1809
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,220
for decades.

1810
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:45,610
And here you add a PR with great precision
one gene that we know what it does to

1811
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:48,740
a salmon, we can monitor
it, we understand it,

1812
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,680
and it has a beneficial
product that can help humans.

1813
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,980
And they grow these things in tanks
and Panama. They can't escape.

1814
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:55,970
They're inland Tan.

1815
01:45:55,970 --> 01:45:58,880
One of them is going to get super smart
and figuring out how to crack the and

1816
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:03,540
evolve really quick and get legs and
leave dude, solid movie, but see that.

1817
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:05,330
But that's the,
that's the,

1818
01:46:05,630 --> 01:46:08,640
there's all these precautions that
are put in place to make sure that,

1819
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:11,180
that these things can't happen.
And of course, you know, you can,

1820
01:46:11,210 --> 01:46:13,840
we can always think of the example
in all the thalidomide, you know,

1821
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,150
now you got flipper babies, you know, um,

1822
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:18,650
you can always think of
examples where it didn't work,

1823
01:46:18,651 --> 01:46:22,490
but what we tend to dismiss are the
hundreds of thousands of chance of things

1824
01:46:22,491 --> 01:46:25,280
that worked better than
expected. You know, the, uh,

1825
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:27,320
the thing that makes your
computer grow better,

1826
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:32,420
that you can have the equivalent of the
Apollo landers a firepower in terms of

1827
01:46:32,901 --> 01:46:36,050
computational ability on your wrist.
You know,

1828
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:38,200
even more than that and these,

1829
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:41,540
but these are the kinds of breakthroughs
that we take for granted. And we,

1830
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:43,190
and we ignore a always,

1831
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:47,900
but we have to stop worrying about the
what ifs and start worrying about the

1832
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,190
what cans.
And that's

1833
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:54,330
where I really want to try to get
people to refocus. Does Gmo discussion?

1834
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,490
What are your pressing problems?

1835
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:59,040
What are the things that
science can do for you today?

1836
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,560
And I think that that's where
this gets super exciting.

1837
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:03,970
But you can understand
why people are worried.

1838
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:07,230
People who don't understand the science
or it's never been explained to them.

1839
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:11,400
Certainly I don't know anybody like you
and they could sit down with like if we

1840
01:47:11,401 --> 01:47:13,080
do this for three hours,
is that even enough?

1841
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:15,900
I mean it's not really like you could
probably explain this shit to me for

1842
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:20,760
months and I would just be be slowly
working its way into my understanding.

1843
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:26,060
But people worry about what they don't
understand and they really worry about

1844
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,780
human beings,

1845
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:33,290
quote unquote playing God and manipulating
genetics and manipulating life even

1846
01:47:33,631 --> 01:47:36,590
though that's kind of what
we always have done. Yes,

1847
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:41,800
and there's a great radio lab
podcast on the Galapagos Islands.

1848
01:47:41,801 --> 01:47:42,900
It's really fantastic.

1849
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:48,410
And one of the things about it is their
attempts to keep invasive species from

1850
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:52,290
entering the Galapagos
islands and the plant species.

1851
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:55,380
We're going there from the bottom of
people's feet where they had stepped in

1852
01:47:55,381 --> 01:47:59,790
seeds and then they stepped on the grass
and these new species of grasses grow

1853
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:03,900
and pirates had left goats on the land
so that they could come back and they

1854
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:06,180
have a food source when they
would land on the island again.

1855
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:10,530
So they had these invasive goats species
that were living ultra and they realize

1856
01:48:10,531 --> 01:48:12,330
like there's no fucking way you can't,

1857
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:15,920
like everything used to be somewhere
else and then made its way across.

1858
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,660
But when we start monkeying with those,
everything's,

1859
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:23,010
that's when people are worried
because of certain outlier examples.

1860
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:26,070
When you forget about all
the crops that we plant, oh,

1861
01:48:26,071 --> 01:48:27,570
there was a totally unnatural,
right?

1862
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:30,030
I mean an orange grove is like
the most unnatural shit ever.

1863
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,320
You've dug a hole in the ground,

1864
01:48:31,321 --> 01:48:34,270
put some trees that were never
going to be there and you, you,

1865
01:48:34,271 --> 01:48:38,070
you got to have whole irrigation system
and good of Napa and look at the Wa,

1866
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,620
the wine vineyards,
that's fucking totally unnatural.

1867
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:42,240
That should just doesn't exist.

1868
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:46,710
You're never going to walk through the
wilds of some uncharted land and find a

1869
01:48:46,711 --> 01:48:49,950
fucking wine vineyard doesn't exist.
You have to grow that shit.

1870
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:53,160
You have to make that
apart of the environment.

1871
01:48:53,161 --> 01:48:54,690
But sometimes it goes terribly wrong.

1872
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,590
Like they introduce rabbits in
Australia and they don't have predators.

1873
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:03,990
So the rabbit just fucking went crazy
and ran through the entire country.

1874
01:49:03,991 --> 01:49:07,410
Like they have a huge rabbit problem.
So then they brought over foxes.

1875
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:10,680
They will bring over foxes and
cats and we'll kill the rabbits.

1876
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:14,610
But then those foxes and cats don't just
kill rabbits. You fuck, they didn't.

1877
01:49:14,611 --> 01:49:17,700
Jeanette genetically engineered foxes
that can only look at a rabbit as a

1878
01:49:17,701 --> 01:49:20,670
Predator, as a food source,
rather, they kill everything.

1879
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:25,380
So they were responsible for
like 30 something extinctions
in the entire country

1880
01:49:25,381 --> 01:49:26,700
of Australia.
It's fucked.

1881
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,520
They have these fucking foxes running
around just killing everything. So they,

1882
01:49:30,521 --> 01:49:34,350
they're so bad that they have a problem
with their sheep were the foxes are

1883
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:37,200
grabbing the baby sheep
as they're coming out,

1884
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:40,140
which is apparently like
standard Predator behavior.

1885
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:42,000
And this is freaking
people out because they,

1886
01:49:42,001 --> 01:49:45,600
this is all because humans metaled
introduced an animal to a place where it

1887
01:49:45,601 --> 01:49:48,040
didn't belong.
Then you tried to introduce a Predator to

1888
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,000
compensate for it.

1889
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:53,860
And you see this chain of events that
it's really a problem and a managerial

1890
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:58,000
nightmare for people that, or they'd have
to manage the wildlife down there. Yeah.

1891
01:49:58,001 --> 01:49:59,140
But this is so,

1892
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:02,320
but all these examples happen and
certainly things do sneak out of here and

1893
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:03,910
there. You got to go
with that. But you know,

1894
01:50:03,911 --> 01:50:06,450
when we want to talk about
releasing a new plant variety,

1895
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:07,720
and we're not talking GML,

1896
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:11,680
we're saying let's say a new
elite strawberry that we know, um,

1897
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,070
or sorghum or whatever that comes
to our university. What's a sorghum?

1898
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:18,640
Cause I like strawberry. It's a kind of
grain crop that is indigenous for Africa.

1899
01:50:18,641 --> 01:50:22,730
They use it for a biofuel now to try to,
but strawberries or whatever, we have, uh,

1900
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:26,440
the evaluation it has to go through.
You have to grow it for many seasons,

1901
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:28,720
multiple locations.
Evaluate.

1902
01:50:28,721 --> 01:50:32,590
Is it invasive or does it have the
potential to be invasive? And if it does,

1903
01:50:32,591 --> 01:50:37,090
we can't release it. Um, we have to
evaluate all the different metrics.

1904
01:50:37,091 --> 01:50:40,480
And these are not GMO crops.
These are just regular crops to,

1905
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:43,420
these are just selectively
bred crop selectively bred.

1906
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:47,620
So you would establish that the
seeds will grow this big, fat,

1907
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:49,630
juicy apple size strawberry.

1908
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:52,960
They're super juicy and delicious and
you have to do it consistently and

1909
01:50:52,961 --> 01:50:56,530
continually an isolated and have it down
to one. See that you could give them,

1910
01:50:56,531 --> 01:50:57,400
they can test themselves.

1911
01:50:57,430 --> 01:51:01,840
Well essentially we are one plant
essentially the see the strawberries are

1912
01:51:01,841 --> 01:51:05,980
another good example where you can't take
strawberry seeds from a strawberry and

1913
01:51:05,981 --> 01:51:09,730
plant them and get any two plants to
look alike. That's so crazy. So you guys,

1914
01:51:09,731 --> 01:51:12,160
how do you get those seeds
then? Now you, every,

1915
01:51:12,161 --> 01:51:14,890
every plant comes from other plants.
They make the little runners.

1916
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:18,670
And so one plant that the
strawberries that you get,

1917
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,210
the strawberry plants you buy, they're
all clones. Just like the bananas,

1918
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:26,530
just like a blueberries. Oh, I see.
So they're not grown with seeds.

1919
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,190
They're grown with a segment of the
plant that you then replant that you're

1920
01:51:30,191 --> 01:51:34,420
replant. So they're vegetative. Oh
Wow. So it's like weed. Uh, yeah.

1921
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:37,750
That's how I know about clones. So
I hear, I know dudes who grow it.

1922
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:41,680
That's the idea is that we're
able to vegetatively as they say,

1923
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:42,820
propagate these things.

1924
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:47,821
But all of this stuff is so carefully
evaluated and what GMO it goes through FDA

1925
01:51:48,430 --> 01:51:49,540
to make sure you can eat it.

1926
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:53,680
Then it goes to EPA to make sure that
it's safe for the environment and they

1927
01:51:53,681 --> 01:51:57,910
look at how does it affect insect
populations are pollinators or whatever.

1928
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:03,240
And then that goes to a USDA who then
test for farm application and invasiveness

1929
01:52:03,461 --> 01:52:04,294
and the farm.

1930
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:09,280
So these things are crazy tested
and all the what ifs are really well

1931
01:52:09,310 --> 01:52:11,560
established.
Because if there was,

1932
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:14,950
and I always have kind of the way I
think about this as if we do want,

1933
01:52:14,951 --> 01:52:17,950
assume companies are money
grubbing and horrible. Um,

1934
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,450
if something were to go wrong,

1935
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:21,940
it would be the end of the
company and gigantic lawsuits.

1936
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:26,380
And so in self preservation,
let alone profit to make a decent product.

1937
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:29,970
These things are extensively tested.
So what,

1938
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:35,040
what do you think is one of the top
unwarranted concerns that people have over

1939
01:52:36,431 --> 01:52:38,060
genetically modified foods?
Well,

1940
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:40,920
I'm glad you asked that because
I don't mean to be just um, uh,

1941
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:43,200
hate when I come off as being just a,
uh,

1942
01:52:43,810 --> 01:52:47,660
too excited and ambitious the technology.
Cause there's downsides to everything.

1943
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:51,310
Um, but you have to weigh the
risks versus limitations or bed,

1944
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:52,790
which versus benefits.

1945
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:57,320
And some of the things that we've seen is
this resistance to weed, to herbicides.

1946
01:52:57,410 --> 01:53:01,910
So one of the most useful GMO crops is
this roundup ready or really what it is,

1947
01:53:01,911 --> 01:53:06,590
is glyphosate resistant? Glyphosate is
the chemical roundup is the brand name.

1948
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:09,770
It's off patent now.
So many companies make glyphosate.

1949
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:12,650
So I tend to go a glyphosate
when we discussed the trait,

1950
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:17,000
what it allows a farmer to do is plant,
say soybeans,

1951
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:21,440
you plant the soy beans and then as the
soybeans start to grow and the weeds

1952
01:53:21,441 --> 01:53:24,710
start to grow,
the farmer goes over the top with a,

1953
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:28,610
with an application of the stuff
called glyphosate that kills the weeds.

1954
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:33,290
But the crop keeps growing through it
and as the crop grows it shades out the

1955
01:53:33,291 --> 01:53:35,900
weeds. So then the crop is
the only dominant thing there.

1956
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:39,680
The amount of glyphosate
that's applied is about um,

1957
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:43,640
you know about a mug worth per
acre in terms of active ingredient.

1958
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:48,050
It's a very potent chemical that disrupts
a very specific part of the plant's

1959
01:53:48,051 --> 01:53:49,970
biochemistry.
It can't make me no acid,

1960
01:53:49,971 --> 01:53:54,950
so can't make proteins specific proteins
and the chemistries, well known,

1961
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:57,890
we understand what it affects in.
You don't have that pathway.

1962
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:01,190
So it's a very safe chemical for humans.

1963
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:03,770
Lately it's come under a lot of fire.

1964
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:08,330
I'm actually now that people
aren't attacking the gene
insertion process or the

1965
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:09,510
portraits themselves,

1966
01:54:09,511 --> 01:54:13,910
they're going after the chemicals
used in the process of using just that

1967
01:54:13,911 --> 01:54:17,000
chemical over and over again on,
on on land.

1968
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:20,810
We've talked about this idea with Murcia
and what mutations and with the one

1969
01:54:20,811 --> 01:54:22,580
that happens to figure it out surviving,

1970
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:26,150
there are weeds that can
grow through glyphosate.

1971
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:29,750
And when that one we'd can grow
through because of a mutation,

1972
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:33,920
now it drops it seeds and pretty soon
you got a major problem because all the

1973
01:54:33,921 --> 01:54:35,300
rest of the competitors are gone.

1974
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:39,830
And these weeds take over and now you
have to come up with other methods such as

1975
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:42,560
plowing or uh,
other herbicides to get rid of them.

1976
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:47,870
So this is still confusing to me.
You,

1977
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:52,010
the plants are all coming from clones,
but you sell people seeds.

1978
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:57,070
So where do the seeds come from? Why am I
dumb? No, no, no, it was this confusing.

1979
01:54:57,110 --> 01:54:59,600
Well, we're, we're literally
literally talking apples and oranges.

1980
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:03,230
So we're talking about clones. We're
talking about things like strawberries,

1981
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:07,550
oranges, apples. When we're
talking about soybeans or corn.

1982
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:11,150
So if somebody buys those, those
strawberries, yes. If you like,

1983
01:55:11,151 --> 01:55:12,470
you make this mega strawberry,

1984
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:16,220
how does someone get a seed to
plant for those mega strawberries?

1985
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,990
If it's all clones, new
clone seats, I know that they
just take the clonal plants.

1986
01:55:20,991 --> 01:55:22,550
So strawberries make runners.

1987
01:55:22,610 --> 01:55:26,180
So you have a plant that then makes a
little daughter plant that comes off it

1988
01:55:26,630 --> 01:55:30,080
and then you just get those
daughter plants and plant
those in your field so you

1989
01:55:30,081 --> 01:55:34,280
don't sell them seeds. You sell them
plants. We sell them. Well not we, not me,

1990
01:55:34,281 --> 01:55:36,230
but um,
but our nurseries.

1991
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:40,250
So if University of Florida comes up
with a new strawberry, that's fantastic.

1992
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:42,110
They'll take that foundational plant,

1993
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:45,810
do many years of to make sure it's good
and consistent and many different places.

1994
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:49,860
And then that plant will go to a nursery
where it's propagated by by experts who

1995
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:53,490
make billions of plants and a couple of
years and then they sell those plants

1996
01:55:53,491 --> 01:55:54,480
back to our farmers.

1997
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:59,160
But when a person would go to the
store and they would buy seeds,

1998
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:04,110
like say heirloom tomato seeds, how
would they make those seeds? Yeah,

1999
01:56:04,111 --> 01:56:06,150
those are seeds that come
from heirloom tomato.

2000
01:56:06,151 --> 01:56:09,270
So that comes from what you think of
as single seed dissent. In other words,

2001
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:13,170
you have a tomato that has some
good qualities than its seeds.

2002
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:17,310
Also have the similar qualities they've
been inbred so that essentially there's

2003
01:56:17,311 --> 01:56:21,150
no genetic diversity within that fruit,
that every gene,

2004
01:56:21,151 --> 01:56:24,510
rather than having a copy from mom and
a copy from dad that are different,

2005
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:27,240
they're all the same or
at least very narrow.

2006
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:32,190
And so this way you can have seeds from
that same parental plant that look very

2007
01:56:32,191 --> 01:56:35,400
so that what you plant will come out to
be very similar to the parent that it

2008
01:56:35,401 --> 01:56:35,940
came from.

2009
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:39,090
But this is where it gets confusing to
me because you were telling me that if

2010
01:56:39,091 --> 01:56:43,720
someone took like one of
those tomatoes and grew,

2011
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,610
uh, took the seeds from it and
tried to grow tomato plants,

2012
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:50,750
they would not be similar
to the initial tomato. Well,

2013
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,870
the heirlooms probably
would be because of those,

2014
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:55,320
because they're so well
in bread. Okay. Okay. So,

2015
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:59,460
but a regular tomato of
Monsanto grown regular tomato,

2016
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:02,610
a hybrid tomato that came from
two very distinct parents,

2017
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:06,120
that thing's going to be a genetic
mix of many different traits.

2018
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:09,330
And that thing will give rise
to many different progeny.

2019
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:13,290
So if you got a tomato from the grocery
store, one of those Pale, funky tomatoes,

2020
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:15,750
the cut up and like Carl's
junior and you get your burger,

2021
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:20,250
that just looks like or sad if you took
the seeds for an that you could possibly

2022
01:57:20,251 --> 01:57:24,480
grow different kinds of tomatoes.
Yes. Wow. Yeah. And so, uh, but,

2023
01:57:24,481 --> 01:57:26,840
but with things like click and suck,
the could be like,

2024
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:30,990
or Cooper or it could be the next, uh,
the next best tomato you've ever tasted.

2025
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:33,210
I mean,
it could be that the chances are no,

2026
01:57:33,211 --> 01:57:36,500
because they've been breeding
out all of that stuff. Um,

2027
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:39,180
we do have tomato plants
at home. Yes, I do. Yeah.

2028
01:57:39,181 --> 01:57:42,660
I'll send you some seeds for one
that you will start. None of this is,

2029
01:57:42,661 --> 01:57:47,220
this is amazing. So a guy at my, uh,
in my university named Harry Cli, he,

2030
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:50,880
they did sensory tests on hundreds
of people and they asked them, well,

2031
01:57:50,881 --> 01:57:52,650
what do you like about a tomato?
What?

2032
01:57:52,651 --> 01:57:56,040
And they tested all the heirlooms on
them and they tested what heirlooms they

2033
01:57:56,041 --> 01:57:57,270
liked and which ones they didn't.

2034
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:02,220
Then they took apart chemically what's
in each one of those kinds of tomatoes

2035
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:03,960
and they analyze them by,

2036
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:08,400
by maybe what the consumers were tasting
in the volatile components in the acid

2037
01:58:08,401 --> 01:58:09,420
balance and the sugars.

2038
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:14,130
And they were able to come
up with a recipe for the
perfect tomato and then they

2039
01:58:14,131 --> 01:58:17,670
made hybrids that would
fit that expectation.

2040
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:21,630
And they came out with two new tomatoes
called garden jam and garden treasure,

2041
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:23,940
which are just going to be
used in the whole market,

2042
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:28,500
but there tomatoes that have exceptionally
high flavor and it's one of these

2043
01:58:28,501 --> 01:58:32,250
heirlooms, Brett, against the
University of Florida, um, uh,

2044
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:33,540
production tomato.

2045
01:58:33,541 --> 01:58:37,380
So one of the more regular tomatoes
and the result is outstanding.

2046
01:58:37,381 --> 01:58:41,630
It grows in Florida where nothing,
everything wants to die in Florida. Uh,

2047
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:42,110
you know,

2048
01:58:42,110 --> 01:58:43,630
it's a really harsh environment,

2049
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:47,170
but now these are tomatoes are fantastic
and they do really well out here.

2050
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,420
And how do they establish those seeds?

2051
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:54,090
Then they just do it enough generations
of very specific tomatoes where they're

2052
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:57,310
confident that the seeds will yield
the same type of tomato while the two

2053
01:58:57,311 --> 01:59:01,600
parents are very well the eye,
very, very standard genetically.

2054
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:04,450
And then those two parents
get sent to a place like,

2055
01:59:04,451 --> 01:59:05,530
I don't know where they did these,

2056
01:59:05,531 --> 01:59:10,270
but it was some place like Costa Rica
or something where you can generate huge

2057
01:59:10,271 --> 01:59:13,750
amounts of hybrids where you have people
who will hand pollinate flowers with

2058
01:59:13,751 --> 01:59:16,750
the one pollen from the other
and then generate the seeds.

2059
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,570
And so that's how hybrid seeds are made.

2060
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:24,580
So they're making these seeds by hand
germinating or hand Paul and hand

2061
01:59:24,581 --> 01:59:26,700
pollinated rather. Yeah. And,

2062
01:59:26,701 --> 01:59:30,280
and the result is fantastic because
it's a combination of the best of the

2063
01:59:30,281 --> 01:59:32,710
heirlooms versus the best
of the production traits.

2064
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:37,930
And this is what's exciting for me as
a scientist is that we understand more

2065
01:59:37,931 --> 01:59:39,550
about what the consumer wants now.

2066
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,210
And we also are understanding more about
the chemistry of fruits and vegetables.

2067
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,370
So even without Gmo,

2068
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:49,240
we can understand the genes that
cause people to like tomatoes. Like,

2069
01:59:49,241 --> 01:59:53,830
what are the components of a tomato or
a strawberry that people just love and

2070
01:59:53,831 --> 01:59:57,100
then identify those compounds in breed
them back in just with traditional

2071
01:59:57,101 --> 01:59:59,620
breeding.
What is the pollination process like?

2072
01:59:59,621 --> 02:00:02,230
Because I watched this thing about,
um,

2073
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:07,740
in China they had areas where they had
decimated the bee population so badly

2074
02:00:07,931 --> 02:00:10,780
that they had a hand pollinate
a lot of their plants.

2075
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:16,260
And by sheer luck they found out that
hand pollination is far more effective.

2076
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:19,240
And if they paid people,

2077
02:00:19,241 --> 02:00:24,130
whatever the owl hourly wages is actually
more cost effective to fucking get rid

2078
02:00:24,131 --> 02:00:27,850
of the bees, which is horrible
to find out what these people,

2079
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:31,900
it was way better cause apparently
bees are just kind of random. You know,

2080
02:00:31,901 --> 02:00:33,130
they're not,
they don't do the best job,

2081
02:00:33,131 --> 02:00:34,270
but they don't know what
the fuck they're doing.

2082
02:00:34,271 --> 02:00:36,610
They don't know that they're carrying
pollen on them, you know, they're just,

2083
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:40,000
they're just kind of doing it. It's
not like a very specific goal for them.

2084
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:41,410
But when it's a specific goal,

2085
02:00:41,411 --> 02:00:44,380
and I usually like these artistic paint
brushes and brushing pollen on it,

2086
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,360
the effectiveness was like way,

2087
02:00:46,361 --> 02:00:50,070
way better than just allowing
nature to run its course. Yeah.

2088
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:53,140
It may have been the case in China and
it depends on the crop too because a lot

2089
02:00:53,141 --> 02:00:55,990
of things are wind pollinated.
So if you eat maculate,

2090
02:00:55,991 --> 02:00:59,650
all of the plants that you
plan to be the female parent,

2091
02:00:59,950 --> 02:01:02,890
if you cut out all the little stamens
and anther's the male parts, you know,

2092
02:01:02,891 --> 02:01:06,280
you had to take out a all
rude. Yeah, I know it.

2093
02:01:06,281 --> 02:01:08,590
You have to be careful when
you look online how to do this.

2094
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:13,240
And you should look up pictures of Bruce
Jenner pop up, Google emasculation it.

2095
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:17,500
Uh, so you'd go to [inaudible], you
pull out all the a star, he's a hero,

2096
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:19,510
you pull out all the time of her,

2097
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:23,350
you pull out all the stamens and then
now this plant can only be fertilized by

2098
02:01:23,351 --> 02:01:24,400
what comes from,
you know,

2099
02:01:24,401 --> 02:01:28,060
you plant the adjacent rows of the
pollen donor and now bees and wind and

2100
02:01:28,061 --> 02:01:29,170
everything else will take care of that.

2101
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,570
So these people hand
pollinate these plants,

2102
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:36,250
then grow tomatoes specifically from
those plants and then sell those seeds or

2103
02:01:36,251 --> 02:01:39,010
use those seeds to grow more me.
How many generations do they do it?

2104
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:42,050
They're confident that they can
get a seed that if you get it,

2105
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:46,460
it will grow that same specific
tomato that you guys engineered.

2106
02:01:46,461 --> 02:01:50,360
So the seed that comes from the tomato
that results from that pollination,

2107
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:54,230
those seeds are hybrids.
They have the combination of the mothers,

2108
02:01:54,770 --> 02:01:56,510
the mothers traits and
the father's traits.

2109
02:01:56,930 --> 02:02:00,590
That seed is the one that would go to
you as the consumer that now you would

2110
02:02:00,591 --> 02:02:04,430
grow a tomato plant that would produce
outstanding tomatoes. Wow. After that,

2111
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:09,440
it's a crap shoot because genes in
cells, when you're uh, you know,

2112
02:02:09,441 --> 02:02:13,850
making your, your gametes are male and
female reproductive components, you're um,

2113
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:18,320
going through homogenization is that now
you lose control of what genes are in

2114
02:02:18,321 --> 02:02:20,240
the next generation.
So that's the problem.

2115
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:21,740
I think this is a mind blower for people.

2116
02:02:21,741 --> 02:02:26,741
This one right here is for me because
I never really thought that the tomato

2117
02:02:27,351 --> 02:02:29,180
that you got,
like if you've got an heirloom tomato,

2118
02:02:29,181 --> 02:02:34,181
wouldn't necessarily grow
heirloom tomatoes from its
seeds because it's just not

2119
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:36,530
the way it works.
I mean,

2120
02:02:36,531 --> 02:02:39,260
I would have always assumed that you
would be able to get it that way,

2121
02:02:39,261 --> 02:02:41,640
but you telling me that you,
you what you guys had specifically done,

2122
02:02:41,641 --> 02:02:45,440
that you had a hand pollinate in order
to ensure that that would create those

2123
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:47,420
certain types of tomatoes.
That's fucking nuts.

2124
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:50,750
That's it's the way it goes now
when you make hybrids and, and,

2125
02:02:50,870 --> 02:02:54,500
but there's so much more cool stuff in
plant genetics that we can do because of

2126
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:55,910
this kind of thing.
It's very cool,

2127
02:02:55,911 --> 02:03:00,260
but it's disturbing again to dummies like
me because then all it comes up like,

2128
02:03:00,261 --> 02:03:00,531
whoa.

2129
02:03:00,531 --> 02:03:05,531
People are in charge of the process of
creating this very specific form of life.

2130
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:09,050
I mean that's really what that tomato is.
It's a living thing.

2131
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:12,410
It's a very specific type of
vegetable or fruit, right?

2132
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:14,090
Technically it's technically a fruit,

2133
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:17,490
a fruit like botanic that
human beings are you,

2134
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:20,660
you guys are the mothers
of these special tomatoes.

2135
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:24,260
I mean essentially it needs people. Oh
sure. Ask me about seedless watermelons.

2136
02:03:24,261 --> 02:03:27,320
I mean [inaudible] the fuck is
that about your to hear though?

2137
02:03:27,321 --> 02:03:30,110
Is that worrying what came first? The
chicken or the egg? It doesn't make sense.

2138
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:34,220
There's a case where you're
using chemicals to change
the number of chromosomes

2139
02:03:34,221 --> 02:03:37,640
in a cell. So now this plant
has twice as many chromosomes.

2140
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:41,120
So now when you cross it against one that
has the normal amount of chromosomes,

2141
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:44,750
the other results,
so we'd have let's say a two,

2142
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:47,930
two times to chromosomes and the next
generation you would cross it with

2143
02:03:47,931 --> 02:03:49,580
something that has the normal set,

2144
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:54,530
the resulting ones have
this weird intermediate set
that can't be fertile. Okay,

2145
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:56,590
I'm going to play the part
of the dumb hippie man.

2146
02:03:56,591 --> 02:03:58,220
It just doesn't feel right with you.

2147
02:03:58,250 --> 02:04:02,180
Just like fucking with nature and
not knowing the results. I mean,

2148
02:04:02,181 --> 02:04:07,181
the world has like a a biological
system and you're just tampering with it

2149
02:04:07,521 --> 02:04:10,370
without totally understanding
ramifications of what you're going to do.

2150
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:15,020
And there's all sorts of cancer and autism
that exists today and a lot of it is

2151
02:04:15,021 --> 02:04:18,020
because of scientists.
Ignorant to think that they're so smart.

2152
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:20,960
You're smarter than nature,
you're going to play God with tomatoes.

2153
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:25,640
I just think that's fucked man. Yeah. So
that's my, my role. It was pretty good.

2154
02:04:25,641 --> 02:04:29,090
Right? Well I've met that guy over and
over again. What do you say to that guy?

2155
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:32,840
Well, the thing that breaks my heart is
that I liked that guy pretty much to,

2156
02:04:32,841 --> 02:04:37,710
I mean, you know, he, he,
he's, he's not in my, not up
in my face about anything else.

2157
02:04:37,711 --> 02:04:38,130
He's doing

2158
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,890
his thing. We listened to the
same music. Probably we, you know,

2159
02:04:41,420 --> 02:04:43,560
we're both in the worrying
about the environment. You know,

2160
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:45,630
we're on the same page with 90%.

2161
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,980
It's just that he worries about this
in this one aspect of food production,

2162
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:54,390
that humans have always changed food
and we've just now learned how to do it

2163
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:58,620
with precision. And so this is what,
where he's got a kind of, you know,

2164
02:04:58,621 --> 02:05:02,910
have a little come to Jesus moment here
and say this is science working for him.

2165
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,060
I think again it goes
to that is is a very,

2166
02:05:08,061 --> 02:05:12,920
very complex issue that doesn't have a
lot of black and widen and it has many,

2167
02:05:12,921 --> 02:05:15,680
many shades of gray and like all things.

2168
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:18,620
There's pros and cons to
the application of it,

2169
02:05:18,621 --> 02:05:21,830
especially really complicated things
like anything involving biology,

2170
02:05:21,831 --> 02:05:22,880
there's pros and cons.

2171
02:05:22,881 --> 02:05:27,320
There's variables that we can't control
with with our consumption of food.

2172
02:05:27,321 --> 02:05:31,190
With the are the level of pollution
that we allow in the environment.

2173
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:35,090
I mean there's, we have like
dedicated numbers or, or,

2174
02:05:35,091 --> 02:05:38,540
or dissed prescribed numbers
that you shouldn't go over.

2175
02:05:38,690 --> 02:05:41,180
Like if we go over this
when we fucked up that area,

2176
02:05:41,181 --> 02:05:42,050
we've got to get out of there.

2177
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:46,010
I mean there's spots that human beings
can't go to right now because of chemical

2178
02:05:46,011 --> 02:05:49,160
dumps or because of
nuclear reactor accidents.

2179
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:52,140
There's spots that we've totally
ruined and this is just a Po,

2180
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:55,040
but we also have fucking power
everywhere. Right. You know,

2181
02:05:55,041 --> 02:05:57,740
we also have elect you me, yeah,
this some bad shit has happened,

2182
02:05:57,950 --> 02:06:01,190
but look at all the good shit.
It's 7 billion people on the planet.

2183
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:03,210
There's never been numbers like that.
Just don't,

2184
02:06:03,230 --> 02:06:06,560
the only reason why there's numbers
like that is because 100,000 of them are

2185
02:06:06,561 --> 02:06:08,690
smart as shit,
and those really,

2186
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:11,530
maybe a million might be a
million at a 7 billion, right.

2187
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:14,690
That have been responsible for
putting together this amazing society.

2188
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:18,140
It's not me, but those
people that have, yeah,

2189
02:06:18,141 --> 02:06:19,640
there's been some mistakes along the way,

2190
02:06:19,641 --> 02:06:24,641
but I think without that innovation
in that thirst for improvement,

2191
02:06:24,831 --> 02:06:25,760
that people seem to just,

2192
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:31,070
we just have like inherently like a
guy like you when you're talking about

2193
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:31,610
these,

2194
02:06:31,610 --> 02:06:35,150
the application of these technologies
and the application of this science and

2195
02:06:35,151 --> 02:06:37,430
this work, you get all jazzed up. I May,

2196
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:41,570
Sr you almost started crying when you
were talking about these people that you

2197
02:06:41,571 --> 02:06:42,560
had met that were amazing,

2198
02:06:42,610 --> 02:06:45,680
hated you have a deep connection
to this and then so you,

2199
02:06:45,681 --> 02:06:49,100
you're fucking important as shit, dude.
Well, you're more important than Jay Z.

2200
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,110
I just said it.
I'll take that.

2201
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:55,600
But you know, you know, who is responsible
for a million of those 7 billion?

2202
02:06:55,990 --> 02:06:59,740
Do you know a named Norman Borlaug? No.
You see the guy that created golden rice?

2203
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:04,210
No. Norman Borlaug. He did more than
that. Norman Borlaug was a, a wonderful,

2204
02:07:04,211 --> 02:07:07,360
simple, uh, it came from
a farm background, uh,

2205
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:11,260
became a scientist in studied ways that
he could try to solve problems on the

2206
02:07:11,261 --> 02:07:14,170
face of the earth for the hungry
and especially in India and Mexico.

2207
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:19,680
And his idea was to take the kind
of plants that may never be able to,

2208
02:07:19,991 --> 02:07:24,640
uh, uh, makes naturally and make
some crosses a dwarfing varieties.

2209
02:07:24,641 --> 02:07:27,490
So plants that were lower to the
ground that would have fewer problems.

2210
02:07:27,730 --> 02:07:32,230
And he made these crosses that really
would go to feed a billion people.

2211
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:37,060
And, um, you know, scientists, me, you
know, I look at him and I, he's like a,

2212
02:07:37,070 --> 02:07:40,870
he is the ultimate hero to me. He is a
guy who should be a household name here.

2213
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:46,240
Um, you know, I stand on the shoulders of
a giant and he passed away in 2009. And,

2214
02:07:46,241 --> 02:07:49,390
uh, those of us who have heard
about him, I've read about him, who,

2215
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:51,130
who had a chance to see him speak.

2216
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:55,330
It changes us because it was,
it was his,

2217
02:07:55,690 --> 02:07:59,290
his compassion to take care
of the needy that drove him.

2218
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:02,650
It wasn't about making a dollar.
It wasn't about Monsanto.

2219
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:05,830
It was about being the guy that when
he came to the village, everybody said,

2220
02:08:05,831 --> 02:08:09,160
let's, let's take them out to our best
restaurant because here's a guy we like.

2221
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:10,480
Um,
uh,

2222
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:14,470
he was a guy who insisted if you visited
his campus to carry your bags to your

2223
02:08:14,471 --> 02:08:18,400
car, um, despite the fact that
he was a Nobel laureate. Um,

2224
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:21,340
that's the kind of role models
that we have in science.

2225
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:25,270
And this is the kind of role model that
other people have to be aware of that

2226
02:08:25,271 --> 02:08:29,710
for every Norman Borlaug, uh, it's going
to take a few million evil scientists.

2227
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:34,540
We have to understand that. And he
made that he made crosses that were,

2228
02:08:35,370 --> 02:08:39,760
were amazingly diverse and that Brock
plants together that couldn't survive,

2229
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:43,870
that would never happen in the
wild and fed people because of it.

2230
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:47,920
See, he's the good scientists. You're
the good scientist in the movie too.

2231
02:08:47,921 --> 02:08:50,950
So when the evil scientist come and
they tried to take over the world,

2232
02:08:50,951 --> 02:08:55,150
we need you to be the ones that sound
the alarm like in every good movie,

2233
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:58,120
like the day before tomorrow, whatever
that is, day after tomorrow. Right.

2234
02:08:58,150 --> 02:09:01,210
You need the good scientist to figure it
out. The Shit's going wrong. Well, yeah,

2235
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:04,570
and then, but and then that's in there
on surveillance. I mean it's not just me.

2236
02:09:04,571 --> 02:09:07,840
There's thousands of me, much more
on surveillance now than ever before.

2237
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,940
Right before,
but not just because we're aware of it,

2238
02:09:09,941 --> 02:09:13,870
but because of the tools we
have. And it would be, to me,

2239
02:09:13,871 --> 02:09:17,620
it would be a career maker
to find something wrong
with a Monsanto product and

2240
02:09:17,621 --> 02:09:19,750
report it in the best journals.
But when you worry though,

2241
02:09:19,751 --> 02:09:22,510
like a good Russell Crowe movie that
would come after him. Not at all.

2242
02:09:22,570 --> 02:09:25,480
You wouldn't work. I'd say the very least.
I would say bring it on yet. No, totally.

2243
02:09:25,481 --> 02:09:29,950
I'm, wow. I am fearless. I, I, I
love talking to the Anti Gmo crowds.

2244
02:09:29,951 --> 02:09:33,610
I mean I go into a, and I'm the one they
call because they know I'm reasonable,

2245
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,020
but I go in the places and people will
get in my face and yell at me. I'll have,

2246
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:38,710
uh,

2247
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:43,710
people come up and scream in my face
about how my company has given their kid

2248
02:09:43,991 --> 02:09:46,300
cancer. Um, I mean I get,

2249
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:51,080
I get some heavy shit and it
happens often, but the idea is,

2250
02:09:51,081 --> 02:09:55,000
is to get into those rooms and get into
those spaces just like we're doing here

2251
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:59,200
and have a conversation and introduce
people, the technology and get them to d,

2252
02:09:59,201 --> 02:10:00,100
Monsanto wise,

2253
02:10:00,101 --> 02:10:04,780
this talk about ways that we can make
it work to make a plant products that

2254
02:10:04,781 --> 02:10:07,570
would require fewer
pesticides like the bt has.

2255
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:10,600
How many people have come up to and
yelled at you that you gave one of their

2256
02:10:10,601 --> 02:10:14,860
loved ones cancer? Um, to, to, yeah, one
of them was in Hawaii. It was a woman,

2257
02:10:15,670 --> 02:10:20,460
beautiful woman from Brazil I think
originally who had a child who had um,

2258
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:25,120
uh, who had cancer and she said, here's
what your company did to my child.

2259
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:28,880
And, um, and I accompany, did she
think you were representing? Um,

2260
02:10:28,910 --> 02:10:32,190
I assume the big hammer, one
of the big companies? Um,

2261
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:37,070
and the reason I was there was because I
was invited by the companies to come to

2262
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:40,610
the island to talk to people as a neutral
party because they were having a lot

2263
02:10:40,611 --> 02:10:42,740
of conflicts by Monsanto. Well, no,

2264
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:45,440
I was invited by the Hawaii
Crop Improvement Association,

2265
02:10:45,441 --> 02:10:47,570
which is like a group of a
whole bunch of companies.

2266
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:50,480
And they said they're not listening to us.
They don't care what we think.

2267
02:10:50,481 --> 02:10:53,870
What about an independent scientist?
And when I came there,

2268
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:58,460
I made it my business to not hang around
with the Syngenta's Monsanto's dials.

2269
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:01,750
I didn't want to talk to
the other scientists. Um,

2270
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:05,150
I wanted to talk to the farmers and I
wanted to talk to the people who were

2271
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:09,800
afraid and the people who had concerns
because I could help them understand. And,

2272
02:11:09,801 --> 02:11:12,530
and, and that was what my goal is,
to help them to talk to them. And,

2273
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:16,550
and anyone who was there,
even people who are adamantly anti Gmo,

2274
02:11:16,551 --> 02:11:19,550
I think many of them would agree
that I was very, I was often,

2275
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:23,390
I mean it was very peaceful
and very quick to engage them.

2276
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:27,770
That when I saw people in the audience
at a farmer forms where I was speaking,

2277
02:11:27,771 --> 02:11:30,230
I'd see them shaking their
heads and going, no way, no way.

2278
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:33,530
The minute I was done in the applause
was over and the questions were answered.

2279
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,570
I chased them out in the
parking lot and said,

2280
02:11:35,571 --> 02:11:38,000
I need to talk to you because this is,

2281
02:11:38,001 --> 02:11:39,920
this is where this
conversation needs to be.

2282
02:11:39,921 --> 02:11:44,030
It needs to be one on one over a pizza
and a cup of coffee. It, he can't be,

2283
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:48,220
it can't be on the internet where
there's noise from, you know,

2284
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:51,340
documentary sellers and, and,
and people with agendas were,

2285
02:11:51,341 --> 02:11:54,470
what about face to face and this woman
is yelling at you that you're responsible

2286
02:11:54,471 --> 02:11:58,010
for? Yes. Her child being ill. Like what
do you say to someone like that? I said,

2287
02:11:58,011 --> 02:11:59,460
I'm really sorry for what's happened and,

2288
02:11:59,461 --> 02:12:03,020
and I would love to help you solve this
problem or not let it happen to somebody

2289
02:12:03,021 --> 02:12:07,700
else. And I, I said, if there is something
here on the island that caused this,

2290
02:12:07,730 --> 02:12:10,370
we need to understand it and we
need to get to the bottom of it.

2291
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:13,220
But as a scientist,
it's not GMO crops.

2292
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:16,670
I mean there's nothing that I can think
of that's plausible or no evidence that

2293
02:12:16,671 --> 02:12:20,570
I know of that would point that way.
And then I told her about the, uh,

2294
02:12:20,571 --> 02:12:24,560
state USDA, the person I gave her the
name of the estate, Usta Person. I said,

2295
02:12:24,561 --> 02:12:28,190
here's the person you call and tell them
where you live in and have them come

2296
02:12:28,191 --> 02:12:32,030
talk to you about it and analyze
the patterns. And you know,

2297
02:12:32,031 --> 02:12:36,020
that's the kind of issue was this
was from another country in Brazil.

2298
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:38,890
This was in a, she does. She
was from Brazil. I think so.

2299
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:41,860
So was she living in Hawaii
when this happened? Yes.

2300
02:12:42,390 --> 02:12:44,770
So there's something that they
had dumped in Hawaii, wasn't it?

2301
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:47,390
Was the United States.
Yeah. That's the allegation.

2302
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:49,580
A lot of the people on the confused.
I thought she was,

2303
02:12:49,650 --> 02:12:53,030
cause she flew from Brazil
to talk to you. She was, um,

2304
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:56,870
I had a conversation with her and I think
I got that information from her at the

2305
02:12:56,871 --> 02:12:58,500
time cause she had a very strong accent.

2306
02:12:58,940 --> 02:13:03,940
But there's a lot of very strong anti
GMO sentiment on the island of Hawaii and

2307
02:13:04,071 --> 02:13:06,200
in Hawaii actually throughout the state.
Well,

2308
02:13:06,201 --> 02:13:09,200
I mean how could it not be sure
if you look at what they have,

2309
02:13:09,201 --> 02:13:11,420
they have paradise. Yes. And they're
like, what are you going to do?

2310
02:13:11,421 --> 02:13:15,070
Are you going to fuck with
paradise? Ah Dude, we're okay
over here. Well down here,

2311
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:18,590
which are fucking funky
bananas. But here's, here's
the deal is that uh, our, uh,

2312
02:13:18,591 --> 02:13:21,890
our, our, our farmers rely
on on this because Hawaii,

2313
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:25,250
you can grow three seasons of corn a year,
so you can use it,

2314
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:26,870
but they use it for seed production.

2315
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:31,520
You generate the seed that's planted in
Iowa on Qy. Wow. That's amazing. Yeah.

2316
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:32,250
And so,

2317
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:34,830
and you can do three seats,
three seasons a year,

2318
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:38,290
whereas the amazing weather rather
than to on the mainland or one.

2319
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:42,570
And so you're able to sell the farmer
cheaper products or keep the cost under

2320
02:13:42,571 --> 02:13:45,720
control of a product. Plus the
environment's perfect. It's dry,

2321
02:13:45,721 --> 02:13:47,100
the seed is of good quality.

2322
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:52,150
So they do a lot of seed
raising on Hawaii and um, and,

2323
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:55,500
and very strong anti sentiment.
And I understand that um,

2324
02:13:55,590 --> 02:13:59,880
it is a beautiful place but it also
employs lots of people on the islands.

2325
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:04,470
I think one of the things
that you discussed and we
talked about earlier that I

2326
02:14:04,471 --> 02:14:08,970
thought was really fascinating was this
idea that planting crops isn't really

2327
02:14:08,971 --> 02:14:13,971
natural because I was a pass
through Alberta this past
weekend and I was driving

2328
02:14:14,251 --> 02:14:18,150
through these enormous agricultural
areas and I was thinking to myself like,

2329
02:14:18,151 --> 02:14:21,240
well this is really crazy like that.
We do this,

2330
02:14:21,241 --> 02:14:26,160
we just take over these giant swaths of
land and fill it with shit we can eat.

2331
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:30,420
And then we run over it with
giant machines collecting
it and then bundle it up

2332
02:14:30,421 --> 02:14:32,400
and sell it throughout the world.
Like this is,

2333
02:14:32,580 --> 02:14:37,580
it's a really bizarre practice
and it is absolutely unnatural.

2334
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:41,820
Absolutely. It's a, and if you look at
where the crops came from that we grow,

2335
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:45,300
I mean corn doesn't belong in the, in
North America. I mean it was, well,

2336
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:49,590
I came from southern Mexico. Uh, it wasn't
in the United States and Canada. Anyway,

2337
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:51,780
um, if you look at a map
and I'll show you when,

2338
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:55,530
maybe later Urfi you look up crop
domestication, our centers of origin of,

2339
02:14:55,531 --> 02:14:57,960
of major food crops. You see that, uh,

2340
02:14:57,990 --> 02:15:02,550
there are maps in Google images that
show that you s you have sunflowers,

2341
02:15:02,790 --> 02:15:07,300
maybe some progenitors to strawberry and
blueberry and maybe some kind of brass

2342
02:15:07,301 --> 02:15:10,170
cause that might be like canola.
But for the most part,

2343
02:15:10,171 --> 02:15:13,530
there's nothing that comes from here.
No two tomatoes are from South America.

2344
02:15:13,531 --> 02:15:17,520
Potatoes, peanuts saw a
citruses from Southeast Asia.

2345
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:22,500
Apples are from cosmic Stan. All of
our, all of our cabbage, Kale, Broccoli,

2346
02:15:22,650 --> 02:15:25,350
cauliflower, all that's from the
Middle East and Mediterranean areas.

2347
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:30,310
So nothing's from here, dude. Kale
is totally natural. Fuck off. Uh,

2348
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:34,710
yeah, so this is a good example here.
This, um, but that talks about, you know,

2349
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:37,670
some of our major crops.
I'm certainly there.

2350
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:42,270
Sorghum yams and potatoes came from
South America. Peanuts, South America.

2351
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:46,800
Wow. African rice. This is nuts.

2352
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:50,600
There's lots of good example. Osh.
Yes, squash came from a south. Well,

2353
02:15:50,610 --> 02:15:53,760
it's also from, uh, Mexico
along with beans. Uh,

2354
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:56,190
close to where I'm amazed
was a domesticated.

2355
02:15:56,340 --> 02:15:59,280
So there's some kinds of squash that were
native to North America, but not many.

2356
02:15:59,281 --> 02:16:03,870
Look. S Paga, what does that
PE Peppo Peppo keep us flash.

2357
02:16:03,871 --> 02:16:06,870
So people's like, uh,
like, um, uh, the, uh,

2358
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:11,640
any kind of a Q Courbet's like a pumpkin's
and like the squash is quickness is

2359
02:16:11,641 --> 02:16:13,950
like we have,
it's weird when you look for Yams.

2360
02:16:14,010 --> 02:16:17,540
I know creepy little island in the
middle of nowhere, but that this

2361
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:22,800
is, that they love that stuff.
The HR something there that,

2362
02:16:22,801 --> 02:16:25,680
that's where yams come from, but
they take a, but this is the,

2363
02:16:25,710 --> 02:16:30,100
this is all of the movement from those
crops was human mediated. Humans drag

2364
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,970
that stuff around.

2365
02:16:31,070 --> 02:16:35,500
Chenwa and so all of our domestication
that we've done has been human

2366
02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:37,850
facilitated and the genetics
change accordingly. Oh,

2367
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:41,930
so there's some yams that are also
from South America, it seems. Oh,

2368
02:16:42,330 --> 02:16:45,820
at central. That's South America.
South America there. But what,

2369
02:16:45,821 --> 02:16:47,980
but this is the beauty of this.
If you look at strawberry,

2370
02:16:47,981 --> 02:16:52,000
it's a great story because strawberry
grows naturally on the forest floors of

2371
02:16:52,001 --> 02:16:56,500
North America and also from Chile.
But the two are two different species.

2372
02:16:56,710 --> 02:16:58,600
So there's two different
kinds of yams then.

2373
02:16:58,690 --> 02:17:01,330
And it's like you different
species that says it is.

2374
02:17:01,331 --> 02:17:03,730
It's got two different names.
Two different Yemenis.

2375
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:06,910
That always weirds me out too. Why
does it have to fucking names? Look,

2376
02:17:06,911 --> 02:17:11,830
it's got a rapper name. It's, you know,
it's coolio as your name's not coolio.

2377
02:17:11,831 --> 02:17:15,580
What's your fucking name? You know that
guy? What's his name? Two Chainz, Bro.

2378
02:17:15,581 --> 02:17:16,960
That's not your name.
It can't go on.

2379
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:21,130
You can't go on CNN and debate Nancy
grace about pot. You don't even,

2380
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:24,010
you don't have a real name. Your
name. See goddamn name. Yeah,

2381
02:17:24,011 --> 02:17:28,870
but this is a cool story. If you look
at it, look at this though. Like Yams.

2382
02:17:28,871 --> 02:17:33,490
Why do we have to, what's this? What's
your fucking name, dude? It's, no, it's d.

2383
02:17:33,491 --> 02:17:37,190
What does it, how does, I don't even know.
I don't even know what the genus is on,

2384
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:38,900
on that. But you know, gee, try,

2385
02:17:39,910 --> 02:17:43,870
try for the d trip it up versus
the Alotta and they're just,

2386
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:47,350
they're just reproductively isolated. And
so they are essentially the same thing.

2387
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:51,430
Are they interchangeable? They're
probably two species from the same genus.

2388
02:17:51,431 --> 02:17:54,340
So they're related,
but there's reproductively isolated.

2389
02:17:54,370 --> 02:17:57,220
Why do they have wrapper names? They
cause they can't cross with each other.

2390
02:17:57,220 --> 02:17:59,590
Unlike rappers say can't
cross with each other.

2391
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:02,140
Why don't they have their
name then? Why didn't we, why?

2392
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:04,720
Why do we have to dumb it down?
Just call it Yam and Yam.

2393
02:18:04,930 --> 02:18:09,640
Why isn't one D Trifecta and one
d alerta [inaudible] what it is.

2394
02:18:09,641 --> 02:18:12,390
It's the m one and m two or I've,
but nobody thinks about it that way.

2395
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:13,870
You go to a supermarket,
it doesn't say that.

2396
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:17,340
Well because the ones you get in the
supermarket are probably just one kind.

2397
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:21,970
This other thing is probably, uh, some
freaky. It doesn't work in production,

2398
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:27,100
but it is ultimately very fascinating
to look at this map and think about what

2399
02:18:27,101 --> 02:18:28,480
it must have been like,
of course,

2400
02:18:28,750 --> 02:18:32,920
to be people that were traveling all
over the world looking for plants and

2401
02:18:32,921 --> 02:18:34,540
looking for spices.
I mean,

2402
02:18:34,541 --> 02:18:39,130
that was like a big part of the whole
trade where they would get on boats and

2403
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:43,450
travel to foreign lands. They were trying
to find plants and spices and shit.

2404
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:44,201
Oh yeah. Well, let me tell you,

2405
02:18:44,201 --> 02:18:48,070
the strawberry story is so cool that
they grow in the forest floors in North

2406
02:18:48,071 --> 02:18:49,280
America. Like, you know, uh,

2407
02:18:49,281 --> 02:18:54,010
we eastern seaboard and people were
dragging them back to the, uh, to the, uh,

2408
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:57,190
to Europe on colony ships and 15 hundreds.

2409
02:18:57,191 --> 02:19:00,670
There's lots of them going back and you
can find accounts in the literature. Um,

2410
02:19:00,671 --> 02:19:05,170
and then in 17, 14, there was a spy who
is going to South America, French spy,

2411
02:19:05,470 --> 02:19:10,450
who is going to Chile to look at,
uh, of a Spanish fortifications.

2412
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:14,650
And he found a, uh, kind of
strawberry that was being
grown by indigenous peoples.

2413
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:19,720
And he brought this thing
back to, uh, to Europe. And he
wasn't. Then, unfortunately,

2414
02:19:19,721 --> 02:19:21,650
these flowers were only male there.
It's like you,

2415
02:19:21,670 --> 02:19:24,070
you had a problem where these
plants couldn't self fertilize.

2416
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:28,100
So these plants from South America
and these plants from North America

2417
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:33,130
made their way to the botanical
garden in Versailles where a teenager

2418
02:19:33,350 --> 02:19:37,880
essentially started to identify crosses
between these two species that came in

2419
02:19:37,881 --> 02:19:40,340
different places because
of spies and colonists.

2420
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:44,840
And they're the pollen got together to
make our modern day strawberry. Whoa.

2421
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:49,550
It's got, it's got four complete sets
of chromosomes. So it's a genetic mess.

2422
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:53,180
Um, but it's something
that we all love and enjoy.

2423
02:19:53,230 --> 02:19:57,740
And in my lab helped and sequencing the
genome a few years ago. It's a, this is,

2424
02:19:57,741 --> 02:20:02,420
this is how cool that, that plant
domestication is. There's so many stories.

2425
02:20:02,421 --> 02:20:05,540
Every one of these plants has
a really cool, articulate,

2426
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:09,290
articulate story about the way
it came to be on our plate.

2427
02:20:10,110 --> 02:20:13,010
I just think plants are absolutely
fascinating. Like I said,

2428
02:20:13,170 --> 02:20:17,900
I know guys who, uh, grow marijuana
and they use clones and I,

2429
02:20:17,901 --> 02:20:21,750
I had no idea what that even meant until
I went to this guy's greenroom and I

2430
02:20:21,751 --> 02:20:25,140
was like, wait a minute, you take a,
okay, so you take a piece of this plant,

2431
02:20:25,141 --> 02:20:27,540
you grow more plants.
So he had gotten arrested,

2432
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:29,690
he was on the first guys
to get arrested for uh,

2433
02:20:29,980 --> 02:20:34,150
the medical weed and Tom
Mccormick and his, um, his setup,

2434
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:36,840
the way they had charged
him for individual plants,

2435
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:40,890
they had said it's clones were individual
plants. But if there were like in bulk,

2436
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:45,780
if there was all on one plant, it
would be legal. It would be less,

2437
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:49,410
less illegal.
Like to take that plant and clone it,

2438
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:52,440
then it becomes a unique
object in and unto itself.

2439
02:20:52,441 --> 02:20:56,160
Cause that could be used to drove,
grow more illicit drugs.

2440
02:20:56,250 --> 02:20:59,310
Right. It's an independent entity.
Yeah. I always thought it was seeds.

2441
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:03,420
Now it's funny because the, so my main
research, we didn't talk about that stuff,

2442
02:21:03,421 --> 02:21:07,740
but I work with identifying
genes associated with
flavors and strawberries and

2443
02:21:07,741 --> 02:21:11,220
things like this, using genomics
tools. But I also do a lot with light.

2444
02:21:11,580 --> 02:21:15,420
And so I do a lot with led and a lot
with how you are able to change plant

2445
02:21:15,421 --> 02:21:19,290
traits using lights. So make them taste
better or change the way they grow. Wow.

2446
02:21:19,350 --> 02:21:23,490
And, uh, I've been getting emails. I was
kind of one of the first folks in this,

2447
02:21:23,610 --> 02:21:26,820
well shouldn't say that I was in the space
early back in the late nineties. And,

2448
02:21:27,170 --> 02:21:29,070
um, I've been getting
emails from like, you know,

2449
02:21:29,071 --> 02:21:32,440
stoner eighteen@aol.com for years and,
uh,

2450
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:36,810
people asking about how do you grow a
plant that you would want to grow under

2451
02:21:36,811 --> 02:21:41,730
what color lights? Because there's
so much of, um, of that production,

2452
02:21:41,731 --> 02:21:44,670
which has been brought into
controlled environments. Um,

2453
02:21:44,710 --> 02:21:47,970
I'd never was able to answer the questions
very well because we're forbidden to

2454
02:21:47,971 --> 02:21:52,890
work on such products, um, you know,
at our university anyway. Um, and,

2455
02:21:52,891 --> 02:21:54,020
uh, but, but there's,

2456
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:58,320
but the using light to control those
aspects of plant growth and development is

2457
02:21:58,321 --> 02:21:59,520
something they're really interested in.

2458
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:01,350
That's fascinating.

2459
02:22:01,351 --> 02:22:05,790
Is there any benefit to growing plants
in sunlight as opposed to artificial

2460
02:22:05,791 --> 02:22:06,510
light?

2461
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:07,320
Well, this is, um,

2462
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:11,070
this is actually a really big part of
my program is I do what's called plant

2463
02:22:11,071 --> 02:22:11,904
whispering.

2464
02:22:12,310 --> 02:22:16,980
Wait a minute. You probably
that music, do you play your,

2465
02:22:16,981 --> 02:22:21,850
your punk rock next to them and
they grow aggressive? That's right.

2466
02:22:22,210 --> 02:22:25,980
I'm sorry. What's fight or fight?
The power plant was Flint with Sprig

2467
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:28,950
is basically where we use light as.
So if you think about a plant,

2468
02:22:28,980 --> 02:22:33,210
plants have 12 different light sensors
at least that listened to different parts

2469
02:22:33,211 --> 02:22:37,290
of the spectrum. So plants
can see red, blue, green,

2470
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:40,680
even the red light that's off the end
of the spectrum that we can't see.

2471
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:42,180
And they can see UV.

2472
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:47,160
And so when we give different pulses or
different treatments at different times

2473
02:22:47,161 --> 02:22:51,750
of the day, we can change the way a plant
grows. What metabolites it accumulates.

2474
02:22:51,751 --> 02:22:55,780
Maybe the flavors we can make. Cilantro
tastes absolutely horrible. If you,

2475
02:22:55,790 --> 02:22:58,260
if you know, if you like it, we can
make it taste. So cilantro really,

2476
02:22:58,740 --> 02:23:03,720
it's a difficult to eat. Um,
but we can change plant flavors,

2477
02:23:03,721 --> 02:23:07,380
we can change their colors,
we can change any of their attributes.

2478
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:11,550
And now we're trying to understand how
we can give light treatments to plant

2479
02:23:11,551 --> 02:23:13,320
materials like harvest strawberries,

2480
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:16,110
treat them with light before
they go into the supply chain,

2481
02:23:16,111 --> 02:23:20,190
before they go to the store and through
all the refrigeration and have them

2482
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:24,600
change their gene expression patterns so
they come out the other end better and

2483
02:23:24,601 --> 02:23:27,630
last longer in your refrigerator
or last longer in your countertop.

2484
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:32,010
So our idea is is to essentially change
the gene expression in fruits and

2485
02:23:32,011 --> 02:23:36,510
vegetables using the language of
light to dictate how they decay.

2486
02:23:36,870 --> 02:23:40,080
And my feeling is is that we've got um,

2487
02:23:40,110 --> 02:23:43,260
you know that you saved 7 billion.
Now we got 10 billion,

2488
02:23:43,290 --> 02:23:44,430
three more billion coming.

2489
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:49,520
We have to use the same space right now
if you buy a tomato at the store or you

2490
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:52,530
are, let's say you pick a
tomato off the plant in Florida,

2491
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:57,570
the odds of that tomato being eaten by
a person are one and two 50% of our food

2492
02:23:57,571 --> 02:24:02,050
is wasted. And one because it goes
bad, it either goes bad or, or, or,

2493
02:24:02,070 --> 02:24:06,660
or spoils. And in the developing world
it either spoils or gets a infestation.

2494
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:11,250
And one place where we can really solve
the problem or address the problem of

2495
02:24:11,251 --> 02:24:14,100
the 10 billion is in
postharvest technology,

2496
02:24:14,101 --> 02:24:16,620
but they called postharvest
and this isn't GMO stuff.

2497
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:18,660
This is the other thing I do. We, um,

2498
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:23,850
we're really dedicated to the idea of
getting more food for people by having a,

2499
02:24:23,851 --> 02:24:24,150
uh,

2500
02:24:24,150 --> 02:24:28,740
by having a more food last longer and
using these kinds of light treatments and

2501
02:24:28,741 --> 02:24:32,760
other kinds of, uh, uh, Ma mild chemical
treatments or washes or whatever.

2502
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,460
This is one part of it.
Make what we have last longer.

2503
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:39,660
So would this involve artificially
growing these plants and their artificial

2504
02:24:39,661 --> 02:24:44,661
lights or what did it involve like growing
the seeds from the plants grown from

2505
02:24:45,301 --> 02:24:48,260
artificial light and how would it be done?
I think if you,

2506
02:24:48,550 --> 02:24:51,990
that you'll see a lot of this online
these days that there's a lot of companies

2507
02:24:51,991 --> 02:24:55,950
that are starting and abandoned warehouses
and places where they use led lights

2508
02:24:55,951 --> 02:25:00,390
to do what's called vertical gardening,
where they grow plants in city centers,

2509
02:25:00,510 --> 02:25:03,660
um, where you don't have
the transportation costs
and the carbon footprint.

2510
02:25:04,050 --> 02:25:09,000
So you can bring plants to market cheaper
and maybe even higher quality products.

2511
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:13,500
So, um, what I think about it, and this
is where we think about this versus Gmo,

2512
02:25:13,710 --> 02:25:16,650
Gmo, we change one gene.
We know exactly what it is.

2513
02:25:16,651 --> 02:25:20,670
We understand it emo or
environmental modification of plants,

2514
02:25:20,671 --> 02:25:24,010
which is what I like think of plant
whispering. We're changing lots of

2515
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:26,110
genes in ways we don't
necessarily understand,

2516
02:25:26,111 --> 02:25:28,930
but we enjoy the outcomes
and people don't really care.

2517
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:33,760
But that's what freaks people out because
people know that like light is not an

2518
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:37,490
artificial lights, not necessarily good
for human beings. Like if you live in a,

2519
02:25:37,491 --> 02:25:41,620
a room filled with fluorescent light,
you'll get vitamin D deficiencies, right?

2520
02:25:41,650 --> 02:25:45,490
Yes. Oh, is that similar to the light
that we use for plants? And if so,

2521
02:25:45,491 --> 02:25:50,440
is there a concern that there's a similar
negative reaction somehow or another

2522
02:25:50,441 --> 02:25:53,500
in those plants where they wouldn't be
as healthy as they would be in natural

2523
02:25:53,501 --> 02:25:56,010
sunlight? Sure. That you
can have cases where, uh,

2524
02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:58,840
plants since your whole
metabolism is driven by light,

2525
02:25:58,870 --> 02:26:00,640
the whole material photosynthesis,

2526
02:26:01,030 --> 02:26:03,250
that if you have problems
with your light sensing,

2527
02:26:03,251 --> 02:26:06,250
that's why you have 13 different
light sensors that control, um,

2528
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:09,670
your growth and development because
you're paying attention to every aspect of

2529
02:26:09,671 --> 02:26:13,340
that ambient environment
and making very good, um,

2530
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:17,500
let's say predictions or conclusions based
upon the information you get from the

2531
02:26:17,501 --> 02:26:19,400
spectrum. And that's where, uh,

2532
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:22,750
we've been actually thinking where we've
applied the idea of manipulating the

2533
02:26:22,751 --> 02:26:26,170
spectrum to change the way
the plant grows. Ultimately,

2534
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:28,510
anything that isn't beneficial,
we're not interested in,

2535
02:26:28,570 --> 02:26:32,140
we want to grow better food that's more
nutritious and last longer so that we're

2536
02:26:32,141 --> 02:26:33,820
able to grow things more sustainably.

2537
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:38,230
Are these lights normal lights or are
these lights like some very specific

2538
02:26:38,231 --> 02:26:40,510
growing type lights in?

2539
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:45,860
They give off a very specific spectrum
that's not like normal led or fluorescent

2540
02:26:47,921 --> 02:26:48,270
lights.

2541
02:26:48,270 --> 02:26:51,820
Are there specific combinations of LEDs
that are computationally controlled?

2542
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,090
So it's controlled at a certain,
what would you say amperage?

2543
02:26:55,091 --> 02:26:58,250
Like what would you say as far as wattage?
Well, there, what is the light? The,

2544
02:26:58,630 --> 02:27:02,200
what's that media? You kind
of got it. It's um, these,
they're all at different. Um,

2545
02:27:02,290 --> 02:27:05,680
in the light business we call it fluence
rate the number of photons that are

2546
02:27:05,681 --> 02:27:08,990
produced per cubic foot or
per square meter. The idea is,

2547
02:27:08,991 --> 02:27:12,790
is that some of the photons we produce
that gift plants information you can't

2548
02:27:12,791 --> 02:27:17,050
see, so you can't really call it
that, uh, you know, intensity. Um,

2549
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:20,590
the stuff that's in UV and off the end
of the red part of the spectrum, it,

2550
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:24,480
it has information for plants
that's really potent, but it's uh,

2551
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:27,520
not information that you can see,
but the plant makes,

2552
02:27:27,521 --> 02:27:29,320
if you put a plant under far red light,

2553
02:27:29,380 --> 02:27:32,830
the stuff off the end of the red part
of the rainbow, the plant goes buzzard,

2554
02:27:32,850 --> 02:27:36,610
it gets, starts growing really lanky and
long. It accumulates specific pigments.

2555
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:37,783
It,
yeah.

2556
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:42,310
It allows you to manipulate the
plant size and body of the plant.

2557
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:47,640
And does it have any consequence on the
actual product to the plant produces

2558
02:27:48,941 --> 02:27:52,840
that's consumed by humans, whether it's
a tomato or an avocado or whatever.

2559
02:27:53,170 --> 02:27:56,890
Is there anything about this light that
changes the actual food that you eat?

2560
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:58,810
Oh sure. Yeah. And we, what we use it for,

2561
02:27:58,811 --> 02:28:02,320
and we've done most of our experiments
on sprouts, like Kale sprouts.

2562
02:28:02,710 --> 02:28:06,220
We can make Kale sprouts changed the level
of glucose scintillates which are the

2563
02:28:06,221 --> 02:28:10,000
anticancer compounds. We can increase
that stuff just by using light.

2564
02:28:10,330 --> 02:28:13,620
We can change, probably give you
cancer when that be ironic. Well yeah,

2565
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:16,990
you also can change the uh, like
the attractive colors, you know,

2566
02:28:16,991 --> 02:28:19,060
make things that are purple or green.

2567
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:21,800
I can make a others a
kind of lettuce can grow

2568
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,390
under eight different light treatments.

2569
02:28:23,391 --> 02:28:26,750
That gives you essentially eight different
kinds of lettuce leaves that taste

2570
02:28:26,751 --> 02:28:29,440
different. Look different,
tastes different, look diff. Wow.

2571
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:31,580
And is it discernible to the naked eye?

2572
02:28:31,581 --> 02:28:34,370
Like would I be able to walk in there
and know which one is given off?

2573
02:28:34,380 --> 02:28:36,920
Which thing? Or was it
just a no, it's just,

2574
02:28:37,010 --> 02:28:39,920
it's a recipe of light that gives us a
given output. You know what I'm saying?

2575
02:28:39,921 --> 02:28:41,240
Like if you had four different rooms,

2576
02:28:41,241 --> 02:28:42,680
you are growing for
different kinds of lettuce,

2577
02:28:42,681 --> 02:28:45,530
would I be able to walk in those rooms
and discern that there's any difference

2578
02:28:45,531 --> 02:28:49,080
in the light of each individual? Sure.
Oh, you would like crazy. Yeah. Oh, okay.

2579
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:52,700
It's um, there's a lot of this stuff
you can even find online with like, uh,

2580
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:55,190
if you look at like led and plant growth,

2581
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:58,040
you'd see all kinds of different
ways that people do this.

2582
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:02,210
The problem is that most places stick
plants under a purple light or under a

2583
02:29:02,211 --> 02:29:06,440
pink light and they get some effect. Um,
what, we don't want to just grow a plant,

2584
02:29:06,441 --> 02:29:10,460
we want to tell it how to grow and I
think the future of growing plants in

2585
02:29:10,461 --> 02:29:14,030
controlled environments will be deeply
rooted in this ability to control how

2586
02:29:14,031 --> 02:29:17,390
they grow. The keyword is control,
man. I know what you're trying to do.

2587
02:29:17,391 --> 02:29:20,930
Trying to make lettuce. It fucks with
my head. I know what you're doing dude,

2588
02:29:20,931 --> 02:29:21,764
with your light fee.

2589
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:25,730
I just seems like that's the thing that
people would be worried the most is that

2590
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:28,220
there would be some sort
of nutritional deficiency.

2591
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:31,670
And something that's grown with artificial
light that growing something in the

2592
02:29:31,671 --> 02:29:34,460
sunlight is somehow or
another better for you.

2593
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:38,030
Does that make any sense at all or is that
just total nonsense? It could be true,

2594
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:41,540
but that's the idea is that we might
not be, well, what we're looking for is,

2595
02:29:41,541 --> 02:29:44,930
again, we're not looking for like
the uh, the, you know, the, the, the,

2596
02:29:45,030 --> 02:29:46,370
the deleterious result.

2597
02:29:46,371 --> 02:29:49,520
What we're trying to do is what is the
combination of variables that we can

2598
02:29:49,521 --> 02:29:53,870
control to make something that's better
for people. That's what I'm dedicated to.

2599
02:29:53,871 --> 02:29:54,940
That's where I want to go there.

2600
02:29:55,050 --> 02:30:00,050
So it seems to me that there's just
a giant positive aspect to this about

2601
02:30:00,111 --> 02:30:03,410
keeping food for longer,
feeding more people,

2602
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:06,400
giving people nutrition and
areas where it's unavailable.

2603
02:30:06,410 --> 02:30:09,740
It seems to me that is a massive,
massive positive benefit of it.

2604
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:14,690
What can we do to medicate or
prevent any negative aspects of it?

2605
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:18,890
You know, the, the negative aspects
of it being that somehow or another,

2606
02:30:18,891 --> 02:30:21,260
it could harm people somehow or another.

2607
02:30:21,261 --> 02:30:26,261
The corporation's behind it would act in
a greedy way that would be detrimental

2608
02:30:26,361 --> 02:30:30,020
to the area where the crops are grown
or whatever. What can be done? Yeah.

2609
02:30:30,021 --> 02:30:30,980
I think in,
in,

2610
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:34,820
I guess I'm kind of a tooting our own
horn here by saying we need to support

2611
02:30:34,821 --> 02:30:36,480
public science.
You know,

2612
02:30:36,481 --> 02:30:39,920
we've got this group of people like
in the land grant university system,

2613
02:30:39,950 --> 02:30:44,390
this was a brilliant idea that came out
of the moral act back in the 1860s where

2614
02:30:44,391 --> 02:30:48,080
they established a university
in every state that's job was,

2615
02:30:48,230 --> 02:30:51,440
was to take care of the public need,
where you train the students,

2616
02:30:51,470 --> 02:30:52,490
you help to farmers,

2617
02:30:52,491 --> 02:30:55,760
you do the research that puts you at
the cutting edge to help the farmers and

2618
02:30:55,761 --> 02:30:58,970
train the students. And that's
a model that's still here today.

2619
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:03,080
University of California Davis is
the best in the world at this and a,

2620
02:31:03,081 --> 02:31:07,100
and they're amazing at the things
that happened there. The problem is,

2621
02:31:07,101 --> 02:31:11,960
is that as a nation, we've been less
excited to fund science right now.

2622
02:31:11,961 --> 02:31:16,210
If I write a proposal to the USDA
or National Science Foundation, um,

2623
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:19,710
the odds of it getting
funded are between five, 10%.

2624
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:23,790
And if you think that they have these
competitions once a year, you know,

2625
02:31:23,791 --> 02:31:26,670
you may go 10 years without
getting a research award.

2626
02:31:26,730 --> 02:31:28,260
A lot of labs are closing up.

2627
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:32,640
We're not training students like we
used to and it's because of there hasn't

2628
02:31:32,641 --> 02:31:36,480
been this public demand to fund science.

2629
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:39,930
And I think a lot of that comes from,
they go, well, people are scientists.

2630
02:31:39,931 --> 02:31:41,970
They're are just in the
pocket a Monsanto anyway.

2631
02:31:41,971 --> 02:31:44,580
Why do we care when
that's totally not true.

2632
02:31:44,970 --> 02:31:49,970
The best defense against an evil empire
is your public scientist and we're,

2633
02:31:50,910 --> 02:31:55,380
and we're struggling for tools right now.
How does one get hired?

2634
02:31:55,381 --> 02:31:59,130
Like if one is going to
college and you're graduating,

2635
02:31:59,131 --> 02:32:00,240
you're getting your master's in,

2636
02:32:00,241 --> 02:32:05,160
whenever you're getting it in and you
get recruited by a company like Monsanto,

2637
02:32:05,161 --> 02:32:07,590
has that happened or do you go
to them and look to get a job?

2638
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:11,640
Like how does a scientist become a
good scientist like yourself or an evil

2639
02:32:11,641 --> 02:32:13,250
scientist?
Like,

2640
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:16,980
even the most evil we would think
the guy who created the atomic bomb,

2641
02:32:16,981 --> 02:32:21,930
but Oppenheimer wasn't evil at all and
he was actually really disturbed by the

2642
02:32:21,931 --> 02:32:23,700
whole event,
the thing that he had created.

2643
02:32:23,701 --> 02:32:28,200
She was a part of this scientific
process that ultimately seemed necessary.

2644
02:32:28,220 --> 02:32:31,290
The time being the first person
to come up with this bomb.

2645
02:32:31,530 --> 02:32:34,230
So how does one get high,
but that's very distracting.

2646
02:32:34,231 --> 02:32:39,231
But how does one get hired like out of
college and how many scientist as more

2647
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:41,610
like a company like Monsanto employed?
Well,

2648
02:32:41,611 --> 02:32:45,740
Monsanto is I think 24,000 employees.
But Dick,

2649
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:47,730
how many of them are scientists?
I don't know. I don't know.

2650
02:32:47,731 --> 02:32:51,870
Probably a good chunk of else just takes
out the garbage. But, but to be honest,

2651
02:32:51,871 --> 02:32:52,830
that, you know, I know lots of,

2652
02:32:52,831 --> 02:32:55,890
I do know lots of people who work there
and lots of our former students from our

2653
02:32:55,891 --> 02:32:59,760
program have gone there because they're
hiring, you know, universities aren't.

2654
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:03,060
They are. And uh, but
just to give you an idea,

2655
02:33:03,061 --> 02:33:05,250
you go through at least
four years of undergraduate.

2656
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:08,700
You require sometimes a master's degree,
sometimes as a phd.

2657
02:33:08,701 --> 02:33:10,290
That takes you four to seven years.

2658
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:15,150
Then you're talking about post doc time
where you're looking at between one in

2659
02:33:15,151 --> 02:33:17,940
six years. So you're 35, 36,

2660
02:33:17,941 --> 02:33:21,870
37 years old before you ever even
get a job. And that is insane.

2661
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:26,550
And that's if you in, in academia where
I work, it's so rare to get a job.

2662
02:33:26,670 --> 02:33:29,850
Um, it's really tough getting
academic positions. Um,

2663
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,490
but the companies are
happy to take these people,

2664
02:33:32,491 --> 02:33:36,570
especially people with good backgrounds
in plant breeding because Monsanto at

2665
02:33:36,571 --> 02:33:38,940
the end of the day,
they're not a GMO company.

2666
02:33:38,941 --> 02:33:40,680
They're not a chemical company anymore.

2667
02:33:40,890 --> 02:33:44,550
They're a plant genetic improvement
company and they're working on breeding

2668
02:33:44,551 --> 02:33:48,480
plants so that then you can add
that gene to the elite background.

2669
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:52,560
There's only so much you can do with a
GMO transgene the rest of that has to be

2670
02:33:52,561 --> 02:33:57,300
done by breeding. And, uh, lots of plant
breeders, like people come through my lab,

2671
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:01,350
uh, the two plant breeders to my lab, one
of them got snapped up by one company,

2672
02:34:01,351 --> 02:34:04,590
another one got snapped up by
another. Um, right out of the PHD,

2673
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:09,540
each one of them into a six figure
plus salary plus all kinds of benefits.

2674
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:11,580
Do you ever think about
going over to the dark side?

2675
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:15,810
I've been recruited many
times and forces with you,

2676
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:20,050
but it's my mission. You
know, I, I like, I, I like,

2677
02:34:20,051 --> 02:34:24,460
how are you staying with
my star wars terminology? I
could, I could, you know, um,

2678
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:29,350
my, my Yoda said, stay in
university. You must. Um, I was, um,

2679
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:29,511
my,

2680
02:34:29,511 --> 02:34:33,010
my whole thing is I think I like being
in the public sector because I don't like

2681
02:34:33,011 --> 02:34:36,940
to have secrets. I don't
like to have proprietary
information that I can't share.

2682
02:34:37,480 --> 02:34:40,750
My whole thing is, and I've, and
I've been this way my entire career.

2683
02:34:40,751 --> 02:34:45,751
When I got the first little
bit of strawberry sequence
information with $1,800

2684
02:34:46,361 --> 02:34:49,580
grant that I got from the Florida
Strawberry Association, um,

2685
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,580
we got the first little bit
of strawberry information.

2686
02:34:51,581 --> 02:34:55,570
We gave it away because the idea was to
spark more research and more discovery.

2687
02:34:55,990 --> 02:34:58,240
We could've sat on it and
use it just for our lab.

2688
02:34:58,660 --> 02:35:02,590
But you guys live the Elon
Musk's of strawberries. That's
the idea. You know, you,

2689
02:35:02,591 --> 02:35:05,170
you make it, you distributed
your work faster, open access,

2690
02:35:05,171 --> 02:35:09,930
open source as fast as you
can. And, um, so, uh, but,

2691
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:12,760
but this is the main thing with the
companies. You know, for me it's about,

2692
02:35:13,210 --> 02:35:18,210
it's about that role and I like to work
synergistically with the companies.

2693
02:35:18,251 --> 02:35:21,490
I don't, you know, I have good
relationships with Monsanto employees,

2694
02:35:21,491 --> 02:35:25,550
Dal employees, you name
any company because we have
the same clients, you know,

2695
02:35:25,630 --> 02:35:29,590
my job is to make sure, uh, farmers
know how to use Monsanto products,

2696
02:35:29,591 --> 02:35:34,180
Monsanto seeds. So I need to know
what the company's up to. Well,

2697
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:35,593
it's just,

2698
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:40,680
it seems so crazy that it's so easy to
get hired by a giant corporation and

2699
02:35:41,111 --> 02:35:44,980
difficult to get hired by
public universities it seems,

2700
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:46,540
but it's totally logical.

2701
02:35:46,541 --> 02:35:49,810
Obviously there's going to be way more
people that are pursuing a degree in

2702
02:35:49,811 --> 02:35:51,340
science and there are openings.

2703
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:55,720
So is that difficult to encourage young
people to get into science because of

2704
02:35:55,721 --> 02:35:59,430
that? When they look at job prospects,
is that a real issue? I think it is. And,

2705
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:03,040
and really one of the funny
ironies here is that back in 1999,

2706
02:36:03,250 --> 02:36:07,780
Monsanto actually gave my university
some money towards a position.

2707
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:11,230
So they said, you guys are short on
faculty here. Let's start one there.

2708
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:15,190
And they hired a guy who's never done
anything for Monsanto ever since has done

2709
02:36:15,191 --> 02:36:18,520
some beautiful science for
the public good. And, uh,

2710
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:21,130
we're always criticized about
that. People say to me, well,

2711
02:36:21,131 --> 02:36:23,080
you've got that position
in your department.

2712
02:36:23,081 --> 02:36:26,350
That must mean everything you say has
to go to. It's like, totally not that,

2713
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:30,790
you know, I'm grateful that
companies do anything for us.
If, if anything, you know,

2714
02:36:30,791 --> 02:36:33,640
like if, if anybody wanted to
build a new building on our campus,

2715
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:36,880
I wouldn't say no, but that doesn't
mean they're going to get any favors.

2716
02:36:37,180 --> 02:36:38,680
So when you,
okay,

2717
02:36:38,710 --> 02:36:42,340
if you are involved in
any sort of a project,

2718
02:36:42,341 --> 02:36:46,510
will any sort of a scientific
analysis of something,

2719
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:51,810
are you required to release the results
to your superiors before you go public

2720
02:36:51,821 --> 02:36:53,890
with them?
Or is there no obligation whatsoever?

2721
02:36:53,891 --> 02:36:57,100
You could just tell anybody at any
time what, what you've discovered.

2722
02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:01,780
He had no obligation. I research,
I research what I research and um,

2723
02:37:01,860 --> 02:37:05,440
w what I can raise money
for from USDA, NSF, Nih,

2724
02:37:05,441 --> 02:37:09,490
wherever I can get money from public
sources, uh, even strawberry industry.

2725
02:37:09,491 --> 02:37:12,310
I can do some strawberry industry
sources that give me some funds,

2726
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:15,920
but that no one goes,
there's no filter. And

2727
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:18,980
sometimes it's good to have people
read just to make sure you don't say

2728
02:37:18,981 --> 02:37:23,300
something dumb, but there's nobody who
ever says, no, you can't publish this.

2729
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:24,170
And if they did,

2730
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:27,590
I'd publish it anyway because this
is about science and the truth.

2731
02:37:27,591 --> 02:37:30,020
It's not about making anybody happy.

2732
02:37:30,450 --> 02:37:31,920
Well that's the big conspiracy.

2733
02:37:31,950 --> 02:37:35,570
It was always the big conspiracy in
almost anything that's in the public eye

2734
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:38,460
when people are allowed to scrutinize
something from the outside.

2735
02:37:38,461 --> 02:37:42,690
And guess what the process is. I didn't
know. And that's what I had to ask you.

2736
02:37:42,900 --> 02:37:46,020
You, you could have easily just said
to me, I mean, as far as I knew,

2737
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:47,760
you could have easily just said,
well,

2738
02:37:47,790 --> 02:37:51,840
everything that I do has to go through
a board and they have to devote on

2739
02:37:51,841 --> 02:37:55,480
whether, I don't know, I have no idea.
And most people in that same place. Yes,

2740
02:37:56,040 --> 02:37:57,960
I've been accused of uh,

2741
02:37:57,990 --> 02:38:02,010
like with different jobs that have had
different shows and even working for the

2742
02:38:02,011 --> 02:38:04,590
UFC have someone telling me
what I can and can't say.

2743
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:08,850
And that's just not the case.
But most of what I do is super simple.

2744
02:38:09,030 --> 02:38:10,500
I'll just talking about fights,

2745
02:38:10,530 --> 02:38:13,320
like if someone told me not
to talk about something,

2746
02:38:13,321 --> 02:38:16,680
it would be like not much significance.
Okay.

2747
02:38:16,681 --> 02:38:21,360
It's just about a martial arts event
while you're talking about is these

2748
02:38:21,361 --> 02:38:26,361
discoveries that could potentially impact
untold thousands of people in a very

2749
02:38:26,941 --> 02:38:28,710
beneficial or in a very negative way.

2750
02:38:29,130 --> 02:38:33,090
So everybody's got that worry people.
But again,

2751
02:38:33,091 --> 02:38:34,780
it's being on the outside.
That's what

2752
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:36,670
I totally get that because when,

2753
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:39,820
and especially when we're in a country
where we're all pretty comfortable and we

2754
02:38:39,821 --> 02:38:43,810
all have plenty of food and we have a
few bucks in our wallet to do stuff that

2755
02:38:43,811 --> 02:38:45,370
we do tend to focus on the,

2756
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:48,520
the worries and I'm the what
ifs because everything's fine.

2757
02:38:48,521 --> 02:38:50,530
We're afraid of something
upsetting the apple cart.

2758
02:38:51,070 --> 02:38:55,060
But I can tell you as a scientist that
if I were to find something like just

2759
02:38:55,061 --> 02:38:57,610
through some process,
through some experiment,

2760
02:38:57,611 --> 02:39:01,600
find something wrong with a Monsanto
product or a dow product or whatever,

2761
02:39:01,601 --> 02:39:05,020
I don't like to just pick on the big m
I find something wrong with a product in

2762
02:39:05,021 --> 02:39:07,420
agriculture that would shift the paradigm,

2763
02:39:07,510 --> 02:39:10,510
that would change it from something safe
and used everywhere to something that

2764
02:39:10,511 --> 02:39:14,690
we better have some alarming care with.
Um, that would be something that it,

2765
02:39:14,830 --> 02:39:17,620
when I published that it
would be on the best journal,

2766
02:39:17,880 --> 02:39:22,390
it'll be in science or nature and then
it would be replicated by other labs

2767
02:39:22,391 --> 02:39:26,110
right away. As soon as it was
published, I would get huge notoriety.

2768
02:39:26,140 --> 02:39:30,010
I'd get grants forever.
I wouldn't be in that 5% anymore.

2769
02:39:30,011 --> 02:39:33,280
I'd be getting leading grants because
I was the guy who broke the rules.

2770
02:39:33,370 --> 02:39:37,360
I was the one who broke the paradigm and
probably get a Nobel prize out of it.

2771
02:39:37,690 --> 02:39:38,770
So you don't,

2772
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:42,220
you don't think to do would
be any negative repercussions
before it was clearly

2773
02:39:42,221 --> 02:39:44,080
established that you are
correct. I mean, if you're,

2774
02:39:44,140 --> 02:39:45,580
what like we were talking about before,

2775
02:39:45,610 --> 02:39:50,170
if it's involving a corporation that's
profiting in the billion dollar range and

2776
02:39:50,171 --> 02:39:54,730
making an insane amounts of money and you
have some information that would put a

2777
02:39:54,731 --> 02:39:58,240
monkey wrench into the gears of
this incredible moneymaking venture,

2778
02:39:58,600 --> 02:39:59,433
you don't think would,

2779
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:02,080
could repercussions. No, I'll tell
you exactly what would happen.

2780
02:40:02,090 --> 02:40:04,180
And I'm sure this is what would happen.

2781
02:40:04,390 --> 02:40:07,420
The first people I would let know
would be the company that makes it,

2782
02:40:07,870 --> 02:40:09,820
gets your product off the market.
Here's what I got.

2783
02:40:09,850 --> 02:40:13,770
And then your brakes would fill in your
car, arsenic would show up. Tuna fish.

2784
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:14,650
Well,

2785
02:40:14,650 --> 02:40:17,490
let's see. That's the kind of stuff
that you only movies and, yeah.

2786
02:40:17,491 --> 02:40:21,750
And then once again, going back, you know,
Dr Evil, you know, um, but, but it's,

2787
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:24,180
I think that a company
who would make them, who,

2788
02:40:24,270 --> 02:40:25,860
if someone were to reveal a mistake,

2789
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:28,200
they would be the first ones who
would want to know. And they might,

2790
02:40:28,290 --> 02:40:32,300
because they would have proven
though by history and in an ancient,

2791
02:40:32,301 --> 02:40:36,030
and when you go back and you talk about,
sure. Things like hobby GM, right?

2792
02:40:36,060 --> 02:40:39,330
How about this whole fucking ignition
thing? We talked about it earlier today.

2793
02:40:39,331 --> 02:40:42,780
They knew and they kept
their fucking mouth shut. No,
it's a good point. You know,

2794
02:40:42,781 --> 02:40:43,490
and it's,
and it,

2795
02:40:43,490 --> 02:40:47,550
it ties in with my kind of naive idealism
sometimes I think everybody's going to

2796
02:40:47,551 --> 02:40:50,860
do the right time. I know. Honk rock
hippy, I know, but at the same time,

2797
02:40:51,500 --> 02:40:55,290
but the other side of the coin
is, is that, uh, if I were,

2798
02:40:55,320 --> 02:41:00,240
if I was the guy who discovered
the ignition issue and I were in,

2799
02:41:00,241 --> 02:41:03,510
I was an investigative reporter and I
was able to put together seven or eight

2800
02:41:03,511 --> 02:41:07,350
cases of this and we'll tie it to the
ignition and did a study that analyzed the

2801
02:41:07,351 --> 02:41:11,340
mechanism of failure.
And I went to GE or GM and said,

2802
02:41:11,341 --> 02:41:14,970
this is a problem. This doesn't
work. And they refuse to respond.

2803
02:41:15,390 --> 02:41:18,090
I'd put this in the newspapers
that I would look at it,

2804
02:41:18,091 --> 02:41:19,800
I put a blog that everybody would see.

2805
02:41:19,801 --> 02:41:23,190
I'd come here and talk to you about it
and I would blow the lid off of that and

2806
02:41:23,191 --> 02:41:24,240
I'd get a Pulitzer Prize.

2807
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:28,770
Right. An awesome book. And the book would
get published and you'd make kazillions

2808
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:32,410
well hopefully, and it's a, but this is
how it should work is that we got to have,

2809
02:41:32,470 --> 02:41:37,000
but those are scientific processes that
go through a series of steps to develop

2810
02:41:37,001 --> 02:41:41,140
evidence that's analyzed to come to a
conclusion and then we can shape policy

2811
02:41:41,141 --> 02:41:44,890
based on that. And that's
where I get excited about,
about what we can do at sign.

2812
02:41:45,340 --> 02:41:45,640
Well there,

2813
02:41:45,640 --> 02:41:50,080
I mean there's reasons that people were
worried though about information leaking

2814
02:41:50,081 --> 02:41:51,280
out that could harm companies.

2815
02:41:51,281 --> 02:41:54,580
I mean he's reasons why people shield
their identity when they're leaking

2816
02:41:54,581 --> 02:41:57,320
certain information because if
they get caught and then those,

2817
02:41:57,380 --> 02:42:00,910
those companies get really pissed off
and they, even if it's just lawsuits,

2818
02:42:01,180 --> 02:42:04,660
I mean any company like Monsanto could
cripple any normal person just with

2819
02:42:04,661 --> 02:42:07,960
lawsuits. You would never be able to keep
up. They're just smash it with lawsuits.

2820
02:42:08,530 --> 02:42:13,060
When you are in charge of
this kind of information,

2821
02:42:13,090 --> 02:42:15,550
obviously we're not talking about the
conspiratorial stuff we're talking about

2822
02:42:15,551 --> 02:42:19,090
like the nutritional things, like the
bananas that you're passionate about,

2823
02:42:19,091 --> 02:42:21,430
that the vitamin A and m.
Um,

2824
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:25,700
what is that feeling like when you,
you,

2825
02:42:25,720 --> 02:42:28,300
you're being ignored or you're being,

2826
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:31,960
either it's a conspiracy by these
companies that they don't want,

2827
02:42:32,260 --> 02:42:35,590
or these people that they don't want
to open up the door for genetically

2828
02:42:35,591 --> 02:42:40,591
modified foods or it's ignorance to the
science involved with these people and

2829
02:42:41,681 --> 02:42:44,230
they're,
they're massive amounts of blindness.

2830
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:47,260
What does it feel like
to be the guy who knows?

2831
02:42:47,530 --> 02:42:50,500
Because that seems that's
gotta be a crazy place to be,

2832
02:42:50,860 --> 02:42:55,860
to be the scientist who actually
understands the mechanisms involved in the

2833
02:42:56,381 --> 02:43:00,940
creation of these very organic products
that were manipulated by human beings

2834
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:03,640
and how they could benefit human beings.
Nobody understands you.

2835
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:06,130
They're all thinking you're fucking crazy,
or you're a shale,

2836
02:43:06,131 --> 02:43:07,250
or what does that feel?

2837
02:43:07,330 --> 02:43:08,200
And it's horrible.

2838
02:43:08,380 --> 02:43:11,920
But this is why I appreciate you so much
and letting me do this and why people

2839
02:43:11,921 --> 02:43:15,250
like Kara Santa Maria who has been so
helpful and talking about the GMO issue.

2840
02:43:15,730 --> 02:43:18,080
Um, it, it is an opera.

2841
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:21,560
Anytime we can talk about this and
get people to understand, you know,

2842
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:24,550
where I'm coming from, that
there's trust here. Um, Joe,

2843
02:43:24,551 --> 02:43:29,551
every night I answer 30 minutes to an
hour of emails from the concern public who

2844
02:43:30,131 --> 02:43:34,210
asks questions to me about this.
I was watching your Twitter today,

2845
02:43:34,211 --> 02:43:36,710
your feed between yesterday
when I announced it,

2846
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:39,490
you were going to be on and
today, dude, you've been nonstop.

2847
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,950
I mean your tireless with this stuff.
You have a real,

2848
02:43:42,030 --> 02:43:45,210
an incredible passion for this.
I've done Reddit's where, um,

2849
02:43:45,310 --> 02:43:47,860
I would say I'll come on with
an ask me anything for, uh,

2850
02:43:47,950 --> 02:43:50,100
two hours and I'll stay on for six.
I'll stay on,

2851
02:43:50,710 --> 02:43:55,060
I'll answer a thousand questions. Every
one of them hand done. What? I mean,

2852
02:43:55,061 --> 02:43:56,230
I'm not cutting and pasting.

2853
02:43:56,610 --> 02:44:00,400
I'm addressing that person's concern
because this is how we're going to change

2854
02:44:00,401 --> 02:44:01,000
it.

2855
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:05,080
It comes from talking to people who have
concerns and and people who are worried

2856
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:08,890
and help them understand the science.
Because if they get this,

2857
02:44:09,310 --> 02:44:12,770
then they're less likely to worry
about the real problems and ever.

2858
02:44:12,790 --> 02:44:15,790
That's why we were that the artificial
problems and start focusing on the real

2859
02:44:15,791 --> 02:44:16,624
problems.

2860
02:44:16,810 --> 02:44:21,810
And how important is it to fund more
public science and to try in some way to

2861
02:44:23,201 --> 02:44:28,201
make more people attracted to what
you're doing as opposed to going over to

2862
02:44:28,811 --> 02:44:32,140
these universities.
Because if people really are concerned,

2863
02:44:32,350 --> 02:44:34,240
like probably that's the
best way to deal with it.

2864
02:44:34,241 --> 02:44:36,910
The best way to deal with
sciences to fund science. Yes,

2865
02:44:37,370 --> 02:44:41,620
100% it's the fun science and make sure
that public scientists have the tools

2866
02:44:41,621 --> 02:44:43,720
they need to maintain.
They don't get corrupted.

2867
02:44:43,721 --> 02:44:47,240
The idea of being corrupted seems so
tempting. Well, but it, but you know,

2868
02:44:47,250 --> 02:44:48,850
when we had to have to be careful because,

2869
02:44:49,150 --> 02:44:53,590
because companies can't fund individual
laboratories or programs or universities

2870
02:44:53,591 --> 02:44:55,840
and, and it doesn't
necessarily mean corruption.

2871
02:44:55,841 --> 02:44:59,090
Of course they can be very beneficial
and then they can help us a lot. And,

2872
02:44:59,091 --> 02:45:03,190
and I would love to have Monsanto hand
me a check for 5 million bucks and say,

2873
02:45:03,191 --> 02:45:05,640
have at it. Do what you want.
I bet it's on the way. Right?

2874
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:10,820
I been waiting an awfully long time
Joe and people have been saying it for,

2875
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:14,440
for 20 years now that I should be
getting everyone ready. They're ready.

2876
02:45:14,450 --> 02:45:17,260
They're writing that check right now.
They're just licked the pen. But a movie.

2877
02:45:17,500 --> 02:45:19,500
The other really cool thing
though that we can do is,

2878
02:45:19,510 --> 02:45:22,810
is I think get kids fired up
about science and with kids.

2879
02:45:22,810 --> 02:45:26,800
I find that this idea of genetic
engineering isn't a big deal to them.

2880
02:45:27,160 --> 02:45:30,970
That they kind of get it and they see
it's kind of like molecular Lego's.

2881
02:45:30,971 --> 02:45:33,270
They kind of get the idea that you can,
uh,

2882
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:36,730
take something out of one thing and
move it to another. You can move traits.

2883
02:45:36,731 --> 02:45:39,380
You can. Kids have this kind of, uh, uh,

2884
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:42,040
modular understanding of the world anyway,

2885
02:45:42,100 --> 02:45:45,130
that they're comfortable with bits and
pieces coming together in different ways

2886
02:45:45,131 --> 02:45:47,410
to make different products.
And when we talk,

2887
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:52,440
I spend about maybe two or three mornings
a month with third to fifth grade or

2888
02:45:52,721 --> 02:45:56,350
seventh graders, mostly third and
fifth. That's, there's a lot of fun.

2889
02:45:56,351 --> 02:46:00,340
Third graders have the best. And we talk
about how to solve the citrus problem.

2890
02:46:01,150 --> 02:46:06,030
And I told her graders, yeah, how
many of them say magic? Uh, well,

2891
02:46:06,070 --> 02:46:10,350
you know what they say even crazier
stuff, which is great. Well, and start us,

2892
02:46:10,850 --> 02:46:12,590
I'll give you an example.
Like I show them my way.

2893
02:46:12,591 --> 02:46:15,210
I teach this as I show them what
the problem is, that there's a,

2894
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:18,740
an insect that moves a bacterium to a
tree that get sick and it dies from bad

2895
02:46:18,741 --> 02:46:21,920
nutrition. And I'll say, what are the,
and I'll show them all that and I'll say,

2896
02:46:21,921 --> 02:46:25,310
okay, stop. Now you guys are the
scientists. Give me a solution.

2897
02:46:25,910 --> 02:46:28,970
And the hands go up. And one of them
will say, give it better nutrition.

2898
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:30,580
And then another one will say,
uh,

2899
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:34,670
maybe you could cross it with a tree
that doesn't get sick. And they get that,

2900
02:46:34,700 --> 02:46:37,700
you know, they're, they've, they've
got sex figured out. Well by then, um,

2901
02:46:37,850 --> 02:46:39,680
then you talk about, um, uh,

2902
02:46:39,800 --> 02:46:43,670
then one of 'em will say in the funny one
was build them in a dome under the sea

2903
02:46:43,671 --> 02:46:47,930
where the bug can't get to them, you
know? And, and the challenge for me,

2904
02:46:50,090 --> 02:46:53,200
that one's awesome. Yeah. Well I, I
told the teacher to keep an eye on,

2905
02:46:55,380 --> 02:46:57,440
the cool part about that
though is that he's right.

2906
02:46:57,441 --> 02:46:59,690
If you could isolate the
things from the insect.

2907
02:46:59,930 --> 02:47:03,860
And so my challenge as a teacher in that
scenario when I'm interrogating their

2908
02:47:03,861 --> 02:47:07,700
interest in science, is to somehow never
tell one of them that they're crazy,

2909
02:47:08,150 --> 02:47:11,840
that I have to take whatever answer
they give me in somehow loop it back to,

2910
02:47:11,841 --> 02:47:15,190
well, here's how you're writing,
how it just might work. Oh,

2911
02:47:15,191 --> 02:47:19,670
I see a hundred percent attempting
encouragement of curiosity.

2912
02:47:19,700 --> 02:47:24,620
I am getting kids to creatively solve
a problem and a dome under the ocean at

2913
02:47:24,621 --> 02:47:27,310
Dome under the ocean and you know
what? And, and when you do that,

2914
02:47:27,350 --> 02:47:28,670
but then when you,
then I should do that.

2915
02:47:28,671 --> 02:47:31,910
Then I go forward into the slides
about how we are solving the problem.

2916
02:47:32,270 --> 02:47:35,810
I can say, you know, Dave, you raised
your hand and said, use better nutrition.

2917
02:47:35,811 --> 02:47:37,850
Look at how they're using
nutrients to make it better.

2918
02:47:38,060 --> 02:47:39,890
Someone else said you control the insect.

2919
02:47:39,891 --> 02:47:43,340
Here's five ways they're controlling
the insect. It shows these kids,

2920
02:47:43,341 --> 02:47:47,480
they validate that their suspicions about
science and that their creative juices

2921
02:47:47,481 --> 02:47:49,100
that solve the problem were correct.

2922
02:47:49,130 --> 02:47:52,010
So how do you address the kid
but the dome onto the ocean?

2923
02:47:52,070 --> 02:47:54,940
What do you cause there's so many
fucking problems with that idea. Well,

2924
02:47:54,941 --> 02:47:59,060
I tell him in school, but there's a whole
photosynthesis issue. There's oxygen.

2925
02:47:59,061 --> 02:48:00,170
You'd run out of air.
Yeah,

2926
02:48:00,171 --> 02:48:02,570
there's Kranz and paint and
things in the world needs artists.

2927
02:48:02,571 --> 02:48:06,760
And I kind of can steer them that
direction. So what do you I I,

2928
02:48:06,810 --> 02:48:09,940
I'm very like Stephen King,
like the Dome Mu Three road.

2929
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:14,750
I made a whole fucking ocean garden that
way if there's ways to tie them back in.

2930
02:48:14,750 --> 02:48:15,890
But I think the whole idea is,

2931
02:48:15,891 --> 02:48:19,070
is that they're so used to their
teacher saying wrong. That,

2932
02:48:19,071 --> 02:48:22,940
here's a case where I set up a situation
around a real problem that's in their

2933
02:48:22,941 --> 02:48:23,361
state,

2934
02:48:23,361 --> 02:48:27,950
may be in their yard that allows them to
actually exercise their science muscles

2935
02:48:27,951 --> 02:48:31,130
as little kids. And I think that's
a big way we changed this. Yeah.

2936
02:48:31,131 --> 02:48:35,480
That is a really important point
when it comes to human beings,

2937
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:39,980
little children is figuring out a way
to not make their curiosity in negative,

2938
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:44,360
you know, don't scold them for having
a ridiculous imagination, you know,

2939
02:48:44,390 --> 02:48:48,680
express the issue with it
or how it could be. Right.

2940
02:48:49,070 --> 02:48:51,230
And why it's probably
wrong, you know, but,

2941
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:54,650
and you got to figure out a way to reward
them for taking that chance to come up

2942
02:48:54,651 --> 02:48:56,840
with this dome under the
ocean. Cause that, who knows,

2943
02:48:56,841 --> 02:48:58,700
that kid might have
three of those that suck,

2944
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:01,130
but one of those that everybody
goes, hey, wait a minute.

2945
02:49:01,490 --> 02:49:04,700
Well that's the paradigm shift. Goddamn
point. Yeah. That's what we want.

2946
02:49:04,701 --> 02:49:08,610
And there's a great video,
a great ted talk by named Alison Gopnik

2947
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:11,400
and Alison, I forget where
she's at, maybe Berkeley.

2948
02:49:11,610 --> 02:49:16,610
She is a a scientist who studies the way
kids think and she shows that children

2949
02:49:16,830 --> 02:49:19,710
when they're born and through the next
few months are actually the smartest

2950
02:49:19,711 --> 02:49:23,640
they've ever going to be in terms of
their ability to test hypotheses and

2951
02:49:23,641 --> 02:49:28,290
synthesize information. And she shows
the way kids do this. And so, uh,

2952
02:49:28,820 --> 02:49:31,890
that maybe I don't want to be like an
indictment of the way we train people,

2953
02:49:31,891 --> 02:49:36,891
but there's a certain amount of curiosity
and exploration that we tend to break

2954
02:49:38,041 --> 02:49:41,910
out a kids. And I think,
um, as, as an educator,

2955
02:49:41,911 --> 02:49:44,190
as someone who was really
committed to education,

2956
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:48,210
that getting to kids is the most
important way to get science to improve,

2957
02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:51,960
get them so excited about the
cool things we can do. And uh,

2958
02:49:52,110 --> 02:49:56,180
it breaks my heart when I have a kid show
up at the march against Monsanto who's

2959
02:49:56,210 --> 02:49:59,310
holding a sign saying,
your science causes autism.

2960
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:01,290
It doesn't.

2961
02:50:01,291 --> 02:50:04,470
And here's a kid who's going to now go
through life thinking science is evil and

2962
02:50:04,471 --> 02:50:09,010
done by evil people with evil
intentions. When, uh, when really we're,

2963
02:50:09,011 --> 02:50:12,960
we're trying to get that kid may hold the
solution to the next big citrus crisis.

2964
02:50:13,050 --> 02:50:13,481
Yeah.
It's,

2965
02:50:13,481 --> 02:50:18,481
it's unbelievably ironic that so many
anti-science websites are online.

2966
02:50:19,470 --> 02:50:20,850
I mean,
just the idea.

2967
02:50:22,380 --> 02:50:26,640
How the fuck do you think that computer
got built on? Exactly. All natural,

2968
02:50:26,940 --> 02:50:28,110
all natural is an apple.

2969
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:32,190
This is not an all natural computer
you're typing as recipe through. It's, um,

2970
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:32,700
yeah,

2971
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:37,410
I think it's really important that people
recognize that science has brought us

2972
02:50:37,411 --> 02:50:40,650
virtually every single thing
that you enjoy today, uh,

2973
02:50:40,651 --> 02:50:44,250
outside of the natural world outside
of coconuts falling and you eat them.

2974
02:50:44,370 --> 02:50:45,151
You know,
there's,

2975
02:50:45,151 --> 02:50:50,151
there's so much that we have relied
on science about the way we stay warm,

2976
02:50:50,761 --> 02:50:54,300
the way we keep things cool,
the way we communicate with each other.

2977
02:50:54,750 --> 02:50:59,070
And this fear that people have
about foods being modified,

2978
02:50:59,071 --> 02:51:03,780
I think is, it's, it's a big one and it's
one of the biggest ones in this country.

2979
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:08,580
And so to have a guy like you come on and
express why we should be concerned and

2980
02:51:08,581 --> 02:51:12,000
why we shouldn't be concerned. And why,
what, what the positive aspects of our,

2981
02:51:12,001 --> 02:51:13,860
I think, I think it's really,
really important, man.

2982
02:51:14,220 --> 02:51:17,130
I think a lot of people need to hear
what you have to say and they need to be

2983
02:51:17,131 --> 02:51:21,630
able to listen to it from an objective
standpoint and understand that this is a

2984
02:51:21,631 --> 02:51:24,840
very complex issue. It's a very
complex and it's very important.

2985
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:26,041
I appreciate that.

2986
02:51:26,041 --> 02:51:29,700
We'd have time to talk about it because
it's something that I really encourage

2987
02:51:29,701 --> 02:51:33,150
people. There's places where
you can get great resources. Um,

2988
02:51:33,210 --> 02:51:38,210
there's a blog called biofortified.org
which is written by scientists who are

2989
02:51:38,281 --> 02:51:41,670
independent scientists and it really
is just an information hub about this

2990
02:51:41,671 --> 02:51:45,810
particular topic. And, uh, some of
the articles are, articles are clever.

2991
02:51:46,320 --> 02:51:48,750
They're all written very softly.
There nothing is, you know,

2992
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:53,180
[inaudible] it's all really about
the science and it's independent.

2993
02:51:53,181 --> 02:51:54,900
It's not funded by any of the companies.

2994
02:51:55,030 --> 02:51:57,850
Have you ever thought about doing a
podcast cause you'd be excellent at it?

2995
02:51:57,880 --> 02:52:01,640
I would love to do it. There's some
funny things about that. Um, uh,

2996
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:04,750
he can't talk about anti podcast
clause and your university contract or

2997
02:52:04,751 --> 02:52:06,340
something. No, I have a podcast.

2998
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:09,490
I do, but I don't do it as
me. Oh, you son of a bitch.

2999
02:52:09,700 --> 02:52:13,870
I do it as I do it as a character.
And it was no dare you,

3000
02:52:14,310 --> 02:52:16,470
you can't talk about it.
And I can't talk about it because,

3001
02:52:17,170 --> 02:52:20,110
did you mention it for them? They're
going to find it. They're gonna find it.

3002
02:52:20,111 --> 02:52:23,320
And I guess the problem is, is that
wants things from me. I know what the,

3003
02:52:23,410 --> 02:52:27,250
once the cat's out of the bag,
the funny part is, that's too bad.

3004
02:52:27,910 --> 02:52:31,090
The reason I wanted to keep it secret
though, and maybe here's my appeal to,

3005
02:52:31,091 --> 02:52:33,100
don't go look for it. Okay.
But it's still secret.

3006
02:52:33,101 --> 02:52:37,690
What's it about science and you're a
character on a science podcast. Yeah.

3007
02:52:37,910 --> 02:52:40,390
Ooh, I'm a moderator who taught
him. They're gonna know that.

3008
02:52:40,391 --> 02:52:43,010
And I guess I'll figure it out, but
I'll keep it going anyway. I mean,

3009
02:52:43,290 --> 02:52:44,500
keep it going.
Don't admit to it,

3010
02:52:44,501 --> 02:52:47,830
no matter what Colbert did it for
how many years, you know? So, uh,

3011
02:52:48,110 --> 02:52:51,790
and it's very much along that line. It's
very much along that line. It's a, it's,

3012
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:55,330
it's a lot of fun talking about the
play a dummy or a smart guy, uh,

3013
02:52:55,340 --> 02:52:57,040
a dumb smart guy.
Oh,

3014
02:52:57,070 --> 02:53:00,100
so you play a guy who doesn't understand
the science and you have to correct

3015
02:53:00,130 --> 02:53:03,100
people or they have to correct
you. Is that what happened?
Or something like that.

3016
02:53:03,101 --> 02:53:07,750
So you played the antagonists and so
they come along and then they have to use

3017
02:53:07,870 --> 02:53:10,240
you as a tool to get to
the root of the problem,

3018
02:53:10,241 --> 02:53:12,340
the ignorance of people that
was signed essentially. Yes.

3019
02:53:12,341 --> 02:53:15,560
And then some stuff that's completely
off the wall and it's, but it's, it's,

3020
02:53:15,570 --> 02:53:18,580
it's really fun because it's a great
way to get the science out there and it

3021
02:53:18,581 --> 02:53:21,310
allows me to have some fun as a, uh, as,

3022
02:53:21,790 --> 02:53:24,670
as a character that I couldn't have as a,
uh,

3023
02:53:24,820 --> 02:53:28,600
established professor and chairman
of, of, of a, of a department.

3024
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:33,250
Totally understood. Yeah. That also
is now linked to a great song online.

3025
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:37,980
Well, you need his rapper name, you know
how yams have their own separate name.

3026
02:53:38,190 --> 02:53:41,350
It'd be Yam. And then they have the other
thing. You need a rapper named dude.

3027
02:53:41,440 --> 02:53:45,190
Yeah, I do have one. I like, what is it?
Write it down. I'm not going to say it.

3028
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:49,120
I hope it's like Kaiser San Jose. Most
things are, it's one, it's one better.

3029
02:53:49,121 --> 02:53:53,080
You can even, you can even look it
up online here. Okay. That's it.

3030
02:53:53,110 --> 02:53:57,310
I can't talk about that. Don't talk.
It just doesn't violate your trust.

3031
02:53:57,311 --> 02:53:59,050
I think it's good because the thing is,

3032
02:53:59,051 --> 02:54:02,830
is that I do want to talk to people who
don't agree with, um, technology. Well,

3033
02:54:02,831 --> 02:54:06,700
why don't you do this?
Why don't you have a podcast where people,

3034
02:54:06,701 --> 02:54:10,990
instead of like you've seen you, I've
seen rather you spend so much time typing.

3035
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:14,470
I'm sure you can type or you can talk
while they're quicker than you can type

3036
02:54:14,471 --> 02:54:15,304
all that shit out.

3037
02:54:15,370 --> 02:54:18,160
So why don't you just take those
questions and have people send them to you

3038
02:54:18,161 --> 02:54:21,820
every week. And if they're not
redundant, just that way you can choose,

3039
02:54:21,821 --> 02:54:24,130
you know what you've already
dressed and you could say, hey,

3040
02:54:24,280 --> 02:54:27,070
we covered that in podcast two or three.

3041
02:54:27,280 --> 02:54:31,120
You would have a kick ass podcast man,
I'd be happy to support it too. Well,

3042
02:54:31,121 --> 02:54:33,820
why don't we, why don't we talk about
that and I always so easy to do.

3043
02:54:33,821 --> 02:54:35,400
The one I wanted to do was the uh,

3044
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:39,310
crop domestication podcast where I talked
about finally someone's doing that.

3045
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:41,080
I wanted to know the
one we talk about this,

3046
02:54:41,081 --> 02:54:42,620
the strawberries and the yams house stuff.

3047
02:54:42,790 --> 02:54:46,390
I wanted to talk about each one of
their stories and how they came to be an

3048
02:54:46,510 --> 02:54:49,060
interview,
the experts and so great idea and it,

3049
02:54:49,061 --> 02:54:50,800
and so all these things
are kicking around.

3050
02:54:50,800 --> 02:54:55,630
The problem is is I have three full time
jobs. I mean I'm an administrator, um,

3051
02:54:55,631 --> 02:54:57,460
for a department of 59 faculty.

3052
02:54:57,461 --> 02:55:01,300
I'm a full time research scientist and
I'm a full time science communicator.

3053
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:06,580
And so, um, I literally do work 6:00 AM
to midnight seven days a week. And uh,

3054
02:55:06,640 --> 02:55:11,510
and except for exercise time, you know,
the stuff I do there I am, uh, I'm,

3055
02:55:11,570 --> 02:55:13,280
I'm in this,
what are you hiding from?

3056
02:55:13,310 --> 02:55:17,240
What are you running from running from
something? No, I don't know. I guess.

3057
02:55:17,241 --> 02:55:20,200
I think a lot of work, I guess I guess
when I'm running from is uh, I'm, I'm,

3058
02:55:20,201 --> 02:55:21,610
I'm running from,
um,

3059
02:55:21,710 --> 02:55:25,220
I'm waiting for one of these things to
wear out where I can just cut it back to

3060
02:55:25,280 --> 02:55:26,030
two.

3061
02:55:26,030 --> 02:55:29,120
That's an amazing work ethic that you
have and I can understand why you wouldn't

3062
02:55:29,121 --> 02:55:31,340
have enough time, but if you have
enough time to do all these tweets,

3063
02:55:31,341 --> 02:55:34,040
I'm saying even if he just did a
half an hour once a week. Yeah.

3064
02:55:34,090 --> 02:55:35,900
If you just for a half
an hour once a week,

3065
02:55:35,901 --> 02:55:39,440
just got a collection of maybe you can
get an intern to collect some of the best

3066
02:55:39,441 --> 02:55:43,370
questions. I'm sure somebody be happy to
do that. You press record on an iPhone,

3067
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:44,960
that's all you need to
do. I mean, the, the,

3068
02:55:44,961 --> 02:55:49,370
the quality of the recording you get from
a regular iPhone is pretty much worth

3069
02:55:49,371 --> 02:55:49,670
it.

3070
02:55:49,670 --> 02:55:52,790
You can hold it up to your mouth and just
go over the piece of people could hear

3071
02:55:52,791 --> 02:55:55,040
you turn the paper. Okay. What
do we got here? Okay. This one,

3072
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:58,730
this is important and just ramble into
the microphone and I'm telling you it

3073
02:55:58,731 --> 02:56:01,820
would be popular as fuck and you'd be able
to quit your other jobs. None of that.

3074
02:56:01,821 --> 02:56:05,530
And that works great. Actually, I have
used the iPhone in my character issues dot

3075
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:09,680
and a, and they got a nice
mixer at home. I pumped,

3076
02:56:09,681 --> 02:56:11,840
punch it through the mixer so
you know how to do this stuff.

3077
02:56:11,841 --> 02:56:14,100
This is all second nature. I mean,
I used to be in a band, you know.

3078
02:56:14,170 --> 02:56:18,560
Oh that's right. I know. But I imagine
there's a couple things I would,

3079
02:56:18,561 --> 02:56:20,360
and I love doing this kind of media stuff.

3080
02:56:20,390 --> 02:56:22,430
It would be a really
easy thing for me to do.

3081
02:56:22,431 --> 02:56:24,860
It's just a question of where to
wedge it into a full schedule.

3082
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:26,540
You really gotta try it.
You really,

3083
02:56:26,541 --> 02:56:29,090
I think you'd be excellent on it cause
you're were really great today. I really,

3084
02:56:29,150 --> 02:56:32,090
really appreciate talking to you. Do you
ever feel like moving out of Florida?

3085
02:56:32,091 --> 02:56:37,060
Cause it's too stupid. Um, you
know it the first be honest. No, I,

3086
02:56:37,061 --> 02:56:41,240
I, I, I've actually, I really love
Florida. I really it, you know why though?

3087
02:56:41,750 --> 02:56:44,940
But it's my job that does it. I
never planned on being there. Um,

3088
02:56:44,950 --> 02:56:47,870
I only Gainesville, yes. I used
to live in Gainesville. Yeah.

3089
02:56:47,871 --> 02:56:49,940
My Dad went to the University of
Florida. I didn't know that. Yeah.

3090
02:56:49,941 --> 02:56:53,500
My stepdad went there for
architecture or something. Well, I,

3091
02:56:53,510 --> 02:56:57,560
I totally admire the faculty there and
when I had the opportunity to apply there,

3092
02:56:58,040 --> 02:57:00,950
I applied and thinking there's
no way I'll ever get the call.

3093
02:57:01,490 --> 02:57:04,100
And I got the interview and then
I interviewed and I thought,

3094
02:57:04,190 --> 02:57:07,760
there's no way I'll ever get the job.
And then when they called me for the job,

3095
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:11,450
um, you know, I showed up and I,
I've always felt like the, uh,

3096
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:15,200
the guy on the all star team who just
gets to put on the team because he's,

3097
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:17,990
you know, the, uh, his team didn't
have anybody else. I, you know,

3098
02:57:17,991 --> 02:57:22,660
I'm so surrounded by good people. I always
feel very dwarfed there. But, um, uh,

3099
02:57:22,730 --> 02:57:25,730
12 years later, they are, 10 years
later they put me in charge of it.

3100
02:57:26,150 --> 02:57:30,350
So I must be doing something right. But
you obviously have a real passion for it.

3101
02:57:30,650 --> 02:57:32,570
And like I said,
you're in Florida.

3102
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:36,020
You got to be the smartest guy in Florida
by far. It's you and Billy Corbin.

3103
02:57:36,021 --> 02:57:38,050
She get together.
He would dominate Florida level.

3104
02:57:38,080 --> 02:57:41,780
He is the director of cocaine cowboys.
I don't know him. He's awesome.

3105
02:57:41,810 --> 02:57:44,660
I thought you meant the smashing
pump. No, no, no, no, no.

3106
02:57:44,830 --> 02:57:48,710
The thing in Florida is every time the
news story breaks about, you know, the,

3107
02:57:48,720 --> 02:57:53,510
the guy having relations with a sandwich
or you know, uh, Florida, I go home.

3108
02:57:53,530 --> 02:57:55,300
Please don't be here.
Please don't be a thing.

3109
02:57:55,490 --> 02:57:57,950
If you've ever seen the Florida
man Twitter account, no.

3110
02:57:58,010 --> 02:58:00,380
One of the greatest fucking things
the world's ever known. Okay,

3111
02:58:00,381 --> 02:58:01,530
I'll watch your spare time.

3112
02:58:01,530 --> 02:58:06,530
Go to the Florida man Twitter feed and
just read like fucking crazy how many

3113
02:58:07,291 --> 02:58:11,790
morons or are in Florida. Yeah. It's
all true. I mean, I, you know, I, I,

3114
02:58:11,940 --> 02:58:15,420
I have a great relationship
with the growers in our
state and the people who are

3115
02:58:15,421 --> 02:58:17,900
doing the farming and the
people in those industries.

3116
02:58:17,910 --> 02:58:20,520
There's a lot of great people in Florida.
Don't get me wrong. No, no, I'm not.

3117
02:58:20,521 --> 02:58:22,470
But there's a lot of morons too.
Absolutely.

3118
02:58:22,600 --> 02:58:24,230
I'm on the morons in California and that,

3119
02:58:24,260 --> 02:58:27,240
but that's why it would be hard to
pull me away is because you develop

3120
02:58:27,241 --> 02:58:31,020
relationships with these people who are,
who are seriously struggling.

3121
02:58:31,021 --> 02:58:34,230
And you look at the citrus
industry, strawberry industry, um,

3122
02:58:34,231 --> 02:58:36,390
with the competition they're
getting is unprecedented.

3123
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:41,720
And these are folks down the highway
who are farming to feed us good food and

3124
02:58:42,481 --> 02:58:44,130
doing everything they can to stay afloat.

3125
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:47,520
And I am so glad that to be all
the work with them, Kevin Fault.

3126
02:58:47,521 --> 02:58:50,830
But thank you very much. And please
do a God damn podcast where you serve.

3127
02:58:51,220 --> 02:58:52,290
These people would love it.

3128
02:58:52,470 --> 02:58:55,050
I think you could help a lot of people
by answering a lot of questions like you

3129
02:58:55,051 --> 02:58:57,830
did today. You were fantastic. I
appreciate the hell out of you, man.

3130
02:58:57,860 --> 02:59:00,720
Don't do it very, very much. People.
You can follow him on Twitter.

3131
02:59:00,721 --> 02:59:03,810
It's Kevin Folta,
f o l t a on Twitter.

Your website is k Folta at blog spot.
It's a blog called illumination.

3133
02:59:08,490 --> 02:59:11,430
Beautiful. Is there a link to that
from your Twitter feed? Um, but yeah,

3134
02:59:11,431 --> 02:59:14,040
just somewhere in there. Okay. Okay. All
Right, ladies and gentlemen. That's it.

3135
02:59:14,041 --> 02:59:15,240
Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Big Cast.

3136
02:59:15,450 --> 02:59:15,850
All right.
