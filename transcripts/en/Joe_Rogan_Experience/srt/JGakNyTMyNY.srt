1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,200
Our screens,
let's fucking talk like people.

2
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:03,910
Man,
let's do this.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,300
Ah,

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,040
we're allowed you motherfuckers.
We're live.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,570
Happy Birthday Joe.
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:14,890
Brian.
Happy Birthday.

7
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:16,810
Whenever you're less birthday was 
athlete.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,200
I missed it.
Yeah.

9
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:23,680
I don't like it anymore.
Once you hit 30 it's not cool anymore,

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,390
but when you hit 42,
it's just like.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,120
I'm like looking at every time somebody 
dies,

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,810
I'm like,
how old are they?

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,370
40 eight on my gut.
Well,

14
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:31,920
he is fatter than me,
so I'm good.

15
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,250
Yeah.
I was looking at this,

16
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:35,300
um,
someone's post on instagram.

17
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:35,410
Okay.

18
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,700
Like a friend of a friend.
I went instagram hopping.

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,530
You know how you go from one person's 
page?

20
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:41,710
You see someone comments?
Something funny.

21
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:42,910
Oh,
that guy got to say.

22
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,190
And you go to his page and uh,
it was a guy talking about his wife's 

23
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,570
brother had died and he had been 
suffering with.

24
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:52,700
Is it you've battled his demons?
Was the quote

25
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,730
six?
I was like,

26
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,450
oh Jesus Christ.
40 six.

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,370
Like people are just fucking dying.
Yeah.

28
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,650
The ones that get me the worst,
it's the ones that like,

29
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,490
he just died in his sleep.
Oh yeah,

30
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:07,480
man.
Patton,

31
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,680
Oswalt's wife.
Yeah.

32
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,970
Yeah.
Did it ever come out?

33
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:12,960
What happened to her or do not know?
I do not know.

34
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,660
So sad.

35
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,690
But you know,
we all,

36
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:17,980
uh,
we all will go.

37
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,180
Allegedly Bert Kreischer doesn't believe
it for a car.

38
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,230
She goes,
I don't think we are.

39
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,400
I go,
what do you mean proofread on?

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,120
You want me to kill you?
Like what do you want me to do?

41
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,850
We haven't previewed die.
I know people,

42
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,800
they're not around anymore.
They,

43
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,000
they,
they died.

44
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,330
So my,
as opposed to just pretend they're not 

45
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,140
just not in this space,
but they're in another space and in that

46
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:44,220
space I'm there too.
And they went through a portal or what?

47
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,920
We had them on a kill Tony a couple days
ago and he was on this like weird pill.

48
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,350
He took this weird pill and he says that
he's like,

49
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,300
he fucks with my blood pressure though.
Like if I laugh too hard I'll just faint

50
00:01:56,301 --> 00:02:01,301
and pass out.
It's happened three times already so I 

51
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:01,301
might pass it.
I'm like,

52
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:01,301
wait,
you're going,

53
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,000
you shouldn't not be famous.

54
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,720
Hey,
your brain is shutting off.

55
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,610
Your brain is like too much.
We're done.

56
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,000
Funk.
Oh,

57
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,680
you know,
they say that's what happened to Hillary

58
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,420
Clinton,
that she blacked out.

59
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:21,421
She fainted and hit her head in 2012.
There's all these concerns that people 

60
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:23,200
have.
I don't know if they're there.

61
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,330
They're founded in any fact,
but apparently the.

62
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,210
The real incident did happen that she 
fell down.

63
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:36,211
She,
she blacked out and fell down and hit 

64
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:36,970
her head and had a clot,
which can be pretty serious,

65
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,420
but there's an of course because of 
that,

66
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:45,421
there's people that are making all these
crazy videos speculating that she has 

67
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,830
brain damage and she's out of her mind 
that she's like super unhealthy.

68
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,150
Yeah.
Like there's.

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,030
See they'd taken these compilations of 
her,

70
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,150
you know,
look,

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,200
she's doing hundreds and hundreds and 
hundreds and hundreds of fucking 

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,860
interviews like this where people are 
talking to her and

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,390
you know,
it's,

74
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,900
it probably becomes mind numbing after 
a.

75
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,160
It looks like she's having fun to me.
She's laughing,

76
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:11,161
she's bombed her head up and down and 
they're saying that she's acting 

77
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:15,031
bizarre.
I think she's a person who's dealing 

78
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:15,031
with massive,
massive amounts of stress.

79
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:19,640
I mean,
I'm not necessarily a big fan of what 

80
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,631
she represents other than I think it's 
Kinda cool that there's going to be a 

81
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:22,780
first chick that's a president,
I think.

82
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:25,930
I think it was good to have a first 
black president as much as A.

83
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,670
People didn't think that that was a,
you know,

84
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,550
like important.
It was important.

85
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,890
Socially it's important.
It's important.

86
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,530
Like having a chick president would be 
interesting.

87
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,330
It'd be interesting.
I'd like to see where it goes.

88
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,280
The problem with her is she represents 
like the oldest form of government.

89
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,260
She's like,
do you remember that movie?

90
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,730
Um,
what was the fucking movie where there 

91
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,790
were the elder vampires?
You know what I'm talking about?

92
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,410
Like there was the Oh,
blade,

93
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,930
the movie blade,
right where they were the ones that were

94
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,170
turned into vampires.
And then there was the old ones who are 

95
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,290
born vampires.
There were natural born vampires.

96
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:10,291
Right.
And they didn't like blade because he 

97
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:10,920
was half human and he was,
you know,

98
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,010
he was made

99
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,710
day Walker.
He said,

100
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,850
well,
he was a day walker because he was half 

101
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:18,850
human.
He could.

102
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,380
He could hang around a daytime.
I still maintain that first fucking 

103
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,110
movie,
that first blade movies.

104
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:23,910
One of my all time favorite comic book 
movies.

105
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,470
Have you ever watched it lately?
No.

106
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,070
I'm not going to do it.
Either breaks and everything's breaking.

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,360
No,
I'm not going.

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm not gonna Watch us and one of my all
time favorite comic book movies.

109
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:36,570
I fucking loved that movie,
but that was the thing.

110
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,810
So Hillary Clinton's like,
she's one of those born vampires.

111
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,840
She murders murders a lot of people is 
what you're saying?

112
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,330
I'm not saying she merged a lot of 
people.

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,230
I'm saying people that get into conflict
with her wind up dead as fuck,

114
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:49,700
right.
Whatever.

115
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,610
Are we what?
Jamie?

116
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,890
What number are we on now?
It's 49,

117
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,210
right?
I think up to somewhere,

118
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,550
as the Internet says it's up to 49,
but now

119
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,410
coincidence or is this evidence like 
when we look at an evidence or or is 

120
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:08,441
this just will look at what these people
are doing and the last guy seemed to be 

121
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,750
like a robbery attempt or something like
that because it was 4:00

122
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:16,751
in the morning.
He got shot walking down the street and 

123
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,410
Washington like know Washington's a 
notoriously dangerous place.

124
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,860
Me and barrier got elected after he got 
arrested,

125
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:24,980
went to jail for crack.
He then he got elected again.

126
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,060
That's true.
That's true.

127
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:33,061
Right?
And it's a beehive for crazy people 

128
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:33,061
because anyone that likes government.
Look,

129
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,240
the guy that climbed trump tower,
he's a crazy person.

130
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:39,241
Who,
if you saw his interview he talking 

131
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:39,241
about yesterday,
they don't know.

132
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,930
You didn't hear about this.
Oh my God.

133
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,030
This was like the biggest thing for like
three hours.

134
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:46,000
This guy was suction cups,
climbing the trump tower.

135
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,230
Like,
like police busting windows out of 

136
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,230
trump's windows,
like trying to grab and get.

137
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,120
Couldn't get him.
He kept on climbing.

138
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,110
He released the guy released a video 
like 12 hours before Sam,

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
and if you listen to the video,
it sounds like

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,670
a youtube commentor like it.
It's just like,

141
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,950
like I want to give a mess appearance.
I just don't know how many people will 

142
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:09,980
walk this.
I'd rather not be recognizable.

143
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm an independent researcher.
We're good.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,330
I've had my fill,
but it was pretty intense because he got

145
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:22,331
up pretty high and could for awhile.
I didn't think the police were going to 

146
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,440
be able to do anything but watching them
work in their,

147
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,390
their tactics to catch a guy that has 
suction cups,

148
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,740
cups.
Very interesting.

149
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,790
This is when they pull him in and he,
he means stone.

150
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,830
It's like right here at me and he's.
But he's still connected to the rope.

151
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,630
There's probably beating the fuck out of
here it is.

152
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,910
Dick's getting together,
trying to undo them.

153
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,640
They're just going to cut it.
No,

154
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:46,880
they ended up pulling it off somehow.
But they destroyed that,

155
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,750
that,
that building.

156
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,170
They broke a lot of windows.
Cut a lot of like crates or uh,

157
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,410
air conditioning.
What a crazy fucker.

158
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,380
Yeah.
It not what happens to a guy like that.

159
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,690
How long you go to jail for.
Wow.

160
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,540
I don't know that.
So I think that's a.

161
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,700
whilst the charges today,
I was going to look at that second.

162
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I think mental,
he's gonna be in a mental hospital more 

163
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,760
so than a a,
a jail it seems like,

164
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,890
but these kind of people or the people 
that hang out in like Washington DC and 

165
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,361
stuff.
That's why DC or Washington so a so 

166
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:19,361
dangerous,
you know,

167
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:23,441
it's,
it's because they're attracted to this 

168
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:23,441
crazy thing that's already happening.

169
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:28,250
A hive of government and everybody knows
it's got to a centralized location 

170
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,330
because the hive,
Washington DC's the hive of our 

171
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,860
government and the penthouse is a or the
Pentagon.

172
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,760
Penthouse.
The Pentagon is not that far from there.

173
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,170
Right.
How far is that?

174
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,390
It's in Virginia,
right?

175
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,260
How far by air is the Pentagon or the 
White House?

176
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah,
they're fairly close to each other,

177
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,730
right?
Probably be like a 12 hour drive.

178
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,910
Something like that I guess isn't.
I don't know that whole area though.

179
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:57,030
I would imagine.
And there's also that giant community of

180
00:07:57,031 --> 00:08:02,031
lobbyists that lives in Virginia just 
outside of Washington dc that,

181
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:07,101
uh,
Brian Cowen was telling me some of the 

182
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:07,110
richest people per capita in the 
country,

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,740
right?
Pc Cemetery.

184
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,230
It's just across the river from.
And I'm pretty sure it was pretty close.

185
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,940
Oh Wow.
I was way off.

186
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,640
I had no idea it was that close to all 
of our driver.

187
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,270
It's a 12 minute walk from the Pentagon.
I mean,

188
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,070
it's just literally really across the 
river.

189
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:24,680
Holy Shit.

190
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,200
I thought it was more like a half hour 
away in bad traffic.

191
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,640
But yeah,
maybe that's what it is.

192
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,790
I thought it was like a over the river 
and through the woods to grandmother's 

193
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:35,860
house.
We go.

194
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,160
It's close as fuck.
So the point being that that's a,

195
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,490
that's a hub.
So that one last guy that got shot,

196
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,820
man,
anybody who get shot in Washington DC 

197
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:47,820
walking around the street at 4:00
in the morning and get shot,

198
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,050
it can happen.
You can zig zagged.

199
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,570
You could rock it to the wrong dude at 
the wrong time.

200
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,250
And it can happen.
It's just part of living in a high crime

201
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,050
area,
so who knows if that one was,

202
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,200
but there's a gang of them that are 
connected to the Clintons that just 

203
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,420
wound them getting whacked.

204
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,430
Did you see all the crime that's been 
going on in the Olympics?

205
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:11,431
Like I sent Jamie this video of in 
Brazil and it's just a collection of 

206
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:15,601
like the first or second day of the.
They have like these people just 

207
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:19,501
watching the streets for crime and it's 
just tons of these petty theft like 

208
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,720
people getting,
trying to just steal people's stuff and 

209
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,441
this video,
I mean this came out I think the first 

210
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:28,441
or second day,
but this video is nonstop.

211
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:32,490
It's just happening like people just 
coming up and trying to steal people's 

212
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,510
cell phones and some guys are really 
smart with it.

213
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:37,300
They get on these bikes and you now when
you're looking at your cell phone,

214
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:40,960
you're just kind of holding it barely 
and people are just coming up and taking

215
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:43,030
their phones on bikes and then taking 
off and it's.

216
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,390
It's crazy.
This guy is the biggest pussy in the 

217
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,390
road by the way.
Right here.

218
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,800
Look how small that little kid is and he
knows like guys following him,

219
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,010
he's getting close to his girl and he's 
just not doing anything and then this 

220
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,300
kid ends up stealing something from the 
guy in front of them.

221
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,550
Wow.
Right here.

222
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,520
Blank.
Hey Man.

223
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,370
That's just taking part of the process.
Yeah.

224
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,160
Some people

225
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,560
super disenfranchise and poor and that 
was something that Byron bowers who 

226
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,910
talked about in the podcast,
the difference between people that are 

227
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,460
just trying to survive,
they're just trying to survive.

228
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:23,461
Man.
That is a totally different world that 

229
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:23,461
grow and fight at all.
She's just like,

230
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:23,461
just give it up.
Okay.

231
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,690
Um,
so how many people have supposedly been 

232
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:28,690
whacked?

233
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,610
What does the Internet believe?
I think it was 49.

234
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,320
Oh,
I got to find the.

235
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,210
But is there anybody that makes a 
compelling case?

236
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,650
It says 96.
Right?

237
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,990
I don't know if that's.
I mean it depends on which website you 

238
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:46,990
want to look up and find who was 
conspiracy.

239
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,070
Do you want to dig down?
It's on snoopy's or snopes?

240
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,160
No.
Here's what one of the weirdest things 

241
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,871
about government is that it affects all 
of us right in this room,

242
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,330
but we couldn't be further away from the
type of person that would want to run 

243
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,410
the government.
Like I don't want to run shit.

244
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,420
You don't want to run shit.
You know,

245
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,760
like the type of people that do want to 
do that.

246
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,300
They are so not like most people.
Most people do not want to run 

247
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,741
everybody.
When you get people that are in that 

248
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:22,231
like higher echelon of government and 
they have the ability literally to 

249
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:27,241
manipulate which way the country thinks 
that without really persuasive,

250
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,110
articulate speech,
they really have the opportunity to 

251
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,920
change the way the country feels about 
itself.

252
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:36,940
You know,
like,

253
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,330
like Kennedy,
like his summer Kennedy's speeches.

254
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,640
You would,
you would listen to them and you would 

255
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,100
want to be a better person.
You hear that guy talk and he,

256
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:52,101
he said such poetic shit.
It was so brilliant and the way he was 

257
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:54,010
able to communicate and a

258
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,010
lot of blase,
like a lot of people thought Obama was 

259
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,101
going to be like that too because it 
seemed like he kind of was when he was 

260
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:03,310
running for office and we seemed like 
when this guy gets in,

261
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:04,840
man,
he's going to make some of those Kennedy

262
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:08,440
type speeches and he made some really 
good speeches for sure,

263
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,230
but it always felt like he was.
Everything was down the middle,

264
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,460
like everything was like a 90 Sitcom,
you know?

265
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,950
It's like there was not much chances 
being taken.

266
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,270
It was like you wanted Seinfeld and you 
got mad about you.

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,770
You know what I mean?

268
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,420
You know what I'm saying?
Not that there's anything wrong with mad

269
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:33,421
about you.
So fine program went along on a long 

270
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:33,421
time.
A lot of people enjoyed it,

271
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,510
you know,
but it wasn't curb your enthusiasm.

272
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,260
You know,
there's,

273
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:36,160
there's,
there's,

274
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,640
when,
when a guy comes out like Obama and his 

275
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,960
speeches at the Democratic convention 
before he was elected,

276
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,640
he was like,
Holy Shit.

277
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Like this is going to be the guy who's 
going to be this super articulate,

278
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,570
powerful,
powerful guy who writes all the wrongs,

279
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,310
so one of two options,
either one,

280
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,570
he was never really liked that and it 
was just tricking us and is brilliant.

281
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,230
Like a portrayal of this rebel of this 
person who's gonna come in and give you 

282
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,300
hope and change or two,
you get in there and the sobering effect

283
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,760
of what you're presented with every day 
makes you realize like,

284
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,790
oh my God,
they're just running around putting out 

285
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,831
fires all the time.
There's a fucking like what you're 

286
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:28,981
seeing from those kids in that video in 
the Olympics where these people are 

287
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:34,891
getting a purse snatched and shit.
Tourists are getting personality pick 

288
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:38,600
pocketed.
That is just what happens when things 

289
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,940
are all fucked up and unbalanced.
That's what happens.

290
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,080
It's just what happened.

291
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,550
That's just a whole mess.
Like do you think this is the end of the

292
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:48,300
Olympics?
Just based on like how much trouble this

293
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:50,910
Olympics has been,
you know,

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
looking at all the hotel rooms where the
sinks are falling through the counters 

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,811
and how the water.
I don't know if you saw the water today 

296
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:02,151
is green because they have an allergy 
problem or something like that and if 

297
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:05,820
you look at all the past Olympics and 
how all the structures,

298
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,260
there's a website where it shows like 
all the Olympics and how it just,

299
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:14,261
they have all these concrete things that
are just now overrun by a trees and 

300
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,290
weeds and stuff and how much it costs to
make all this and now it's just ruined 

301
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:19,290
land.
You know,

302
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,200
you can't.
Once you put concrete on land it's 

303
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,331
pretty much ruined you.
It's really hard for it to ever be 

304
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,900
farmed on again or things to grow when 
there's concrete on there.

305
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,110
Yeah,
I guess it makes sense that you'd have 

306
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,110
to look at this.
I mean this is just things apart.

307
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,850
This is old and as 1984 Olympics,
just try.

308
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,720
It looks trashy.

309
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,550
Oh,
they were using for a bike course.

310
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:38,960
So that's kind of done.
It looks fun.

311
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,670
Where's that?
Where's that?

312
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,740
Sarah Yandell.
Bosnia.

313
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:44,350
Heres A.
Hers have a golden.

314
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,110
Yeah.
How do you say that?

315
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Hers is hers.
It governing his or Grovedale is a 

316
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,560
scrolled up.
So we see that,

317
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,230
so we'll look at that man,
that looks fun as fuck.

318
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,350
These dudes are on the Bob sled run,
but it's all graffiti'd up and they're 

319
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,030
riding bikes on it.
That looks fucking bad ass man.

320
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,660
If you lived there dude.
Yeah.

321
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,920
That would be the coolest shit ever.
If you were a kid and you were growing 

322
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,310
up in that neighborhood,
but that's probably like a.

323
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,620
was probably got a lot of bullets in 
that neighborhood too.

324
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,450
It looks like.
Yeah,

325
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,840
that's what they're writing away from 
rape.

326
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,520
Like all this land,
this land is just ruined.

327
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,000
You know,
all skills and had dope though.

328
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,020
It's kind of dope right now,
but in 20 years that's going to look 

329
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,020
even shittier.
Look at that.

330
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,710
A mosquito.
That's where Zika was born probably,

331
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,960
right?
We're looking at it right now and we're.

332
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:37,961
As we're scrolling through these 
pictures for people were just listening 

333
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:40,781
to the audio.
These things were available where Jamie 

334
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:43,430
daily May I just typed in the old 
Olympic venues.

335
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:46,270
This story will pop up if you google it.
Olympic venue.

336
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,770
This one right here is not even eight 
years old from China.

337
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,450
God Damn,
this is crazy.

338
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,370
Look man,
like look at these buildings.

339
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:56,680
They're just completely deteriorating 
and falling apart here.

340
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,240
What was this?
A graveyard?

341
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,240
There's a graveyard and the site of the 
1984 Olympics.

342
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,720
So they had the side of the Olympics in 
Sarajevo and then he turned to a 

343
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,720
graveyard.

344
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,940
Hm,
okay.

345
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,870
Oh,
that looks fun.

346
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,370
To skateboard.
Yeah.

347
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:14,540
They have this crazy skin ramps ski 
jumps from 84 Olympics.

348
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,630
Wow.
This is a really fascinating man that 

349
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:19,630
we.
We do this,

350
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,330
you know,
but I'll tell you man,

351
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:25,331
they got me.
I was watching it the other day where 

352
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:25,331
you.
Yup.

353
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:25,550
They got me.
Those fuckers now have A.

354
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,120
I heard a lot of criticism of it being a
fluff piece this year.

355
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,710
A lot of people saying like,
Hey,

356
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:32,930
I don't want to look at all these 
stories that we're watching.

357
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:37,931
America's got talent.
I want us just to see sports in the 

358
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:37,931
Olympics.
Yeah,

359
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,030
there's something to that for sure.
You know,

360
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,050
they're trying to create stars and make 
a lot of money and make a lot of Michael

361
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,440
Phelps type people out of it.
The more Michael Show.

362
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

363
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,560
The more Michael Phelps people come 
along to,

364
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:53,561
the more that's going to happen,
the more you get these super successful 

365
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:53,561
guys that can.

366
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,770
They can,
you know how many limpic gold medals 

367
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,300
that guy won like 28 or something crazy 
white too.

368
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:04,301
I think you'd have to saying here's a 
crazy picture of him in the pool from 

369
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,750
this past Olympics and he swimming and 
the guy he's beating is looking at him 

370
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,611
and there was a meme that said,
this is the perfect example of losers.

371
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:17,630
Focus on winners.
Winners.

372
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,640
Winners focus on winning because he's 
like just fucking laser beam straight on

373
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,360
the target and the.
Yeah.

374
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:25,340
The guy's looking at him like,
fuck yeah,

375
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,980
I remember when that picture is so 
classic.

376
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,380
That is a man saying,
fuck.

377
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,720
I mean when I was back in the day,
believe it or not,

378
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:37,721
I was on track.
I remember winning the best tips was 

379
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:37,721
never looked back because every time he 
looked back,

380
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,710
that takes like a second off your time.
And,

381
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:41,570
and that's the same thing.
If that's what he's doing it,

382
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,320
you know,
he might not,

383
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,450
he might just be breathing and you might
be breathing,

384
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:46,820
but it certainly looks like he's looking
right at Michael Phelps.

385
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:48,920
So it's good for the narrative.

386
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,360
It's A.
It's interesting that Michael Phelps won

387
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,410
all those gold medals in swimming and 
then he became this huge swimming star 

388
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,350
because think about how many swimming 
stars I've been.

389
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,950
How many other is Greg Louganis who was 
more of a diving star that a swimming 

390
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,990
star?
Name me another famous swimmer.

391
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,170
Summer Sanders.
I don't know who the fuck that is.

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,470
She's not famous like Michael Phelps 
that even the neighborhood.

393
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,120
I've never been heard of her.
No,

394
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,770
no fence Ma'am does nickelodeon shows?
Oh,

395
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,960
she did?
Okay.

396
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,710
That's Kinda cool.
But Michael Phelps is like,

397
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,660
here's the,
here's how I feel about sports.

398
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:35,100
If I know your name,
God damn.

399
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,410
He wants to be famous because I barely 
pay attention.

400
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,130
So that's how I looked like I knew about
Michael Phelps years and years and years

401
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,810
and years ago.
So if I know about him,

402
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,900
he's got to be famous as fuck.
It's crazy that like every now and then 

403
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,560
a sport,
we'll give you a one super famous person

404
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,990
like one Lance Armstrong,
Tony Hawk,

405
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,810
and then once we got one of those,
that's it.

406
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,250
You Got Michael Phelps.
There was all these other guys that were

407
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:04,251
on a relay with him.
They didn't even mention that fucking 

408
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:04,620
Niggas over here.
Nobody cares about that guy.

409
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,040
They barely paid attention.
They just focused all on Phillips Golf.

410
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,870
Name three names and golf.
Oh,

411
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:11,040
this guy.
That's right.

412
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,630
Mark Spitz.
That's right.

413
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,810
I don't remember that guy.
He was a [inaudible] 76 Olympics I 

414
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:17,810
think.
Is that right?

415
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:22,320
It has to be.
He looks like Burt Reynolds from 

416
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,320
deliverance was 72 72.
Yeah,

417
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,590
man.
That's right.

418
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:23,760
I forgot about that guy.
Okay.

419
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:28,761
So he was the first of the um,
the superstar Michael Phelps type 

420
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,950
swimmer dudes I think before,
I want to say before Phelps came along 

421
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,591
and I really don't know,
but I think that Spitz was the guy who 

422
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:39,591
won the most gold medals up until that 
moment.

423
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:42,300
And then Phelps just fucking blew him 
out of the water.

424
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,790
Where is he now?
Um,

425
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,910
if I had to guess by the way it looks 
and an burt reynolds movie from the 

426
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,140
Nineteen Seventies.
Yeah,

427
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,460
look at him.
I hope that guy still rocks that.

428
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:58,461
Look.
I wonder if being in water more than a 

429
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:01,580
more average,
the average person is better or worse 

430
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:01,580
for your,
your skin.

431
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,241
For every.
Probably worse because chlorine is not 

432
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:05,241
good for you.
Sure.

433
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:09,500
It's not good for you.
Chlorine kills everything that's in the 

434
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,790
water,
but it also fucks with the floor of your

435
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:16,791
own skin.
Like it's not the best stuff in the 

436
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,330
world for your skin.
I mean it's sterile water.

437
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,370
What about saltwater?
That's probably better for you.

438
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,370
Yeah.
Let's say salt.

439
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:22,860
Water is better for you.
Yeah.

440
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,790
So water is interesting man,
because I can't get it in my eyes.

441
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,380
I know some people can get it in their 
eyes.

442
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:30,960
They don't have a problem with it.
I get in my eyes and fucking stings.

443
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,720
I don't know why.
Like when I go to,

444
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:34,770
uh,
the,

445
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:35,550
uh,
the beach,

446
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,670
if I get water in my eyes,
it fucking stinks.

447
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,750
Is that add to your sodium levels?
Mark Spitz wasn't even using a swim cap.

448
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,220
When you're saying in your eyes were 
stinging.

449
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:45,950
He doesn't have goggles on either.
He's got.

450
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,130
Yeah,
but I'm talking about a pool.

451
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:50,710
He swam in a pool and the ocean is where
my eyes sting.

452
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,720
But uh,
yeah.

453
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,750
Mark Spitz was old school is.
Fuck you probably swam in a flannel 

454
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,750
shirt.

455
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Those look at his body.
Short shorts have probably made from 

456
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:10,171
like red dye number nine.
They didn't do any strength and 

457
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:10,171
conditioning back there stops throwing 
me.

458
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,420
Just men in their underwear.
Jamie stop it.

459
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,640
The iconic speedo endures.
So this a go to full body on this 

460
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,200
gentlemen.
Look at his fucking body man.

461
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,220
It's like,
you mean,

462
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,970
I guess he kind of looks like an athlete
or he looks like a,

463
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:27,300
your girlfriend's brother that's staying
with her over the.

464
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,630
You know,
you get up in the morning,

465
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:30,430
you meet him for the first time.
Well how are you doing man?

466
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,960
Nice to meet you.
Oh Hey man.

467
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,540
Y'All got soap.
Like that's what he looks like.

468
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,060
He's like some,
some weird fucking dude might've worked 

469
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,770
out a couple of times in his underwear.
Like,

470
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:46,771
why are you just standing your in your 
underwear like that dude with gold 

471
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,400
chains around your neck?
This is a fucking strange picture.

472
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,990
It doesn't really look to swimmer body 
either.

473
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Like the difference between that body 
and Michael Phelps body or any swimmer 

474
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,220
nowadays.
It's like pretty different.

475
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,130
Like his legs actually seemed kind of 
Chubby.

476
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:00,730
They're like,
uh.

477
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,370
I don't know.
They don't really seem muscular.

478
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:07,550
They kind of seem sexy,
but what I'm just strengthened.

479
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,060
But does Michael Phelps do strength and 
conditioning workouts?

480
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,020
I know he does that crazy cupping shit.
You're paying attention to that?

481
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,930
Yeah.
Everybody's copying these days.

482
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,500
He's wacky.
Kids saw that and that.

483
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,950
That falls into the chiropractor.
Bullshit stuff,

484
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:25,951
right?
Like the like there's real no science 

485
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:26,350
behind it at all.
I've just anecdotal evidence.

486
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,650
There's no,
I don't think there's been scientific 

487
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:31,650
studies done on unfortunately.
Oh,

488
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,750
here's a breakdown of his training.
Routine warmup with Jack Knife crunches,

489
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:39,751
three sets of 20 pushups,
three tests of 25 to 35 and bodyweight 

490
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:43,590
squats,
three sets of 25 begin the pool with 40 

491
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,590
50 meter drills.

492
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,210
So it's mostly swimming stuff,
which seems like in some body weight 

493
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:50,380
exercises,
crunches and squats,

494
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:52,720
but the majority of his stuff is about 
lapse.

495
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,150
High intensity swim distances of 200 
meters,

496
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:56,430
150 meters,
100 meters,

497
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,440
50 meters with 30 seconds of rest in 
between each interval.

498
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,880
He's a fucking animal.
Just think about doing that sprints with

499
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:06,730
high intensity.
What is a high intensity to the greatest

500
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:11,731
swimmer of the world's ever known?
Can you even imagine operating those 

501
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:14,550
Rpms that he considered high intensity 
when that fucking guy gets going in a 

502
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,310
pool,
dude,

503
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,090
get video of him getting super-intense,
getting warmed up for his race the other

504
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:20,320
day.
No,

505
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,510
I didn't say it.
It's kind of funny.

506
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:23,800
The Dude's dancing around in front of 
them.

507
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,550
It's fast.
Yeah.

508
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,590
He's a beast.
You've got to be.

509
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,300
You have to have like an insanely 
powerful mind to be able to do something

510
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:38,920
that everybody can do like swim and do 
it faster than anybody ever.

511
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,540
You got to be a fucking real super 
focused psycho mean psycho in a bad way.

512
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,270
Oh,
he looks like a psycho.

513
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,570
I mean,
that death stare he did fucking crazy.

514
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,790
So this is him.
Michael Phelps.

515
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,110
What does it say?
Stairs.

516
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,750
A death stare of intimidation is going 
viral.

517
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,730
Oh,
this is like some compilation with a 

518
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:05,730
talking head person.
What,

519
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,570
what is the youtube thing where they,
they edit every five seconds.

520
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,160
You say something,
say something.

521
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,450
Edit.
And it's like constantly.

522
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,160
There's no,
there's no,

523
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,950
there's no normal talking.
It's like you're on speed.

524
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:19,520
Adhd for today's millennials.
Started with natural born killers.

525
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,930
So one guy is like dancing,
like he's not even dancing.

526
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:27,020
He's like shadow boxing.
Is that going to have fighter team?

527
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,170
South America?
Why is he staring at Michael Phelps?

528
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,590
And he's just showing off for him.
Like he's like shaking in front of them 

529
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,760
and laughing.
Michael Phelps does not give a fuck.

530
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,230
He's probably happy that guy's doing 
that.

531
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,450
You know,
it's a little test,

532
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,530
a little test for him to uh,
just continuous stare of death.

533
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,480
Whoa.
That's pretty funny man.

534
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,690
He's probably listening to some killer 
creed music or something.

535
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:55,010
And His earphones because Michael Phelps
listened to my dad.

536
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,020
He doesn't give a fuck.
That is weird.

537
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,170
But the,
I think you just got to be that guy if 

538
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,420
you want to be that good,
who else is as good as him?

539
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,040
Nobody ever.
Right.

540
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,570
Who else was that intense?
Nobody.

541
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,850
Nobody.
He takes it on to the next level.

542
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,480
God Damn crazy people out there winning 
gold medals.

543
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,870
Pretty fucking impressive.
Smokes.

544
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:18,680
A lot of wheat.
I hear.

545
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,630
Yeah.
Sabika weed.

546
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,470
Did you hear about the dea this morning?
That really pissed me off.

547
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,860
They decided not to reclassify 
marijuana.

548
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,940
So they're keeping it in the same 
category as heroin and stuff.

549
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,150
They decided that it has no medical 
benefits.

550
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,260
Why can't we just take him to one of 
these kids that have seizures and just 

551
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,260
go here,
watch,

552
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,430
see seizure now.
See no seizure.

553
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,780
Okay.
Shut the fuck up.

554
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,360
You know,
common sense knows common sense here,

555
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:47,600
right?

556
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,350
Yeah.
I mean that's,

557
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:51,290
that's definitely evidence.
But I mean there's many,

558
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:56,291
many cases of that that is evidence that
there's tests being done on these 

559
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,680
children in the real world and it's 
working.

560
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,110
I mean,
whether or not it's scientific,

561
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,670
you know,
double blind,

562
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:03,170
placebo controlled evidence.
No,

563
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:07,760
but there's plenty of evidence about the
medicinal benefits of cannabis.

564
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,170
There's plenty of it.
There's plenty.

565
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:14,171
There's.
There's all sorts of data that seems to 

566
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:14,360
indicate that it has some sort of a role
in reducing tumors.

567
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,690
It can.
It definitely helps people with anxiety.

568
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:22,691
There's A.
There's a lot of factors that it does 

569
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:23,300
that like you know,
when Neal Brennan was on,

570
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,090
he was talking about antidepressants and
he was like,

571
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:29,420
they don't exactly know how they work 
and that's a really good point,

572
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,330
but they sell fucking ton of different 
kinds of antidepressants.

573
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,720
They know how cannabis works.
They know that there's cannabinoid 

574
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,691
receptors in the human mind,
meaning the human brain is designed or 

575
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:44,070
grew up or developed alongside

576
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,050
cannabis.
It knows what to do with it,

577
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,030
so when you take marijuana,
your body knows what it is.

578
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,380
Your body even produces some sort of 
cannabinoid response.

579
00:26:55,381 --> 00:27:00,381
When you run.
That's part of what you're getting in 

580
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:00,381
the runner's high.
They say it's similar.

581
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,950
Is that correct?
I think that's correct.

582
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,250
How is this a true statement that they 
add in there that they don't know the 

583
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,400
drugs?
Chemistry is not known or reproducible,

584
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,980
that says no current obsession,
accepted medical use because the drugs 

585
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:17,160
chemistry is not reproducible,

586
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,950
not known,
and reproducible means what?

587
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:22,450
What does that mean?
Meaning drugs.

588
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,260
Chemistry is not known in reproducible.
Meaning they can't create it in a lab.

589
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,800
Yeah.
Or they can't make two of the same.

590
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,470
Maybe Maggie.
You can't keep the same.

591
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,880
You can't clone the same person over and
over again.

592
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:39,930
Every time he hits a different person,
maybe because when you get it as 

593
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,141
marijuana,
there's hundreds of different types of 

594
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:43,960
cannabinoids apparently,
and you're not just getting thc.

595
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:46,400
You're getting all kinds of other groovy
shit in there too,

596
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,110
but yeah,
I think there's a ton of different types

597
00:27:50,111 --> 00:27:55,111
of cannabinoids.
Let's go down a little fucking 

598
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:55,300
information whole young Jamie.
How many things?

599
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,330
I'm going to guess.
There's 100 different types of 

600
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,550
cannabinoids.
What do you think?

601
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,350
I would guess over a thousand.
Boom.

602
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:08,550
Jesus Christ.
I also think it's 12 hours to the 

603
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:08,550
Pentagon.
80 five.

604
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Cannabis contains at least 85 types of 
cannabinoids.

605
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,260
Many which have documented medical 
value.

606
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,870
That was 2014.
They probably found new ones.

607
00:28:16,871 --> 00:28:17,860
Bitch.
Okay,

608
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:22,861
now there's only over 480 natural 
components found in the cannabis sativa 

609
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:23,500
plant.
Okay,

610
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,050
there you go.
So that's different.

611
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,290
So it's 480 natural components.
So 113 different canabinoids says one in

612
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:35,770
wicken in wikipedia.
So you know,

613
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:37,770
it's real.
Um,

614
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,070
scroll down.
One more.

615
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,810
The one that says how many different 
cannabinoids?

616
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,500
Sixty four.
Yeah.

617
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,260
So at the answers vary depending on 
studying year.

618
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,930
This is the most recent one,
right?

619
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,050
This is 2000.
One hundred 11.

620
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,080
I think that's this 1964.
But if you scroll up it's the post is 

621
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,570
from 2015.
Yeah.

622
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,330
So I don't think this is old information
right?

623
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:06,331
There wouldn't be used in 2011 data 
would they just says that the thc was 

624
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,990
first discovered in 1964.
You know,

625
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:09,190
that's really crazy that,
you know,

626
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:14,191
when they're talking about like data 
that we're talking about like well they 

627
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,160
wouldn't be using data from like 20 
years ago,

628
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,570
like fucking ads.
He didn't know shit back then when we 

629
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,890
really do kind of think about it that 
way sometimes.

630
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,130
Like somebody sent me something the 
other day that was from three years ago 

631
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,980
and I immediately was like,
fucking three years old,

632
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,360
but it was a really interesting story,
but unless it was happening that week,

633
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,720
you know,
so what that.

634
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,880
What is that?
That's weird.

635
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,720
That sounds like an assumption.
Everyone.

636
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,830
Other people have done more research up 
until now and I've looked at that maybe 

637
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,540
I would assume that a lot of times I 
think if I saw something that said it 

638
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,661
was last month,
I would think at least five people I've 

639
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:56,761
seen it since then.
And snopes stood out and wrote another 

640
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:56,761
article.

641
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:57,480
Yeah,
but it's not even that.

642
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,270
It's an actual news event.
Not at non.

643
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,450
It's not debatable.
Just an actual news event from two years

644
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:05,040
ago is bullshit.
I don't give a fuck about it.

645
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,300
It's weird like you look down,
like whenever there's an article that 

646
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,801
someone will tweet or I find online or 
reading it on dig or something like 

647
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:19,881
that.
If I find an old article or if I'm 

648
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:23,661
researching the subject,
if I just start googling it and find 

649
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:24,900
something from 2013,
I all almost instantly go.

650
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,280
It's like three years old,
man sold back then.

651
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:32,970
They didn't know anything back then.
It's also like two,

652
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:34,770
three,
eight phone generations old too.

653
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:37,360
I think that's what you think.
Yeah.

654
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,550
I know you see someone like from 2003 
with a flip phone,

655
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:43,140
you want to go,
you fucking moron.

656
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,940
I'm looking very matrix

657
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,750
that they just had like those little 
slide out phones.

658
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,480
No concept of what an iphone was even 
going to be.

659
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:55,481
Then I don't think,
and they weren't even discussing what 

660
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:55,481
that would have been like to have social
media or any.

661
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:57,680
They're just texting each other I think.
And making phone calls.

662
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,490
Yeah.
No,

663
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,970
that's one of the interesting things 
about science fiction,

664
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,320
is it science fiction is a really poor 
indicator of what the future holds in 

665
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,020
most situations.
You know,

666
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:11,840
like no one who did star wars or star 
Trek,

667
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:14,840
they didn't think there would be able to
communicate with each other in real time

668
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,870
all around the world through video and 
send emails and get all the information,

669
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:25,571
but anything you wanted to get at any 
given time wirelessly through the air 

670
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:27,560
and a little thing that's so small,
it's slides in your front pocket.

671
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,240
Nobody ever thought that was coming.

672
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,370
Now Dee,
the day they just said how they're doing

673
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:36,250
like the five g right now and how back 
in the day,

674
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,880
you know we started off with three g or 
whatever way tbg and stuff like that and

675
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,100
now I think there's only a few countries
where 75 percent of the country is still

676
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:48,430
using two,
two g or three G and how they've run out

677
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:53,431
of frequencies to build the five g.
But or so now they're going to have to 

678
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:56,770
start just kicking people off the two G 
and three g and stuff like that.

679
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:58,900
But back then we had three gene.
We were like,

680
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,860
oh,
this is great.

681
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:02,560
We can send text messages and we could 
send pictures.

682
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:03,250
Now.
They didn't,

683
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:06,640
weren't even thinking about Netflix,
hd streaming,

684
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:06,970
you know,

685
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,050
I was just thinking,
what if he gets kicked off because this 

686
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,720
phone can't keep up with the new shit.
That's definitely happening.

687
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,780
I was thinking maybe they should make a 
new phone called the throwback for 

688
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,590
people like Ari and then this phone just
only has numbers on it.

689
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,740
Can't even text.
Call me bitch a windows phone doesn't 

690
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,251
even get a text message.
Just gets calls like an old Motorola 

691
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:28,490
Tristar.
Tristar.

692
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,570
I was trying to talk.
Talk

693
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,430
to my dad about this today.
How important is that phone number still

694
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,490
to like a person is.
It's like because there's so many 

695
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,521
different ways to communicate and you 
can communicate through voice and video 

696
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:40,521
that facebook

697
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:42,470
through facetime,
audio and Wifi.

698
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,780
Do you really still need that 10 digit 
phone number?

699
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,020
Change my phone number almost every year
now.

700
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,290
And it's nowadays it doesn't matter.
It's a better way to weed out people 

701
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,200
that shouldn't have your phone number.
Like I used to think that,

702
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,660
oh,
I had this number since I was 14,

703
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:59,240
you know,
and now I don't give a fuck anymore.

704
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,370
I know I keep my phone on the sleep mode
or whatever the,

705
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:09,371
the moon that doesn't let any phone 
calls go through and it doesn't 

706
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,500
interrupt you with alerts or anything 
and,

707
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,510
but if somebody calls you like two times
in a row or three times in a row it goes

708
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:15,630
through,
but it,

709
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,640
it,
like I accidentally leave it on all the 

710
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:20,640
time and I'm like,
you know,

711
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,770
this is so peaceful.
Not hearing my fucking phone beeping and

712
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:26,771
ringing.
And so I think that's important because 

713
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,411
I think we forget that we didn't have 
that growing up most of our lives and 

714
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:31,760
now it's almost like an alarm clock 
going off every two minutes.

715
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,230
You know?
It's not,

716
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,870
it doesn't give you a chance to live 
like a normal life.

717
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,590
If you're constantly updating yourself 
with twitter or with

718
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,760
text messages and you're constantly 
looking at it.

719
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
That's what your focus is on.
And it's almost like you're not even 

720
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,701
living your life.
You're living your life through this 

721
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:51,831
screen.
Like you're going into another world 

722
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:54,411
like this artificially created world and
that's how you're existing in a world 

723
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:56,550
where no one's talking.
If they are talking to,

724
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:58,470
talking to you,
like you click on a video,

725
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:03,650
who you,
most of the time what's going on as 

726
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,751
you're reading stuff,
you're reading stuff or someone sending 

727
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:05,751
something,
lol.

728
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:05,880
They're sending you a funny meme.
You're like,

729
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:06,810
ah,
you know,

730
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:07,310
there's,
there's,

731
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,160
there's those things and that's like how
people are living.

732
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,790
Like people are like seeking out funny 
instagram posts,

733
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,150
you know,
and like I,

734
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:21,151
I have friends that have,
they subscribed to like 10 different 

735
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:23,700
funny instagram meme posts and just 
every 15 seconds they'll look at it,

736
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:26,290
their phone going,
ah,

737
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,260
you know,
and you can do that.

738
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:33,261
Like you can be fucking perpetually 
entertained all day if you choose to do 

739
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:37,671
that.
If you follow the right instagram memes 

740
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:40,520
and you have the right people on twitter
that send you the interesting shit 

741
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,850
because there's always something new.
There's always some new fucking crazy 

742
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,850
thing.
You're going to be constant,

743
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,020
constantly entertained.

744
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,350
Going back to the marijuana thing with 
the dea that they had that happen,

745
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,750
they had to read or do that because the 
governor got so many signed petitions or

746
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,760
assigned names that it forced them to 
have to reclassify the marijuana.

747
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:05,520
I don't know what governor,
but whoever it was,

748
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,360
you know,
if they,

749
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:11,361
uh,
they acquiesce to the demands of the 

750
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:11,361
Internet,
right.

751
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,150
We definitely didn't do it enough then.
So.

752
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:16,020
So if more ramped up and they say that 
they couldn't clot,

753
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:21,070
reclassify that to keep it the same 
because they couldn't find any health 

754
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:21,070
benefits from it.
Right.

755
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,260
So what happens if the same governor 
gets all the signatures to reclassify 

756
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:30,501
cigarettes or alcohol?
What would the da have to say then for 

757
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:34,701
the health benefits of those two?
Would they have to reclassify it as 

758
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:35,070
illegal?
It's a very good point.

759
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,810
Let's try it.
See what happens.

760
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,100
I'd love to see what happens.
It's a very

761
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,840
good point.
It's a very good point.

762
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,080
And here's another really good point.
The classifying it in schedule one,

763
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:50,091
because that's where it's been and 
because they're they claim there's no 

764
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:52,560
known medical use or it can't be 
reproducible.

765
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,350
Whatever the fuck that means you can 
grow it dummy.

766
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,750
You can get clones and grow it.
Of course it's reproducible.

767
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:02,751
It's just reproducible as a plant.
So what they're saying is it trying to 

768
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:04,470
classify it as a drug,
what they're almost admitting themselves

769
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,720
if,
if what we're thinking is true.

770
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:08,340
If what they're saying is that you 
can't,

771
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,850
it's not reproducible because it's not a
chemical that you can break down into a 

772
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:18,621
pill if that's what they're saying.
Like you can't standardize it because 

773
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:18,660
it's too wild and it's free.
It's growing.

774
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,310
That's almost a perfect example of the 
fact that you're.

775
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,440
You're not.
You shouldn't be in a position where 

776
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:27,440
you're controlling a plant.

777
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,510
You shouldn't have be in a position 
where you're regulating nature,

778
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,940
but that's so you're almost admitting it
yourself.

779
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,580
It's not reproducible.
Okay?

780
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,070
If that's what you're saying,
then you're saying it's not a drug.

781
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,910
Okay,
so,

782
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:41,070
but as a psychoactive effect,
okay,

783
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,430
now you have to prove that psychoactive 
effect is dangerous.

784
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,320
There's nothing that's the real problem.
The real problem is classified in the 

785
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:54,570
category of the most dangerous,
harmful drugs.

786
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,520
There is no evidence that that's should 
that.

787
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,220
That should be correct.
There's no evidence,

788
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,340
so that's where the dea is failing.
They're failing way more in that than 

789
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:09,681
they are in even not admitting that 
there's medical evidence because if you 

790
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:10,590
wanted to follow it to the strictest 
sense of the word,

791
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,860
what studies have been done that have 
absolutely been proven in a new modern 

792
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:22,011
form of like the most current science,
what studies have been done that show 

793
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:23,370
the medical benefits of cannabis?

794
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,500
I'm not that many studies being done,
but it's because it's classified as 

795
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,040
schedule one.
It's a total catch 22.

796
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,250
It's hard to get studies done because 
it's a schedule one and so you can't 

797
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,850
prove it shouldn't be a schedule one 
because there's not very many studies,

798
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,370
but there's a ton of studies that have 
been done by universities.

799
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,880
There's a ton of studies that have shown
positive benefits.

800
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,120
If you want to go back into history,
even back into the Nixon administration,

801
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:50,330
they were running studies that they 
buried the results because the results 

802
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,120
showed no harm.
They showed nothing.

803
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,300
They can't,
so when you follow just straight 

804
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,300
science,
there's no.

805
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,200
There's no evidence whatsoever.
It should be illegal.

806
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,380
That's the most important thing.
It's not evidence of whether it should 

807
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,380
be legal.
That's like,

808
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,640
you know the whole thing about you're 
innocent until proven guilty.

809
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,590
It should be the same way about 
marijuana.

810
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,280
It should be that you can't just make it
illegal and say it has to remain illegal

811
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,950
because we don't know what it can do 
because you do know can do you do.

812
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:21,990
You definitely know.
Why do you think that millions of people

813
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:23,400
like it?
Are they all crazy?

814
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:28,730
What's going on?
All these millions and millions of 

815
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:28,730
adults that live in America,
are they fucking crazy?

816
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,350
So what are you saying?
You're saying you're smarter than them.

817
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,650
Why don't you talk about it with 
somebody that knows what the fuck 

818
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:36,650
they're talking about and you'll get 
buried.

819
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,590
Talk about it with a person who's like 
talking about it with like todd 

820
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,531
mccormick committed Tom Mccormick having
a debate with one of these dea guys 

821
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,040
about whether or not marijuana is 
beneficial.

822
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,580
He survived cancer because of it.
Now a lot of people have.

823
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,950
We have friends that have kids that have
autism.

824
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,160
They give their fucking kids this 
medical cannabis and all of a sudden 

825
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,160
they can talk.

826
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,520
They relax,
they stop having seizures.

827
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,420
It's a massive benefit to a lot of 
people.

828
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,300
It relaxes people,
makes people feel good,

829
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:09,810
and we have a government agency in 2016 
that ignores all of that and wants to 

830
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:14,200
keep it in the category of some of the 
most harmful and dangerous drugs.

831
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,050
These people that live in an episode of 
Hawaii,

832
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:22,051
five o delivered in the past,
they're like 19 fifties people and what 

833
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:27,961
they think they can do is keep this,
this bureaucracy and this paperwork and 

834
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:35,161
these classifications in in movement and
they can head off freedom because what 

835
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:41,731
they're trying to do is they're trying 
to stop freedom and one of the reasons 

836
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:43,210
why they trap trying to stop freedom is 
because they benefit from it.

837
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,120
They benefit from stopping it.
They have more agents.

838
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,110
If those eight,
if all of a sudden most drugs are legal,

839
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,330
what do those fucking thousands of Dea 
agents going to do?

840
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,750
They have.
They're protecting their own industry.

841
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,080
This is a natural thing that any 
organism does when it's threatened and 

842
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,540
if you start making drugs legal and you 
start opening up that conversation like,

843
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,740
who the fuck is any one adult to tell 
any other adult,

844
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:12,430
what's good or bad for you?
When a lot of shit we do,

845
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:13,600
whether it's the food,
we eat,

846
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,340
the alcohol,
we drank the cigarettes,

847
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:19,480
we smoke the fucking sugar in our diet.
All these things are bad for us.

848
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:22,660
We all know that,
but we were afraid it was the government

849
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:25,180
going to come in with a fucking machine 
guns to stop you from eating a chocolate

850
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:27,310
cake and smoking a cigarette.
Fuck that.

851
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,050
Right?
I think we all agree on that.

852
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,180
If you.
If they can't do that,

853
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,190
they shouldn't be able to stop you from 
smoking weed.

854
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,400
This is archaic.
This is like this is some ancient 

855
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,810
fucking vampire shit and they're 
clinging to civilization.

856
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,510
They are totally irrelevant,
totally irrelevant.

857
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:48,070
Your decision should be made 100 percent
on the facts that are available today.

858
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:53,430
You can go.
You could research all the facts about 

859
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,430
matter.
Marijuana.

860
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,140
You find a few that make correlations 
between some sort of mental illnesses,

861
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,210
but those core,
most of the time,

862
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,540
at least according to experts that I've 
listened to talk about it,

863
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:07,050
the correlations of schizophrenia to 
marijuana use are directly in 

864
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,791
proportionate with the court.
The numbers of schizophrenia for any 

865
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:15,331
given population that there's always 
going to be around one percent of the 

866
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:18,751
population that suffers from some type 
of schizophrenia or severe mental 

867
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:19,990
distraction.
Illness.

868
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,200
You know,
a bunch of different categories.

869
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,700
These little various mental diseases,
but it's always that number,

870
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,970
so if they smoked pot,
it's just a thousand people that smoked 

871
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,780
pot have schizophrenia.
Okay.

872
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,110
If there was the same amount of people 
and they didn't smoke pot,

873
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,260
it might be the same amount of 
schizophrenia,

874
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,340
x,
they might not even be connected,

875
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:43,880
but when you're talking about 300 
million people and you say 30,000

876
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:47,150
people got schizophrenia for marijuana,
are you fucking sure?

877
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,060
Are you a really fucking sure.
Or is it just 30,000

878
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,880
people have schizophrenia and they also 
smoke marijuana.

879
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,820
This is the car.
This is a real problem with the way they

880
00:41:55,821 --> 00:42:00,821
present the data because it's just like 
you coming up to me or to Jamie and you 

881
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,480
saying you've got new rules.
You as a 42 year old grown ass man.

882
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,870
You have new rules and we did.
You don't want us drinking alcohol 

883
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:10,870
anymore.
You're gonna.

884
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,410
You're gonna come in and you've hired 
guards to keep us from smoking alcohol 

885
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,520
or drinking alcohol.
It's the same thing.

886
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,660
If it's a 50,000
people with some big building with three

887
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:23,720
letters in the front event or whether 
it's one crazy fuck,

888
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,360
who wants to stop his neighbor from 
smoking pot?

889
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,750
It's the same thing.
You're trying to stop someone from doing

890
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:32,690
something that's not bad like you can't 
do that.

891
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,760
You don't have any evidence that it's 
bad.

892
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,970
There should be a fuck load of evidence 
that if it's bad and it should be as 

893
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:44,201
much or worse than all the shit that you
know is bad that you sell open and make 

894
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,160
money from taxes,
alcohol,

895
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,080
alcohol,
which we both love.

896
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,870
I love,
but here's a great example.

897
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,450
I talk a lot.
They just recently released a study that

898
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,480
I think this week showing the like they 
proved scientifically that wheat is 

899
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:03,170
better for sex and they not only did it 
for pleasures,

900
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:06,170
but they also explained how when you 
have alcohol,

901
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,270
you,
you cheat more,

902
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,110
you,
you do bad things.

903
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,330
You Hook up with people who shouldn't 
do.

904
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:16,331
You don't use condoms.
Like do a lot of shit that a lot of 

905
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:17,600
people change.
Like I'm on team boobs,

906
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,140
let's do this danger style,
but it's shit that is life changing and 

907
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,550
getting a girl pregnant that you hook 
met at a bar that looked hot last night.

908
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,000
You wake up and it's a dog,
you know,

909
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,300
like all the dog.
You're talking about a woman,

910
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:34,350
a woman human.
How dare you know is that slut shaming 

911
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:38,450
about Shit's actually.
There was an article on a website that I

912
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:40,790
go to all the time and I don't want to 
make fun of the man who wrote it because

913
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,040
I love him,
but it was about.

914
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,400
It was about fat shaming in martial arts
is Julianna Pena fat shames Ronda Rousey

915
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:55,210
and Julianna Pena,
who's a one of the toughest 135 pound 

916
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,630
fighters in the women's Bantamweight 
Division in the UFC.

917
00:43:56,631 --> 00:43:59,350
She's bad ass.
She talking some shit.

918
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:00,740
She's trying to get people to pay 
attention to her.

919
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:05,741
I mean this will.
Conor mcgregor did so a lot of these 

920
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:06,050
fucking people do.
It's a smart business move.

921
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,960
Okay,
so that we all should be aware of.

922
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:10,070
Right?
I mean,

923
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:12,260
it's not just a person saying this is 
someone.

924
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:17,290
It's a smart business move,
so she says this quote about Ronda 

925
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,400
Rousey and she says something about 
Ronda Rousey having fat arms,

926
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,000
and so the title of this whole piece,
she wants to beat her ass.

927
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:28,001
Okay.
This which she wants to do to Ronda 

928
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:28,001
Rousey,
she wants to hold her down and she wants

929
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:28,760
a mounir.
She wants to elbow her face bloody.

930
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,200
She wants to punch her eyes so that 
they're swollen and shut down.

931
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,940
She wants to get behind her and choke 
her and say nasty shit to where she puts

932
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,160
her unconscious.
That's what she wants to do.

933
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,660
That's what you would like to do,
right?

934
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:41,790
That's what almost all of these fighters
would like to do.

935
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:45,270
When they're locked in mortal combat,
they want to beat the other person's ass

936
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,670
and they want to choke them out.
Right.

937
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,900
The nasty stuff I made,
I put that in myself.

938
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,240
I'm in,
you know,

939
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:55,790
point being.
I've seen people say some nasty shit to 

940
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:55,790
people whether choking them out by the 
way,

941
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,320
but point being that seems to be way 
worse than Sanchez fat arms.

942
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,180
Right?
What's this going to look like?

943
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,590
What's her face?
Look beautiful.

944
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,640
We're going opinions.
Beautiful.

945
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,680
She's beautiful,
she's beautiful,

946
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,180
but.
So it's Ronda Rousey,

947
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:11,181
but she said,
you know that she said something about 

948
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:11,181
Ronda Rousey having fat arms.

949
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:15,920
I forget what the quote was about.
Something about she's over her and you 

950
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:19,920
know the fucking the tie.
One of the things that it said,

951
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,950
yeah,
no one cares about Ronda rousey and her 

952
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:24,950
fat arms anymore.
It's listen,

953
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,860
that's a funny thing to say and you see 
Julia and opinions.

954
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,040
He appreciated.
Yeah,

955
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,180
except for that knows.
She just got beat up.

956
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:32,070
That was a fight.
That's all swollen up,

957
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,180
right?
They're not even beat up.

958
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:35,850
She's never been beat up and she's a bad
ass.

959
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:39,060
She's tough and she's trying to make 
some try and make some waves.

960
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:44,330
But the article that I read was talking 
about the fat shaming that women should 

961
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:44,330
never fat.
Shame each other.

962
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,540
Women fighters shouldn't fetch.
And I'm like,

963
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,730
listen,
it's called talking shit.

964
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:51,750
It's called talking shit.
You can't stop them from talking shit by

965
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:53,320
putting it to this new category.

966
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,930
Fat Shaming.
What?

967
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,110
That is the most mild form of mockery 
ever.

968
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:04,310
A beautiful woman who has big arms,
she'll fucking throw you on your head 

969
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:08,241
with those big arms.
There's a reason for those fucking 

970
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:08,241
things,
man.

971
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:08,850
They work.
I did date a girl with big arms.

972
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:12,540
It was weird because I say it's so 
beautiful.

973
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:17,570
Had a nice body,
but for some reason her arms are about 

974
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:17,850
double time.
And so if she were the wrong shirts,

975
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:20,940
it was very uncomfortable to continue to
look at,

976
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,080
you know,
how you have those,

977
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:27,081
like a sexual,
actual paids when you're like a in your 

978
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:27,480
early 19,
20 years,

979
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:28,110
you know,
like 20,

980
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:33,111
21 you have.
Like sometimes you only meet someone 

981
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:33,111
you've never seen him again.
And this is a,

982
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:34,530
this is even more interesting because 
it's,

983
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,050
you know,
there was no cell phones back then,

984
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,880
so you couldn't really get in touch with
people that well,

985
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,880
you got to call them at home if the 
phone didn't pick up,

986
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:42,630
they didn't have an answer.

987
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,060
Machine couldn't even leave a message.
It was weird back then.

988
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:46,260
Right?
But uh,

989
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:51,261
I hooked up with this chick that I 
always thought I've thought about for 

990
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:51,261
years after,
like whatever happened to that girl,

991
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:53,930
she was a bank,
oh fuck.

992
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,550
And she was in the weightlifting,
like,

993
00:46:56,551 --> 00:47:00,150
seriously in a weightlifting and she had
a full on six pack.

994
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,680
Wow.
I've got a full six pack.

995
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:06,681
She was like frank and she had these big
ass fucking squatter legs and she was a 

996
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:11,220
freak.
And I always remember like,

997
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,710
God damn,
like whatever happened,

998
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,580
that crazy girl,
she was fun.

999
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,890
You didn't look her up,
you didn't find her and if she's too big

1000
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:18,390
for me,
man made me nervous.

1001
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,270
She made me nervous.
I'm not kidding.

1002
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,870
I mean she was real nice and she lived 
like really far away to a thing.

1003
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:26,400
She was like an hour and a half away 
from me.

1004
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,470
An hour and a half drive,
just,

1005
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,480
you know,
those don't work out when you're 20 and 

1006
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:32,480
you're

1007
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,430
busy with a million other things.
But she was a tank.

1008
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,740
Yeah.
I've been with a couple of girls that 

1009
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,271
were in mma to mma girls type girls' 
bodies and it's not comfortable and 

1010
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,660
thinking like,
oh,

1011
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:45,710
this girl can kill me if I didn't like 
having sex with them was weird.

1012
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,690
It was just like,
I feel like I'm fucking a guy.

1013
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,120
We did a fica pen and the other day and 
uh,

1014
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:55,180
Eddie Bravo was drunk off his rocker and
we were all having fun and talking about

1015
00:47:56,031 --> 00:47:58,490
whether or not female UFC fighters,
like what,

1016
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,300
what untrained male could fuck up a 
female UFC fighter.

1017
00:48:02,301 --> 00:48:05,480
Like how big does the woman have to be?
How big is the man?

1018
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:07,820
I got to be.
We got the Cyborg versus Ray Lewis.

1019
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,920
It was one of the most ridiculous 
conversations we've ever had.

1020
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:18,370
And he got to the point where he was 
using like social justice warrior 

1021
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,461
tactics.
He said that we all hated women and he 

1022
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:25,110
was insisting that a good day,
uh,

1023
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,830
he wanted to have,
who's a bad ass fighter.

1024
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,900
But she also fights 100,
15 pounds.

1025
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,790
Like how big would the man have to be 
for like a,

1026
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,000
we're thinking like a 190 pounds 
untrained man I'm on.

1027
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,070
And then we've got to be like,
okay,

1028
00:48:37,071 --> 00:48:42,071
well what's untrained?
What if he has a year of high school 

1029
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:42,071
wrestling,
have a year of high school wrestling.

1030
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,960
That's the guy who understands how to 
take people down at the very least.

1031
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,970
And if he gets on top of you in 190 
pounds a year,

1032
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:48,920
1:15
you might be Foxville.

1033
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,980
Right?
And so then we got into this crazy 

1034
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:53,980
conversation.
Then it got to blink.

1035
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,880
Seibold will fuck up any untrained dude.
What about Ray Lewis?

1036
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:56,660
And then it got site.

1037
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,530
So inside his twitter page,
Ray Lewis,

1038
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:05,810
249 pounds.
It says Chris Cyborg,

1039
00:49:05,811 --> 00:49:08,840
1:39.
That is a fucking lie.

1040
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,600
Cris Cyborg.
First of all,

1041
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,500
I think they should make a 145 pound 
weight class just for her because the 

1042
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,371
UFC right now has to 115 and 135 
recognized classes and the women's 

1043
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:25,640
division and they had sideboard get down
to 1:40

1044
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:29,630
for one fight.
She fought a Leslie Smith at 1:40,

1045
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:32,180
so that's more realistic that she weighs
1:45,

1046
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,180
but you really only weighs 1:45
after a brutal weight cut.

1047
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,100
She's probably closer to one 65 five.
Yeah,

1048
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:43,450
in real life,
but they keep making it get down to 

1049
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:43,450
1:40,
which I don't.

1050
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:47,110
I don't fucking.
It's not like she's not going to fight 

1051
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:47,110
at 1:35.
She's too big,

1052
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,850
but there's a video of her making weight
for 1:40

1053
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:52,700
that she just put up.
It's horrific,

1054
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:53,750
man.
She's crying.

1055
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:59,120
She's like broken down.
I mean they get so fucking drained and 

1056
00:49:59,661 --> 00:50:01,340
then they got to fight 24 hours later.

1057
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,160
It's crazy.
The whole process is crazy.

1058
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,820
It's dangerous and it's stupid and it's 
unnecessary.

1059
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:13,330
You should let these athletes like they 
should figure out what I think the real 

1060
00:50:13,941 --> 00:50:15,290
problem is.
Here's one of the problems.

1061
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:17,960
Is there a specific weight classes?
Right?

1062
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,940
There's like 1:55.
There's 1:17

1063
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,980
is one of 85 and in each specific weight
class the guy has.

1064
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,230
There's a champion,
right?

1065
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,790
But the,
the,

1066
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:33,080
the variety of people like what your 
natural weight should be,

1067
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,950
it's really should be what you are when 
you're healthy in shape and you're 

1068
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,060
walking around and ideally that's 
exactly where you should be fighting.

1069
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:45,320
The problem is people are going to 
fucking game the system and I think what

1070
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:49,070
we have to do is we have to shame people
that try to gain the system.

1071
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,940
People that try to dehydrate themselves 
and fight smaller people.

1072
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,540
That's like contrary to everything that 
martial arts is supposed to be about.

1073
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:01,870
You're supposed to be.
It's supposed to be about testing your 

1074
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:04,511
skills and especially in the competition
sense versus someone who the exact same 

1075
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:05,810
size as you,
so you're testing your skills,

1076
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,710
you're testing your ability against 
someone who is the same size as you,

1077
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,860
but if you pretend that you're that size
but you only that size for like an hour 

1078
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,550
because you dehydrate yourself but then 
you below up and you're much bigger 

1079
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:23,021
after it's over.
That's sort of contrary to what martial 

1080
00:51:23,021 --> 00:51:23,090
arts is supposed to be about.

1081
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,070
Do you think it's the frequency of the 
UFC is how many there are?

1082
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,920
How many,
you mean they're flooding the UFC?

1083
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,830
There's one almost every two weeks now.
Do you think if they were like,

1084
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,600
you're only allowed to fight every three
years,

1085
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:39,601
but we're paying you twice as much,
do you think that would help out a 

1086
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:39,601
fighters?

1087
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:40,280
Um,
I don't think that's the solution.

1088
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,280
I think it's good to have a bunch of 
different suggestions,

1089
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,860
but I think what,
right now,

1090
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:49,220
everyone's locked into these pathways of
fighting for titles.

1091
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,130
This is what I think.
I think that's awesome.

1092
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,470
Don't get me wrong.
I love when someone wins the belt.

1093
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,390
I love it.
It's exciting.

1094
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,630
You know,
when I get to walk up to someone and 

1095
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,971
say,
Tyron Woodley the new welterweight 

1096
00:52:03,971 --> 00:52:03,971
champion,
the world.

1097
00:52:03,971 --> 00:52:04,640
Like,
how does that sound like?

1098
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:09,641
That's real.
You get to participate in one of the 

1099
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:11,630
most special moments of an athlete's 
career.

1100
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:17,170
Have a fighter's entire struggle as a,
as a competitor in one of the most 

1101
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:21,650
difficult things a person could ever do.
So that moment is like,

1102
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,150
that's a crazy,
critical,

1103
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:26,270
huge,
massive moment for anyone.

1104
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,600
I remember clearly saying that to me.
Should tate.

1105
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,630
I remember clearly,
Sandra Day O'connor,

1106
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:33,530
Mcgregor,
Tyron Woodley,

1107
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,750
Robbie Lawler,
I remember it clearly.

1108
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,580
A lot of these guys.
It's a huge,

1109
00:52:37,581 --> 00:52:42,581
huge moments.
Don't think the average person and even 

1110
00:52:42,581 --> 00:52:42,581
me,
I don't think,

1111
00:52:42,581 --> 00:52:46,841
I mean as close as I am to the struggle,
to the fights and calling them all and 

1112
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:52,421
being there.
I don't think I understand it like he 

1113
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:52,421
understands it.
There's no way I can't.

1114
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:53,540
There's no way I do.
I just don't.

1115
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,410
So there's that.
But after that,

1116
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,460
what do we really want to see?
We want to see the best people fight the

1117
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:09,461
best people.
I don't know if the title of champion is

1118
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:12,890
the best way to do that.
I mean,

1119
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:15,080
we all are.
We're all obsessed with WHO's the best.

1120
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:17,720
Right?
And that is a good thing I guess because

1121
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:22,721
it forces people to fucking just 
polished that sword to the perfect 

1122
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:24,980
sharpness.
But at the end of the day,

1123
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,030
do we want to see.
We want to see the best people fight the

1124
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:28,620
best people.
That's what we really want to say.

1125
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:33,700
Oh,
I say dia is double slap connor in the 

1126
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:33,700
face at the same time.
Like,

1127
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:33,700
okay,
look,

1128
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,440
let me ask you this right now.
If somebody had to offer you a paper 

1129
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,400
review tomorrow,
if there's a paper review they were 

1130
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,400
doing tomorrow and it's Nick Diaz versus
George St Pierre.

1131
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,030
There's no title on the line.

1132
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,270
Who gives a fuck about a title?
I don't care at all.

1133
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:50,450
I couldn't care less about a title if 
it's George St Pierre Versus Nick Diaz.

1134
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,680
I'm in.
I'm in.

1135
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,330
Yeah,
right.

1136
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,920
One hundred percent.
I think that's the same thing with tyron

1137
00:53:55,921 --> 00:54:00,921
woodley versus Nick Diaz or Tyron 
Woodley versus George St Pierre.

1138
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,830
Like it doesn't have to be for a title 
like I want to see that.

1139
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,890
I want to see what that is and I mean 
it's amazing when a person wins the 

1140
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,150
title,
it is a gigantic achievement,

1141
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,140
but what do you really want to see as 
an.

1142
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,500
As a person who enjoys the sport,
you want to see a guy who was beating 

1143
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:21,500
everybody,
right?

1144
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,770
You want to see a guy who just keeps 
beating.

1145
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:27,771
Guys.
It doesn't matter if there's a belt on 

1146
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:29,871
the line.
If I find out that Robbie lawler's one 

1147
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:30,270
six fights in a row against world class 
competition,

1148
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:31,530
I'm like,
he's beaten this guy.

1149
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,390
He's beaten that guy.
He's beaten Matt Brown.

1150
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:35,790
He's beaten Johny Hendricks.
I don't.

1151
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,760
The belt doesn't mean a thing to me.
It really doesn't.

1152
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,510
I just want to see Ken Robbie lawler 
beat Tyron Woodley,

1153
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,210
Tyron Woodley Beats Robbie lawler.
I start thinking,

1154
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:48,330
okay,
can tyron Woodley beat George St Pierre.

1155
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,640
Can you see George St Pierre Ready to 
come back?

1156
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:53,490
If he is,
can tyron Woodley beat him or can George

1157
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:58,470
fighter really smart fight all law the 
way Rory Mcdonald did and Rory Macdonald

1158
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:03,590
shut down a lot of tyrone's offense in 
their fight and won a decision or is 

1159
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:05,910
tyron better than he was that I want to 
see that.

1160
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,060
Is he better?
I want to see is is he's super confident

1161
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:14,061
now that he won the title is he just.
Is he going to take them to some whole 

1162
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:14,660
new level?
You got.

1163
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:19,670
You beat a guy like Robbie lawler.
You knock them out and in one round 

1164
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,670
you've got to think the momentum coming 
off of that.

1165
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:20,400
It's got to be stunning.

1166
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:27,170
I would love to see fantasy UFC like a 
show where they take maybe the fighters 

1167
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,050
that have retired or people that aren't 
as good as the other fires and have them

1168
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,980
like almost do like game shows,
stuff like this.

1169
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:32,420
Like you have to do a game,
go.

1170
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,190
Alright.
So this fight you have your shoes tied,

1171
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:36,050
you have to hold a banana and not crush 
it.

1172
00:55:36,051 --> 00:55:37,970
You have to protect this banana.
Like it's a baby,

1173
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,220
you know,
like fun things like that,

1174
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,840
you know what I mean?
Like you're saying.

1175
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,010
But because I think even as I think as a
fight it would still be fun just to have

1176
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,160
other options.
Like almost like a video game,

1177
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,490
you know,
where your doctor.

1178
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,050
I've told you many times something wrong
with his brain and we need competition.

1179
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,370
Still have some kind.
Like there's,

1180
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,030
you know,
the fight is still a competition,

1181
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:04,031
but if you take away the belt,
you still maybe want to have like a 

1182
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:04,280
tournament a month,
not monthly,

1183
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:07,250
but maybe a quarterly tournament or a 
second season of some kind.

1184
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:09,010
So there's something.
Did you ever see,

1185
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,000
um,
showtime did

1186
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,410
in boxing with the middleweight 
division,

1187
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:15,730
that whole,
um,

1188
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:21,110
series of a series of events a few years
back with Carl fraud and bunch of other,

1189
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:23,800
uh,
Andre Ward was in it,

1190
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,330
a super six,
is that what it is?

1191
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,920
Super Six world boxing classic and it 
was super middleweight and they got the 

1192
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:36,931
best super middleweights in the world 
and they paired them off against each 

1193
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:40,351
other and this long running series where
they're all committed to fighting each 

1194
00:56:40,351 --> 00:56:41,470
other.
It was really interesting,

1195
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,840
really interesting as an idea,
like,

1196
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,870
as a combat sport idea and you know,
you think about like what that could 

1197
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:49,570
mean for the future.
Um,

1198
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:53,320
I think something like that for mma,
mixed martial arts would be gigantic and

1199
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:58,321
it could generate a lot of interest and 
it could be something where they put up 

1200
00:56:58,321 --> 00:56:59,050
a ton of money,
like instead of a world title,

1201
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,900
like what have they had an invitational.
What if they,

1202
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,960
someone put together an invitation,
they made a deal with the UFC and they 

1203
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,090
made a deal with,
you know,

1204
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:11,320
um,
one fc or whatever the organizations are

1205
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:16,321
that are valid.
And you have a tournament where they're 

1206
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:20,251
all going to duke it out and there's 
going to be some sort of split of 

1207
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:23,611
revenue of the paper view of this one 
tournament and you'll have this super 

1208
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:26,020
six type thing like they did with 
showtime with boxing.

1209
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,310
Be Insane,
man.

1210
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:28,750
That'd be epic.

1211
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,200
Isn't fighting for that revenue also?
Maybe good or is that bad?

1212
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:36,260
Because you could have extra problems 
with that.

1213
00:57:36,261 --> 00:57:39,000
Maybe with people taking dives or 
backend deals.

1214
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:39,830
There's whatnot.
I don't know.

1215
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,210
I don't know how problems come in with 
that,

1216
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:41,390
but

1217
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,620
the real money and fighting is always in
winning.

1218
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,730
So like getting people to throw fights.
Boy,

1219
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:52,731
that's unusual.
It's so unusual in a high end fighting 

1220
00:57:52,731 --> 00:57:55,530
because when a fighter loses,
it's not just about losing that fight.

1221
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:00,560
It's also about they lost their last 
fight so then they're coming into their 

1222
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,711
next fight as a loser.
So they're getting less money so people 

1223
00:58:03,711 --> 00:58:04,860
don't like them as much.
And you know,

1224
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:10,100
if somebody hits you and you just fall 
down and pretend that you got knocked 

1225
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,100
out,
you can't do that.

1226
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,780
And you can make money like that.
Somebody could bet you or promise you,

1227
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:13,830
right?
Someone could say,

1228
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,440
I'm betting 300 grand and you go down 
the first round,

1229
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:17,810
I'll give you a $100,000
for.

1230
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:21,210
I know you're only getting paid 20 grand
and so you do that.

1231
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:24,420
And some dude that has totally been done
in the world of boxing.

1232
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:29,450
It's definitely happened.
I'm sure it's probably happened in the 

1233
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:29,450
UFC.
I'm not aware of it happening,

1234
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:32,430
but there's always the potential for 
people being deceptive

1235
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:35,660
happened in every sport.
I'm pretty sure at some point or another

1236
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,680
at one time.

1237
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,380
Yeah.
It wasn't an NBA referee scandal.

1238
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,030
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1239
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:41,650
Tim,
Donna Hay,

1240
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:46,651
I believe he lied and he went to jail 
for it too and he was betting he was 

1241
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:48,610
making bets on things that he knew from 
insight information,

1242
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:53,611
whether it's like this particular 
referee calls really bad against this 

1243
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:58,771
team because maybe he doesn't like 
someone on the team or something like 

1244
00:58:58,771 --> 00:58:58,771
that.
They're not supposed to do that,

1245
00:58:58,771 --> 00:58:59,020
but he was calling out information 
publicly.

1246
00:58:59,021 --> 00:59:01,870
I think he wrote a book about it.
All the referees also then said,

1247
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,430
he's bullshit.
He's an asshole.

1248
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,560
He's obviously a scumbag,
he went to jail,

1249
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,860
but when you look at the track records 
of some of these things that he was 

1250
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,621
saying,
it looks to say that there is some way 

1251
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:13,621
that there isn't a little bit of water 
there,

1252
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:14,810
that he's something so whether or not

1253
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:22,130
try to get that statement of.
So I like to like where people

1254
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,060
were talking about.
Oh yeah.

1255
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:28,190
Oh yeah,
that fucking little bit of water in 

1256
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:28,190
there.
Huh?

1257
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:28,420
That statement holds water is what I was
trying to say.

1258
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:32,230
So he might've got framed,
I don't know about framed,

1259
00:59:32,231 --> 00:59:33,100
but they might.
He,

1260
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:37,350
he definitely got caught and what he was
doing and I think it was betting store,

1261
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,060
like maybe what Pete rose did.
Right?

1262
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:44,530
But then he wrote a book afterwards 
talking about all this stuff you knew 

1263
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:45,760
and all this scumbag shit other referees
were doing.

1264
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:47,630
I'll take your name or anything like 
that,

1265
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,010
but somebody wanted to talk to him and 
see if what other things he knows.

1266
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,320
Yeah,
man.

1267
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,720
I would imagine if you have something 
where people bet on it,

1268
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,650
like professional sports or even college
sports,

1269
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:06,580
I would imagine there's so many people 
that bet on those games that there's 

1270
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,190
always going to be like low lives.

1271
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,300
Like I know friends who use actual real 
old school bookies.

1272
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:12,950
Really?
Yeah,

1273
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:14,260
man.
They use real bookies.

1274
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,680
Bookies still exists.
Tim,

1275
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:20,770
Donna Hay,
100 percent of NBA referees gamble when 

1276
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,460
weird stuff was happening this year in 
the NBA.

1277
01:00:22,461 --> 01:00:24,230
People always like to say that they're,
uh,

1278
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:29,000
they are setting things up for money and
ratings and whatnot.

1279
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:34,001
And they'll go to wherever he wants to 
write an article will go to him and get 

1280
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:35,150
a quote from him saying this thing was 
fixed or this thing was staged.

1281
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,190
And it's unprovable usually,
but he'll say it right.

1282
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,320
Should hire amish people or something.
People,

1283
01:00:42,321 --> 01:00:44,990
they definitely don't care or have tvs.
Well,

1284
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:46,850
you know what man?
A duh.

1285
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,830
The sports fans.
Yeah.

1286
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:53,930
Most sports fans gambled head.
That's another thing that government 

1287
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:53,930
fucks a song.
How about that?

1288
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:58,110
You should be able to gamble on whatever
the fuck you want all over town.

1289
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,320
And the idea that like money,
one gambling should be taxed and that's 

1290
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,140
why they're there.
They're trying to keep it this.

1291
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,620
Listen,
I didn't earn this money.

1292
01:01:07,621 --> 01:01:11,880
I bet you bet money to make money that 
is so different than earning money.

1293
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,130
You tell me I earned it.
Fuck you.

1294
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:19,131
You Crooks.
Unless it's scratch offs or the lottery 

1295
01:01:19,131 --> 01:01:20,460
by the government in that case,
gamble,

1296
01:01:20,461 --> 01:01:24,510
gamble,
gamble with a fun logo and a big smile.

1297
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:29,511
And you could win power ball.
It's a power ball.

1298
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,430
Yeah.
Fuck you.

1299
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,660
Fuck you overlords.
Yeah.

1300
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,960
Fuck you for trying to keep weed from 
us.

1301
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:42,140
Fuck you.
From the gambling or gambling destroys 

1302
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,610
families.
Gambling destroys families.

1303
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:49,820
My own family lost everything.
Now he's a retard.

1304
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,510
Your uncle was a retard.
Retard lose everything.

1305
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,550
They lose it through math.
They lose it through gambling.

1306
01:01:56,551 --> 01:01:59,940
They lose through sucking trucker Dick 
for crack money.

1307
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,150
They lose it through all sorts of ways.
They're fucking crazy.

1308
01:02:03,151 --> 01:02:08,151
There's,
there's a certain amount of crazy 

1309
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:08,151
people.
You can't blame gambling.

1310
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:11,240
You Fuck 1200 bucks if you win more,
you guys supposed to pay taxes on it.

1311
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:17,530
You can claim losses too.
Which is how some gamblers get through 

1312
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:17,530
that,
but oh,

1313
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:17,840
you did claimed losses.
Yeah.

1314
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:22,841
They don't know.
You don't have to say how much you 

1315
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:22,841
gambled,
I think throughout a year.

1316
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:22,860
But if you get winnings you can also 
claim losses against it.

1317
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:25,540
Wow.
I didn't know that little trick.

1318
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,890
Write that down.
Yeah,

1319
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:31,900
it was.
It probably audit the fuck out if you 

1320
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:31,900
try to do that.
Do you think you're cute?

1321
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,720
Check this out.
Boom.

1322
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,260
Going deep in your asshole song.
Look of her receipts.

1323
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:39,880
Look of her receipts.
Do you bring your whole song?

1324
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:40,480
Yeah,
they.

1325
01:02:40,481 --> 01:02:43,730
They just have too much power.
They can shut your bank account's down.

1326
01:02:43,731 --> 01:02:48,650
They can shut your credit cards down.
They could take and take your money from

1327
01:02:48,651 --> 01:02:53,651
your boss before you go to court.
They can do a lot of stuff that they 

1328
01:02:53,651 --> 01:02:57,650
probably shouldn't be able to do,
but they have to get money from $350.

1329
01:02:57,651 --> 01:02:59,930
Million fucking people.
I mean how many paid taxes?

1330
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,530
Probably not 300 million.
Right.

1331
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,310
And there's so many people that told me 
they don't even do taxes.

1332
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,720
Like I don't do taxes.

1333
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,490
Well,
you're talking to like crazy comedians.

1334
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,570
It'll eventually get called exactly,
but you know,

1335
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:12,370
there was a big scandal in Boston that 
was one of the.

1336
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:17,520
Shouldn't say scandal was a dilemma.
It was a huge issue in Boston that I got

1337
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:22,521
to experience secondhand.
Fortunately with the old school 

1338
01:03:22,521 --> 01:03:24,810
comedians that were super successful 
there that didn't pay taxes,

1339
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,840
it was a giant issue because they got 
caught and one got caught and another 

1340
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,570
guy caught and then the irs people 
realized,

1341
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,600
oh,
none of these fucking comedians pay 

1342
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:35,600
taxes.
How much money these guys are making,

1343
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,700
because you'd go to like certain comedy 
clubs.

1344
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:39,000
It'd be the same guy like almost every 
weekend.

1345
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:44,001
They had like these deals,
like there were certain clubs like 

1346
01:03:44,001 --> 01:03:46,311
Nick's comedy stop was a big one.
They had deals with the best comics in 

1347
01:03:46,311 --> 01:03:48,030
town,
so if you went by Nick's comedy,

1348
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:53,031
stop on any given night in the late 
eighties you would see like Steve 

1349
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,340
Sweeney,
Don Gavin,

1350
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,330
they would be there every weekend,
so let's.

1351
01:03:57,331 --> 01:04:02,331
Places were packed.
They were all getting paid cash or 

1352
01:04:02,331 --> 01:04:04,941
cooking or originally God,
you have to say allegedly,

1353
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:07,230
allegedly.
I never got offered coke,

1354
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:11,040
but I also never got offered money.
I've never worked there.

1355
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:11,460
Really.

1356
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,270
I like,
I'm not going to say who,

1357
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:18,271
but a friend of ours,
like every time you guys just give me 

1358
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:18,271
cat.

1359
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:18,360
Yeah,
just give me cash.

1360
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,060
Cash.
What the fuck on.

1361
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,130
I think I might've worked there once or 
twice ever at Nick's,

1362
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:26,040
but I was never in the position where 
they get off your coke.

1363
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:31,150
I was,
wasn't in deep enough if I had worked 

1364
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,730
there was like a I emceed something and 
then I came back and worked there,

1365
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:37,731
but that was after like had agents and 
they handled the financial part of 

1366
01:04:37,731 --> 01:04:38,430
things like later,
later on.

1367
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:43,910
But those stories were always there.
Those guys get paid and coke and those 

1368
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:44,250
guys get,
you know,

1369
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:49,310
but they just fucking animals.
They were living like savages and they 

1370
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:49,310
weren't paying the taxes and they one by
one.

1371
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:54,231
They all got fucking thunderstruck and 
it was a worst case scenario because it 

1372
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:55,860
was like,
here's the comedy.

1373
01:04:55,861 --> 01:04:56,640
Boom.
Okay,

1374
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:01,970
here's like the eighties comedy boom 
where everybody's got rolled up sleeves 

1375
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:02,960
on fucking blazer and standing onstage.

1376
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,310
Did she ever notice and that everybody's
doing that,

1377
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:06,360
they're all killing it,
right?

1378
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,490
They're all over the evening at the 
Improv.

1379
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:12,240
Can't get enough talent because there's 
just not enough comedians.

1380
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,680
They just need.
They need more.

1381
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:15,870
They'll shows a huge people love,
like sitting in front of the TV,

1382
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:17,830
like vege not watched an evening at the 
Improv.

1383
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:21,010
So these comedy clubs explode all across
the country.

1384
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:26,011
I mean fucking explode.
But as Joey as likes to say that 

1385
01:05:26,011 --> 01:05:28,720
couldn't cover the spread,
they couldn't cover the spread.

1386
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:33,721
Joe Rogan.
People get tired of seeing the same 

1387
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,290
fucking act over and over again.
You're going out,

1388
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,830
you're buying a fucking babysitter.
And that's what happened.

1389
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:43,890
It died off.
So these guys made all their money in 

1390
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,200
the hay day and during the day they're 
young blown.

1391
01:05:45,201 --> 01:05:50,201
I bugged him,
Da da Da da every night killing.

1392
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,520
And I told her,
that's not my fucking Dick.

1393
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,480
The whole place goes crazy.
The world goes nuts.

1394
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:03,481
They'd fucking clink glasses at the bar.
After awhile they got a Mr Johnson.

1395
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:09,630
It's Mr Peterson from the irs would love
to have a word with you.

1396
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:15,020
Oh Shit.
And then they just go over the fact that

1397
01:06:15,481 --> 01:06:20,481
they audited the comedy club and the 
comedy club has all these comics on 

1398
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:22,620
roster,
you are amongst them.

1399
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:25,860
You made x amount of dollars,
we got paid zero.

1400
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:29,720
You owe as this plus a penalty,
which is that and you just.

1401
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:36,210
And the common cause of dried up and 
they're getting older and a lot of tired

1402
01:06:36,341 --> 01:06:41,341
that drinking and partying all the time,
you get worn out and then all of a 

1403
01:06:41,341 --> 01:06:41,470
sudden there's no more work.
The work dies off.

1404
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,950
You haven't really done the road so you 
don't have a national presence,

1405
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:49,951
you only have a local presence.
And then the fucking money guys come in 

1406
01:06:49,951 --> 01:06:54,461
and suck it out yet.
So I'm just going to hook the strap to 

1407
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:55,410
your spine,
pull the fluid out.

1408
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,960
I recently had to go through

1409
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,360
all my stuff too for the irs.
And it was.

1410
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:05,900
Nowadays it's a lot better though,
I guess than it used to be because if 

1411
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:05,900
you're,
say a comedian,

1412
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,480
uh,
you go through and you just go like,

1413
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:08,440
oh,
comedy store.

1414
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:10,060
I was at the comedy store,
I'm a comedian,

1415
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:15,390
you know,
and I go to the comedy store almost 

1416
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:15,400
every single day,
but you also realize that everything you

1417
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:20,401
do as a comic like that I could write 
off because the parking next door I can 

1418
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:25,771
ride off if I even get Netflix,
I could write that off because I'm 

1419
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:27,070
researching Netflix,
you know,

1420
01:07:27,071 --> 01:07:32,071
and,
and it's pretty amazing like how much 

1421
01:07:32,071 --> 01:07:34,770
you know you can write off and how much 
it's documented nowadays because 

1422
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:35,830
everyone's using their cards instead of 
paying cash for it.

1423
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,120
Right.
So it's,

1424
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:39,250
it's gotten better for comics,
I think,

1425
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:41,050
you know now.
But uh,

1426
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:46,051
yeah,
back then I couldn't even imagine just 

1427
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:46,051
having all those receipts and just being
like,

1428
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:46,051
no,
I swear this was for her,

1429
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:46,650
you know,
comedy,

1430
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:48,730
it's kind of screwy because if you're 
like a writer,

1431
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:53,731
you can do that to have your writer.
You can say that you're doing research 

1432
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:53,731
and you go to the movies

1433
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:53,731
[inaudible]

1434
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,700
I don't do that.
I don't know.

1435
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:01,980
I wouldn't.
This is something screwy about it 

1436
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:01,980
because like,
yeah,

1437
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:02,660
I guess you could write it off.
I guess it's research,

1438
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,400
but really you're just having fun at the
movies,

1439
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:05,960
aren't you?
You know

1440
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:06,690
[inaudible].

1441
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:10,600
I have this business lunches though.
I don't know if you've ever been on tons

1442
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:15,601
of advice to work in restaurants where 
people would come in and would use 

1443
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:16,250
friendship out of those credit and 
quarter stakes

1444
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,920
for 15 guys are sitting there drinking 
whiskey at lunch.

1445
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:21,430
Yeah,
but not talk about business.

1446
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:26,470
This business in the sense like say like
a Brian and I had a business opportunity

1447
01:08:26,471 --> 01:08:28,330
for you and we want you to get excited 
about it,

1448
01:08:28,331 --> 01:08:30,370
so we're going to take you out.
We're going to get you drunk,

1449
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,560
going to buy some steaks and we're going
to sit there and clink glasses together 

1450
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,301
and will feel a little loose.
We'll have some comradery because of 

1451
01:08:39,301 --> 01:08:42,121
this.
Booze will be feeling good and we'll go 

1452
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:42,121
like,
I like this venture.

1453
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:45,751
I think this could be really successful.
I think we're going to work well 

1454
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:48,031
together.
When I have a good fucking diamond 

1455
01:08:48,031 --> 01:08:48,031
click,
that's a real business

1456
01:08:48,031 --> 01:08:51,940
100 percent,
but like in a wolf of Wall Street where 

1457
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,581
they're sitting there in this data is 
looking through all their money they 

1458
01:08:54,581 --> 01:08:54,581
spent on hookers and whatnot.
You really had to spend $78,000

1459
01:08:54,581 --> 01:08:55,840
on data,
but like you could,

1460
01:08:55,860 --> 01:09:00,170
we could have had lunch at Mcdonald's or
subway instead of having it at,

1461
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:03,920
you know,
like the ivy or coy or whatever,

1462
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:06,230
and Sushi.
We could've just got food.

1463
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,870
Why did you have to spend $500?
You could have spent 100 right while you

1464
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:14,871
guys had to have all the crazy steaks 
and $500 bottles of wine to talk about 

1465
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:16,460
this meal.
It's the same kind of thought.

1466
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:18,800
Like what kind of fucking logic is that 
pussy.

1467
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:23,270
I'm just saying.
I'm crazy.

1468
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,180
Crazy.
It's been.

1469
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,240
It's been done plenty of times.
I've had friends that make their living 

1470
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:30,240
off of,
you're not going to impress me,

1471
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:30,730
but Jamie,

1472
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,190
what you're saying is ridiculous.
You're talking about some big,

1473
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,900
big business on a budget.
We could have gone to Mcdonald's

1474
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:39,600
supersized.
I'm just sort of making it,

1475
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:44,601
but like if you were going to spend $500
on the client when you can spend five,

1476
01:09:44,671 --> 01:09:47,730
well then don't spend any money on your 
research to make your job better.

1477
01:09:47,731 --> 01:09:52,731
Like just watch,
watch people at the park instead of 

1478
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:53,250
paying 10 bucks to get better quality 
research.

1479
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:58,280
You know what I mean?
That's all I'm sure that's to watch 

1480
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:58,280
people at the park.
It's free.

1481
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,800
It's free entertainment and taking in a 
movie I was making.

1482
01:10:01,801 --> 01:10:03,220
They look like a comics.
Good.

1483
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,560
No,
no.

1484
01:10:04,561 --> 01:10:08,280
I'm just saying as a comic looking for 
material you have.

1485
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:11,790
If you're going to make the argument of 
saying I need to get material,

1486
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,470
this is what I'm going to do to get my 
material.

1487
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,470
It could be anything you want to do.
You could talk about basketball.

1488
01:10:16,471 --> 01:10:20,160
You could talk about poker to a strip 
club joke in your at a park.

1489
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,410
Trying to think of strip clubs yet.
That's what I'm saying.

1490
01:10:22,411 --> 01:10:25,050
If you want to talk about strip clubs,
you have to go to a strip club.

1491
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:29,520
So at this business guy making this big 
deal deal at d at lunch.

1492
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,500
He said,
I have to go to this lunch and I have to

1493
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:34,170
spend this money because to try to 
impress my clients,

1494
01:10:34,171 --> 01:10:35,370
they can't impress,
not Mcdonald's.

1495
01:10:35,371 --> 01:10:40,371
There's just.
You can make the arguments if you want 

1496
01:10:40,371 --> 01:10:40,920
all day long for the thing that is 
needed for your business.

1497
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:45,950
Yeah.
That's the only thing I was trying to 

1498
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:45,950
say.

1499
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,900
Well,
you mean from the employer's point of 

1500
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,941
view of allowing this to happen or from 
the person who's the salesperson needs 

1501
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:53,000
to defend this action.
I suppose it's,

1502
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,240
yeah,
I,

1503
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:59,260
I could see both arguments,
but honestly I think for a lot of the 

1504
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:02,571
people that have those accounts,
like it's kind of important that they 

1505
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:05,721
formed these relationships.
That's why business launch is actually 

1506
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:08,601
an effective thing,
so I would think that a business lunch 

1507
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:08,601
is one of the rare exceptions of 
something that makes fun,

1508
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:11,040
that you write off or make sense rather 
that you write off.

1509
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:14,700
But I could see that movies make sense.
You know,

1510
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:17,690
like if you're a guy and you're a,
you're writing,

1511
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:20,880
you're a writer and you're writing a 
piece about modern horror movies,

1512
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:23,730
about the lack of modern horror movies.
Like if you're a modern,

1513
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:26,760
if you're a fan of horror movies,
fuck.

1514
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:31,761
You have to wait a long time.
How long do you have to wait for a good 

1515
01:11:31,761 --> 01:11:33,750
goddamn vampire movie?
Hold on for a werewolf movie,

1516
01:11:33,751 --> 01:11:36,570
it's every 30 years.
God Damn it.

1517
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:42,320
Every now and then they tease you like 
bleeding the ecl del Toro and that were 

1518
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:42,320
on the call,
but he's Atari.

1519
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,370
He's not going to fuck it up.
This is going to be amazing.

1520
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:49,020
They fucked up Benito del Toro and 
Anthony Hopkins and it's still blue.

1521
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:51,060
Nicholas?
Yeah.

1522
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:56,061
That was the worst with Michelle 
pfeiffer when she was so hot.

1523
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:02,120
I'll tell you every watched deliverance 
the other day.

1524
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:04,640
That's a horror movie.
I can't stop thinking about that.

1525
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,970
Squeal.
Like a pig seen.

1526
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,150
Ugh.
What a creepy,

1527
01:12:08,151 --> 01:12:12,170
realistic version of parts of life that 
goes on every single day.

1528
01:12:12,171 --> 01:12:13,460
Probably,
probably.

1529
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:14,270
Right.
That was a

1530
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:16,640
crazy ass movie man.
Is that Jack Nicholson?

1531
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:21,320
That is so dumb.
Why is his forehead have zero hair?

1532
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:22,480
Yeah,
he's.

1533
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,640
And when,
when he turns into a wolf man,

1534
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,410
there is.
He's the same size.

1535
01:12:27,411 --> 01:12:28,220
Everything.
It's like,

1536
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:30,770
well,
what do you have more teeth?

1537
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:32,270
Who's that though?
That's not,

1538
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,020
that's not him,
right?

1539
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,750
That's not Jack Nicholson.
I am.

1540
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,490
Is that a different one or is that 
another.

1541
01:12:36,491 --> 01:12:40,880
A scene in the movie like CGI,
Michelle Pfeiffer.

1542
01:12:40,881 --> 01:12:44,640
Jesus.
Who is that Jack made within?

1543
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,380
Yeah.
Oh,

1544
01:12:45,381 --> 01:12:50,381
that's what he looked like at the end.
So there was like stages of Werewolf 

1545
01:12:50,381 --> 01:12:51,590
dumb.
Remember this movie?

1546
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,170
This is eyes for something.
Oh,

1547
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:59,171
this is different.
Find out if there's a scene where you 

1548
01:12:59,171 --> 01:12:59,780
see what Jack Nicholson looked like.
I think it was called Wolf.

1549
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:03,260
It was really corny.
They like jumped in slow motion.

1550
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,310
Like whenever,
like you're showing slow motion.

1551
01:13:07,311 --> 01:13:08,300
First of all,
you fucked up.

1552
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:11,990
Horror movies should be about two 
seconds scenes like,

1553
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,780
like alien,
like the first movie alien was perfect.

1554
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:19,781
You rarely get to see the alien and when
you did see it it was like when he was a

1555
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:24,560
perfect movie in that sense.
When you see in Jack Nicholson,

1556
01:13:24,561 --> 01:13:28,100
who looks exactly like Jack Nicholson 
with a thicker beard,

1557
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:32,720
he looks like a Jack Nicholson.
That would be a Barista in a handcrafted

1558
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:35,570
coffee place in Seattle.
That's how fucking furry.

1559
01:13:35,571 --> 01:13:37,880
He is.
Always get slightly bigger teeth,

1560
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:41,510
which by the way you can buy,
just like you can buy dental implants,

1561
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:46,690
you can buy those slightly bigger teeth.
So you essentially could look fucking 

1562
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,830
exactly like Jack Nicholson in this 
stupid wolf movie.

1563
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:54,100
You could get some fake eyes where you 
put contacts on that make you look 

1564
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,010
scary.
And uh,

1565
01:13:55,011 --> 01:13:59,180
so he's jumping in slow motion.
And as each jumping in slow motion,

1566
01:13:59,181 --> 01:14:02,150
you realize like that's just like a 
person's body and something,

1567
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:05,600
even though it's not even weird.
It's just a guy like this,

1568
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:11,740
these peanut here.
Remember this movie he peed on James 

1569
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,130
Spader never.
James before he was in this

1570
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:16,280
new fucking bullshit show isn't.
Huh?

1571
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,310
That doesn't look like James Spader at 
all.

1572
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,100
Was it super?
Nah,

1573
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:22,900
I'm just saying he's way too young.
I guess this old thing go spader.

1574
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,210
That's 1984,
right?

1575
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,580
I'm not disagreeing.
I'm just saying is it 84 and 94?

1576
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:28,720
Nineteen 94.
Sorry.

1577
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,100
Wow.
Ninety four.

1578
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:34,480
Let's see what the wolf part of them 
looks like because it was really bad.

1579
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:40,680
I wish I was.
I wish I was like friends with the 

1580
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,040
people who are doing that.
Moving back when it was happening,

1581
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:43,810
I'd be like,
oh,

1582
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:46,900
she does whatever.
How bad is this going to look?

1583
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,760
Come on.
What is she doing?

1584
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:51,640
She's running as the wolf.
Did we miss the transition?

1585
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:54,220
That's like half the Werewolf movie,
man.

1586
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:57,940
Have you got to like Loan Cheney?
See Loan Chaney Jr.

1587
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,820
He had an excuse.
Go to tHe wolf man.

1588
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,130
The old wolf.
and look at james spader down there.

1589
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,690
Look at that handsome wolfelt's.
Look at him.

1590
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:07,480
Look at him.
See that crazy.

1591
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:09,190
That's that dude.
Isn't that blacklist show?

1592
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:14,680
So he drinks a lot of water.
Now go back.

1593
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:18,220
Okay.
Just google loan cheney.

1594
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:23,221
The wolf man.
So that was the wolf man from 2010 that 

1595
01:15:23,221 --> 01:15:23,221
you just pulled up.
Which is pretty fun.

1596
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:28,620
I put it on the background sometimes 
when I'm writing just because it's like 

1597
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,530
visually it's kind of interesting.
What if the top one,

1598
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,580
the top one that's loan cheney as the 
werewolf.

1599
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:36,510
So this is like find out what year this 
is man,

1600
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:38,560
because this is like,
oh,

1601
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:40,270
this is just a,
an award show.

1602
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,420
Um,
he's the classic wolf man.

1603
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:45,790
Now.
See like the monster mash and stuff?

1604
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,620
Well,
it was so goofy.

1605
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:53,120
It claude rains.
Nineteen 41 go full screen.

1606
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,310
This is exciting.
So this is a trailer for a movie back in

1607
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:01,690
the time where they didn't even have 
trailers.

1608
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,460
Somebody must've made this after the 
fact.

1609
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:06,600
Probably as the wolf man do the

1610
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:14,930
Got bitten by a werewolf.
the werewolf himself don't hand me that.

1611
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,090
You're jusT wasting your time.
It will meet you.

1612
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,600
Don't hand me that.
You wouldn't want to run away with a 

1613
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:33,291
murder.
I killed it.

1614
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:38,000
I killed records.
If I stay here any longer,

1615
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:38,740
you can tell

1616
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:47,650
these special effects.
Good lord.

1617
01:16:47,651 --> 01:16:52,330
Look At girls yelling.
Sparely fighting.

1618
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,410
Just kinda gave up.
She was psyched.

1619
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,260
The blood lust of a savage beast though.
Both.

1620
01:17:02,261 --> 01:17:02,980
Man.

1621
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,510
I wonder if that's a real trailer of a 
fan created.

1622
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:08,940
It looks like a real trailer.
It does,

1623
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,360
but I think they had trailers.
Did they have?

1624
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,460
Yeah.
Nineteen 41.

1625
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:14,450
Yeah.
They had trailers back then.

1626
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:15,740
Did that.
Really?

1627
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,030
Absolutely.
Oh wow.

1628
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:19,820
I didn't think they did man.
I know that for some movies,

1629
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:21,820
like when you go to itunes and you,
uh,

1630
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,770
you go to click on trailer for some,
like really shitty movies.

1631
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:27,290
They don't really have a trailer.
They Just take a chunk of the movie,

1632
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:30,500
like stick it in there.
It gives a fucking piece of shit movie.

1633
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,820
I did that the other day with some 
horror movie and I tried to watch it and

1634
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:35,130
I said,
let me see what the trailer is.

1635
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,810
The traiLer wasn't a trailer at all.
It was just like they just took a snip.

1636
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,400
What do you want?
Like four minutes.

1637
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,140
how long you want the trailer?
Five minutes.

1638
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,580
Not five minutes in particular.
It's a good five titty.

1639
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,640
If I did,
didn't put that in there.

1640
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,560
I mean that's a super common thing.
I didn't know that.

1641
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,650
I wonder what year they invented the 
trailer.

1642
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,570
Have you had to guess?
40 six,

1643
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:58,610
46.
Well that's 41.

1644
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,420
30 six.
He six.

1645
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,480
It certainly looks like a real trailer.
Like those fonts.

1646
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:07,580
Perfect.
But how bad is the acting?

1647
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:09,380
Even with them?

1648
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:14,380
Murderer.
There's bad acting and movies that I 

1649
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:14,380
thought were amazing 10 years ago.
First

1650
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:19,160
shown us fiLm theater in 1913.
Whoa.

1651
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:22,080
That's amazing.
Wow.

1652
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:26,460
And we've been fucked ever since then.
advertising should be illegal,

1653
01:18:26,461 --> 01:18:31,180
right?
It's still easy.

1654
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:34,290
It'll fuck with our heads.
I like trailers more than I like movies.

1655
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,870
How about that?
Because it's a fucking juicy,

1656
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,920
Like they figured out how to make it 
into little sound bite.

1657
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:46,390
That's what happened with suicide squad.
Apparently they made that cool trailer 

1658
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,240
that came out earlier last year and 
everyone really liked that.

1659
01:18:48,241 --> 01:18:51,110
And uh,
the war on warner brotherS company lists

1660
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:56,120
what I read,
they were afraid it wasn't going to be 

1661
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:56,120
that cool.
I wasn't going to look like that.

1662
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:00,301
It wasn't going to deliver on that 
promise when they're also freaked out 

1663
01:19:00,301 --> 01:19:02,631
because of batman and superman that had 
failed so hard that they hired that 

1664
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:05,961
company that made that trailer to re 
edit the movie that the director was 

1665
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:05,961
making at the same time they were making
it,

1666
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:10,761
so there's two cuts going around the 
same time and then they molded them 

1667
01:19:10,761 --> 01:19:12,780
together at the end of the summer.
Too many cooks too much come.

1668
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:16,230
They too much in the egg drop soup.
They actually added jokes.

1669
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:19,170
They had to reshoot a lot of stuff to 
add more humor to it.

1670
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:24,171
They ended it out the joker completely,
but all you know is that the director's 

1671
01:19:24,171 --> 01:19:27,740
cuts probably.
They edited out the joker with jared 

1672
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,500
leto.
They edited a lot of the joker up.

1673
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:30,510
Most of the joker.
He's barely in that movie.

1674
01:19:30,511 --> 01:19:32,070
I really.
I refuse to watch.

1675
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:32,880
You heard.
No,

1676
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:33,450
no.
I read it.

1677
01:19:33,451 --> 01:19:34,230
I ride him.
He read

1678
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,290
so true.
He complained about it to.

1679
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,400
Oh man,
he's not even in the poster.

1680
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,460
He look dope.
Did you notice that he's not even in the

1681
01:19:42,461 --> 01:19:44,180
post or one of the main characters as 
well?

1682
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:48,490
In all fairness,
who the fuck knows what happened?

1683
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:52,990
You know this jared leto character?
Who knows what kind of wacky shenanigans

1684
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:55,740
he was up to.
He was going to send an.

1685
01:19:55,741 --> 01:19:58,660
We're doing weird stuff for the cast and
character the whole time.

1686
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,700
Oh,
was he pissed them off?

1687
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:04,120
I don't know about the cast.
He was just supposedly who's just became

1688
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,550
an issue.
I don't know if that happened.

1689
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:06,460
Yeah,
there you go.

1690
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:07,560
I can that coming.

1691
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:12,600
I read somewhere.
I don't know if it's true if will smith 

1692
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,890
saying that I didn't research it,
but I read that will smith hates him and

1693
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,550
he like,
like publicly said he hates him.

1694
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,750
Jared leto.
Yeah.

1695
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:21,760
Wow.
If willsmith hates you,

1696
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:27,090
but I don't know if it's true though 
about the rock yesterday coming out 

1697
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:27,090
publicly talking about it.
Fast and furious.

1698
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:31,660
Eight cast mates that were being divas 
onset when it was causing a big rift and

1699
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:34,560
all of his classmates and closed like 
kurt russell's tyrese,

1700
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,090
a vin diesel obviously isn't it?
A couple of people.

1701
01:20:37,091 --> 01:20:40,090
He didn't publicly say who it was,
but the way it came out,

1702
01:20:40,091 --> 01:20:45,091
it was like an instagram post and so 
everyone got a hounding all of his 

1703
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:47,530
classmates asking who it was and what 
was really going on.

1704
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,760
It turns out it was vin diesel and they 
like had it out in his trailer 

1705
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:52,870
yesterday.
What was going on with vin diesel?

1706
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:55,810
He's showing up late to set.
He's a producer on the movie though too,

1707
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:59,920
so he's done.
It makes a lot of money on these movies.

1708
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:01,230
Yeah,
he wear sunglasses

1709
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:06,300
side.
That's always the weirdest thing with 

1710
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,490
sunglasses.
You can do that.

1711
01:21:07,491 --> 01:21:12,491
If you're p diddy,
there's like certain people that can do 

1712
01:21:12,491 --> 01:21:12,491
that.
You can't do that.

1713
01:21:12,491 --> 01:21:14,990
Vin vin diesel this fast.
Eight p,

1714
01:21:14,991 --> 01:21:18,470
if it was reportedly vin diesel.
The rock was calling a candy ass.

1715
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:23,530
This is the best fire up promotion of a 
film that has diesel's a large 

1716
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:27,431
gentleman,
but I would bet everything I've ever 

1717
01:21:27,431 --> 01:21:27,431
made on the gentleman to the right with 
a goatee,

1718
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:29,240
like everything,
everything.

1719
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:32,900
I know me too.
I've ever made my life the future of the

1720
01:21:32,901 --> 01:21:36,410
world itself.
I bet it on the rock.

1721
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,280
The rocks.
Awesome.

1722
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:37,820
He's,
well,

1723
01:21:37,821 --> 01:21:40,190
he's an inspirational character too.
Like,

1724
01:21:40,191 --> 01:21:42,800
um,
he's a dude who gets up in the fuck.

1725
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,780
What does it say?
The rock walks back,

1726
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,110
his name calling,
but vin diesel lives for drama.

1727
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:49,730
Hmm.
I don't know what that means.

1728
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,060
He said he may maybe just relaxed and 
said,

1729
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:54,890
what am I doing?
Why am I wasting my time here?

1730
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:55,830
It is.
Why?

1731
01:21:55,850 --> 01:22:00,850
I mean,
he's the number one most highly paid 

1732
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:01,220
actor in the world.
He's number one.

1733
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:02,630
So,
uh,

1734
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:06,290
you know,
this is going to be drama.

1735
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:10,310
There's going to be people that fuck 
with you when you're number one.

1736
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,300
There's that.
There's gonna be issues you have working

1737
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:13,940
with some dude.

1738
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:17,260
And there's also probably a lot of 
bullshit stories that are put into the,

1739
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:22,120
into the tmzs just so you have some 
prior advertising of a movie that no one

1740
01:22:22,121 --> 01:22:23,710
even knew it was being filmed.
You know,

1741
01:22:23,711 --> 01:22:26,050
This isn't even a tmc.
Right?

1742
01:22:26,051 --> 01:22:27,820
This was his own instagram page.
So it was,

1743
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,680
you can say that they're doing it on 
purpose.

1744
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:30,490
Yeah.
I mean,

1745
01:22:30,491 --> 01:22:32,860
especially the rocks is such a prankster
anyways,

1746
01:22:32,861 --> 01:22:33,790
you know,
so it's,

1747
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:35,440
that's a good point.
That's good point.

1748
01:22:35,441 --> 01:22:37,870
Call to do to candy as does sound like 
pro wrestling talk.

1749
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,490
I don't trust anything anymore.
Like for,

1750
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,890
for the longest time I don't trust.
I don't.

1751
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:43,930
I used to think rotten tomatoes was 
completely legit.

1752
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:48,931
Right.
but then you start seeing movies on 

1753
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:48,931
rotten tomatoes and you're like,
I saw that movie.

1754
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:49,120
There's no way.
That's a 98 percent.

1755
01:22:49,121 --> 01:22:51,220
How in the fuck is that?
Ninety eight percent.

1756
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:55,550
Then I heard from somebody that they 
only pick the top comic art.

1757
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:58,920
Our top reviewers,
uh,

1758
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,120
they don't use the same reviewers for 
every movie.

1759
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:06,240
So like they'll have like 10 top 
reviewers for this movie and only five 

1760
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:06,240
for this movie.

1761
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:09,370
Like they're almost picking and choosing
them mean and we're talking about.

1762
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:13,030
We found out that it's like who owns 
rotten tomatoes?

1763
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:17,410
And viacom ownS rotten tomatoes come up.
Fandango.

1764
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:23,220
Fandango is owned by universal and 
universal is owned by comcast and 

1765
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,690
universal and universal and sony like.
Anyways,

1766
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:30,780
so that come to the terrordome come on 
down and all that,

1767
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:36,340
all that fucking thing is is selling tv 
shows and movies that have.

1768
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:37,650
They make those.
Okay,

1769
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:40,540
but doesn't rotten tomatoes operate 
under user?

1770
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:44,140
Like use your criticism say let's say 
like it uses the top reviewers.

1771
01:23:44,141 --> 01:23:49,141
Yeah.
Like there's 100 reviewers that they 

1772
01:23:49,141 --> 01:23:49,141
choose from.
They choose from.

1773
01:23:49,141 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah.
They don't use the same reviewers for 

1774
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,000
every movie I've been looking like,
like,

1775
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,550
like,
like say like you're recommend a minimum

1776
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:58,300
wage.
So you're saying they choose a review as

1777
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:59,230
well.
The same reviewers,

1778
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:00,490
they're not reviewing every movie.

1779
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:05,490
Are they?
Is there like an an industry and 

1780
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:05,490
reviewing things?
Well,

1781
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:06,790
what if you look at say like,
let's see what movies come out.

1782
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:09,970
Sausage party right now.
Look at the who's reviewed that movie?

1783
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:13,120
TheN look at a movie that's also opening
this friday.

1784
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,250
See how many of those reviewers are the 
same?

1785
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:17,300
They're not the same reviewers.
One the time.

1786
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:22,320
One hundred percent.
Many people reviewing a movie on rotten 

1787
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,101
tomatoes,
like when they give those tomato 

1788
01:24:26,101 --> 01:24:26,101
numbers,
how many people are doing that?

1789
01:24:26,101 --> 01:24:27,730
We thousands.
No,

1790
01:24:27,731 --> 01:24:28,630
they only.
Well,

1791
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,320
they have user reviews and then they 
have like professional reviewers,

1792
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:35,200
85,
74 reviews.

1793
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,520
Right,
right.

1794
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:39,220
Wait a minute.
Oh,

1795
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,870
this is a critic's consensus.
Yes.

1796
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,600
And the minute it wasn't always that 
way.

1797
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:48,720
Yes.
And separated through critics and then 

1798
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,121
use the reviews and there's been like a 
separate icon that you're supposed to 

1799
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:52,540
pay attention.
I was just gO to the app.

1800
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:58,100
Right.
And then if you scroll down now if you 

1801
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:58,100
scroll down,
they have lights.

1802
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,920
Actually yelp go to the yelp app.
But I'm good at rotten tomatoes was even

1803
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:02,370
have an app.
Do they make that up?

1804
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,130
yeah,
they did.

1805
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:07,510
But then they have like the reverse.
And then a lot of these reviewers,

1806
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:10,420
there's somebody that actually chooses 
if it's rotten or not.

1807
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:12,040
I clicked on a few of these,
uh,

1808
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:17,220
like what they're called fresh reviews 
where it's supposed to be positive 

1809
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,340
review and then they go through it.
You're like,

1810
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:23,580
how did they get positive from this?
This sounds like they were kind of on 

1811
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:23,580
the fence,
like a 50 slash 50 percent,

1812
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,210
you know?
But then it's like all,

1813
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,990
none of it makes real sense.
There's no real math on this at all.

1814
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:34,020
It's it's,
it's pretty bullshit because there's 

1815
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:34,330
been a few interesting that you Just 
pointed that out.

1816
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,820
Yeah.
It's interestinG that that's critics.

1817
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:41,930
Yeah.
I really thought that the whole purpose 

1818
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:42,130
of those things was reviewers being 
regular peopLe.

1819
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:47,300
Yeah.
If you look at it like a site like 

1820
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:48,871
metacritic,
that seems like it's a little bit less 

1821
01:25:48,871 --> 01:25:51,751
bias and a more faCtual and that makes 
more sense because there's been so many 

1822
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:53,380
movies on your lately.
I've been like,

1823
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,990
That's impossible that that's a 90 
percent.

1824
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:56,770
Yeah,
because you could,

1825
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,230
if you had a movie,
you could just use these guys.

1826
01:25:59,231 --> 01:26:01,590
Take them to business.
Lunch plank length,

1827
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:04,720
a credit card.
I just went to their website and they're

1828
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:08,490
owned by cbs interactive.
Nevermind.

1829
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,390
God it.
I had no idea that that's interact.

1830
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:18,400
If you motherfuckers that's viacom were 
buttons sold.

1831
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:22,400
Ladies and gentlemen look like,
look at this now.

1832
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:27,401
If you go to this one and look at the 
same movies like sausage party or 

1833
01:26:27,401 --> 01:26:27,830
whatever it is,
it won't match up.

1834
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,920
Shouldn't they match up?
If they both do the exact same fucking 

1835
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:32,920
thing in their own farm,
the same company.

1836
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,100
Oh,
I hate life.

1837
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,860
That owned by the same company.
One of them is owned by cbs.

1838
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,200
The other one is owned by universal.
Right.

1839
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:44,860
But yet notice how many.
How many reviewers on this one compared 

1840
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:47,651
to how many reviewers on the one that's 
universal with sony universal work 

1841
01:26:47,651 --> 01:26:47,651
together if not owned by the same 
company.

1842
01:26:47,651 --> 01:26:48,710
Right.
How many different.

1843
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:51,140
What is the.
Was the numbers for metacritic?

1844
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:54,630
Seventy four versus would've met a 
critical

1845
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,010
less.
Yeah.

1846
01:27:02,011 --> 01:27:03,900
This is for critic reviews.
They have 27,

1847
01:27:03,901 --> 01:27:04,400
six,
30,

1848
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,490
34 or so,
just 34.

1849
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:10,890
So my folks,
we had to get medicated.

1850
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:16,100
So metacritic is not the same pool as 
rotten tomatoes where all these extra 

1851
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:20,960
reviewers coming from.
Rotten tomatoes on a movie that you guys

1852
01:27:20,961 --> 01:27:22,950
are a bunch of people that are,
you know,

1853
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:23,960
look,
if you had,

1854
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,220
let's say there's a network,
right?

1855
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,740
Like okay,
there's a network of podcasters,

1856
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:33,830
right?
We're all kind of whether or not we're 

1857
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:33,830
networked together

1858
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:33,830
officially.
We're all connected,

1859
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:34,660
right?
Well,

1860
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:39,680
you know,
kind of movie reviewer type characters 

1861
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,950
that are like online movie movie 
reviewer dudes.

1862
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,150
If they say,
hey man,

1863
01:27:42,151 --> 01:27:43,950
you want to get in with this rotten 
tomatoes thing,

1864
01:27:43,951 --> 01:27:44,660
it's really cool.
You just,

1865
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,000
you have to go to seven movies a week 
and get paid really well and you just 

1866
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,340
write these little things about it and 
you know,

1867
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,220
you're encouraged to support the big 
ones.

1868
01:27:53,221 --> 01:27:58,221
Just be fair in your criticism.
You don't have to make things up if you 

1869
01:27:58,221 --> 01:27:58,221
don't like something,
just be fair.

1870
01:27:58,221 --> 01:27:58,710
Okay,
cool.

1871
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,780
And then you go in there and then you 
got steady money.

1872
01:28:00,781 --> 01:28:03,360
You got steady money coming your Way.
I don't know how much it is,

1873
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:06,480
but I would imagine a company like 
rotten tomatoes,

1874
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:10,230
which you've used,
I've used so many people have used to to

1875
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,040
see a movie.
They probably makes a cash,

1876
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,170
right?
Oh yeah.

1877
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,630
Have to.
They have to.

1878
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:16,720
Everybody knows it.
Yeah.

1879
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:18,530
Who doesn't know about rotten tomatoes,
right?

1880
01:28:18,850 --> 01:28:23,850
I mean they advertise movies on rotten 
tomatoes that they judge that same kind 

1881
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:24,580
of weird.
Well,

1882
01:28:24,581 --> 01:28:28,420
the problem is even if it was like 
totally legit in the beginning,

1883
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,630
right after,
which I believe someone that comes along

1884
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:34,660
with you,
like even the fertittas sold the ufc.

1885
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:39,750
Okay.
Just be aware lIke it's at a certain 

1886
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:39,850
point in time,
no matter how rich you are,

1887
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,440
someone comes along with a good number.

1888
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:43,680
Okay.
Okay.

1889
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:44,690
Say,
okay,

1890
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,400
so,
uh,

1891
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,510
we'll still be able to review movies.
I can be honest.

1892
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:49,910
You can be fair.
Can you be fair?

1893
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,500
I can be fair.
have you ever be fair?

1894
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:53,830
Let's do this.
Let's go on a business level.

1895
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:54,950
Yeah.

1896
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:57,300
Exynos chip.
Stay.

1897
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,000
No.
Mcdonald's.

1898
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:00,870
kayla.

1899
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,110
We're going to be a business forever.
We,

1900
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:07,530
we're going to die some day.
We're not dying,

1901
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:10,470
bro.
We're not fucking die and we're going to

1902
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:15,471
take hormones and we're going to go to a
fucking doctor in Brazil and he's going 

1903
01:29:15,471 --> 01:29:16,710
to shoot us up at the same shit that 
they shot up.

1904
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,870
Michelle pfeiffer when she looks 
perfect,

1905
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:22,380
she looks really similar to how she 
looks in that wolf

1906
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:24,910
go math right now.
I just saw her in person.

1907
01:29:24,911 --> 01:29:26,980
The other Is 12.
She's 12 years old.

1908
01:29:26,981 --> 01:29:30,730
She's so small and so tiny person.
what's wrong with you that you know,

1909
01:29:30,731 --> 01:29:31,490
it's so weird.
I,

1910
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,190
I,
they really gave me.

1911
01:29:33,191 --> 01:29:36,370
I got to go to the sausage party premier
and I got to be on like the red carpet,

1912
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,110
all the celebrities and stuff and it was
really,

1913
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:40,750
it was my first time ever doing 
something like that level,

1914
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:45,990
but I got to see everyone in person that
I've always seen like selena gomez and 

1915
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:45,990
and that.
josh,

1916
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:50,550
what's that guy's name again?
Josh from limitless or Joseph Gordon 

1917
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:50,550
levitt,
george.

1918
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,520
All these guys that I've seen so many 
times.

1919
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:55,960
They're so small and like in real life,
it's so weird seeing them.

1920
01:29:55,961 --> 01:29:57,840
They seem like little versions of 
everyone.

1921
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,460
It's so cool.
It's cool and interesting.

1922
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:01,700
Well,
you're not a big guy.

1923
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:02,690
Yeah,
my side.

1924
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:03,340
Yeah,
I know.

1925
01:30:03,341 --> 01:30:04,420
But you,
you think,

1926
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,950
I guess because you think of them as 
superheroes,

1927
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:12,270
you know,
and a lot of these movies and stuff 

1928
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:12,270
that,
that

1929
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:12,270
if I had a dollar for every time someone
said,

1930
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:13,620
you're shorter than I thought you'd be 
to me,

1931
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:18,590
I'd have $100.
$100.

1932
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,710
I'm not kidding.
Right.

1933
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:20,430
Michael?
Sarah,

1934
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:22,290
by the way,
he was the weirdest guy.

1935
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,010
Michael.
Sarah,

1936
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:27,560
who's a kick ass.
Is that it's called that guy or no?

1937
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,430
No.
Scott pilgrim.

1938
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:30,960
Remember scott pilgrim?
Oh yeah.

1939
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,370
He was weird.
Yeah,

1940
01:30:32,371 --> 01:30:32,760
he.
Well,

1941
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,390
he just looked guys weird.
You always.

1942
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,020
He just has a weird vibe domain.
It's like a.

1943
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:38,820
It's probably a little uncomfortable.
That's why he's funny.

1944
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,080
Yeah.
Hipster like homeless.

1945
01:30:40,081 --> 01:30:45,081
Hipster.
That's what he looked like in the 

1946
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:45,081
sixties.
That dude is so funny.

1947
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:49,070
I love that guy.
I think that whenever someone's at 

1948
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:49,440
funny,
I always assumed that something going on

1949
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:52,160
some kind of crazy.
You know?

1950
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:54,360
He's that funny.
He's a funny fucking guy,

1951
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:55,530
man.
Absolutely.

1952
01:30:55,531 --> 01:30:57,780
Kick ass.
It's still one of my or not.

1953
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,220
Not kept pilgrims.
Scott pilgrim.

1954
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,380
Yeah,
it's super bad.

1955
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:05,690
Super bad is my favorite.
It's like that scene when jonah hill's 

1956
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:07,800
just drawn dixon school.
I remember I was literally like lie.

1957
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:12,890
I watched it by myself and I was lying 
sideways on my couch kicking and 

1958
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:16,790
paddling in the air,
like drawing,

1959
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:22,540
like why you keep drawing?
That's something I would totally have 

1960
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:23,820
done.
I still do it.

1961
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:25,300
To this day,
half the nopa.

1962
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,300
This has no.
David choe,

1963
01:31:27,301 --> 01:31:29,250
Whatever david chosen here.
He's drawing dicks.

1964
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,500
Yeah,
I love that.

1965
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:34,230
He's got all different colored tags.

1966
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,130
So perfect.
Dick's,

1967
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,400
dick's,
boobs and eyeballs were my three.

1968
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,040
Was it jonah hill that did it?
It wasn't him.

1969
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:45,360
It was jonah hill.
God,

1970
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:46,800
it's so fucking funny,
man.

1971
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,090
So jonah hill?
Yep.

1972
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,790
Cool.
Sausage party.

1973
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:52,440
Funny.
Be honest.

1974
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:54,520
Don't rotten tomatoes falling out.
I'll tell you the tell you the

1975
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:59,520
full truth.
I've been waiting for this movie for a 

1976
01:31:59,520 --> 01:31:59,520
long ass time because it's kind of like 
a dream movie,

1977
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,990
a pixar movie and having a dirty,
like an old fritz,

1978
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:03,210
the cat or something.
Right.

1979
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:05,320
And you know,
there's a couple of scenes in there that

1980
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:06,790
kind of our fun,
very,

1981
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:09,070
very fun to watch.
But overall it just,

1982
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,610
it was just like having a kids movie 
where they cussed at and it was like,

1983
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,590
you know,
really kind of like,

1984
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,180
oh god,
oh jeez.

1985
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:17,770
Oh my.
I got bored.

1986
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:22,860
That was the biggest thing.
I just got really bored while watching 

1987
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,381
it and I was not expecting.
I was expecting that to be the best way 

1988
01:32:25,381 --> 01:32:25,381
to get tattoo of it on my arm or 
something,

1989
01:32:25,381 --> 01:32:25,960
but no,
it was,

1990
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:29,920
it was one of the biggest letdowns I've 
ever had and the rotten tomatoes,

1991
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:34,950
that's called reality.
Internet's coming for your son and I 

1992
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:35,070
love seth rogen movies.
That's my favorites.

1993
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,820
Like,
like if there was a Class of movie,

1994
01:32:37,821 --> 01:32:39,700
if seth rogen movies are my top 
favorite,

1995
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:44,701
but it just didn't like it was cheesy,
like they called the juice juice and 

1996
01:32:44,701 --> 01:32:45,550
there's like all these like things Where
you're just like,

1997
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,350
oh god.
It's like open mic night.

1998
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:52,840
Oh man.
Brian coming down hard on the sausage 

1999
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:52,990
party.
Yeah,

2000
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,280
I mean I,
I really,

2001
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:57,350
maybe I was just a little bit of a 
correction.

2002
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,470
Maybe I waS just in the mood.
I will definitely watch it again and see

2003
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:05,471
if it.
It seemed like a kids movie where they 

2004
01:33:05,471 --> 01:33:07,631
cussed and it's pretty much like if I'm 
going to do the first or like a new 

2005
01:33:07,631 --> 01:33:11,260
version of like an adult cartoon I'm 
going to show or nudity,

2006
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:14,600
I'm going to get that nc 17 rating.
I don't get on underrating.

2007
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:16,410
I'm going,
I'm going deep.

2008
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,720
Okay.
You know,

2009
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,270
but you know,
that's not what they were trying to do.

2010
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:21,770
I mean,
they,

2011
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,890
they do it in movie.
Spoiler alert.

2012
01:33:25,550 --> 01:33:26,460
You don't,
don't,

2013
01:33:26,490 --> 01:33:27,680
don't,
don't.

2014
01:33:27,681 --> 01:33:30,200
I'll change it.
Then the movie ends very graphic.

2015
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:36,620
Does it end.
Is graphic is like team America world 

2016
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:36,620
police when they're fucking.

2017
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:39,880
It goes over it.
But imagine if it was made for cinemax.

2018
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,090
Oh,
okay.

2019
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:43,120
I've seen nipple,
but no,

2020
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,700
no lips.
These are all just pieces of lettuce and

2021
01:33:45,701 --> 01:33:46,970
tacos and stuff.
Oh,

2022
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,490
there's,
that's what I'm saying.

2023
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:50,230
They should have.
Don't say anymore.

2024
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:55,470
You've already confused me enough where 
I can forget what you said and you just 

2025
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:56,890
cross it off to you being you.
Right.

2026
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:59,000
But no,
I mean it's unfortunate.

2027
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,060
You know what man?
It's.

2028
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:04,300
Did you see ghostbusters?
Fuck no.

2029
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:06,430
Okay.
Here's,

2030
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:07,990
here's my thinking.
Did you?

2031
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:08,610
Yes,
I did.

2032
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,060
God,
my girls want to see it.

2033
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:15,061
All right.
It's perfect movie for her year old 

2034
01:34:15,061 --> 01:34:17,101
girl.
It's a perfect movie for an eight year 

2035
01:34:17,101 --> 01:34:17,101
old girl.
That's my review.

2036
01:34:17,101 --> 01:34:18,700
Had she seen the original kind of scary.
She doesn't have to.

2037
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:24,120
Here's the thing about.
Here's the thing about watching 

2038
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,840
ghostbusters in new form,
if the original didn't exist,

2039
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:28,660
it's kind of a fun movie.
It's stupid.

2040
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:31,480
There's some giant leaps.
There's some.

2041
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:35,290
There's some kind of clunky writing,
but there's also some funny shit.

2042
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:39,840
There's some funny moment I heard it was
all man hating and ends with not all man

2043
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,680
hating,
but definitely a lot of man hating.

2044
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:45,340
There was definitely every move.
Every dude in the movie was a dork,

2045
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:49,450
but it's not the only one who was really
unbelievable that.

2046
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:51,100
Well,
like literally wasn't believable.

2047
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,620
Was chris hemsworth the guy?
Yeah,

2048
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,690
it was awesome.
It was really good.

2049
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:57,350
I heard it was awesome.
It was really funny,

2050
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,150
but he's

2051
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:03,160
so stupid in the movie that it's 
unbelievable and these girls are like 

2052
01:35:04,361 --> 01:35:06,590
constantly enamored with him in love 
with them,

2053
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:10,430
but they can't believe how dumb he is 
and that's like sort of this running gag

2054
01:35:10,431 --> 01:35:12,320
to the point where it's almost 
ridiculous.

2055
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,550
But here's what I think.
I think if that bothers you,

2056
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:20,780
what kind of a bitch are you like that's
really bothering you?

2057
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:25,781
That these women are shitting on men to 
the point where they're taking chris 

2058
01:35:25,781 --> 01:35:26,750
hemsworth and they're making them dumb 
kit at all.

2059
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:28,250
The dumb bitches that had been in 
movies.

2060
01:35:28,251 --> 01:35:30,470
Can't we have one movie where these 
three,

2061
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:35,910
you know,
not so good looking girls take over the 

2062
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:36,690
fucking world and,
and save everybody and,

2063
01:35:36,691 --> 01:35:41,691
and have the dudes be all fucked up 
looking or a or a mass or crazy or chris

2064
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:45,980
hemsworth and chris hemsworth was 
perfect and beautiful.

2065
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:51,250
Also like the dumbest human being that's
ever walked the face of the planet and 

2066
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:51,710
an actor showing his head shots like the
whole deal.

2067
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:56,710
You like super cliche.
So I never go to the movies anymore 

2068
01:35:56,710 --> 01:36:00,790
because of the problem I'm having with 
things like ghostbusters though and 

2069
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:01,280
stuff where the hype doesn't live up to 
the movie.

2070
01:36:01,281 --> 01:36:04,400
The movie sucks so bad.
I can't believe I didn't have to suck.

2071
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,540
That was my point.
Yeah.

2072
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:10,570
It didn't have to suck,
but like there was some funny shit in 

2073
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:13,031
the movie.
I don't want to give away any parts of 

2074
01:36:13,031 --> 01:36:13,031
it.
Were there,

2075
01:36:13,031 --> 01:36:14,570
there was some like clever turns in the 
beginning of the movie where I laughed.

2076
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:15,110
I was like,
this,

2077
01:36:15,111 --> 01:36:16,280
this is funny.
This is funny,

2078
01:36:16,281 --> 01:36:18,860
and I thought of myself.
I was trying to watch that movie saying,

2079
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:22,130
if I saw this movie without having known
about the first movie,

2080
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,500
what would I think about it?
Especially because I'm taking my kids.

2081
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:26,240
Right?
It's a good movie to take kids to.

2082
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,380
It's fun.
Silly.

2083
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:28,550
It's kind of scary,
like whoa,

2084
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:32,240
but it's obviously really fake,
but it's.

2085
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:37,270
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't a point where anybody would 

2086
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:39,701
get mad.
The only reason why anybody got mad is 

2087
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:42,671
because it's a redo of the original 
ghostbusters and it's all women instead 

2088
01:36:42,671 --> 01:36:44,750
of all men.
Everybody got fucking terrified or angry

2089
01:36:44,751 --> 01:36:48,650
or frustrated or pissed or who's fucking
social justice warriors.

2090
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:54,190
My thought is who gives a fuck?
Like is that really a concern that 

2091
01:36:55,431 --> 01:36:59,060
they've decided to try to make money by 
reducing ghostbusters with chicks?

2092
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:01,060
Like isn't that an obvious thing?
I thought,

2093
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:06,120
I thought.
I think the biggest concern for me 

2094
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:06,120
lately with movies is the stories aren't
there.

2095
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:09,941
We're just looking at so much cgi and 
tricks that they need to really think 

2096
01:37:09,941 --> 01:37:09,941
about like,
holy shit,

2097
01:37:09,941 --> 01:37:12,590
what the fuck was the plot of this 
movie?

2098
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:13,850
Will that was ghostbusters?

2099
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:14,930
Yeah,
definitely.

2100
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:20,170
There was definitely part of that.
There was also some really clunky 

2101
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:20,170
writing there.
Something like that,

2102
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:22,280
like with the point where yoU saw them 
in some scenes early on.

2103
01:37:22,281 --> 01:37:26,420
They're really fun and unexpected and 
light fun kind of scenes like,

2104
01:37:26,421 --> 01:37:28,700
this is kind of fun.
This movie's kind of fucking weird.

2105
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:31,700
It's like it's not a bad movie,
and then you're like,

2106
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,020
oh,
but it's kinda bad.

2107
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:34,520
Here we.
This part's kind of bad.

2108
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:36,080
It's all like a bunch of different 
movies.

2109
01:37:36,081 --> 01:37:40,790
It's not like if you go back and watch 
like a pick a classic movie,

2110
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:42,740
like if you go Watch the outlaw josey 
wales,

2111
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:48,160
the outlaw josey wales is the outlaw 
josey wales froM minute one to the time 

2112
01:37:48,711 --> 01:37:51,650
of the end of the movie.
It doesn't vary in the way it feels.

2113
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:55,920
It feels like the outlaw josey wales.
It's a beautiful work of art.

2114
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:01,370
It's seamless iN its production,
like the way it portrays everything is 

2115
01:38:02,071 --> 01:38:07,071
the same through the whole movie and it 
builds up and it makes you feel like 

2116
01:38:07,071 --> 01:38:07,320
you're really engrossed in,
gripped in it.

2117
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:12,830
ThiS movie didn't do that.
This ghostbusters movie would take you 

2118
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:13,140
in and pull you away and take you to 
push you away from it.

2119
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:15,170
It was like,
it would be so clunky at tiMes.

2120
01:38:15,171 --> 01:38:15,960
You'd be like,
what?

2121
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,870
Like this is the same movie that did 
that youtube thing earlier.

2122
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:20,790
That was so hilarious.
Is the same movie.

2123
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,700
How did,
how did,

2124
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:24,190
how did this get through?
Did you guys just who,

2125
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:26,280
who gave you?
Did you guys get shitty notes?

2126
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:31,310
Like what happened?
I want to know what happened cause like 

2127
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:34,820
if that goes buster Movie came out and 
it was all checks but it was fucking 

2128
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:39,030
bang and just hold clarius like what is 
that movie that all the girls love that?

2129
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:39,570
I haven't seen it.

2130
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:43,020
The hilarious bridesmaids and something 
bad.

2131
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,400
Bad mom.
No,

2132
01:38:44,401 --> 01:38:46,300
that's a new one.
There's an old one.

2133
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:49,590
Something bridesmaids that kristen wiggs
in it too.

2134
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:54,650
Yes.
That movie's supposed to be fucking 

2135
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:54,650
hilarious.
I have not seen it,

2136
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:59,120
but like a lot of people that have seen 
it that I respect as comedians have 

2137
01:38:59,120 --> 01:38:59,370
said,
do that movie is fucking hilarious.

2138
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,550
I think berman is god.
I might just put words in his mouth.

2139
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,580
Maybe it was joy.
Did you see this?

2140
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:06,520
The neW independence?
Of course not.

2141
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:07,700
Fuck that.
Of course not.

2142
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:09,990
How long does that last awful.
When I saw.

2143
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:11,550
How long did that last?
The movie theater.

2144
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:13,080
Oh,
a day at least.

2145
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:14,950
I mean it has to last at least a week or
two

2146
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:19,850
spoken independence day enough.
Capital e,

2147
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:21,890
dash nef.

2148
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:28,420
It's weird because I buy movies on 
itunes now.

2149
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:33,700
You know,
like I instead of like when it's not on 

2150
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:35,650
netflix and hulu,
I'd rather spend 10 bucks and buy it on 

2151
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:37,090
itunes,
then go to a movie and spend 50,

2152
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:38,120
you know,
on everything.

2153
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:41,540
So I buy a lot of movies now in so many 
movies that I'm like,

2154
01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:43,280
I've heard nothing but good things about
this.

2155
01:39:43,281 --> 01:39:44,150
Maybe I'm like,
god damn,

2156
01:39:44,151 --> 01:39:46,480
I wasted 10 buCks on that fucking like 
what?

2157
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:50,570
Give me an example.
Oh fuck you like 10 cloverfield lane.

2158
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:51,440
No,
I haven't seen that,

2159
01:39:51,441 --> 01:39:52,550
but I,
that's one of the ones.

2160
01:39:52,551 --> 01:39:57,551
I'm not a problem.
I'll be about to endorse it and 

2161
01:39:57,551 --> 01:39:58,400
recommend it to you,
but I hate it.

2162
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,760
some people hated it.
Did you sit iN the theater?

2163
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:03,170
No.
So at home,

2164
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:06,590
do you like seeing movies in the theater
or action movies specifically?

2165
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,530
Do you think that's important to see 
them there versus at home?

2166
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:14,620
Unless your p digitally.
I mean like when you got some gigantic 

2167
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:15,330
ass fucking house with a movie theater 
and it,

2168
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:18,200
you're not going to get the same effect 
of the sound.

2169
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,430
I think the when when someone is a 
composer,

2170
01:40:21,490 --> 01:40:26,490
like let's take for example,
like certain movies that have amazing 

2171
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:29,350
soundtracks and like you hear things 
happening behind you.

2172
01:40:29,351 --> 01:40:33,400
Like The most recent star wars movie 
soundtrack was incredible and like this,

2173
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,120
all these,
there's all this shit going on.

2174
01:40:39,121 --> 01:40:44,121
It's part of the experience.
You'll wash this giant ass fucking 

2175
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:44,121
screen.
It'S beautiful.

2176
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:46,020
Crystal clear.
The sound is incredible.

2177
01:40:46,021 --> 01:40:48,120
Literally feels like it's coming from 
everywhere in the room.

2178
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:51,780
You can't reproduce that at home.
so in that case,

2179
01:40:51,781 --> 01:40:54,010
I think that yeah,
for some kinds

2180
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,680
of movies watching it in a movie theater
is.

2181
01:40:56,681 --> 01:41:01,681
But how about a country with no country,
no country for old men that's totally 

2182
01:41:02,801 --> 01:41:03,190
unnecessary.

2183
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,430
Watch that movie in the movie theater,
we don't need to require that.

2184
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:10,620
That's.
It's not a big sound movie though to 

2185
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:10,620
sound is required and whatnot.
But like it's not.

2186
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,030
There's no big sound elements in it.
Right?

2187
01:41:12,031 --> 01:41:12,200
It's awesome.

2188
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:15,580
Some movie that might be better if you 
absorb it by yourself,

2189
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:20,760
you don't want to be influenced by 
anybody because it's such a movie that 

2190
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:20,860
makes you think so much.
Like even the end of it,

2191
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:22,960
the individual sort of a,
I don't want to give it away,

2192
01:41:22,961 --> 01:41:27,961
but it's a very strange ending,
but it's one of the best movies I've 

2193
01:41:27,961 --> 01:41:31,381
ever seen.
But it's one of those movies where as 

2194
01:41:31,381 --> 01:41:31,381
you're watching it,
you're like in gripped,

2195
01:41:31,381 --> 01:41:31,870
you're just,
it's,

2196
01:41:31,950 --> 01:41:36,950
it takes you to this place and you don't
want to be distracted in any way when 

2197
01:41:37,061 --> 01:41:42,061
you're dealing with this.
Like it's not doing anything you 

2198
01:41:42,061 --> 01:41:42,910
expected to do.
It's doing all sorts of weird shit.

2199
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,580
Like it's a,
it's very different than a lot of movies

2200
01:41:45,581 --> 01:41:50,581
and a lot of movies that have this very 
specific formula that even if they get 

2201
01:41:50,581 --> 01:41:54,061
creative inside that formula,
they still stick to the formula and the 

2202
01:41:54,061 --> 01:41:54,430
good guy wins in the end and all that 
stuff happened.

2203
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:56,710
This movie is not like that at all.
None.

2204
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:01,920
No country for old men took me like a 
couple of years to really appreciate 

2205
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,160
what it was all about because I saw it.
I was like,

2206
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:04,600
god,
they acting is so good.

2207
01:42:04,601 --> 01:42:06,220
The story so compelling.
But what is,

2208
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:07,810
what is missing in this thing?
Well,

2209
01:42:07,811 --> 01:42:09,310
it's missing this.
It's not tidy.

2210
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:13,300
It's like this just spectacular work of 
drama.

2211
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:18,720
So much shit going on.
It just leaves you with this feeling of 

2212
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:19,630
whoa at the end of it,
you know?

2213
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,580
And I think that,
you know,

2214
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:24,340
movies like that,
that's a,

2215
01:42:24,341 --> 01:42:26,950
that's a rare accomplishment to like 
they.

2216
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:32,010
I mean it's,
it's sort of like what we're talking 

2217
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:32,010
about,
Michael Phelps being so incredible.

2218
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:34,380
It's something that everybody could do.
Like it's,

2219
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:39,820
there's,
there's all kinds of movies that are 

2220
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,911
awesome,
and then every now and then you get a 

2221
01:42:41,911 --> 01:42:41,911
movie that makes you go,
whoa,

2222
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,220
I got complete.
redefiner are

2223
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,450
super rare,
but when it happens,

2224
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:49,780
when you hear that,
the last five that aren't that like,

2225
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:56,180
here's the last five I bought,
that sucked and everyone told me it was 

2226
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,880
an amazing movie inside out,
which is a pixar movie.

2227
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:59,190
Loved it.
Wow.

2228
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:04,670
Dora kidS loved it.
I read stories to them every night and 

2229
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:04,670
modulated.
Gosh,

2230
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:05,780
you liked it.
So you liked that.

2231
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:09,090
Shut down my body's testosterone 
adapters.

2232
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:12,700
And I sit in this seat as a daddy and 
shit.

2233
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,900
I live my life through a.
How dare you,

2234
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:20,680
how dare you mock him while he cries in 
albuquerque.

2235
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:22,140
Um,
and uh,

2236
01:43:22,141 --> 01:43:23,040
while,
uh,

2237
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:24,750
you know,
enjoy it from their eyes.

2238
01:43:24,751 --> 01:43:26,420
They enjoy it.
They think it's a legacy.

2239
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,560
I hang out with a six year old that you 
love dearly child that you know,

2240
01:43:31,561 --> 01:43:33,780
for kids.
I agree 100 percent definitely.

2241
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,390
But if it was by myself and go,
shut the stupid fucking shit off.

2242
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:37,200
Yeah,
the worst I like,

2243
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:39,400
I have a theory that if you're on for 
you,

2244
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:42,160
if you're on depression medicine,
it's like the best movie ever,

2245
01:43:42,161 --> 01:43:47,161
and I've heard people saying,
I've cried five times in that movie as 

2246
01:43:47,161 --> 01:43:47,161
the kid.
You might cry.

2247
01:43:47,161 --> 01:43:47,290
Yeah.
Uh,

2248
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,220
another one in a million ways to die in 
the west west.

2249
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:52,040
One of the worst piles of shit

2250
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:57,040
I've ever seen in my life.
Set mcfarland's movie where he's in the 

2251
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:00,971
west and a seth macfarlane family guy.
He made a movie.

2252
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:02,570
Yeah.
Is he the actor?

2253
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:06,230
Everyone told me that was great and I 
fucking hated it.

2254
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:09,050
Oh,
I know they're setting the toP 10 posts.

2255
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:11,450
Either it could wreck your brain and 
start thinking,

2256
01:44:11,451 --> 01:44:12,710
man,
fuck cartoons.

2257
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:14,780
I'm ready to sling this dick in front of
the camera.

2258
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,580
Says he's too smart.
He's too much of a bad motherfucker.

2259
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:29,210
Seth macfarlane number and his ass the 
night before,

2260
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:30,380
the night before.
What's that?

2261
01:44:30,381 --> 01:44:32,330
Everyone told me that was a great movie.
I haven't heard of that.

2262
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,980
It's a seth macfarlane.
Maybe that I forgot.

2263
01:44:33,981 --> 01:44:35,600
I bought that.
It was really horrible,

2264
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:36,510
but that's the main.

2265
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:37,170
Yeah,

2266
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:41,020
girl,
she's hot.

2267
01:44:41,110 --> 01:44:42,070
Charlie's,
they're wrong.

2268
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:47,220
No,
that's not a the wrong what's going on 

2269
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,531
with her face.
That's not real photoshop poster a 

2270
01:44:49,531 --> 01:44:49,810
little bit.
So why would they do that?

2271
01:44:49,811 --> 01:44:51,640
You take one of the most beautiful women
in the world

2272
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:55,560
and you alter her to make her look like 
some modern day playmate.

2273
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,330
That's so stupid.
That wasn't eric.

2274
01:44:58,470 --> 01:44:59,960
That's deciphered.
Oh,

2275
01:44:59,961 --> 01:45:00,890
okay.
Well there you go,

2276
01:45:00,891 --> 01:45:02,660
bitch.
Take that back.

2277
01:45:02,661 --> 01:45:03,310
There she goes,
charlene.

2278
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,710
Yeah.
Come on man.

2279
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:10,260
That can't really be at 33 percent 
rotten tomatoes.

2280
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:15,350
Somewhat dated payday payday bills.
Why tomatoes needs that paper,

2281
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:21,930
ted to speak.
If you want more than 33.

2282
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:23,340
well,
you know,

2283
01:45:23,341 --> 01:45:25,160
we thought we could have business 
swatch.

2284
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,870
We'll have a trach rotten tomatoes.

2285
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:32,660
Turn into a gangster from new jack city 
titties.

2286
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:36,020
Have a meeTing,
a business meeting.

2287
01:45:36,021 --> 01:45:41,021
I put it on my platinum card.
Now you'd have a black card if you're a 

2288
01:45:41,021 --> 01:45:41,021
real ball.
You okay?

2289
01:45:41,021 --> 01:45:42,090
Black card?
Yeah,

2290
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:47,960
but she had a black card.
I think it'd be cool if When my sister 

2291
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:51,010
comes over and her fucking husband 
starts bragging about his business,

2292
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:55,170
he pull all your black card.
Bb back card.

2293
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:58,310
You know,
it's a good maybe for kids,

2294
01:45:58,311 --> 01:46:02,710
so I think it's one of my favorite 
animated ones are not the zootopia.

2295
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,620
I think he's like,
I'm seth motherfucking macfarlane.

2296
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:07,770
I don't need a goddamn black card.
Okay.

2297
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,120
Are you like a regular car?
It's ironic.

2298
01:46:10,121 --> 01:46:15,121
I have a flip flip phone.
I drive a mini cooper seth macfarlane.

2299
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:20,690
I made the valet guy.
You bet that.

2300
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:24,970
How much success is that guy?
He's great.

2301
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:26,830
I like him.
He is an awesome.

2302
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,490
I met him.
He's a super busy high times of words.

2303
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:33,130
I've met him twice.
That was a,

2304
01:46:33,131 --> 01:46:34,600
I don't know.
I don't think we met him then.

2305
01:46:34,601 --> 01:46:35,230
Dude.
Yeah,

2306
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:36,760
I think we met.
Um,

2307
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,840
seth rogen.
do you?

2308
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:40,930
You're with seth rogen?
Yeah.

2309
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:43,930
I met seth mcfarland at his place 
because I did a voice,

2310
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,470
like a fear factor voice on one of the 
shows.

2311
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:48,070
I wasn't american dad,
I think.

2312
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,190
Yes.
But he's a super

2313
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,990
nice guy.
Super nice guy.

2314
01:46:51,991 --> 01:46:52,790
He's like,
he,

2315
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,300
he's laughing.
He goes,

2316
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:56,310
we just smoked pot and come up with 
funny shit.

2317
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:59,550
If that was his,
like he was like super easy to get along

2318
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:00,900
with,
like really friendly.

2319
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:02,910
I did the thing for them.
I said,

2320
01:47:02,911 --> 01:47:03,990
thanks man,
I'm really nice to meet you.

2321
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:06,780
Like super friendly and nice,
and I was like,

2322
01:47:06,781 --> 01:47:08,820
wow,
that's cool to you know,

2323
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,160
a lot of times you meet these super 
genius characters.

2324
01:47:11,161 --> 01:47:15,690
They're awkward and yellow.
Don't make this guy annoyed,

2325
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:16,600
you know,
here's what I'm.

2326
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:18,720
Some super genius guy that created some 
sitcom,

2327
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:20,010
try to be nice to them.
I don't know,

2328
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:25,250
you don't know what you're dealing with.
But like so far I've met a lot of those 

2329
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:28,701
guys that some of them work on like paul
centers and one of the first guy that 

2330
01:47:28,701 --> 01:47:33,670
ever,
like there was a guy produced news 

2331
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:35,621
radio,
the first guy to give me like my big 

2332
01:47:35,621 --> 01:47:35,621
break in hollywood.

2333
01:47:35,621 --> 01:47:38,450
He when I met the first time I met him.
Like this guy is like way too smart and 

2334
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:42,550
way too weird.
Like I don't want to piss him off 

2335
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:42,550
because I want this job.
Like I don't even know what to say.

2336
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:42,930
This dude,
you know,

2337
01:47:42,931 --> 01:47:46,860
there's a certain like super genius type
characters like show runner type dudes.

2338
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:50,520
They're notoriously like powerful 
figures.

2339
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,960
Like who's that guy that like charlie 
sheen got into it with that was a sitcom

2340
01:47:54,961 --> 01:47:56,700
creator.
What does that dude's name?

2341
01:47:56,730 --> 01:47:57,810
Chuck lorre.
Yes.

2342
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:02,840
That guy is the mac daddy of those shows
like no one has run more of those 

2343
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:06,740
fucking gigantic smash.
Super $100,

2344
01:48:06,741 --> 01:48:10,290
million billion dollar hits.
Then that guy who sounds lIke a handsome

2345
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:11,090
person.
Well,

2346
01:48:11,091 --> 01:48:16,091
he's just a.
He just knows how to do those kind of 

2347
01:48:16,091 --> 01:48:16,091
shows.
You know,

2348
01:48:16,091 --> 01:48:16,770
like he's a guy who's figured out like a
frequency.

2349
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,680
He's figured out.

2350
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:21,600
He's gotten more shit.
Really?

2351
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:23,420
Yeah.
two and a half men and greg.

2352
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:27,450
Civil grace under fire.
Big bang theory mom for an eastern.

2353
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,660
What?
The fucks for anything since 1992.

2354
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:35,710
What he was learning,
he was learning grace unDer fire was a 

2355
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:37,290
big one.
There was a crazy rumor that I.

2356
01:48:37,291 --> 01:48:42,291
I can't really talk about too much about
brett butler from grace under fire at 

2357
01:48:42,291 --> 01:48:44,130
the cool guy in the top left.
What's his face telling nigger on?

2358
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:45,120
He died recently.
Oh,

2359
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:45,820
did,
that's right.

2360
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:51,590
He was a super nice guy telling 
negroland came up to me after one of my 

2361
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:53,270
sets one night and was like,
uh,

2362
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:55,590
like one of the,
one of the nicest compliments,

2363
01:48:55,591 --> 01:49:00,591
but also like really honest and,
and curious.

2364
01:49:00,601 --> 01:49:02,370
Like we had like a reallY cool 
conversation.

2365
01:49:02,371 --> 01:49:05,340
I was like,
this is the least hollywood conversation

2366
01:49:05,341 --> 01:49:09,420
between two men that do the same 
business in hollywood ever.

2367
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:12,330
He was like super honest about like 
subject matter.

2368
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,370
We were talking about like,
um,

2369
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,440
um,
like he,

2370
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:22,020
he said that he's always wondered like 
what should we talk about on stage?

2371
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:24,510
And he's sometimes he's confined 
himself.

2372
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:30,170
He was saying that he wondered or 
worried whether or not the audience 

2373
01:49:30,170 --> 01:49:33,501
would appreciate his own.
The things that he thought were 

2374
01:49:33,501 --> 01:49:36,650
interesting.
So instead he was writing and talking 

2375
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:39,891
about stuff that he thought that they 
would think would be interesting and 

2376
01:49:39,891 --> 01:49:43,431
that he was trying to change that.
So we had this really interesting talk 

2377
01:49:43,431 --> 01:49:46,011
about it,
but he died really suddenly have like a 

2378
01:49:46,011 --> 01:49:47,010
weird disease I think.
What age,

2379
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:50,290
age,
not that old man to look up.

2380
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:55,180
Taylor negron liver cancer.
He'd passed away january of last year.

2381
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:57,610
How old was he?
FIfty seven.

2382
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:02,900
If I can hang in there 10 years.
We got that 10 years from now to 10 

2383
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:03,190
years is quick.

2384
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:08,590
Summer fucking came and went so fast and
it's not even over yet.

2385
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:10,990
What the fuck happened?
This summer was august 11.

2386
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:16,200
It's fucking flying.
I refuse to believe that time is the 

2387
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:20,701
same every day.
I refuse to believe I don't give a fuck 

2388
01:50:20,701 --> 01:50:24,391
about your watches.
I don't care about your quartz 

2389
01:50:24,391 --> 01:50:24,391
movements.
I don't care about your atomic clock.

2390
01:50:24,391 --> 01:50:28,360
I think it's moving faster.
I agree.

2391
01:50:28,361 --> 01:50:31,900
One hundred percent.
I would have bet anything on it.

2392
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:35,800
It makes zero sense.
let's all bet.

2393
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:37,240
$5.
Okay.

2394
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:38,980
Since you said he'd bet everything on 
it.

2395
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:41,910
I'm putting you money on the table,
fella.

2396
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,200
All right,
let's go to the carpet.

2397
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,130
Tell us the answer.
Jamie.

2398
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:47,700
Times moving faster.
One of the things that I was.

2399
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:53,100
I was watching this thing on on planets 
and about the expansion of the universe 

2400
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:55,780
and not only the expansion,
but the fact that it's accelerating.

2401
01:50:56,050 --> 01:51:01,050
It's moving apart faster and faster and 
that they dIdn't know this 20 years ago 

2402
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:05,490
and I was listening to this guy speak 
about it and I remember thinking to 

2403
01:51:05,490 --> 01:51:06,130
myself like,
that is so crazy,

2404
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:11,131
like that is a huge factor in our 
existence that this universe is not just

2405
01:51:11,681 --> 01:51:16,681
static but it's moving away and it's 
accelerating in some sort of strange way

2406
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:22,630
and that they can measure it when they 
measure it over 10 or 20 years is a 

2407
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:24,880
measurable number that allows them to 
discern like,

2408
01:51:24,881 --> 01:51:29,881
okay,
we were positive that this thing is not 

2409
01:51:29,881 --> 01:51:33,211
just moving but accelerating and this is
our universe and they just figured that 

2410
01:51:33,211 --> 01:51:33,280
out 20 years ago.

2411
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:38,530
like we're just waking up.
It's like we're on a starship and we're 

2412
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:39,040
flying through the university.
We just came out of hyperspace and we're

2413
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:40,270
all like,
okay,

2414
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:41,950
where are we going?
What is,

2415
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:43,210
what's,
what is this?

2416
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:45,130
Okay?
Does anybody have a manual?

2417
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:50,360
Here's the manual.
We're going to go look through the shit 

2418
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:51,190
that the old people wrote down.
We literally are exactly the same thing.

2419
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:56,520
Like we get taught by people who get 
taught by people who get taught by 

2420
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:57,430
people who are basically monkeys,
you know,

2421
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:02,550
it was like,
this is like a few chains away from us 

2422
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:02,680
and dudes with sticks trying to kill 
giraffes and shit.

2423
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:06,610
There's not that many.
If you Go back in time like numbers,

2424
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:11,850
you wouldn't get Like 20,
30 times and then you're in the caveman 

2425
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:12,460
era.
That shit is not that far ago,

2426
01:52:12,461 --> 01:52:15,040
man.
It's not that far ago.

2427
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,730
So we're like waking up in the middle of
like this trip,

2428
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:27,040
this whole galaxy hurling through the 
universe going a thousand miles an hour 

2429
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:30,790
and a circle flying around a huge 
nuclear explosion a million times bigger

2430
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:35,791
than it just flying through the universe
and we're waking up and we're going,

2431
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,810
what about gay marriage?
Fuck that.

2432
01:52:37,811 --> 01:52:38,860
Not on my watch,
bro.

2433
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:39,760
Okay,
okay.

2434
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:41,080
Okay.
What do you think about taxes?

2435
01:52:41,170 --> 01:52:46,170
WeLl,
we need to revamp the entire tax rates 

2436
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:46,170
and we did russell's book and you'll get
to where your powdered wig and

2437
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:51,190
meanwhile flying through infinity and we
just realizing it.

2438
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,490
We're just like,
oh,

2439
01:52:52,491 --> 01:52:57,491
we're not.
Not only is the son not the center of 

2440
01:52:57,491 --> 01:53:01,511
the universe,
not only is the earth not the center of 

2441
01:53:01,511 --> 01:53:03,251
the universe,
but this galaxy is just one of hundreds 

2442
01:53:03,251 --> 01:53:03,770
of billions.
There's untold numbers.

2443
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:06,670
Not only that,
but inside each galaxy is a supermassive

2444
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:11,680
black hole that's one half of one 
percent of the mass of the entire 

2445
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:11,680
galaxy,
and if you go through that,

2446
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,910
there might be an unlimited number of 
universes.

2447
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:20,580
How the planetS are lined up.
Right now we're getting some sweet 

2448
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:20,580
pitchers from mars.
Have you seen those?

2449
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:20,870
Dude,
that one.

2450
01:53:20,910 --> 01:53:25,310
What else I've seen mad about you,
chuck lorre knocking it out of the park,

2451
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:26,510
making,
making cash.

2452
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:32,020
He's got a tube right at Thailand,
has a tube and he presses a green light 

2453
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:36,490
and the hotness,
young prostitute you've ever seen in 

2454
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:36,490
your life goes through that.

2455
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:40,880
This is not true.
That's totally sheen.

2456
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:42,750
I got confused.
Charlie sheen would do that.

2457
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:45,290
Charlie sheen probably did.
That was two and a half men money.

2458
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:47,180
He's almost out of money.
Supposedly.

2459
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:50,240
He's almost spent the last amount of 
money.

2460
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:51,760
That's not true.
I heard it.

2461
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:54,130
I Just read that he's like really 
hurting,

2462
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:56,390
like he's cutting this money up from his
ex wife.

2463
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:58,560
Like he used to give her so much money 
around.

2464
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:00,470
Cut it all off.
Oh no.

2465
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:02,940
I mean,
well he is a,

2466
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:07,990
he's got hiv and he does a lot of drugs.
Those are not good things to have 

2467
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:11,951
together.
I mean like everybody was on his side 

2468
01:54:11,951 --> 01:54:15,880
when that whole thing went down with 
that chuck lorre guy that chuck lorre 

2469
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:16,310
guys like this.
He's a real simple man.

2470
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,980
Money iS tight.
I can't pay ridiculous child support.

2471
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:23,090
Well,
that might be a tmz headline by the way.

2472
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,420
Fifty $5,000
a month.

2473
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:28,220
Wow.
Wonderful.

2474
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:33,580
Charlie had been raking in six,
13 a month just from his cut of two and 

2475
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:34,790
a half men profits.
Wow.

2476
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:36,650
Six hundred.
$13,000

2477
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:38,570
a month.
Gotcha much.

2478
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:42,740
I recently had a sell those rights for a
lump sum of 26 million.

2479
01:54:42,741 --> 01:54:46,700
Seven hundred $50,000.
He is suffering.

2480
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:52,000
That is a smile pittance for a man of 
his esteem to live off.

2481
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:54,560
First of all,
how dare they,

2482
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,800
how dare they only give him $26 million.
He doesn'T say what happened to the 

2483
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:04,631
stash.
Charlie says he now averages $87,000

2484
01:55:04,911 --> 01:55:09,911
a month and last month got a relatively 
paltry $6,261.

2485
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:16,060
He says he now can't keep up because his
monthly expenses total $105,000

2486
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:21,970
and $25,000
for healthcare expenses not covered by 

2487
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:22,970
any insurance.
Twenty $5,000

2488
01:55:22,971 --> 01:55:27,971
a month for healthcare expenses.
Is that what you call your drug dealer?

2489
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:29,690
Oh,
allegedly.

2490
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:34,960
Allegedly.
Maybe he's just got a fucking Michael 

2491
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:34,960
Jackson type dude.

2492
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:39,130
Put them to sleep at night.
Just every lease amount by Michael 

2493
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:39,130
Jackson.
Dude,

2494
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:39,620
that dude slipped.
I ain't going to slip baby.

2495
01:55:39,621 --> 01:55:41,230
I got your back on my hold.
You.

2496
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:44,460
I'm going to be with you.
I'm going to put you under every night.

2497
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,230
Different shit.
I got different shit.

2498
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:48,320
The shit did michael jackson's doctorate
use.

2499
01:55:48,370 --> 01:55:49,740
It was a good idea.
In theory.

2500
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:54,800
Here's why it doesn't work in practice.
It doesn't allow you to go to heavy rem 

2501
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:54,800
sleep.
My stuff does.

2502
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:59,330
Okay.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to 

2503
01:55:59,330 --> 01:56:00,380
take you to the.
I'm going to drop you out of the alpha 

2504
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:00,380
spate into beta state and then you go 
and you're like,

2505
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:00,570
okay.
Okay.

2506
01:56:00,571 --> 01:56:01,080
Okay,
cool.

2507
01:56:01,081 --> 01:56:01,770
Cool.
I'm charlie cina.

2508
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,940
Look,
I'd love to talk to you,

2509
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:04,750
But there's a fucking,
uh,

2510
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:08,390
a bowling ball bag filled with coke and 
five strippers and the other room I kind

2511
01:56:08,391 --> 01:56:08,910
of go to work.

2512
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:14,300
If you could guess a nuMber,
how many people do you think are being 

2513
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:14,300
put to sleep?
Not daily,

2514
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:17,090
but like semi daily or we did that way 
to,

2515
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,380
to two a day.
RIght?

2516
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:24,990
Like thousands of people.
100 people need heavy sedation by maybe 

2517
01:56:25,681 --> 01:56:26,550
a dog.
There's a lot.

2518
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:31,790
There's a lot.
I know several people that are really 

2519
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:31,790
nice,
folks that need adderall,

2520
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:34,050
not adderall.
Ambien to go to bed meet you.

2521
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:38,880
They're not drug addicts.
They work jobs that are very stressful.

2522
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:42,360
they have a very nice families.
there's nothing wrong with them.

2523
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:44,100
Do you notice they love that stuff?
Do you know?

2524
01:56:44,101 --> 01:56:46,380
It's mostly women though.
I find that,

2525
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:47,640
yeah.
really?

2526
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:51,060
I know it seems like every girl I know 
either is taking over the counter,

2527
01:56:51,061 --> 01:56:56,061
like what's the stuff that's in a good 
on it stuff?

2528
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:57,960
New mood.
Five htp.

2529
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,530
Yeah.
No,

2530
01:56:58,570 --> 01:57:01,170
no.
The one that makes a trip trip to law or

2531
01:57:01,171 --> 01:57:02,790
they're taking,
they're supposed to make you relax.

2532
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:04,680
Uh,
but everyone,

2533
01:57:04,681 --> 01:57:07,420
every girl I know it has something to 
help her sleep almost,

2534
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:10,140
you know,
consider what you just said.

2535
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:13,700
first of all,
I know those are hanging around and slip

2536
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:18,080
this on grazing and it a bad.
Anybody be crazy.

2537
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:23,120
We need everybody.
It's like that song it takes to put 

2538
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,960
sleeping issues just seems really big.
Yeah.

2539
01:57:25,961 --> 01:57:29,100
But you're dealing with a very biased 
study group.

2540
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:29,940
Oh yeah.
I know.

2541
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:32,490
Yeah.
Some people sleep like babies bro.

2542
01:57:32,491 --> 01:57:34,110
They can't wait to sleep,
but no guys.

2543
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:34,830
Alright.
Yeah.

2544
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:36,820
I don't take,
I've never taken a sleeping pill.

2545
01:57:36,821 --> 01:57:37,970
I know guys.
Yeah.

2546
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:40,860
It's weird when you don't have like 
regular life job.

2547
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:41,460
Yeah,
true.

2548
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:44,400
And I just pretty much go to sleep when 
I go to sleep now.

2549
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:49,440
Yeah.
I know guys with a lot of serious 

2550
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,210
obligations that oftentimes will work 10
to 12 hours a day all the time.

2551
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:52,980
Like I have a good buddy of mine,
he needs it.

2552
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:54,700
He works 10,
12 hours a day.

2553
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:59,710
He has hIs own business and he's always 
working and he's fucking exhausted and 

2554
01:57:59,710 --> 01:58:01,060
sometimes he's like,
ah,

2555
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:02,940
what about the accounts and what about 
this and that,

2556
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:08,320
and he'll take an ambient and pop off 
and I feel like now all I have to do is 

2557
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:12,471
just eat and I'll fall asleep for like,
I don't know what it means.

2558
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:17,360
Like last night I had chicken wings and 
I fell asleep like men child.

2559
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:21,380
Do you know about their child's brian?
No.

2560
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:26,390
I mean it's like I don't understand 
these people like I guess we have jobs 

2561
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:28,290
and they don't sleep.
Whatever funnel I could sleep,

2562
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:31,380
I don't get it.
Food does not gIve me energy.

2563
01:58:31,381 --> 01:58:33,630
It just makes me sleepy.
Well,

2564
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:36,330
it does,
but It also robs you of resources.

2565
01:58:36,331 --> 01:58:41,331
It's really not a good idea to eat a lot
of food before you go to bed because a 

2566
01:58:41,331 --> 01:58:42,010
lot of times you bought body starts 
digesting that food

2567
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,760
and it uses up resources which you 
should go to bed.

2568
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:50,910
You shouldn't be hungry,
but there should be some time between 

2569
01:58:50,910 --> 01:58:54,291
when you eat and when you go to bed,
allow your body to them food so that 

2570
01:58:54,291 --> 01:58:57,871
your body can adequately go into the 
many stages that it requires to really 

2571
01:58:57,871 --> 01:58:58,420
rebuild your system.

2572
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:01,080
I'm going to feel like I eat now.
I'll fall asleep like I'll be like.

2573
01:59:01,290 --> 01:59:06,290
I know,
but I'm just saying like it's not the 

2574
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:06,290
smartest thing to do.

2575
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:10,620
Gets sleepy after they eat a lot,
but it's really not the right the right 

2576
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:10,620
thing to do.
the right thing to do,

2577
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:12,360
especially if you eat anything heavy 
carbs,

2578
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:14,400
bro.
Science coming up,

2579
01:59:14,401 --> 01:59:19,401
strap strap in for brown science,
allegedly the spike in insulin that you 

2580
01:59:20,821 --> 01:59:23,730
get from taking in all those.
If you like pizza,

2581
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:29,060
you have like a whole pizza to yourself.
It's like you're late night life anD 

2582
01:59:29,971 --> 01:59:33,450
we're all laughing and stoned and we all
ordered five pizzas.

2583
01:59:33,870 --> 01:59:34,620
That's not good.

2584
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:35,620
Good.
I like it.

2585
01:59:35,621 --> 01:59:38,860
Might be good for those 20 minutes while
you're eating that pizza.

2586
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:43,570
I'm saying if I have soup,
if I just have some like chicken soup.

2587
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:48,400
Lying,
wendy's double double.

2588
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:53,470
I love soup.
I do to say soup soup is one of my 

2589
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:53,590
favorite blues blueprint number,
bro.

2590
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:57,370
My.
It's great because my girlfriend is like

2591
01:59:57,371 --> 02:00:00,340
a huge cooker and so I just have to tell
her what I call the chef.

2592
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:02,080
Yeah,
but she can say cooker,

2593
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:03,670
cook or something.
You throw food in.

2594
02:00:06,730 --> 02:00:09,740
She's a crock pot,
but she's like,

2595
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,070
I got this white bean soup that my mom 
used to make.

2596
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:14,800
It was like a midwest trash type thing 
where it's like,

2597
02:00:14,801 --> 02:00:16,990
you know the one with the white beans 
and it's a little thicker.

2598
02:00:16,991 --> 02:00:20,530
Like a chilean has like bacon or ham in 
it and it's so good.

2599
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:23,620
My mom sent me her recipe and she cooked
a bunch of it,

2600
02:00:23,621 --> 02:00:26,080
but I eat almost the whole thing of 
soup.

2601
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:31,140
Yeah.
My mom used to make split pea soup with 

2602
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:31,140
ham.
God damn.

2603
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:32,270
That was good.
Split split.

2604
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:37,140
Split pea soup is not bad for you unless
you're a pig that's really bad for you.

2605
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:40,660
Either you're on the menu,
they're like split pea,

2606
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:41,740
it sounds like.
Oh,

2607
02:00:41,741 --> 02:00:44,080
what a wonderful dish.
It's organic.

2608
02:00:44,081 --> 02:00:47,290
It's vegetable based.
Not so much

2609
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:52,370
bitch.
There's actually a smoked out dead pig 

2610
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:54,240
inside of that thing in the.
You have to have the bone.

2611
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:55,560
If you do it correctly.

2612
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:58,410
He supposed to cook it with the ham hock
on the internet.

2613
02:00:58,940 --> 02:01:01,350
This piece of bacon with a nipple still 
attached to it.

2614
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,860
It's not real.
It is real.

2615
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,450
It is 100 percent real boiled pork 
belly.

2616
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:09,450
So.
Well,

2617
02:01:09,451 --> 02:01:11,300
that's what baking in.
Well,

2618
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:12,770
let me explain to you what bacon

2619
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:15,950
is because if you don't know because I 
didn't know until a couple of years ago.

2620
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:16,670
Oh,
bacon.

2621
02:01:16,671 --> 02:01:19,710
Is this part of the pig?
The bottom half a pig.

2622
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:24,770
This is one of the reasons whY bacon 
doesn't really exist on wild boars.

2623
02:01:25,790 --> 02:01:26,380
Like,
uh,

2624
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:31,130
I've only shot one wild pig and they 
don't have any bacon.

2625
02:01:31,131 --> 02:01:33,410
MaN.
They're out there hustling.

2626
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:35,210
They're a different animal.
It's,

2627
02:01:35,211 --> 02:01:36,710
it doesn't look the same either.
I mean,

2628
02:01:36,780 --> 02:01:39,110
I shot a pretty big one.
It was pretty well fed,

2629
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:40,070
but their

2630
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,760
uh,
their,

2631
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:44,450
their skin,
their flesh is not pink or white,

2632
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:45,640
like a,
you know,

2633
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:46,670
you know,
it was always pork.

2634
02:01:46,671 --> 02:01:51,671
The other white meat,
it's not supposed to be white because 

2635
02:01:51,671 --> 02:01:54,660
they're out there eating egg corns and 
ground nesting birds and all the stuff 

2636
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:54,660
that like,
they're,

2637
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:57,890
they're not herbivores either.
Those things are omnivores.

2638
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:00,050
TheY eat,
they eat fucking everything district.

2639
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:05,140
There's this picture that I tweeted a 
few months back of a boar running away 

2640
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:10,751
with a font in its mouth,
like a small deer and its mouth and a 

2641
02:02:10,751 --> 02:02:11,360
lot of people were like,
whoa.

2642
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:14,750
I did not know.
They eat babies,

2643
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:17,600
they'll eat a deer,
they fucking eat your cat.

2644
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:22,780
They'll eat your dog deli everything.
They'll you to you fuck an.

2645
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:28,050
Apparently every year someone falls into
a pen with pigs on a farm and gets 

2646
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:33,011
jacked.
Look at this pig running off with his 

2647
02:02:33,011 --> 02:02:33,011
deer and it's mal.

2648
02:02:33,011 --> 02:02:34,040
How yo,
that's dark.

2649
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:36,040
Do you see that?
Speaking of pigs in derek,

2650
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:38,420
did you see that cop shooting the deer 
video?

2651
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:40,310
Yeah,
that's fucked up man.

2652
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:42,470
I did a shot right in the head is so 
stupid.

2653
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:45,300
It's so stupid.
And he,

2654
02:02:45,301 --> 02:02:47,150
you know,
it was really callous.

2655
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:49,070
Yeah,
that was brutal.

2656
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:50,330
Well,
I think,

2657
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:52,160
yeah,
it was really callous,

2658
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:53,210
man.
It was weird.

2659
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:55,430
I guess he had to do it though.
I think that's what they said.

2660
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,510
They said,
do you have to shoot it?

2661
02:02:57,170 --> 02:03:00,980
I think he asked someone what to do and 
I think they said put it down.

2662
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:06,250
So I mean,
if you're going to put it Down the way 

2663
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:08,081
he did it,
even though it looked crazy because he 

2664
02:03:08,081 --> 02:03:08,081
did it in front of everybody with the 
way he did,

2665
02:03:08,081 --> 02:03:09,980
it was the best way to do it,
honestly.

2666
02:03:10,670 --> 02:03:12,680
Shoeing.
HeRe's the thing.

2667
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:17,810
I mean,
I don't know what they're going to do 

2668
02:03:17,810 --> 02:03:17,810
with the body.

2669
02:03:17,810 --> 02:03:19,810
I would hope,
hope they give that meet to hunters for 

2670
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:24,791
the hungry.
There is a program that's an America 

2671
02:03:24,791 --> 02:03:24,791
where hunters like say if you,
uh,

2672
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:29,990
you come over here to experience like 
the midwest of the United States,

2673
02:03:29,991 --> 02:03:32,720
like Iowa in particular,
um,

2674
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,310
um,
Kansas.

2675
02:03:34,311 --> 02:03:39,311
A lot of these areas are famous all 
across the world for having these 

2676
02:03:39,311 --> 02:03:43,720
gigantic white tail deer and it becomes 
a thing like white tail deer in the 

2677
02:03:44,991 --> 02:03:49,991
midwest of the United States.
This is something I've only found out 

2678
02:03:49,991 --> 02:03:53,081
over the last few years,
obviously of me getting interested in 

2679
02:03:53,081 --> 02:03:53,600
hunting,
but white tail deer hunting,

2680
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:57,290
like people hear about it from scotland 
and they want to come over here.

2681
02:03:57,291 --> 02:03:59,510
People hear about it from China.
They want to come over here.

2682
02:03:59,511 --> 02:04:04,200
They want to experience what it's like 
to to hunt white tail deer in Iowa.

2683
02:04:04,201 --> 02:04:09,050
It becomes like this thing and sometimes
people from other places that don't live

2684
02:04:09,051 --> 02:04:09,770
in Iowa will,
they'll,

2685
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:14,830
they'll,
they'll put in tags and they'll put in 

2686
02:04:14,830 --> 02:04:16,751
tags over and over and over and over and
over and over and over and finally they 

2687
02:04:16,751 --> 02:04:20,531
get one and they can go there and they 
can experience what it's like and then 

2688
02:04:20,531 --> 02:04:22,880
they can't bring the meat back to China 
or Australia.

2689
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:24,170
They can't,
they won't let you.

2690
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:29,350
Like if you try to fly with a dead deer 
from the United States and flying into 

2691
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:29,780
Australia,
they'd be like,

2692
02:04:29,781 --> 02:04:32,240
fuck you.
Fuck you,

2693
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:34,550
you can't take a chance and going across
the fucking ocean,

2694
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:38,070
it's really funny because if you go from
Nevada to like Ohio,

2695
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:38,790
they're like,
okay,

2696
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,670
what do you got in there?
Oh,

2697
02:04:39,671 --> 02:04:40,930
I shot A deer.
Congratulations.

2698
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:42,720
but he can't fly across water.

2699
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:45,950
We're going to cross water.

2700
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:51,440
It's very tricky.
Even if you try to bring an animal down 

2701
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:53,190
from Canada into the United States.
Well,

2702
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:55,170
I mean I'm talking about a dead animal,
you know,

2703
02:04:55,171 --> 02:04:57,360
you're trying to bring a dead animal.
It's um,

2704
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:01,680
sO it's,
it's one of those things Where it,

2705
02:05:01,681 --> 02:05:06,681
uh,
like these people donate money or do 

2706
02:05:06,681 --> 02:05:09,561
they donate food?
So if they come over here and they want 

2707
02:05:09,561 --> 02:05:09,561
experience,
if they're a hunter from Australia,

2708
02:05:09,561 --> 02:05:10,590
they want to experience what it's like 
to hunt in Iowa.

2709
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:15,890
They can donate money or In the sense of
they can donate food rather to a,

2710
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:20,520
like a lot of hungry people.
Like if you shoot a 200 pound white tail

2711
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:25,550
deer that's gonna feed,
that's going to be more than probably in

2712
02:05:26,641 --> 02:05:31,080
the neighborhood of 150 meals.
That's amazing.

2713
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:37,170
You can,
you can give that away to all these 

2714
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:37,170
people that need it.
You know,

2715
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:37,440
if you're from some other place.

2716
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:43,670
This particular.
I thought I recognize this when I saw 

2717
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:45,180
the video.
Apparently this video is from 2013.

2718
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:47,610
This is like two and a half years old.
This is not a new thing.

2719
02:05:47,611 --> 02:05:51,090
It just happened to be.
We don't care if it's three years old.

2720
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:53,340
This is old shit.
This is the one that's going around from

2721
02:05:53,341 --> 02:05:58,341
yesterday.
I saw it says also that the deer was 

2722
02:05:58,341 --> 02:06:02,211
believed to be injured and what's going 
to pretend a harm motorist if they try 

2723
02:06:02,211 --> 02:06:03,720
to shoo it away,
which is why they hit by a car.

2724
02:06:04,210 --> 02:06:05,550
It could have been hit by a car

2725
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:07,740
also.
Just could be on the way out.

2726
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,450
Yeah,
I mean that was a pretty big deer.

2727
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,200
It could be on the way out.
It could have been shot by an arrow or a

2728
02:06:13,201 --> 02:06:14,300
bullet.
You know?

2729
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:15,720
Somebody could have wounded it.

2730
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:18,980
Do you see the deer and the bear video?
What are you doing?

2731
02:06:18,981 --> 02:06:20,180
Jamie?
Quake champions.

2732
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,010
What are you trying to do?
Oh,

2733
02:06:22,730 --> 02:06:25,970
jamie tried to use subliminal messages 
on with jamie.

2734
02:06:25,971 --> 02:06:29,450
Tried to do just now what they used to 
do in the old days with the movies.

2735
02:06:29,630 --> 02:06:30,830
Hungry.
Eat popcorn.

2736
02:06:31,890 --> 02:06:32,720
Running.
Chasing this.

2737
02:06:32,721 --> 02:06:36,650
Yes.
Quake champions debut gameplay trailer.

2738
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:38,270
Okay,
let me wipe my hands.

2739
02:06:38,271 --> 02:06:43,271
Dry.
Breathe.

2740
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:48,810
Oh my god.
Look at the graphics shit.

2741
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:56,090
Oh,
so awesome.

2742
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:10,890
Holy shit.
Wow.

2743
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,010
Pure,
pure,

2744
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:41,600
pure.
That's

2745
02:07:42,510 --> 02:07:44,470
to be a super dork.
To know what fds is.

2746
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:45,080
Frames

2747
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,580
for a second.
That was an old hold

2748
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:48,530
rocket arena map did.
They were just playing on.

2749
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:51,140
That's what a dork I am.
I know that map.

2750
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:56,800
The last map.
That was an old map that we used to 

2751
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:56,800
always play on.
I don't remember the map number.

2752
02:07:57,110 --> 02:08:02,110
There was an old map.
They definitely kept the fueled and the 

2753
02:08:02,110 --> 02:08:02,110
look of the game by updated the 
graphics.

2754
02:08:02,110 --> 02:08:04,520
I really liked how they stayed true to 
the original formula.

2755
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:07,730
I hope they make it so you can't shut 
those graphics off.

2756
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:09,800
This is why.
And people get mad at me.

2757
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:12,830
Fuck bro.
Motherfucking computer doesn't have good

2758
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:17,840
firms.
The problem is you're not playing the 

2759
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:17,930
same game as a person who's seen 
everything,

2760
02:08:18,140 --> 02:08:20,090
like it's easier to play.
well,

2761
02:08:20,450 --> 02:08:25,450
I take that back.
I support your decision to mute all the 

2762
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:26,240
graphics,
but I think he kinda missing part of the

2763
02:08:26,241 --> 02:08:27,770
fun.
Like when you play,

2764
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:29,450
maybe not.
Maybe I'm full of shit.

2765
02:08:29,690 --> 02:08:32,510
Here's why I'm full of shit.
Here's why I'm definitely full of shit.

2766
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:37,990
I don't give a fuck about those.
Walgett looks cool the first time you 

2767
02:08:37,990 --> 02:08:37,990
see it.
Right?

2768
02:08:37,990 --> 02:08:39,620
But what do you really want to do?
You want to shoot that fucking dude,

2769
02:08:40,070 --> 02:08:45,070
that's what I want to do.
If I shoot him in a perfectly muted 

2770
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:46,730
environment where he's the only thing 
that I can aim at and everything else is

2771
02:08:46,731 --> 02:08:48,730
like mav.
No,

2772
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:49,850
no,
no tan.

2773
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:52,070
Like what's that?
What's a white people tan?

2774
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:57,100
Would that be if you had a crayon like 
people 10 trump or trump's not white.

2775
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:03,710
It's like an orange garfield and people 
would get super mad if you're asking for

2776
02:09:03,711 --> 02:09:06,650
a snow cone with nothing in it and they 
gave him something to color of trump.

2777
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:13,230
Like old man,
his shadow leather color shed a leather 

2778
02:09:13,230 --> 02:09:16,270
head today.
Shimmy definitely hit his head today.

2779
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:22,860
Times spin on tmz.
Too long.

2780
02:09:23,331 --> 02:09:28,331
Did it jokes folks?
No,

2781
02:09:29,450 --> 02:09:30,830
no bullying.
Relax.

2782
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:33,640
Everybody relax.
Relax.

2783
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:36,440
Don't do.
Um,

2784
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:41,560
what if you have a computer though?
That's so powerful that it doesn't 

2785
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:42,250
matter if you have the graphics on our 
night and like the textures.

2786
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:43,580
Fuck that textures,
you can do it.

2787
02:09:43,610 --> 02:09:44,660
No,
it doesn't change anything.

2788
02:09:44,690 --> 02:09:45,530
Yeah.
But here's the thing.

2789
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:47,300
It's not,
but it's not about that.

2790
02:09:47,490 --> 02:09:50,990
It used to be about some people used to 
like to run it.

2791
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:53,110
There's two things going on.
One,

2792
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:58,120
some people like to run it with the 
graphics muted because they're video 

2793
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:01,061
card can handle the frames per second.
The required to run it at like high 

2794
02:10:01,061 --> 02:10:04,361
resolution with high frame rates.
The higher frame rates make things more 

2795
02:10:04,361 --> 02:10:05,060
smooth.
So if you get,

2796
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:08,420
they say the human eye can only see 30 
frame rates a second.

2797
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:13,750
They need to update that.
I know for a fact they need to update 

2798
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:15,650
that because there's,
or at least maybe it doesn't apply,

2799
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,660
I should say,
to video games because there's something

2800
02:10:17,661 --> 02:10:22,661
that happens in video games when it goes
from 30 frames per second to 120 frames 

2801
02:10:23,091 --> 02:10:28,091
per second,
plus it becomes far smoother and when 

2802
02:10:28,091 --> 02:10:30,470
it's smoother,
there's less calculation as far as where

2803
02:10:30,471 --> 02:10:34,190
that person is at any given time because
though your mind

2804
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:37,430
can't really say,
oh,

2805
02:10:37,431 --> 02:10:42,410
I see where there's a bunch of frames 
that are rolling by and that's giving me

2806
02:10:42,411 --> 02:10:45,980
this illusion of movement and it's all 
being calculated by a cpu.

2807
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:48,830
Your brain doesn't really totally get 
that,

2808
02:10:48,831 --> 02:10:52,520
but there's some amount of data that's 
getting through when something.

2809
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:57,560
It's kind of clunky.
There's some amount of data that's 

2810
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:57,560
getting through that,
oh,

2811
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:00,641
this is not.
I just gotta figure out where that 

2812
02:11:00,641 --> 02:11:00,641
thing's going to be,
but this,

2813
02:11:00,641 --> 02:11:01,970
that thing is,
it's all like hickey.

2814
02:11:02,150 --> 02:11:06,080
It's a hiccupy thing.
When it gets to 120 frames per second,

2815
02:11:06,081 --> 02:11:08,450
it's smooth as butter.
Then it starts looking like,

2816
02:11:08,451 --> 02:11:09,500
okay,
this is a cartoon.

2817
02:11:09,740 --> 02:11:11,490
Now I'm watching a cartoon,
a cartoon,

2818
02:11:11,491 --> 02:11:12,710
and smooth,
right?

2819
02:11:12,711 --> 02:11:15,290
A cartoon doesn't have anything to herky
jerky stuff to it,

2820
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:20,500
and this is like a super smooth cartoon 
like some of the video games you play 

2821
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:21,500
like unreal tournament.

2822
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:26,500
Remember unreal Tournament,
you get into high resolutions and each 

2823
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:29,330
the screams the players and she the 
fucking laser beams shooting chunk,

2824
02:11:29,331 --> 02:11:29,980
chunk,
chunk,

2825
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:31,100
chunk.
It's crazy,

2826
02:11:31,101 --> 02:11:32,090
right?
It's crazy.

2827
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:35,570
And high frames per second.
It's very smooth.

2828
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:37,520
It's really fun and interesting to 
watch.

2829
02:11:37,521 --> 02:11:41,460
and when that happens your mind doesn't 
have to calculate as much because it,

2830
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:43,100
it's more predictable.
it's like,

2831
02:11:43,101 --> 02:11:44,720
it's smoother,
it's more,

2832
02:11:44,721 --> 02:11:46,640
uh,
it's more pleasing to the eyes,

2833
02:11:46,850 --> 02:11:51,850
but you're still dealing with all those 
textures so that you're calculating 

2834
02:11:51,850 --> 02:11:51,980
whether you like it or not or even know 
it or not.

2835
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:56,900
Every Time you pass by some gothic stone
wall and there's moss on it,

2836
02:11:56,901 --> 02:12:01,901
it's amazing looking.
your mind either has to deny the 

2837
02:12:01,901 --> 02:12:04,180
existence of that or it has to calculate
that into what it's modeled.

2838
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:05,960
The world is.
So that's extra.

2839
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:08,930
It's extra processing power.
It's unnecessary.

2840
02:12:09,110 --> 02:12:11,540
So if the walls were all like the best 
players,

2841
02:12:11,541 --> 02:12:16,541
what they would do is they would turn 
all the textures off so they would only 

2842
02:12:16,541 --> 02:12:20,210
have this like weird,
like a tron world,

2843
02:12:20,630 --> 02:12:25,630
like with tron tron blew a fuse blew and
you're in this strange virtual 

2844
02:12:25,731 --> 02:12:29,180
environment or all the walls are flat 
and matte white.

2845
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:29,490
You.

2846
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:31,700
Yeah,
it's,

2847
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:35,990
it's something that I used to have to do
just to play in that game on my own.

2848
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,340
Yeah,
my old computer.

2849
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:41,540
But I think nowadays though,
I think for the most part,

2850
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:46,570
like a game like this should probably 
run pretty perfectly on almost any 

2851
02:12:46,570 --> 02:12:48,530
computer game right here.
Has the shadows on.

2852
02:12:48,830 --> 02:12:53,830
But it has the textures off fine one 
that has the shadows off too because 

2853
02:12:55,161 --> 02:12:59,690
that happens to some crazy fuckers and 
what might not be in quake three,

2854
02:12:59,691 --> 02:13:04,691
which I think that a quick live.
But I'm in the older games guys had 

2855
02:13:05,031 --> 02:13:08,060
gotten it down to almost nothing.
There was no shadow,

2856
02:13:08,061 --> 02:13:13,061
there was no nothing.
Everything was like this weird 

2857
02:13:13,061 --> 02:13:15,710
artificial environment.
If you just started a textures off,

2858
02:13:15,711 --> 02:13:19,330
just like quick to react,
quick to um,

2859
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:23,360
shadows off and textures often quick to 
it might be a hack really.

2860
02:13:23,361 --> 02:13:28,361
It might not even necessarily be 
something that I'm now that was in the 

2861
02:13:28,361 --> 02:13:28,361
original settings.
I remember it.

2862
02:13:28,361 --> 02:13:28,370
Was it.
Yeah,

2863
02:13:28,730 --> 02:13:30,590
because it's all based on your graphics 
card.

2864
02:13:30,591 --> 02:13:32,370
A lot of graphics cards couldn't handle 
shadows

2865
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:33,570
and stuff like that.
Yeah.

2866
02:13:33,571 --> 02:13:38,571
But also in competition dudes figured 
out pretty early on that it'd be easier 

2867
02:13:38,571 --> 02:13:38,820
to hit people.
There were the only things that you were

2868
02:13:38,821 --> 02:13:40,590
looking at?
Yeah,

2869
02:13:40,591 --> 02:13:43,290
if I had to play like competitively,
I definitely shut everything off.

2870
02:13:43,330 --> 02:13:45,990
Yeah.
Because it'll make you better cheating's

2871
02:13:45,991 --> 02:13:50,991
just like cutting weight.
It's like cutting weight for video 

2872
02:13:50,991 --> 02:13:52,851
games.
Did you used to play the old unreal 

2873
02:13:52,851 --> 02:13:52,851
maps?
Like the one in the bathroom?

2874
02:13:52,851 --> 02:13:54,000
We were sitting on top of the paper 
roll.

2875
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:57,230
I played that one.
That was unreal.

2876
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:58,620
It was cool.
It was cool.

2877
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:01,770
It was like fans of quake made an 
awesome game.

2878
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:03,240
That's what it was like,
you know,

2879
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:07,290
and plug.
It was cool because didn't we get to see

2880
02:14:07,291 --> 02:14:09,270
unreal tournament before it even came 
out?

2881
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:11,550
Yeah.
We went to the studio.

2882
02:14:11,551 --> 02:14:13,170
I think it was unreal.
It was unreal.

2883
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:15,240
It was one of the unreal,
eh.

2884
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:20,390
One of the unreal releases.
I'm trying to remember which one it was 

2885
02:14:20,390 --> 02:14:22,440
the first time we met cliff.
Cliff is so normal.

2886
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,290
He's great.
I love cliff and he's.

2887
02:14:24,330 --> 02:14:29,160
He wouldn't think he'd be like some 
super genius like video game creator.

2888
02:14:29,370 --> 02:14:31,050
He seems like such a normal dude.
Yeah,

2889
02:14:31,051 --> 02:14:33,360
totally.
Do you know his game by the way,

2890
02:14:33,361 --> 02:14:37,290
if one of his games just hit itunes 
called shadow complex,

2891
02:14:37,291 --> 02:14:39,420
it's one of my favorite games,
but now you can a phone,

2892
02:14:39,421 --> 02:14:44,421
you name it.
It's a computer game you get on mac and 

2893
02:14:44,421 --> 02:14:44,421
I think you could do it on the phone 
too.

2894
02:14:44,421 --> 02:14:45,810
I just saw it the other day.
I'm not sure.

2895
02:14:45,811 --> 02:14:50,811
What is it?
It's a like a side scroller like old 

2896
02:14:50,811 --> 02:14:53,571
school kind of like where where you're 
figuring out like puzzles and playing 

2897
02:14:54,230 --> 02:14:59,230
like shooting game.
there's a game that's out that I just 

2898
02:14:59,230 --> 02:14:59,790
finished the other day.

2899
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:02,860
It's one of the best video games I've 
here.

2900
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:06,810
LIfe.
That shadow complex remastered.

2901
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:07,680
Yeah.
Oh,

2902
02:15:07,790 --> 02:15:08,600
it's this,
this cliff.

2903
02:15:08,601 --> 02:15:13,601
He's new game.
That's one of his games that came out a 

2904
02:15:13,601 --> 02:15:13,601
couple of years ago when after he left,
uh,

2905
02:15:13,601 --> 02:15:13,850
I believe,
uh,

2906
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,480
he left epic.
dude,

2907
02:15:15,481 --> 02:15:18,360
I'm so lucky I'm not a teenager today.
I'll get this.

2908
02:15:18,361 --> 02:15:20,520
Bullets are going under water.
I would never get anything done.

2909
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:25,880
I would get fucking nothing done.
I would have never gotten involved in 

2910
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:25,880
martial arts.
Maybe I would've,

2911
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:28,320
but I might not have.
I might've just done this.

2912
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:31,170
God damn.
I might've had more fun.

2913
02:15:32,710 --> 02:15:37,710
Might've been good at twitch then maybe.
It just seems so fucking compelling.

2914
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:42,420
When you watch these video games today,
they're so goddamn compelling.

2915
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:47,600
There's this new game that I just 
finished that you can get for like 20 

2916
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:47,600
bucks right now inside.
Right.

2917
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:53,540
But it's one of the best experiences of 
video game I've ever had in my life was 

2918
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:55,020
the graphics.

2919
02:15:55,050 --> 02:16:00,050
It's,
it's like a puzzle kind of games and 

2920
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:01,650
game where you try to fIgure shit out.
But the ending and the fuel of the games

2921
02:16:01,651 --> 02:16:02,010
is,
it's,

2922
02:16:02,011 --> 02:16:02,430
it's,
it's,

2923
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:06,930
it's the field of game is some of the,
probably the one of the best video games

2924
02:16:06,931 --> 02:16:10,860
I've ever experienced in my life.
And it's really hard.

2925
02:16:10,890 --> 02:16:13,770
Like there's words brian read.
There's super cool.

2926
02:16:13,771 --> 02:16:14,940
I just played it too.
Oh yeah.

2927
02:16:14,970 --> 02:16:15,720
wow.
Whoa,

2928
02:16:15,721 --> 02:16:18,030
whoa.
And it doesn't tell you how to play.

2929
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:20,400
There's no real.
It's just moving and jumping.

2930
02:16:20,401 --> 02:16:21,690
Really.
You don't really need to.

2931
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:26,840
There's no real strange controls.
But should we sell nothing off the for 

2932
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:28,890
anything?
And that's when the game.

2933
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:30,130
It's not that long to play.

2934
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,990
You can get through in a couple of hours
if you're figuring it out,

2935
02:16:31,991 --> 02:16:33,910
but it'll take you longer if you get 
stuck.

2936
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:39,030
The ending is one of the most beautiful 
pieces are our masterpieces of video 

2937
02:16:39,030 --> 02:16:40,210
game I've ever seen in my life.
Wow.

2938
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:42,040
Beautiful.
Creepy.

2939
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:42,730
Beautiful.
Yeah.

2940
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:44,860
This is cool to watch.
Yeah,

2941
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:47,470
it's really fun with shadows.
My god.

2942
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:50,200
And this isn't even that crazy of 
graphics.

2943
02:16:50,201 --> 02:16:51,340
It's,
it's just,

2944
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:52,360
it's done,
right,

2945
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:53,710
dude.
It's good feeling.

2946
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:57,350
Duncan trussell has the oculus rift and 
he also has the vive.

2947
02:16:57,430 --> 02:17:02,430
The htc vive and he showed me this 
archery game the other day and the htc 

2948
02:17:03,581 --> 02:17:05,890
vive and I don't think I can have this 
in my house.

2949
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:06,730
Yeah,
you can.

2950
02:17:06,970 --> 02:17:07,870
No,
no,

2951
02:17:07,871 --> 02:17:09,910
I don't think I can have in the studio 
here.

2952
02:17:09,970 --> 02:17:12,290
I don't think I could have it anywhere.
I would have.

2953
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:16,120
I would have a real problem.
I played that fucking archery game until

2954
02:17:16,121 --> 02:17:17,230
my arms were shaking.

2955
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:22,500
You're on the top of a castle and these 
things are like charging at nacho and 

2956
02:17:23,051 --> 02:17:24,520
shooting at them from the top of the 
castle.

2957
02:17:24,521 --> 02:17:26,610
IT's super addictive.
Yeah.

2958
02:17:26,710 --> 02:17:29,920
Did you have a game called quiver?
I just pulled this up when I was looking

2959
02:17:29,921 --> 02:17:34,921
for archery and divide.
This looks like he's got a gang of 

2960
02:17:34,921 --> 02:17:37,681
games,
but this isn't the one that I played or 

2961
02:17:37,681 --> 02:17:38,710
at least it's not the scene that I 
played a lot of games,

2962
02:17:38,711 --> 02:17:40,600
but not good games.
Like this is like,

2963
02:17:40,610 --> 02:17:43,090
like the graphics.
This looks like a nintendo 64.

2964
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:45,520
The graphics are not the best,
but seriously man,

2965
02:17:45,521 --> 02:17:48,520
you're not going to give a fuck when you
were in those goddamn htc vive.

2966
02:17:48,521 --> 02:17:51,610
Go goggles is the coolest shit in the 
world.

2967
02:17:51,850 --> 02:17:54,190
You should get together with dunkin,
go to his house,

2968
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:56,360
do his a podcast,
and,

2969
02:17:56,370 --> 02:17:58,690
and play the vive.
Before you do it,

2970
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,010
you're going to be blown away.

2971
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:01,090
I have the,
uh,

2972
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:03,850
the,
the cheap $30 one that you can buy where

2973
02:18:03,851 --> 02:18:06,400
you put your samsung phone in and they 
don't do that.

2974
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:09,040
This is the one I played.
This is the one I played.

2975
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:12,250
Yeah,
these motherfuckers just vr archery.

2976
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:13,960
You got to shoot at these,
um,

2977
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:17,260
these balloons.
It's fucking real accurate.

2978
02:18:17,261 --> 02:18:20,320
That's what's crazy.
Like you just got to get a feel of which

2979
02:18:20,321 --> 02:18:22,690
way it's going and how fast it's going.
See,

2980
02:18:22,691 --> 02:18:24,730
like it has a certain amount of frames 
per second,

2981
02:18:25,670 --> 02:18:26,450
um,
uh,

2982
02:18:26,470 --> 02:18:28,450
feet per second rather.
So the arrow,

2983
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:31,570
you have to kind of lead them,
like if you know they're jumping,

2984
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:33,940
you have to figure out where they're 
going to be.

2985
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:36,210
When the arrows get in there,
you know,

2986
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:37,630
if they're real close,
it's easy,

2987
02:18:37,631 --> 02:18:38,440
like right there,
bam.

2988
02:18:38,441 --> 02:18:39,400
It's easy.
He's right there.

2989
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:41,920
But if they're moving,
they're moving left to right.

2990
02:18:41,921 --> 02:18:44,570
You kind of get a judgment.
See how this guy is doing that.

2991
02:18:44,590 --> 02:18:46,030
He's figuring it out.
He's leading them.

2992
02:18:46,031 --> 02:18:46,960
They're moving.
Bam.

2993
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:48,850
They're running right into the arrows.
That's great.

2994
02:18:48,851 --> 02:18:53,851
That's what I figured out how to do 
after awhile and that gets super 

2995
02:18:53,851 --> 02:18:55,000
addictive because it's really rewarding 
because first of all,

2996
02:18:55,001 --> 02:18:57,010
you don't feel guilty at all because 
they're not even people.

2997
02:18:57,011 --> 02:19:02,011
They're just total cartoons.
Silhouettes With vikki helmets on and 

2998
02:19:02,011 --> 02:19:02,980
shields,
so you don't feel bad.

2999
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:04,510
What happened here?

3000
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:08,440
Is that the same thing?
Is that what happened to the later?

3001
02:19:08,441 --> 02:19:09,280
Later?
yeah.

3002
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:12,910
They give you a gun.
Hilarious.

3003
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:14,140
They're like,
you're so good.

3004
02:19:14,290 --> 02:19:16,480
You realize that it's stupid to have a 
bow and arrow here.

3005
02:19:16,481 --> 02:19:17,530
We'll give you a laser.
Oh,

3006
02:19:17,531 --> 02:19:19,980
they give you a laser radar later.
Later,

3007
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:20,730
later,
later,

3008
02:19:20,750 --> 02:19:22,480
later.
The olympics.

3009
02:19:22,481 --> 02:19:25,120
Right now we're in this for samsung 
devices.

3010
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:26,110
They're in it.
Yeah.

3011
02:19:26,111 --> 02:19:28,130
You could watch the in vr,

3012
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,110
like look around.
Oh wow.

3013
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:32,930
Did you change or did you try it?
The porn though,

3014
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:34,340
the no,
I did not.

3015
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:36,050
Porn is what was going to choose

3016
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:41,200
to.
Duncan was too insistent that I do it 

3017
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:41,200
and I got nervous.
I got the fuck out of there.

3018
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:43,220
I was Like,
you got to relax son.

3019
02:19:43,550 --> 02:19:44,780
Yeah,
make me nervous.

3020
02:19:45,020 --> 02:19:46,070
You don't want to have a gaga

3021
02:19:46,220 --> 02:19:47,490
dude.
I'm telling you.

3022
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:51,290
You got to watch the porn man.
I'll sit over here.

3023
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:56,530
You won't even see me.
He wanted to look at your lips when you 

3024
02:19:56,530 --> 02:19:59,120
were watching it.
Girl.

3025
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,240
He probably snapchat the whole thing 
while you.

3026
02:20:01,241 --> 02:20:05,510
You're playing anyways.
Did the porn.

3027
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:09,680
The porn though really is something that
changes everything.

3028
02:20:09,681 --> 02:20:12,650
Like watching porn and that really like 
you take it off and you're like,

3029
02:20:12,651 --> 02:20:15,470
oh no,
I felt closer to the girl than I thought

3030
02:20:15,471 --> 02:20:16,680
I would.
That's,

3031
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:20,060
that's going to save porn if,
if this does catch on.

3032
02:20:20,380 --> 02:20:25,380
Well maybe because it'll make it too.
If they can monetize the htc and the 

3033
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:28,680
oculus to the point where they can lock 
down the format.

3034
02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:30,430
Like the way they have the iphone locked
down.

3035
02:20:30,610 --> 02:20:34,060
Like you can't add anything to the app 
store unless apple gives you approval if

3036
02:20:34,061 --> 02:20:35,740
they can control it and that sort of 
same way.

3037
02:20:35,890 --> 02:20:40,420
I'm not saying tHat's the best thing for
everybody because I kinda liked the idea

3038
02:20:40,450 --> 02:20:41,930
of open source things.
One of the,

3039
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:47,610
I use a mac and I use it for convenience
and because I'm too busy I got have time

3040
02:20:48,431 --> 02:20:53,431
to fuck with some window shit,
but part of me likes the fact that 

3041
02:20:53,431 --> 02:20:55,090
windows is open and I've heard that 
argument before,

3042
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:57,550
like I've had conversations with people 
before with like,

3043
02:20:57,551 --> 02:20:59,800
look,
anybody could write shit for windows.

3044
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:04,930
You know,
it's like you can make products that 

3045
02:21:04,930 --> 02:21:04,930
work on windows,
you can make your own laptops,

3046
02:21:04,930 --> 02:21:05,700
you can put together your own desktops.

3047
02:21:05,710 --> 02:21:08,740
Like it's,
it's a much more open sort of a platform

3048
02:21:09,310 --> 02:21:13,030
than mac is because mac is the software 
developer and the hardware developer.

3049
02:21:13,031 --> 02:21:15,790
The good thing about that is everything 
works pretty fucking good.

3050
02:21:16,030 --> 02:21:20,830
Like you get a laptop from apple pretty 
fucking sure it's gonna work,

3051
02:21:20,831 --> 02:21:21,850
awesome,
etc.

3052
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:24,070
And died.
What happened?

3053
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:29,420
Oh just stop working.
But we've had every Fucking computer 

3054
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:29,420
dies.
Windows even,

3055
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:30,670
right?
They all die.

3056
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:34,090
What's my point?
My point is a point.

3057
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:39,480
If I had a point,
it would be that I'm taking it and 

3058
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:44,011
monetizing the applications that you 
would use for the htc vive or oculus 

3059
02:21:44,410 --> 02:21:45,370
only makes sense.

3060
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:47,150
I thiNk what we're going to see though 
is,

3061
02:21:47,151 --> 02:21:52,151
especially when the xbox and the 
playstation released their vr ca 

3062
02:21:52,151 --> 02:21:53,420
counterpoints,
I think that's when it's really going to

3063
02:21:53,421 --> 02:21:57,770
become an everyday thing and I think 
it's going to hurt the,

3064
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:03,100
the these kinds oF guys like the htcs 
and the oculus people a lot because I 

3065
02:22:03,621 --> 02:22:06,620
think it's going to be like computer 
games and then,

3066
02:22:06,621 --> 02:22:08,390
oh hey,
this is an x box.

3067
02:22:08,391 --> 02:22:13,391
You know,
that kind of killed pc gaming a lot and 

3068
02:22:13,391 --> 02:22:13,391
a lot of a lot of ways.

3069
02:22:13,391 --> 02:22:17,970
I think there's going to be a lot of 
copyright lawsuits for sure because 

3070
02:22:17,970 --> 02:22:20,971
they're going to have to figure out who.
Who invented the critical aspects for 

3071
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:26,040
like truly immersive virtual reality,
like what

3072
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,410
critical aspects are there?
Have they identified them?

3073
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:31,080
Who invented those?
Because those are huge.

3074
02:22:31,410 --> 02:22:36,410
You know,
if one guy figured out a way to make 

3075
02:22:36,410 --> 02:22:36,410
this,
the frame rate's incredibly smooth,

3076
02:22:36,410 --> 02:22:40,551
so there's no news,
no ability to discern when you moving 

3077
02:22:40,551 --> 02:22:40,551
left to right,
whether you're moving fast or slow.

3078
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:45,560
If one guy wrote some sort of a program 
or figured out something that I would 

3079
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:45,560
imagine.
I'm not a lawyer obviously,

3080
02:22:45,630 --> 02:22:47,940
but I'd imagine there'd be some sort of 
a case for that.

3081
02:22:47,941 --> 02:22:52,941
Like all these trolls,
patent trolls that apple gets hit with 

3082
02:22:52,941 --> 02:22:56,181
all the time.
Like I would imagine that that's going 

3083
02:22:56,181 --> 02:22:56,181
to be crazy when it comes to this stuff.
Yeah.

3084
02:22:56,181 --> 02:22:58,740
Unless It's already been licensed,
licensed it out,

3085
02:22:58,741 --> 02:23:00,660
you know,
it could be just some old guy going,

3086
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:02,220
oh,
you'll give me $2,000,000

3087
02:23:02,221 --> 02:23:02,640
a year.

3088
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:10,150
You might get brian's idea of commerce 
is an episode or a fucking one of the,

3089
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:19,071
uh,
back to the future movies where like a 

3090
02:23:19,071 --> 02:23:23,060
delorean and need some plutonium.
this guy just happens that I think 

3091
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:23,060
though,
I think,

3092
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,020
I think next year is when xbox is 
releasing.

3093
02:23:25,021 --> 02:23:30,021
There's,
I think playstation's coming out this 

3094
02:23:30,021 --> 02:23:30,021
year maybe.
Maybe.

3095
02:23:30,021 --> 02:23:30,021
I don't know.
Well,

3096
02:23:30,021 --> 02:23:30,690
I don't think you can patent virtual 
reality.

3097
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:33,780
I mean,
lawnmower man was low as 1992.

3098
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:35,800
What year was lawnmower man?
fInd that?

3099
02:23:36,590 --> 02:23:40,710
Let's guess.
I would guess 1994.

3100
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:42,450
Ninety four.
Ninety five.

3101
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:43,750
I say nine.
Two,

3102
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:44,870
nine,
two,

3103
02:23:45,070 --> 02:23:46,520
one.
Oh,

3104
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:49,680
by the way,
complete total guests.

3105
02:23:49,681 --> 02:23:51,330
I had no idea it was right.
Okay.

3106
02:23:51,331 --> 02:23:54,450
But total recall is also a virtual 
reality movie.

3107
02:23:54,990 --> 02:23:57,270
We watched the running man.
Oh,

3108
02:23:57,271 --> 02:23:58,560
that's terrible.
Horrible.

3109
02:23:59,070 --> 02:24:02,160
That did not have your childhood.
I'm telling you.

3110
02:24:02,161 --> 02:24:04,050
people were stupid as fuck back when we 
were kids.

3111
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:06,780
We didn't realize how dumb we were until
we watch old movies.

3112
02:24:07,350 --> 02:24:11,390
Was it was 1990 for a total recall.
Nineteen 90.

3113
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:13,230
Interesting.
Even earlier.

3114
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:14,890
Um,
so those are those.

3115
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,450
Those are vIrtual reality movies.
So it's not like virtual reality is like

3116
02:24:18,451 --> 02:24:23,040
some thing that someone invented.
It's really like a hope and a dream.

3117
02:24:23,070 --> 02:24:28,070
It's no waste to send a desert.
It's like everybody who lives a shitbag 

3118
02:24:28,070 --> 02:24:31,910
life is hoping there's gotta be some way
that I can be superman told her recall 

3119
02:24:32,341 --> 02:24:37,341
wasn't technically a virtual reality is 
false memories being implanted in your 

3120
02:24:37,341 --> 02:24:40,830
brain strain.
That's why he's being danger days.

3121
02:24:40,890 --> 02:24:44,010
That's true,
but it's kind of that reality is kind of

3122
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:47,520
virtual.
It's creating an artificial memory.

3123
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:48,300
no,
you're totally right.

3124
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:50,590
it was an artificial memory movie.
Yeah.

3125
02:24:50,591 --> 02:24:52,590
Strange days was a virtual reality 
movie,

3126
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:54,240
but there's been a few others.
RIght.

3127
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:57,450
There's been a few others.
But um,

3128
02:24:57,780 --> 02:24:59,460
what do you think with the.
Was the big one?

3129
02:24:59,490 --> 02:25:03,330
What's the biggest one?
Virtual reality movie matrix.

3130
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:04,710
The matrix.
Yeah.

3131
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:06,240
Yeah,
of course.

3132
02:25:06,270 --> 02:25:07,260
Right?
I don't even think of that.

3133
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:08,970
Yeah,
that's the biggest.

3134
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:11,310
So like,
I don't think anybody come along and say

3135
02:25:11,311 --> 02:25:16,311
they invented virtual reality,
like that's sort of like a whole.

3136
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:21,670
It's like a horn blowing in the distance
that we all knew it was coming and it's 

3137
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:22,500
not even like if even if you look at 
video games,

3138
02:25:22,501 --> 02:25:24,220
you can say video games are virtual 
reality.

3139
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:26,080
Just very bad versIons of him,
you know,

3140
02:25:26,081 --> 02:25:27,790
like,
like super mario brothers.

3141
02:25:27,791 --> 02:25:32,791
That's a virtual reality of a plumber.
What is this virtual reality is coming 

3142
02:25:33,341 --> 02:25:38,341
to your movie theater near you ends.
I've heard a lot of people talk about 

3143
02:25:38,341 --> 02:25:39,140
this as a pretty cool movie.
I don't think I've ever seen or heard of

3144
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:41,230
1999.
I think jude law's in it.

3145
02:25:41,320 --> 02:25:42,670
That's a name of a boner pill.
Jennifer.

3146
02:25:42,671 --> 02:25:44,330
Jason leigh.
Mmm.

3147
02:25:45,590 --> 02:25:46,780
I don't know.
I can't speak on it,

3148
02:25:46,781 --> 02:25:51,781
but I've heard a lot of people said that
it was like an under the radar kind of 

3149
02:25:51,781 --> 02:25:52,150
good movie came out in 1999,
which is the same year.

3150
02:25:52,151 --> 02:25:54,640
the matrix came out probably.
Why no one heard about it.

3151
02:25:55,060 --> 02:26:00,060
Huh?
It's supposed to be a good mom is a 

3152
02:26:00,060 --> 02:26:02,910
three and a half stars is that three and
a quarter stars for three and a half to 

3153
02:26:02,910 --> 02:26:05,881
eight.
A 71 fucking rotten tomatoes star 

3154
02:26:05,881 --> 02:26:08,200
search.
We covered in empire of allies.

3155
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:09,380
[inaudible]

3156
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:15,880
maybe.
Maybe the corporation realizes the 

3157
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:18,581
benefit isn't telling the truth.
THe way to make the money is not to 

3158
02:26:18,581 --> 02:26:23,110
create bad reviews are fake reviews.
The money is in being brutally honest 

3159
02:26:25,730 --> 02:26:30,730
and reaping the rewards of people coming
to read these really country review.

3160
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:37,540
That's why I get my news and information
from only hashtags nowadays.

3161
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:38,390
Oh,
that's good marriage.

3162
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:41,440
You do that like every time there's any 
helicopter in burbank.

3163
02:26:41,441 --> 02:26:43,330
I'm like hashtag burbank and like,
what's going on?

3164
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:44,860
This is what I do every morning when I 
wake up,

3165
02:26:44,861 --> 02:26:49,861
I go hashtag apocalypse.
See what's the most recent post I'm 

3166
02:26:49,861 --> 02:26:53,410
going to go back to sleep.
I go outside and shoot my rubber elk.

3167
02:26:53,470 --> 02:26:54,940
It's more Fast.
Inaccurate though.

3168
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:58,210
It's usually one guy going dude or the 
helicopter down on the street.

3169
02:26:58,420 --> 02:26:59,710
Well,
there's definitely some shit

3170
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:04,740
going down in these.
Like if you follow like social media 

3171
02:27:04,740 --> 02:27:07,720
news feeds,
like people that are on the scene,

3172
02:27:07,721 --> 02:27:10,480
they're talking about some cops shooting
some kid or something like that.

3173
02:27:10,481 --> 02:27:13,630
I mean that's one of the best ways to 
get some data.

3174
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:16,180
The question is the veracity of the 
data,

3175
02:27:16,210 --> 02:27:18,760
like whether or not it's god damn,
I sound like a professor.

3176
02:27:19,190 --> 02:27:24,190
I need to apply for a job somewhere.
Teaching the voracity of the data must 

3177
02:27:24,190 --> 02:27:27,520
come into question the biases of the 
person.

3178
02:27:27,521 --> 02:27:29,650
Did you go to their twitter page?
What are they into?

3179
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:33,070
How many noam chomsky books of the road?
Are you sure they're right?

3180
02:27:34,250 --> 02:27:34,610
Right?

3181
02:27:36,010 --> 02:27:38,590
You never know,
but you could find out some shit's going

3182
02:27:38,591 --> 02:27:39,790
down.
There's like a.

3183
02:27:39,791 --> 02:27:44,791
There was a video of the dallas shootout
between the guy and the cops,

3184
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:45,240
those,
uh,

3185
02:27:45,241 --> 02:27:48,100
the former military guy who killed all 
those fucking cops.

3186
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:49,970
Hmm.

3187
02:27:50,930 --> 02:27:53,290
Whew.
That's a tough video to watch,

3188
02:27:53,291 --> 02:27:54,700
man.
There's this one scene.

3189
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:58,210
I think it was him that did it or 
someone else who shot someone else.

3190
02:27:58,211 --> 02:28:03,211
I don't know how.
Here's all I saw a person was running 

3191
02:28:03,211 --> 02:28:04,540
down the street and a person in this,
this,

3192
02:28:04,541 --> 02:28:09,541
these two people involved in a gunfight 
and one guy shot behind the guy and hit 

3193
02:28:11,741 --> 02:28:16,741
the wall behind them and then use that 
as a distraction to run in front of him 

3194
02:28:16,871 --> 02:28:18,790
and shoot him when he's laying down.
I was like,

3195
02:28:18,791 --> 02:28:20,950
wow,
I was.

3196
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:22,310
That guy has done

3197
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:26,390
this before games.
I hate this.

3198
02:28:26,391 --> 02:28:28,800
I hate to say that.
It really is video guys.

3199
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:30,830
Well,
in this case,

3200
02:28:30,831 --> 02:28:32,900
if it's the same guy who killed all 
those people,

3201
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:35,750
it's a guy who was in war in the first 
place.

3202
02:28:35,751 --> 02:28:37,700
So we'd actually play the ultimate video
game.

3203
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:40,940
He's playing actual war,
but these school shootings and stuff,

3204
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:45,950
man,
do you remember that call of duty when 

3205
02:28:45,950 --> 02:28:47,711
you walk into the airport?
You just mow down people like you just 

3206
02:28:47,711 --> 02:28:48,380
pretty much go into lax with a machine 
gun.

3207
02:28:48,381 --> 02:28:51,470
Just start spraying everybody.
That alone.

3208
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:53,580
I remember you playing a going.
I'm.

3209
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:58,660
I can't believe my eyes and brain are 
seeing this right now and I've played so

3210
02:28:59,601 --> 02:29:04,601
many video games before that I've gone 
outside and forgot that I'm not in that 

3211
02:29:04,601 --> 02:29:05,390
video game still.
This is crazy.

3212
02:29:05,391 --> 02:29:08,630
So they gunned down all the people.
Oh shit.

3213
02:29:08,660 --> 02:29:10,600
And you're just walking through the 
airport doing this.

3214
02:29:10,610 --> 02:29:12,950
You're finding people hiding and stores 
and shit.

3215
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,950
What the fuck?
Yeah.

3216
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:19,140
Oh my god.
This is so your brand.

3217
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:23,480
So you saw that trump support or suction
cup.

3218
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:28,520
Michael swimmer guy.
See I'm all in favor of video games and 

3219
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:32,600
I have a problem with quake like 
violence,

3220
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:35,960
but this is fucked up because this is 
murder.

3221
02:29:35,961 --> 02:29:40,961
You're just running around and 
assassinating average moms and dads and 

3222
02:29:40,961 --> 02:29:45,251
brothers and sisters like this is a 
video game where you're deriving 

3223
02:29:45,251 --> 02:29:47,180
pleasure from gunning people down.
Like why would you.

3224
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:50,740
And this is available to buy at target 
is.

3225
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:51,570
It is.
Yeah.

3226
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:54,410
This is call of duty like last few years
ago,

3227
02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:57,770
and look at this guy's walking through 
the fucking starbucks.

3228
02:29:57,771 --> 02:29:58,720
Yeah,
the bookstore.

3229
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:02,720
A choice he's making just gunned down.
Don't have to do this.

3230
02:30:02,730 --> 02:30:07,730
And again,
still definitely shoot for you instead 

3231
02:30:07,730 --> 02:30:10,871
basically.
But so you can just decide to be a 

3232
02:30:10,871 --> 02:30:10,871
killer and it guess what you're going to
do joe,

3233
02:30:10,871 --> 02:30:14,920
you are actually going to not,
you're going to actually shoot people 

3234
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:15,350
because I've played this and I'm like 
this is horrible.

3235
02:30:15,351 --> 02:30:16,100
Why am I doing?

3236
02:30:19,490 --> 02:30:21,790
And I was like,
even like people hiding in the back,

3237
02:30:21,870 --> 02:30:24,290
please note and be like,
I'll talk to them.

3238
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:25,130
I'm like,
yeah,

3239
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:28,190
you're hiding boy.
And then he shoot them.

3240
02:30:28,250 --> 02:30:29,540
Yeah.
Oh my god.

3241
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:31,960
It's like grand theft auto.
I through the same shit man.

3242
02:30:31,980 --> 02:30:36,290
Like why am I doing this?
Like I engraved theft auto.

3243
02:30:36,291 --> 02:30:37,940
It's a lot more fucked up.
I mean,

3244
02:30:38,410 --> 02:30:39,830
you know,
it started with the hooker.

3245
02:30:40,100 --> 02:30:41,890
Give me a blow job and then killing her.
You know,

3246
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:44,000
a couple of grand theft auto first came 
out.

3247
02:30:44,590 --> 02:30:46,040
Do you have to kill her?
No.

3248
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:47,390
No.
You should just give her money.

3249
02:30:47,391 --> 02:30:49,940
Let her go about her way and saw,
oh,

3250
02:30:49,970 --> 02:30:54,970
I killed my every time.
Get my money back and you killed a 

3251
02:30:54,970 --> 02:30:58,361
hooker.
You get your money back and if she has 

3252
02:30:58,361 --> 02:30:58,361
any extra money.
Oh my god,

3253
02:30:58,361 --> 02:30:58,850
dude,
that's so crazy.

3254
02:30:58,900 --> 02:31:00,380
But like,
like in grand theft auto,

3255
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,940
I don't even play the missions.

3256
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:06,970
I'll just go to the gun store,
get as much as I possibly possibly can 

3257
02:31:06,970 --> 02:31:10,800
and I have like this one part Where 
height on this second floor of this 

3258
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:13,811
house and I pretty much or the comedy 
store hanging out at the comedy store 

3259
02:31:13,811 --> 02:31:17,260
and I pretty much just put it down 
grenades and bombs and blow up until 

3260
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:20,831
there are so many cars.
It's just a pile of meat on sunset 

3261
02:31:20,831 --> 02:31:24,430
boulevard and it's great fun.
yeah,

3262
02:31:25,030 --> 02:31:28,950
it is fucked up that you can be a 
monster and with no consequences.

3263
02:31:29,010 --> 02:31:32,250
I guess in my head I jusT have to say 
they're all rapists or something,

3264
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:34,320
but here's the.
But here's the problem.

3265
02:31:34,321 --> 02:31:39,321
Like at what point in time is this going
to become way more disturbing because 

3266
02:31:39,601 --> 02:31:42,630
it's going to be virtual,
not virtual yet.

3267
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:47,660
It's just you're looking at a screen and
have you seen the virtual version of 

3268
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:47,660
this yet?

3269
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:47,670
That they are very aware that it's not 
real.

3270
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:49,650
Right.
Like at what point in time are you going

3271
02:31:49,651 --> 02:31:52,920
to be not aware that it's not real?
You gotta throw a grenade at this guy.

3272
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:54,300
Really?
I tell you,

3273
02:31:54,301 --> 02:31:55,490
jane anthro?
Yeah.

3274
02:31:55,540 --> 02:31:58,110
Oh yeah.
I strap like sticky bombs onto people.

3275
02:31:58,350 --> 02:32:01,260
But uh,
it's gotten to the point where I used to

3276
02:32:01,261 --> 02:32:02,850
play games.
Not this game,

3277
02:32:02,851 --> 02:32:07,260
but city of heroes is like torkey game.
But I played it straight for a month,

3278
02:32:07,261 --> 02:32:09,510
like every single hour of the day.
A long time ago.

3279
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:12,870
He chose a broken bottle.
Yeah.

3280
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:16,380
Oh,
jesus christ.

3281
02:32:16,410 --> 02:32:17,880
You should see what I did in the strip 
club.

3282
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:20,520
I catch it on fire and I just burned 
strippers.

3283
02:32:20,521 --> 02:32:25,521
Man.
I put my bike in the front door so they 

3284
02:32:25,521 --> 02:32:25,521
can't escape.
It's great.

3285
02:32:25,521 --> 02:32:26,310
This is crazy,
man.

3286
02:32:28,050 --> 02:32:33,050
Oh my god.
He just stabbed like this is so fucked 

3287
02:32:33,050 --> 02:32:33,050
up.

3288
02:32:33,050 --> 02:32:33,900
He stabbing him in the ass of the broken
bottle.

3289
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:35,880
Oh,
jesus christ.

3290
02:32:36,210 --> 02:32:36,860
Look at this,
right?

3291
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:38,370
It's butthole.
Look is buttholes bleeding.

3292
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:42,640
This is so fucked up.
You know what,

3293
02:32:42,660 --> 02:32:44,100
man?
Tipper gore was right,

3294
02:32:44,460 --> 02:32:49,460
she saw the future,
she was trying to stop rap lyrics and 

3295
02:32:49,460 --> 02:32:52,140
this is ultimately what was down the 
road and how girls wife,

3296
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:57,170
a lot of people don't remember that.
Al gore's wife in the 19 eighties went 

3297
02:32:57,170 --> 02:33:00,771
on a crusade against violent music and a
violent lyrics and rap and she was uh,

3298
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:07,880
she was hated.
It was really interesting and she just 

3299
02:33:07,880 --> 02:33:10,950
shut the fuck up when he was running for
president with the chickens.

3300
02:33:10,951 --> 02:33:12,380
Two live crew.
Yeah,

3301
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:15,150
she was.
She was against a bunch of them.

3302
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:17,730
I think it was.
Ice tea had an issue with her.

3303
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:21,380
Let's get naked and fuck tonight.
That was one of jams.

3304
02:33:22,410 --> 02:33:27,410
That was a joint,
a nice ice t joint fused.

3305
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:30,720
Uh,
I think purple rain,

3306
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:35,920
which is what she used to lead that 
ended up with the rental advisory.

3307
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:41,960
Use that as an example.
It migHt have been that or something 

3308
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:41,960
else.
I'm reading fifth.

3309
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:41,960
Sorry.
I lost it.

3310
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:45,320
Telling you we're going to take jamie 
ride to a doctor now.

3311
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:50,610
Dr.
You're going to take jamie to that talk 

3312
02:33:50,610 --> 02:33:50,700
as minute clinic clinics,
working with meg,

3313
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:54,180
your head injuries.
Prince gave us parental guidance.

3314
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:57,100
What if we find that out?
You're allergic to me.

3315
02:33:57,220 --> 02:34:00,180
You have like some black mold in your 
asshole or something.

3316
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:02,910
You're just allergic to my smell.
Yo.

3317
02:34:02,911 --> 02:34:03,520
Dude.
I was.

3318
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:05,250
Here's some,
some crazy shit.

3319
02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:11,180
Um,
did you know that like if someone's 

3320
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:13,380
allergic to horses they can't even ride 
in a carriage behind a horse.

3321
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:14,520
Oh really?
Yeah.

3322
02:34:14,910 --> 02:34:16,620
And I was thinking of this,
you know,

3323
02:34:16,650 --> 02:34:18,040
women,
some women

3324
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:21,250
are literally allergic to their man's 
come,

3325
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:25,360
like the guy shoots loads on them.
They get rashes all over their body.

3326
02:34:25,361 --> 02:34:26,350
Like what?
Like,

3327
02:34:29,930 --> 02:34:32,140
like literally some demonic shit,
man,

3328
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:36,250
like a guy shoots a load on you and like
carved his name,

3329
02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:41,880
takes his load and writes it with his 
finger and just leaves you there to dry 

3330
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:42,700
and you have the mark of the demon and 
stomach.

3331
02:34:43,090 --> 02:34:47,020
Is that because of food allergies that 
maybe that's inside the come?

3332
02:34:47,021 --> 02:34:52,021
Maybe.
Maybe he or she is allergic to peanuts 

3333
02:34:52,021 --> 02:34:52,990
and he just eats nonstop peanuts and she
does a very good question.

3334
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:55,060
It's probably something like that could 
be.

3335
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:58,630
I'm wondering what it meant.
I wonder if there's a reason jamie,

3336
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:04,200
research that find out what makes come 
allergenic and uh,

3337
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:11,380
feel free to deduct any research from 
your taxes.

3338
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:14,740
I know like some,
some girls do that ph balance just,

3339
02:35:14,741 --> 02:35:16,720
it's totally different from you or 
whatever.

3340
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:21,720
And they break out or to of this is 
saying she was dosed with diagnosed with

3341
02:35:21,941 --> 02:35:26,220
human seminal plasma hypersensitivity 
and allergy to seaman.

3342
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:31,560
The problem with guessing that is we 
don't know how many different people 

3343
02:35:31,871 --> 02:35:36,871
came on her and within it wasn't not at 
all had the same effect.

3344
02:35:37,511 --> 02:35:42,511
And what's the pe ratio to do a double 
blind placebo controlled gang.

3345
02:35:43,570 --> 02:35:44,800
Not gang bang,
but like,

3346
02:35:44,801 --> 02:35:46,060
um,
what would it be?

3347
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:49,480
A bunch of users jerked off on a girl 
circle jerk.

3348
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:53,200
there's a little peon come right circle 
jerk involves a cracker though.

3349
02:35:53,201 --> 02:35:56,390
No,
Like an official sort of sloppy biscuit.

3350
02:35:57,490 --> 02:36:02,490
Loves that shit.
I always thought that a circle jerk 

3351
02:36:02,490 --> 02:36:04,590
involved.
Just a bunch of dudes jerking off 

3352
02:36:04,590 --> 02:36:04,590
together,
which was weird enough.

3353
02:36:04,590 --> 02:36:05,950
then I heard that like the last guy to 
come just to eat the cracker.

3354
02:36:06,230 --> 02:36:09,700
What kind of a fucking world are we 
inventing?

3355
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:12,370
Why do you think bert so fat from all 
those crackers come?

3357
02:36:17,830 --> 02:36:17,920

Cracker.

3358
02:36:17,921 --> 02:36:22,921
I mean,
unless there's a billion calories in it 

3359
02:36:22,921 --> 02:36:23,410
as long time ago.
Her tom's been working out with chicken.

3360

A lot of water.
He's your helPer is fat.

3361

3362
02:36:27,470 --> 02:36:30,350
Whereas versus team thompson against my 
own mom.

Thompson water champ.
Yeah.

3364
02:36:32,020 --> 02:36:33,410
tom is the water champ.
Chris.

3365
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:36,940
Christina never drinks water.
They don't drink water.

3366
02:36:37,180 --> 02:36:42,180
Do you know they take a shower together 
all the time and tom piece on her and 

3367
02:36:42,180 --> 02:36:43,390
like what would she Be saying this on 
the internet?

3368
02:36:44,550 --> 02:36:45,520
Five guys.
Well,

3369
02:36:45,850 --> 02:36:50,850
I would do that too if I was married.
Or did you ever told a crazy story I'd 

3370
02:36:50,850 --> 02:36:51,540
never heard joey diaz told about on 
there.

3371
02:36:51,580 --> 02:36:53,320
Maybe it was on their show that about 
him.

3372
02:36:53,321 --> 02:36:56,290
Shit in the shower and just push it 
through,

3373
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:58,600
throw it,
throw it in the toilet,

3374
02:36:58,601 --> 02:37:03,601
and that I believe that shit on his on a
couple of years ago to stop because he 

3375
02:37:04,131 --> 02:37:05,800
got caught by his wife.
He got caught.

3376
02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:08,800
Two ideas.
Is this traits average blue belt?

3377
02:37:09,310 --> 02:37:10,100
He's a savage.
Yeah.

3378
02:37:10,101 --> 02:37:12,090
He got his blue belt in jujitsu.
Fucking shit.

3379
02:37:12,110 --> 02:37:16,160
Emit blue belt in brazilian jujitsu.
He's doing brazilian

3380
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:21,160
jujitsu for I believe four or five years
now and joe has been like really into 

3381
02:37:23,241 --> 02:37:24,420
it.
It's helped them.

3382
02:37:24,660 --> 02:37:27,500
I don't want to get that wrong,
so if I got that number wrong,

3383
02:37:27,501 --> 02:37:29,780
but if I guessed it,
I think it would be four or five years,

3384
02:37:30,050 --> 02:37:32,150
but he really loves it.
He loves it for fitness,

3385
02:37:32,151 --> 02:37:33,500
for,
for health.

3386
02:37:33,650 --> 02:37:35,570
You know?
HE's super humble about it,

3387
02:37:35,571 --> 02:37:40,571
but if he does it all the time,
I bet you every single person who goes 

3388
02:37:40,571 --> 02:37:42,500
against tax out he's going to have is 
blacked out in like two months.

3389
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:45,740
It's like the smell,
the smell.

3390
02:37:46,480 --> 02:37:48,240
What are you saying?
SMells now.

3391
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:51,770
Think about these things before you say,
I remember climbing up the stairs.

3392
02:37:51,771 --> 02:37:56,771
You'll see margins pc,
this joke about you want to see you walk

3393
02:37:58,940 --> 02:38:01,250
by me when I'm farting up a flight of 
stairs.

3394
02:38:01,430 --> 02:38:06,430
You'll see.
You'll see marsh has no tolerance for 

3395
02:38:08,391 --> 02:38:09,200
nonsense.

3396
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:14,320
It's like if eddie bravo starts talking 
about eddie ufo or anything like crazy 

3397
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:17,990
crypto fucking duology type shit or 
whatever eddie's into recently,

3398
02:38:18,230 --> 02:38:19,970
jelly will fucking get up and leave the 
room.

3399
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:25,870
BuT joe rogan,
I don't want to listen to your fucking 

3400
02:38:25,870 --> 02:38:25,870
you up.
We'll talk.

3401
02:38:25,870 --> 02:38:25,870
Okay.
I know.

3402
02:38:25,870 --> 02:38:25,880
Yeah.
That show with duncan.

3403
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:28,580
You went looking for bigfoot.
Leave them in the fucking forest.

3404
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:31,460
Okay.
Gentlemen.

3405
02:38:31,700 --> 02:38:35,210
He used to call tim duncan and satanic,
but satan worshiper.

3406
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:40,980
She fucking member when anton levay or 
stand,

3407
02:38:41,360 --> 02:38:46,360
whichever one it was,
the young guy got married and duncan 

3408
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:49,451
performed at his wedding and sick and he
invited a bunch of us to go to his 

3409
02:38:49,451 --> 02:38:50,290
wedding.
So we went to his wedding and,

3410
02:38:50,470 --> 02:38:55,470
and,
and duncan was involved with this like 

3411
02:38:55,470 --> 02:38:55,470
satanic,
fake,

3412
02:38:55,470 --> 02:38:57,980
satanic wedding day foley's ex wife was 
there too.

3413
02:38:58,820 --> 02:39:00,590
And a satanic duncan.
Yeah,

3414
02:39:00,591 --> 02:39:02,510
because he had this routine that he 
should do.

3415
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:05,060
I don't know if he still does it.
He was on his phone.

3416
02:39:05,140 --> 02:39:07,130
What does he say?
Give me some volume.

3417
02:39:10,060 --> 02:39:15,060
You play this full screen to joey 
duncan.

3418
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:22,000
Duncan trussell.
We've got to have a little talk you.

3419
02:39:22,010 --> 02:39:23,920
When I sit on.
What's this?

3420
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:26,050
What's this fucking devil shit.
I'm hearing.

3421
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:29,470
Everybody's telling me you have a 
worshiper.

3422
02:39:30,820 --> 02:39:33,070
Duncan duncan.
We can't have that.

3423
02:39:33,690 --> 02:39:35,590
Can't have that.
You understand that you're a comedIan.

3424
02:39:36,140 --> 02:39:37,270
No more of this devil.
Shit.

3425
02:39:37,290 --> 02:39:39,680
You scared.
I'm good.

3426
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:44,990
I got it from four different people.
Not even people I got from one of joe's 

3427
02:39:44,990 --> 02:39:49,201
friends,
but everybody else at the store is 

3428
02:39:49,201 --> 02:39:50,751
saying the devil.
You're walking around with a fucking 

3429
02:39:50,751 --> 02:39:52,860
crucifix on your head and shit that you 
put a little fucking tattoo on you and 

3430
02:39:54,491 --> 02:39:55,640
your score was six,
six,

3431
02:39:55,660 --> 02:39:59,180
six that you're calling yourself duncan.
This duncan.

3432
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:01,120
We can't have this no more.
You understand me?

3433
02:40:02,410 --> 02:40:04,430
If we have to kill a little homo will 
kill him.

3434
02:40:04,630 --> 02:40:05,890
No,
we can't have.

3435
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:06,870
Legit.

3436
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:08,800
You're a catholic.
Were you raised catholic?

3437
02:40:10,090 --> 02:40:12,430
But were you raised?
All right.

3438
02:40:12,431 --> 02:40:15,180
That'll be fucking no more of this 
double shit.

3439
02:40:15,210 --> 02:40:17,240
We can't have this.
You scaring people.

3440
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:20,640
These people are white people and just 
of them bro.

3441
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:23,280
They want to call the authorities and 
shit.

3442
02:40:23,281 --> 02:40:28,281
You know what I'm saying?
His eyes caught by her dog.

3443
02:40:28,580 --> 02:40:33,580
What's his name by the store?
The guy who does the app show wants to 

3444
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:35,680
call the cops.
This is that the atlanta punchline.

3445
02:40:35,820 --> 02:40:40,820
The old bro.
He's got four people called the house 

3446
02:40:40,820 --> 02:40:41,220
and left messages.
They're worried about duncan trussell.

3447
02:40:41,630 --> 02:40:44,140
This shit has to happen.
Don't get in the game looking.

3448
02:40:44,420 --> 02:40:46,470
They take kids like you,
they but fuck you.

3449
02:40:46,700 --> 02:40:50,610
And they picked the same cross up here 
and then you know what I'm saying?

3450
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:52,920
You can't come back from that.
You can't recover from that.

3451
02:40:52,921 --> 02:40:54,360
I'm not fucking laughing here.

3452
02:41:03,150 --> 02:41:04,260
Yeah,
I have.

3453
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:06,250
Okay.

3454
02:41:12,070 --> 02:41:15,610
And I remember going when at that time 
of that period of time,

3455
02:41:15,611 --> 02:41:18,460
like me and duncan,
I would always go to his friend's house,

3456
02:41:18,880 --> 02:41:23,880
that guy and you'd get these houses.
It was like people that believed in st.

3457
02:41:24,610 --> 02:41:27,430
Maybe not seriously or anything,
but I remember going,

3458
02:41:27,431 --> 02:41:28,600
wow,
dunkin is.

3459
02:41:28,601 --> 02:41:32,020
It's some deep shit to.
Dunkin was always,

3460
02:41:32,021 --> 02:41:33,520
I think a joke,
but it was.

3461
02:41:33,640 --> 02:41:36,970
We were hanging out with really intense 
tense people,

3462
02:41:36,971 --> 02:41:37,660
you know,
like.

3463
02:41:37,770 --> 02:41:39,070
Yeah,
super intense.

3464
02:41:39,190 --> 02:41:40,210
Yeah,
yeah.

3465
02:41:40,211 --> 02:41:45,211
Well duncan's into intense humans and 
intense ideas and for awhile he was 

3466
02:41:45,211 --> 02:41:49,590
really attracted to this idea not of 
satanism in that satan is an actual 

3467
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:52,570
being in the devil is real and that 
you're praying to the devil,

3468
02:41:52,870 --> 02:41:56,050
but satanism in that these people were 
like essentially hedonist.

3469
02:41:56,080 --> 02:42:01,080
They were just like seeking pleasure and
trying to have as much fun as they 

3470
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:01,080
could,
but they were also allowing other people

3471
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:03,940
to do it too.
So you like redefining what satanism is

3472
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:05,130
and like,
well,

3473
02:42:05,131 --> 02:42:10,131
if that's okay,
that's the problem with all ideologies 

3474
02:42:10,131 --> 02:42:11,640
like you're locked into,
if you want to call it satanism and it's

3475
02:42:11,641 --> 02:42:12,300
all,
hey man,

3476
02:42:12,301 --> 02:42:14,840
just be free.
Just have a good time and you know,

3477
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:18,420
just fucking do whatever feels good.
Terrible.

3478
02:42:18,421 --> 02:42:23,421
Don't get it.
But there's a big difference between 

3479
02:42:23,421 --> 02:42:23,421
that in and of itself,
which is an awesome idea,

3480
02:42:23,430 --> 02:42:25,320
right?
Like everybody agrees like you should.

3481
02:42:25,321 --> 02:42:26,100
Yeah.
Have fun,

3482
02:42:26,101 --> 02:42:31,101
man.
We're only here for a little bit at a 

3483
02:42:31,101 --> 02:42:31,101
time.
If you get your toes sucked,

3484
02:42:31,101 --> 02:42:33,210
fucking get your toe socks.
Who cares,

3485
02:42:33,270 --> 02:42:38,270
right,
but there is a big fucking difference 

3486
02:42:38,270 --> 02:42:39,960
between that and something that's 
connected to a demon.

3487
02:42:40,400 --> 02:42:43,290
It's connected to a fallen angel who 
became a devil,

3488
02:42:43,470 --> 02:42:48,470
who lives in us,
a smoldering inferno in the middle of 

3489
02:42:48,470 --> 02:42:51,801
the earth,
and if he gets a hold of you and you 

3490
02:42:51,801 --> 02:42:52,620
don't listen to god,
you will burn to the end of the time.

3491
02:42:53,720 --> 02:42:55,950
What?
What are you retarded?

3492
02:42:56,250 --> 02:42:57,540
Why does it have to be connected to 
that?

3493
02:42:57,740 --> 02:43:01,150
Why is that good feeling and having a 
good time and pleasure and

3494
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:04,840
being a whole bag if that's what you're 
into.

3495
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:06,630
If you're a girl you like,
we're in dental,

3496
02:43:06,631 --> 02:43:09,570
floss up your ass and going out to bars 
and sucking three dicks.

3497
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:11,470
Who cares?
Right?

3498
02:43:11,710 --> 02:43:12,010
Why does it

3499
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:14,230
have to be connected to the devil?
Because that's a sin.

3500
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:18,510
All those are synced to enough.
Brian red band.

3501
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:24,100
I forsake v enough.
Enough with these fuckers.

3502
02:43:24,670 --> 02:43:25,930
One last little thing I want to show 
you.

3503
02:43:25,931 --> 02:43:28,720
I have you seen this new game maybe or 
may not have.

3504
02:43:28,721 --> 02:43:30,830
It's called no man's sky.
Whoops.

3505
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:33,700
What's really interesting about it is,
as far as I understand,

3506
02:43:33,770 --> 02:43:36,150
I'm been trying to figure it out,
the uh,

3507
02:43:36,690 --> 02:43:41,690
there's,
it's an unexplored space and if there's 

3508
02:43:41,690 --> 02:43:46,080
something like 10 billion planets that 
are being populated in this multiplayer 

3509
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:47,650
universe,
and as a player,

3510
02:43:47,651 --> 02:43:51,550
what you're supposed to do is go and 
explore and find species and planets.

3511
02:43:51,610 --> 02:43:56,610
Hold on.
Can you say 10 billion planets in the 

3512
02:43:56,610 --> 02:43:57,970
first 24 hours or two days?
This was up.

3513
02:43:57,971 --> 02:44:01,570
They've already named more species in 
this game than there are on earth.

3514
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,250
It.
See?

3515
02:44:02,330 --> 02:44:04,660
It's all computer generated.
So when you play the game,

3516
02:44:04,661 --> 02:44:08,290
it automatically generates a planet.
So it's just random random shit.

3517
02:44:08,380 --> 02:44:09,370
Yeah,
I get that.

3518
02:44:09,371 --> 02:44:10,840
But what the fuck?
Say that again?

3519
02:44:10,841 --> 02:44:13,840
It's more species in this game and how 
many days,

3520
02:44:13,930 --> 02:44:18,050
and I'll look up that article that says 
more than more speed,

3521
02:44:18,730 --> 02:44:23,730
but you know,
the reviews of this game is pretty 

3522
02:44:23,730 --> 02:44:24,190
boring.
Oh my god.

3523
02:44:24,220 --> 02:44:25,990
It's just a,
it's a little slower of a game.

3524
02:44:25,991 --> 02:44:28,750
It's not like a first person shooter.
It's not that typical kind of game,

3525
02:44:28,751 --> 02:44:31,330
but it's supposedly a truly open 
universe.

3526
02:44:31,331 --> 02:44:36,331
And the game just came out this week.
A lot of people have been really 

3527
02:44:36,331 --> 02:44:36,331
anticipating it for like the last couple
months.

3528
02:44:36,331 --> 02:44:39,050
So is this game,
it says truly open universe.

3529
02:44:39,170 --> 02:44:42,380
So is this game constantly inventing 
itself on the fly?

3530
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:47,330
Oh my god.
Sort of like real dude.

3531
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:52,340
Do you have any idea what it's going to 
be like when that's on the htc vive and 

3532
02:44:52,340 --> 02:44:53,570
we're not in 2016,
but when they're in 2000,

3533
02:44:53,571 --> 02:44:57,440
67,
we were living in another world man.

3534
02:44:57,710 --> 02:45:02,710
For instance,
in one night we hit 10 million species 

3535
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:06,251
discovered in mms.
That's more than has been discovered on 

3536
02:45:06,251 --> 02:45:08,330
earth.
What is going on?

3537
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:12,380
It is a testament to how amazing our 
network coders are.

3538
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:14,630
That discoveries are still working at 
all.

3539
02:45:14,780 --> 02:45:17,630
Wow.
This is yesterday.

3540
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:20,720
We're already in a simulation,
joe.

3541
02:45:21,320 --> 02:45:23,430
It is for them.
You know,

3542
02:45:23,431 --> 02:45:28,340
it's like that's a simulation.
I mean it's not the best one,

3543
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:32,090
but it's like taking a motorola startac.
IF someone says,

3544
02:45:32,091 --> 02:45:33,080
do you have a cell phone?
And you're like,

3545
02:45:33,081 --> 02:45:33,710
yes I do.

3546
02:45:33,740 --> 02:45:36,710
And you pull out a motorola startac like
that's on a fucking cell phone.

3547
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:39,170
But it is,
it's just not a good one.

3548
02:45:39,850 --> 02:45:41,870
Like are we already in the simulation?
Yeah.

3549
02:45:41,930 --> 02:45:43,010
Yeah.
It's already happened.

3550
02:45:43,011 --> 02:45:45,740
It's just not good yet.
You kind of know it's there,

3551
02:45:46,370 --> 02:45:51,370
but it's,
it's definitely a simulation and it's 

3552
02:45:51,370 --> 02:45:53,060
getting way weirder.
It's getting way weirder.

3553
02:45:54,170 --> 02:45:59,170
I feel like when I pay attention to the 
news and I paid attention to the 

3554
02:45:59,170 --> 02:46:04,031
internet and I just stepped back and 
we'll look at this crazy trump clinton 

3555
02:46:05,331 --> 02:46:10,331
race and I look at this.
This is bizarre,

3556
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:14,860
strange world that we find ourselves 
sorta like waking up in.

3557
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:21,570
I can only imagine how fucking weird 
it's going to be in a decade.

3558
02:46:22,890 --> 02:46:27,890
I can only imagine.
We should really consider getting water 

3559
02:46:29,160 --> 02:46:32,700
and shelter and figuring out how to get 
solar power.

3560
02:46:32,701 --> 02:46:36,980
We can get this kid really fall apart.
That guy in Virginia does that.

3561
02:46:37,590 --> 02:46:39,960
They took away as the land.
What guy?

3562
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:41,360
There's this,
I think it was Virginia.

3563
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:44,550
They took away his land because he was 
off the grid,

3564
02:46:44,580 --> 02:46:49,350
like he did everything off the grid,
so he was not paying any city utility at

3565
02:46:49,351 --> 02:46:54,351
all and they didn't like it.
So they just took his land away from 

3566
02:46:54,351 --> 02:46:54,351
them.
Which guys?

3567
02:46:54,351 --> 02:46:56,010
This uh,
if you google image was on the news,

3568
02:46:56,520 --> 02:47:01,520
Virginia homeowner fighting to keep 
property from being taken away by 

3569
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:01,520
eminent domain.
Yeah,

3570
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:06,470
I think that's it.
It's just putting him in that domain is 

3571
02:47:06,470 --> 02:47:07,170
different than when a company gets from 
february.

3572
02:47:07,940 --> 02:47:10,050
It's old shit bro.
Just too new.

3573
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:15,100
I'm going to.
Domain is scary because I'm going a 

3574
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:15,100
domain is like if they're trying to put 
a highway through something,

3575
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:18,010
they can just buy your house.
You have to move a put,

3576
02:47:18,690 --> 02:47:23,690
you know,
like you see those houses that are like 

3577
02:47:23,690 --> 02:47:23,690
on the side of the four,
oh five.

3578
02:47:23,690 --> 02:47:25,020
They're doomed.
Doomed.

3579
02:47:25,530 --> 02:47:30,530
They're going to spread that bitch.
You can't keep all these fucking people 

3580
02:47:30,530 --> 02:47:30,530
together.
It's just not working.

3581
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:33,280
There's too many of us.
Unless everybody gets automatic cars,

3582
02:47:33,281 --> 02:47:38,281
there's no more accidents.
And even then we're going to realize 

3583
02:47:38,281 --> 02:47:40,971
what a bottleneck.
Just the sheer volume of humans there 

3584
02:47:40,971 --> 02:47:43,491
are.
I'm pretty sure that's what's going to 

3585
02:47:43,491 --> 02:47:44,841
happen.
Like even as China just released their 

3586
02:47:44,841 --> 02:47:44,841
first neW bus

3587
02:47:44,841 --> 02:47:44,841
cars

3588
02:47:44,841 --> 02:47:48,960
underneath the bus and I'm going to have
you seen that where it's like it looks 

3589
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:49,880
like this and then the in the middle 
looks like a,

3590
02:47:50,090 --> 02:47:52,300
like you're going through a bridge or a 
tunnel.

3591
02:47:52,570 --> 02:47:57,570
He so cArs can drive through it in the 
top part is the bus part and so things 

3592
02:47:57,941 --> 02:48:00,000
like that.
Let's say they're at.

3593
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:03,490
I saw that it's like it's like a train 
more than a bus,

3594
02:48:03,491 --> 02:48:04,550
right?
Because the tracks.

3595
02:48:04,551 --> 02:48:09,551
Yeah.
But things like that I think are going 

3596
02:48:09,551 --> 02:48:12,091
to improve a lot.
I mean imagine if that was just a non 

3597
02:48:12,091 --> 02:48:15,540
continuous retards going to be playing 
pokemon and slam into your fucking 

3598
02:48:15,540 --> 02:48:16,240
train.
Knock it over on a traffic.

3599
02:48:16,420 --> 02:48:17,550
Right?
Yeah.

3600
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:22,760
That's the problem is when you have that
and retain things that are like regular 

3601
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:24,070
cars that are driving the same road 
together.

3602
02:48:24,250 --> 02:48:27,670
If you go under someone,
you're almost like in contact with them.

3603
02:48:27,671 --> 02:48:29,710
So if you get an accident while you're 
under there,

3604
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:36,000
guys will change lanes while they're 
underneath those buses and they'll 

3605
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:36,000
collide into each other and they'll 
fucking spin the,

3606
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,010
the bus out of control to go off the 
rails

3607
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:42,420
crashed and other people,
the pulp will die in a horrible crash on

3608
02:48:42,421 --> 02:48:42,960
the four.
Oh,

3609
02:48:42,961 --> 02:48:47,961
five in los Angeles.
The best pub we've ever had was last at 

3610
02:48:47,961 --> 02:48:51,030
this ridiculous policy of public 
transportation in los angeles has always

3611
02:48:51,031 --> 02:48:54,570
been an individual transportation city.
People love their cars.

3612
02:48:54,600 --> 02:48:55,830
they love to be by themselves.

3613
02:48:56,800 --> 02:48:59,050
I'm looking at this article.
I found out this,

3614
02:48:59,051 --> 02:49:01,210
uh,
this might not even be real,

3615
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:03,490
like this thing obviously exists.
It's a real thing.

3616
02:49:03,491 --> 02:49:05,740
But the.
See this exact one that showed last week

3617
02:49:05,741 --> 02:49:07,350
or whenever this came out was the same

3618
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:10,980
whatever train bus you want to call that
showed in a test that they use six years

3619
02:49:10,981 --> 02:49:15,981
before this.
And it was only on like a 300 meter 

3620
02:49:15,981 --> 02:49:19,160
piece of land and 30.
Even now this says like if this project 

3621
02:49:19,171 --> 02:49:21,060
is even feasible or if it's even real,
wasn't.

3622
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:23,400
They were just road testing it like 
this.

3623
02:49:23,440 --> 02:49:27,240
Or I read it as if they're just like,
they're just seeing if this would work.

3624
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:28,870
Like testing,
huh?

3625
02:49:30,880 --> 02:49:32,330
Well It makes sense.
Yeah.

3626
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:34,900
I mean it makes sense to have something 
like that,

3627
02:49:34,901 --> 02:49:37,760
but if people can judge whether or not 
they.

3628
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:40,240
Like if something's on sale,
if it's a car,

3629
02:49:40,241 --> 02:49:45,241
it's one thing if a guy's hitting the 
brakes and turn the wheel and all that 

3630
02:49:45,241 --> 02:49:45,241
stuff,
it's one thing.

3631
02:49:45,241 --> 02:49:49,231
Or if a bus same kind of thing,
but as soon as people interact with 

3632
02:49:49,231 --> 02:49:53,611
trains,
I have a problem with that because like 

3633
02:49:53,611 --> 02:49:56,790
one of them is like super steady and 
static or move to the same sort of 

3634
02:49:56,790 --> 02:49:58,210
speeds and it's not.
It doesn't vary.

3635
02:49:58,211 --> 02:50:03,211
That was hit the brakes and do a bunch 
of things that people have cars do and 

3636
02:50:03,211 --> 02:50:04,300
the other one does.
So the one that does the one that's real

3637
02:50:04,301 --> 02:50:07,450
mobile,
the person driven car is going to figure

3638
02:50:07,451 --> 02:50:10,840
out how to time that train.
They got to take some chances if they're

3639
02:50:10,841 --> 02:50:15,841
all running through the same road 
together and they're cutting each other 

3640
02:50:15,841 --> 02:50:18,541
off and yeah,
there's gonna be some asshole doesn't 

3641
02:50:18,541 --> 02:50:19,480
seem like it's to work as good people 
are going to tax.

3642
02:50:19,481 --> 02:50:22,480
They're going to slam into that thing.
It's just weird.

3643
02:50:22,790 --> 02:50:24,670
Can have a train in the car in the same 
place.

3644
02:50:25,410 --> 02:50:27,970
It seems about as real as hyperloop 
maybe is right now.

3645
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:28,460
Which.

3646
02:50:28,840 --> 02:50:30,600
Yeah,
well that's sort of real.

3647
02:50:30,601 --> 02:50:34,390
At least everything that is real now.
It was a whisper at one time,

3648
02:50:34,420 --> 02:50:39,420
so I.
Hyperloop is real in the sense that no 

3649
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:39,420
one's written on it yet,
but that is,

3650
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:40,800
that's moving.
There's,

3651
02:50:40,810 --> 02:50:42,520
there's movement in that direction.
There's,

3652
02:50:42,910 --> 02:50:46,480
there's concepts,
there's engineers working,

3653
02:50:46,481 --> 02:50:51,481
there's design,
there's all sorts of different people 

3654
02:50:51,481 --> 02:50:51,670
involved in technology.
They're beIng consulted.

3655
02:50:51,671 --> 02:50:56,671
They're trying to figure out how to make
that actually come to light so that it 

3656
02:50:56,671 --> 02:50:56,671
is a real.
it's just,

3657
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:58,960
it's a.
It's in the embryonic stages.

3658
02:50:59,710 --> 02:51:01,270
That fucking thing is going to happen,
man.

3659
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:04,010
We're going to be able to jet across the
whole country and like an hour.

3660
02:51:05,950 --> 02:51:06,910
No.
That's going to feel like,

3661
02:51:06,911 --> 02:51:08,370
dude,
I'm going to shit my pants.

3662
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:14,320
Shit.
My pants was going to go on a regular 

3663
02:51:14,320 --> 02:51:14,320
plane goes,
what?

3664
02:51:14,320 --> 02:51:14,740
Five hundred miles an hour.
Sure.

3665
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:17,370
Okay,
let's go 200 mIles an hour.

3666
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:23,160
So you get to the other side of the 
country in an hour and a half and he 

3667
02:51:24,341 --> 02:51:29,020
just pinned to your seat.
Try to get up to go to the bathroom.

3668
02:51:29,021 --> 02:51:30,730
It's like,
good luck,

3669
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:32,350
dear crosses.
It derails.

3670
02:51:32,530 --> 02:51:34,900
Boom.
Flying the deer crosses it.

3671
02:51:34,901 --> 02:51:36,880
The front end of it is built like a 
sword.

3672
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:38,950
Yeah,
just slices through the deer.

3673
02:51:39,340 --> 02:51:44,340
That's what they should have.
They should have like the front of the 

3674
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:47,260
thing should be like,
like you know those things that you.

3675
02:51:47,261 --> 02:51:52,261
WHen you cut an onion,
you drop it down like slice or like an 

3676
02:51:52,261 --> 02:51:52,261
egg,
like a hard boiled egg.

3677
02:51:52,670 --> 02:51:54,520
You know those things?
Slice slicer.

3678
02:51:54,580 --> 02:51:57,220
That's what the front of the train 
should be.

3679
02:51:57,430 --> 02:52:01,970
It should be razor sharp swords that if 
you're so retarded,

3680
02:52:01,971 --> 02:52:06,971
do you want to step out or you want to 
push your cow in front of the just to 

3681
02:52:06,971 --> 02:52:06,971
make a youtube video.

3682
02:52:06,971 --> 02:52:11,670
It just gets exploded instantaneously.
Just gets sliced through and turned to 

3683
02:52:11,670 --> 02:52:15,511
mush.
They pretty much have that are already 

3684
02:52:15,511 --> 02:52:16,750
in the design when it's usually like a v
or illuminati triangle,

3685
02:52:16,751 --> 02:52:19,890
you know,
which brings us back to that cop shoot,

3686
02:52:19,910 --> 02:52:23,200
that deer,
that deer got eaten by a bunch of hungry

3687
02:52:23,201 --> 02:52:28,201
people,
sit nearly as much of a problem that 

3688
02:52:28,201 --> 02:52:29,640
you're going to say the deers and the 
illuminati that that new aluminum,

3689
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:32,800
the deer,
the deer.

3690
02:52:32,830 --> 02:52:37,060
What the deere wants to do is stop the 
white christian from profile.

3691
02:52:37,140 --> 02:52:42,140
That's why dear exist in mostly 
primarily white christian towns.

3692
02:52:43,030 --> 02:52:46,060
Go to brooklyn.
Find yourself a dear.

3693
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:48,850
Good luck.
Good luck.

3694
02:52:49,330 --> 02:52:53,770
Go by canter's deli and la st louis and 
find yourself a dear.

3695
02:52:54,250 --> 02:52:57,280
Good luck.
Will you find jews.

3696
02:52:57,281 --> 02:53:02,281
You do not find deer juice,
but where you find good christian folk 

3697
02:53:03,971 --> 02:53:08,971
that the jews have made sure that dare 
grow takeover and suicide bombing your 

3698
02:53:10,961 --> 02:53:13,420
automobile of.
You're fine with that.

3699
02:53:13,630 --> 02:53:18,630
That's only you but me.
I want to mad max bumper from mad max.

3700
02:53:22,120 --> 02:53:27,120
When you go to places like South Dakota,
any of those places where there's a lot 

3701
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:28,050
of deer,
I think do.

3702
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:31,100
Would you say Michigan is the worst?
You say?

3703
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:36,120
Michigan.
We went over the country like how many 

3704
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:38,881
different people get in car accidents 
with deer every year,

3705
02:53:39,431 --> 02:53:44,431
and I think Michigan was fucking insane.
Like more than a hundred thousand people

3706
02:53:44,940 --> 02:53:49,480
get in car accidents a year with deer.
Well,

3707
02:53:49,540 --> 02:53:51,130
to Be honest,
alabama's the worst.

3708
02:53:51,690 --> 02:53:52,660
What is that?
What are they at?

3709
02:53:52,930 --> 02:53:57,930
One and 127.
One in 100.

3710
02:53:58,961 --> 02:54:02,020
20 seven car accidents involve the deer 
chance of collision.

3711
02:54:02,021 --> 02:54:03,520
It says with,
oh my god,

3712
02:54:03,521 --> 02:54:05,320
that's a one percent chance.
Essentially.

3713
02:54:05,710 --> 02:54:10,710
That's like if you drive 100 times,
one time we got to kick fucking crazy.

3714
02:54:11,190 --> 02:54:15,650
That is if you drive 100 times,
how many times did you have 100 jobs?

3715
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:16,530
Michigan's a little.
Oh,

3716
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:19,150
there's a couple of.
Mississippi is the highest.

3717
02:54:19,450 --> 02:54:21,940
Michigan is one in 94.
Wow.

3718
02:54:22,150 --> 02:54:27,150
Minnesota times,
but it doesn't matter if there's a deer 

3719
02:54:27,150 --> 02:54:27,220
in the road.
Why does that,

3720
02:54:27,221 --> 02:54:27,970
dan,
rather than fuck it,

3721
02:54:27,971 --> 02:54:29,080
bro.
Hippies.

3722
02:54:29,081 --> 02:54:31,280
One in 84.
Oh my god.

3723
02:54:31,281 --> 02:54:35,040
And montana's one in one 75 
Pennsylvania,

3724
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:37,480
one in 71.
And then the top one,

3725
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:42,540
I was in Montana recently,
every fucking person up there has a 

3726
02:54:42,540 --> 02:54:44,230
battering ram welded to the front of 
their truck.

3727
02:54:44,620 --> 02:54:47,740
Everyone one in 39.
Oh my god.

3728
02:54:48,310 --> 02:54:50,080
Oh my god,
I wasn't.

3729
02:54:50,770 --> 02:54:51,280
Sorry,
go ahead.

3730
02:54:51,370 --> 02:54:56,370
I was in Michigan like a year ago and we
drove down to do shows in like Michigan 

3731
02:54:56,370 --> 02:54:56,950
to columbus,
Ohio to whatever.

3732
02:54:57,220 --> 02:55:02,220
But the drive from Michigan to columbus,
there was so many dead deer on the side 

3733
02:55:02,220 --> 02:55:03,770
of the road,
like every half mile there was just dead

3734
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:07,700
bodies and in blood it was just guts and
blood and deer everywhere.

3735
02:55:07,701 --> 02:55:10,520
It was really disgusting how many deer 
deer there were.

3736
02:55:10,620 --> 02:55:12,710
There's a lot.
And there's rules and whether or not you

3737
02:55:12,711 --> 02:55:17,711
can eat it like a.
If you get there like right after the 

3738
02:55:17,711 --> 02:55:20,711
accident,
I think you can call the cops and some 

3739
02:55:20,711 --> 02:55:21,440
states and they'll let you take the deer
home and eat it.

3740
02:55:21,800 --> 02:55:23,810
Which is nice.
I mean if somebody leaves it behind,

3741
02:55:23,870 --> 02:55:28,870
look,
if you're a person that's poor and you 

3742
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:28,870
run across a deer that just got hit by a
car,

3743
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:33,260
that's like a hundred pounds of meat.
That's like 100 meals,

3744
02:55:33,470 --> 02:55:35,870
you know what I mean?
That's amazing for your family,

3745
02:55:35,871 --> 02:55:40,871
you know you can all.
So there's a lot of people that get 

3746
02:55:40,871 --> 02:55:42,290
excited about roadkill,
but the real problem is it kills.

3747
02:55:42,710 --> 02:55:46,400
I think he kills 200 people a year in 
this country.

3748
02:55:46,430 --> 02:55:51,430
Is that the number?
I think it's 200 people a year in this 

3749
02:55:51,430 --> 02:55:55,001
country alone.
Die from collisions with deere 200 times

3750
02:55:55,521 --> 02:55:57,080
more than we'd.
Well it's two.

3751
02:55:57,081 --> 02:56:02,081
It's 2 million car accidents or one 
point 5 million car accidents in this 

3752
02:56:02,081 --> 02:56:05,210
country every year with dear one point 5
million.

3753
02:56:05,600 --> 02:56:08,210
And I think the number of people that 
dies like 200.

3754
02:56:08,510 --> 02:56:12,050
Does that make sense?
But either way.

3755
02:56:12,290 --> 02:56:15,090
One point 5 million on 100 percent sure 
of that.

3756
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:17,630
It says leads to about 200 human deaths 
in one point.

3757
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:19,830
$1,000,000,000
in property damage.

3758
02:56:20,190 --> 02:56:23,450
Seen them property damage thing.
So what about the deer's life?

3759
02:56:23,570 --> 02:56:25,610
Because that not worth money.
You son of a bitch.

3760
02:56:25,920 --> 02:56:27,710
Oh,
you put money on life.

3761
02:56:28,970 --> 02:56:33,440
I'm a killer.
I turned into a werewolf that bear video

3762
02:56:33,870 --> 02:56:35,960
I think you posted the other day.
Oh yeah.

3763
02:56:36,180 --> 02:56:37,910
That's so fucked up.
Not good.

3764
02:56:39,410 --> 02:56:41,060
That makes me want to buy a gun just for
that.

3765
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:45,770
Not good.
There's a lot of not good lately.

3766
02:56:45,900 --> 02:56:50,900
What did you see?
The mountain lion one for the mountain 

3767
02:56:50,900 --> 02:56:53,201
lion was falling.
The guy around trying to figure out 

3768
02:56:53,201 --> 02:56:53,201
whether or not it should jack.
I'm so not good.

3769
02:56:53,201 --> 02:56:58,030
Big ass old cat.
It's a big fucking cat and it's looking 

3770
02:56:58,030 --> 02:56:58,880
at them.
I don't know if it's an old cat,

3771
02:56:58,881 --> 02:57:00,590
but I mean it's.
It's a mature cat.

3772
02:57:00,780 --> 02:57:02,210
Big cat.
Did he do it?

3773
02:57:02,211 --> 02:57:07,211
He should have done and that sits like 
you kind of walked away and I thought 

3774
02:57:07,211 --> 02:57:08,150
you're not supposed to.
You're not supposed to walk back,

3775
02:57:08,151 --> 02:57:10,340
but you have to be careful and 
challenging it.

3776
02:57:10,341 --> 02:57:13,160
You're not supposed to look at it in the
eyes because it might.

3777
02:57:13,430 --> 02:57:18,430
It might instill a primal rage in that 
fucking murderers predator where it just

3778
02:57:19,041 --> 02:57:23,240
decides to fuck you up.
It's hard to say what you're supposed to

3779
02:57:23,241 --> 02:57:28,241
do and what you're not supposed to do 
because I've heard people say that you 

3780
02:57:28,241 --> 02:57:30,530
should talk loud and I've heard people 
say that you should just walk away,

3781
02:57:30,830 --> 02:57:32,030
jiggle your car keys.

3782
02:57:32,300 --> 02:57:32,740
Yeah.
I mean,

3783
02:57:32,830 --> 02:57:37,830
I don't think you can predict.
Just like you can't predict like a 

3784
02:57:37,830 --> 02:57:40,430
regular cat.
You'll get how many people have 

3785
02:57:40,430 --> 02:57:43,091
different kinds of cats,
like you have different cats that I 

3786
02:57:43,091 --> 02:57:45,731
have.
We all have different cats and I've had 

3787
02:57:45,731 --> 02:57:45,890
a bunch of the same kind of cats.
They behave different.

3788
02:57:47,400 --> 02:57:50,000
They just all fucking animals are 
different,

3789
02:57:50,001 --> 02:57:55,001
man.
You can run across one wolf that wants 

3790
02:57:55,001 --> 02:57:57,431
to fuck you up and you could walk.
Well you can come across another wolf 

3791
02:57:57,431 --> 02:58:01,601
that doesn't want to have anything to do
with you and wants to stay in the 

3792
02:58:01,601 --> 02:58:04,061
background and move away from you.
So it's entirely possible that this guy 

3793
02:58:04,061 --> 02:58:07,050
just ran across a cat that was thinking 
about eating a person.

3794
02:58:07,490 --> 02:58:10,830
What would he have been able to kill 
this and had been okay.

3795
02:58:11,260 --> 02:58:12,100
Like,
oh man.

3796
02:58:12,700 --> 02:58:13,840
Self defense.
Yeah.

3797
02:58:14,160 --> 02:58:15,150
Yeah.
If he had a weapon,

3798
02:58:15,151 --> 02:58:17,670
but I don't think he had a weapon.
I don't think he had anything like this.

3799
02:58:17,671 --> 02:58:18,420
This isn't.
Okay.

3800
02:58:18,421 --> 02:58:19,940
You couldn't have just killed it because
it's near them.

3801
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:25,680
You would have to make a judgment call 
and you'd have to be able to support 

3802
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:26,040
that judgment call.
Like if someone was out there,

3803
02:58:26,041 --> 02:58:28,200
right?
So if you were a bow hunter and you have

3804
02:58:28,201 --> 02:58:33,201
an a stare down with this mountain lion,
you have to be absolutely sure that 

3805
02:58:33,201 --> 02:58:33,990
you've exhausted.
Yeah,

3806
02:58:34,010 --> 02:58:37,280
all of the possibilities.
But there's a fine line,

3807
02:58:37,310 --> 02:58:39,830
right?
Is like you want to,

3808
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:41,480
you want to be able to preserve your own
life.

3809
02:58:41,750 --> 02:58:45,810
You want to make sure that you're okay,
but you also want to you,

3810
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:48,620
if you're going to kill this thing,
you want to be right about it.

3811
02:58:49,040 --> 02:58:52,250
So you have to figure out what is that.
When you may hit that switch.

3812
02:58:52,580 --> 02:58:56,570
So do you hold onto the arrow and you 
hold your bone front of that cat.

3813
02:58:56,900 --> 02:58:59,420
Like right there.
I gotta be honest with you.

3814
02:58:59,960 --> 02:59:04,960
I might shoot that fucking cat.
The cat is 15 feet away from him and 

3815
02:59:04,960 --> 02:59:08,981
this guy got away with it,
but he didn't have to and now the cat's 

3816
02:59:08,981 --> 02:59:11,111
moving in on him at 15 feet away.
The problem is once this thing jumps on 

3817
02:59:11,271 --> 02:59:13,520
you,
you don't have a fucking chance.

3818
02:59:13,521 --> 02:59:17,060
And once it realizes how weak you really
are because you look way bigger than it,

3819
02:59:17,090 --> 02:59:18,380
you're standing like right there.

3820
02:59:18,440 --> 02:59:20,590
That cat's dead right there.
Broadside.

3821
02:59:21,270 --> 02:59:26,270
That's 15 feet away from.
I'm drawn an arrow back and I'm getting 

3822
02:59:26,270 --> 02:59:26,780
rid of that cat.
I can't take that chance.

3823
02:59:26,781 --> 02:59:31,781
I'm not going to die.
I'm not going to die because I don't 

3824
02:59:31,781 --> 02:59:31,781
want it to die.
I don't want to kill it,

3825
02:59:31,781 --> 02:59:34,640
but I don't want it to kill me for sure.
And this is an animal that is absolutely

3826
02:59:34,641 --> 02:59:37,370
stocking a person.
It's trying to figure out whether or not

3827
02:59:37,371 --> 02:59:38,510
it can do it.
Now,

3828
02:59:38,511 --> 02:59:40,400
in this guy's case,
he got lucky.

3829
02:59:40,490 --> 02:59:43,340
He talked enough.
He maybe he was a bigger guy.

3830
02:59:43,940 --> 02:59:46,100
Maybe the cat just didn't feel like it 
was worth it.

3831
02:59:46,470 --> 02:59:48,380
I'd been throwing rocks.
Maybe.

3832
02:59:48,440 --> 02:59:50,950
Maybe the rocks would make it charge.
If you don't know,

3833
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:52,040
man,
you don't know.

3834
02:59:52,041 --> 02:59:54,440
That's the problem.
If someone can tell you if,

3835
02:59:54,450 --> 02:59:54,970
uh,
the,

3836
02:59:55,020 --> 02:59:58,310
the general rule of thumb is if a bear 
attacks you play dead.

3837
02:59:58,940 --> 03:00:00,980
But if a cougar attacks you fight back.

3838
03:00:01,070 --> 03:00:03,440
Where was this app by the way?
I think he was on his bike so he had his

3839
03:00:03,441 --> 03:00:05,510
bike in between them.
So maybe that's good.

3840
03:00:05,511 --> 03:00:06,800
Use it as like a little shield or 
something.

3841
03:00:06,830 --> 03:00:08,420
Fuck yeah,
I'd be taking those tires off.

3842
03:00:08,421 --> 03:00:12,650
I'd beat that fucking thing to death.
I'd be scared as fuck right here to.

3843
03:00:12,950 --> 03:00:14,660
This guy is so cool about this.

3844
03:00:15,490 --> 03:00:20,490
Unbelievable.
There's a mountain lion right here.

3845
03:00:26,060 --> 03:00:27,650
I mean folks were free.
People listening.

3846
03:00:27,651 --> 03:00:32,651
It's on a trail.
This thing is 15 feet in front of them 

3847
03:00:32,651 --> 03:00:32,810
right in front of me.
Oh yeah.

3848
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:34,580
Oh yeah.
That's 15 feet in front of him,

3849
03:00:34,581 --> 03:00:36,620
right?
I mean maybe 20.

3850
03:00:36,750 --> 03:00:41,750
And he says this helmet on.
Whatever that thing's bite your face 

3851
03:00:41,750 --> 03:00:44,681
off.
This is a nice time to own a gun.

3852
03:00:45,590 --> 03:00:47,180
Right here is nice.
You go,

3853
03:00:48,080 --> 03:00:48,950
hey man.
Hey man.

3854
03:00:49,100 --> 03:00:50,600
Check this out.
Boom.

3855
03:00:51,410 --> 03:00:56,410
Fuck you.
I don't know what I would've done if I 

3856
03:00:56,410 --> 03:00:56,410
was.
If you have a gun,

3857
03:00:56,410 --> 03:00:56,840
you shoot it the ground.
You just just go,

3858
03:00:56,870 --> 03:00:57,740
bitch.
Oh,

3859
03:00:57,741 --> 03:01:00,370
he's moving towards it.
It's cute.

3860
03:01:01,070 --> 03:01:02,410
I might say to you,
I might.

3861
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:04,000
He's backing up.
I might.

3862
03:01:05,770 --> 03:01:07,810
I might go crazy and see if I could 
scare them off here.

3863
03:01:07,900 --> 03:01:10,360
That's probably what I would be doing.
I'd be screaming at it more.

3864
03:01:10,410 --> 03:01:11,440
Be dead.
Yeah,

3865
03:01:11,441 --> 03:01:12,520
most likely.
Let's be honest.

3866
03:01:12,521 --> 03:01:14,410
He'd be wheezing.
Delicious.

3867
03:01:14,430 --> 03:01:16,080
You lit a cigarette up.
Maybe he'd run away.

3868
03:01:16,120 --> 03:01:21,120
Yeah,
I would use fire cigarette smoking 

3869
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:21,120
house.
I would probably do that.

3870
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:25,121
I'd probably like if I had my lighter 
and light my shirt on fire or something 

3871
03:01:25,121 --> 03:01:28,291
like that.
There was an old man in Canada just a 

3872
03:01:28,291 --> 03:01:28,291
couple of years ago,
killed one with a knife.

3873
03:01:28,291 --> 03:01:29,950
He got attacked by a mountain lion and 
you're 60 years old.

3874
03:01:29,951 --> 03:01:34,951
He's fighting off and cut its neck 
fighting to the death with a monster

3875
03:01:38,720 --> 03:01:40,640
jumps out clause.
A hold of them.

3876
03:01:41,390 --> 03:01:46,390
Yeah.
I think mountain lions for just for the 

3877
03:01:46,390 --> 03:01:49,691
record.
I think mountain lions are fucking 

3878
03:01:49,691 --> 03:01:49,691
awesome.
I'm a big fan of mountain lions.

3879
03:01:49,691 --> 03:01:51,050
There's a lot of the people that are 
animal rights activists,

3880
03:01:51,051 --> 03:01:53,650
they might hear this and say,
what about the person?

3881
03:01:53,900 --> 03:01:57,620
The person shouldn't be there.
That's the lion's home.

3882
03:01:57,900 --> 03:02:02,150
A persons in the lion's home.
Let's be honest folks.

3883
03:02:02,330 --> 03:02:05,900
There's people that are beautiful.
They produced poetry,

3884
03:02:05,930 --> 03:02:08,540
they write songs,
they make movies,

3885
03:02:08,541 --> 03:02:11,000
they love you.
They take you out to dinner,

3886
03:02:11,001 --> 03:02:12,680
they're your friend.
You can count on them.

3887
03:02:12,681 --> 03:02:17,681
They offer emotional support.
Mountain lions don't give you any of 

3888
03:02:17,681 --> 03:02:17,681
that shit.
So when it comes,

3889
03:02:17,681 --> 03:02:19,130
when it comes to.
I know why I said poetry,

3890
03:02:19,131 --> 03:02:21,110
I believe I agree with everything I said
up to poetry,

3891
03:02:22,100 --> 03:02:24,950
but it comes to who do I like more?
Mountain lion or that guy on the bike.

3892
03:02:25,550 --> 03:02:27,080
I don't even know that guy on the bike.
I love him.

3893
03:02:27,590 --> 03:02:29,000
Give him a hug.
I shoot that fucking thing.

3894
03:02:29,001 --> 03:02:31,850
If I was nearby creepy ass predator cat,

3895
03:02:32,970 --> 03:02:34,950
it would be cool to have a full 
simulation.

3896
03:02:35,010 --> 03:02:35,940
Like you can be like,
all right,

3897
03:02:35,941 --> 03:02:38,930
I'm going to see what happens if I went 
up to it as if it was a normal cat,

3898
03:02:39,100 --> 03:02:44,100
like kind of like grizzly man style.
You just see red screen.

3899
03:02:44,740 --> 03:02:46,890
Yeah,
but if you could try everything.

3900
03:02:46,940 --> 03:02:48,830
Like now I'm ready.
Tried through mushu.

3901
03:02:48,930 --> 03:02:53,930
It'd be like a lawnmower.
Hit your face spray all over the screen.

3902
03:02:56,010 --> 03:03:01,010
I just wonder like if there was like 
that kind of calming approach or 

3903
03:03:01,011 --> 03:03:01,630
anything.
No,

3904
03:03:01,950 --> 03:03:02,670
no,
no.

3905
03:03:02,671 --> 03:03:07,380
What are you the grizzly man?
Hey mr.

3906
03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:11,760
It's going to be okay.
He must just chocolate.

3907
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:14,030
I remember there's a scene,
the grizzly man where uh,

3908
03:03:14,040 --> 03:03:17,900
the bear took a shit and he's like,
this came out of this.

3909
03:03:18,030 --> 03:03:22,890
Came out of her butt touching.
I feel like I'm touching inside of her.

3910
03:03:23,240 --> 03:03:26,430
Came out of her,
but I get his hands on bear shit.

3911
03:03:26,550 --> 03:03:28,590
I wish there could be a sequel to that 
movie so bad.

3912
03:03:28,591 --> 03:03:30,840
Like bob ross could plAy it.
Or here's the thing.

3913
03:03:30,940 --> 03:03:31,000
It

3914
03:03:31,010 --> 03:03:36,010
wasn't a sequel,
but that guy made I think more than a 

3915
03:03:37,300 --> 03:03:39,640
hundred hours of footage.
He had a,

3916
03:03:39,641 --> 03:03:44,641
an entire show that they did on one of 
the reality tv channels were.

3917
03:03:45,311 --> 03:03:50,311
It was a grizzly man show where it was 
like they edited a lot of his last 

3918
03:03:50,311 --> 03:03:53,770
footage and it was really fascinating 
because as misguided as this guy was who

3919
03:03:53,771 --> 03:03:57,190
was definitely misguided and he 
definitely had some issues for sure.

3920
03:03:57,350 --> 03:03:57,980
He really

3921
03:03:57,980 --> 03:04:02,980
did love bears and he was really 
passionate about bears and he was 

3922
03:04:02,980 --> 03:04:06,791
passionate about describing various 
aspects of their behavior and it was 

3923
03:04:06,791 --> 03:04:10,220
really interesting and he got some 
fucking bad ass footage,

3924
03:04:10,221 --> 03:04:15,221
man.
He got some incredible footage like 

3925
03:04:15,221 --> 03:04:15,221
really close up footage of bears 
fighting.

3926
03:04:15,221 --> 03:04:19,870
He got footage of bears coming right up 
to him and say like literally sniffing 

3927
03:04:19,870 --> 03:04:23,051
his hand and running away.
He got footage of wild fox is becoming 

3928
03:04:23,051 --> 03:04:27,161
his friend,
like hanging around his camp and he 

3929
03:04:27,161 --> 03:04:27,161
would feed them and hang out with them.
They'd steal his hat.

3930
03:04:27,161 --> 03:04:31,510
He got amazing footage,
so if you look at the guy's just like a 

3931
03:04:31,510 --> 03:04:32,810
wildlife photographer,
uk,

3932
03:04:32,811 --> 03:04:37,811
he's like one of the greatest of all 
time in a way because what he did was 

3933
03:04:37,881 --> 03:04:41,750
something that nobody was willing to do.
Go full screen on this motherfucker.

3934
03:04:42,860 --> 03:04:44,540
Can't put this on youtube.
Right.

3935
03:04:44,540 --> 03:04:45,290
Of course,
of course.

3936
03:04:45,291 --> 03:04:46,100
Of course,
of course,

3937
03:04:46,610 --> 03:04:47,440
this is,
um,

3938
03:04:47,540 --> 03:04:49,490
if you haven't seen this,
this is two bears.

3939
03:04:49,491 --> 03:04:54,491
I think we did commentary on this during
the ice house chronicles because I was 

3940
03:04:54,491 --> 03:04:54,491
talking about jitsu.
I was like,

3941
03:04:54,491 --> 03:04:57,050
he's got very good jujitsu.
like the way the big bear on top,

3942
03:04:57,051 --> 03:04:59,420
it's passing.
The other guy on the bottom is trying to

3943
03:04:59,421 --> 03:05:01,250
work the guard.
He's putting feet on the hips,

3944
03:05:01,400 --> 03:05:06,370
but the big bears using pressure.
He's like a old school like sallow.

3945
03:05:06,371 --> 03:05:10,850
He barrow like fucking rock solid 
jujitsu.

3946
03:05:10,880 --> 03:05:13,340
Like this is what I'm looking at here.
And pooping,

3947
03:05:13,670 --> 03:05:14,300
he's,
oh yeah,

3948
03:05:14,301 --> 03:05:16,310
they shit the shit while they're going 
to war.

3949
03:05:16,460 --> 03:05:20,420
But this is very much like jujitsu in a 
lot of ways.

3950
03:05:20,421 --> 03:05:20,710
Man,
I'm.

3951
03:05:20,711 --> 03:05:22,040
When I'm,
when I'm watching this,

3952
03:05:22,550 --> 03:05:26,360
this is,
this is like rafael lovato.

3953
03:05:26,600 --> 03:05:29,840
This is that kind of jujitsu,
like super strong,

3954
03:05:29,841 --> 03:05:33,680
real technical pressure power to get on 
top of you.

3955
03:05:33,680 --> 03:05:36,080
And they put the fucking clamped down on
you and you're dead.

3956
03:05:36,610 --> 03:05:38,060
Like this.
Bear is kind of doing that.

3957
03:05:38,090 --> 03:05:39,920
But the bottom bear got up.
Look at this.

3958
03:05:40,010 --> 03:05:41,660
He's game.
He's not as big,

3959
03:05:42,110 --> 03:05:45,080
but he's game.
They go to war,

3960
03:05:45,081 --> 03:05:47,300
the guy on the left is considerably 
smaller if you see it,

3961
03:05:47,360 --> 03:05:52,360
you see how much smaller is like the one
on the right is like literally like 25 

3962
03:05:52,360 --> 03:05:56,321
percent larger,
but the guy in the bottom is not given 

3963
03:05:56,321 --> 03:05:56,321
up.
It's like marcello garcia,

3964
03:05:56,321 --> 03:06:00,671
rico rodriguez,
you motherfuckers don't even know she 

3965
03:06:00,671 --> 03:06:03,561
steps training.
You see that video of a wrestler versus 

3966
03:06:03,561 --> 03:06:04,910
a bodybuilder and like the same kind of 
thing where the bodybuilders.

3967
03:06:05,420 --> 03:06:07,600
Super huge and you're like wrestling for
somebody.

3968
03:06:07,870 --> 03:06:12,870
there's a jujitsu.
When is pedro sAuer versus a 

3969
03:06:12,870 --> 03:06:12,870
bodybuilder?
I'll maybe that's it.

3970
03:06:12,870 --> 03:06:16,720
Well pedro sauer I think.
Look up this pedro sauer s a u e r 

3971
03:06:17,330 --> 03:06:21,830
versus I'm a bodybuilder and I think the
dude was like,

3972
03:06:21,831 --> 03:06:25,040
I want to say it was like 240 pounds and
pedro sauer was like 1:50

3973
03:06:25,520 --> 03:06:30,520
and he got in this like street fight 
with this guy in a gym and this is back 

3974
03:06:30,520 --> 03:06:32,780
in the day when like the gracie 
challenges were going on.

3975
03:06:32,780 --> 03:06:36,170
She'll like that.
This is the guy he's fucking jacked.

3976
03:06:36,680 --> 03:06:40,430
And pedro sauer I believe is hixon 
gracie linneage.

3977
03:06:40,431 --> 03:06:42,350
I apologize if I'm Wrong,
but either way,

3978
03:06:42,351 --> 03:06:45,220
he's a super respected.
I know he's great.

3979
03:06:45,230 --> 03:06:50,230
He's got a gracie ngayon,
super respected jujitsu instructor and 

3980
03:06:50,230 --> 03:06:54,191
competitor,
so he's got this giant Bodybuilder in 

3981
03:06:54,191 --> 03:06:54,560
front of him and he's like side kicking 
him in the thigh.

3982
03:06:54,680 --> 03:06:56,040
This is so old school.
I

3983
03:06:56,040 --> 03:07:01,040
wish I knew what year this was,
but he keeps hitting him with his front 

3984
03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:03,150
legs because even thought he's way small
than this guy and the bodybuilder yet to

3985
03:07:03,151 --> 03:07:08,151
move.
Now he tries to make his move and he 

3986
03:07:08,151 --> 03:07:09,831
throws a punch,
but it didn't work in and pedro sauer 

3987
03:07:09,831 --> 03:07:10,770
starts jacking him with punches and so 
the guy takes him down.

3988
03:07:10,950 --> 03:07:14,250
So now when the guy takes him down,
pedro sauer immediately sweeps him,

3989
03:07:14,580 --> 03:07:19,580
mounts on them,
and that the dude rolled him over at 

3990
03:07:19,580 --> 03:07:20,190
least one time,
but pedro didn't really take any damage.

3991
03:07:20,191 --> 03:07:25,191
You see how good like a real legit 
brazilian jujitsu practitioner is at 

3992
03:07:26,341 --> 03:07:31,341
protecting himself,
and then especially the fact that he's 

3993
03:07:31,341 --> 03:07:33,501
wearing a gi,
which is even better because he can 

3994
03:07:33,501 --> 03:07:33,501
really.
Even though the other guy is,

3995
03:07:33,501 --> 03:07:35,040
he's bare chested,
if pedro's we're an aggie,

3996
03:07:35,250 --> 03:07:37,830
he can control the guy because it's all,
it's grippy,

3997
03:07:38,080 --> 03:07:43,080
you know,
the allows you to hold onto a big 

3998
03:07:43,080 --> 03:07:45,231
fucking sweaty gorilla like this guy.
So he eventually catches homeboy in an 

3999
03:07:45,231 --> 03:07:46,770
arm bar.
It's not the same video I saw it,

4000
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:49,190
but it's just pretty much idea.
Yeah.

4001
03:07:49,500 --> 03:07:51,540
I want to say this was like 95 or 
something like that.

4002
03:07:52,350 --> 03:07:55,170
So he's holding onto the dude.
What does it say?

4003
03:07:56,530 --> 03:07:59,530
what does it say?
That guy was 92,

4004
03:07:59,531 --> 03:08:04,531
mr Utah.
So I thought I thought it was in 

4005
03:08:04,531 --> 03:08:04,531
[inaudible] 92.
Well,

4006
03:08:04,531 --> 03:08:04,600
pedro sauer.
I think he's in Utah.

4007
03:08:04,601 --> 03:08:08,200
I think he's a salt lake city guy.
I'm pretty sure I might be wrong,

4008
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:10,570
but in either way,
pedro sauer,

4009
03:08:10,571 --> 03:08:15,571
super respected,
very a very high level jujitsu 

4010
03:08:15,571 --> 03:08:15,571
instructor.
A lot of blood here.

4011
03:08:15,571 --> 03:08:17,290
Man.
Who's got the blood?

4012
03:08:17,870 --> 03:08:18,760
Look at that.
Oh shit.

4013
03:08:18,761 --> 03:08:21,760
Armbar son.
I think he.

4014
03:08:21,880 --> 03:08:25,510
He made that dude's fucking nose explode
before your arm barred him.

4015
03:08:27,710 --> 03:08:29,510
Is that guys face a bloody mess?

4016
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:31,390
Really?

4017
03:08:31,900 --> 03:08:32,650
Yeah.
Yeah,

4018
03:08:32,651 --> 03:08:34,000
there It is.
That's the blood.

4019
03:08:34,090 --> 03:08:36,070
Yeah.
He punched him in the nose and choke the

4020
03:08:36,071 --> 03:08:37,900
shit out of him and then took his.
Took his arm,

4021
03:08:38,480 --> 03:08:42,160
old school son,
but the difference in strength and size,

4022
03:08:42,220 --> 03:08:45,070
pretty substantial.
what did you say?

4023
03:08:45,580 --> 03:08:50,580
Mine was obviously one of those facebook
videos I guess who wins when you 

4024
03:08:50,580 --> 03:08:54,850
progress wrestler versus a bodybuilder 
in the bodybuilder was just this huge 

4025
03:08:54,850 --> 03:08:57,520
monster bodybuilder and the rest are 
just had no problem.

4026
03:08:57,521 --> 03:08:59,530
Just throwing them on the ground 
constantly.

4027
03:08:59,620 --> 03:09:04,620
Just it was just wrestling.
I was an mma but it wasn't a pro 

4028
03:09:04,620 --> 03:09:04,620
wrestler.
You said progress or was it just like.

4029
03:09:04,620 --> 03:09:05,340
Just like.
no,

4030
03:09:05,400 --> 03:09:07,540
no,
like I'm not a progress wrestler.

4031
03:09:07,541 --> 03:09:09,610
Like a professional wrestler.
Like s like oh,

4032
03:09:09,611 --> 03:09:11,050
like someone is an expert.
Expert.

4033
03:09:11,710 --> 03:09:12,370
Expert.
Yeah.

4034
03:09:13,420 --> 03:09:16,660
Progress was used to be real wrestlers,
like not that they're not now.

4035
03:09:16,690 --> 03:09:19,180
Now they're more real entertainers,
but they can wrestle.

4036
03:09:19,181 --> 03:09:24,181
Obviously brock lesnar can wrestle,
but the original days of progressing it 

4037
03:09:24,181 --> 03:09:25,810
wasn't fake.
It is the weirdest thing.

4038
03:09:26,170 --> 03:09:30,670
That is the only sport that's a sport in
the fucking olympics,

4039
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:35,170
but in the professional world it's fake.
And when I say fake,

4040
03:09:35,260 --> 03:09:37,080
I don't mean it disrespectfully.
I know,

4041
03:09:37,140 --> 03:09:40,570
joked around about progressing a lot of 
progressing fans.

4042
03:09:40,571 --> 03:09:42,280
Got super butthurt.
Listen,

4043
03:09:42,310 --> 03:09:46,180
I absolutely respect the athletes and 
their abilities and what they're doing.

4044
03:09:46,600 --> 03:09:49,030
I like to fuck with tony hinchcliffe 
folks.

4045
03:09:49,240 --> 03:09:50,290
Okay.
It's fun.

4046
03:09:50,590 --> 03:09:54,100
He loves wrestling a little too much and
if you burned along with

4047
03:09:54,100 --> 03:09:55,330
that.
I'm so sorry,

4048
03:09:55,690 --> 03:09:58,210
but my honest feelings about pro 
wrestling as I.

4049
03:09:58,330 --> 03:10:03,330
It disturbs me that guys who are so good
and women who are so good at wrestling 

4050
03:10:04,870 --> 03:10:09,870
don't have a professional venue for it.
we're wrestling is so exciting on an 

4051
03:10:09,870 --> 03:10:13,120
amateur level.
Whereas like tennis players have massive

4052
03:10:13,121 --> 03:10:18,121
opportunities.
Everybody else has massive 

4053
03:10:18,121 --> 03:10:18,121
opportunities.
I mean,

4054
03:10:18,121 --> 03:10:21,570
I guess swimming doesn't,
but a lot of like big time sports have 

4055
03:10:21,570 --> 03:10:21,570
these huge opportunities,
but what?

4056
03:10:21,570 --> 03:10:26,371
Swimming doesn't have his amateur 
swimming and then fake swimming where 

4057
03:10:26,710 --> 03:10:28,660
they're like rolling.
He's got jello.

4058
03:10:28,780 --> 03:10:30,820
He got the job.
all ladies and gentlemen,

4059
03:10:30,821 --> 03:10:35,070
Michael Phelps says doing joe out 
tomorrow,

4060
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:40,120
renelle low and he would have elton john
sunglasses on and a fucking chuck 

4061
03:10:40,120 --> 03:10:43,981
liddell mohawk and he'd be doing the pro
wrestling version of swimming with go 

4062
03:10:44,980 --> 03:10:45,900
pro swimming.
Yeah,

4063
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:47,410
nick,
nick fucking.

4064
03:10:47,411 --> 03:10:49,930
What's his name?
The guy who runs a pro wrestling,

4065
03:10:50,440 --> 03:10:52,000
vince mcmahon,
fensick man,

4066
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:56,680
he puts a bandanna on his neck and he 
has a one of those mark spitz mustaches.

4067
03:10:56,680 --> 03:11:01,680
This is a new look,
and he just talks about pro swimming 

4068
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:02,590
for.
We're taking pro swimming the same place

4069
03:11:02,591 --> 03:11:05,060
we took pro wrestling.
Alex Jones,

4070
03:11:05,100 --> 03:11:07,060
Michael Michael Phelps is like,
fuck man.

4071
03:11:07,320 --> 03:11:08,080
You know,
uh,

4072
03:11:08,081 --> 03:11:10,570
I love wheaties as much as the next guy,
but I'm tired.

4073
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:13,120
I'm tired of just living off sponsors.
I got to watch what I do.

4074
03:11:13,121 --> 03:11:15,010
I can't smoke weed.
This is Bullshit.

4075
03:11:15,250 --> 03:11:17,230
Why don't I have a professional venue?
Hey man,

4076
03:11:17,410 --> 03:11:22,410
if,
if fucking golf is in the olympics and 

4077
03:11:22,410 --> 03:11:22,410
golfers make millions of dollars,
everybody got a damn swims,

4078
03:11:22,410 --> 03:11:24,640
you'll know how to swim.
Didn't erase your cousin when you were a

4079
03:11:24,641 --> 03:11:25,780
kid.
We all know how to swim,

4080
03:11:25,810 --> 03:11:26,440
right?
Okay,

4081
03:11:26,770 --> 03:11:28,420
let's make pro swimming.
Let's do this.

4082
03:11:28,660 --> 03:11:31,620
He gets together with vince mcmahon.
they have swimming.

4083
03:11:32,290 --> 03:11:37,290
that's good idea.
Like there's hoops that they guys don't 

4084
03:11:37,290 --> 03:11:39,520
even care like it.
Espn launches new wwe vertical.

4085
03:11:39,650 --> 03:11:39,910
What?

4086
03:11:40,070 --> 03:11:42,010
What does that mean?
Was a vertical.

4087
03:11:43,590 --> 03:11:46,660
They're going to start covering wwe or 
you hard right now.

4088
03:11:46,700 --> 03:11:47,970
No job.
You're whoa,

4089
03:11:47,990 --> 03:11:50,410
whoa.
Why would a sports thing,

4090
03:11:50,411 --> 03:11:52,270
and we decided to do that because they 
don't need money.

4091
03:11:52,390 --> 03:11:54,190
I know it's entertainment,
but like the.

4092
03:11:54,820 --> 03:11:59,710
Well apparently these shows are doing 
not so good because of the internet,

4093
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:05,280
because of the different.
like if you're talking about like where 

4094
03:12:05,280 --> 03:12:09,070
you get your news and your entertainment
and your coverage of different sports.

4095
03:12:09,490 --> 03:12:12,730
A lot of people turned to the internet.
Say if you had a studio,

4096
03:12:12,760 --> 03:12:17,760
okay,
and you had a studio in hollywood and 

4097
03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:17,760
you said,
hey,

4098
03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:18,490
you know what?
I enjoy the ufc coverage.

4099
03:12:18,790 --> 03:12:23,790
I enjoy a bella tours coverage.
I enjoy all these different mixed 

4100
03:12:23,790 --> 03:12:25,510
martial arts,
but I want to do my own new show and I'm

4101
03:12:25,511 --> 03:12:29,590
just going to put it on youtube and I'm 
going to hire dean.

4102
03:12:29,590 --> 03:12:32,850
Thomas is essentially what dana white's 
done with that.

4103
03:12:32,860 --> 03:12:35,290
Looking for a fight show.
What if someone comes along and says,

4104
03:12:35,470 --> 03:12:38,530
I'm going to do that with a cowboy 
serone some fun,

4105
03:12:38,531 --> 03:12:42,250
colorful characters and a.
I'm going to have them talk about fights

4106
03:12:42,251 --> 03:12:45,370
every week.
Who is going to watch the espn show?

4107
03:12:45,670 --> 03:12:48,640
If you can watch brian stann,
dominic serone and,

4108
03:12:48,910 --> 03:12:49,360
or,
uh,

4109
03:12:49,420 --> 03:12:54,420
uh,
donald cerrone and cruz talk about 

4110
03:12:54,420 --> 03:12:57,401
fights.
Who the fuck is going to watch anything 

4111
03:12:57,401 --> 03:12:57,401
else?
I want to hear what they have to say.

4112
03:12:57,401 --> 03:12:59,510
I want to hear what donald has to say 
about conor mcgregor.

4113
03:12:59,511 --> 03:13:02,120
I wanna hear with dominick.
Cruz has say about cody garbrandt.

4114
03:13:02,400 --> 03:13:07,400
I want to hear like what,
what these like super influential 

4115
03:13:07,400 --> 03:13:11,480
fighters who were like some of those 
interesting characters in the world.

4116
03:13:11,481 --> 03:13:16,481
I have to say you're not gonna be able 
to recreate that with some talking head 

4117
03:13:16,481 --> 03:13:19,990
that used to cover women's volleyball 
and now he's covering mma and you know 

4118
03:13:19,990 --> 03:13:21,470
last night,
blah blah blah.

4119
03:13:21,620 --> 03:13:25,720
Amanda nunez became the cleveland indian
women can mean,

4120
03:13:25,960 --> 03:13:27,140
you know,
he doesn't give a fuck.

4121
03:13:27,350 --> 03:13:29,660
He doesn't give a fuck.
He doesn't care.

4122
03:13:29,970 --> 03:13:31,760
You would,
you would watch the internet show,

4123
03:13:31,761 --> 03:13:33,860
right?
So if the internet was available on your

4124
03:13:33,861 --> 03:13:36,850
tv,
what's an espn gonna do.

4125
03:13:37,190 --> 03:13:41,150
And that's common man that's coming.
Bill burrs gonna have a fucking football

4126
03:13:41,151 --> 03:13:46,151
show on espn and everybody better shut 
their mouth because it's bill burr 

4127
03:13:46,151 --> 03:13:47,390
hasn't like if he does what he does on 
his podcast,

4128
03:13:47,540 --> 03:13:52,540
I don't even follow the nfl,
but when he starts making fun of people 

4129
03:13:52,540 --> 03:13:55,280
of the in the nfl and talking about fans
and stuff on his podcast,

4130
03:13:55,640 --> 03:14:00,640
it's hilarious if someone wises up and 
gives bill burr some sort of a platform,

4131
03:14:01,671 --> 03:14:05,540
a gigantic platform reviewing football.
Oh my god,

4132
03:14:05,800 --> 03:14:09,800
everybody else has done carl because he 
knows his shit too.

4133
03:14:10,160 --> 03:14:12,800
Like bill burr understands football.

4134
03:14:12,950 --> 03:14:14,300
Like when I listened to them like,
oh,

4135
03:14:14,301 --> 03:14:17,090
this guy is not just like a comedian 
talking shit about stuff.

4136
03:14:17,420 --> 03:14:22,420
he actually understands football.
I can listen to them talk about 

4137
03:14:22,420 --> 03:14:22,420
anything.
I love that dude.

4138
03:14:22,850 --> 03:14:24,080
He's an american treasure.
Fuck.

4139
03:14:24,090 --> 03:14:27,680
Yeah.
That's more like the delivery method has

4140
03:14:27,830 --> 03:14:30,010
outpaced.
Yes.

4141
03:14:31,100 --> 03:14:34,910
Content.
I guess it's eliminated the necessity of

4142
03:14:34,911 --> 03:14:39,911
a large studio.
Like a friend of mine was going to do 

4143
03:14:39,911 --> 03:14:39,911
something on the internet recently and 
he's like,

4144
03:14:40,430 --> 03:14:42,820
this group wants to pay me money to be,
you know,

4145
03:14:42,890 --> 03:14:44,870
to be associated with this.
And I go,

4146
03:14:44,900 --> 03:14:46,460
okay,
what are you going to do it on?

4147
03:14:46,520 --> 03:14:51,520
And he goes,
I'm going to do it on youtube and my 

4148
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:51,520
uncle,
uh,

4149
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:54,430
why would you want to,
why would you want someone coming along 

4150
03:14:54,430 --> 03:14:55,310
and being a part of that when you can 
just do it yourself.

4151
03:14:55,400 --> 03:14:56,000
Like if you get.

4152
03:14:56,240 --> 03:15:01,240
I'm like,
if you get in bed with this person or 

4153
03:15:01,240 --> 03:15:01,700
this group,
there's a media conglomerate,

4154
03:15:01,730 --> 03:15:06,730
you get a bed,
this media conglomerate with your 

4155
03:15:06,730 --> 03:15:06,730
project that you're trying to launch 
online,

4156
03:15:06,730 --> 03:15:07,970
you're going to be relieved as some of 
the financial burden.

4157
03:15:08,480 --> 03:15:12,140
But in this case I was talking to a guy 
is not hurting for money.

4158
03:15:12,170 --> 03:15:17,170
I'm like,
you're not talking about a substantial 

4159
03:15:17,170 --> 03:15:17,170
investment.
What do you need?

4160
03:15:17,170 --> 03:15:17,390
You need a camera.
You need to an employee,

4161
03:15:17,600 --> 03:15:20,420
you need an upload place.
You need to send out.

4162
03:15:20,450 --> 03:15:23,270
You need something like youtube is 
essentially free.

4163
03:15:23,271 --> 03:15:24,800
You just need a good internet 
connection.

4164
03:15:24,801 --> 03:15:29,801
Good computers like the,
the price of entry is not exorbitant in 

4165
03:15:29,801 --> 03:15:34,211
relationship to the potential.
But if you get involved with some sort 

4166
03:15:34,211 --> 03:15:35,870
of a media conglomerate,
these guys,

4167
03:15:36,230 --> 03:15:41,230
all of these people are very smart.
All these people that are involved in 

4168
03:15:41,230 --> 03:15:43,160
all these different networks,
they have existed for the longest time.

4169
03:15:43,190 --> 03:15:48,190
They are the old vampire versions of 
hollywood like they've existed forever 

4170
03:15:48,190 --> 03:15:52,900
and they've grown up in this and some of
them have come along in different 

4171
03:15:52,900 --> 03:15:54,960
transitionary phase of the system,
but they realize right now the system is

4172
03:15:54,961 --> 03:15:59,190
in jeopardy.
It's in a very strange place because the

4173
03:15:59,191 --> 03:16:03,180
internet is slowly becoming more and 
more prevalent in people's lives.

4174
03:16:03,181 --> 03:16:08,181
It's consuming more and more people's 
entertainment time and it's becoming 

4175
03:16:08,181 --> 03:16:12,231
more powerful and its abilities.
The ability that someone has today is 

4176
03:16:12,231 --> 03:16:13,290
what you can create an edit on a 
computer.

4177
03:16:13,530 --> 03:16:18,530
It's literally getting to the point 
where I could make a movie with you and 

4178
03:16:18,530 --> 03:16:21,801
you don't even have to be in it.
I can just decide I'm going to make 

4179
03:16:21,801 --> 03:16:23,260
fucking slumber party 10 with jamie 
vernon and slow.

4180
03:16:23,340 --> 03:16:28,340
Jamie vernon shows up aT the door with a
fucking pizza delivery outfit on and 15 

4181
03:16:28,340 --> 03:16:32,930
skanky hose.
Just dive on his pecker and we make a 

4182
03:16:32,930 --> 03:16:32,930
porn.
I mean,

4183
03:16:32,930 --> 03:16:36,910
this 100 percent possible.
That's the only like 10 years away from 

4184
03:16:36,910 --> 03:16:36,910
now,
man,

4185
03:16:36,910 --> 03:16:39,960
and you're going to be able to stream 
things online.

4186
03:16:39,990 --> 03:16:44,990
You're going to be able to create a film
with a regular laptop in a fucking phone

4187
03:16:46,051 --> 03:16:47,760
and it's going to look like a goddamn 
movie.

4188
03:16:47,761 --> 03:16:48,990
People have probably already done it.

4189
03:16:49,460 --> 03:16:51,560
snapchat filters,
so there's a good example.

4190
03:16:51,561 --> 03:16:53,180
If you do it right now I can make a 
movie.

4191
03:16:53,220 --> 03:16:55,220
Jamie I gay porn.
Exactly.

4192
03:16:55,250 --> 03:17:00,250
I read an article about what you're 
talking about really that they used the 

4193
03:17:00,250 --> 03:17:03,371
example of the new peewee herman movie 
that he looks a little too young for 

4194
03:17:03,371 --> 03:17:06,731
what he should be throughout the movie,
but they article describes how there's 

4195
03:17:06,731 --> 03:17:09,851
this thing called what they're called 
cgi facelifts and there's multiple 

4196
03:17:09,851 --> 03:17:14,710
million dollar actors and actresses that
use teams of people or keep them at a 

4197
03:17:14,710 --> 03:17:16,580
younger looking and in movies like.
Like whaT the did for benjamin button.

4198
03:17:16,720 --> 03:17:21,720
She made brad pitt stay younger.
Looking at like was strapping 22 year 

4199
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:23,630
old dude when he was really like 45.
That's just a filter.

4200
03:17:23,631 --> 03:17:25,820
You can tell the detail level is just 
fogged out,

4201
03:17:25,850 --> 03:17:27,440
you know,
as a still frame.

4202
03:17:27,441 --> 03:17:32,441
It's a filter,
but he looks like that throughout the 

4203
03:17:32,441 --> 03:17:32,441
whole movie.
So it's a separate video on that.

4204
03:17:32,570 --> 03:17:34,370
I think he's.
What he's saying is that this is a still

4205
03:17:34,371 --> 03:17:35,990
frame of the video.
Yeah.

4206
03:17:36,080 --> 03:17:37,230
And uh,
but there's just like.

4207
03:17:37,290 --> 03:17:38,540
I know what you're saying.
No,

4208
03:17:38,541 --> 03:17:43,541
no,
I was saying they're doing it through 

4209
03:17:43,541 --> 03:17:43,580
movies and a rabbit.
This is the whole movie.

4210
03:17:43,581 --> 03:17:44,520
It's like this,
right?

4211
03:17:44,690 --> 03:17:46,240
Like,
is this an actual still friends?

4212
03:17:46,280 --> 03:17:47,020
As far as I know.
Yeah.

4213
03:17:47,021 --> 03:17:52,021
I looked.
Even snapchat has that one filter that 

4214
03:17:52,021 --> 03:17:54,521
makes.
It's called the pretty filter or 

4215
03:17:54,521 --> 03:17:54,521
beautiful filter.
It just pretty much does the same thing.

4216
03:17:54,521 --> 03:17:56,660
I kinda softens your face and gets rid 
of the detail.

4217
03:17:56,870 --> 03:17:58,730
Well,
have you seen the real life filters that

4218
03:17:58,731 --> 03:18:03,731
they use in their.
They have this new thing that they've 

4219
03:18:03,731 --> 03:18:06,641
invented where it's a film that they put
on your skin and it radically reduces 

4220
03:18:06,641 --> 03:18:07,240
wrinkles.
Oh wow.

4221
03:18:07,550 --> 03:18:10,130
Like it's an invisible film.
It lasts 24 hours.

4222
03:18:10,520 --> 03:18:15,520
You put it on your skin and it's 
waterproof and it radically reduces 

4223
03:18:15,520 --> 03:18:15,800
wrinkles.
Have you seen this?

4224
03:18:15,801 --> 03:18:16,540
No,
I haven't seen it.

4225
03:18:16,620 --> 03:18:18,950
Cool.
Fucking weird thing to think about it.

4226
03:18:19,130 --> 03:18:21,020
We're going to bang some old lady's 
dude.

4227
03:18:21,080 --> 03:18:23,510
Oh god,
100 percent for you.

4228
03:18:23,550 --> 03:18:28,550
Good.
You drink a loT of good with my 22 year 

4229
03:18:28,550 --> 03:18:28,550
old.
Remember that time in austin?

4230
03:18:28,550 --> 03:18:32,200
Which one do you remember the time where
a lady sat next to you and started 

4231
03:18:32,421 --> 03:18:35,180
kissing you and you were hammered?
You thought it was the wrong lady.

4232
03:18:36,020 --> 03:18:38,390
Do you remember that?
We've talked about that before.

4233
03:18:38,391 --> 03:18:42,350
The old lady,
old lady got deep into brian's face.

4234
03:18:42,380 --> 03:18:43,790
Mountain.
Brian's mouth was.

4235
03:18:43,970 --> 03:18:47,980
His eyes were closed the whole time.
Brown brian had a lovely lady with him.

4236
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:49,360
And by the way,
this is a long,

4237
03:18:49,361 --> 03:18:50,710
long time ago.
Yeah.

4238
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:53,410
Any parties currently invested in mr 
brian red band.

4239
03:18:53,411 --> 03:18:54,940
Need not worry.
Many,

4240
03:18:54,941 --> 03:18:55,330
many,
many,

4241
03:18:55,331 --> 03:18:55,780
many,
many,

4242
03:18:55,781 --> 03:18:57,350
many moons ago.
And uh,

4243
03:18:57,520 --> 03:19:00,610
this lovely young lady took off and 
this,

4244
03:19:00,611 --> 03:19:01,300
uh,
this,

4245
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:07,440
this woman parked her broomstick and sat
down next to god like 70 years old.

4246
03:19:10,211 --> 03:19:12,010
No tea,
no bullshit.

4247
03:19:12,011 --> 03:19:14,380
At least 60,
no bullshit.

4248
03:19:15,010 --> 03:19:18,220
At least 60.
And she just attacked me out of nowhere.

4249
03:19:18,340 --> 03:19:21,430
Plopped down next year.
Put her hand on your chest.

4250
03:19:21,431 --> 03:19:24,670
You smiled and looked over with your 
eyes closed.

4251
03:19:24,880 --> 03:19:29,880
And she dove in for The kiss and you 
thought you were kissing the other girl 

4252
03:19:29,880 --> 03:19:31,090
and then you realized in the middle it 
was like,

4253
03:19:31,210 --> 03:19:36,210
oh,
it's like there's a horror movie where 

4254
03:19:36,210 --> 03:19:38,641
that happens.
Where the guys making out with the girl 

4255
03:19:38,641 --> 03:19:39,370
and her face falls apart.
You realize that she's a monster.

4256
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:41,160
Isn't there a horror movie like that?
Well,

4257
03:19:41,400 --> 03:19:46,400
in part of Indiana jones where they 
opened up the chest and that nazis face 

4258
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:46,400
melts.
Kind of.

4259
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:46,930
Yeah,
it's like that.

4260
03:19:46,931 --> 03:19:49,870
But there was a movie where a guy was 
making out with a girl and I want to say

4261
03:19:49,871 --> 03:19:53,320
like her hair started falling out or 
something like that was god damn it.

4262
03:19:53,321 --> 03:19:54,540
What movie was it?
Oh,

4263
03:19:54,730 --> 03:19:59,730
the shining is this shining.
remember Jack Nicholson goes into one of

4264
03:19:59,861 --> 03:20:04,861
those mysterious rooms and he starts 
making out with this woman and her skin 

4265
03:20:04,861 --> 03:20:05,740
starts falling off exactly what it is.
IT's exactly what it is.

4266
03:20:05,770 --> 03:20:07,090
Oh my god.
Find that scene.

4267
03:20:07,091 --> 03:20:11,710
Let's end this podcast and you recorded 
the whole thing on video and you thought

4268
03:20:11,711 --> 03:20:13,660
you were doing me a favor by deleting 
it.

4269
03:20:13,661 --> 03:20:15,850
I would love to have seen that.
I know I fucked up.

4270
03:20:15,851 --> 03:20:16,900
I was trying to protect her brother.

4271
03:20:17,500 --> 03:20:19,330
It was dark.
It was dark shit.

4272
03:20:19,350 --> 03:20:21,820
I don't even think she had teeth.
She was a monster.

4273
03:20:22,010 --> 03:20:24,670
I was right out of the swamps.
She came out of swamps.

4274
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:27,400
You can't show it.
But for us,

4275
03:20:27,460 --> 03:20:30,250
can we see it where nobody else sees it?
Put it on,

4276
03:20:30,310 --> 03:20:33,610
make sure that nobody sees it,
which just showed you and nobody can see

4277
03:20:33,611 --> 03:20:34,030
it.
Right.

4278
03:20:34,570 --> 03:20:35,530
Okay.
Yeah.

4279
03:20:35,531 --> 03:20:38,350
So she's super,
super hot in that 19 seventies.

4280
03:20:38,351 --> 03:20:42,010
I don't know how to work out hot,
which is great for like eight years.

4281
03:20:42,100 --> 03:20:42,760
Nice area.
Look,

4282
03:20:42,790 --> 03:20:45,730
girls,
girls have that hot for eight years,

4283
03:20:45,820 --> 03:20:47,860
right around 26.
It starts to go,

4284
03:20:47,861 --> 03:20:49,360
hey.
Um,

4285
03:20:49,660 --> 03:20:51,430
we're not really making the same amount 
of hormones anymore.

4286
03:20:51,431 --> 03:20:54,510
And you don't want to play soccer.
Oh,

4287
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:57,610
what's going on with his body like that?
Bush full bush,

4288
03:20:57,930 --> 03:20:58,940
bush,
bush.

4289
03:20:59,260 --> 03:21:00,490
Uh,
which by the way,

4290
03:21:00,730 --> 03:21:01,990
I don't mind.
I don't mind.

4291
03:21:02,200 --> 03:21:07,200
It doesn't bother me at all.
It was Jack Nicholson doesn't know what 

4292
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:07,200
to do.
She's touching him.

4293
03:21:07,660 --> 03:21:08,800
Oh shit.

4294
03:21:11,620 --> 03:21:16,620
I don't remember this scene.
and I definitely don't remember the 

4295
03:21:16,620 --> 03:21:17,680
scene being this long.
I remember it being like real short.

4296
03:21:17,980 --> 03:21:21,460
I feel like I watched this recently and 
don't remember the scene in the movie.

4297
03:21:21,520 --> 03:21:23,530
I remember it happened for sure.
Which is why I brought it up,

4298
03:21:23,531 --> 03:21:25,660
but I don't remember it.
Like I'm looking at it.

4299
03:21:25,661 --> 03:21:29,620
This all seems super new to me.
So he starts making out with her.

4300
03:21:29,850 --> 03:21:31,870
she's got to fly the house,
squats,

4301
03:21:32,710 --> 03:21:34,090
go to go to the gym,
bitch.

4302
03:21:34,240 --> 03:21:34,960
Oh,
oh.

4303
03:21:34,961 --> 03:21:37,100
So he's kissing her and in the middle of
kissing her,

4304
03:21:37,101 --> 03:21:37,660
I was like,
oh,

4305
03:21:37,661 --> 03:21:42,661
he's having such a good time.
You could see that she looks a little 

4306
03:21:42,661 --> 03:21:42,661
bony.
Yeah,

4307
03:21:42,661 --> 03:21:42,661
something's not right.
Something's wrong.

4308
03:21:42,661 --> 03:21:47,310
Then he opens his eyes and he opens his 
eyes and you realize she's an old lady.

4309
03:21:47,340 --> 03:21:50,180
His eyes go wide open.
He can't even enjoy it.

4310
03:21:50,210 --> 03:21:51,620
He's a hater.
Oh,

4311
03:21:51,621 --> 03:21:53,110
she's got turns.
Moly.

4312
03:21:53,150 --> 03:21:58,150
Caesar in the mirror and her back in the
mirror is covered with welts and his 

4313
03:21:58,150 --> 03:22:02,021
little kid starts seizure.
And now she's in the tub and he's 

4314
03:22:02,021 --> 03:22:03,190
backing up.
She's decaying.

4315
03:22:03,210 --> 03:22:05,990
She's laughing and coming towards him.
Holy shit,

4316
03:22:05,991 --> 03:22:08,450
this is a good movie.
It's like an old lady from kingpin.

4317
03:22:08,600 --> 03:22:09,650
See,
here's my point.

4318
03:22:09,860 --> 03:22:11,330
Where the fuck are these movies?
Man?

4319
03:22:11,750 --> 03:22:14,510
This is my kind of movie.
I like horror movies.

4320
03:22:14,960 --> 03:22:17,150
I'm a huge fan.
I like monster movies.

4321
03:22:17,330 --> 03:22:19,460
I like horror movies.
Doesn't have to be real.

4322
03:22:19,461 --> 03:22:20,330
I know it's not real.

4323
03:22:20,590 --> 03:22:22,540
I haven't seen him,
but I heard that movie.

4324
03:22:22,541 --> 03:22:24,670
Green room is supposed to be pretty 
interesting.

4325
03:22:24,820 --> 03:22:29,820
What's that?
There's a new one called a where the 

4326
03:22:29,820 --> 03:22:29,820
blind man can't see it.
It looks pretty intense too.

4327
03:22:29,820 --> 03:22:30,670
I forgoT.
Don't,

4328
03:22:30,760 --> 03:22:31,900
don't talk or don't whisper.

4329
03:22:32,190 --> 03:22:35,280
How could that be as good as this green 
room story of louie anderson?

4330
03:22:36,190 --> 03:22:40,250
Derek,
really high for gay.

4331
03:22:43,440 --> 03:22:43,780
Liliana

4332
03:22:43,890 --> 03:22:45,870
sends a wonderful gentlemen.
I love him.

4333
03:22:45,871 --> 03:22:50,871
I think he's a hilarious comedian.
Let's find this bitch.

4334
03:22:52,770 --> 03:22:57,770
Let's bring it home.
Thank you everybody for the happy 

4335
