1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,260
It's just a perfect situation and we're
live.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,733
Yeah.
And what?

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,110
And it's a UFC.
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,340
Yeah.
We're talking about UFC fight companion

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,830
podcast.
There is so ridiculously fun.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,170
More fun than doing it live.
Yeah.

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,310
And then what I was saying is what makes
him super crazy special for me.

8
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,100
I look forward to them so much as it's
not just the best possible podcast

9
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:23,640
situation.
The most fun at the funniest shit.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,150
We could talk about anything we could
talk about gay shit.

11
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,160
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:31,770
We can do anything.
You can talk about sucking Dick.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,970
We could talk and we totally get away
with it and people started getting sick

14
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:37,470
of it though.
So we should probably pull back.

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,870
I don't know.
Give them more deck.

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,790
No,
they,

17
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,900
I don't give a fuck.
People are getting pissed this and some

18
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,660
people are getting past those people you
can't worry about.

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,450
But the coolest thing.
Well not the whole assemble it makes it

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,140
extra cool is it's the best possible
podcast situation period.

21
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,650
Yeah.
And there's a UFC going on at the same

22
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:59,610
fucking time and we're all having fun.
It's like you can't take it.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,990
It's like you were doing a podcast,
the funniest shit ever while the

24
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:07,310
greatest show that's ever been invented
on at the same time,

25
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:10,230
a combination of those things and it's
the fica is boring.

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,040
If for whatever reason it's stagnant,
we just start talking about fucking

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,330
owls,
EMC,

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,810
but if people get upset talking about
dicks lik that's just where the

29
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:24,390
conversation goes sometimes.
Don't worry about that.

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,750
We're trying the best we can to be
entertaining.

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,250
That's all we're trying to.
There's gonna be some slip ups.

32
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,140
If you feel like we're getting too much
dick in there,

33
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,340
you're allowed to express yourself.

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,350
I must have that.
We might have a pretty strong gay

35
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,250
following now.
I hope we do.

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,160
I hope we do.
Probably know.

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,140
I hope we do.
We're making them feel comfortable.

38
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,630
I hope they do feel comfortable.
I'm just keeping it real.

39
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,670
I see a guy like Alan on.
I just keep it real.

40
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,370
He's a beautiful man,
but even more important than who gives a

41
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:49,070
fuck,
you know,

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,590
this is the thing like that.
It's even remotely controversial that we

43
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:55,170
would have a gay following.
Probably have a following of Irish

44
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,730
people to.
You know what I mean?

45
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,370
Who Cares?
Who gives a fuck taking of the Irish

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,790
speaking.
I've got them right here.

47
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,500
Oh Man.
Hey listen,

48
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,090
man,
this guy has balls.

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,760
This is why I respect the fuck out of
conor Mcgregor.

50
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,440
Not just because he's an awesome fighter
and yeah,

51
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,990
he lost Nate Diaz who's also an awesome
fighter,

52
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:17,730
but who the fuck will fight anybody who
will just jump up.

53
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,110
Alaska was Bj.
Bj tried it and you know what?

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,750
Even though a Bj didn't,
he had success once.

55
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:28,230
At least at one 70 he beat Matt Hughes,
but at the end of the day,

56
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,880
there's a really good reason why all
elite boxers,

57
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:34,410
wrestlers,
fighters,

58
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,790
weight cutting is so massively
important.

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,690
Virtually everybody.
There are some crazy people out there

60
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:44,970
like Anthony Johnson.
That's the exception,

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,350
but generally there's a really good
reason most people are torturing

62
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:52,980
themselves to get as light as possible
because at the elite level,

63
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,340
five pounds makes a big fucking
difference.

64
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,140
It makes a big difference.
Just five pounds,

65
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,590
10 pounds,
10 pounds.

66
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,130
Different

67
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,600
elite level,
man.

68
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,170
Even the best guys aren't going up.
Went looking for Mendez,

69
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,940
no doubt.
Probably pound for pound.

70
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,380
The best guy in Jujitsu,
probably him and Marcello's.

71
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,941
John.
Jack,

72
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,160
they're all up there.
Bam,

73
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,870
pound for pound.
There's so many good guys.

74
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,920
Now Jesus.
It's incredible.

75
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,090
Now.
You know what I mean?

76
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,830
Uh,
you know,

77
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,250
even Marcello is trying to go up in
weight.

78
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,240
When I was trying to go,
let me this year,

79
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,910
I'm going to try the weight category
above me.

80
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,940
Know everybody's on the craziest died.
They need three months to get serious

81
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:32,440
about it.
Then on instagram posts in there,

82
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:35,140
fucking Broccoli every day.
The chicken,

83
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,190
fucking selfies of their,
of their and you know,

84
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,360
the killing themselves because now
because it feels good.

85
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,670
It feels like shit.
They all love eating.

86
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,220
It means it's so important.
Uh,

87
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,320
so everybody knows you just can't go up
and Goddamn.

88
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,920
Wait,
Jay was.

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,680
Pj was the one that said fuck it.
He went up to light heavyweight and

90
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:57,514
shit.

91
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,280
Five foot eight.
No,

92
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,550
it wasn't even light heavyweight bro.
It was heavyweight because Livida

93
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,160
Machida was like two.
Oh,

94
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,340
eight.
Okay.

95
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,060
I think that fight was like technically
a heavyweight fight.

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Find that out.
But with Bj Penn Cheetah,

97
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,590
you know what I mean,
he was fat that's out of shape,

98
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,830
but you ever see when he used to fight
like kickbox fat,

99
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,090
his first UFC fight,
that's not as real weight.

100
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:27,430
His real weight is 205,
185.

101
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,660
So,
uh,

102
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,260
but Bj did it and I always admired him.
I,

103
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,320
I,
to me and to me I looked,

104
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,720
I'll always look at Bj as a living
legend.

105
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,763
Yeah,
the guy didn't.

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,620
He's not undefeated.
He got his ass beat a few times.

107
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,260
Who gives a fuck?
Look what Bj did.

108
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,580
He had the balls to step up and really
he was a 45 or just like,

109
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,990
just like there's no.
The whole time he was a foreigner.

110
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,100
And in Jujitsu he was a 45.
He was always a 45 or fighting at 55 70.

111
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,760
Nobody else was doing it.
And you know,

112
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:59,110
Connor,
here he comes.

113
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,640
Connor,
this guy

114
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,400
has so much power in his hands.
He had that courage to think he could

115
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,750
finish what Bj started,
you know,

116
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,240
let me go up there and do that.
Do what Bj did.

117
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,021
But,
you know,

118
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,480
he felt like he could fucking knock
anybody out.

119
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,180
He really,
really believed he could fucking,

120
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,350
he will be lanced you're going down and
you know what he was doing great against

121
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:24,780
Nate Diaz.
I mean,

122
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,140
this is my,
this is my,

123
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,910
this is how I found out I'm watching.
I'm at a party slam Lee's house.

124
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,330
And uh,
I didn't realize we were behind by a

125
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,560
minute and a half.
We were live.

126
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,370
I thought we were alive,
but we were behind biomineral.

127
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,680
Everyone's going nuts.
I'm watching going.

128
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:46,080
Oh Shit.
Lizzie borden.

129
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,880
Sit next to me.
My childhood idol.

130
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,310
He's one of my greatest favorite lead
singers of all time.

131
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:54,190
We sit next to him more watching
everyone's going nuts.

132
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,560
It looks like Connor's to me.
I was like,

133
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,560
Connor's to win this thing man.
He was light nate up cutting them all

134
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,060
up.
He was connecting.

135
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,940
He looked really confident.
Like Carla called that whole first

136
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:05,950
round.
I was gone.

137
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,190
It's,
it's,

138
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,641
uh,
it was,

139
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,120
it was over in the forest.
Second second.

140
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,830
It was a second.
So at in that round,

141
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,490
I get a call from Joey,
Joey's,

142
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,191
I go,
oh,

143
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,580
you know how much I want to know how
much I told you.

144
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,130
I told you you never bet against Diaz.
I go,

145
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,680
what are you talking about?
I thought it was watching.

146
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,010
Are you talking about the Meesha fight?

147
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,710
He goes,
no motherfucker.

148
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,830
He got choked.
Go.

149
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,360
Who got choked up?
Called the home,

150
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:31,930
got choked out.
I'm watching the data as we know.

151
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,680
Motherfucker.
What thought of you watching right now?

152
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,860
I'm watching the conor pipe as it's
going on.

153
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,870
He goes,
he choked him out.

154
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm like,
dude,

155
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,840
fuck.
And he goes,

156
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,400
by boom.
He realized he fucked up and I'm like,

157
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,930
I knew that Diaz was gonna win a minute.
You've lost pee or something.

158
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,600
We were at a party and it was just
behind someone for awhile and shit.

159
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,120
And you didn't fast forward it.
So we thought it was live.

160
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,620
So Joey Joey called me hysterical and he
gave it away.

161
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,960
And then once he realized he gave it
away,

162
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,490
he hung up and said,
oh shit.

163
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,350
And I said,
Oh shit.

164
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,270
He just fucked up the greatest fight
ever,

165
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,330
but the fight was so crazy and so
fucking insane that even though I knew

166
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,580
better,
even though I knew I go,

167
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,430
okay,
somehow nate is going to take him down

168
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:24,980
and choke him out,
but it doesn't look good right here.

169
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,500
I'm like,
how is he going to take connor down?

170
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,870
That's not going to bz fuck.
He's going to pull this off.

171
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:33,010
How is he going to do it?
I had no idea that may.

172
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,920
It hurts connor.
Connor takes him down,

173
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,510
you know?
That's how it went down.

174
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,020
The place I was at was going fucking
nuts.

175
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,310
Everybody was screaming at the top of
the fucking longs.

176
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,040
Everyone's and then when he choked him
out,

177
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,280
dude,
I'd never been in a party where everyone

178
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:57,281
was going so crazy before everybody was
losing their fucking mind.

179
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:02,471
I was too holy Shit blind.
Everybody was going crazy.

180
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,610
I almost had a.
I never screamed so loud in my

181
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:12,470
motherfucking life at any fight ever.
That was shocking.

182
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,170
It was.
It looked like Karma was just had his

183
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:17,090
hands down because I got this mother
fucker.

184
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,800
He was landon.
He was tagging them,

185
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,390
it looked like you heard them a couple
times.

186
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,340
He tagged them,
you know what I mean?

187
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:24,860
It looked like he was.
I thought it was,

188
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,780
it was over for nate.
I really did.

189
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,990
And when he turned it around and the way
it finished and,

190
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,550
and when he put that fucking rear naked
choke and he put that motherfucker in

191
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,140
like a Super Ninja,
the weight,

192
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,450
first of all,
the way he mounted,

193
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,320
if you don't do Jujitsu,
you would never know the way he fucking

194
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,250
mounted and his balance.
You could see the balance.

195
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:50,750
You could see the beauty in that mound
and the way he was riding him,

196
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:54,140
like a professional fucking a champion
Rodeo.

197
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,080
Fucking reiner on his balances.

198
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,380
All beautiful.
And then when he took his back,

199
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,280
the way he put that fucking Hook in
there was,

200
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,150
it was so efficient.
There wasn't a hiccup where he hit the,

201
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,520
you know,
this jaw and then if you have a set up

202
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,530
and then to feel it just went.
It was fucking insanity.

203
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,770
So perfect.
And so fucking like that technique was

204
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,710
about is flawless and as beautiful as
you can get,

205
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,830
two big points was that we had never
seen conor face adversity and we had

206
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,380
never seen him on the ground with a real
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

207
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:34,140
Like nate.
Nate's got a nasty ground game man.

208
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,690
His name,
but I.

209
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,790
People are talking to a lot of shit on
connor's Jujitsu.

210
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,310
I know connor.
Jujitsu is good.

211
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,710
He's coming to my school.
That guys good?

212
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,590
Just cause he got mountain down.
Yeah,

213
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:48,990
he was already here.
But even if he wasn't her,

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,170
I get mounted by my purple belt
sometimes and I get my bag.

215
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,660
There's some shit going on and at
punches and fucking all this height.

216
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,760
Just because he got mountain and got us
back taking does not mean connor's

217
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:01,470
Jujitsu sucks.
Don't get it twisted.

218
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:04,880
He was a little hurt.
Nate Diaz is really good stuff.

219
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,220
Really good.
You know what I mean?

220
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,930
Like Nate Diaz could probably do that to
me.

221
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:12,060
Doesn't mean I suck.
You know what I mean?

222
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,100
He could probably get my back.
Doesn't mean I suck.

223
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:16,110
I'm a high,
you know so.

224
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,310
Well,
he got hurt him.

225
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,470
It's real simple.
When you get tagged the way he got

226
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:22,260
tagged trying to take Nate Diaz down.
He got hurt.

227
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,660
He probably had no idea what the fuck he
was doing.

228
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,400
You know,
I haven't had an MMA fight,

229
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:30,690
but sharp was telling me about when
Travis Browne hit him and that he was

230
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:31,141
like,
dude,

231
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,360
I know how to get out of the mountain,
but when travis hit me,

232
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,040
he's like,
I didn't know what I was doing.

233
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,180
It was.
I was out of it.

234
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,600
I think that we should get punched in
the face,

235
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,190
but I can't judge his Jujitsu.
You're judging is walking if you get

236
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,270
head kicked.
Commerce.

237
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,280
Jujitsu is good.
Nate Diaz.

238
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,380
Jujitsu is just way better.
You know what I'm saying?

239
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,540
If that's all it is,
suddenly punches you in the face and

240
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,440
then you walk funny.
I'm like,

241
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,790
man,
you need to work on your walking.

242
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,700
Funny memes of Connor,
like add in like a kids Jujitsu class.

243
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,150
They put a slice.
That's one that's going around that.

244
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,440
I think that's hurt.
You know what he's heard?

245
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:05,700
He is good.
Trust me.

246
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,800
Connors.
Jujitsu is very,

247
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,440
very standard to me.
He's not a joke,

248
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,980
especially in that first round was nasty
standup,

249
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,330
like very good.
He's just a look.

250
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,240
First of all,
he's not a real one.

251
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,430
70 old lady did fight one 70 twice.

252
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,990
He fought a stun gun.
Kim and fought rory.

253
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,130
Rory Macdonald,
remember that?

254
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,580
Fought those guys at one 70.
So he did have to fight at one 70,

255
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:32,460
but he's a 1:50 fiber.
These are big one.

256
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:37,140
50th five or he's big and long.
I don't know if he could ever make 1:45.

257
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,290
I just don't think he could do it.
Connor barely can do it.

258
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,090
You know,
connor apparently can do it.

259
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,090
When you see conor at the weigh ins,
I mean those photos from the winds are

260
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,600
pretty legendary.
I think it's insane that we do this,

261
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,970
that we let these guys dehydrate
themselves like that.

262
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:54,730
I think whatever nature walks that,
that's what he should fight.

263
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,610
And I don't know if connor really walks
around at one slash 68,

264
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,860
which would he weighed in and nate raid
one 69.

265
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,170
There were only one pound different.
And Nate,

266
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,000
you know,
nate had some body fat on him because he

267
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,860
wasn't,
it wasn't preparing for this at all.

268
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,010
I think connor,
connor could make some noise at 1:55

269
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,090
shrink down to see the two of those
together.

270
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,260
Can we look at the difference between
how we weighed in before and how he

271
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,940
weighed in this time?
I mean,

272
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:22,540
my God,
he looks like he has some fucking crazy

273
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,780
disease that like won't let food
absorbent his body on the top one,

274
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,830
you know,
like he's got some crazy illness and

275
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,830
then on the bottom he looks great full
faced.

276
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,240
But you know,
if you can make 1:45,

277
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:40,140
he's going to continue to do it.
Can you think gets in.

278
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,950
The girls are like sitting right there.
Is that an accident is perfect for the

279
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,440
pictures.
That's why they stand their ultimate

280
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,390
man.
It's to balance out that dude in

281
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:52,990
underwear
put chips in there.

282
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:57,520
So that's exactly what it was.
That's funny.

283
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,080
That's funny.
That's what I think he could completely

284
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,080
dominate.
Continue to dominate the 1:45 division

285
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,250
and I think he could make a lot of epic
fights at 1:55,

286
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,830
five.
Went beat some big names but then lose

287
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:15,010
to some other big names,
like he'll be one of the top guys at 55.

288
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,130
I don't know if he'll just clean house
like he did at 45,

289
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,820
but I believe if he stayed at 55 he
would do some serious damage.

290
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,860
He's a bad motherfucker.
Yeah.

291
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:26,050
He's a shitty saying after the fight.

292
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,750
That's perfect ship.
Perfect Shit.

293
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,890
I love what he's doing.
I love how he's handling it.

294
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,860
I think he handled it his last better
than anybody ever,

295
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,950
ever.
He said children victory and I'm be

296
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:39,040
humbling defeat.
No matter what happened in that fight.

297
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,930
His next fight,
whoever he's fighting,

298
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,090
he's going to get fucked up.
You know what I mean?

299
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,010
Maybe.
I mean,

300
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,250
would it be fights?
Dos Anjos,

301
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,610
you know
he's going to cut them up.

302
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,670
I bet it tags them a few times.
I bet you're right.

303
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,740
I bet he tags and I bet you're asking
tag everybody to hit some people and

304
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:55,180
just because he got knocked out a lot of
people,

305
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,400
every half the people get knocked out
and fights.

306
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,880
He got knocked out,
he got,

307
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,390
he got cracked and he got choked,
but I'm,

308
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,860
I'm interested in to see how he handles
the physicality of Dos Anjos who's a lot

309
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,030
more physical than nate.

310
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,830
You know,
dos Anjos is a beast.

311
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:11,080
I want to.
I want to know if he could do to connor

312
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:14,800
what he was able to do to nate,
but he was able to do to a lot of guys

313
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,240
like pedis,
what he did to pedis,

314
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,990
you know that God is strong as shit,
but I was so bummed out when he broke

315
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:21,130
his foot,
I was like,

316
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:23,050
God,
that's a crazy fight and so it's going

317
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,250
to be there,
but fucking nate,

318
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,280
all of a sudden they start
that little stoner is going to be.

319
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,030
He's dude,
he's,

320
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,940
he's super famous now.
Everybody knows,

321
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,430
dude,
he has the greatest all time.

322
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:41,560
Post-Fight line.
I got to say,

323
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,800
I'm not surprised.
Motherfuckers know what's funny.

324
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,630
You know what's due in the beginning,
conor won the verbal.

325
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:51,950
That battles the first couple press
commerce.

326
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,070
He kinda did.
Connor came full blown and then nate,

327
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,990
nate one towards the end,
I felt that nate was in connor's had,

328
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,770
I think it reversed at bay.
I think he was pissing connor off that

329
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,460
he kept saying,
fuck you.

330
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,500
He just wouldn't gangster on them.
Every time my crew will fuck up your

331
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,380
crew.
Like I said,

332
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,970
if you want to make this fucking serious
week,

333
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,700
we're going to pass by you guys
somewhere in the small fucking hotel

334
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,410
will jump.
You will do that.

335
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,010
You guys want to do that will actually
jump you guys and it'll be all over

336
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:26,280
fucking shirt on the ship.
You know that a pen.

337
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Dania and gotten a full blown street
fight on the set of tough head kicks.

338
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,290
Everything.
You know,

339
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:39,291
those two bad ass chicks.
Cologic a Dahlia is a bad ass bitch.

340
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,100
You've seen her fight,
right?

341
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,550
She's nasty.
You know what?

342
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,200
She's one that I have zero images in my
shoes.

343
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,950
Nasty.
Her and Joan Jett check had a,

344
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,000
um,
they had a really close first fight

345
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,130
split decision when for you on Jay
check.

346
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,080
So they coached opposite side each
other.

347
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,470
She's the number one contender.
When does that ferocious?

348
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,320
She's ferocious.
I liked the ultimate fighter Bolus will.

349
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,940
Sounds good.
One to John Jay.

350
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,270
Check is ferocious.
And Claudia good.

351
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,091
Dahlia?
Yeah,

352
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:10,020
there it is in Brazil fight.
Yeah man,

353
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:13,110
she's a Nova on yow girl.
She's good.

354
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,600
She's a fuck Ya.
Real good.

355
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,270
Jujitsu and strong as shit.
Strong as shit.

356
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,720
When they fought the first time where
she was winning was on the ground and

357
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,220
she was doing well on the feet too.

358
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,240
But you on a corner with a big upper cut
I think in the first round of rocked

359
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:28,980
her,
but when she's trying to take her down

360
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,880
I'd have to go back and watch it again.
I remember specifics that you want a

361
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,240
cracker with a big upper cut and hurt
her,

362
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,560
but that Claudia had overwhelmed her and
some of the ground exchanges and a lot

363
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:43,110
of people were thinking that you and Jay
check was going to have more problems

364
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:45,990
with grapplers.
Like Carla Esparza or like,

365
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:46,960
um,
you know,

366
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,430
Carl was a wrestler or like,
um,

367
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,300
uh,
Juliana pinay.

368
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,363
What's now?
No,

369
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,050
Jessica.
Jessica Panay,

370
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,370
the second title defense that she had.
These girls try to wrestle with her

371
00:16:59,371 --> 00:16:59,771
though.
She can.

372
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:01,440
You can't wrestle with her anymore.
She's.

373
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,210
She got better.
She's nasty.

374
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,370
She's really fucking slick.
Standing up.

375
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,060
And apparently they just went to war.
They just on the set,

376
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,350
beat the shit out of each other.

377
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,980
You're Dana White.
What do you do with a Misha Dude?

378
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,080
Pillow her up.
She's huge,

379
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,610
but who have regis?
I don't know,

380
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,860
man,
but give her a world tour first.

381
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,130
She,
she won one of the greatest victories in

382
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:31,131
the history of mma down down on the
score cards in the fourth round with two

383
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:34,500
minutes to go.
She hits a take down,

384
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,920
takes her back,
almost gets shook over the top,

385
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,990
hangs on,
hangs on.

386
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,470
That was so dramatic.
That was like the end of.

387
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,710
She fought so smart.
She did everything that all the experts

388
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,890
were saying she was going to need to do.
She did everything.

389
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,570
She didn't rush in Russian and she had
to pull it off.

390
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:56,370
And like,
what was our minute left?

391
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,640
Tom?
Like somewhere around two minutes to go

392
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:01,410
when she went for the take down.
When she,

393
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,610
when she got ahold of her.

394
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,460
So you're down to last round.
Last round.

395
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,890
Enjoy wasn't winning the round.
Nothing really had happened.

396
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,520
That was like big and significant.
She had a takedown,

397
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,040
probably lose it on the cards.
Crappy.

398
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,180
I didn't look at the cards,
but you know,

399
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,120
she won that one round for sure.
When she take her down and that went

400
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,250
made everybody go,
oh shit.

401
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,920
Is that the second was at the second
round that she took her down?

402
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:25,620
This was dominating her.
Um,

403
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,110
yeah,
I think it was the second her was

404
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,100
wrestling.
Surprisingly.

405
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,340
Her wrestling is a lot better than
before.

406
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,630
Before she's hustling to.
She hustled,

407
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:35,790
she keeps getting better.
And Holly Holm and easy to take down.

408
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,350
Take down the fence.
That's like her main shit too.

409
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,230
Probably works on her takedown defense
more than her Jujitsu.

410
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,350
So this is the cards.

411
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,303
Yeah.

412
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,680
So what does it say in basically what
are we going in here?

413
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,550
Me,
you should take this hard to do.

414
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,950
These are confusing.
White,

415
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:52,731
blue,
pink.

416
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,620
There's a pink card.
I get the.

417
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,090
Oh,
the different people.

418
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,500
Just as the referee's names.
Okay.

419
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,140
So round nine.
So 10,

420
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,730
nine.
Well,

421
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:05,870
who's reading?
Who's blue?

422
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,250
Blue.
Blue on the left.

423
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,440
Okay.
So how.

424
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,590
Yeah.
So it must've been the.

425
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,380
Hmm.
That's interesting.

426
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,600
Wait,
wait a minute.

427
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,300
All three at 10.
Nine for the first.

428
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,640
All three had 10.
Eight for the second,

429
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,620
right.
That makes sense.

430
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,750
And all three at 10.
Nine for the third and for the fourth.

431
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,240
So does that make it a draw?
No,

432
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,770
that means holly was ahead.
Well how do they judge the fourth and

433
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,490
then the fifth?
And she would say head in the fourth.

434
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,580
So holly was ahead by one point,
right?

435
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,633
Yep.
Yep.

436
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,490
Even though she'd won three rounds.
Yes.

437
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:40,200
I mean,
if she would have won that round,

438
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:42,140
it would have been a draw I guess.
Wow.

439
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,210
She was.
She wasn't really willing around right

440
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,960
there.
I'm surprised that they all gave him a

441
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,860
10.
Eight.

442
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,530
That's good.
That's very good.

443
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,480
Good to hear.
Their name is Marcos for solids.

444
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:54,280
Good job.
That was a.

445
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,310
That was a real tenant.
That's how it should look.

446
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,960
Someone takes you down and beat the shit
out of you.

447
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,930
But just what an what a finish.
That was.

448
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:04,930
What was amazing about it and you know
holly fought smart.

449
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:08,050
She used that side kick a lot.
She's so good with her movement.

450
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,300
She caught me with a lot of punches to
man,

451
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,400
but she wasn't.
She wasn't going after her.

452
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,620
She would catch her with punches and
stay on the outside.

453
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,560
She was fighting a smart fight and she
got taken down.

454
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:20,230
She got dominated on the ground by
Meesha and that's when I was like,

455
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:21,090
wow,
me,

456
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,710
she's fucking top game is solid as a
rock.

457
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,540
Like her control is excellent and her,
she's fucking strong man.

458
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,200
She's drunk because holly strong.
Holly Holm is strong.

459
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,160
I was really impressed with their ground
and pound really impressed with our top

460
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,990
game.
But then you know what man,

461
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:40,510
the next round,
Holly Holm got right back on her fucking

462
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,110
bicycle and,
and,

463
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,010
and probably in everyone's eyes when
that round,

464
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,350
right.
All those judges eyes to me.

465
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,184
It was a,

466
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,270
if that would have wanted a decision,
now I would've given it to holly just

467
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,720
based on,
uh,

468
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,420
you know,
depending upon how that no real damage.

469
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,180
She never knocked me down.
She never hurt me shit.

470
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,650
Right.
That was the shepherd.

471
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,070
Her never heard her.
She tagged her a couple times where,

472
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:04,780
you know,
she snapped her head back a little bit,

473
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:08,260
but it wasn't anything like what she was
legs giving out.

474
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,500
No.
So it,

475
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,410
it was,
it was about to be a semi boring

476
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,450
decision overall.
Like who would want to watch that fight

477
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:17,800
again?
The second round is kind of cool.

478
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,140
It was going to be one of those fights,
but just like that,

479
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,300
she turned it into one of the greatest
fights ever.

480
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,330
Amazing comeback that last second.
That's like a grand slam and the bottom

481
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:30,730
of the ninth and the scramble to get to
the back,

482
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,580
her scramble,
the way she held on as Hollywood kept

483
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:35,230
moving and changing and adjusting.

484
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,230
She kept holding on.
Then finally the Hail Mary Hollie tries

485
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,710
to flip her over the top and she hangs
on,

486
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,520
hangs onto the choke and sinks it in and
it gets the hooks in and,

487
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,530
and when holly goes to sleep,
punching in the air,

488
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,440
you know those old nfl films,
like when you watch those superbowl from

489
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:56,980
1978 or something to have that voice and
they're together.

490
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,230
They're doing the slow mo and these all
these old,

491
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,030
you know,
memorable place like epic plays in 20

492
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,920
years.
When they look back at that and they

493
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:10,390
have some old like Orson Welles type a
narrator talking about,

494
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,500
about going through all that transition.
There was a lot of drama going on there,

495
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,150
man.
She didn't just take her back and choke

496
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,500
her.
There was a lot of shit.

497
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:24,160
There was a lot of shit to handle what's
going on and watch what's happening.

498
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,640
It was incredible to.
We're naked chokes.

499
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,990
The scrambled though to scramble was
just so epic because the drama building

500
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:32,651
up,
he.

501
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,960
She's down on the cards.
Most likely.

502
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,580
You can't watch that were watched?
No,

503
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:38,510
we can never.
Once she down on the car,

504
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:43,511
it's most likely she's about to.
She's about to lose a decision probably.

505
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
Oh my God.
She's got ahold of her.

506
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,600
Oh my God.
She's on her back.

507
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,830
Oh my God.
She got that job,

508
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,690
kept going and going back and then when
holly went to sleep,

509
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,900
it was like she didn't even tap.
She went out.

510
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,900
She went out punching.
She was throwing punches.

511
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:02,650
When she went out to your bad ass,
you have to be to go out throwing

512
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:04,500
punches.
Oh,

513
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,830
bad ass.
That girl is.

514
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,430
She went out.
She went out like throwing punches.

515
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,000
She didn't want to tap.
Fuck.

516
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:13,870
That was a good fight.

517
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,480
Woo.
It's amazing.

518
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,310
Back the best fight of the night.
That was that the biggest UFC ever.

519
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,410
I mean,
Jesus.

520
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:23,950
That was the biggest UFC ever.
I mean,

521
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,890
I would sat that night,
but he's not the fight of the night.

522
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,890
It's the same.
The both equally insane.

523
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,460
There's no like one better finale or one
better.

524
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:37,180
Uh,
and I think the conor fight was more

525
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:40,030
excited because all the way through that
was a lot of damage going on.

526
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:42,520
There was a lot of fire going on with
the holly fight.

527
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,890
There was a lot of dancing around taking
shots.

528
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:45,990
I was a lot of,
you know,

529
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,790
definitely it was,
there was a lot less action overall.

530
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,080
Yeah.
But if you compress those,

531
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:54,260
if you take out a couple of those rounds
and compress it all into one round,

532
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,820
then yeah,
I see.

533
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,600
I don't think you got to be pleased by
it through the whole thing.

534
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,860
I think what's most important is that
after it ends you have some definitive

535
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:07,190
conclusion and if it takes a while to
get that definitive conclusion,

536
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,250
I mean it's going to fly.
Fighters are tactical.

537
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,060
You're right.
But it was because of that that made the

538
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,750
end so good.
Without that.

539
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,520
Then it wouldn't have been so juicy at
the end.

540
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,620
Exactly.
Because she had gone through the full

541
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:21,380
five or when they were in the fifth
round and there was like,

542
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,930
we've got to see.
She's trying things and not working.

543
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,730
She tries this.
It works really good.

544
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,710
Okay.
Now how he's trying this that's working

545
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:28,430
meets is trying that.

546
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,630
That's not working.
Okay.

547
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,200
Now she's started to kick.
When she got,

548
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,080
she got to do something different to get
close to her.

549
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,330
How's she going to figure it out?
Down on the score.

550
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,560
Shoots for the fucking take down.
Grabs a hold of her kitchen.

551
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,050
Chokes or unconscious.
Oh my God.

552
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,250
Because yeah,
you wouldn't have been that low from

553
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:44,980
that stuff.
Yeah.

554
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,150
To the place went insane.
It was insane.

555
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:51,630
It was so epic.
Then Dalmatia Tate,

556
00:24:51,631 --> 00:24:52,910
man.
God Damn.

557
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,340
She was so happy.
She's so nice.

558
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,950
You know?
She's such a like her and holly.

559
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:02,951
They're both so nice.
It's so nice to see nice people like

560
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:07,400
that do really well in such a brutal
savage sport.

561
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,530
You know?
She's really nice.

562
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:11,510
Like when have you ever use or Misha
Tate's?

563
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:14,450
Never like raised her voice at anybody.
She never yelled at anybody.

564
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:18,200
She's like real friendly.
She's real sweet to see her.

565
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,910
The UFC bantamweight champion.
I was like,

566
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:22,070
wow,
this is crazy.

567
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,090
Well performance.
I think holly is a little bit nicer

568
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,440
though.
She's super nice.

569
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,190
She seems like there's some country like
wife.

570
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,470
You know what I mean?
She's the preacher's daughter.

571
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,230
She really did.
She really is.

572
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,800
She really is.
Wow.

573
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,980
And she's tough as fuck,
dude.

574
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:44,120
She went out punching a cold.
She was like throwing punches.

575
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,450
She just wants to get the interposed.
She just want her to get back into it.

576
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,653
She was like,
when do you.

577
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,720
She just wants to get back in.
I know what I loved about the preflight

578
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,620
speech when she was talking about the
fight itself,

579
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,490
she was like,
you know what?

580
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:57,200
Rhonda is going to be out for awhile.
She was,

581
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,780
I'm not fighting for money.
I'm not fighting for fame.

582
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,630
I want the action.
I want to fight like,

583
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,130
Whoa,
Whoa,

584
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,100
wild with you.

585
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,010
That's how you got to think.
If you want to be great,

586
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,480
right?
It's something to focus on.

587
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:11,240
Yeah.
If you want to be a holly Holm,

588
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,860
I guess you have to be like that.
We want to be a 19 time world's women

589
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:19,490
boxing champion.
You've got to be a crazy motivated

590
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:20,720
person.
She's got to.

591
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,670
She's got to fall in love with Jujitsu
though,

592
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,830
because she's not the biggest fan of Jiu
Jitsu.

593
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:27,830
She really needs that.
You had said before that I know that.

594
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:30,530
I know that's hard to swallow,
you know,

595
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:34,550
but you got to,
you can't be one of those fighters that.

596
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,010
And there's a bunch of them out there,
uh,

597
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,110
that uh,
they didn't really want to get

598
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:41,710
offensively good at Jujitsu.
They didn't really have a,

599
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,860
they weren't attracted to passing the
garden,

600
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,160
taking

601
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,470
the back and choke and PPI.
There's a lot of wrestlers out there

602
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:51,240
that just wanted to keep it on the feet,
do a little to defense and if you have

603
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,550
to take them down,
stay in half guard and pound them out

604
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,470
and just keep it simple and keep it like
that.

605
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,590
You know,
if,

606
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,460
um,
there's a lot of wrestlers like that.

607
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,870
Now that she's the restaurant,
they're strikers.

608
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,350
They're strikers like that too.
There's been a quite a few throughout

609
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,870
the years,
champions that didn't really want to

610
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:09,180
work on their Jujitsu the right way,
the right way,

611
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:12,530
which is sparring with everybody and not
picking her up sparring upon.

612
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,150
And just jumping into the fire,
that's how in O'connor's good,

613
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,580
because connor does that and he's going
to get way better.

614
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:20,280
He's actually good at Jujitsu.
Just nate is a lot better,

615
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:25,281
but I think holly needs to have somehow,
somehow it needs to happen.

616
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,290
I don't know how,
but she needs to fall in love with

617
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:33,150
Jujitsu in and uh,
because I think that's where people

618
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,150
know.
I mean that,

619
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,810
that's the spot we were already.
We haven't really seen her on her back.

620
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,840
We haven't seen a reactive Jujitsu now
we have and Mischa just exposed her and

621
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:45,360
she needs to take that.
She needs to take care of that and fall

622
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,610
in love with Jujitsu and start getting
on Instagram,

623
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:48,950
taking pictures with her.
Gee,

624
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,540
you know what I mean?
And she's got a blue belt and be all

625
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:53,550
happy.
She's got to be really happy about it

626
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:55,860
because she needs a,
there's a,

627
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,600
there's a hole right there.
And that's where people are going to try

628
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:59,640
to take her.
She's not that hard to take down.

629
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,500
After all,
I thought she'd be harder to take down,

630
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,210
but you know me.
She took her down.

631
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,990
Well,
Misha mixes up or take Dante.

632
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,093
She goes to

633
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,600
up and she goes down,
download.

634
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,110
Whereas Ronda is like upper body clench.
She's really an upper body clench,

635
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:15,820
so all holly had to do also Rondon.
That fight was so insanely aggressive.

636
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,570
Her charging after made it so much
easier for counters.

637
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,720
Misha was super crafty.
She liked very patient,

638
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,280
very patient,
varied.

639
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:27,060
Her movement varied or timing didn't do
any like,

640
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,070
like she didn't continue any patterns
with this.

641
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Her stand up.
She moved around a lot and she did a lot

642
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:36,010
of Juke in and a lot of.
She did a lot of different stuff.

643
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,920
Stayed on the outside,
made holly come after her.

644
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,970
Like if you,
if you're.

645
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,210
If you're a really good counter striker
like holly is for her,

646
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:45,550
the best thing is a Rhonda,
like someone's going to run at her.

647
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,340
The best thing is someone running out or
she's.

648
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,890
She's so fleet like her footwork,
so excellent.

649
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,360
She sold light on her feet that she's so
good at just sliding out of the way and

650
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:57,940
cracking you while you're coming in.
It's like one of the things she's best

651
00:28:57,941 --> 00:29:00,490
at.
So if you fight that,

652
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:03,180
we're against her.
That's the kind of fight that happens.

653
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:04,450
You'll look,
she looks like a master,

654
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,310
but if you look at her fight in the very
first UFC fight with Raquel Pennington,

655
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,780
she wanted a split decision.
Yeah.

656
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,000
You know,
and that was a fight where raquel fought

657
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,380
more cautious,
a little smarter,

658
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:17,830
new new holly's background coming in,
you know,

659
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,400
if you don't like,
if you don't engage with her.

660
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,230
It's like,
remember when Anderson was in,

661
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:26,620
his prime guys came after him.
He just butchered him.

662
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,890
But if guys hung back,
sometimes the fight was boring,

663
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,270
right?
Like,

664
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:32,500
um,
talus latest.

665
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,050
Remember tonsillitis,
like hung back and he kind of waited for

666
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,903
Anderson.

667
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,920
Same thing with Patrick.
Patrick de hung back,

668
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,360
he just fought smart.
He's like,

669
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,040
I'm going to charge it,
run it in anything.

670
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:42,401
Come,
come,

671
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:43,570
get me,
come get me.

672
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,720
And coach k like,
oh,

673
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:47,860
he's had a big right hand.
So everybody had to be real careful.

674
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,420
You always have to be careful because a
guy,

675
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,550
if you're coming at him,
he could always catch you.

676
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:53,230
And if a guy like [inaudible] catches
you,

677
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,450
he just had that stupid power in his
hand.

678
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:57,490
He could just knock.
He knocked out Tito at two.

679
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:58,570
Oh five.
Do you remember that?

680
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,010
He knocked him out down,
knocked him down to take a shot.

681
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,890
But he knocked him down at two.
Oh five.

682
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,520
And he fights it one 70.
No,

683
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,150
no.
I mean Patrick Ho taken crack.

684
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,790
So Anderson never want Patrick Blues
Neon.

685
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:13,620
That fight.
Yeah.

686
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,640
He like went to throw a kick and his
knee just gave out.

687
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,560
It's really exploded.
Yeah.

688
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:21,840
He fought a very smart fight to.
And that's that stain when you,

689
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,010
you find a killer counter striker like
that.

690
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,080
The big thing is like,
let them lead.

691
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,610
They don't,
they don't want to lead.

692
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,220
Make it a boring fight.
Let it be boring.

693
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,770
Move around,
be patient me.

694
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:33,910
She did everything right,
man.

695
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,140
It's amazing.
Rhonda.

696
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,910
Meesha three would be nice,
right?

697
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,170
That's probably what it's going to
happen.

698
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,500
It's probably what's going to happen
next according to what I've read on the

699
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:44,480
Internet because I have here,
I wonder what Rhonda would want.

700
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,630
Would she want to.
She probably a rematch with her after a

701
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:53,020
loss or a title shot if I was her
thought it was a tough choice.

702
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:56,290
Rather if I was her,
if I was a tough choice,

703
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:56,901
right?
Boy,

704
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:57,734
uh,
can be her.

705
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,200
If I was her,
honestly I would probably,

706
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,250
I would imagine if I was her,
I'd want to avenge the loss because

707
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,153
Hollywood,
uh,

708
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,560
her first loss and she doesn't feel like
she did her best and I'm fight and that

709
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:14,080
fight was just too much going on.

710
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,960
If you hear her talk about it,
it was like there was just overwhelmed

711
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,900
with obligations and shit and just
fought wrong.

712
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,300
Just didn't,
didn't fight correctly.

713
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,040
Just had real problems going into that.
And then you have like her approach like

714
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,220
kitten in Holly's face the way in trying
to make it real emotional,

715
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,740
you know,
you fake ass bitch and all that stuff.

716
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,680
And then all that emotions when she
fought in the ranks just running after

717
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:40,420
holly and holly just fall like a master,
that was one of the best performances

718
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,890
you'll ever see of a striker and the
gating a person's aggression.

719
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,370
Like she just did it so brilliantly.
Cash.

720
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,780
No,
with elbows coming in,

721
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,600
catching it with straight lefts.
And then that fucking set up for the

722
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:57,040
head kick when Rhonda is all stumbling
and she just catches her with that head

723
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,920
kick him.
And just a spectacular mixed martial

724
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:01,720
arts performance overall.

725
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,440
Like one of the best,
like title winning efforts in any weight

726
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:09,640
class as far as like a sheer domination.
It's right up there with Tj dillashaw

727
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:12,760
Hanan Barao one but more,
probably more scary.

728
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:17,200
And it's one of the most spectacular
highlight clips ever where she's getting

729
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,034
clipped.
Yup.

730
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,210
Wow.
Amazing.

731
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,340
Amazing.
It's like she's a bad ass,

732
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,500
you know.
So what I think about holly is,

733
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,640
you know,
holly get back on track and uh,

734
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,970
I,
I really hope that she takes that advice

735
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:30,520
that you just gave.
I think that'd be real smart.

736
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,280
You've got to somehow fall in love and
not fight it no more.

737
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,660
Well,
I don't know if she fights it.

738
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,310
I don't know what the deal is.
Who knows?

739
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,850
She's just so good at kickboxing.
I think she just wants to stay sharp in

740
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,690
that and that's what she wants to do to
girls because she feels like she has

741
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:47,210
this big advantage of them against them
in that.

742
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,200
But obviously she needs a little work on
it and I think she'll get better.

743
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:51,921
Man.
She,

744
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:53,540
she can,
she can still improve,

745
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,660
you know,
and I think maybe there's also the

746
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:59,210
overwhelming pressure that must come
from being a champ,

747
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,660
like that experience probably takes a
while to learn how to navigate it.

748
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,640
I hope I'm wrong and she's already in
love with it.

749
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,240
That would be awesome if I was wrong,
you know,

750
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,970
I'm rooting for Holly.
I like holly.

751
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:08,830
I think.
Holly,

752
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,610
could you not agree with a course?
How could I not like it?

753
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,220
I'm just being real.
I'm sorry if that hurts anybody.

754
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:14,610
Three.
No,

755
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:14,931
no,
no.

756
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,750
I think what you're saying is important
and I hope and I hope that I'm wrong.

757
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,200
I hope that you have no idea.
She's totally into it.

758
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:21,950
She's been.
She just hasn't worked on it,

759
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:26,570
that loan or whatever what I'm saying,
but I would love to see Holly Hall with

760
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,260
an aggressive offer back and dangerous
offer back.

761
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:32,330
There's no reason why she couldn't be.
She's super athletic.

762
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:37,331
She has a crazy work ethic,
a car by her designer and I'm Brendan

763
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:39,794
batch.

764
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,310
There was a fight on the undercard
batches,

765
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,940
a super talented guy,
man,

766
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:47,450
super talented karate guy,
but a bar does.

767
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,120
Auto was able to take him down.
He didn't have any answers off his back.

768
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,110
It's like one of those examples of a guy
who's a really talented striker where

769
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:57,720
you're not getting to see the full
extent of his talent because he has a

770
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:01,170
difficult time fighting off his back and
has a difficult time keeping guys from

771
00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:02,780
taking them down.
So just,

772
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,400
you know,
he's guys are figuring that out with him

773
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:09,270
and a couple guys have dominated him on
the ground and it's just unfortunate

774
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:11,610
because he's so talented with his
striking.

775
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,950
Like when you see a guy like that,
you just want to go,

776
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,500
man,
if you could figure out a way to find

777
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:19,710
balance in your skill set,
how good would he be?

778
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,630
You know,
he's so good standing up,

779
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,150
but by her does auto man.
My God,

780
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:27,690
that guy hits hard.
He's got one of those weird punching

781
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:31,320
power bodies like you,
like make familiar with him.

782
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,100
He's from Afghanistan who was born in
Afghanistan and grew up in Holland I

783
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:35,960
think.
Um,

784
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,700
but he is a,
I want to say he did.

785
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,740
I don't think he.
Who did he trained with?

786
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,593
Um.

787
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,980
Oh,
Greg Jackson,

788
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,460
who was at Greg Jackson's camp for this,
but he's been out for like 800 days.

789
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,710
He had some serious injuries,
both the rooms almost three years.

790
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,460
Two and A.
Yeah,

791
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,060
a little bit more than two years.
He had both his Labor rooms had to be

792
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:00,070
operated on and broke his hand fucked
up.

793
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,410
Which one's the labor room and say your
shoulder.

794
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,780
Oh Shit.
He had a bunch of shit operated on.

795
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,190
And so he was out for a long time.
So to see him come back and see,

796
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,620
like in the beginning you see them on
his back and he tries to,

797
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,850
he almost catches a triangle who's
throws up his legs and you know,

798
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,940
if someone who had a really good
triangle,

799
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,690
nate,
nate was in that same position,

800
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:21,340
he would got it.
You've got the triangle for sure.

801
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:24,940
I mean it was all there or at least he
would have secured it and by her desire

802
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:27,430
with how to defend it,
but he couldn't secure it and I was

803
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:28,001
like,
man,

804
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,500
that's just.
It was right there.

805
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,160
I out of the leg over the other.
Like here it was over like this.

806
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,860
There wasn't that much resistance.
I grab your fucking ankle,

807
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:38,010
lock that in like what he do and he just
didn't.

808
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,220
And then you see them for the rest of
the fight was having a real hard time

809
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:44,190
fighting off his back.
We see a guy that's good.

810
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:45,780
He's so talented standing up,
man.

811
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:48,300
You watch them throw knees and punches
you like Jesus.

812
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,270
This could be,
this kid could be a fucking force.

813
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,080
She's got to really Polish up that
ground game and especially off of his

814
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,380
back.
No,

815
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,650
this is a crazy sport,
man.

816
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,960
You can't just have one way to go
anymore.

817
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,330
You got to have the whole thing.
You can't.

818
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,570
There's,
there's very few people that are going

819
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:09,720
to exist in this sport at the upper
echelons with just one way to go.

820
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,570
You know,
one of the things that's so scary about

821
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:17,571
a guy like nate that nate's needs.
Boxing is just as good as his Jujitsu.

822
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,070
You know,
his.

823
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,940
And sometimes you don't see the Jujitsu
that much because he's so confident as

824
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,390
boxing and he throws down with guys,
but guys go to the ground with them.

825
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:30,510
I mean,
he's choked out some good dude's fucking

826
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,373
good.

827
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,350
You've got to have some serious
finishing power on the ground.

828
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:35,850
Whether it's on your back.
Are you on top?

829
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:38,250
You have,
at least with you on top,

830
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:41,520
you'd better have finishing.
Maybe you just use your bottom game for

831
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:42,840
sweeps.
There's nothing wrong with that.

832
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,010
Uh,
you don't,

833
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,960
you don't have to finish the guy off
your back.

834
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,090
But it's always good.
It,

835
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:48,680
it's better.
If you could find it,

836
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,060
if you're known to finish people off
your back,

837
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,490
that's anytime I roll with anybody
that's even a purple belt,

838
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,240
who his specialty is finishing people
off his back end.

839
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:02,170
If there's always those students.
When I'm on a roll,

840
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,000
Jeremiah,
I almost rather have the mounting me

841
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,153
hang up.
I ended up in,

842
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,280
has got him a fuck.
That mount made easier to get out of the

843
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:12,660
mountain.
It is his rubber guard.

844
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,640
Serious craze.
And there's few guys like that,

845
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:16,610
like a Boogie at anytime.

846
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,360
Boogie put me in his garden.
I go right to the mountain.

847
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,020
I gotta check out this week.
You're a bad motherfucker

848
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,250
go crazy because that goes against
conventional.

849
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,380
Oh yeah.
But uh,

850
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,700
my,
I don't have the greatest,

851
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:30,330
the greatest posture in the world.
And My,

852
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,720
my lower back's all fucked up so I don't
try to posture out of shit.

853
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,730
I just,
I go with everything man.

854
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,970
Like you want to go that way?
Let's go and let me see if I could hold

855
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:40,930
on and get a little clench and then go
back this way.

856
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,450
You know,
I don't,

857
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,350
I don't.
I'm too old to a forced my way through

858
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:49,050
anything.
That's probably the smart way to do it

859
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:49,884
though,
right?

860
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,120
That's my Jujitsu is becoming very
survival now.

861
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:55,870
My guys are fucking me up.
Now.

862
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,610
There's this phase where I'm getting
tapped out all the goddamn time.

863
00:37:59,611 --> 00:37:59,911
Now,
man,

864
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,780
am I.
If I'm the only way I can cap out

865
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:08,190
certain purple belts as if I have gas.
If I'm tired and I take around with one

866
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:10,510
of my purple belts,
I'll be fucking on,

867
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,650
on a survival mode the whole time,
man.

868
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,860
My guys are coming with fire now.
Throwing leg locks.

869
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,240
You leave your feet out.
Damn.

870
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,610
Uh,
it's,

871
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,810
it's pretty crazy not getting any leg
injuries.

872
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,250
No,
no,

873
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,350
no,
no.

874
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,370
Just my back.
Finally getting a district meeting.

875
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,740
Other people in class getting any knee
injuries or anything?

876
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,340
No,
no.

877
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,730
It's a myth.
It's a myth that you hurt your arm or

878
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:34,810
your shoulder at the same rate.
You'll hurt your knee.

879
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:37,060
We do leg locks all the goddamn time.

880
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,040
That's so interesting because I was
always.

881
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,900
The word planning has always been that
way.

882
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,340
We never banned reaping.
We never,

883
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:46,180
I never frowned upon heel hooks.
I personally never got really heavy on

884
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:48,730
heel hooks.
I was always heavy on lead compressions,

885
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,930
a different style leg lock.
I was always doing those.

886
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,480
Not really.
He'll hook so much.

887
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,300
Uh,
but uh,

888
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,350
we've always had heel hook masters.
No,

889
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,500
I wouldn't,
I probably wouldn't have asked that if

890
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:01,420
that wasn't something that comes up all
the time.

891
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,340
People talk about Lego blocks,
you know,

892
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,680
I kind of know the answer because if it
was,

893
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:07,070
I would've heard about it that you would
have told me.

894
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,800
I think it's a myth that leg locks are
when we were brought up in Jujitsu,

895
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,230
the whole Brazilian Jiu Jitsu community
band,

896
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,990
heel hooks and,
and frowned upon them.

897
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:19,090
And,
and do you remember that time you were

898
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:22,600
at a tournament and they started booing
and screaming when you went for guy's

899
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:22,930
leg?

900
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,220
Yes.
When I first,

901
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,180
during my white belt years and into my
blue belt years,

902
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,350
I saw Ken shamrock instructional.
He's wearing jeans and shit and it's got

903
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:34,760
no shirt.
He was wearing jeans and he's like small

904
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,360
little gentleman.
He's got this Japanese guy and he's

905
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,240
doing this.
Told from the top,

906
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:42,910
from top half,
and I was always playing half garlic

907
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:45,880
right away as a white belt because
that's like the worst guard every

908
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,890
quarter guard.
I mean it doesn't get any worse than

909
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:49,540
that.
Anything worse as you got your guard

910
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,940
pass.
So I was always playing the worst shit

911
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,790
because I was small and weak.
But uh,

912
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,310
um,
you would go up to toe holt?

913
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,740
Yeah,
I learned from Ken shamrock started

914
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:05,380
going after toehold and I got pretty
good at them.

915
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,300
I was tapping motherfuckers with them
and I,

916
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,130
I did this tournament.
It was the first Pan Am's and it was an

917
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,360
la and Elsa Gundo.

918
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,290
Nineteen 96 or 97.
The first pan ams I went for a toehold

919
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,740
and there was about $500 Brazilians that
they shipped in because it was the first

920
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,900
Pan Am's and there was like this big
retreat and they took me.

921
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,720
They had them all in this,
this hotel right down the street from

922
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:31,000
the gym.
And it was man and shit.

923
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,830
I'll never forget that.
And this.

924
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,390
We're an Elsa Gundo la and there was 500
Brazilians that got shipped in for the

925
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:41,890
Pan Ams and of course they dominated and
they killed everybody in Jujitsu,

926
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,800
but I did Russell,
Brazilian and I put them in a toll.

927
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:47,950
Then as soon as I put them in the toll,
the whole crowd went nuts.

928
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,120
It was a riot.
Almost happened was just a riot.

929
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,440
I Dunno what,
what stopped them,

930
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:57,160
but they were throwing shoes at the math
that were throwing bottles at,

931
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,300
at the,
uh,

932
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,210
water bottles at me and I was sitting
there holding a toehold and everyone's

933
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,570
screaming and under,
I forget Johnny Machado comes running

934
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:07,690
like slow motion and he slacked because
you got to let it go,

935
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,680
let it go.

936
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,580
And I was like,
fuck.

937
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:12,430
And I let it go and then the guy beat me
on points,

938
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,480
but I'm.
So John Machado slid in and told you,

939
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:17,110
you gotta let it go.
Because everybody was going crazy.

940
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:19,450
Everyone was gone crazy.
Or let him contact the legs.

941
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:21,100
But you weren't supposed to tie.
It was dirty.

942
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,160
It was dirty back then.
And then in the parking lot like that,

943
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,560
that mean Joe Green commercial,
remember that old,

944
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:29,020
mean Joe Green commercial where he's
drinking a coke and there's like a

945
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:30,440
little kid.
Well,

946
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,490
I felt like a little kid because I ran
into Eric Paulson in the parking lot and

947
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:37,280
he was getting the same reaction when he
was gone for like blocks and he was like

948
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:39,830
a blue belt at the time and he,
he and uh,

949
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,650
I think we're the same age,
but for some reason I felt always felt

950
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:44,810
like a little kid and he had all this
knowledge.

951
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,110
He was a blue belt in Jujitsu,
buddy,

952
00:41:46,111 --> 00:41:48,040
uh,
trained in Japan and fought and shooto

953
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,790
and shit.
He was already like a professional

954
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:53,960
fighter and an expert at leg locks who
just got into Jujitsu.

955
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,940
So he's competing,
competing on a blue belt.

956
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,380
Fucking everybody up,
put leg locks,

957
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,670
right?
Is there a Paulson,

958
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,880
Paulson in 24.
And we're in the parking lot and he

959
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:03,710
showed me this leg lock and he goes,
listen,

960
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,720
check this out man.
Don't forget this.

961
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,920
Because he,
he,

962
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,660
he saw a little of him in me because I
was going for a toll because I'll fuck,

963
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:14,420
look at that dude.
He's getting a lot of heat to because

964
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:17,660
he's going for a leg lock so right away.
But it was totally legal.

965
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:20,300
That's what's crazy.
You could have tapped the guy out and it

966
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,850
would have been illegal.
I don't know.

967
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,720
I don't remember what the rule set.

968
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,830
I don't remember.
But.

969
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:27,570
So my thought,
I thought they were legal and maybe it's

970
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,140
illegal,
but even if it was illegal,

971
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:32,590
the crowd erupted.
The Brazilians with nuts and throwing

972
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,600
shoes and screaming and shit for some,
some belt ranks.

973
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,500
Right?
Like in some tournaments.

974
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,750
Yeah.
Uh,

975
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,780
you can do heal hooks,
gracie nationals and Gracie worlds.

976
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,300
You can do heal hooks at purple belt and
above.

977
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,970
White Belt and blue belt.
No heel hooks.

978
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,120
You can do straight ankle and knee bars
at blue enough.

979
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,730
No legs at all at white,
zero legs at White,

980
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,090
straight ankle locks,
knee bars,

981
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,260
leg compression at blue.
And then they allow heel hooks for

982
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:05,810
reaping everything purple belt on.
Those are the best rules.

983
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,730
I love those ones.
You don't need heel hooks for blue

984
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,260
belts,
but like Naga,

985
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,480
they let everybody,
he'll hook so,

986
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,070
and it's not this like,
you know,

987
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,340
big epidemic going on where people are
just getting,

988
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:19,460
their knees is ripped out to not at any
10th planet school.

989
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,470
Every now and then someone does get a
knee injury,

990
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,810
just like they do get an arm injury or
shoulder injury.

991
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,830
Sometimes people get put on a heel hook
and a there any up sometimes,

992
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:30,110
but sometimes it happens with the arm at
the same rate.

993
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,500
We do heal hooks all the time.
No one's getting every now and then

994
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:35,390
someone gets hurt,
but it's just part of the gang,

995
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,060
but it's every now and then someone gets
hurt from everything.

996
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:38,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

997
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:42,590
It's not know if people were get trust
me as a businessman,

998
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,780
if,
if,

999
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,060
if I saw that I'm walking around every
night and I'm looking at what's going

1000
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:48,970
on,
I know exactly how my.

1001
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,220
I know who's playing what and what
everyone's different style,

1002
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,500
you know,
especially like the purple belt level.

1003
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:54,940
I,
I,

1004
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,050
I pretty much know where they're coming
from.

1005
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,230
No one's getting hurt.
Everyone's doing the hawks and you just

1006
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,630
you a man.

1007
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,660
It's a different mother fucking world
when you're going against leg lock

1008
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:13,250
experts to know Jujitsu,
like guys like Eddie Cummings and Gary

1009
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:18,251
tone and black belt in Jujitsu that are
fucking hyper super ultra leg lucky.

1010
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,640
Holy Shit.
You better watch Yo Shit.

1011
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,170
So if you are not training,
leg locks,

1012
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,780
leg locks when everything goes when it's
submission only when there's not all

1013
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:33,300
these stupid rules when dangerous,
when it's just like that Jujitsu that

1014
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:36,300
you fell in love with.
Everybody falls in love with the Jujitsu

1015
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:39,630
that they walk into their Dojo and then
they train for the first day and they're

1016
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,940
fucking love it.
They love it and they fell.

1017
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:47,070
They fell in love with what happened and
what goes on.

1018
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:49,680
Every night in that class,
there's no points.

1019
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,110
People are just rolling in there trying
to get the submission.

1020
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,560
That's what you fall in love with.
What you see at a tournament that's on

1021
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,190
what you fall in love.

1022
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,630
No one goes to what you just to
tournament for the first fucking time

1023
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,940
and I'm going to fuck it.
I love this.

1024
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:03,320
I'm going to do this.
They fucking run the garden.

1025
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,210
That's the that.
That's how you turn people off to

1026
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:09,090
Jujitsu.
The first experience is appoints

1027
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,640
tournament where there's 12 matches
going on at the same time.

1028
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,180
We'll see how long that lasts.
People that like Jujitsu can't even hang

1029
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,670
well,
especially when it's with the game.

1030
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,030
Exactly.
They'll,

1031
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,220
they'll be like,
fuck this.

1032
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:23,220
They're playing tug of war and Jacques
thinks it's boring.

1033
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:23,851
Yeah,
yeah,

1034
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:24,830
exactly.
John.

1035
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:28,170
John is so boring,
so

1036
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,970
guys are just trying to get advantages
and trying to like just score a point

1037
00:45:31,971 --> 00:45:34,790
and hold on.
I think the rules that you've set up for

1038
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:38,450
Ebi are the best rules.
They're the rules because you go a

1039
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:39,890
certain amount of time.
What is it?

1040
00:45:39,891 --> 00:45:40,724
Ten minutes,

1041
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,840
10 minute match.
16 Man Tournament,

1042
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,460
a 10 minute matches with overtime.
If there was no points,

1043
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,760
no advantages.
All submission.

1044
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,040
Only like you'd have to get the
submission,

1045
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:50,874
you know?
Yeah.

1046
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:54,120
What's really interesting is you've got
this idea that uh,

1047
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,860
you know,
until I saw it,

1048
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:57,660
I was not sure what to think of it.
I was like,

1049
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,080
all right.
I don't know.

1050
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:01,260
I don't know how it was going to do this
the other time.

1051
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,850
Over time.
Sounds crazy.

1052
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,790
It sounds crazy,
but in practice it's the best thing.

1053
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,480
Since if you watch a Jujitsu match,
one of the things that happens if you're

1054
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:12,510
a casual observer,
if you watch like a Marcello Garcia,

1055
00:46:12,511 --> 00:46:14,700
some guy just attacks and strangle
somebody like,

1056
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:16,080
Whoa,
that was amazing.

1057
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,400
I.
That guy's awesome.

1058
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,360
Like I've showed some people that don't
ever do Jujitsu.

1059
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,660
I showed them Marcello Garcia match and
you watch him choke somebody and it's so

1060
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:27,420
spectacular to watch because his
movements are so impressive.

1061
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:29,700
There's whole fast and lethal,
you know,

1062
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,000
but a lot of Jujitsu matches will end in
nothing.

1063
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,340
Some guy gets on top and then he
reverses the guy.

1064
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,660
Guy Used to go.
It goes for a leg lock,

1065
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:38,580
he doesn't get it and God goes to choke.
He doesn't get it.

1066
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:41,700
The other guy winds up on top.
They reverse positions and you run out

1067
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:43,830
of time.
So when you run out of time like that,

1068
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:45,450
for a lot of people,
feel is inconclusive.

1069
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:50,340
So you decide you're going to have how
many different rounds of it did they do?

1070
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,170
Four rounds?
What's the most amount of rounds of

1071
00:46:53,171 --> 00:46:53,710
overtime?

1072
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,730
Well,
well first off,

1073
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,750
let me say that,
uh,

1074
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,140
you know,
if there's nothing wrong with the point

1075
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:02,420
game,
if you like the plank game,

1076
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,250
there's fucking nothing and you get
really good at it.

1077
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:05,990
You know what?
You're going to get good at passing and

1078
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:08,870
you're going to get good at sweeping and
you're wrestling is going to be good.

1079
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,790
It's just,
it's like a,

1080
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:13,730
it's like a little,
a subculture,

1081
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:16,190
cerebral type thing.
Positional thing,

1082
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,770
fucking nothing wrong with it.
You could use that as a training tool,

1083
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,240
like getting good at points tournaments
just because you're going to work on,

1084
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:25,980
you're passing and you're sweeping and
you might as well do points

1085
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,170
lethal with punches and you

1086
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,260
like to do that.
It's not a bad strategy.

1087
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:36,230
There's nothing wrong with that.
I'm not trying to stomp that out.

1088
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,020
I want to make it clear.
I'm not trying to compete against that

1089
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:40,830
at all.
It's beautiful thing.

1090
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,500
What you just,
you just.

1091
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,300
My goal has always been to put a to
create a Jujitsu show and I thought it

1092
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:51,560
would have been done by now and a lot of
people have tried to put a Jujitsu show

1093
00:47:51,561 --> 00:47:54,920
together on a.
it's so exciting that it can compete

1094
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:59,720
with on the overall entertainment value
with an nma show like your average mma

1095
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:01,330
show.
I go to just so,

1096
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,550
so beautiful.
We were obsessed with it.

1097
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,060
Why can't we see what's going wrong?
What's going on?

1098
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:09,980
There's been a professional submission
league,

1099
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,380
uh,
Hicks and even had a show there.

1100
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,360
Metamorris.
There's Polaris.

1101
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,550
I mean,
none of these shows,

1102
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,590
including mine,
including mine.

1103
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,750
None of these shows are making any
money.

1104
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,610
I haven't made any goddamn money with my
show.

1105
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,400
We all know that in the Jujitsu
community there's,

1106
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:27,920
there's no money there.
The shows fail constantly,

1107
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:30,200
but what is it about works of passion

1108
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,760
when,
when you go to an Ebi and you're in the

1109
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:37,420
audience that has an audience of Jujitsu
enthusiasts,

1110
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,820
like everybody is pumped.
They're all very excited to be there.

1111
00:48:40,821 --> 00:48:45,110
And there's a feeling of comradery in
that kind of a crowd that's very

1112
00:48:45,111 --> 00:48:48,260
different than a crowd that just comes
out to see like a UFC.

1113
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,250
Because a lot of people in the audience
at a UFC are gigantic fans.

1114
00:48:52,251 --> 00:48:55,040
A lot of them are fucking fanatical.
A lot of them are like you and me.

1115
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,650
A lot of them.
But there's a lot of other people that

1116
00:48:57,651 --> 00:49:00,050
are just there because it's an event.
There's a lot of other people that goes

1117
00:49:00,051 --> 00:49:02,120
there because it's a scene.
There's a lot of people that are on

1118
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:04,610
their phone and half the time they're
not even paying attention to the fights.

1119
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,300
This is that to add an Ebi,
because none of that shit.

1120
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,260
You freaks and everybody's clapping for
everything.

1121
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:15,650
Everybody knows when a heel hooks close.
Everybody knows when a choke is closed.

1122
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:17,210
Everybody knows.
Everybody knows what's going on.

1123
00:49:17,211 --> 00:49:19,070
Everybody knows when you guys sent.
She's up at triangle.

1124
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,440
Everybody knows.
So there's a beauty to that.

1125
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:23,540
But let me explain what you do because
we didn't finish it.

1126
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,600
You have overtime.
So when a fight goes to a draw,

1127
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,700
like at the end of it,
the time runs out,

1128
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:32,510
will you do is you take these guys and
you forced them into dangerous

1129
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,390
positions?
Yeah.

1130
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,730
So you force a guy on a guy's back with
over under and you start from there,

1131
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:39,200
you say ready,
go.

1132
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,930
And when you do that,
then the guy on the bottom tries to get

1133
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:43,760
out.
The guy in the top in the good position

1134
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:45,950
tries to finish.
If the guy finishes,

1135
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:48,770
you move on to the to another round and
the other guy tries to do it.

1136
00:49:48,771 --> 00:49:52,550
If he can't finish them,
the guy who finished one but he gets his

1137
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:57,470
chance in a bad position as well.
But if you have a stalemate over the

1138
00:49:57,471 --> 00:50:00,830
rounds of that,
you just count out the time who got out

1139
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,500
the quickest,
which guy escaped from the other guy's

1140
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,440
bad positions the quickest and you
calculate the time.

1141
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:11,530
Well traditionally it overtime with
Jujitsu matches it usually when it came

1142
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:14,990
down to wrestling who had the better
wrestling because if there would be

1143
00:50:14,991 --> 00:50:16,520
overtime,
there's no points or whatever.

1144
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:20,630
They go into overtime as three minute
overtime and overtime or sudden death,

1145
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:23,600
whoever gets the first points when it's
really gonna come down to who has the

1146
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:25,910
best Ruslan [inaudible],
they're all that overtime period.

1147
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,910
They both start on their feet.
So what's the most,

1148
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,430
the most important thing on your feet as
the wrestling here?

1149
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,600
That's gonna.
That's gonna.

1150
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,730
Determine overall the superior wrestlers
are going,

1151
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,580
uh,
that's always been the case really in

1152
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:41,510
all the overtime is it always comes down
to the wrestling generally.

1153
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,170
So I never really was a fan of that
because I've seen plenty of wrestlers

1154
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:47,690
and submission tournaments.
Not know anything about submitting,

1155
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,970
but they'll,
they'll run away with the gold medal

1156
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:51,020
just based on the wrestling.

1157
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,420
And that's a beautiful thing.
I wish I had that wrestling,

1158
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,570
but when it's a submission or a Jujitsu
tournament,

1159
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,900
we should,
the best Jujitsu should win.

1160
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:04,100
Not the best wrestler.
Arresting the best Jujitsu,

1161
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:06,620
the best,
the best it's submitting should win.

1162
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,870
Like a guy like Marcella Garcia should
win.

1163
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,980
The overtime's should make it so the
best wins who generally.

1164
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,220
So,
um,

1165
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,220
instead of starting on the feet,
my overtime rounds,

1166
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:20,240
we start in terrible positions like,
and it's like extra innings you get out

1167
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,750
of like if we were going to add it and
we went into overtime,

1168
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,440
you'd get a shot at my back and then I'd
get a shot at your bank.

1169
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,540
If you've finished me,
it's not over yet.

1170
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:31,730
I get a shot at gear back by finish you.
We die,

1171
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:35,210
we go an extra ending.
It's an extra round three MACs,

1172
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:37,310
three MACs,
but it could end that first round.

1173
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,240
It could end in the second round if it
goes all three rounds and we're still

1174
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:43,500
tie,
whether it's to submission,

1175
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,640
a submission each or an escape each and
another escape.

1176
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:51,641
And it's three total or all escapes.
We add all the combined escape and

1177
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:56,900
submission times together and whoever
had the quickest or shortest time winds.

1178
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:00,470
So it encourages that when you're on my
back that I'm not going to just sit

1179
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:04,220
there and just hold the choke out.
You should try to get the fuck out

1180
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,100
because if this goes to a triple
overtime,

1181
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,010
this is gonna matter.
So what it does is it opens up a

1182
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:11,690
submission for the gas because gas
escape.

1183
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,060
Yeah.
If it's.

1184
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,860
If it's confusing,
I'm just.

1185
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:17,140
You can go see it live on a.
You can see it on Youtube,

1186
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:19,060
right?
You UFC fight pass.

1187
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:21,130
You could see Ebi for.
That's where we're at.

1188
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,490
We're the ones that you have now.
Like there are some matches online.

1189
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,820
If somebody wanted to go and look at it
right now,

1190
00:52:24,821 --> 00:52:25,660
right?
Yes.

1191
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,310
And then the new one,
the next one,

1192
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,650
the absolute one.
This big crazy one is going to be in

1193
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,960
April.
In La Sunday,

1194
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:34,540
April 24th,
the fourth,

1195
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,030
April 24th.
And that's an absolute one,

1196
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:38,980
right?
Where you have all sorts of different

1197
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:41,650
weight classes represented.
Yes.

1198
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,510
I'm sorry.
It did.

1199
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,493
What are you doing?

1200
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,210
Make sure I've got the day right?
Yeah.

1201
00:52:46,211 --> 00:52:47,490
Sunday,
April Sunday,

1202
00:52:47,491 --> 00:52:50,490
April 24th.
Downtown la at the orpheum.

1203
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,580
It's going to be streamed live on UFC
fight pass.

1204
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,330
Orpheum is an awesome theater too.
If you've never been.

1205
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:59,690
It's one of those old classic downtown
La Theaters.

1206
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,120
It's probably be from the thirties or
something.

1207
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:03,440
Right?
Like when did they build that?

1208
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,180
I don't know.
It's awesome.

1209
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,570
It's awesome.
So to watch your show there,

1210
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,710
dude,
it's so cool.

1211
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:13,130
It's so cool to see it blowing up.
Like last time we were there,

1212
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:14,900
we're sitting in the audience like,
Whoa,

1213
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,120
this is amazing.

1214
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,000
It's crazy,
right?

1215
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,840
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

1216
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:24,130
And it's always been done without my
partner Victor Divey like he's the one

1217
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:25,110
guy,
he's the.

1218
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,620
I never wanted to be a promoter man.
That's not something I ever ever thought

1219
00:53:28,621 --> 00:53:31,590
I'd ever be like a promoter for a show.
That's not what I was trying to do.

1220
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,630
I was trying to come up with an idea
that like,

1221
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,390
give it to another promoter to do it,
like do this,

1222
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,030
but nobody.
Everyone thought it was the dumbest idea

1223
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:41,210
they thought I was losing my mind when
they put.

1224
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,200
They thought I smoked too much weed.
So then,

1225
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:44,250
uh,
I thought,

1226
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:46,350
you know what,
I'm going to try to do it.

1227
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:49,920
And Victor Vic.
But the problem was it was too much

1228
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:50,970
work.
I looked into it,

1229
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:52,330
I'm like,
I can't do this shit.

1230
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:53,164
I'm,
I was.

1231
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,600
But victor came in.
Victor Davi,

1232
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,200
he's the Spanish commentator for the
UFC.

1233
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,280
Came up to me and he said,
hey,

1234
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,480
listen,
let me do all the work years.

1235
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:02,720
It'll be your idea.
You,

1236
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:05,550
you run the show as an executive
producer,

1237
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,590
let me produce it.
I'll make it all happen.

1238
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,080
And I'm like fuck.
And he makes it really easy for me.

1239
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,980
He does all like when you walked in and
saw the stage,

1240
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:17,310
I didn't have anything to do with that
patient in production.

1241
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:20,580
I mean working on television.
He knows a lot of shit and he's such a

1242
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:21,440
good dude,
man.

1243
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:24,070
Victor's awesome.
He's one of my greatest friends ever.

1244
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,210
Man.
The best.

1245
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,690
Yeah.
So he's.

1246
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,430
We've known him forever to men,
whether we meet victor working at the

1247
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:33,480
UFC,
but when.

1248
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:35,420
What year was it?
Whew.

1249
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,910
That must've been 2008 ish.
Two thousand nine ish.

1250
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,230
Something like that.
I think it was even earlier than that

1251
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,450
thought he was lying thing.

1252
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,640
It was like six,
2000,

1253
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,080
six or seven.
I want to say he thought he was four

1254
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:51,570
years old.
Little Kid.

1255
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,250
Brock Lesnar Hanna was back in the Brock
Lesnar Das.

1256
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,370
That's,
that's what I remember for sure.

1257
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,760
Yeah,
there was definitely some kids.

1258
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,840
Awesome man.
And he's training a lot now too,

1259
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,150
right?
Yes.

1260
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:03,661
Yes.
He,

1261
00:55:03,661 --> 00:55:06,060
he broke his arm.
So He's been out a little while and

1262
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:07,890
stuff,
but he helps.

1263
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:11,220
He's a an Ebi.
I'm associate producer.

1264
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,930
Did he broke his arm training?
Yep.

1265
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,980
Yep.
Just don't crash.

1266
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,850
Oh,
I'm drawn.

1267
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,190
Crushed,
crushed with scary.

1268
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,600
That's a scary one.
So that's one of our favorite bone

1269
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,220
favorite.
It's.

1270
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,260
You rarely see it in mma,
you know,

1271
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:27,300
rarely.
So unusual.

1272
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:29,460
You know.
When was the last time you saw a bicep

1273
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:32,760
crushed?
I think George Sada Roblis did it.

1274
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:36,000
Did I think so?
Back back in the day when we used to

1275
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:38,590
work together.
I think he did it on a George Group.

1276
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,040
I don't know.
I get the names all mixed up,

1277
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:46,200
but a
crazy sport man.

1278
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:50,520
There's nothing crazier than MMA.
When you watch the combination of

1279
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:52,850
punching,
kicking and you're seeing,

1280
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,800
you're seeing a lot more guys go for the
leg locks.

1281
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,190
Now notice that you have seen there was
a guy,

1282
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,860
he didn't pull anything off though,
but forget he was,

1283
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:04,520
but he was all over dude's legs and
then.

1284
00:56:04,521 --> 00:56:07,260
But then he was,
couldn't get hit and a lot of angles,

1285
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:09,210
you know,
back you talking about,

1286
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:10,430
uh,
um.

1287
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,700
Was it a Darren Elkins fight?
Maybe?

1288
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,870
Maybe it was.
Um,

1289
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,030
fuck.
Who was he fighting?

1290
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,710
Maybe?
God dammit.

1291
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,690
It was a great fight for Elkins.
Why don't,

1292
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:23,950
why can't I remember who the hell he was
fighting too many people.

1293
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,850
And that last card this weekend.
Yeah,

1294
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,590
that's right.
Chad skelly.

1295
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:33,970
I think Chaz was like foreign one.
The UFC and Elkins is dominated them.

1296
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,760
Elkins move to um,
to um,

1297
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:40,210
Sacramento train with Alpha male moved
his family.

1298
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,010
Said fuck it.
I gotta make a run at that fight that

1299
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:42,940
I'm talking about.
Yeah.

1300
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,050
Thanks.
So yeah,

1301
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,360
he and Elkins just grounded,
pounded him.

1302
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,670
There was a couple times where he's
going for elkins legs,

1303
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:51,340
but elkins just grounded cognition.
I think you're gonna see a lot more leg

1304
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,910
locks down the hall and there is no
matter what,

1305
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,410
you got to watch your legs.
You could punch a guy in,

1306
00:56:57,411 --> 00:56:58,870
in this,
in his face or not.

1307
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,040
You got to watch your legs.
Ryan Hall take you.

1308
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,690
Get laid off real quick.
And then everybody's aware too,

1309
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:07,600
of the trend in Jujitsu and Gary Tony
was talking about,

1310
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,710
I mean he's going to do mma.

1311
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:13,260
It's strange seeing Ryan Hall in there,
you know,

1312
00:57:13,261 --> 00:57:15,130
it's strange because he's always been
the Jujitsu guy,

1313
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:15,964
you know,
and,

1314
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:18,490
and then we're going to see them.
Then we would do the man he's in there

1315
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:21,490
now and he's throwing down and he's,
he's making some waves.

1316
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,290
Yeah.
Gary Tonin is going to be really

1317
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,790
interesting because he's,
he's been striking for quite a while,

1318
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:29,110
like really trying to tighten it up.
Really working on getting that in order.

1319
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:31,840
And he's a smart guy.
He's not going to jump into anything

1320
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,630
like Kinda halfassed.
He'll have his striking in order for you

1321
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:36,320
as his first fight.
You'll get some blocks.

1322
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,540
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1323
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:41,920
And we'll get a lot of chokes.
We'll get all everything he says he's a

1324
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:44,680
bad motherfucker when it comes to
Jujitsu and only getting better.

1325
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,260
Yep.
I think the MMA fighters are always

1326
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:48,040
aware of trends.

1327
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,650
You know,
in the big trend in Jujitsu,

1328
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:52,270
it's not like they're not going to pay
attention to that.

1329
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,090
There's,
there's obviously a leg lock bias going

1330
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:57,550
on right now in Jujitsu where people
training that really heavily.

1331
00:57:57,551 --> 00:58:01,300
They realized,
I think there's a bunch of people kind

1332
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,880
of knew leg locks and we're good at like
locks,

1333
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:09,150
but it seems like once Donna,
her and that crew got involved in it,

1334
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:14,890
it became like a whole new level of
intensity when it comes to Lego blocks.

1335
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,670
Danaher's crew,
Gary Tonin,

1336
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,500
Eddie come into now,
Gordon Ryan.

1337
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:23,480
He just got his black belt from tonin
and that all started.

1338
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,570
That all started from Dean lister.
Yup.

1339
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,290
Yup.
Dean lister went down a hens those for a

1340
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,430
couple of weeks,
hung out with Danaher,

1341
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,380
showed them on a lot of leg luck.
Shit.

1342
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:36,240
I'm sure it probably lagged,
locked a lot of the upper level guys and

1343
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,140
made an impression.

1344
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,330
And uh,
and then Danaher being like,

1345
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,700
you know,
he's like a astrophysicist.

1346
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:45,370
He got,
he probably took that shit.

1347
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:48,940
The Dean lister told him and just,
uh,

1348
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,030
just blew it up.
He's such a wizard and just added so

1349
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,100
much stuff.
And then Eddie coming to super smart

1350
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,470
too.
So he's taken all the Shit Danner showed

1351
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:59,730
him and he's adding a lot of shit.
That's it all onto gary telling her and

1352
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,020
Gary told him he already had rear naked
choke.

1353
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:05,740
She already had great defense because
you just did a solid as fuck.

1354
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:10,630
He added leg locks over the last few
years and now fuck is the fucking.

1355
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,370
You want to hear something even crazier
than that.

1356
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,740
I go to donner,
go,

1357
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,730
how did Eddie coming to hurt his leg?
He goes,

1358
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:17,830
well,
he's was rolling with some of the other

1359
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:20,830
students that we have in the gym that
might be a little bit more advanced in

1360
00:59:20,831 --> 00:59:21,620
him with leg locks.

1361
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,720
They just don't use them yet.
Just don't.

1362
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,000
They don't compete.
I was like,

1363
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:27,740
what?
You got guys in your gym that don't

1364
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:29,420
compete,
that are better than any companies that

1365
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:31,800
lead locks and that was scary.
He says,

1366
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,680
oh,
how scary that is.

1367
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:34,851
But the way he.
John,

1368
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:37,700
Donna Harris says it very definitive.
Yeah.

1369
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,130
Perhaps we have guys that are maybe a
little bit more advanced than him.

1370
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,290
They don't compete.
There's two kinds of games now,

1371
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:50,030
ma'am.
There's that because you can shut down a

1372
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:54,530
leg lock game,
but you gotta have a solid clenching top

1373
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:58,970
heavy game.
You've got to have that slow smashing,

1374
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:03,080
destroying game to stop those lead.
Who's the best at stopping leg locks

1375
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:05,100
right now with our game?
Well,

1376
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,540
when I'd have to say,
um,

1377
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,780
I don't know who the best is,
but I would say,

1378
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,370
uh,
in Abu Dhabi,

1379
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:12,780
Lucas,
the pre Lucas Le Prix,

1380
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,610
he went against Gary Tone and,
and um,

1381
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,670
he,
he just hit him with the straight meet,

1382
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:24,010
caused me cut paths with that under hook
and just didn't finish them,

1383
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:27,860
but he stayed out of leg locked danger
and anyone on points one was,

1384
01:00:27,861 --> 01:00:29,300
this was last year was last year.

1385
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:30,980
That's impressive.
So I mean,

1386
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:35,870
technically he be Gary Tone and
technically he avoided all the shit.

1387
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:38,660
Smash them down.
I think he passes guard may have even

1388
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:40,070
took his back even to tell you the
truth.

1389
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:42,890
I don't remember.
I shouldn't say that.

1390
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,143
But,
um,

1391
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,820
nonetheless though he,
uh,

1392
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:48,920
uh,
that is,

1393
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,560
that's one kind of game right there
because he for sure it wasn't going to

1394
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:53,270
start playing leg locks with character
one.

1395
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,283
Fuck.
No,

1396
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,470
he knew the game was like,
we got to stay away from that shit.

1397
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:00,800
And you gotta be,
you gotTa know how to stay away and

1398
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:04,040
you've got to be able to put some heat
on someone's leg locks.

1399
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:05,630
You gotta know how to get out of Lego
blocks.

1400
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,090
If you're not working leg locks all the
goddamn time,

1401
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:11,930
you're going to be so far behind.
You really,

1402
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:15,020
really are.
It's a whole new world growing out

1403
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:15,440
there.

1404
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,440
And in the sub only world submission
only community if it's,

1405
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,870
if you don't know leg locks,
she will never survive in an

1406
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:26,630
interesting.
We'll never survive.

1407
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:30,110
So it go back just to when you were
competing in the tournament as a white

1408
01:01:30,111 --> 01:01:33,140
belt and people screaming and bullying
when you're going for a leg lock,

1409
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:36,410
could you imagine what it's like today?
Two thousand 16.

1410
01:01:36,411 --> 01:01:37,800
Nobody saw this coming.
Yeah.

1411
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,380
But there's still tons of resistance.
Unlike lock still.

1412
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,610
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1413
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:46,790
There still are.
Still a Jujitsu instructors out there

1414
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:50,840
posting the anti leg lock stuff.
You know what the problem is?

1415
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,720
It's the legs are the strongest muscles
in the body,

1416
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,570
right?
The legs are attached to the longest

1417
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:59,390
limbs you can.
You can move them in ways that you can

1418
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:02,090
never move your arms.
You realize how limited your arms are

1419
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:07,340
when you're not using your legs to go
after legs and to hold positions.

1420
01:02:07,341 --> 01:02:10,940
You realize like how it's kind of silly
almost to use your arms as opposed to

1421
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,720
most of the community looks at it like
in a negative way.

1422
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:16,070
It's a positive thing.
We'll have.

1423
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,100
You have a whole nother game to learn.
They don't.

1424
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,040
It's a whole nother game.

1425
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,780
That's the problem.
They don't want to learn the whole new

1426
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:22,730
game.
They,

1427
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,840
you know,
people get really good at one thing.

1428
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,060
They get really good at one thing and
then they want to stick with that shift.

1429
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:28,830
Yeah.
That's really what you got to get

1430
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:30,040
through that.
Isn't that amazing though,

1431
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:33,930
that the very thing that made you Jitsu
so popular in the first place was that

1432
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:38,250
it had figured out a way to make
something the most technically

1433
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:39,720
effective.
We're a small guy,

1434
01:02:39,721 --> 01:02:44,130
like hoists can be a big guy like Dan
severn like and it was the using the

1435
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:46,980
techniques that work,
but then these new techniques at work,

1436
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:47,814
they're like,
no,

1437
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,740
I don't know those.
You got to stick to the old.

1438
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,790
The old ones like,
no,

1439
01:02:52,791 --> 01:02:54,750
that's bullshit.
We just got to figure out how to defend

1440
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:57,030
against these blocks.
Let's get them out of the boys.

1441
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,240
Let's work this through kickbox and
shit.

1442
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,510
That's never going to catch on.
I mean there a lot of trends.

1443
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,060
Like there was a point in time where
people weren't throwing any head kicks.

1444
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,870
Deemed Lester's going to do this next
Ebi,

1445
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,730
Ebi,
Vinnie.

1446
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,210
My glass is one of those,
one of those rare Brazilians who's

1447
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,700
really into Samo too.
He has been preaching like locks and

1448
01:03:17,701 --> 01:03:22,260
he's very good at leg lateri amongst
many other things,

1449
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:23,930
so it is good at everything.
One,

1450
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,300
we got a Uri Samoas.
He's awesome.

1451
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,600
He's dobby,
right?

1452
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,560
He's.
He was,

1453
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:33,420
I don't know,
I don't remember.

1454
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:37,800
I mean that's a shitty answer for
someone who's putting them on the show.

1455
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,720
All I know.
All I know is he's really good and he

1456
01:03:40,721 --> 01:03:42,900
fought in Abu Dhabi.
Right?

1457
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:44,700
To find that out.
Jamie,

1458
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:50,040
yours.
Why you are someones why you are I s I m

1459
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,580
o e s Uri Somos.

1460
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,610
Yeah.
There's not much high level talent.

1461
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:58,980
Now.
Mark Martinez Dnas.

1462
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:01,620
He's from Marcello Garcia.
He's in it.

1463
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:05,430
A Bruno bosstones isn't it?
These are like high level dudes,

1464
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:05,921
man.
Yeah.

1465
01:04:05,921 --> 01:04:07,650
So if you listen,
if you're thinking about like,

1466
01:04:07,651 --> 01:04:09,390
man,
I never watched the tournament before

1467
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:11,460
with the way these guys are talking
about something about Dick hard.

1468
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,370
This is what you do.
You go on UFC fight pass.

1469
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:17,070
If you don't have UFC pipe pass.
If you like fights,

1470
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:17,910
man,
this is the.

1471
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:19,520
What is this him?
Yeah.

1472
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,440
Does it happen?
The best guys in the world?

1473
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,130
We're stacking on us.
We're stacked now,

1474
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:27,990
man.
He won the Abu Dhabi,

1475
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:28,824
right?
Does it say?

1476
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,400
Yeah?
Did he win?

1477
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,550
I'll be debi champion.
First thing.

1478
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,310
Oh Shit.
Two Thousand 15.

1479
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,500
I'm an idiot.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1480
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:40,980
Anyway,
multiple time world champion as a purple

1481
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:43,920
belt and it absolute,
he's just a bad mother fucker all

1482
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,000
around,
but what I'm saying is if you,

1483
01:04:46,001 --> 01:04:48,340
if you've never watched a submission
tournament,

1484
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,550
I've never seen guys try to submit each
other like this sounds kind of

1485
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:51,384
interesting.

1486
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,460
Get UFC fight pass.
I'm telling you,

1487
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:55,500
I don't want it to be.
I don't want to sound like a shill.

1488
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,850
I wish UFC would offer up a free month
of UFC fight pass so people would get

1489
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:02,610
addicted to it.
But if you're at home and you're bored

1490
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,680
and you're like,
ah,

1491
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:06,810
I don't know what to watch what's on tv,
you just feel like vegging out in front

1492
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:10,130
of the television.
UFC fight pass will occupy your fucking

1493
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,660
time.
You can find the greatest fights of all

1494
01:05:12,661 --> 01:05:13,740
time.
All of them.

1495
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,990
And we're doing five shows a year with
them.

1496
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,460
They want five least,

1497
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,160
so we got to pump them out every two
months or so.

1498
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,870
And on top of that,
you know,

1499
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:26,620
you got the people that are UFC fans
that are going to leak into it,

1500
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,640
you know,
that's a big one.

1501
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,160
And they have a ton of different
organizations as well,

1502
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,580
even of glory now.
Yup.

1503
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:32,960
Yup.
Cool.

1504
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:36,610
I'm Gary Tone in an eddy.
Come into both in this.

1505
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:39,010
Absolutely.
A Dj Jackson.

1506
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:41,960
I'm Richard Martinez.
Amir alum,

1507
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:46,480
a rust them chizzy of.
He's in Abu Dhabi.

1508
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:47,860
He,
I think he was second or third.

1509
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,750
This guys is.
Fuck.

1510
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,740
That's a huge wrestler.
Rustam Chessy of he's got hair on his

1511
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:56,400
back.
He just fucking spell his name to Jamie

1512
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:02,610
at r u s t a m I c h a s e e s c h a s e
I e v.

1513
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,690
It was this guy and I'm all.
Yeah,

1514
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,350
he's like,
what everyone is afraid of.

1515
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:19,380
When you think about Rustin wrestlers
that everybody's afraid of a guy,

1516
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,120
looks like he looks like a real live
wolverine.

1517
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,180
Hugh see the hair on his back.
He's got it on his back.

1518
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,040
How big is he?
He's dude.

1519
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:28,390
He is one of the.
Everyone's afraid of this dude.

1520
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:32,560
Very hard to do anything to this guy.
He keeps getting better and better.

1521
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:34,910
He wasn't.
I think he was second or third in Abu

1522
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:36,880
Dhabi.
He's got hair on his back like a

1523
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:39,640
werewolf.
Look at his fucking back.

1524
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,570
Nobody wants him to.
No one wants to be.

1525
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,390
No one wants to be paired up with that
guy.

1526
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:47,120
I couldn't imagine.
He's really good too.

1527
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:52,060
So passing is getting spectacular.
I wonder how long I like that can

1528
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,820
compete with that style.
We have like a good.

1529
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,230
No,
I was just going say it like that kind

1530
01:06:56,231 --> 01:06:58,900
of smashing.
Crushing power style.

1531
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,610
Boy,
that's so taxing.

1532
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,850
He used to.
He didn't used to pass as much.

1533
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:06,410
You should just throw people around and
get on top of malaria,

1534
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,130
but now he's really good at passing and
finishing.

1535
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:13,750
Now we got to Lucas roadshow.
Who's from Gracie Baha.

1536
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:15,080
One of the top guys.
This,

1537
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,290
this.
This is the most stacked we've ever been

1538
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,790
mad.
This is super,

1539
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,900
super stacked.
So awesome.

1540
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,990
Way To kick it off.
Yeah.

1541
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,850
It's going to be a way to kick it off on
fight pass.

1542
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,880
It's going to be fucking fun.
It's so fun.

1543
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:31,600
Isn't it amazing that it just became
something?

1544
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:32,760
You know,
it just.

1545
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:34,690
I never planned on it,
man.

1546
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,670
Hasn't though.
That's how it works.

1547
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:37,840
That shit.
That's this thing,

1548
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:41,170
this podcast.
Never again more shit.

1549
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:45,280
Like 10th planet wasn't even playing.
I know I'm 32 years old.

1550
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:46,540
I don't know nothing about no 10 planet.

1551
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,220
How crazy.
The 32,

1552
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:52,200
how crazy is it that we were like in
love with that Zechariah's hitching guys

1553
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:55,930
books now they think they might have
actually found this planet.

1554
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,070
Is that for real?
Oh yeah.

1555
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:59,980
I don't even pay attention to that and
they have no photographs of it,

1556
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:02,890
but they were pretty sure to the point
where they're stepping out and saying

1557
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:07,120
there's a large planet probably about
four times the size of earth that's

1558
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,600
outside of our theories.
No,

1559
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:10,930
not anymore.
It's real.

1560
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,720
Now it's mainstream.
Scientists are saying this.

1561
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:17,600
I think Tyson is addressed it.
People keep sending me shit,

1562
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:18,740
but I'm like,
oh,

1563
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:20,390
it's another one of those things.
They're going to.

1564
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,400
Jamie will pull it up for real.
Yeah.

1565
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:22,970
Well,
Eddie,

1566
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,280
Eddie turned me onto this.
He's like,

1567
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:27,230
dude,
you ever heard her is extra Zacharias

1568
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:32,090
hitchin and we got so deep ways to do
bong hits her and and talk about the

1569
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:34,640
Annunaki,
watched documentaries on it.

1570
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,300
Some crazy stripper told me about it.
She was like,

1571
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,030
do you know that we used in mind world
for gold?

1572
01:08:40,031 --> 01:08:41,030
And I'm like,
Gina,

1573
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:44,480
what are you talking about?
Because why do you think we like gold so

1574
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:46,700
much?
We used to be slaves and like,

1575
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,740
oh my God,
I just thought she was the craziest

1576
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:50,930
person ever.
And then I thought about it for five

1577
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,700
minutes.
I used to make music with her and I'm

1578
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:53,391
like,
wait a minute.

1579
01:08:53,391 --> 01:08:58,391
It is kind of weird that the one fucking
thing we all agree on is a gold is money

1580
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,740
has to one thing.
We all agree on nothing else.

1581
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,700
Then I asked Regina,
who is this guy who told,

1582
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,180
told,
told you about this,

1583
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,730
what is this guy's name?
And so she gave me his name.

1584
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:11,990
I called him up.
I said,

1585
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:13,040
hey,
I'm gina's friend.

1586
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,650
She said you were talking about some
crazy motherfucker who,

1587
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,060
who wrote books about a us being slaves
and all that shit because Oh yeah,

1588
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:24,520
some guy named will to a situation or
Zacharias itching.

1589
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,071
And I'm like,
okay.

1590
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:27,200
And I wrote it down that I looked into
them and that's how.

1591
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:32,450
This is all pre internet.
It was a sheet that 99 slash 2000,

1592
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:36,860
2000 you had the internet,
but it was harder to find shit back

1593
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:40,670
then.
The ninth planet does it exist a 10,000

1594
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:44,000
year orbit in outer reaches of our solar
system.

1595
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,550
So they're trying to figure it out right
now.

1596
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,850
But um,
what they believe is,

1597
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,960
and this is,
they've been believing this for awhile

1598
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,160
as it apparently there's,
where the reason why they declassified

1599
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:57,170
pluto,
they said it is on a planet anymore.

1600
01:09:57,171 --> 01:10:00,800
It's because Pluto is a large body in
the Kuyper belt.

1601
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:05,830
The kuiper belt is a belt of just large
asteroids and round things and shit

1602
01:10:07,401 --> 01:10:09,740
floating around out there,
which is really weird because the photos

1603
01:10:09,741 --> 01:10:14,030
of Pluto that they've released recently,
the really up close photos they just

1604
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:14,840
released.

1605
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,540
It's a fucking planet.
We're nitpicking here,

1606
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,730
that's a goddamn planet,
but they don't think it's big enough to

1607
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:20,564
be a planet.
Alright.

1608
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,750
Whatever it looks like a fucking planet.
Pull up the photos of Pluto.

1609
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:25,370
The newest food.
The amazing.

1610
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:26,420
Yeah,
exactly.

1611
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,590
Have you seen him?
No,

1612
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:29,480
I haven't seen him,
but to me it's like it's there,

1613
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:30,291
right?
It's there.

1614
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:32,480
You call it a planet.
You call her dwarf you call,

1615
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,920
they call,
you think they're going to call it a

1616
01:10:33,921 --> 01:10:34,670
dwarf,
you know,

1617
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:37,070
10,000 years ago.
Who cares what you call it?

1618
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,020
It's something,
it isn't like,

1619
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:40,040
oh no,
it never existed.

1620
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,380
It was a black hole.
No,

1621
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,450
it's a body of mass data.
What they think is that there's so many

1622
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:46,160
of these out there.
They found another one.

1623
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:48,860
Do you remember this?
You and I were at a bar having a drink

1624
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:50,350
one day.
Oh,

1625
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,950
here it goes.
These are the photos.

1626
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:52,500
Yeah,
fine.

1627
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,690
There's,
this is some of the photos.

1628
01:10:53,691 --> 01:10:56,900
I think those are color corrected to
show like different things,

1629
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,150
but there's some of the,
uh,

1630
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:01,730
the actual surface.
I think the far right one that you,

1631
01:11:01,731 --> 01:11:03,390
uh,
um.

1632
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:04,641
No,
no,

1633
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:04,851
no,
no.

1634
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:06,040
This is the moon,
Jamie.

1635
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:09,170
There was some,
some from the far right.

1636
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:11,570
One that's Pluto,
but that looks like the,

1637
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,010
the ones from that.
All images right

1638
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,880
there.
That's Pluto.

1639
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:18,210
The one down below.
Above Planet X.

1640
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,890
That's moon though.
Yeah.

1641
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:21,780
But look,
there's all these different planets on

1642
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:23,220
this earth.
Moon

1643
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,200
squared.

1644
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,120
Yeah.
That's Google search though,

1645
01:11:29,121 --> 01:11:32,270
right?
I'm just go to go to the web,

1646
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:36,980
search the web search and then just
write recent photos of Pluto.

1647
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,490
What is it?
New Cassini?

1648
01:11:39,491 --> 01:11:41,050
Is that what it is?
It took the photographs.

1649
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:43,080
What was the um,
the Cassini.

1650
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,340
So there's a bunch of Pluto says what
they're saying,

1651
01:11:45,341 --> 01:11:45,791
right?
Yeah.

1652
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,770
There's a bunch of.
So they found another one.

1653
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:51,040
You and I were at a bar once.
I remember this because I saw it on my

1654
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:52,690
phone,
so it had to be an iphone.

1655
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,610
Um,
someone had sent this to me.

1656
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:55,690
Dude,
you gotta check this out.

1657
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:58,540
I clicked on the link and went to a
website that showed that there was a new

1658
01:11:58,541 --> 01:11:59,620
planet and I was like,
dude,

1659
01:11:59,621 --> 01:12:02,560
they found it,
but it turned out it was right before

1660
01:12:02,561 --> 01:12:04,690
they declassified pullo.
They went,

1661
01:12:04,691 --> 01:12:06,610
wait a minute,
there's a bunch of these fucking things

1662
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:07,960
out there.
These aren't really planets,

1663
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:10,750
and so they think,
to make a long story short,

1664
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,080
there's a bunch of these things out
there and then behind that is a thing

1665
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:18,070
called the galactic shelf where it just
drops off and that would indicate that

1666
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:19,950
there's a large,
high,

1667
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,720
large,
massive object out there,

1668
01:12:22,721 --> 01:12:23,554
another planet.

1669
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:25,400
What if they like?
There's nothing there,

1670
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:29,050
there's nothing that's this blackness
would have like,

1671
01:12:29,051 --> 01:12:31,060
who knows,
like really what's out there,

1672
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,580
you know,
like scientists.

1673
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,000
What do you mean?
The astronomers,

1674
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,310
they have some pretty insane fucking
telescopes now.

1675
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:37,990
They can see some wild,
wild shit.

1676
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:40,030
They've identified hundreds of planets
now,

1677
01:12:40,031 --> 01:12:43,390
which is really weird because just a
decade or so ago they hadn't identified

1678
01:12:43,391 --> 01:12:46,590
any outside of our solar system.
It's only a hundred seats.

1679
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:48,640
I think it's probably hundreds.
Yeah,

1680
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:50,250
look at that.
Woo.

1681
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,970
Look at the surface of that thing,
man.

1682
01:12:51,971 --> 01:12:54,670
That's crazy.
You can take a picture of Pluto.

1683
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,630
Yeah,
but look at it.

1684
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,440
That is a circular round thing that
looks like a planet.

1685
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:03,250
So,
but whatever nitpicky that that's not a

1686
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:05,860
planet.
It's because there's a gang of those out

1687
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:06,580
there,
dude,

1688
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,830
there's a gang of them.
They don't know how many there are.

1689
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:09,940
They're going to find new ones.

1690
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:14,180
This kaiper belt,
there's a bunch of little tiny objects

1691
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:19,010
out there that are like Pluto size
smaller than Pluto and I think they

1692
01:13:19,011 --> 01:13:22,520
assume that they're going to find more
because this object,

1693
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,920
whatever it is,
it's outside outside.

1694
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:28,940
Like in the 10,000 year orbit around
Earth is big way bigger than us.

1695
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:32,210
Four times outside of that,
those little side,

1696
01:13:32,211 --> 01:13:35,580
all the little ones that's.
There's apparently there's a dropoff,

1697
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:38,200
there's like the belt.
I might be butchering this and if I am,

1698
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:41,060
I apologize,
but what I've read and try to remember

1699
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,780
was that there is something called the
galactic shelf and that would indicate

1700
01:13:44,781 --> 01:13:49,550
something that has a lot of mass,
something that has a lot of gravity,

1701
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:53,110
something that's big,
and so they think it's bigger than.

1702
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,220
I mean they're,
they're saying it's four times the size

1703
01:13:55,221 --> 01:13:56,600
of earth,
so something really big.

1704
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,370
Just fucking nuts,
man.

1705
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:01,550
It's just nuts to think there's another
planet out there

1706
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:08,540
and what's even more not says what if
there's fucking life forms on it.

1707
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:13,840
What if this thing in this 10,000 orbit
around Earth is heated by its core would

1708
01:14:15,231 --> 01:14:17,590
have it gets its heat instead of from
the sun would have.

1709
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:21,880
It gets its heat internally and it's
life forces are all from an internally.

1710
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:27,280
Maybe that's where the auto Nakia.
Imagine if that was a real story.

1711
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,390
Imagine this Annunaki thing and
everybody laughs at it.

1712
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:34,330
Everybody thinks it's funny,
but like when the 10,000 years rolls

1713
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:35,950
around,
that motherfucker gets close.

1714
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,530
They really are a bunch of aliens living
on that thing.

1715
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:39,364
Who made us.

1716
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:45,550
Could you fucking imagine?
Nothing would ever mean anything.

1717
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:47,220
Again,
your credit cards,

1718
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:51,010
how much gas is.
Nobody would give a fuck.

1719
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:55,000
It would all be so,
so back of your mind.

1720
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:57,190
Everything would be in the back of your
mind except,

1721
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:00,400
oh my God,
there's a planet out there is a bunch of

1722
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:02,380
fucking people who made us out of
monkeys.

1723
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,980
They came down,
they did genetic engineering experiments

1724
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:09,400
on monkeys just like we would do.
Just like we would do if we,

1725
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:12,610
we've,
we've found some planet in outer space,

1726
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:18,330
especially if we were like scientists
that were like thousands of years

1727
01:15:20,201 --> 01:15:22,210
removed from us today,
like way,

1728
01:15:22,211 --> 01:15:22,871
way,
way,

1729
01:15:22,871 --> 01:15:23,920
way,
way in the future.

1730
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:26,440
Maybe millions,
like a million years more evolved.

1731
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,680
They look at these monkeys like we'll
just get help them out here to help them

1732
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:30,790
out.
We know where this is going.

1733
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:32,020
Anyway.
Just grabbed them.

1734
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:37,050
Shoot some fucking woman where her.
That'd be the greatest thing to

1735
01:15:37,931 --> 01:15:42,820
experience ever.
Like what could you imagine how earth

1736
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:47,821
shattering it would be if there was a
real life form from another planet that

1737
01:15:47,981 --> 01:15:51,370
we could absolutely identify a real
civilization and they were super

1738
01:15:51,371 --> 01:15:53,140
advanced and they were coming by to
visit

1739
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:55,970
Jesus Christ.
Sorry,

1740
01:15:56,070 --> 01:16:01,070
I'd have some questions.
We have no idea what,

1741
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,800
what we're inside of like,
we're just.

1742
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,050
It's in.
You can't.

1743
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:15,051
Even if it's
aliens and space is man,

1744
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:18,250
remember how we were so into him like in
the,

1745
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:20,740
in the late 90 [inaudible] or the early
two thousands.

1746
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,060
Aliens were like fucking always on my
mind.

1747
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:27,750
Not Anymore though.
I think it's because the history channel

1748
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:30,180
killed that,
that ancient aliens.

1749
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:33,780
Maybe that was the plan all along is you
know what,

1750
01:16:33,781 --> 01:16:37,230
let's kill this whole fucking alien
movement by putting it on history

1751
01:16:37,231 --> 01:16:42,070
channel over and over again,
but what is called me up?

1752
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,190
Dude,
you called me up once.

1753
01:16:44,191 --> 01:16:46,020
He was a hilarious conversation.
You go to.

1754
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,560
I'm just not in a fucking aliens
anymore.

1755
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:57,710
History Channel clucking.
How cool was that?

1756
01:16:58,471 --> 01:17:01,350
First Season of ancient aliens?
Awesome.

1757
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:05,080
Fuck.
He was going to mainstream and

1758
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,750
mainstream.
It was awesome,

1759
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:08,780
man.
Then they did another season.

1760
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,010
Just ran out of shit to

1761
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,230
talk about.
Unfortunately they special.

1762
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:17,390
You just start off as a special maybe.
Maybe.

1763
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:20,630
Then it turned into a series of fuck.
Those first funds are awesome.

1764
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,940
He's awesome.
Oh Man.

1765
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:24,980
What was the last time we talked to him?
Have you talked to him in a while?

1766
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:28,140
Man.
I wonder about the overall industry is

1767
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:30,530
kinda down like he got upset when I was
honest.

1768
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:34,620
I think about some of the stuff.
I just think that,

1769
01:17:34,621 --> 01:17:37,340
but some of it is just to bullshitty.
It's just too.

1770
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,970
It's like could be.
It was aliens,

1771
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,270
like I'll come on,
man.

1772
01:17:41,271 --> 01:17:43,180
They went to.
They're selling.

1773
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,113
Yeah.

1774
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,790
There's a certain amount of that stuff
that is absolutely fascinating.

1775
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,520
When you look at some of the,
um,

1776
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:54,150
depictions of like aircraft.
So like the Egyptians used to do.

1777
01:17:54,151 --> 01:17:56,300
They used to make like these little
model aircraft,

1778
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,670
compelling evidence for you for if you
had like a Ufo was a skeptic right here

1779
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:04,400
and you got like five minutes.
What's your go to?

1780
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,510
Almost nothing.
Nothing right now.

1781
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:13,170
That's what's fucked up.
Nothing was nothing.

1782
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:17,510
There's that one thing you can put
disclosure project all the witnesses and

1783
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:18,260
stuff.
Yeah.

1784
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,093
That's interesting.

1785
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:23,540
The other mind you just never know.
You just never know.

1786
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:26,090
There's all sorts of experiences that
people can have.

1787
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,950
Two that are very,
very unusual weather condition.

1788
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,800
Things like ball,
lightning ball,

1789
01:18:33,801 --> 01:18:37,550
lightning is one that's really crazy
because apparently there's a swamp gas.

1790
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:40,220
Well,
this ball lightning apparently moves

1791
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:44,420
like some alien space craft and
apparently if you saw a ball lightning

1792
01:18:44,421 --> 01:18:47,390
and they've identified it,
it's like this really rare form of

1793
01:18:47,391 --> 01:18:51,020
lightning that instead of coming down
like really fast,

1794
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:52,250
like a,
a line,

1795
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,790
it can move around and it's the same
sort of idea.

1796
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,860
It's like an electrical charge that
breaks free,

1797
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:58,851
you know,
I don't,

1798
01:18:58,851 --> 01:19:00,770
I'm not doing a good job of explaining
it,

1799
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:05,030
but I've seen videos on and I've seen it
explained and I think if you were flying

1800
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:08,960
around man and you saw that,
you'd probably think that was a Ufo and

1801
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:11,930
if you saw a lot of the experimental
aircraft that they did,

1802
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:14,060
I talked about it with schermer before
you got here.

1803
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,830
I think there's a lot of that stuff

1804
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:17,870
was just people seeing this shit for
sure.

1805
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:20,360
Most of the,
probably the more,

1806
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:24,140
the more um,
the more you get into

1807
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:30,970
how I'm fucked up like corporations are
and how fucked up like we've been for so

1808
01:19:32,211 --> 01:19:34,610
long.
The more you look at aliens like Ah,

1809
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:39,190
they are just as distracting us.
They want us to pick them up fucking

1810
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,820
areas.
You know what I mean?

1811
01:19:40,821 --> 01:19:43,070
It seems like a big distraction.
Distraction.

1812
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,320
I think people love it.

1813
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:46,910
That's why it's on.
I think it sells.

1814
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,920
I don't even think they're trying to
distract us.

1815
01:19:48,921 --> 01:19:51,620
I think it appeals to that archetype and
it's one of the things that schermer

1816
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:54,620
talked about before you got here in the
earlier podcast.

1817
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,100
We were talking about how it's like for
a lot of people that are atheist,

1818
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:01,040
that becomes their God and it kind of
makes sense.

1819
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:01,521
It's like,
well,

1820
01:20:01,521 --> 01:20:06,521
I don't believe in fairy tales,
but I believe maybe we are created by

1821
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:08,220
aliens who ran experiments

1822
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,610
on monkeys and they're all written like,
how can we won't believe the Bible?

1823
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:15,100
But we believed the Sumerian texts.
Well,

1824
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,930
that's funny.
That is too easy question is that we.

1825
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:20,460
We don't.
We're not into the Bible,

1826
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:22,770
but we're into some with that.
Those people were dummies,

1827
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:26,130
but these people 2000 years before them
do,

1828
01:20:26,131 --> 01:20:29,310
they had it nailed what it is.
It's not God's.

1829
01:20:29,311 --> 01:20:30,360
It's aliens,
man.

1830
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:34,200
They came from another planet.
Depends on the story because an alien

1831
01:20:34,201 --> 01:20:36,040
story actually kind of makes sense
because we're.

1832
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,850
We're just,
we're in space and shit.

1833
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,950
There's a lot of.
It's.

1834
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,510
I always think of it as would we do it?
Would we do it,

1835
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:49,190
do what would we run experiments on some
life form that we saw on some other

1836
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,980
form.
Of course,

1837
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,240
what do we do to.
Monkeys were doing emotional testing

1838
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:54,780
aids medicine on monkeys and shit.

1839
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,230
We would do some weird shit with some
monkeys from another planet to heal.

1840
01:20:58,231 --> 01:21:00,240
Probably doing some weird ass shit on
this planet.

1841
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:01,390
We don't know about.
Oh,

1842
01:21:01,391 --> 01:21:02,970
for sure.
There's kind of a clone.

1843
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:05,670
Humans everywhere.
Especially not in America where you

1844
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:08,240
don't have any rules,
you know you can go to some countries

1845
01:21:08,241 --> 01:21:11,550
don't do anything like China's started
doing experiments on human embryos,

1846
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,540
genetic experiments on human embryos.
Raise it men.

1847
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:17,400
You know what I mean?
Just genetically modified Superman.

1848
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,220
Yeah.
I mean it's just a matter of time before

1849
01:21:20,221 --> 01:21:22,830
they do something like that.
If they can do this genetic engineering

1850
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:25,980
and get through a few generations of it
to the fact they get the kinks ironed

1851
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:30,981
out and start making a series of super
along with the Einstein brain.

1852
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,980
Yeah.
Can you imagine if they can have a brain

1853
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:37,710
beyond Einstein?
If you could create a human or a clone,

1854
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:41,880
but you could do something so the brain
develops like 10 times stronger and

1855
01:21:41,881 --> 01:21:43,330
you're just like,
yeah,

1856
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:45,210
I'm going to read minds and probably
going to happen.

1857
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,170
It's definitely gonna happen.
And then when that does happen and we

1858
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:52,020
see some poor monkey on some other
planet and we've fucking flying around

1859
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:53,380
out there in space and be like,
that's fixed.

1860
01:21:53,381 --> 01:21:57,510
That dude skim a little charges.
Just squirt in there and see if he could

1861
01:21:57,511 --> 01:22:00,660
figure it out from here.
Take that monkey reengineer it,

1862
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,840
give it a language.
It probably would've figured out

1863
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:06,300
language given enough time.
Do you know they think that chips are

1864
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:09,900
starting to enter into the stone age.
It looks like I was just watching a

1865
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:11,790
documentary of a monkey and everyone's
seen those,

1866
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:12,421
those,
those,

1867
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:15,480
uh,
videos of monkeys with sticks and they

1868
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:17,700
using it to eat ants and shit like that.
I was watching.

1869
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:23,670
I was watching a video of a monkey who
broke off a stick and started banging

1870
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:26,970
the bark to get some money that was
under the bark,

1871
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,240
but the stick wasn't big enough,
so he throws it and he helps him,

1872
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:33,770
grabs another one,
carbs at all help and then start to.

1873
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:38,610
He should probably be using that as a
weapon at this point.

1874
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,140
If he's doing that,
you know what I mean?

1875
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:44,280
What happens then when when they learn
how to use it as a weapon on each other

1876
01:22:44,281 --> 01:22:45,031
and shit?
Well,

1877
01:22:45,031 --> 01:22:48,090
what's amazing is what if what we're
seeing is them learning it.

1878
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:51,570
What if what we're seeing is like when
they're just starting to observe this

1879
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:54,510
now,
what if in our lifetime they start using

1880
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:58,170
tools like it seems like that's what's
going on because they don't either.

1881
01:22:58,171 --> 01:22:59,850
It's one of two things.
Either they just didn't have enough

1882
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:03,000
video of them back then and they didn't
have enough people observing them,

1883
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:06,880
but to really realize they've probably
been these tools for 100 years or so,

1884
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:09,670
or they just started doing it in our
lifetime.

1885
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,620
You know?
That's.

1886
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,470
That could be possible if you ever seen
snopes.

1887
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,360
Snopes is because I don't know if this
is true.

1888
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:20,710
There's an orangutan that's fishing with
a spear.

1889
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:24,400
He's hanging off of a fucking branch
over this river.

1890
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:26,920
He needs got a spirit.
There's a photo of it.

1891
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:30,940
I just don't know if it's true.
It looks so good and it's always one of

1892
01:23:30,941 --> 01:23:34,480
those things.
It's one of those things I've always

1893
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:35,820
wanted to google it.
I'm just,

1894
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:38,050
I'll get to that tomorrow and I just
never get to it.

1895
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,030
I got other shit in my life to worry
about,

1896
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:44,980
but now these people out these days,
but I remember I just remembered I have

1897
01:23:44,981 --> 01:23:46,450
to get.
Do you see A.

1898
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,390
Jamie does.
I don't see it on snopes,

1899
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:52,030
but it says it's true.
Although the eight didn't sufficiently

1900
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:54,790
didn't develop the skill enough to catch
fish,

1901
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,650
whatever.
Show the picture.

1902
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,270
This is what's crazy.
Look at this.

1903
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,390
Come on son.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1904
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,580
This is true.
Okay.

1905
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:08,110
If this is true,
that's a goddamn weapon that orangutan

1906
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:10,870
is sticking a long stick into the water.

1907
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,490
Trying to.
It's true.

1908
01:24:12,491 --> 01:24:17,491
Although ape did not develop sufficient
skill to catch any fish yet he's trends.

1909
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,060
This is insane.
You would think he borneo would speed up

1910
01:24:22,061 --> 01:24:22,990
that evolution,
right?

1911
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:25,450
If he's actually,
man,

1912
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,670
they're probably learning from watching
fishermen and shit.

1913
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:30,910
Yeah.
I have to learn that watery refraction

1914
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:33,270
thing and that might not be capable of
doing now.

1915
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,900
Oh right.
Yeah,

1916
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:37,360
that's right.
Water refraction is.

1917
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:41,290
It's a big factor in both fishing.
These people with fish,

1918
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:43,480
with bows and arrows.
When you look at a wall,

1919
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,170
like if you look at a fish,
say if you look down in the water and

1920
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:49,090
you see like the fish will be where this
laptop is.

1921
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,270
It's not really there.
It's like six inches lower than that,

1922
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:55,810
but there's this weird refraction thing
going on because you're looking through

1923
01:24:55,811 --> 01:24:57,790
water,
so it's like looking through all the

1924
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:59,080
funhouse mirror kind of.

1925
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:03,220
So you have to learn how to shoot under
and the grant tank might not be able to

1926
01:25:03,221 --> 01:25:04,540
figure that out.
Very smart.

1927
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:06,070
Jamie,
did you figure that out on your own?

1928
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:10,270
He fucking wizard powerful Jamie.
Yeah,

1929
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:10,990
that's.
That's.

1930
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:12,610
That makes a lot of sense.
But how crazy is it?

1931
01:25:12,611 --> 01:25:16,310
Seen him try that.
A ranked him by himself with a pole.

1932
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:18,760
I mean these not as.
He's not like at the circus.

1933
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:21,760
Nobody taught them that.
Those things are smart as fuck,

1934
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:23,770
man.
Who's going to be a crazy fucking karate

1935
01:25:23,771 --> 01:25:26,090
dude who goes out to the jungle?
Starts Teaching Monkey.

1936
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:30,500
How do Kendo get them?
Give them swords and shaky.

1937
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,080
Imagine if they got,
oh my God.

1938
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:34,630
Supplied the gorillas with sword,
Samurai swords.

1939
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,940
Bump bump,
bump.

1940
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,500
I mean,
that's planet of the apes is not that

1941
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,100
far off it would it be the teacher?
I'm like,

1942
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,480
Jane Goodall got all evil and shit
started teaching on that fucking cut.

1943
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:48,640
Jane Goodall believes in bigfoot.
Does she?

1944
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:51,670
Yeah.
She might come back for bigfoot right

1945
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:54,180
there.
She's not.

1946
01:25:54,181 --> 01:25:55,110
Not.
Not only just,

1947
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:59,820
she believes she is certain.
She cert is talking about a,

1948
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,010
a pull up Jane Goodall.
Jane Goodall believes in big.

1949
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:07,550
It's insane when you listen to it.
Like she's way smarter than me and she

1950
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:12,050
knows way more about primates than I do.
So I talk shit.

1951
01:26:12,051 --> 01:26:13,700
I say I don't think big foot's real.
He might be,

1952
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:16,640
but I don't think it's real,
but when I hear someone as smart as her

1953
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:19,760
who basically lives in the jungle,
I mean she's in the jungle,

1954
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:22,610
so God damn much.
You might as well live in the jungle and

1955
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:23,930
this is what she says.
Listen to this,

1956
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,250
not be her talking and we'll see.

1957
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:29,960
No,
I'm pretty sure it is

1958
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,760
what you now I know you do wonderful
chimp calls.

1959
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,230
Well,
I'm going to do the greeting.

1960
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:39,470
That's the kind of sound you'd hear if
you went to Gombe and you climbed up

1961
01:26:39,471 --> 01:26:41,600
onto the ridge.
How long is this video and if you're

1962
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:44,240
lucky you chimpanzee who's calling out
saying,

1963
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,130
here I am.
It's a wonderful day.

1964
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,113
Where are you?

1965
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:48,890
Ooh,
Ooh,

1966
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:51,000
Ooh,
Ooh,

1967
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,440
Ooh,
Ooh.

1968
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,060
Each one has his own individual voice.
You know exactly who's calling.

1969
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:02,100
Where's bigfoot,
Bro?

1970
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:03,720
I'm going to probably have to speak with
you

1971
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,130
undiscovered.
You're talking about Yeti or big photos.

1972
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,640
Is that what he's talking about?
Yes,

1973
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:14,820
he is.
He is pretty much out of the loop.

1974
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:17,930
Well,
now you will be amazed when I tell you

1975
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:22,190
that I'm sure that they exist.
I've talked to so many native Americans

1976
01:27:22,191 --> 01:27:26,720
who've all described the same sound too,
who've seen them and there was little

1977
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:29,990
tiny snippet in the newspaper just last
week,

1978
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:33,560
which says the British scientists have
found what they believed to be a Yeti

1979
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:37,850
hair and that the scientists and the
natural history museum in London

1980
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,050
couldn't identify it as any known
animal.

1981
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:42,980
Did you always have this belief that I'm
a romantic,

1982
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:47,220
so I always wanted them to assist
animals.

1983
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:50,070
Will my passion from even before I could
speak.

1984
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,170
I think that's it.
Oh,

1985
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,240
a couple of,
a couple of people told her that they

1986
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:54,880
solid

1987
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,030
so
she didn't see it,

1988
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,640
but he's been in the jungle for 75
years,

1989
01:28:00,641 --> 01:28:02,660
but that was supposed to be in the
jungle where she goes,

1990
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:05,020
you're supposed to be in the woods.
Where is,

1991
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,040
um,
what did she say?

1992
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:07,850
The University of what?
Uh,

1993
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,420
see,
see if you could figure out what she

1994
01:28:10,421 --> 01:28:12,730
said.
Like what university is that is testing

1995
01:28:12,731 --> 01:28:15,670
a Yeti hair because I think that's
bullshit.

1996
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:18,810
I would have heard about that.
They don't,

1997
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:19,640
it's not A.
No.

1998
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,870
Like when I was on the Scifi show,
we tested some stuff.

1999
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,970
We tested hair.
We talked with this guy,

2000
01:28:24,971 --> 01:28:26,560
todd desoto from,
um,

2001
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:30,940
um,
I'm someone big university in New York

2002
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:32,500
City.
I forget which one and why you,

2003
01:28:32,501 --> 01:28:33,011
I guess?
Yeah,

2004
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:36,610
I guess he's an Nyu guy and I'm hope I'm
not wrong todd,

2005
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
but he's,
I'm a geneticist and so we ran tests on

2006
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:47,150
a feces and on hair and the hair was
bear hair and the bear shit too.

2007
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:52,750
And maybe some dog hairs to give a shit.
Shit got him.

2008
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,810
He didn't think it was at all.
No,

2009
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:55,931
no,
he's,

2010
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:58,990
he's dedicated to disproving it.
But there was other scientists that gave

2011
01:28:58,991 --> 01:28:59,630
us.
That's,

2012
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:01,830
that's the one I'm talking about.
Like what made him think

2013
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,330
it was big?
Bigfoot shit.

2014
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:05,910
Shit Bro.
Smell it.

2015
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:11,060
Smell it.
Maybe the bear had fucking bad fish or

2016
01:29:12,601 --> 01:29:16,470
something.
They couldn't even agree on what it

2017
01:29:16,471 --> 01:29:19,080
eats.
There were so sure as shit.

2018
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:21,300
They can't agree.
They can agree on what big foot eats

2019
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,440
good.
Who the fuck discovered that big foot

2020
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:25,560
shit?
We gotta find that.

2021
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:27,780
Did I met?
I met that dude,

2022
01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:28,910
the guy that found the shit.
Yeah.

2023
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:30,570
Yeah.
I had a conversation with him too.

2024
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:33,480
He's a nice guy.
He's a teacher in a school.

2025
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:38,510
Where did he find teacher in Oregon?
Funding out in the woods.

2026
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,420
It was like,
this got to be big foot shut.

2027
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:46,110
I'm going to take it with me.
I would think big food would lay logs

2028
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:48,990
like this big as my thigh.
Just giant.

2029
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:51,480
Ever see a elephant?
Take Shit.

2030
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,220
And you see his ass hole open up and
he'd go,

2031
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,980
good Lord.
I'm

2032
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:59,700
just flopping out of there.
This giant asshole.

2033
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:02,420
That's what I imagined from pig foot.
Do you believe that there?

2034
01:30:02,421 --> 01:30:02,850
Um,
you know,

2035
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:06,350
some people believe in bigfoot but they
also believe in a different kind of big

2036
01:30:06,351 --> 01:30:07,920
foot.
It's like a different kind of like a

2037
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:09,480
Christian church,
like a Lutheran.

2038
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:10,590
They believe.
Yes.

2039
01:30:10,591 --> 01:30:12,980
We believe in bigfoot,
but we believe it's an interdimensional

2040
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,040
being.
I've heard that one.

2041
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:16,430
What do you think the chances of that
pain rail?

2042
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,840
Probably 100 percent.

2043
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:26,970
Not just big foot.
I don't believe.

2044
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,100
I believe it's real.
Okay.

2045
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,210
I to stop right here,
Bro.

2046
01:30:30,211 --> 01:30:32,250
I'm one eighth native American,
um,

2047
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:35,850
my grandmother's side and uh,
those are our people.

2048
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:40,070
Our people have long known of the
existence of what we call the Alma.

2049
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,720
I have a bunch of different names for
it.

2050
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:44,520
You know,
what the new name,

2051
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,630
every time I go up to Oregon or
Washington or do a seminar,

2052
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:53,640
I asked the guys by show of hands who
believes in bigfoot and most of them do.

2053
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:56,040
Most of them do.
Yeah.

2054
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:59,190
Well,
most of them that I've heard stories,

2055
01:30:59,191 --> 01:31:00,990
you know,
I believed in it for the longest time

2056
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:04,110
and I don't disbelieve in it today.
I don't disbelieve in it,

2057
01:31:04,111 --> 01:31:06,250
but that's one you can make fun of.
But if it,

2058
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,830
if they found big foot,
I wouldn't be like,

2059
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,360
oh,
I'd be like,

2060
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:11,010
Oh shit,
that's real.

2061
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:13,350
I definitely don't disbelieve in it.
And you know what?

2062
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:14,550
And I'll,
I'll just say it.

2063
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:17,670
I think maybe he isn't or dimensional,
you know what I mean?

2064
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,440
That's how,
that's my gut feeling

2065
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:25,280
sticks.
You know,

2066
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:28,170
you can take your science,
but at the end of the day it's all about

2067
01:31:28,171 --> 01:31:29,004
faith,
Bro.

2068
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,160
It's all about knowing in your heart and
make sense.

2069
01:31:32,161 --> 01:31:35,040
That's why you can't find them.
Motherfuckers just disappears.

2070
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:36,810
I know in my heart,
no defendant with my life.

2071
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,570
That's the only fucking answer I know,
bro.

2072
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,760
It's interdimensional press what I'm
thinking.

2073
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:44,280
That's why they can't find them.
You can't put pig foot on camera,

2074
01:31:44,281 --> 01:31:45,390
bro.
He knows about cameras.

2075
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:47,490
I start going to happen,
man.

2076
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:50,250
It's not going to appear.
Where's the camera or disbelief?

2077
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,860
Just because he doesn't want a closed
isn't mean these primitive

2078
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:55,470
superintelligent.
They know you don't believe Bro.

2079
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,080
He's at one with nature.
He's not going to be near you have,

2080
01:31:58,081 --> 01:32:00,470
unless you're pure superintelligent.

2081
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:03,730
You can't find.
You've got to live with the sasquatch

2082
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,050
for them.
Take a foot,

2083
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:08,550
don't shake you in.
There's a bunch of dudes who have

2084
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:13,060
claimed to have had friendships with
sasquatches like to move into the woods

2085
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:14,440
and they stayed there for months at a
time.

2086
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:15,701
And then they,
uh,

2087
01:32:15,701 --> 01:32:17,740
they,
they tell people they had these stories

2088
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:21,730
and there's video,
there's audio recordings of what they

2089
01:32:21,731 --> 01:32:24,250
call Samurai talk.
You want to hear audio recordings that

2090
01:32:24,251 --> 01:32:26,620
people think is a sasquatch.
You want to laugh?

2091
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,150
Oh,
you're ready to laugh hard.

2092
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:29,890
I,
I could do sasquatch.

2093
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:33,910
She didn't say it was at a university.
It's the natural history museum in

2094
01:32:33,911 --> 01:32:34,744
London.

2095
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,180
No,

2096
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:45,850
Kim Christ that up.
You can't just make a noise.

2097
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:50,320
They have a us.
It's the dumbest recording ever.

2098
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,240
Samurai chatter.
Listen to this.

2099
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:55,030
Get ready for this shit.
You gonna you gonna blow a gasket.

2100
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:59,080
We had to analyze this on the show.
This is how when I knew my show is

2101
01:32:59,081 --> 01:32:59,914
retarded,

2102
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:04,830
Sierra's listen to this.
And he was there one time with a friend

2103
01:33:04,831 --> 01:33:09,831
and every evening they used to have some
absolutely bizarre noises and cool.

2104
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:11,970
So they couldn't figure out what the
hell it was.

2105
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,940
And um,
so they took a tape recorder one time.

2106
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,860
And this is what they recorded.

2107
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:23,210
Okay.
It is very bazaar.

2108
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:28,963
Indeed.

2109
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:52,230
We decided to record the sound.
I'm available to people.

2110
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:53,461
Oh,
what a good mood.

2111
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,500
Do you believe these creatures are
trying to communicate with us?

2112
01:33:55,501 --> 01:33:58,050
So.
And we as we speak or having the

2113
01:33:58,051 --> 01:34:02,910
linguistics people look into it,
they are very encouraged by what they're

2114
01:34:02,911 --> 01:34:04,110
saying so far.
Is it human

2115
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:06,160
shit?

2116
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,500
The range that supersedes what a human
can do.

2117
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:12,640
The range supersedes the human by a
previous study at the University of

2118
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:17,640
Wyoming to be spontaneous and no signs
of being rerecorded or prerecorded

2119
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:23,070
altered speeds.
So the idea of a hopes.

2120
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,850
It's very unprobable as far as
professionals are concerned at this

2121
01:34:25,851 --> 01:34:26,520
time.

2122
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:30,870
Well you reduce.
They made this video got uploaded,

2123
01:34:30,871 --> 01:34:33,990
2013.
Have you that?

2124
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,140
Is there anything look more like a man
in a monkey suit in that picture,

2125
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:50,240
but here's the thing.
Imagine if they really did sound like

2126
01:34:50,581 --> 01:34:51,720
that.
I mean,

2127
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:56,400
what does chimps sound stupid to work if
you heard that,

2128
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:58,280
but more complicated

2129
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:00,560
with an actual language like dolphin
noises,

2130
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:04,060
sound stupid of dolphins,
didn't make those noises and you heard

2131
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:04,933
the dolphin noises.

2132
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:09,280
He'd be like,
that's not a language.

2133
01:35:09,281 --> 01:35:10,960
What is that?
How weird.

2134
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:17,010
Imagine that Shit's real.
Imagine there's like 20 of them.

2135
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:19,750
I'll just live in deep,
deep,

2136
01:35:19,751 --> 01:35:22,510
deep in the woods.
What's more believable?

2137
01:35:22,511 --> 01:35:27,130
Big Foot or Loch Ness?
I think loch ness is probably a really

2138
01:35:27,131 --> 01:35:29,740
big fish,
like some kind of really big fish,

2139
01:35:29,741 --> 01:35:34,741
like a sturgeon or some shit.
Something something really big that

2140
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,520
there's not that many of them.
You see that video of that guy petting a

2141
01:35:39,521 --> 01:35:41,210
great white shark,
a great white sharks.

2142
01:35:41,211 --> 01:35:41,930
Just.
Yeah,

2143
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:43,330
it's on my instagram.
Oh really?

2144
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:44,250
Yeah,
yeah,

2145
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:45,790
yeah.
Maybe I saw it on instagram.

2146
01:35:45,810 --> 01:35:46,590
You might have.
Yeah.

2147
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:50,290
That's one of the weirdest fucking
videos.

2148
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:53,280
Adversity in my life plan.
It's like,

2149
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,600
Eh,
it's coming out of the water and he's

2150
01:35:55,601 --> 01:35:58,110
touching his nose.
No,

2151
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,450
no wonder pirates of fucking scared and
shit.

2152
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,370
They probably dealt with that shit on
the daily.

2153
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,700
You can you imagine.
Can you imagine a pirate fucking ends up

2154
01:36:09,701 --> 01:36:11,920
on,
on the coast of South Africa?

2155
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:14,260
Oh my God.
The stories there.

2156
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:15,401
Yeah.
That's great.

2157
01:36:15,401 --> 01:36:16,900
Let's just hang out there.
They're just.

2158
01:36:16,901 --> 01:36:19,510
They're just a shitload of them.
How insane this is.

2159
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:23,230
This is so insane.
He just keeps opening its mouth and

2160
01:36:23,231 --> 01:36:26,230
those gums.
Look at the gums and on these fucking

2161
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:30,790
destructor teeth.
They are scarier than any monster in any

2162
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:34,240
movie ever,
and they're 100 percent real.

2163
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:37,240
Look at the fucking teeth on that thing,
man.

2164
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:39,340
I mean,
what the hell?

2165
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:43,120
And they fly out of the water.
Oh my God,

2166
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:47,160
Oh my God.
Those things are so insane.

2167
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:50,550
Just imagine that clamping down on you.
I mean it's.

2168
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:55,640
It's cartoonish.
A shark's teeth are cartoonish.

2169
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:00,270
They're giants swords,
cerated edge swords,

2170
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:04,650
and there's rows of them in their mouth.
So if one snaps off,

2171
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:09,920
another one moves forward.
What are just spec tire killer animal.

2172
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,260
Just that one of the craziest creations
of nature

2173
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,990
or thor.
Did he make sharks?

2174
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,590
Was it Odin?
Who makes the sharks?

2175
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:27,520
Who makes sure it was a god which God
would make sharks.

2176
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:28,301
Oh,
I don't know.

2177
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,700
That's a good question.
That fucking thing.

2178
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,840
I can't watch this,
Jamie.

2179
01:37:31,841 --> 01:37:34,120
I'm freaking out.
If I had,

2180
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:38,560
if I had $100,000,000,000,000,
I built this fucking instead of an

2181
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:41,110
octagon.
It's just this giant fucking ocean and

2182
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:44,950
put great white and killer whale in
there to fight killer whales when every

2183
01:37:44,951 --> 01:37:46,480
time you think so.
Every time.

2184
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:49,030
Every time.
Great whites and not smart and they're

2185
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:51,400
not nearly as mobile.
They're not smart.

2186
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:52,610
They just swim around.
How do you.

2187
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,300
How did you dump them in the tank?
How?

2188
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:58,380
What would you never seen videos of?
How long would you think it would take

2189
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:00,470
before the killer whale attack?
The great white.

2190
01:38:00,471 --> 01:38:04,430
You just don't big a quick.
Would you pay to watch sound?

2191
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:07,450
Um,
you can watch on youtube and I'm like

2192
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:08,071
this.
No,

2193
01:38:08,071 --> 01:38:09,980
but can.
There's never any good video of it.

2194
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:14,340
I would never push no good video of a
killer whale jacket.

2195
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,500
It's like splash.
I would say yes,

2196
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:18,360
but you can never put a killer whale in
tank.

2197
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:21,420
I think putting a killer whale on tank
is just beyond 10 minutes.

2198
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:22,161
No,
no,

2199
01:38:22,161 --> 01:38:23,130
no.
You can't do that.

2200
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:25,710
You can't force it to fight.
I think it's like forcing a person to

2201
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:26,800
fight.
It's like picking up the money.

2202
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:28,050
He could do anything.
Okay.

2203
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:31,650
Were you going to go in a helicopter and
pick up some guy from the middle of the

2204
01:38:31,651 --> 01:38:33,960
fucking Bornean jungle and make them
fight in a cage fight?

2205
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:36,650
What'd you do that?
Would you drop them in there with the

2206
01:38:36,651 --> 01:38:39,180
guy who's trying to kick his ass?
Dropped

2207
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,540
that a dog?
That wouldn't.

2208
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:44,010
That wouldn't be that excited.

2209
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:46,470
I'm talking about the most exciting
possible match.

2210
01:38:46,471 --> 01:38:48,300
I know,
but what I'm saying is dolphins and

2211
01:38:48,301 --> 01:38:51,780
whales and killer whales are too smart.
It's fucked up to do that to them.

2212
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:52,910
Oh,
see,

2213
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:53,920
smart.
I see what you're saying.

2214
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:55,080
That's why I would never do it the right
way.

2215
01:38:55,081 --> 01:38:58,590
Would never have a shot.
Maybe they get a fucking rabid one from

2216
01:38:58,591 --> 01:39:01,350
south that they got to find a good one.
We found that good.

2217
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,210
We found a Gamer.
Killer whales,

2218
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,040
I think.
I think they could definitely get the

2219
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:08,760
babies.
Maybe you get a killer whale or a baby

2220
01:39:08,761 --> 01:39:11,460
killer whale and a fucking full grown,
ferocious,

2221
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:12,373
great.

2222
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:17,130
Probably the great white would bite
right through it,

2223
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:18,570
right?
If it was a baby.

2224
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:21,900
When they're grown.
Fully grown adults.

2225
01:39:21,901 --> 01:39:24,810
I think killer whales are bigger and
they were way smarter.

2226
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:27,300
They're just wastes martyr and they just
go right after the sharks.

2227
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:29,070
They go after him.
We decided to fuck them up.

2228
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:30,180
There's a,
um,

2229
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:33,270
the video is this.
Apparently they were watching a mother

2230
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:36,330
and her daughter or son,
the mother and her baby,

2231
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:40,260
and a killer whale.
The killer whale was swimming around

2232
01:39:40,261 --> 01:39:43,140
with this baby and the shark showed up.
And the killer whale was like,

2233
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,390
hold on,
be right back.

2234
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,250
Just went.
Fuck that thing up.

2235
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:47,400
They got that on video.
Yeah.

2236
01:39:47,401 --> 01:39:51,930
They got an a video and then I think the
killer whale shark up,

2237
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:54,880
didn't it bring the shark and display
it?

2238
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:57,960
I'm trying to look it up now.
They're like at a recreated thing of it.

2239
01:39:58,050 --> 01:39:59,730
Oh really?
Because it wasn't that.

2240
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:04,350
They couldn't get the camera down there.
Look how much bigger it is.

2241
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:10,070
See this is the dead shark at the end.
So this is the killer whale.

2242
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:13,230
Biting the fucking shit out of that
shark.

2243
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:16,130
They just don't have real good footage
of how it went down.

2244
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:20,610
Was footage from some discovery channel.
So they faced in probably,

2245
01:40:20,611 --> 01:40:21,580
right.
It's Gleiss.

2246
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:25,560
They do that now when I'm watching them
fucking discovery channel.

2247
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:27,180
It's like,
you're like,

2248
01:40:27,181 --> 01:40:28,830
dude,
there's no way you got that shot.

2249
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:30,680
Right?
You've got that whole thing happening.

2250
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:31,950
You see it.
It seems.

2251
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:35,250
It seems to make now it seems like you
see it now,

2252
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:40,980
but killer whales versus sharks.
I think unless the shark is really big

2253
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:44,820
and the killer whales really young and
then killer was just way too smart.

2254
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,580
They're like,
like a person almost just they don't

2255
01:40:47,581 --> 01:40:50,100
move like us,
so we don't consider them like us,

2256
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,900
but they have crazy language.

2257
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,670
White versus dolphin to killed dolphins.
They eat them.

2258
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:57,040
Great whites killed dolphins.
The Itam.

2259
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,710
Fuck,
I didn't know that shit.

2260
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:00,640
Like Jello.
I thought.

2261
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:02,980
I thought they fuck sharks up.
They do.

2262
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,150
They fucked off chips.
Remember?

2263
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:08,890
Let me make sure I'm correct about them
eating them.

2264
01:41:08,891 --> 01:41:12,400
I know they kill them,
but how could they catch a dolphin?

2265
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:14,320
Maybe that I don't eat them.
They kill them,

2266
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,480
dude.
I'm telling great whites killed off and

2267
01:41:16,481 --> 01:41:18,240
they'd kill whales to.
No,

2268
01:41:18,241 --> 01:41:19,830
not great whites.
No orcas.

2269
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,540
Did we say great wines?
St.

2270
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:22,373
Oh.
Oh,

2271
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,430
killer whales.
Killer whales.

2272
01:41:24,431 --> 01:41:25,470
Dolphins,
for sure.

2273
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:26,980
Great whites do to.
If they can.

2274
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:29,940
If they keep talking about great whites.
I'm tired.

2275
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,250
I thought you said that's so stupid.
I thought you said killer whales,

2276
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:36,130
but for sure a great white.
Ain't gonna kill my dolphin.

2277
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:37,550
Right?
A great white can.

2278
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,740
Yeah.
If they bite him.

2279
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:40,960
Yeah,
they can get them if they fuck up if

2280
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:44,800
somebody fucks up,
but I think that the size difference

2281
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:47,380
between killer whales and great whites
are just too big,

2282
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,770
but it's a very disappointed when you
find out the great whites are the killer

2283
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:52,540
whales rather not great whites.
I keep,

2284
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:56,080
I keep saying great wines that killer
whales are killing dolphins and they

2285
01:41:56,081 --> 01:41:58,060
kill other whales to like,
uh,

2286
01:41:58,061 --> 01:42:00,970
you know,
the Arctic to the North Pole is melting.

2287
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:02,760
Well,
there's like a,

2288
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:06,820
these whales killer whales can't get to
because the ice,

2289
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:09,070
they can hang on the ice because don't
have the dorsal fin or something and

2290
01:42:09,071 --> 01:42:11,820
they can swim through the ice,
but now that all ice is gone kilo.

2291
01:42:11,821 --> 01:42:13,410
Whereas we're coming up to eat them.
Yeah.

2292
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:15,970
Isn't that crazy?
So that they're eating other whales so

2293
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:19,180
much that it's fucking up the Eskimo
economy because they rely on those

2294
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:22,270
because they killed those whales,
but now the killer whales and killing

2295
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:23,290
the whales,
they kill.

2296
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:25,840
Isn't that nuts?
They rely on whales.

2297
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:28,750
They kill
God,

2298
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,300
so they need help.
So I'll need to do something about the

2299
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:33,880
killer whale problem.
How many people were up there?

2300
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:37,150
Did they like it up there?
There's people that are living off

2301
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:38,800
Wales.
Are they enjoying themselves?

2302
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,440
What is it?
What keeps about that?

2303
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:42,710
I've never been there as fence.
Right.

2304
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:47,350
It's funny.
You should come to Phoenix hundred below

2305
01:42:47,351 --> 01:42:48,310
zero.
They're like,

2306
01:42:48,311 --> 01:42:50,540
we're just going to tough it out.
Just not good too.

2307
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,910
It's not good.
Like as far as like the way their,

2308
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:54,070
their,
their health is.

2309
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:57,000
Well it doesn't.
The population doesn't grow at their

2310
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:01,240
kids ended up graduating and saying fuck
that.

2311
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:05,590
Like curtis hambre alcohol.
Boston hadn't structured from Alaska.

2312
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,930
They all get the fuck out.
They don't stay well.

2313
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:10,450
Alaska is one thing,
like anchorage is bad ass,

2314
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:14,560
but this is like the where the people
are eating whales and shit.

2315
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:17,320
They're like north of that now.
They're like way up there.

2316
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:21,730
They like in the frozen parts there's
the anchorage is actually close to the

2317
01:43:21,731 --> 01:43:23,920
coast so it's not a bad place to live.
Yeah.

2318
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:26,140
I've never been to anchorage.
Fucking great man.

2319
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:30,730
Is this like a Vancouver,
like a colder Vancouver where it's only

2320
01:43:31,090 --> 01:43:33,370
dark out for like an hour in the summer.

2321
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,310
It's weird.
You go outside at like 4:00 in the

2322
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:37,330
morning,
it's bright out,

2323
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:40,330
write out like 5:00 at night,
bright out,

2324
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,030
and it's like four in the morning.
You're like,

2325
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:45,400
what the fuck is going on?
A little of that in Sweden because

2326
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:46,430
Sweden,
it's kind of north,

2327
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:50,990
so it's like the sun's still out and
it's 11:00 at night and on the sun is

2328
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,950
stove on your face.
But I didn't.

2329
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,030
Uh,
I've never been that north.

2330
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:58,560
Never been to Alaska.
It's crazy.

2331
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:01,520
Up Live comedy up there to comedy in
Anchorage.

2332
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:05,600
Ari is beautiful as you get a bad ass to
get in some,

2333
01:44:05,601 --> 01:44:09,110
a bow and arrow.
When we were fishing we went salmon

2334
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:12,200
fishing while we're up there.
It's beautiful man.

2335
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:15,260
Just beautiful.
That was the first time I saw an actual

2336
01:44:15,261 --> 01:44:18,710
live in the flesh eagle,
like outside of the zoo,

2337
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:22,250
like watching a big ass eagle fly right
over your head is a trip.

2338
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:24,560
We had an eagle fly,
you know,

2339
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:27,290
shit,
hundred yards over our head.

2340
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,940
They'll take a baby won't,
uh,

2341
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:34,160
they probably avoid people.
But if you leave your kid out in the

2342
01:44:34,161 --> 01:44:34,994
lawn,
yeah,

2343
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:38,590
yeah.
If you just stand back and let you,

2344
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:39,860
if they're hungry.
Oh,

2345
01:44:39,861 --> 01:44:41,150
especially if there's something wrong
with them,

2346
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:43,190
like they're too tired to go get a
salmon.

2347
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:45,590
Like getting old.
I mean equals get old too.

2348
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:49,020
That's when like a lot of animals get
dangerous when they get older.

2349
01:44:49,021 --> 01:44:50,300
Like cats,
big cats.

2350
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:53,150
They get dangerous thing to get older.
They can't catch dogs anymore.

2351
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:54,980
You know?
They're fucking hungry,

2352
01:44:54,981 --> 01:44:56,360
man.
They gotta going to figure something

2353
01:44:56,361 --> 01:44:58,550
out.
Fucking Eagle.

2354
01:44:58,551 --> 01:45:01,880
Taking your baby can imagine how you'd
feel if are you looking at seeing an

2355
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:04,190
eagle fly off with your kid?
There's that video,

2356
01:45:04,191 --> 01:45:05,150
right?
It's fake.

2357
01:45:05,151 --> 01:45:08,570
It's fake.
Believed it.

2358
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:11,030
I believed it.
I believed that.

2359
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,190
I believed that Orangutang fishing
video.

2360
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:16,220
Then I wait a minute so it's not real.
It is real.

2361
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:17,750
He just didn't.
I didn't pull it off,

2362
01:45:17,751 --> 01:45:20,240
but it really was trying to do it.
He rang Tang was.

2363
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:25,220
Yeah man.
There's just so many videos like that

2364
01:45:25,221 --> 01:45:28,100
and so many.
It's hard to know what is right and

2365
01:45:28,101 --> 01:45:31,520
what's not with the photoshopping skills
like photoshop.

2366
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:32,480
Steve.
Oh my God.

2367
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:34,160
Oh Man.
That guy is obsessed.

2368
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:37,070
He's so good.
Like things like that,

2369
01:45:37,071 --> 01:45:38,770
right?
Like you look at those pictures like

2370
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:39,710
okay,
that could be.

2371
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:41,630
That could be real or not real.
Yeah.

2372
01:45:41,631 --> 01:45:42,500
No,
it's so good.

2373
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,060
Some other.
I don't mean Shit.

2374
01:45:44,061 --> 01:45:44,740
Yeah.
Thought about it.

2375
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:46,740
It's really,
really well.

2376
01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:51,650
When is it going to be?
How long is it going to be before we.

2377
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,480
I guess it's probably already happened,
right?

2378
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:56,780
Where they've proven that photographs
that are used in propaganda or are

2379
01:45:56,781 --> 01:45:57,614
faked.

2380
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,810
Must've happened.
Didn't happen.

2381
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:04,280
Like during the Iraq war.
Wasn't there like some faked fake photos

2382
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,840
of missiles or something like that.
God Damn it.

2383
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,180
Why didn't they do that shit all the
time.

2384
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:12,680
The green screen and they pretend
they're in Lebanon and shit when they're

2385
01:46:12,681 --> 01:46:16,400
really in Virginia,
they've been busted pretending they're

2386
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:19,370
in the Iraq war and bombs are going off
and they got helmets on and shit.

2387
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:21,720
They bust to do with that.
Yeah.

2388
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:24,590
They had on youtube.
They left.

2389
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:27,650
The camera's rolling for the tape is
like an hour.

2390
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:32,270
You can go on Youtube during the 91
operation.

2391
01:46:32,271 --> 01:46:37,271
Freedom war there were faking the news.
So ridiculous.

2392
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,610
You know what?
Good for them.

2393
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:44,030
They're supposed to be doing that shit.
They're supposed to be doing that shit.

2394
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:46,280
You run that empire.
You know what I mean?

2395
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:48,640
I don't think that's what they're doing
there.

2396
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:49,640
They're trying to put together.

2397
01:46:49,650 --> 01:46:53,580
They're saving money.
Did tainment trying to put together an

2398
01:46:53,581 --> 01:46:54,450
entertainment.
Hey,

2399
01:46:54,451 --> 01:46:57,570
what about operation?
What about Operation Mockingbird?

2400
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,340
You take that,
that was real.

2401
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,860
And uh,
that was a real.

2402
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:06,890
Which one was that?
The CIA infiltrating a broadcasting and

2403
01:47:08,341 --> 01:47:12,390
journalism and that they take for
propaganda purposes.

2404
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,550
This was a real operation.
Well,

2405
01:47:14,551 --> 01:47:19,350
there's been some real operations that
are undeniable that are pretty fucking

2406
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:22,390
crazy.
And then how crazy is it that a who,

2407
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:23,970
CNN,
you know,

2408
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:28,680
that's this rumor that based on how they
present stuff like that,

2409
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:31,890
based on how it's going down to what
they show and what they're pushing.

2410
01:47:31,891 --> 01:47:33,680
And based on the agenda,
you know,

2411
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:34,770
any,
you know,

2412
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:37,350
any retard will say,
now you can't believe Fox News.

2413
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:40,890
Even retard say that.
Even retard say you can't believe Fox

2414
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:41,760
News.
Everybody knows that.

2415
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,140
Well,
CNN just like that.

2416
01:47:43,141 --> 01:47:45,570
It's just the other side.
So that's easy to bleed in.

2417
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:48,120
The Anderson Cooper was in the CIA.
He denied it for a long time.

2418
01:47:48,121 --> 01:47:51,420
Then he came out and said I was just
there for a summer intern.

2419
01:47:51,421 --> 01:47:52,590
Right.
Is that what you said?

2420
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:55,500
Once you're in,
you're in,

2421
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:59,540
you know,
at first,

2422
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:04,640
and then his family comes from super,
super wealthy background.

2423
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:07,620
The vanderbilts and all that should have
taught me.

2424
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:08,940
It's like,
I don't know.

2425
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:10,370
I was going to say,
um,

2426
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:13,890
the other one that's really crazy.
His operation midnight climax.

2427
01:48:13,891 --> 01:48:15,050
You ever hear about that one?
Nope.

2428
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:18,990
The government ran brothels in San
Francisco,

2429
01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:23,700
in New York and they got guys who came
in to get laid and they dosed them with

2430
01:48:23,701 --> 01:48:27,510
Lsd so they could study them because a
conspiracy theory.

2431
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:27,961
No,
no,

2432
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:29,940
that's real.
That's 100 percent real freedom of

2433
01:48:29,941 --> 01:48:34,941
information act operation midnight.
Climax how the CIA dose San Francisco

2434
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,950
citizens with Lsd and how crazy does
that sound?

2435
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,380
How Craig,
if we said that happened today,

2436
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:42,510
like what is going on today?
It would be.

2437
01:48:42,511 --> 01:48:45,390
You would be thought as a crazy man,
but it's happened before and unless

2438
01:48:45,391 --> 01:48:46,470
that's not true.
No,

2439
01:48:46,471 --> 01:48:47,190
no,
this is true.

2440
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:50,880
Well then it happened before
so I could read it.

2441
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:52,200
Here it goes.
You're crazy.

2442
01:48:52,201 --> 01:48:56,130
If you think through it again,
lifts it up so you're considered nuts.

2443
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:58,890
That's crazier than any conspiracy
theory I believe,

2444
01:48:58,891 --> 01:49:01,000
and that's the craziest one.
Listen to what it says.

2445
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:02,490
It's been over 50 years,
but Wayne,

2446
01:49:02,491 --> 01:49:05,640
Richie says he can still remember how it
felt to be dosed with acid.

2447
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:09,630
He was drinking Bourbon and soda with
other federal officers on a holiday

2448
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:14,631
party in 1957 at the US post office
building on seventh and mission streets.

2449
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,280
They were cracking jokes and swapping
stories.

2450
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:20,370
Suddenly the room began to spin.
The Red and green lights on the

2451
01:49:20,371 --> 01:49:23,160
Christmas tree in the corner spiraled
wildly.

2452
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:27,930
Richie's body temperature rose,
his gaze fixed on the dizzying colors

2453
01:49:27,931 --> 01:49:28,870
around it.

2454
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,020
It got jagged.
Somebody dosed them,

2455
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,750
but that's not.
This is in this.

2456
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,580
This guy is not the guy I think this is.
He's talking about being dosed at a

2457
01:49:44,581 --> 01:49:46,290
party.
He's not talking about operation

2458
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:50,170
midnight climax
because midnight climax was about

2459
01:49:50,171 --> 01:49:51,760
brothels.
That's why they were calling it

2460
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:56,410
operation midnight climax and they found
this guy about getting feeling.

2461
01:49:57,050 --> 01:49:58,060
Yeah,
he definitely,

2462
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:00,910
well he's a,
let's see here,

2463
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:04,180
say when he was high they were
participating against their will in

2464
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:05,920
these studies is what it was
essentially,

2465
01:50:06,030 --> 01:50:07,560
whatever.
Just go google into it,

2466
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,420
look into it folks Google into it.
I don't think that's a real term,

2467
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:13,690
but it's really interesting because what
had happened was they were doing these

2468
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:16,090
studies on soldiers and they just
couldn't get people to do it anymore.

2469
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:19,210
People like get the fuck Outta here.
Like they didn't want to do it anymore.

2470
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:22,990
So then they started to figure,
let's just try it on some other people.

2471
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,600
They figured if they did it in a
whorehouse,

2472
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:26,310
nobody would say anything.
You know,

2473
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:28,150
guys don't want to admit they were there
in the first place.

2474
01:50:28,151 --> 01:50:30,550
Just dose them up with an asset.
They walk out of there all crazy.

2475
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:34,030
Not Stupid Smart.
Goddammit.

2476
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:37,060
They do a lot of smart fucking shit.
God Damn it.

2477
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:39,820
It's all setup so brilliant.
Brilliantly.

2478
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:43,200
I mean,
just the fact everybody knows that the.

2479
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,600
There's a corruption at the,
at the,

2480
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:49,090
at the top levels and the CIA.
Not on everybody,

2481
01:50:49,091 --> 01:50:52,510
but there's a lot of corrupt.
Everybody knows that and it's okay.

2482
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:55,270
It's like the,
the people that are really running shit

2483
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:59,860
like the corporations and the
international bankers like they blew the

2484
01:50:59,861 --> 01:51:04,861
CIA is right there with nobody to a sue.
No one to throw in jail.

2485
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:07,850
No one's accountable.
It's just right there.

2486
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:09,550
Just that they're involved in all this
shit.

2487
01:51:09,551 --> 01:51:10,910
Just like what you just posted.
They're involved in.

2488
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:12,460
I shouldn't.
No one's accountable.

2489
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:13,560
Well,
you know what I think is going to

2490
01:51:13,561 --> 01:51:17,200
happen.
What I think what I see as possible to

2491
01:51:17,201 --> 01:51:19,650
happen.
The same thing that's happening with a

2492
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:24,730
performance enhancing drugs in the UFC.
That was someone like Jeff Novitsky when

2493
01:51:24,731 --> 01:51:26,980
they have these Usada guys that are just

2494
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,430
showing up at your house,
4:00 in the morning,

2495
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:33,430
take random tests.
They have all these crazy things they

2496
01:51:33,431 --> 01:51:35,560
could test for that no one even knew
about.

2497
01:51:35,650 --> 01:51:38,740
You know,
so slowly but surely,

2498
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:42,730
everybody's forced to be natural and
compete naturally and that's what we're

2499
01:51:42,731 --> 01:51:44,120
seeing right now in the UFC.
You just,

2500
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:45,160
just,
just too,

2501
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:47,800
it's too risky.
They are too good for too sophisticated.

2502
01:51:47,801 --> 01:51:48,970
Right?
So as far as we know,

2503
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:52,180
everybody's fighting natural,
but we also know that they definitely

2504
01:51:52,181 --> 01:51:54,280
didn't.
They cheated like a motherfucker.

2505
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:56,950
Everybody did in other organizations.
We know that.

2506
01:51:56,951 --> 01:51:59,520
We know guys who did it,
we know guys that would just be juiced

2507
01:51:59,521 --> 01:52:01,960
out of their fucking mind and everybody
else was juiced out of their mind to.

2508
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:05,530
And that's how the game was being done.
Everybody was competing on that level.

2509
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:08,110
So we know that.
So in a lot of ways,

2510
01:52:09,070 --> 01:52:12,610
I think that's because of something
like,

2511
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:13,520
you know,
the,

2512
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:17,670
the new understanding of how to test
people and something like the UFC high

2513
01:52:17,671 --> 01:52:19,000
Reno Wicki to go after this.

2514
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,590
Right?
But that's data,

2515
01:52:20,591 --> 01:52:21,610
right?
It's information,

2516
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:23,230
all that information as it does come
out,

2517
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,540
they're forced to do it straight and
narrow.

2518
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:28,120
I think that's going to be the case with
government at a certain point in time.

2519
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:30,860
I think the people that are making a
fuck load of money and corporations,

2520
01:52:30,861 --> 01:52:32,470
they're going to make a fuck load of
money anyway,

2521
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:36,400
but they're not going to be able to
manipulate environmental law the way

2522
01:52:36,401 --> 01:52:39,040
they're doing now and get away with it.
It'll be more transparent.

2523
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:43,540
They're not be able to influence
politicians to influence laws to make it

2524
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:46,010
favor their business.
It just won't able to do it so easily.

2525
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,110
I think there's always going to be money
to be made.

2526
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:51,840
There's always going to be people buying
cars and buildings and they're almost

2527
01:52:51,850 --> 01:52:56,660
always going to be commerce,
but I think there'll be less fuckery in

2528
01:52:56,661 --> 01:52:57,494
the future.

2529
01:52:57,570 --> 01:53:00,530
I think corporate fuckery,
they're still going.

2530
01:53:01,030 --> 01:53:03,080
I don't think.
I don't think you can hide things

2531
01:53:03,081 --> 01:53:08,081
forever when it comes to like some of
the practices that some corporations

2532
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:11,240
that are unscrupulous will engage in
that aren't necessarily ethical.

2533
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:13,520
Like how about the BP oil spill,
right?

2534
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,630
Like how about how the other,
you know,

2535
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:19,850
the way they cleaned it up and the um,
they made people.

2536
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:24,150
There's people in that town that mean
what does,

2537
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:28,040
how much of a loss was that to them?
How could you possibly compensate them

2538
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:29,810
for?
I don't know too much about the BP oil

2539
01:53:29,811 --> 01:53:32,600
spill.
BP oil spill is pretty fucking crazy.

2540
01:53:32,601 --> 01:53:35,300
I know it killed the Gulf and all that,
but I don't know the details.

2541
01:53:35,301 --> 01:53:37,460
I don't know.
There was some kind of,

2542
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,320
you know,
of the report.

2543
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:41,000
I don't know anything about having
looked into it.

2544
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,350
It was one of those,
um,

2545
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,220
things that they pull the oil out of the
ground,

2546
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:47,870
those bloated.
She had a lot of animals and it's just a

2547
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:52,871
lot of industry and oil into the ocean.
Yeah,

2548
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:58,730
it's crazy.
It's amazing how many gallons were being

2549
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:01,490
pumped into the ocean and even more
amazing how the ocean just sort of

2550
01:54:01,491 --> 01:54:03,740
absorbs it.
What do you think a trump.

2551
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:05,990
That's a long question.

2552
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:10,120
I think it's,
uh,

2553
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:11,960
it's,
this is a strange time.

2554
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:15,500
It's strange to see a president that is
okay,

2555
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:19,160
whatever.
What do you like him or don't like him?

2556
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:22,970
Whether you support his beliefs or you
think he's the worst thing ever?

2557
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:27,050
I'm just looking at it as objectively,
like as a performance piece.

2558
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:33,040
There's never been a guy that
understands how to manipulate the media

2559
01:54:34,551 --> 01:54:35,720
the way he does.
Never.

2560
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:38,120
No one even close.
He made everything he does is a big

2561
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:41,120
story.
He says outrageous things and because he

2562
01:54:41,121 --> 01:54:43,520
says outrageous things,
they tune in to make sure he says more

2563
01:54:43,521 --> 01:54:46,100
outrageous things.
The more outrageous things he says,

2564
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:48,620
the more people go.
He's saying outrageous things.

2565
01:54:48,621 --> 01:54:51,140
Let's tune in.
He's the biggest show in town,

2566
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:54,170
like it's not even close,
so I'm in close.

2567
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:59,200
Who generates more attention?
Who's got people more riled up about it?

2568
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:01,700
People are bored as fuck.

2569
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:04,010
They're bored,
they're bored.

2570
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:06,770
They hired Obama,
they thought everything was gonna change

2571
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:10,010
and it,
I guess did a little on some fronts and

2572
01:55:10,011 --> 01:55:13,130
it was good socially and the world's
evolving in that way,

2573
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:14,840
in that direction anyway,
so that's all good.

2574
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:20,270
But Guantanamo Bay still open.
People are still in Afghanistan.

2575
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:21,470
Seems like the,
you know,

2576
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:23,690
it's still.
It's still chaos everywhere.

2577
01:55:23,691 --> 01:55:25,160
I don't know if anybody could have ever
fixed it,

2578
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:26,910
right?
We're,

2579
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:29,000
we're just bored.
We're bored.

2580
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,800
What is this?
What are we doing?

2581
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:32,660
What is this world?
Why are we in the Middle East?

2582
01:55:32,661 --> 01:55:33,450
What is going on?
Why?

2583
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:35,180
I'd have to worry about war,
why don't have to worry about gas?

2584
01:55:35,290 --> 01:55:36,530
Why don't have to worry about global
warming?

2585
01:55:36,531 --> 01:55:37,640
What's going to happen with the polar
bears?

2586
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:40,070
God Damn it.
And then all of a sudden this guy comes

2587
01:55:40,071 --> 01:55:41,600
along and telling you how big his dick
is.

2588
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,220
He says,
I'm going to build up a fucking

2589
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:48,040
wall,
a million miles high Mexicans out joey

2590
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,930
the first of all they built,
they didn't finish already put up a

2591
01:55:51,931 --> 01:55:53,370
wall.
It's crazy.

2592
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:55,520
And everybody cheers,
you know.

2593
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:57,570
And the Mexican president calls me up
and says,

2594
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:00,150
who's going to pay for that wall?
You're going to pay for that wall.

2595
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:04,110
And the wall just got 10 feet higher and
hangs up the phone and everybody's

2596
01:56:04,111 --> 01:56:07,110
cheering.
Pulls his dick just off.

2597
01:56:08,150 --> 01:56:08,983
Yes.
Yeah.

2598
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:11,280
He told the guy the wall just got 10
feet higher.

2599
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,130
You know what I told him?
The Wall just got 10 feet higher.

2600
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:16,160
And everybody goes,
Oh,

2601
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:18,600
I'd love to see that cloud.
Could you find that class?

2602
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:21,720
Like he's like a,
a movie from the eighties.

2603
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:25,920
And yesterday the top person,
president of Mexico said,

2604
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:31,460
we will never ever pay for that wall.
And the press called me up and they

2605
01:56:32,521 --> 01:56:33,930
said,
call her on the head,

2606
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,670
man,
top person.

2607
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:38,010
He said he won't pay.
He won't pay for it.

2608
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:43,390
And you know what I said,
I said the wall just got 10 feet higher.

2609
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:45,023
Right?

2610
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:49,470
He fucked it up.
I keep saying it's true.

2611
01:56:49,471 --> 01:56:50,400
It's true.
It's true.

2612
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:56,390
He's so strange is it's just so bizarre.
I feel like I feel like almost like I'm

2613
01:56:57,421 --> 01:57:01,230
watching like one of them late night
televangelists shows somebody wants,

2614
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,240
wants your money.
Like you can have my money.

2615
01:57:03,241 --> 01:57:04,980
Look at you.
You do already have money.

2616
01:57:04,981 --> 01:57:05,814
You can't get money.

2617
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:11,090
It's feels like

2618
01:57:11,410 --> 01:57:14,600
fake.
It feels like this is the final piece of

2619
01:57:14,601 --> 01:57:16,550
the simulation theory.
Yeah.

2620
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:20,780
The final piece of the show where it's
going to reveal that this has all been a

2621
01:57:20,781 --> 01:57:23,600
comedy all along.
I've been a strange comedy.

2622
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:25,640
I mean,
what do you think?

2623
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:28,940
He's really a.
he's better than the other ones except

2624
01:57:28,941 --> 01:57:32,090
for Bernie.
He's better than all the other people on

2625
01:57:32,091 --> 01:57:33,740
the Republican side.
I mean,

2626
01:57:33,741 --> 01:57:36,820
Marco Rubio seems like a,
a,

2627
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:39,530
a reasonable guy.
And a lot of ways the way talks.

2628
01:57:39,590 --> 01:57:42,320
I don't know exactly what he's uh,
his beliefs are,

2629
01:57:42,321 --> 01:57:44,990
but him and trunk,
they get into these insult competitions

2630
01:57:44,991 --> 01:57:48,300
and it looked so foolish.
So like just because trump does it,

2631
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,010
just don't do it better than him.
Don't do it better than him.

2632
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:56,730
Talk about how ridiculous it is and
don't allow that guy to like you.

2633
01:57:56,750 --> 01:57:59,900
They're talking about a big as hands are
and they're going back and forth with

2634
01:57:59,901 --> 01:58:04,190
each other and insulting his hair and
insulting a spray tan I like.

2635
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:06,470
They're like,
it's like the roasting against each

2636
01:58:06,471 --> 01:58:08,120
other.
Like this is not presidential.

2637
01:58:08,750 --> 01:58:11,460
I understand you guys have a limited
amount of time and this with

2638
01:58:12,970 --> 01:58:17,000
the fake Tan and trump was bagging on
rubio wearing makeup.

2639
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:20,570
The whole thing is ridiculous.
Like this is a terrible way to have

2640
01:58:20,571 --> 01:58:23,870
these people together.
Like to have these people all competing.

2641
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:28,370
Then what you're going to get is who's
the best at giving you a sound byte

2642
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:30,830
under pressure.
You're not going to get who's the best

2643
01:58:30,831 --> 01:58:34,040
leader you're going to get to.
Who's the best at doing that debate

2644
01:58:34,041 --> 01:58:36,770
thing that's you're going to get because
it's a weird thing.

2645
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:40,070
You're standing up there on a podium,
you're right next to a guy was talking

2646
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:42,730
shit about you.
What he's saying is not even true and

2647
01:58:42,731 --> 01:58:43,840
you're like,
you can even respond.

2648
01:58:43,841 --> 01:58:45,640
You've gotta wait like fuck you man.

2649
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:49,060
It's a stupid way to talk,
and the fact that they time them,

2650
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:50,470
they give them like ready,
go.

2651
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:51,730
No,
this is what you do.

2652
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:53,380
You let them talk for long period of
time.

2653
01:58:53,381 --> 01:58:56,890
If they're long winded and boring,
people don't like them anymore.

2654
01:58:57,010 --> 01:58:59,650
That's what happens.
You put them in a long form,

2655
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:03,280
have them talk for hours and hours.
Let him talk on a podcast.

2656
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:07,120
Every fucking presidential candidate
should have a long form podcasts that

2657
01:59:07,121 --> 01:59:11,450
they have to do every day and we see
whether or not people want to listen to

2658
01:59:11,451 --> 01:59:13,330
you.
Not like have someone barking at you on

2659
01:59:13,331 --> 01:59:15,940
the left and bar.
Tell me what the fuck you can do and

2660
01:59:15,941 --> 01:59:19,710
then have someone talk to them that
understands what can and can't be done.

2661
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:24,100
Have someone who's a real political
expert sitting down and asking them some

2662
01:59:24,101 --> 01:59:28,750
hard questions and do it all the time
and that end based on that and their

2663
01:59:28,751 --> 01:59:32,350
qualifications,
but based on like back and forth,

2664
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:33,100
bullshit.

2665
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,570
Bickering with each other and insulting
each other on our spray tans and your.

2666
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:38,920
That's so crazy.
This is the,

2667
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,680
you guys are going to run the greatest
army the world has ever known and you're

2668
01:59:41,681 --> 01:59:44,530
acting like assholes.
This is so stupid.

2669
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:47,050
Like this isn't just like a bunch of
guys,

2670
01:59:47,190 --> 01:59:48,100
uh,
you know,

2671
01:59:48,101 --> 01:59:50,000
trying to win a game show.
This is,

2672
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:52,570
if you,
when you run the world,

2673
01:59:52,890 --> 01:59:55,180
like in your,
you're insulting each other on makeup

2674
01:59:55,181 --> 01:59:56,860
and Tan.
You should be saying,

2675
01:59:56,861 --> 02:00:00,130
do you know how fucking stupid it is
that we're talking about?

2676
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:03,790
We have a five minute time period that
you get to talk in or whatever the fuck

2677
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:05,170
it is.
And you're going to spend your time

2678
02:00:05,210 --> 02:00:08,950
assaulting each other on hand size.
And you guys are babies.

2679
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:10,240
You know,
you can't be the king.

2680
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,320
No,
you guys are not the,

2681
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:12,820
there's no way you could be the best.

2682
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:17,080
So like he ends involved in that.
And Ted Cruz is like super religious,

2683
02:00:17,081 --> 02:00:18,160
which always makes me go,
man,

2684
02:00:18,161 --> 02:00:21,490
I don't know about that.
Ben Carson is super reasonable,

2685
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:23,470
but super religious.
This,

2686
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:27,520
he's the trump is the guy that stands
out is at least he's a rich guy.

2687
02:00:27,521 --> 02:00:29,610
That doesn't give a fuck.
Are there anything,

2688
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:32,260
uh,
any good things that trump says that you

2689
02:00:32,261 --> 02:00:33,770
agree with?
Um,

2690
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:34,623
you know what,
man,

2691
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:39,010
I honestly have been so blown away by
the bad things that he said that I

2692
02:00:39,070 --> 02:00:40,870
barely paid attention to the good
things,

2693
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:45,130
but the shit that he said about Mexico,
like someone's doing all the raping,

2694
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:47,830
like bringing over a murderers and
rapists.

2695
02:00:47,831 --> 02:00:49,090
And I was like,
oh my God,

2696
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:51,010
like you just,
that's a whole country.

2697
02:00:51,011 --> 02:00:53,440
You're talking about millions of people
you're talking about,

2698
02:00:53,441 --> 02:00:55,120
you know,
like most someone's doing the raping.

2699
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:58,570
He says some crazy shit and it works
man.

2700
02:00:58,570 --> 02:01:01,030
It works as far as like,
if it's all a pr campaign.

2701
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:03,220
And he just gets in there and he says,
ladies and gentlemen,

2702
02:01:03,221 --> 02:01:04,270
look,
I said what I said,

2703
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:07,840
and I did what I did to prove a point
that our media system is corrupt.

2704
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:11,020
This whole system is broken.
It needs to be fixed.

2705
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:13,390
It's like a,
it's like a bad computer.

2706
02:01:13,391 --> 02:01:15,280
It needs to be rebuilt.
This is not good.

2707
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:18,310
Like you can't have a guy just juke the
system like I just did.

2708
02:01:18,710 --> 02:01:21,460
That's what would be the most amazing
thing if he gets into office and said

2709
02:01:21,461 --> 02:01:23,740
this is a very important position,
so no more insults,

2710
02:01:23,741 --> 02:01:25,540
no more bullshit,
and now that I'm here,

2711
02:01:25,541 --> 02:01:27,070
I'm going to hide,
just hire the best people and we try to

2712
02:01:27,071 --> 02:01:28,540
figure out what the fuck's wrong with
this country.

2713
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:30,040
How amazing would that be?
He said,

2714
02:01:30,041 --> 02:01:30,851
look,
I had an insult,

2715
02:01:30,851 --> 02:01:34,060
these dummies in order to get in there,
I couldn't let Hillary Talk Shit.

2716
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:38,290
I had to go in there guns blazing and I
had to take out Ben Sanders and fucking

2717
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:40,580
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
But now that all that's done,

2718
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:42,500
we can all work together.
What do you think,

2719
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:44,450
Hillary?
What is your.

2720
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:49,820
I don't know.
I don't know how you can be entrenched

2721
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:55,030
in the system for as long as she's been
entrenched in the system and not be not

2722
02:01:57,501 --> 02:01:59,030
be the,
the past.

2723
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:00,530
That's the system,
right?

2724
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:05,560
The system is these special interest
groups and lobbyists and making deals

2725
02:02:07,671 --> 02:02:08,660
and having,
you know,

2726
02:02:08,661 --> 02:02:10,750
sitting down with all these people at
these tables.

2727
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:13,910
In one hand she knows more about
government than any of them.

2728
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:19,040
She knows more about government than for
sure trump,

2729
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:21,110
right?
I mean he knows about influence.

2730
02:02:21,111 --> 02:02:24,590
He knows how to influence politicians.
He donates money to politicians,

2731
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:28,240
he understands all that,
but as far as like being in the board

2732
02:02:28,241 --> 02:02:29,900
rooms,
when the shit goes down,

2733
02:02:29,901 --> 02:02:32,390
Hillary's like,
she's been like right in there.

2734
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:37,430
So as far as like qualifications,
no one's got more qualifications for

2735
02:02:37,431 --> 02:02:41,900
president than Hillary does.
The problem is do you.

2736
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:44,390
Here's here.
We all agree.

2737
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:46,610
I think we all agree,
and this is not a knock against Hillary.

2738
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:48,950
This is.
We all agree that this system is fucked.

2739
02:02:48,951 --> 02:02:50,690
It's ridiculous.
Representative government,

2740
02:02:50,691 --> 02:02:54,290
it's kind of crazy.
The idea that you can have a bunch of

2741
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:56,050
people.
They vote and they vote for one person.

2742
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:58,130
That person represents that state and
then the state,

2743
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:01,340
they'll get the gun and they try to pick
the president of the electoral college

2744
02:03:01,341 --> 02:03:03,740
and all of its wackiness.
We all agree that that's kind of crazy,

2745
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:05,900
right?
We all agree it doesn't make much sense.

2746
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:07,700
There's a lot of things we don't get to
vote on.

2747
02:03:07,850 --> 02:03:10,310
There's a lot of decisions.
The country goes one way or another way

2748
02:03:10,311 --> 02:03:13,490
that we were really unhappy with and it
would be nice if we had like a giant

2749
02:03:13,491 --> 02:03:14,510
public debate.

2750
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:18,290
So the only person that's going to
change that,

2751
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:22,040
the only person who's going to knock
that off its ass is trump because he's

2752
02:03:22,041 --> 02:03:25,160
the only guy who's got his own money
like that from the Republican side.

2753
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:28,220
He's the only guy in the,
the in the democratic side.

2754
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:31,520
Hillary's got a shitload of money,
but she's kind of a part of the system.

2755
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,410
And Bernie Sanders,
you know,

2756
02:03:33,411 --> 02:03:36,860
he's got some good ideas socially wants
to make marijuana legal,

2757
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:38,330
you know,
he wants to,

2758
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:40,460
wants to help people,
wants to,

2759
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:45,290
wants to unite us,
wants to pay for student education,

2760
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:48,890
which I think is a great idea.
Wants to raise up the minimum wage.

2761
02:03:48,891 --> 02:03:51,560
I think that's a great idea to.
Even though I don't know shit about

2762
02:03:51,561 --> 02:03:55,250
economics,
so it's like there's not a lot of great

2763
02:03:55,251 --> 02:03:56,600
choices,
I guess.

2764
02:03:56,601 --> 02:03:58,940
Like Hillary would be the best choice on
paper.

2765
02:03:59,210 --> 02:04:03,890
She's been there right on paper or
paper.

2766
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:06,110
She's a crook.
I think she's a crook.

2767
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:09,590
Do you know where on the air,
like when I was that bad?

2768
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:12,130
This is live isn't a debate talking,
right?

2769
02:04:12,170 --> 02:04:12,800
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2770
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,660
But you can't say just a crutch.
Got To say allegedly.

2771
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:16,010
Allegedly.
Allegedly.

2772
02:04:16,050 --> 02:04:17,450
What?
What makes you say allegedly she's a

2773
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:18,980
criminal man.
Let's that.

2774
02:04:18,981 --> 02:04:22,640
The documentary,
the Clinton chronicles and all the stuff

2775
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:23,474
that,
you know,

2776
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:25,490
the Whitewater scandal and all that
stuff.

2777
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:27,430
I mean,
she's,

2778
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:29,990
she's in the Bilderberg group.
Come on.

2779
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:30,650
She,
she,

2780
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:32,720
she's deep and bill are deep,
deep,

2781
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:34,320
deep.
That's not a conspiracy.

2782
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:37,100
If they're raising the Bilderberg group.
Bilderberg group is not a conspiracy

2783
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,093
anymore.

2784
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:41,580
The Rothschild's or the.
The rockefellers referred to it as the

2785
02:04:41,581 --> 02:04:44,040
Bilderberg group.
They started it.

2786
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:48,660
It's,
they flaunt it now and she's at her and

2787
02:04:48,661 --> 02:04:50,670
bill.
They're very powerful and they're deep,

2788
02:04:50,671 --> 02:04:53,610
deep,
deep in the top there way up there.

2789
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:57,990
They needed bill to run everything
through Arkansas.

2790
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:02,880
They had to bring them in to
run everything through Arkansas.

2791
02:05:02,881 --> 02:05:05,490
That's not a conspiracy theory.
They ran all their stuff through

2792
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:08,280
Arkansas.
They needed the governor to cooperate

2793
02:05:08,281 --> 02:05:12,030
and that was Bill Clinton and to show
their appreciation to became the next

2794
02:05:12,031 --> 02:05:14,460
president.
He went from Arkansas obscure.

2795
02:05:15,290 --> 02:05:18,870
Then he went to.
Now he's part of the Bilderberg group

2796
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:21,150
just like that.
Some Arkansas governor.

2797
02:05:21,151 --> 02:05:26,151
Just like that dude.
That a narcos on Netflix.

2798
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:27,660
Yeah.
I finally finished.

2799
02:05:27,661 --> 02:05:28,560
It.
Did come on.

2800
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,540
God,
I wouldn't have.

2801
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:32,100
I wouldn't have gotten into it if it
wasn't for you.

2802
02:05:32,101 --> 02:05:33,390
I really wasn't interested in it.

2803
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:34,950
Oh,
I just was like,

2804
02:05:34,951 --> 02:05:36,570
oh yeah.
More drug stuff.

2805
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,090
You got to trust me more.
Oh my God.

2806
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:42,180
I trust you.
Tell land is area cartel.

2807
02:05:42,181 --> 02:05:45,010
Land is next hole.
The only one sounds.

2808
02:05:45,011 --> 02:05:48,240
It sounds like a generic run of the mill
documentary.

2809
02:05:48,241 --> 02:05:49,620
It's not,
it's special.

2810
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:54,110
It's special documentary that sort of
blow your mind and again that uh,

2811
02:05:54,111 --> 02:05:57,480
how big oil conquered the world.
Like the history of the rockefellers.

2812
02:05:57,940 --> 02:06:00,500
Fuck
man.

2813
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:01,980
The craziest shit.
Netflix.

2814
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:03,520
That's where it all came through right
now.

2815
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:04,520
That's where it all.
It's like,

2816
02:06:04,521 --> 02:06:06,090
you know what I mean,
conspiracy there.

2817
02:06:06,091 --> 02:06:09,200
So wherever you want to call now they
claim that it's all connected.

2818
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:10,440
Nine slash 11,
and JFK,

2819
02:06:10,441 --> 02:06:13,330
like it's the same people and they're
all connected with the same families.

2820
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:15,640
The same secret society that goes back.
Well,

2821
02:06:15,641 --> 02:06:20,130
it's most of it.
Most of it started with John d

2822
02:06:20,130 --> 02:06:22,390
Rockefeller and standard oil.

2823
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:25,830
When you learn that shit,
holy fuck the history.

2824
02:06:25,950 --> 02:06:27,450
And you know,
the craziest thing about the whole thing

2825
02:06:27,451 --> 02:06:31,290
is he was so into monopolizing oil and
everything.

2826
02:06:31,291 --> 02:06:33,300
Once it was,
it wasn't just oil banking.

2827
02:06:33,301 --> 02:06:36,240
He got into everything,
big farm and he had controlled

2828
02:06:36,270 --> 02:06:39,720
everything he was showed.
John Rockefeller was so dominant,

2829
02:06:39,721 --> 02:06:41,160
he was playing with the first
billionaire.

2830
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:43,740
He was ruling the world man.
And uh,

2831
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:48,540
the one thing is that all hemp or
marijuana conspiracy theories,

2832
02:06:48,870 --> 02:06:51,780
they all are aware of the reefer madness
propaganda.

2833
02:06:51,781 --> 02:06:54,050
We all know that as,
as we'd uh,

2834
02:06:54,090 --> 02:06:57,180
enthusiasts,
we know about the propaganda that the

2835
02:06:57,181 --> 02:06:57,900
government,
you know,

2836
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:00,770
and then finally they worked after 10
years of all this,

2837
02:07:00,970 --> 02:07:03,450
uh,
propaganda that made we'd look like a

2838
02:07:03,451 --> 02:07:05,430
killer deal and stuff and made you do
crazy shit.

2839
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:09,540
They made it illegal and we all know
that that's from big industry like

2840
02:07:09,541 --> 02:07:11,250
dupont and the rockefellers and all
that.

2841
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:13,020
We all know that,
that they were trying to shut down the

2842
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:14,850
industry,
that we're blaming it on this Mexican

2843
02:07:14,851 --> 02:07:16,920
smoking weed.
But we all know that as we'd

2844
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:19,020
enthusiasts,
but you know what,

2845
02:07:19,021 --> 02:07:22,460
you don't know,
you alcohol prohibition was also a

2846
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:25,260
because of John Rockefeller.
He was,

2847
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:30,410
he supported anti alcohol groups and
blew them up and donated millions to

2848
02:07:30,691 --> 02:07:35,530
blow them up to get to outlaw alcohol
because he thought this is a threat to

2849
02:07:35,531 --> 02:07:37,840
gasoline.
Oh yes.

2850
02:07:37,870 --> 02:07:42,490
And this is not a conspiracy theory.
Alcohol prohibition was all backed by a

2851
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:46,240
John d Dot Rockefeller who was a threat
to gasoline.

2852
02:07:46,241 --> 02:07:47,140
Yes.
Alcohol,

2853
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:49,090
because they thought people are gonna
make like ethanol.

2854
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:49,781
No,
no,

2855
02:07:49,781 --> 02:07:50,060
no,
they,

2856
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:53,860
he just wanted a band at the.
He didn't want her to crush the ethanol

2857
02:07:53,861 --> 02:07:54,510
business.
Right,

2858
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:55,360
right.
So,

2859
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:59,130
but the way he did it is to create this
hysteria with drink.

2860
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:00,450
We,
everyone has a drinking problem and

2861
02:08:00,690 --> 02:08:01,540
killing each other.

2862
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:04,480
So he did the same thing.
He did both of them.

2863
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:08,080
You're going to find out about this.
This is not a conspiracy theory.

2864
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:10,600
So He.
So they made a,

2865
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:13,170
they wore their worship.
Yes.

2866
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:15,880
Quickly how big oil conquered the world.
But,

2867
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:19,280
but he,
he funded a,

2868
02:08:19,410 --> 02:08:23,680
the Anti Saloon League.
It was run by one of his good friends

2869
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:25,840
and that was took and you know what
ended up happening,

2870
02:08:25,841 --> 02:08:28,210
the same thing.
They outlawed alcohol,

2871
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:30,610
you can drink alcohol,
but they said what about the alcohol for

2872
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:33,640
cars?
And they wrote in the law that you could

2873
02:08:33,641 --> 02:08:37,630
still make alcohol for cars,
but you got to put petroleum in it so

2874
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:41,470
that people don't drink it.
So it made it killed the business.

2875
02:08:41,471 --> 02:08:45,820
So now they got to put oil in it if you
want to sell it and then it killed it

2876
02:08:45,821 --> 02:08:46,990
killed off.
He do.

2877
02:08:46,991 --> 02:08:49,750
He killed everything and he got busted
for everything.

2878
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:51,880
John D Dot Rockefeller.
His Dad was named,

2879
02:08:52,030 --> 02:08:54,070
they called them devil bill.
His Dad,

2880
02:08:54,071 --> 02:08:56,980
they know all about is that this is not
a conspiracy theory or their family.

2881
02:08:56,981 --> 02:08:58,450
Historians will tell you about his
father.

2882
02:08:58,451 --> 02:09:03,070
He created him.
He was a rapist snake oil salesman

2883
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:07,990
running from the law changed his name
Bill Devil Bill.

2884
02:09:07,991 --> 02:09:10,330
That was his name,
so he had a bunch of sons and John d

2885
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:12,610
Rockefeller was one and he was known he
wanted to.

2886
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:15,820
He was quoted as saying,
I cheap my sons every day.

2887
02:09:15,821 --> 02:09:20,200
I want them to see a sharp as can be.
He just beat the living fuck,

2888
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:22,810
trust out of them and just drowned all
their trust.

2889
02:09:23,010 --> 02:09:24,670
So he,
John D Rockefeller,

2890
02:09:24,671 --> 02:09:26,700
grew up not trusting anybody will do
this.

2891
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:29,710
Rockefeller,
Ford and the secret history of alcohol.

2892
02:09:30,590 --> 02:09:32,930
Wow.
The secret history regarding alcohol

2893
02:09:32,931 --> 02:09:36,140
that you won't hear on the 6:00 news
cars and everything else running on

2894
02:09:36,141 --> 02:09:41,141
internal combustion engines can run on
alcohol at least as well as they can run

2895
02:09:41,151 --> 02:09:42,380
on gasoline.
Indeed,

2896
02:09:42,381 --> 02:09:46,520
engines were built back in 1870.
That could run using alcohol or

2897
02:09:46,521 --> 02:09:48,890
gasoline.
A New York Times article from 19.

2898
02:09:48,891 --> 02:09:52,100
Oh,
eight enthusiastically states auto is

2899
02:09:52,101 --> 02:09:56,090
discussed alcohol as fuel.
Great future ahead for use in commercial

2900
02:09:56,091 --> 02:09:58,340
wagons.
Has Professor Lock,

2901
02:09:58,380 --> 02:09:59,400
lock,
lock.

2902
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,100
What does it say that look,
look,

2903
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:07,100
I'm tests with motor truck.
Er Hewitt

2904
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:11,810
tells engineers of his results with
gasoline and alcohol and the same

2905
02:10:11,811 --> 02:10:13,670
engine.
Henry Ford said that alcohol was a

2906
02:10:13,671 --> 02:10:14,421
cleaner,
nicer,

2907
02:10:14,421 --> 02:10:16,730
better fuel for automobiles than
gasoline.

2908
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:18,110
Wow.
Holy Shit.

2909
02:10:19,310 --> 02:10:20,180
Wow.
This is nuts,

2910
02:10:20,181 --> 02:10:20,790
man.

2911
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:21,660
Yeah,
it's the same thing.

2912
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:25,080
It's.
It's a fucking banana propaganda.

2913
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:26,760
Alcohol propaganda.

2914
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:31,060
That is so crazy because you can make
alcohol without fossil fuels.

2915
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:34,220
So if you made alcohol today,
you could fuel

2916
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:36,020
mean.
People can make alcohol,

2917
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:39,470
right?
People make apple apparently anything,

2918
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:42,410
any vegetable that ferments you can use
as fuel.

2919
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:44,030
It's really simple.
Anything.

2920
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:46,070
Do you know Neil Young has that?
Well,

2921
02:10:46,071 --> 02:10:48,340
he has diesel though.
He doesn't make alcohol fueled,

2922
02:10:48,341 --> 02:10:49,400
but he makes diesel.
He makes.

2923
02:10:49,410 --> 02:10:53,090
Biodiesel is a giant ranch.
I think it's northern California at the

2924
02:10:53,091 --> 02:10:54,560
same thing.
If it ferments,

2925
02:10:54,590 --> 02:10:58,760
it's maybe you call it diesel,
but it's fermented vegetable matter.

2926
02:10:58,850 --> 02:11:00,110
I don't know.
I'm just guessing.

2927
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:01,900
I don't know,
but that's what Henry Ford said.

2928
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:04,550
Henry Ford said anything that you could
ferment apples,

2929
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:07,370
anything.
You could turn it into biofuel.

2930
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:09,350
That's crazy.
John D Dot Rockefeller.

2931
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:11,690
That's what he was all about.
He's the richest man in the world,

2932
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:15,360
was raised by a psychopath,
and he did.

2933
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:18,590
He got busted for monopolizing or are
they finally indicted him?

2934
02:11:18,591 --> 02:11:21,170
He had a break out,
a break apart standard oil,

2935
02:11:21,171 --> 02:11:22,370
and it made him a billionaire.

2936
02:11:22,430 --> 02:11:24,140
That's what made him rich is when he got
busted.

2937
02:11:24,290 --> 02:11:26,360
When he got to sell everything off,
he just.

2938
02:11:26,590 --> 02:11:31,590
He took over education do.
When you learn how to a documentary,

2939
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:34,880
what is it?
How big oil conquer the world on

2940
02:11:34,881 --> 02:11:36,240
Youtube?
I'm scared.

2941
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:37,950
Scared you,
you.

2942
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:40,790
You actually learn what it all comes
from a hundred percent,

2943
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:42,380
hundred percent.
One hundred percent.

2944
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:44,600
It's psycho.
Yeah.

2945
02:11:44,690 --> 02:11:46,820
Yeah.
One dude with his sons,

2946
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:49,130
his sons and his grandson and kind of
makes sense,

2947
02:11:49,131 --> 02:11:49,701
right?
I mean,

2948
02:11:49,701 --> 02:11:54,320
if you think about it,
I mean the really super ambitious people

2949
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:58,430
in business are a lot of times.
The most cutthroat than most.

2950
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:02,360
You mean how competitive you got to be
to be like a William Randolph hearst or

2951
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:03,960
one of these motherfuckers?
You know,

2952
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:07,640
it took over a universities did.
He wanted to take over the world.

2953
02:12:07,641 --> 02:12:09,680
He wasn't just trying to sell gas.
He's trying to take over the world.

2954
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:13,670
Our education system is all based on
Rockefeller Foundation.

2955
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:17,900
Shit,
like key strategically wanted to make

2956
02:12:17,901 --> 02:12:20,990
school so that we got people just smart
enough.

2957
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:24,650
Just this conspiracy to.
They're just smart enough to work.

2958
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:28,370
They didn't want anybody to smart.
That's how the school system is designed

2959
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:31,700
to be safe.
It's watched the documentary and then

2960
02:12:31,701 --> 02:12:32,920
you come to.
You've seen in Jamie,

2961
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:36,590
now you just opened up,
this is how we did it.

2962
02:12:36,770 --> 02:12:38,750
This is how he did it.
He would just donate.

2963
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:41,900
He said he'd go to a university like the
University of Chicago and just how I'm

2964
02:12:41,901 --> 02:12:43,760
going to give you millions of dollars.
And they said,

2965
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:45,080
Oh shit.
He goes,

2966
02:12:45,081 --> 02:12:47,970
but I got to have a couple of my people
on your board dementia.

2967
02:12:47,971 --> 02:12:48,531
It spent.
Right?

2968
02:12:48,531 --> 02:12:49,364
And they're like,
okay.

2969
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:52,670
So he gets his people in and then they
just take over and they designed,

2970
02:12:52,730 --> 02:12:57,680
they designed history.
John d Dot Rockefeller got 2020

2971
02:12:57,681 --> 02:13:00,140
historians and designed the history.

2972
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:01,880
They designed it.
That's why when people,

2973
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:04,400
you know,
you make fun of history in ninth grade

2974
02:13:04,401 --> 02:13:05,700
books,
you make fun of that history.

2975
02:13:05,701 --> 02:13:06,534
It's a joke,
right?

2976
02:13:06,990 --> 02:13:11,990
It was put together by the,
by a Rockefeller to look at that number

2977
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:17,260
is peak wealth was 318 point
$3,000,000,000 based on the 2007 US

2978
02:13:19,311 --> 02:13:21,410
dollar.
Oh my God.

2979
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:24,620
He lived to 98.
He was a motherfucker bro.

2980
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:27,800
Look at his dad lived to be 98 years
old.

2981
02:13:27,890 --> 02:13:29,900
Oh my God.
His Dad,

2982
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:33,660
big bill rocket was the devil bill.
They called them a lot of things,

2983
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:37,470
but definitely this man who spent most
of his times thinking of schemes to

2984
02:13:37,471 --> 02:13:39,270
avoid actual work.
Nevertheless,

2985
02:13:39,271 --> 02:13:40,550
thanks to the guidelines,
I was swallow.

2986
02:13:40,551 --> 02:13:42,780
My lies.
A homemaker and devout baptist.

2987
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:45,190
John d grew up to be quite a hard work

2988
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:46,500
man.
Okay,

2989
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:49,860
interesting man.

2990
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,530
Interesting Shit.
Check that out.

2991
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:53,940
What's called big oil wet.
What is it?

2992
02:13:53,970 --> 02:13:57,600
How big oil conquered the world.
That's if you're a conspiracy theorist,

2993
02:13:57,750 --> 02:14:00,240
you know,
most people don't go beyond a jfk.

2994
02:14:00,241 --> 02:14:02,830
There's so much in just jfk and then all
the,

2995
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:05,040
you know,
if you want to enter the water gate in

2996
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:07,950
the Iran Contra and all of the nine
slash 11,

2997
02:14:07,951 --> 02:14:11,370
there's so much information that's,
it's so hard to get into multiple

2998
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:13,230
things.
But once you,

2999
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:16,710
once you got that covered,
go back and find out how it all started

3000
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:19,220
and you learned when you go,
when you find out that,

3001
02:14:19,610 --> 02:14:21,690
that uh,
George Senior's dad,

3002
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:25,450
Prescott Bush started the CIA and then
you'd go back and his dad,

3003
02:14:25,451 --> 02:14:27,800
Samuel Bush was,
was uh,

3004
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:31,350
uh,
Frank Rockefeller's right hand man and

3005
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:35,700
how the bushes and the rockefellers have
have always ran shit.

3006
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:37,650
When you go back,
Samuel Bush,

3007
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:40,560
George senior,
think about how old he is.

3008
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:44,760
His grandfather ran with Rockefeller.
You have to do a podcast.

3009
02:14:44,761 --> 02:14:48,150
You and Michael Shermer.
Who's that guy who just left?

3010
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,310
Oh Man,
I still wanted to.

3011
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:52,630
He didn't want to talk.
I just want to talk from the moment he

3012
02:14:52,631 --> 02:14:54,750
walked in.
You think tower seven went down on its

3013
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:57,870
own.
The moment you don't ignore tower seven,

3014
02:14:58,050 --> 02:15:01,050
people say,
I don't want to wrap up.

3015
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:02,760
I do have to end you.
GotTa.

3016
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:04,110
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm so sorry.

3017
02:15:04,490 --> 02:15:07,470
I would love to talk about it's way
late.

3018
02:15:07,490 --> 02:15:08,550
Okay.
I gotta get Outta here.

3019
02:15:08,610 --> 02:15:10,830
Alright.
But we sort of broke down the UFC.

3020
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:12,780
We did for awhile.
We totally did.

3021
02:15:12,781 --> 02:15:15,780
Conor and nate are both fucking legends
right now.

3022
02:15:15,781 --> 02:15:17,270
Both of them.
Holly Holm,

3023
02:15:17,271 --> 02:15:19,110
Misha Tate,
both legends right now.

3024
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:21,390
We're gonna.
Look back at this 20 years from now and

3025
02:15:21,391 --> 02:15:24,840
have an old man narrate the highlights
and it's going to be fucking saying,

3026
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:26,940
sitting in a wheelchair thinking about
this shit.

3027
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,890
Yeah,
it was classic classic shit.

3028
02:15:28,891 --> 02:15:32,040
I think it was the greatest two fights
ever in UFC history.

3029
02:15:32,090 --> 02:15:34,960
I think that was the greatest ufc ever.
That was the greatest ufc ever know.

3030
02:15:35,250 --> 02:15:36,090
You know,
people keep saying,

3031
02:15:36,091 --> 02:15:36,670
oh,
cheap,

3032
02:15:36,670 --> 02:15:38,220
screwed,
greatest over because they keep getting

3033
02:15:38,221 --> 02:15:38,940
better.
This,

3034
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:41,610
that was.
Those were the two highlights to me that

3035
02:15:41,611 --> 02:15:43,880
made me.
I mean it was bananas.

3036
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:46,170
Chaos.
Even in Connor's defeat.

3037
02:15:46,171 --> 02:15:51,171
He looked like a fucking,
just like that global barberry and he

3038
02:15:51,451 --> 02:15:54,570
handled the last leg a champ right after
the loss.

3039
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:55,770
Yeah,
right after loss.

3040
02:15:55,771 --> 02:15:57,280
He handled it like a champ.
Alright,

3041
02:15:57,320 --> 02:16:01,410
you Fox will be back tomorrow.
Tomorrow's Chris Bell,

3042
02:16:01,411 --> 02:16:03,690
right from a prescription.
Thugs.

3043
02:16:04,590 --> 02:16:06,360
You ever want to see that?
I heard about that.

3044
02:16:06,361 --> 02:16:07,770
I want to see them.
I'm watching it tonight.

3045
02:16:08,170 --> 02:16:09,870
That's all Rockefeller to.
That's all.

3046
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:10,441
Thank you.
Bye.

3047
02:16:10,441 --> 02:16:11,250
Bye.
Big Kiss.
