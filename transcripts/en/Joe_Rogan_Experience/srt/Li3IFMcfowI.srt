1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,200
You were on Fox News.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:03,430
Yeah.

4
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,210
It was once upon a time.

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,841
Made it in there.

6
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:08,420
Did it smell like sulfur smell like souls?

7
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,750
Why are the girls that
work there so fucking hot?

8
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,250
Cause I know how to hire people.

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,691
This insane.

10
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:15,530
They're way too hot.

11
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:19,820
It's not fair because men will agree
with them just to hope that they will say

12
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,310
Yan high five you'll change
your whole philosophy.

13
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,090
And there's,

14
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,820
you can find clips on youtube where
people have just put together every time

15
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:28,700
they like open their legs
during the various segments.

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,040
Praise the Lord.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,910
They're too hot.

18
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,743
It's unfair.

19
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,950
That's like hypnosis.

20
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,150
You know some of those.

21
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:36,230
What was that woman's Nagin?

22
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:36,621
What's her name?

23
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:37,560
The really angry wagon.

24
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:37,900
Kelly.

25
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,800
She's so fucking hot.

26
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,663
It's ridiculous.

27
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,300
Where she showed me some Meghan Kelly.

28
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,230
This is,

29
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:42,990
oh this is,

30
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,823
this is really cool.

31
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,490
Play this because this is
how I found out about Lee,

32
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,330
but back it up.

33
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,970
So I'm sure you guys are gonna have
a lot more jokes for the rest of the

34
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:50,804
campaign here.

35
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,860
They just keep going.

36
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,641
And can I,

37
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,720
can I just ask a question?

38
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,500
Sure.

39
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:54,731
What?

40
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:56,210
What is Fox News?

41
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:58,160
It's just a parade of propaganda and it,

42
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:00,860
it's just that it's just
a festival of ignorance.

43
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,740
What people are dead and Iraq.

44
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,370
Come on.

45
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,270
This is ridiculous.

46
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:06,230
What's the point of this?

47
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,220
Wow.

48
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,070
This is insane.

49
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,210
Go outside and go,

50
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,520
well,

51
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,353
fuck.

52
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,503
Love your face.

53
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:15,801
Really.

54
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:16,250
You know?

55
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,640
Can you get all the news,

56
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,261
all the news?

57
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:20,094
You can.

58
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:20,861
All right.

59
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:21,141
Thanks.

60
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:22,270
As the best watch.

61
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:24,220
This is the best part.

62
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,600
We're also texting out captain Kirk this
morning because it's Saturday morning.

63
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,381
Some fun.

64
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:29,770
Greg,

65
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,990
you got the cushiest job in the world.

66
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,331
Yeah.

67
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:32,601
Look who?

68
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:33,381
Just a beam.

69
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:34,191
The board right now,

70
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,990
the ladies from the Star Ship Enterprise.

71
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,710
Hello,

72
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,543
welcome

73
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,460
call.

74
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,180
I just wrote a new book on Captain Kirk
and the way he was able to woo beautiful

75
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:45,014
women like this.

76
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,360
It's all coming up to the table.

77
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,390
Talk about Captain Cook,

78
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,224
getting laid,

79
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,270
but come on the fictional
character captain car too,

80
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:51,800
by the way.

81
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,680
Not even William Shatner.

82
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:52,980
Yeah,

83
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,170
no,

84
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,590
no.

85
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,600
All Book I was in the green room with.

86
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:58,040
Then I could not figure out why
there were these women there.

87
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,920
I had no idea that you just,

88
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,790
it was almost like it was scripted because
you said that and they showed you was

89
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,160
the most inane stupid piece of shit.

90
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,810
I didn't even know that
was coming up next.

91
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,351
Oh my God.

92
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:10,161
It was perfect.

93
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:10,880
You couldn't have been,

94
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,190
what if they went to some
series news and fuck you.

95
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,600
You know he wanted to,

96
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,610
you could see in his face
as he read the teleprompter.

97
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:17,031
He was like,

98
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:17,331
all right,

99
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,400
we're going to get out of this and go,

100
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,820
ah shit.

101
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,723
Indeed.

102
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,270
It's like completely proved your point.

103
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,980
Like right away,

104
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:25,190
like,

105
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,023
come on man.

106
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,500
How did Kirk get laid?

107
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,560
He gets give written.

108
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,081
They wrote did.

109
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:29,691
He got laid.

110
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,950
The writers made them get laid.

111
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,880
He's not a real guy.

112
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,300
Jesus fucking Christ aliens.

113
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,820
There's two wars going on.

114
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,740
The fucking tire banking system had to
be bailed out by taxpayer's money and

115
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,190
they just wanted to see
what a human cock was like.

116
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,150
That's how he got laid.

117
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,420
Do you think they have like a bunch of
shit that they will throw out there like

118
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:51,480
beach balls to distract and they get
like they get it from the CIA every week.

119
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,980
[inaudible] Star Trek check.

120
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,370
They just have to send it like this.

121
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,760
The way we want you to
talk about this week,

122
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,100
like really just to Zap the American mind.

123
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,950
Yeah.

124
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,230
No,

125
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,370
no,

126
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:00,550
no,

127
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,900
no,

128
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,100
no,

129
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,670
no,

130
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,503
no.

131
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,791
You know what I mean?

132
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,110
I don't believe that it is.

133
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,650
I don't believe,

134
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,390
I think I tend to think that it's more
in competence than Dan and his conspiracy

135
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,560
ratings.

136
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,970
They don't actually care about the news.

137
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:14,110
They only care about ratings.

138
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,040
They don't care about the news,

139
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,630
but I think in general,

140
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:21,631
like even the most of what we think of
as being this big gigantic conspiracy

141
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:26,941
with our government and the media is more
in competence and Horesh behavior than

142
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:28,780
anything just to prostitutes.

143
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,780
They prostituted themselves out because
that's the way they got the good

144
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,351
assignments.

145
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,220
They got to the good places.

146
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,300
They've got the big ratings.

147
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:34,991
I mean,

148
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,190
you don't get to that point.

149
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,850
You don't get to that job unless you've
proved yourself a faithful foot soldier

150
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,310
to whatever their messages generally,

151
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,203
you know they're not,

152
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,590
you're not going to get hired on there.

153
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,310
Yeah.

154
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,680
And even guys that used
to be kind of like rebels,

155
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,000
like Geraldo Rivera for other Rivera
was kind of a rebel at one point.

156
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:52,750
Dad,

157
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,141
you know,

158
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:56,920
he was the guy that had Dick Gregory on
TV and showed the Zapruder film for the

159
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,754
first time.

160
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,520
I had a fistfight at a KKK rally,

161
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,500
I think on a shelf.

162
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,890
Someone hit him in the head with a chair.

163
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,990
They might not even
been trying to hit him.

164
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:08,320
It was just a melee and I think a chairman
flying and he got his nose broken and

165
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:08,831
he was fucked up.

166
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,910
But that he was so excited,

167
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:10,851
so excited,

168
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,190
yet an actual cut on his face.

169
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,300
I'm a tough guy.

170
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:13,800
Like,

171
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,110
what's that?

172
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,530
He was supposed to box frank Stallone
or something crazy like that too.

173
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,030
How long time ago?

174
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm like,

175
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,511
God,

176
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:20,560
they might have actually done it.

177
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,783
I don't know.

178
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,541
I'm pretty sure,

179
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,680
but he's a wild dude,

180
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,300
or at least he was a wild dude.

181
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,051
You know,

182
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,570
and now he's just like Fox News puppet.

183
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:32,140
It's weird when you see the ones
that actually stick to their guns.

184
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,370
They don't last long.

185
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,850
I mean Cenk Yoga lasted two
months at Msnbc before he went,

186
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:37,690
before he needed to leave.

187
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,530
Amber Lyon is another one that left
because her Bahrain story actually he

188
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,364
mentioned by rain,

189
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,760
uh,

190
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,570
CNN,

191
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,710
she brought it back to them and said,

192
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:45,790
this is what's going on about rain.

193
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,300
But they were doing ads talking about
how great Bahrain was and they wouldn't

194
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:50,080
play her segment.

195
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,530
Yeah,

196
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:50,741
yeah.

197
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,040
She,

198
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,570
she's been on the podcast before and
she explained it all to us and it's,

199
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:58,571
it's so hard to believe that what we
consider to be like shining revered

200
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,100
institution of news,

201
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,934
like CNN,

202
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,760
it was just a bullshit
propaganda wing that they,

203
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,410
that they're capable of
that kind of behavior.

204
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,490
If she's telling the truth.

205
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,270
I don't know.

206
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,103
I wasn't there.

207
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,010
I assume she is.

208
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,000
She seems very honest.

209
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,190
I don't know anybody else's
side on the other side.

210
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:12,781
I don't know.

211
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:14,410
I don't know what the
fuck is really going on.

212
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,410
So I probably shouldn't comment
on what CNN did or didn't do,

213
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:20,750
but I know for a fact
they're not reporting a lot
of shit that's going on and

214
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:21,730
now we're putting a lot of shit.

215
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,170
And I feel like all of these networks,

216
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:24,100
that mainstream media,

217
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,390
it's a very small box of accepted
thought that is allowed on them.

218
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,130
It's not,

219
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,710
it's not,

220
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,660
they're not going to go either fairly
far to aid to either side or outside that

221
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,380
box.

222
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,070
No,

223
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,210
it's not really the news.

224
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,840
And that's one of the more interesting
things about the internet is because of

225
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:44,320
the Internet now there's all these
sources that are like more real news.

226
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:47,080
Like they're telling you about shit
that's going on that you might not have

227
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,914
known.

228
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,570
So we get Anal Fox News girls,

229
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,840
why they're so hot it,

230
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,780
those girls are so God damn hot.

231
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,220
Like I don't want to marry them.

232
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,630
I don't want to have
relationships with them.

233
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,100
But if I was a single man,

234
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,420
I would be very attracted
to those angry bitches

235
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,510
or the weathermen in La.

236
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,321
I just think there's,

237
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:03,920
so,

238
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,720
there's so like aggressive,

239
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,460
I dunno if they're so strong,

240
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,670
like there's so stern in their opinion.

241
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:09,921
Yeah.

242
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,090
Most of them are not dumb.

243
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,160
There's nothing to do with dumb.

244
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,820
No.

245
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,270
It says about those mean bitches.

246
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,313
Yeah.

247
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,330
Just because I'm a glutton for punishment.

248
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,530
But if you,

249
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:19,250
um,

250
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,330
like when you're on that show,

251
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:20,651
like what,

252
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:20,871
what,

253
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,370
what does it like when
you were in that studio,

254
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:23,181
does it feel weird?

255
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,000
Do you feel like,

256
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,511
well that's the thing.

257
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,490
It's like all of them just seem
like they're doing their job.

258
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:26,731
I mean,

259
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:26,881
yeah,

260
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:27,960
they went for the evil empire,

261
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:28,710
but they don't,

262
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,330
they're just like whatever
gets them through the day.

263
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:31,860
Oh I need to say this
thing and this thing.

264
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,480
And then where we know
we wrap for the day.

265
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:33,990
Like,

266
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,780
so I had to remind myself why it
was important for me to do that.

267
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:37,191
I like read,

268
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:39,390
read an article about how a
million people died in Iraq.

269
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,200
I mean this was,

270
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,150
this was several years back and uh,

271
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,223
and you know,

272
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,700
cause you don't want to fuck up the show.

273
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,510
Like I felt like I needed to do it and
I only want it to be on there once.

274
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:48,961
I was like,

275
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:49,950
if they're having me on,

276
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,210
it's going to be a one time thing.

277
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,253
This is yet

278
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,531
dude.

279
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,690
It was if you were like a publicity
whore and I know you're not,

280
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:55,830
but that be an awesome move.

281
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,680
I mean it worked out

282
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,010
great.

283
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,590
I never thought it was
7:00 AM on a Saturday.

284
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,240
I truly thought the only people,

285
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:02,620
and this is four or five years ago,

286
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:02,981
we're not,

287
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,720
everything on the news went online.

288
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,170
Right.

289
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,830
I truly thought the only people seeing
it would fox news fans at 7:00 AM on a

290
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:12,250
Saturday and instead it went up
online and viral and all that shit.

291
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:12,480
Man,

292
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,430
if you got something
relevant to say the Internet,

293
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,060
we'll catch it.

294
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,420
Yeah,

295
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,110
they'll find it and they'll put it
out there to go back to that girl like

296
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:19,670
standing,

297
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,910
sitting there with her legs open.

298
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,150
This is insane.

299
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,300
I just want to point something out of how
we are so weird like as a culture that

300
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,790
this is a part of like
normal everyday office life.

301
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,151
Like,

302
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,470
we've got to make some decisions here.

303
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,040
Like,

304
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,430
okay,

305
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,263
look at this woman.

306
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,150
She's showing everything but her vagina.

307
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,900
I mean her knee is just
strategically blocking her.

308
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:43,734
Lavia.

309
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,710
Her legs are wide open
and she's hot as fuck.

310
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:46,981
Now,

311
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:47,371
here's the thing.

312
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:50,700
If you put the Kyron right
in front of the vagina,

313
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,230
then everybody would know the news.

314
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,213
Exactly.

315
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,230
We'd be a very informed country

316
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,340
and women would get angry
at you if you knew the news.

317
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:57,640
Oh,

318
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,920
you were looking at her vagina
and you read the fucking news.

319
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:00,754
Huh?

320
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,750
Like she like,

321
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,820
it's just weird that they
get to dress like that.

322
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,280
Like she's completely
wearing come fuck me.

323
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:07,900
Pumps could back that up again.

324
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:08,111
Let's,

325
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:09,400
let's dissect this.

326
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,170
Look at her like her shoes.

327
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,100
Those are like,

328
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,900
I want to go out and get sexy shoes.

329
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,840
There's a not comfortable by
any stretch of the imagination.

330
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,400
They show most of your foot.

331
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:18,730
You,

332
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:18,940
her,

333
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,010
almost her entire legs are exposed.

334
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,730
Me.

335
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,320
Imagine if a guy was
sitting there like that.

336
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,800
Do you know how bizarre that would be
if there was a show where a guy was

337
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,150
sitting there in a tiny,

338
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:33,151
tiny kilt and you know that you could
bear if he moves his left knee an inch to

339
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:33,701
the right,

340
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:35,500
you're going to see his cock for sure.

341
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,870
And they also have like an ejection
button that slings them into the

342
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:43,660
stratosphere once they
hit 35 hit an age limit.

343
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,770
Aw,

344
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,603
poor girls.

345
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,360
That's sad.

346
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,050
It's actually has some kind
of irritation down there.

347
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:48,290
So,

348
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,290
well I think Sarah Pailin brought
the dumb milf back so maybe uh,

349
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,220
maybe will move in that direction,

350
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,030
but I don't think she
actually brought it back.

351
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:57,990
She brought it back for a little bit.

352
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,040
But now Pete pro like cotton,

353
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,290
you say too much crazy shit.

354
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,373
Guelph,

355
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:01,790
Guelph,

356
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,090
if we're getting the grandma right,

357
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:03,301
right.

358
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,134
She's guilt.

359
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,790
You don't want to say that though.

360
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,451
Cause that'll fuck with you.

361
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:06,691
Dig.

362
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,524
It's creepy.

363
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:07,801
Yeah.

364
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:08,700
MILF is okay,

365
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:10,920
but Guelph not so much.

366
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,150
It's just weird that we
have these odd standards of,

367
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,510
of sexual attire in the workplace
and not just in the workplace,

368
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:19,530
but on television,

369
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,640
like on television.

370
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:25,641
Promoting this to strange propaganda
machine and just really hot girls with

371
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,790
their vaginas,

372
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,280
hanging out explosions and hot girls.

373
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,641
Okay,

374
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:30,510
I can't pay attention.

375
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,291
Whatever the fuck.

376
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,124
She said,

377
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:32,701
well,

378
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,534
she's here.

379
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,410
Oh my God.

380
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,880
See if I see that girl.

381
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:36,211
I go,

382
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:36,631
wow,

383
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:37,500
I wish she liked me.

384
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:39,811
You know?

385
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:43,860
Especially if you're lonely and you
know you're not married or anything.

386
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,070
Did that like 12 times her size?

387
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,311
Yeah,

388
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,630
it's rob Ford's fat brother.

389
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,850
And what other shows have like Kimbera
man that from the ground that isn't,

390
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,240
no,

391
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,270
it's totally an upstairs.

392
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,280
They're panning from the vagina up.

393
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,620
It's off center just slightly.

394
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,360
He's trying to show off his two though.

395
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,290
You gotta give him credit.

396
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:01,741
He's,

397
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:01,981
well,

398
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:02,220
you know,

399
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,120
he's got to go to war.

400
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,421
You know,

401
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,410
you gotta get her respect.

402
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,740
He doesn't give a fuck look like the only
way I'm gonna get this one is if I let

403
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,870
her know I don't give
a fuck because my gut,

404
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,460
I'm not trying to cover myself up.

405
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,750
I'm staying an extra straight.

406
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,620
I'm spreading my legs.

407
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,250
Why?

408
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,000
Look at that package.

409
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,260
He's going for the don't give a fuck.

410
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,340
He's like,

411
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,551
I'm,

412
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:18,510
I might be a fat fuck,

413
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:19,590
but I'll fuck the shit outta you.

414
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:20,424
Dirty Bitch.

415
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm fat because I like
to live the good life.

416
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,573
That's what he's saying.

417
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,810
Like others play lists,

418
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,370
all the different ones.

419
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,960
Was that one the one that you just showed?

420
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,371
That's a Fox.

421
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,240
Went to the redhead.

422
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:30,871
Yeah,

423
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:31,351
it's great.

424
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:31,670
That one,

425
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,030
the blonde that was on the screen.

426
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,260
I know who she is.

427
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:34,800
That's the one.

428
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,720
She's been on these things before.

429
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,650
They're all hot though.

430
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,640
They're beautiful.

431
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,473
It's weird,

432
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,460
but it's just such dirty trick.

433
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,260
I'm not,

434
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,260
especially like if you're married
and you know when you're trying to be

435
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,434
monogamous,

436
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,450
you're going to look at sex in a different
way because you look at like a girl

437
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,111
that's like super,

438
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,280
super hot and you go,

439
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,360
oh,

440
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,590
I could never get that.

441
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,540
If you're single,

442
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,770
if you're delusional,

443
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:02,311
you'd be like,

444
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:02,581
man,

445
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:05,160
if I just ran into her
at the right place time,

446
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,173
maybe this could happen.

447
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,260
So it's a different thing.

448
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,070
So it's the,

449
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,940
there's a wistful,

450
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,900
almost romantic way.

451
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,100
You look at the Fox News girls,

452
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,200
if you're married on the same note,

453
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:13,800
it's like when a,

454
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,101
when a,

455
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:16,380
when a hot celebrity like gets divorced,

456
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,900
there's something inside
the most loser of guys.

457
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:20,010
It's like now I got a shot,

458
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,160
like Angelina Jolie gets to
a voice and people are like,

459
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:23,700
okay,

460
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,080
they think all I gotta do,

461
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,710
he there,

462
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,590
I'm just there guys are
so fucking delusional.

463
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,950
They feel like all they gotta do is
be at the right place the right time.

464
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:32,131
You know,

465
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:35,940
maybe she goes to the car shop cause her
wipers broken and she wants to try to

466
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:36,661
fix it herself.

467
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:37,500
And you know,

468
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,610
I get to impress her by my knowledge of
windshield wipers and she realized I'm

469
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,410
just a regular guy and sometimes girls,

470
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,393
Jesus Christ,

471
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,400
she actually pulls her skirt up.

472
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,310
Look Bam.

473
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,580
Like,

474
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,413
oh,

475
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,940
how dare you,

476
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:51,840
you dirty bitch.

477
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,890
Oh my God.

478
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,340
Past she sits right.

479
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,503
Ah,

480
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,130
it just seems like a perfect posture.

481
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,780
It's kind of like going back to when you
were like really young looking at like,

482
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,840
like JC Penny's lingerie catalogs and
you wonder why people that Watch Fox News

483
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:06,870
are idiots.

484
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,410
I mean,

485
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,820
not that a lot of network time,

486
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:09,451
but you know,

487
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:11,340
they did that study that
people that watch Fox News,

488
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:12,540
no less about what's
happening in the world.

489
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,860
The people are watching no news at all.

490
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,610
I believe that.

491
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,141
I love that.

492
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:15,200
Yeah.

493
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,033
Does that make sense?

494
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:16,951
It'd be no,

495
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:18,980
you gonna you gonna find out
about Captain Kirk's love life.

496
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,250
So these are two regular guys.

497
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,870
ABC.

498
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,310
Look how,

499
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,510
let me see as regular gals,

500
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,810
ABC is more probably geared towards
women that don't want to be threatened

501
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,650
drunk doing the background.

502
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,340
He's never seen this video
and know there's the naked no,

503
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,350
it's just hammered.

504
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,313
Any shorts.

505
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,991
Well Christy,

506
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,400
they are the whole
neighborhood knows the boy.

507
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,234
They

508
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,210
fucking second story window
and fell in the bath.

509
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,290
That's amazing.

510
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,551
Oh my God.

511
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:47,384
That's funny.

512
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,830
That's funny.

513
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,071
Yeah.

514
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:50,780
If you leave the fucking
camera on long enough,

515
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,460
people catch the craziest shit ever.

516
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,280
Did you see any of the
like the snow storm,

517
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,870
uh,

518
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,370
driving footage son you got jacked?

519
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,790
Yes.

520
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,623
Yeah.

521
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,160
Yeah.

522
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,310
It was a snow storms all throughout the,

523
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:03,361
uh,

524
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:03,951
the country.

525
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,230
They've been getting these
nutty snow and ice storms.

526
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,560
Okay.

527
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,310
Yeah.

528
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,143
What is that man?

529
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:09,540
It's,

530
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,340
it should be not,

531
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,220
it's unfair.

532
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:11,461
I mean,

533
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:13,560
I don't want to say that pretty
girl shouldn't be able to get a job.

534
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,670
They certainly should,

535
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,450
but it shouldn't be exclusively pretty
girls telling you about important shit.

536
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,890
We of course were too week.

537
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,210
We're not paying attention to the message.

538
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:21,610
No,

539
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,443
not at all.

540
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,261
But that's thing.

541
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,940
Have you seen an ugly girl on the news?

542
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:25,481
You're like,

543
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:25,811
Dad,

544
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:26,770
girl knows his shit.

545
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,221
Right?

546
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:28,750
She fought her way to the top.

547
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,390
There's something about,

548
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,290
um,

549
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:31,531
like,

550
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:31,710
uh,

551
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,431
like what I said,

552
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:35,730
like those Fox News women that like the
one you were talking about before the

553
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,360
show started,

554
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,450
who argued with someone about
Santa Claus being white.

555
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,860
Megan Kelly apparently as it said very
authoritatively that Santa Claus is

556
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:44,430
white.

557
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:44,800
Yeah,

558
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,930
she's very authoritative.

559
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:46,764
Always.

560
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,180
A lot of those gals are.

561
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,730
But there's something like four Beta men,

562
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,910
especially for men that are
weak and beaten down by life.

563
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,980
The ultimate fantasy is that this woman
accepts you the ultimate fantasies that

564
00:13:58,981 --> 00:13:59,761
she's impressed by you.

565
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:01,320
An exception cause she's so hard ass.

566
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,880
She's so obviously beautiful,

567
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:05,100
but also so hard ass that there's this,

568
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,181
there's this,

569
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:06,720
uh,

570
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,081
you know,

571
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:07,861
when she's around you,

572
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:09,840
you want to like mock Obamacare.

573
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,320
You want to just start making fun of it.

574
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,560
It like he'll write specific job roles.

575
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,060
Yeah.

576
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,300
Just to get in and has to
get in and just talk to her.

577
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,571
Yeah.

578
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:19,440
San Is White.

579
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,450
You're God damn right.

580
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:21,940
He is white VRC.

581
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,790
Show me one picture with Santa with black.

582
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,260
It wasn't drawn by a black guy.

583
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:35,770
Yeah.
