1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,601
Trey,

2
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:03,750
my daddy Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,453
Let's go to the uh,

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,181
Amanda Nunez.

5
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:07,020
Ronda Rousey fight.

6
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,000
If you got to put some money down,

7
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,380
what do you,

8
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,030
what do you think man?

9
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:13,290
Who the fuck knows?

10
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,480
I love saying who the
fuck knows because you,

11
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,020
we haven't seen Ronda
fight in over a year.

12
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,210
We don't own the heads
are looking at her body.

13
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,650
She's in insane shape.

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,110
This a pictures of her online throwing
punches and you look at her back,

15
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,540
you're like,

16
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,110
oh leash and seeing them,

17
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,093
she's down.

18
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,210
She's down to fight.

19
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:30,720
Wake.

20
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,870
Wait already apparently you know,

21
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,730
I think losing to someone like Holly
Holm the way she did and to be tired and

22
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:41,370
get beat up and the whole deal
like look at her back there,

23
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,450
which is punching the speed bag.

24
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,313
Jesus.

25
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,210
That's where a donkey.

26
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,163
God Damn.

27
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,680
So if you think about the way she lost
that fight and how she looked physically,

28
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,460
she didn't look nothing like this.

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,540
Like not even close.

30
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,780
Like she's got all these videos of her
running up hills and all this different

31
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,440
stuff.

32
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,640
She looks like way more fit because she
got tired in the fight with Holly and

33
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:03,600
that was a big factor.

34
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:05,820
It's also getting hit was a big factor.

35
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,710
Getting stunned right away and,

36
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:11,850
but really solid conditioning will allow
you to recover better than not being in

37
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,570
such good shape.

38
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,860
Especially when you get hit in the Ed.

39
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,710
That's a a big factor with
the guys that are super,

40
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,900
super fit is how they bounce back.

41
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:19,741
You know,

42
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,550
like um,

43
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,780
Neil,

44
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,780
Maggie's a good example.

45
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,400
You can stun that guy in the first round,

46
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,240
but he's so fit.

47
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,010
He bounces back for her to that,

48
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:26,760
that Holly fight.

49
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,330
You should,

50
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,390
the one thing that Ron,

51
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,370
she always comes to fight,

52
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,270
she's always in shape.

53
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,320
She takes that,

54
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,740
you know,

55
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,221
personal,

56
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:37,110
it takes it upon herself to Sean have
the same sort of dedication towards that

57
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:39,030
fight with Holly that she's
got towards this fight.

58
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,910
Physically it doesn't let us think.

59
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,600
We know physically you can say that,

60
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,160
but we don't know cause
she'd been shooting movies.

61
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:45,080
She won't do press count.

62
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,270
Right.

63
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,751
You know what I'm saying?

64
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:46,350
So we don't know.

65
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,590
She could take her down her
judo and not try to strike with,

66
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:50,760
they're just clinch up.

67
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,710
Do that judo trip.

68
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,573
Take her down.

69
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,220
Anybody's in danger of that arm bar.

70
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,470
That's what she's got.

71
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,500
That's where she's going to Mandan and
this could easily get caught in that arm

72
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:00,651
bar.

73
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:01,170
Wouldn't shock.

74
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,130
Here's a question for age.

75
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:02,964
Just got to drag her.

76
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,671
Here's a question.

77
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:04,141
Where did you guys,

78
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:09,141
do you think she has the coaching to
make changes where she just doesn't pull

79
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,840
forward on Amanda Nunez and
get punched in the face?

80
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,920
She's going to become,

81
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,460
of course she's going to take her time.

82
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,440
Of course she's not going
to go out there reckless.

83
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,820
She's gonna take her time.

84
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,680
That's how she came round
around Shit anyways,

85
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,330
and it seems like common sense.

86
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,530
Don't fucking get crazy.

87
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:24,600
Get in there and just
fucking get the blood going.

88
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,320
That's not her.

89
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,153
That's not her head.

90
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,260
She didn't get to man Mike Tyson,

91
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:29,940
gay sound outside and Jab and do.

92
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,310
She might try to overwhelm arm,

93
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,220
but she's not stupid.

94
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,540
She's going to learn from mistakes.

95
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,970
They just fight a cleaner fight,

96
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:36,751
more movement,

97
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:37,710
more head movement.

98
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,130
The surgery.

99
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,560
She's had knee surgery since then.

100
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,940
She could take Amanda down.

101
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,730
I think she can take cat cat,

102
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,403
cat,

103
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,370
cat Zingano had a real hard first round
and the first round in man and Nunez is

104
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,930
beating the shit out of her cat Nunez.

105
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,830
Art Cat Nunez.

106
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Cat Cat came back and stopped new
needs that's got her on the back.

107
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,850
Let her down for a cardio.

108
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,580
If Rhonda,

109
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,101
again,

110
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,190
it's tough because what makes
Rhonda great is there's this flurry,

111
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,120
there's exchange.

112
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,910
Next thing you know you're f she
fucking hip toss you in your non bar.

113
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:10,071
Right.

114
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:10,780
And that's the thing.

115
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,130
She's not really gonna sit on outside.

116
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:12,731
Be patient.

117
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,564
That's not her.

118
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,610
But if she can like Vitsa a dog fight.

119
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,551
I think Rhonda,

120
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,760
I ended up catching a fourth
or fifth round cause Amanda,

121
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,450
she starts off like a tidal wave and
we've seen in her losses she kind of slows

122
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:22,840
down.

123
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,673
She just does.

124
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,101
Yeah.

125
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,920
Well it's going to be interesting to see
if American top team has been able to

126
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,000
do something to mitigate that.

127
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,893
If they've,

128
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,540
who knows what kind of strength
conditioning program she's under now.

129
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,590
The only problem I take class quick.

130
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,310
If Rhonda takes her
down and ends up on top,

131
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,990
she might have a hard time passing
Amanda Nunez Guard and we'll see like Ron

132
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:42,400
does not.

133
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,070
She's not known for guard passing,

134
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,210
so that could be a problem.

135
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,661
Maybe she,

136
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,710
she creates scrambles.

137
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:48,190
Eddie.

138
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,023
That's her thing,

139
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,280
but it's a letter to him to get up.

140
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,080
If she can get her on her back,

141
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,410
how will she,

142
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,170
she deal with passing the guard.

143
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,461
She really doesn't.

144
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,040
She goes to it and then she's
going to transition from there.

145
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,821
You got to deal with it.

146
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:02,140
With a black belt in Jujitsu,

147
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,460
you're going to have to
deal with the guard pass.

148
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,560
It's nine to really submit anybody.

149
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,780
It's not a right.

150
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,410
Rhonda can get on top of her that well.

151
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,580
She's a black mesh chain.

152
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,900
She submitted me should Tate.

153
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,100
She's a black belt in Jujitsu.

154
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,100
Sure.

155
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,230
After Mcmahon too.

156
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,390
She battered both of them
and submitted bullshit.

157
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,081
She what?

158
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,670
Both their ass is different submission
that she submits air McMahon.

159
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
She submitted a cat deaf crap.

160
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,360
The submitted Meesha that beat her up.

161
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,511
No,

162
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:25,931
not cat.

163
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,260
I'm sorry.

164
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,480
She submitted me Hsa.

165
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,610
She submitted nature,

166
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,330
that whole thing.

167
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,760
She did the same thing to Sarah McMahon.

168
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:34,120
I think she cracked her and then
and then put her away with a choke.

169
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,780
The one pretty sure the one thing she
has over Rhonda in this fight is power.

170
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,920
She has vicious power.

171
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:39,620
Striking.

172
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:39,881
Yeah,

173
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,900
and I say that's it.

174
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,230
I'd say that if Rhonda does
come at her full clip like that,

175
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,120
it's a very risky proposition.

176
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,070
She can crack so fucking hard,

177
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,380
but if Rhonda feels like
she can get closer to that.

178
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:51,070
Here we go.

179
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,903
She's not,

180
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,730
she's not dropping punch.

181
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:55,090
Right?

182
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,320
She's not scary.

183
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,243
Oh yeah.

184
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,090
No,

185
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,290
she's,

186
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:58,500
no,

187
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,333
I'm talking about Amanda.

188
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,313
Amanda Nunez.

189
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,510
She's working girls.

190
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,561
Only one shot.

191
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:03,251
She's dropping them.

192
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,420
And Shane a blazer.

193
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:05,950
No,

194
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,910
she's marking girls.

195
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:08,591
Yeah.

196
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,420
She needed a just clinch a punch.

197
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,060
As hard as you only fucking
woman in that division.

198
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,610
She might be the hardest women puncher
in the 135 she's the hardest one.

199
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,430
And Punch her outside of Cyborg.

200
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:18,970
We'll sidewalks,

201
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,520
not one 35 I'm just
saying females in general,

202
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,460
she's the hardest puncher.

203
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,100
Sideboards of different shit.

204
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,711
You want to see her fight?

205
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:27,544
Watch this.

206
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,600
Mine stays the same.

207
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,720
Do you see the fight with Nisha?

208
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,280
I agree.

209
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,360
Did you see her fight with Mischa?

210
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,343
Amanda Nunez.

211
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,980
Nisha?

212
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,700
I,

213
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,091
yes,

214
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:38,380
but I forgot all about
Amanda Nunez Stopping Misha.

215
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,214
She beat her up.

216
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,533
She wanted the belt.

217
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,701
Okay.

218
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,610
What about the Sarah McMahon fight night

219
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,680
go before that because before that is
when she was beating her up on the feet.

220
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,050
Yeah,

221
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,570
I was there.

222
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,170
She's got a nasty jab to match.

223
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:54,791
She steps in.

224
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,350
I'm going to distance to boom,

225
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,184
boom.

226
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,160
Good scramble.

227
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,060
The question is like,

228
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,660
is she gonna?

229
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,990
There's a big difference between dealing
with Rhonda and dealing with Meesha.

230
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,420
Look,

231
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,670
this is a mauling man.

232
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,230
She'd beat the brakes off of her.

233
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,210
Amanda is just putting it to me.

234
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,530
Should tape and you just,

235
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,310
she just has long ass punches
too and then she gets her back.

236
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,470
This size sounds are out.

237
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,660
If Ron is in the right frame of mind,

238
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,760
I think she does rush in
like she usually does.

239
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,530
Probably eats a shot,

240
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,790
but then she gets inside,

241
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,570
gets around to hook,

242
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,280
takes her for a ride and
submits in the first round.

243
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:25,511
God,

244
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,080
I hope nobody tests positive for anything

245
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,090
to so many people again.

246
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,530
Pop.

247
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,450
How about sideboard?

248
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,310
Yeah,

249
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:32,690
yeah.

250
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,320
Game over.

251
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,460
No matter what.

252
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,080
It's for game fucking over men.

253
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,920
Now ruins goes told Ya
fucking told ya my face.

254
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,840
When I watch a UFC promo these days,

255
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,840
I see you're skeptical,

256
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:44,600
liberal and raise you a
super skeptical snake.

257
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,141
That's exact.

258
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,110
Where for about Bro.

259
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,590
That's because they're
not showing Amanda Nunes.

260
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
It is kind of fucked up,

261
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:51,801
but it's also,

262
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:52,101
you know,

263
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,950
like someone pointed out like
when you're watching these promos,

264
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,020
their movies now it's
like this little film.

265
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,700
It's not like training footage.

266
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:02,690
People talking about it like this really
swear slickly produced movie thing.

267
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,460
The story is fucking great.

268
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,671
Oh,

269
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:05,261
Amanda Nunez.

270
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:06,094
A story's great.

271
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,560
Yeah.

272
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,600
First openly gay world champion.

273
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,400
Fricking Brazilian.

274
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:10,881
I mean,

275
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,200
knock out a highlight reel.

276
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,070
Highlight reels.

277
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,281
Yeah.

278
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,600
Smash her fucking work.

279
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,510
Like she's the devil and then,

280
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,261
and then we,

281
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,690
they don't show any Ronit chaos.

282
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,720
It's like that just,

283
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,110
it's like men in black where they just
want you to erase that from your memory.

284
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,280
Any of that,

285
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,110
plenty of that video
going around on its own.

286
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,310
Everybody knows what happened.

287
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,750
It's not something you need to discuss.

288
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,040
I think they could have done it in that
video and then showing the workout to

289
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,520
the return and it might be even
more dramatic showing her crying,

290
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,200
showing her building back up,

291
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,370
picking up the pieces again.

292
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,890
I mean that,

293
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,150
that,

294
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,320
I mean if you wanted to go deep,

295
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,080
you could.

296
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,240
That's going to be in the movie,

297
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:44,511
right?

298
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:48,350
If you have a Rhonda Rousey life story
movie that's gotta be in the movie course

299
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,510
a hundred percent if
she comes back and wins,

300
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,400
I mean that's exactly
what you're going to see.

301
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,940
You're going to see all the pain
Ronda Rousey today right now.

302
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,060
I mean she is who she is right now.

303
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,730
What's going on right now is because
what happened with Holly Holm,

304
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,590
you know this is her comeback does,

305
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,660
is it can't you pull off the comeback?

306
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:06,860
I mean,

307
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,750
the only reason you can
come back against who,

308
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,381
like I said,

309
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:11,870
the average fan is going come
back against who she's been,

310
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,450
the favorite and every
fight she's ever been,

311
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,830
had a complete blackout of Amanda Nunez.

312
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:17,430
Like they haven't showed shit at all.

313
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:21,310
It does very little footage that
they're showing in these problems.

314
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,370
They're showing Nunez.

315
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,040
Stop watching boxing as
to put it back on fucking,

316
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:25,221
yeah,

317
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,430
cause I don't see an fs one.

318
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,260
No,

319
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
they're on boxing.

320
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:30,711
That work.

321
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,930
I'll that Joe tweeted
them know I tweeted a big,

322
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,910
like while I was watching it at home,

323
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,871
I was watching,

324
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,040
I was actually in a hotel room.

325
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,250
I was watching that UFC on Fox where
Michelle Waterson beat Paige vanzant and I

326
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,061
was watching.

327
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:43,251
I'm like,

328
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,390
this is so bizarre.

329
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:48,620
They're not showing the champion to
show in this giant Promo and it's all

330
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:49,041
Rhonda,

331
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,510
which makes some sense because
Rhonda is huge and she,

332
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,360
you want to let everybody
know that she's coming back.

333
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,790
But don't you want to let everybody know
that she's coming back against a killer

334
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,310
against you?

335
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,910
Want everybody know that she's coming
back to fight the champion Joe?

336
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:02,010
Just just from a business aspect.

337
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,350
What in some weird world in MMA,

338
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,490
what if Amanda Nunez Mercer in
the first year she has look,

339
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,310
no one knows it.

340
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,581
Yes.

341
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,414
Is one of them.

342
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,021
One of them.

343
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,210
You seen her face to see her face,

344
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,250
but like most of the pieces about Rhonda,

345
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,180
but there's a few of these,

346
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:15,421
right?

347
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,410
It was a few different ones.

348
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,180
Do you know?

349
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,821
Do you know what I'm saying?

350
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:18,001
Joe?

351
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,410
What happened that she melts Ron here,

352
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:20,244
they're showing,

353
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,120
they showed her head kick and you look
at the Saudis to somebody else's trailer,

354
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:24,420
Bro.

355
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,900
This isn't created shit.

356
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,833
Trying to find the real one.

357
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,450
That's okay.

358
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,283
You don't have to.

359
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,460
It's a lot longer than
an actual promo too.

360
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,870
Like how long has that video right there?

361
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,883
Those two minutes?

362
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,580
Yeah.

363
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,301
Do you see what I'm saying?

364
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:36,421
Jail.

365
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,660
What happens if some weird,

366
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,300
some weird MMA world.

367
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:39,770
A man,

368
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,670
his word is weird at
all and then we're gone.

369
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,750
Do you think that's weird?

370
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,703
Not at all.

371
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,190
No.

372
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,971
It's real dangerous.

373
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:46,160
Marcy is acting like it.

374
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,100
They're putting all their chips in this
basket where if Amanda Nunez does her

375
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:51,870
thing and it happens,

376
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,480
people go,

377
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,560
that was one,

378
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,230
but Rhonda is a thousand
times more popular.

379
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,710
They're not popular then Amanda Nunez.

380
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:02,650
Hundred percent a hundred percent
where the money's coming from money.

381
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,150
But every,

382
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,421
okay.

383
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,300
You've already established she,

384
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:04,920
Rhonda is it,

385
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,311
but hold on.

386
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:06,840
You're already establishing
the Ron is fighting.

387
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:07,920
What do you want everybody to know?

388
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,731
She's fighting a killer.

389
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,450
Who she fighting?

390
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,730
That's what we're tuning him for.

391
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,940
You.

392
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,910
You'll see the matchup.

393
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,560
Alright.

394
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,320
Just selling it as if the whole thing
that you're seeing is her coming back.

395
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,790
Yeah,

396
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,930
but I'm saying in some,

397
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,430
in business one on one,

398
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,760
what happened if that other person wins
and we don't know shit about her UFC

399
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,201
channel,

400
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,034
this is it.

401
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,993
Yeah.

402
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,910
There's just not much of it.

403
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,430
I just don't see a bunch of different,

404
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,040
if she wins then they'll blow her up.

405
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,873
There's still timing.

406
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,170
We have a deadline.

407
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,290
If she willing can
fight Ronda Rousey once,

408
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,280
get this one we manage.

409
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,740
Maybe or twice.

410
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,280
There's no room or no it was,

411
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,240
but at least you know that's
the girl that beat my met.

412
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,450
She'll be just like Holly Holm,

413
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,500
instantly huge.

414
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,540
And I'm on fucking
Ellen and all that shit.

415
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,570
Holly's in an interesting place to
write cause she was instantly huge.

416
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,050
And then she loses two in a row.

417
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,913
Two straight.

418
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,301
Yeah.

419
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,140
And she loses to,

420
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,790
to like two completely different styles.

421
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,760
She gets choked out by Meesha
against a better grappler.

422
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,080
And then she gets a check the lot by
volunteership Chenko and Mount Tina.

423
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:07,890
Just,

424
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,660
I would like to see that
promo if it's possible.

425
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,940
Jamie at the UFC,

426
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:12,900
one of the on the UFC.

427
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:13,734
Youtube.

428
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,580
I know it's youtube,

429
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,590
but there's no real bro.

430
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,270
It's not real.

431
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,290
It's you lie on Youtube.

432
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,500
So here's her like in the top of her
feet and promos from iron bar and people,

433
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,940
you get them from CNN.

434
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:24,774
We all know that.

435
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,980
Smashing people.

436
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,930
So this is uh,

437
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,240
is this the same one as the card?

438
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,240
She uses a different one.

439
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,550
This is the Holly Holly.

440
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,410
So this is going to show
it at the end of November.

441
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,520
What happened there?

442
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,660
They don't show show it.

443
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,621
They cut.

444
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,940
Oh they go black.

445
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:40,050
And then you see Holly winning.

446
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,571
Wow.

447
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:41,404
See what she,

448
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,510
what she likes skeptical.

449
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:43,344
Snake.

450
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,180
Well you got to go down more than
it has to be done more actually.

451
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:49,530
Like you see he's up.

452
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,380
Cause he's progression of his mouth
and the progression of the belt.

453
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,590
You see the progression of the belt,

454
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:55,240
but you don't see her getting head kicked.

455
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,380
That's crazy.

456
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,840
Why would you not show the highlight?

457
00:11:58,841 --> 00:11:59,410
Wow.

458
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,680
What will you doing is you're showing
preferential treatment for one athlete

459
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,514
without a doubt.

460
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,670
And the idea is that the ability
and the fame that she's reached you,

461
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,990
you show preferential treatment
because she's different.

462
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,853
She's special.

463
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,723
She's different.

464
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,920
She's doing massive star.

465
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,000
She is a massive star.

466
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,390
That's the,

467
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,660
that's the girl that's going to put
this the asses in the seats right there.

468
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,230
Man.

469
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,670
She's got bigger than Conor though.

470
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,903
I think you're right.

471
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,010
But as far as women go,

472
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:24,460
she is the,

473
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,510
the corner of the timeout.

474
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,980
I'm done about fighters.

475
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,690
Oh yeah.

476
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:27,870
I'm,

477
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,110
his division is not even close.

478
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,291
No,

479
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:29,951
not even close.

480
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:31,240
There's no one like there's no one like,

481
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,320
but just cause Connors sells more
tickets doesn't mean she's an,

482
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,860
they have multiple stores,

483
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,460
multiple elite stars and she,

484
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:39,970
and here you see Amanda
doing some workouts,

485
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,071
you know,

486
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,660
just lifting some words.

487
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,090
Girlfriend's a strawweight
in the EOC is she?

488
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,953
Yeah.

489
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,090
World Bantamweight champion.

490
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:49,721
Amanda Nunez.

491
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:50,680
And you see some highlights.

492
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,450
So this one is showing more.

493
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,230
So this is a different one than the one
where they roll up the one that they see

494
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:59,140
on TV where they roll up the garage
door and he's here hitting the pads.

495
00:12:59,141 --> 00:12:59,974
Pop up and that's it.

496
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,423
Yeah,

497
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,590
please.

498
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,160
Good though.

499
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,060
It looks good doing that.

500
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:05,200
Very interesting man.

501
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,573
Flash thing.
