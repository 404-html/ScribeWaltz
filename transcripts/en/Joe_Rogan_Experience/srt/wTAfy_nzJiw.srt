1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,280
I mean,
very few people could ever imagine.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,650
Here we go,
four,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,550
three,
two,

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,290
one.
Boom.

5
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:09,240
And we're live saddling up to that 
microphone.

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,550
[inaudible] young lady.
How are you?

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,563
I'm good.
How are you?

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,830
Chelsea?
You always

9
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,960
to see you too.
Thanks for meeting with me.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,470
Saying hi to my son's sons.
A great fucking a.

11
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:20,304
They are man.
And that's what I figured is my next 

12
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,120
step in my,
in the tail.

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,360
My next chapter as.
What's her name?

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,570
The girl that everyone loves,
the girl,

15
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,460
the singer.
She's real tall and skinny.

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,780
Kind of swift.
Yeah.

17
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,200
I can't remember anybody's name anymore.
There's so many people to remember.

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,170
Yeah.
Well she said,

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,013
uh,
she's onto her next chapter and that's 

20
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,240
how I feel too.
Oh,

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,813
it's going to be about how talking to 
women about how to raise functional 

22
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:51,240
sons.
This isn't,

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,133
this is needed in America and I'm going 
to step up and do it because all these 

24
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:59,580
tales.
What with all the news and such obvious.

25
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:00,414
It's obvious to me these women who have 
not raised their sons correctly and I'm 

26
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:06,540
going to correct them because I'm tired 
of them.

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,470
Happen in fucking bitch in a moment.
I'm old.

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,470
I'm going to tell you what to do to 
raise decent sons.

29
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,304
Women.

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,080
Well,
your son said something when,

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,090
when they were doing a little tour of 
the studio,

32
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,210
they saw the picture of Rosa parks and 
your son said,

33
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,800
that's Rosa parks.
And I said,

34
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:26,550
you're one of the few people that ever 
just pointed that out and noticed it.

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,800
And he goes,
of course he goes Roseanne's my mom.

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,090
She raised me right.

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,070
A suite in that suite.
That's something that's getting the uh,

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,933
what do you call it?

39
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,983
What is link?
Know Pat on the back side of modern 

40
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,510
vernacular?
I don't know.

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,140
There's some slang.
I hear him.

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,930
I try to stay here,
but I can't fucking do it.

43
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,210
Well,
you obviously did a great job.

44
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,860
So shout out to shout out.
Shout out to the moms.

45
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,023
How you holding up everything good with 
you right now while I'm smoking like a 

46
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:02,701
bitch was every day was.
Were you smoking before all this?

47
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,020
Hell No.
Well just currently,

48
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,980
secretly doug.
Stan hope got me back on him.

49
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:12,040
The bastard you son of a bitch for like 
15 years in Doug.

50
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:12,874
Stan hope snuck every time I see doug,
I'd smoke one that he's got an evil 

51
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:19,780
spell on me.
Oh,

52
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:22,600
he's evil little man.
He's sober right now.

53
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,310
No cigarettes for him either.
Yeah.

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,020
That he always says that.
No,

55
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,800
he's doing sober October.
Are y'all doing sober October?

56
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,910
Yes.
Wow.

57
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:33,130
Why did you ask me?
I would've sobered up for it.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,560
No.
No.

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,480
You wouldn't have done it.
No.

60
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,480
I want to do a get fucked up on retox.
Retox detox.

61
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,100
That's what my boyfriend johnny calls 
it.

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,610
Time to read talks about how many 
cigarettes are you smoking today?

63
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,860
No.
Well No.

64
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,930
Who's counting?
You just keep walking.

65
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm not smoking.
Less than 10.

66
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,140
Less than 10 is not bad.
Yeah,

67
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,170
not.
It's not as smoking a lot.

68
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,100
See,
I'm cutting

69
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,210
it by 10 every week.
So.

70
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,450
So next week it'll be down to one day.
All week days.

71
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,780
Not Bad.
And I'll see how I deal with it.

72
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,670
If anyone dies,

73
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,750
this whole thing has been completely 
fucking insane and you have to tell you,

74
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,070
but you caught this madness is outrage 
culture right at the peak.

75
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,573
I think you.
You hit peak outrage culture where 

76
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,600
people didn't give a fuck.
If you were making a joke,

77
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,713
didn't give a fuck.
Have you had no idea that that lady was 

78
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,254
black?
Didn't give a fuck what your mental 

79
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,014
state was.
Didn't give a fuck if you were on 

80
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,650
Ambien,
didn't give a fuck if you were drinking.

81
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,800
Didn't give a fuck if you sincerely 
apologized.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
Oh,
go ahead.

83
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,683
I do want to talk.
But they didn't care that you use 

84
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:59,710
sincerely apologized and did not.
Didn't mean to offend.

85
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,450
You were cracking a joke about a woman.

86
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,620
It,
it was funny how they've missed.

87
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,040
Characterize it and lied about it and 
added words to it.

88
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,380
But,
um,

89
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,000
yeah,
I like talking about the tweet.

90
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,050
But uh,
yeah,

91
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,884
I seriously apologize to all whom I 
inadvertently offended and because they 

92
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,970
were offended for it,
it wasn't even what they say.

93
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,250
They were offended because it didn't say
that.

94
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,200
But they think that I tweeted a said she
looked like a,

95
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,960
you know,
somebody and I never said anything about

96
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:39,961
her looks it was a political tweet and 
it's just proof of how everybody's under

97
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:43,390
mass mind control because they took a 
um,

98
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,290
and of course I'm always

99
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,650
interested in that.
You know,

100
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,490
you know,
that I've talked to control.

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,713
That's what I think.
I think people are under the wave of 

102
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:55,144
self mind control.
I don't think it's like there's anybody 

103
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,010
pulling the strings.
You can get out of it.

104
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,903
No,
I don't think anyone's pulling the 

105
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,470
strings.
I don't think this is.

106
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,640
No,
I don't.

107
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,473
I don't think it's by design.
I think people are caught up in a wave 

108
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,310
of fear and paranoia and political 
correctness.

109
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,343
And I think one of the reasons why 
attack they attack someone like you is 

110
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,323
first of all,
you're wealthy and successful and 

111
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:17,290
famous.
You are beautiful.

112
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,150
Thank you.
And one of the best comics of all time.

113
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,150
And you're also a,
you're,

114
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,950
you're an easy target.
You're a white woman.

115
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,240
Your identify as a white woman.
What do you identify as?

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,230
I identify as a Jew.
Well,

117
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,470
there you go and this is what you 
thought this woman was as well.

118
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,690
What is their next?
Like my cousin Sharon,

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,980
she looks just like my cousin,
but it wasn't nothing to do with how she

120
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:45,814
looks that came after my tweet,
but the busted about the point of her 

121
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:52,504
hands,

122
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,340
what she engineered in Iran and I'd been
on there talking about the,

123
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,070
the,

124
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,070
I call it a woman's revolution in neuron
for years and speaking to people in Iran

125
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:08,260
about it and what it means to,
uh,

126
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,133
the,
the women who are second class citizens 

127
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:14,820
there.
And uh,

128
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,580
so if you take that one tweet out of 
like probably I tweet a lot.

129
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,780
So I was probably 400,000.
No,

130
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,110
I don't go crazy.
I stay crazy.

131
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,730
I admit it.
I mean,

132
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:30,810
what the fuck?
They're like,

133
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:34,160
you know what you've said you're crazy 
for years and you know what,

134
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,880
you're crazy.
Well yeah,

135
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,260
I set it for 15 years.
Well it's also all of us are crazy.

136
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,450
All comics are fucking nutso least I 
don't wash my keys like som.

137
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,390
I know some guys,
they got to wash their keys five,

138
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:51,540
six,
seven times where they can go on stage.

139
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,160
What's his name?
Oh,

140
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:55,440
I'm so bad on names.
Chris Farley.

141
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,020
I always asked comics.
You know,

142
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,960
I asked him what's,
what's your secret number?

143
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,410
Which Years Joe?
You don't have a number.

144
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,170
You don't have to do something a number 
of times.

145
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,230
You don't have a number.
What's your birthday?

146
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,190

Eleven 67.
You were born in 1967?

150
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,070
Yes.

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,960
Um,

152
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,520
I was in the Utah State Hospital.
When you were born,

153
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,550
what were you doing given birth?
No,

154
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,760
I was in a mental institution.
That was my first hospitalization.

155
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,373
It lasted for nine months and it was the
Utah State Hospital in Provo where the 

156
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:47,854
osmonds are from.
So it's was always a big Marie Osmond 

157
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,290
Fan.
The,

158
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,650
the mental health aspect of this 
conversation is an important one because

159
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,650
here's my take on this.
Extremely important.

160
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,513
It is important.
And yesterday was mental health 

161
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,560
awareness day.
Yes,

162
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:03,394
I know and I was quite aware of being 
mentally healthy yesterday as I was 

163
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:11,550
smoking.
If someone,

164
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,990
all I eat is cheese.
If someone has a,

165
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,950
an injured leg,
you don't expect them to run marathons.

166
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,770
If someone has a,
you know,

167
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,753
something wrong with their liver,
you don't expect them to process food 

168
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,420
correctly.
You don't blame it on them,

169
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,183
but if someone has a mental health issue
and they do something erratic or they 

170
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:35,020
say something that's inappropriate and 
then they apologize for it.

171
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,530
Or if they're Canadian or if they're a 
comedian and you,

172
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:43,531
you've had the gitelman real diagnosed,
treated mental health issues,

173
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,500
trauma related issues.
There you go.

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
How'd you like that?
It's a little bit better.

175
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,880
Kenya.
Yeah,

176
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,100
but for whatever reason,
people to pretend that this

177
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,933
is a deliberate act by calculating 
person who is just being an asshole and 

178
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,120
that's not the case.
You're not an asshole at this time.

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,110
I have been an asshole.
But you weren't there but you weren't.

180
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,550
That's not what you were doing now.
I was talking about Iran and the woman's

181
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,680
revelation there and how,
uh,

182
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,800
how,
and it's always been because,

183
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:20,634
you know,
what I had my dna done because I wanted 

184
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,850
to know and I am of North African 
ancestry,

185
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,140
how much.
It's like a very small percentage,

186
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,003
but it was something like 25,000
years ago they left North Africa which 

187
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:40,851
has kind of Syria and they went to 
Lithuania and I'm Russia and uh,

188
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,003
some Europe to July 23 and me or 
someplace and just answered so many 

189
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,650
questions for,
you know,

190
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:55,770
why I feel this yearning towards that 
part of the world.

191
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,390
But I do,
you know,

192
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,420
and especially the geopolitics there,
some have always intrigued me and I have

193
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:08,220
always attempted to use my voice to um,
you know,

194
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,060
support all of the people there.
Well,

195
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,380
it's fast.
So it was,

196
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,810
you know,
this one tweet was like about.

197
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,153
It was about,

198
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,143
I mean,
it's actually a genius tweet if you 

199
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:29,780
really fucking knows what exactly did 
you say it was?

200
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,110
Find the tweet,
Jamie,

201
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,443
I'll tell you if it's a artificially 
rendered because an artificially 

202
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:36,744
rendered one.
There's a lot of them were people 

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,210
distorted what you actually said it was 
racist Roseanne,

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,433
and then a couple of weeks later it was 
disgraced comic Roseanne and her racist 

205
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:52,731
tweet and then after that it was 
disgraced comic can her offensive racist

206
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,930
tweet because there's all these hoops 
you gotta jump through,

207
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:01,380
you know,
they're never done punishing you.

208
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,363
Well,
look were saying before all my friends 

209
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:05,244
said,
don't apologize to social justice 

210
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,360
warriors because that's the kiss of 
death.

211
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:12,150
That's like chum in the water,
blood in the water,

212
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,860
you know?
It's definitely a little bit of that.

213
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,080
But what I was saying before,
the podcast to use,

214
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:17,700
I don't,
I don't really.

215
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,683
What I really think happens is they find
a target and they don't care if it's a 

216
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:24,110
viable target,
but once the target gets greenlit,

217
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,390
they go after you until some new target 
comes along until only distraction.

218
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:30,860
That target.
Yes,

219
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,120
sure.
It's recreational outrage.

220
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:33,954
They find the attack you and they go 
after you and they to what the fuck you 

221
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:42,630
said and obviously they don't.
That's what kind of cracks me up.

222
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:43,464
It's like,
Hey,

223
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,660
look at this.
Look what they're saying and that meant,

224
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,553
and you know,
I'm not going to bow down before them 

225
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,480
and say you were right and they want me 
to,

226
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,170
but they weren't right.
I'm right.

227
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,740
I wrote it bitch,
so I know what I meant,

228
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,050
so you don't get to tell me what I 
meant,

229
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,913
but they don't care.
The thing is they don't want to look at 

230
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:02,890
it rationally and say,
Oh,

231
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:05,780
here's a woman that has a history of 
mental health problem.

232
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,613
She was on Ambien and drinking and she 
says something that is slightly 

233
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:13,690
irrational,
but given your explanation of it,

234
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,490
well you did.
She was black dog.

235
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,360
Both Ali think all my tweets make no 
sense.

236
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,390
You have been saying that for fucking 
here since I went on twitter.

237
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:24,910
You're like,
her tweets are just buttoned straight up

238
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,070
crazy.
Have some crazy tweets for sure.

239
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,730
I don't think they're crazy.
You just don't get 'em.

240
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:31,923
Well,
maybe if I was in the same mindset as 

241
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,140
you,
I would get them.

242
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,340
Yeah,
but obviously no one is.

243
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,174
When I say crazy,
I think they don't think like other 

244
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:41,164
people.
I know that I've always known that my 

245
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:46,720
whole life I'd always test other people,
see what they were thinking like as even

246
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:50,350
as a kid I'd be like,
but I try to fit in.

247
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,120
They go play barbies,
you know,

248
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,450
and I'm like,
fucking,

249
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,790
I don't want to.
And I'm like,

250
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,624
okay,
well let's have Barbie be a resistance 

251
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:01,640
fighter that paratroops into,
you know,

252
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,740
into the hidden lines of the German 
thing and save all the Jews.

253
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,130
And they'd go,
you have to be her cousin skipper.

254
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,023
Then they'd hand me the skipper doll.
I always had to personify skipper and 

255
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:16,800
they got to be Barbie.
I didn't even know a Barbie.

256
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,070
Had a cousin.
Yeah.

257
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:18,904
Skipper.
She has a little tiny tits and I 

258
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,920
resented that because I always had very 
large pendulous breasts since I was four

259
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,474
or five.

260
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,550
I did.
I,

261
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,990
I don't think or look like other people.
I think I'm an alien.

262
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,940
Really.
What planet you think you'd be from?

263
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,080
Um,
well,

264
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:44,020
somebody told me as from the eighties.
Do you know anything about that?

265
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,670
Yeah,
that's the people that call the art bell

266
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:46,504
show.
They would always say that they say 

267
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,370
round faces are from Pat.
You see you got a round face.

268
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,240
That's what I told you.
I don't even go by what people look like

269
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,610
except for I do look at the shape of 
their head.

270
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:00,460
I have to admit that's how I classify 
people.

271
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:05,461
I classified people my own way because I
don't think like everybody else thinks I

272
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,603
take a person shape of their head and 
that's that group they represent to me 

273
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,110
and I have noticed that the Dutch have 
the largest heads people,

274
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,230
the Dutch have pure score.
Not all of them of course,

275
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,730
but some of them you're the average 
height for a Dutch person,

276
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,470
like six feet tall.
I know women vikings.

277
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,860
Yeah.
Biking.

278
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,590
I love all the different peoples of the 
earth because they all have a variety of

279
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:38,860
foods that I enjoy.
So I like to,

280
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,350
you know,
I don't just mix with one kind of person

281
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:42,184
in my real life.
I'm mixed with all kinds of people and 

282
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,470
you know,
because I'll go anywhere for free meal,

283
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,720
but I.
But I love,

284
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,040
I love cultures and I love

285
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,120
all people.
That's all.

286
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,050
I want to say,
you know,

287
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,810
I would never,
I'm not that person,

288
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,930
so you're not a racist by any stretch of
the imagination,

289
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:03,320
but you are a person that I am a 
misanthropy.

290
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,213
I'm a misanthrope misanthrope,
but I am a respect truss of no man or 

291
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,940
woman,
but most comedians,

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,020
yeah,
we're all like that,

293
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:12,854
right?
Misanthropic intentions or you have to 

294
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,514
hate all people the same,
but you definitely have to mock and 

295
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:20,181
make.
I mean,

296
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:24,200
it's part of your job description to 
mock and make fun of and you,

297
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,870
you look for things that are irritating 
about everything.

298
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,070
No Shit.
Right?

299
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,930
That's part of the job and not only 
that,

300
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:30,764
that was part of your character on your 
show was part of the reason why ABC 

301
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:34,304
wanted you back.
It's part of the reason why the show 

302
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,880
became such a giant hit and it's 
returned.

303
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,923
I mean,
it was a fucking huge hit coming right 

304
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:41,420
out of the gate.
Yep.

305
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,913
Twenty 8 million people.
That's a lot of fucking panel number 

306
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,030
one.
Every episode.

307
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,660
Yeah.
That's a lot of people and a lot of that

308
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:53,660
was because people love this aspect of 
you,

309
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,200
but as soon as you get labeled a racist,
everybody throws their hands up.

310
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:57,861
It goes,
Whoa,

311
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,290
I didn't know she was racist.
She's racist,

312
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,550
and they don't care about nuance.
They don't care about the details.

313
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:06,950
They don't care about ambien.
They don't care about alcohol.

314
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,843
When I called you on the phone was the 
first thing that I think I've learned 

315
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:12,500
gel well,
if you're gonna,

316
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,850
take an ambien down.
Not do not drink a beer.

317
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,060
Always only drink a wine.
Yes,

318
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,193
with Ambien.
I have a good friend of mine who is one 

319
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:23,744
of the nicest,
most respectful guys you ever want to 

320
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:26,390
meet.

321
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,223
He woke up in Germany on a plane,
covered in his own vomit with the 

322
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:32,720
police,
standing over him,

323
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,590
asking him if he knew what happened.
He ended up getting arrested.

324
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,513
They brought him to the jail in Germany 
and they add and he's a ceo of a large 

325
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:46,010
company and they went over things with 
him and they said,

326
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:47,360
what happened?
What do you remember?

327
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,194
He goes,
well,

328
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,840
I remember taking an Ambien and then 
then I went to sleep and then I had a,

329
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,560
I guess I had a beer at some point in 
time and they go,

330
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:55,394
okay,
stop.

331
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,090
This is what happened,
and so they described how he was hitting

332
00:16:59,091 --> 00:16:59,924
on the stewardesses and trying to start 
fights with men in the cabin and wasn't 

333
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:06,830
as being as real.
Selfie was on.

334
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:10,790
Ambient distorts.
He's the nicest guy.

335
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,624
If you knew this guy,
you would never in a million years 

336
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:17,810
believed that he was capable of anything
remotely like this and the German people

337
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,910
actually let him stay in the country.

338
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,250
They let him continue his vacation.
They're like,

339
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,084
okay,
for gay family promise not to do that 

340
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:24,741
again.
He goes,

341
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:26,660
I'm never fucking taking that shit again
in my life,

342
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,140
and one of the things that I said to you
when I called you up,

343
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:32,500
I said,
what were you doing well?

344
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,970
And you told me you were on Ambien,
and I said,

345
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,804
okay,
we'll stop right there because I know 

346
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:37,844
quite a bit about that because I've had 
personal experiences with friends that 

347
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:41,504
have had real issues with ambien.
I had a bit I did in my act about a 

348
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,564
friend of mine who literally made a meal
while he was on Ambien cooked at the 

349
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:50,080
supermarket,
what God

350
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,990
food look at Tiger Woods that he was on 
that and then he'd go driving off in the

351
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,050
golf cart to meet some check,
you know,

352
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,190
g and that I don't understand where 
people said they had sex on Ambien.

353
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,510
People say that's a big thing that 
people take ambien to have sex.

354
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,350
I don't even know how they can stay at.
I guess they don't stay awake,

355
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:14,370
but another part of them wakes up and 
their sex part comes out.

356
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,750
That's all I can figure.

357
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,490
I've never taken it.
I'm terrified of the song ever take.

358
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,041
Yeah.
I,

359
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,220
I get.
Nope.

360
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,870
I have no problem going to sleep.
I've never had.

361
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,860
I do,
but you know,

362
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:26,710
what I found is thc.
They sell it down at uh,

363
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,480
the dispensary and there's one for sleep
at night.

364
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,040
And um,
I've been doing that and I,

365
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,770
I've been sleeping through the night 
when I was taking the sleeping thing,

366
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,200
the sleep and drug ambien.
Well,

367
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:42,920
I don't want to say it because we don't 
want to get some candy,

368
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,940
man.
You don't want to say it three times.

369
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,780
You don't get sued.
Not

370
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,050
say an Ambien.
I bet you they give a fuck.

371
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,450
Did you see their choice?
They said,

372
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,070
I didn't see that today.
Do you see that?

373
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,210
Yeah.
Well,

374
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,550
you know,
I had Hamilton Morris on the podcast who

375
00:18:57,551 --> 00:19:01,900
is a drug expert and he.
He writes for advice and it does a piece

376
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:06,190
for vice and he went into the advice 
after your incident.

377
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:10,770
He came on and went in great detail 
about how that.

378
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,510
That is something that happens to people
that were.

379
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:15,190
They have no idea what the fuck they're 
saying.

380
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:18,370
It's called a hypnotic.
That is the classification of drugs that

381
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,223
it falls under and people do all sorts 
of involuntary things when they're on 

382
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:22,931
it.
No,

383
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:25,180
it doesn't just make you say racist 
things,

384
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,880
but you didn't say anything 
intentionally racist.

385
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,043
No.

386
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,410
About the work of Valerie Jarrett's 
hands and I also was referencing my very

387
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:36,244
favorite movie.
So if we could talk about how fucking 

388
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:41,830
awesome that movie planet of the Apes 
Great fucking movie.

389
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:47,550
It's the definitive people get your come
on people now.

390
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,950
It's like,
come on.

391
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,920
It's like the hundredth monkey.
Is that the thing?

392
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,710
Is that the name of it?
That's what it is.

393
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,850
100 monkey on the typewriter.
They write up those monkeys.

394
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,713
What is it?
How is that work that if you have a 

395
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:04,474
certain amount of monkeys,
the hundredth monkey that changes 

396
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:07,220
everything,
right?

397
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,350
If,
if a,

398
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,650
if a species does something 99 times in 
a row,

399
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,950
the hundredth time it's gotten into 
their DNA.

400
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,500
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

401
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,550
and then they evolve to the next level.

402
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,200
Hundredth monkey effect or just monkey 
effect is a hypothetical phenomenon.

403
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,220
Which new behavior ideas co claim to 
spread rapidly by unexplained means from

404
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:30,360
one group to all related groups.
Once a critical number of members of one

405
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:33,240
group exhibit a new behavior or 
acknowledged that new idea.

406
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

407
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,310
Well the thing is a lot of people put 
pictures of that woman right next to the

408
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,510
lady picture.

409
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,690
I understand the picture was put up 
after my tweet.

410
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,120
I understand,
but I am not going to do with that.

411
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,470
I didn't say she looked like anything 
real seriously.

412
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm not that fucking shallow.
Okay.

413
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:57,661
I never talk about nobody's looks unless
they're thin and blonde and I'm jealous,

414
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,980
but you know,
and youthful now but or whatever.

415
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,160
But wasn't there another tweet that you 
made a long time ago about?

416
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Who was that other woman?
Susan Rice?

417
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,893
Yeah.
Well you said she has giant swing eight 

418
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:14,254
balls that she's a man.
Let me explain that now because this is 

419
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:19,684
the regional listic regionalism.
I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah 

420
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:29,350
when we got married and are we heard our
moms do it too.

421
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,300
It's always,
where's your ape?

422
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,261
They go,
what?

423
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:35,170
You're doing this Sunday it.
And he's like,

424
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:36,370
oh,
he's watching football.

425
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:37,870
All good.
Let's go out to lunch,

426
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:38,704
you know,
is all,

427
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,750
all of the men were all apes.

428
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,680
That's how it is in a breeder culture,
like Salt Lake City,

429
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,480
breeder cheerleader culture.
So it's like,

430
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:51,260
where's your ape?
And was like,

431
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,173
man,
you're a passive big fucking swing and 

432
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,390
eight balls.
I give them that,

433
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,620
you know,
it's a regional,

434
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:59,770
holistic thing.
And uh,

435
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,310
you know,
so I used it and apologize,

436
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,230
but you know,
because I didn't realize,

437
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,113
you know,
I just sometimes forget what race 

438
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:12,130
everybody is as if I could tell half the
time anyway,

439
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,370
I can't even see people that tell you 
the truth.

440
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,563
I need like bifocals trifocals and I 
never identified other human beings by 

441
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:22,444
what they looked like for God's sake.
I just could tell if I felt a liking to 

442
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:26,704
him.
You know,

443
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,643
whatever they looked like.
Point is the only two things over the 

444
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:34,330
course of thousands of don't mess my 
point.

445
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,010
I said,
Susan Rice,

446
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,610
let's say that she has,
she has incredible audacity.

447
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,640
That's what I meant.
And she does.

448
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,070
But you didn't mean it in a 
complimentary way.

449
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,800
If someone is audacious,
is that negative or positive?

450
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,200
You weren't you talking about her in a 
negative way though?

451
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,010
I said she has a lot of audacity.
That's what I meant.

452
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,683
She does whatever it was that was,
that was one that got brought up as 

453
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:10,134
well.
That was also in the middle of a huge 

454
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,670
conversation about,
you know,

455
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,513
Ben Gazi and the Iran deal.
Those are the two things are two of the 

456
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:21,570
three things that I like to do on 
twitter,

457
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:24,770
although I'm no longer on there.
Yeah.

458
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,700
For you.
Yeah.

459
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,750
I was glad to see Kanye west got off to.
Yeah,

460
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,830
he deleted all his account last week and
I was glad to because you're just like,

461
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,460
once you're a target it's just too 
painful.

462
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,360
Well definitely shouldn't be reading 
that shit.

463
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,440
No,
I don't read it.

464
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,850
But um.
Well,

465
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,010
when

466
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,780
you become a target,
how do you know if you don't read it?

467
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,143
Well,
I know what I've lived through when it 

468
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,920
first happened and that's been like four
or so months ago,

469
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,980
so I just know how I've reacted in my 
real life since that happened to me.

470
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,160
How long for things die off to die off?

471
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,310
What do you slow down where they weren't
just coming after you constantly,

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,833
like I told you that news crews,
when they found out that you were going 

473
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:14,120
to come on the podcast the first time 
they were trying to show up at my house,

474
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,920
they were trying to show up at the 
studio.

475
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,810
They were trying to find me at the 
comedy store.

476
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,340
I mean they were just trying to hunt 
down anything about you.

477
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,633
I know I'm snake and segues from my 
boyfriend because we were at my mom's 

478
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:27,594
house when I did it.
You know what we were at home in Salt 

479
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,660
Lake City when I tweeted at 2:11
AM.

480
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,750
I just woke up and I had this thought in
my head,

481
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:38,850
oh my God,
this can make so much sense.

482
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,443
And then I tweeted it and I went right 
back to sleep and when I woke up at 

483
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:46,170
seven,
the shit had hit the fan,

484
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:47,290
you know?
Yeah.

485
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,740
But I was like,
I'm going to expound on this later.

486
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:51,340
That was one of those kinds of things,
right.

487
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,890
You just want to get it down.
And I,

488
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,460
you know,
always slept with my computer and tweet.

489
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,670
When I wake up like one year old,
you have to go to the bathroom a lot.

490
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:01,290
So I always tweet and fall back to 
sleep.

491
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,170
See?
And then on the ambient tweets,

492
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,610
my daughter,
I used to always,

493
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,060
when I took my Ambien,
I call my daughter and she or she called

494
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:09,750
me.
She goes,

495
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,240
mom,
you,

496
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,930
you're starting to do the Ambien tweets.
Get off,

497
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,340
get off the twitter,
you know.

498
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,220
But uh,
I saw,

499
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:18,330
I just called my daughter.
Then every night when I,

500
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,660
when I was doing the Ambien and I'd go,
you know what,

501
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,210
here comes a big fish.
She recorded it.

502
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,210
Here comes a big fish right through my 
window.

503
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,300
All he's getting stuck in the mirror and
should,

504
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,150
that's for sure.

505
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,640
He goes,
mom turned it all off and go to sleep.

506
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,073
I have to have my family telling me that
because it almost need her standing 

507
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,310
guard by your bed.
Hold on,

508
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:42,790
let me read that before you tweet it.
No,

509
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,170
no,
no,

510
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,940
no,
it doesn't.

511
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,280
Now

512
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,680
she don't.
She took my twitter account away.

513
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,473
We'll use tweets.
All these liberal things that I want to 

514
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:56,241
get just get up in her face and smack 
around for no on her own.

515
00:25:56,981 --> 00:25:57,814
And I'm like,
well how come it's okay for you to say 

516
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,960
this?
But it ain't for me.

517
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:03,120
Well mother,
I didn't lose everything.

518
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,850
Oh,
she's trying to help you.

519
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,050
I'm like,
AH,

520
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,940
yeah.
You and your fucking hell

521
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,020
sticks it in your face.
Is your issue serious?

522
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:13,810
Liberal?
Are

523
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,643
they all.
All three of my daughters are serious 

524
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,553
social justice warrior types.
And what did they think about your 

525
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:23,070
position as well?
They think I'm a frigging correct.

526
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,280
They think I'm crazy.
They always did like,

527
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:27,114
you know,
they always thought all my choice for 

528
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:29,944
president were crazy.
But then oddly they were all very 

529
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:37,690
supportive when I personally ran for 
president in 2012.

530
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,050
They were really supportive of me.
Then you're their mom.

531
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,400
Yeah.
That was cool.

532
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,180
But like all other times it's like,
Oh god,

533
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:47,580
mother,
it's your generation.

534
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,120
The baby boomers are the reason 
everything is all fucked up.

535
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,550
So stop letting yourself pop back up.

536
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,690
Conversations in the bar.
Household.

537
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,673
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

538
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,180
Oh yeah.
What,

539
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:05,100
what was it that when you first got 
brought into a mental hospital,

540
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,993
what was it about?

541
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,330
Well,
I had got hit by a car and the,

542
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:13,480
uh,
the hood ornament went in my head and my

543
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:18,481
brains and scramble them and I,
I used to be an a plus math student.

544
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:23,170
I was just great in geometry.
Oh my God,

545
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:28,171
I loved geometry.
I got straight a's and then,

546
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,070
you know,
I sort of fell apart after that.

547
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:33,580
Took a long time to heal from it.
And um,

548
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,070
you know,
uh,

549
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,510
how much did you personality change?
Oh,

550
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:39,610
it changed drastically,
but you know,

551
00:27:39,611 --> 00:27:43,420
you read all that stuff about a 
traumatic head injuries now because I do

552
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,290
read a lot and talked to a lot of 
football players who have the same thing

553
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,540
and we do discuss it.
Yeah,

554
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,300
you change right away.
Yeah,

555
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,200
it's still you,
but it's like a,

556
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,350
it's kind of like an artel artificial 
intelligence.

557
00:27:57,351 --> 00:27:58,184
You do you find that,
did you find that you became much more 

558
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:01,724
impulsive?

559
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,670
Oh yeah.
I,

560
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,110
well,
yeah.

561
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,033
Here's what happened.
I was crossing the street on my way to 

562
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:12,610
school.
How old were you?

563
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,800
I was 16.
No,

564
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:17,634
it's 15.
Go on to first week of high school and 

565
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:30,161
uh,
I was a big nerd and anyway,

566
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,900
uh,
was crossing the street and it was a top

567
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:40,310
of the hill and this woman girl,
she was on her way to the university and

568
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:45,311
the sun blinded her and she ran me over.
And uh,

569
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,690
the rest is history.
How,

570
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,520
how long were you in the hospital for 
[inaudible]?

571
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,910
So first you must have been,
you must have been in a medical hospital

572
00:28:56,911 --> 00:29:01,320
first and then you were admitted to a 
mental hospital after about three months

573
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,360
in between.
Right?

574
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,320
Uh,
but I was in the hospital for awhile,

575
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,173
you know,

576
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,243
and uh,
I had a head concussion and a brain 

577
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:13,540
concussion and I had hamburger,
meat for legs.

578
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,450
So they did all these,
um,

579
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,330
what do they call them?
Skin grafts on my legs.

580
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,560
A and m?
Yeah.

581
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:26,594
I was in there for awhile.
Then I came out of there and I had 

582
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:30,044
forgotten everything about math when I 
returned to school where it's a matter 

583
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,510
of weeks after that,
maybe two months.

584
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:39,440
So I'm really bad on time now.
But uh,

585
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,050
and I had forgotten all my math and it 
was just terrible.

586
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,530
That was a big depressive depression I 
went into because I couldn't remember.

587
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,360
I couldn't remember things,
you know?

588
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,650
And also I became way more impulsive.
Then I was like,

589
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,663
I don't know what I did.
Then I started going really out there 

590
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,360
into the ethers.
I went way out there.

591
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,060
Like how so way out,
you know,

592
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:09,160
how you go way out.
Do you ever go away out?

593
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,160
Not really.
I've had a lot of head injuries.

594
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,130
Oh yeah.
I've been but not terrible.

595
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,383
Mostly just punches and kicks,
nothin like car accidents or never 

596
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:24,340
played football,
but my head injuries have,

597
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,223
you know,
there were just more of a cumulative 

598
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,570
when I was young,
until I was about 21,

599
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:29,620
22.
I stopped,

600
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,900
stopped fighting,
stop sparring,

601
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,380
but nothing.
But uh,

602
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,260
definitely

603
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,470
I'm subject to impulsive behavior.
Stealing.

604
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,530
Yeah.
But I can't keep it under wraps.

605
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,210
I keep it under control because I'm 
aware of it.

606
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,550
But when I was younger I didn't 
understand what was going on.

607
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,540
I would just be subject to whims,
very addictive behavior.

608
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,960
But I've tried to keep it positive,
but it would be addicted to things,

609
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,920
addicted to doing things,
addicted to games,

610
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,160
addicted like ridiculously addictive,
like spend 10,

611
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:02,410
12,
14 hours a day playing video games.

612
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,330
That kind of shit.
My Kid.

613
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,283
Yeah.
Well it's just normal because video 

614
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,660
games are awesome.
But yeah,

615
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,020
it would be for me to be everything,
martial arts,

616
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:11,854
pool,
whatever do is I'll just be completely 

617
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,164
obsessed with it and be thinking about 
it all day in port where it wasn't 

618
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:18,064
necessarily healthy.
And just on a whim I would just want to 

619
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:21,150
go do something.
I just,

620
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:24,250
I almost had no control over 
compulsion's,

621
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,710
you know,
and I think some of that is it.

622
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,053
Whatever brain injuries that I've had 
are very mild in comparison to a lot of 

623
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:32,164
people that I know,
certainly very mild in comparison to 

624
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:35,254
yours.

625
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,810
But there was a lot of trauma in the 
state hospital that,

626
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,430
you know,
I'm like,

627
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:45,680
you know,
being there and seeing and experiencing.

628
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,010
And how long did that for nine months.

629
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,470
So what was it that they brought you in 
there for?

630
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,453
What was,
how were you behaving that they decided 

631
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:57,220
that you needed to be admitted?

632
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,540
I was out there.
You say that like,

633
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,374
what does that mean?

634
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,443
Um,

635
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,980
I don't think there's any words.
The English you just can't understand,

636
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:11,814
didn't have a control of reality.
You didn't have control of your 

637
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:16,920
behavior.
Your thinking was screwed up.

638
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,310
I was,
you know,

639
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,413
not thinking like the normal thing that 
they say you should be thinking about 

640
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,560
and,
but people round you had realized it,

641
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,670
that it was,
it was so bad that they had to admit you

642
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:30,300
to a hospital.
It wasn't just A.

643
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,860
Oh,
Rosanne.

644
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,660
She's eccentric.
It was.

645
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,523
She needs

646
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,190
actual medical help.
Yeah.

647
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,070
I asked to be admitted.
Do you knew something was really wrong?

648
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,060
She

649
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,893
finally admitted it was.
Did you know at the time were you 

650
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,640
completely aware that it was connected 
to your car accident?

651
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,060
Uh,
no.

652
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,230
You just knew something was wrong.
Yeah.

653
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,853
And back then they didn't really kind of
understand that the way they understand 

654
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:56,754
it now,

655
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,943
no,
they didn't understand too much about 

656
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:04,121
bipolar disorder or they knew nothing 
about multiple personality disorder.

657
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,600
Trauma related trauma related.
Yeah.

658
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,310
PTSD,
now they call everything pts.

659
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,920
Yeah.
They don't even say d anymore.

660
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,690
They say pts post traumatic stress.

661
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,560
So when they admitted you,
what was the treatment like?

662
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:24,050
What did they do to you when you were 
inside the mental hospital?

663
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,793
Well,
they right away put me on an anti 

664
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,530
psychotic.
What was it?

665
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:31,770
Do you remember?
Mallory?

666
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,940
What did that do?
I don't know.

667
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,020
I wasn't there.
You weren't there.

668
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:40,550
You were gone.
I was gone.

669
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,683
I was just watching these people.
I was in the mental institution width 

670
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:47,840
and I wanted to tell that story because 
there was this one lady.

671
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,360
I think I told this to Paul reubens too.
I think it might be worried.

672
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,203
Got Large Marge.
But there's this one lady and she's in 

673
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:57,360
this cage.
No,

674
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,740
she's in a cage with keys on our ward 
there.

675
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,290
And uh,
uh,

676
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,540
Christ,
I can't remember her name either.

677
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,040
Marge,
her name was march.

678
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,160
Yeah.
And she's about 600,

679
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:13,030
700 pounds.
And uh,

680
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,260
she is funnier than hell,
you know,

681
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,100
I thought,
man,

682
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:17,960
this,
this chick's got smooth lines,

683
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,540
you know,
and I,

684
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,590
it's traded lines with her and she'd 
laugh.

685
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,280
You know,
you know,

686
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,143
I was like jokes,
you can always find a job wherever you 

687
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:27,104
are,
you know,

688
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,010
that's the key to life I think.
But um,

689
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,521
so she,
oh,

690
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:38,930
everybody called me junkie.
That was my name Chunky.

691
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,243
And uh,
there was another girl in their name 

692
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:45,014
shorty,
so it was chunky and shorty where you 

693
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:50,360
were like a duo,
but anyway,

694
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,920
um,
so she's like,

695
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:52,521
hey,
Roseanne,

696
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:53,354
get what's her name's keys when they go 
to dinner and open this up here and you 

697
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,240
know,
come in here.

698
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,590
I'm like,
okay,

699
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,543
you know,
cause,

700
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,480
you know,
after all I was crazy too.

701
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,370
And uh,
I don't trust it.

702
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,120
I don't know,
I just always,

703
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,050
I never questioned that there was danger
anywhere.

704
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,330
I always got in trouble,
you know,

705
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,610
got beat up something,
you know.

706
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,660
But uh,
so I did it,

707
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,530
you know,
and I can't all cut.

708
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,020
That was her name,
the head nurse.

709
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,640
I hated her because she told me I needed
a baby.

710
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,350
I'll tell that story later.
It was horrifying.

711
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:31,760
It changed my life.
But anyway,

712
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:32,594
so they all go to dinner.
So I go in there and steal the keys out 

713
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,290
of the thing where they are,
you know,

714
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,760
the attendance and not go in there with 
marge and leave the keys in the door and

715
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:48,290
close the door.
Yeah.

716
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,880
So I'm like,
hey mark,

717
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,060
how's it going?
Margin.

718
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,260
And she's like,
chunky.

719
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,903
You know why they put me in this cage?
Don't you take some draggers everywhere 

720
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,190
I go,
well,

721
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,540
why?
No,

722
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,970
I don't know why.
Well,

723
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,660
chunky because they consider me to be 
dangerous.

724
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,770
I'm like,
how come I am?

725
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,270
I'm like Gomer pyle,
serious

726
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,210
play and I'm total gold when you're like
16 at the time.

727
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,220
15 about eight minutes into it I 
realized,

728
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,470
Oh shit.
Oh Shit,

729
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,053
something's going on here.
That's how long it always took me to 

730
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:49,970
like zero in,
on what's happening because I'm not even

731
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:50,990
there,
you know?

732
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:53,060
I'm always ignoring when other people 
talk.

733
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:57,400
I don't listen to me,
you know?

734
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,120
So I'm always in my own head.
I never get out really except for when I

735
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:03,770
work.
But uh,

736
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,770
so uh,
then it got done.

737
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:07,630
It took a turn,
you know,

738
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,473
she's like,
so it got to a why do they consider you 

739
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:15,770
dangerous?
You know,

740
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,060
I had to ask it because she kept on 
getting me there to that point where she

741
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:23,150
wanted me to ask it.
I was trying to delay it,

742
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,013
you know,
because I knew they'd be back in 40 

743
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:29,540
minutes and it was like going on 20 now 
she goes,

744
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm in here because that's my voice.
I got to do margin.

745
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,650
I'm in here because I broke a couple 
attendants backs and they tell you that.

746
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,403
No

747
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,280
My.
How'd you do that?

748
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,920
And then my head,
I'm thinking,

749
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,560
don't change.
Don't miss a beat.

750
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,960
Don't miss a breath.
Don't look nowhere.

751
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,090
Just to keep on Ecmo.
You know,

752
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,310
Utah,
your dog girl.

753
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,253
She knew she was dangerous.
Well that's when it hit my head that it 

754
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:03,990
was,
oh,

755
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,540
she's talking about,
you know,

756
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm a,
I'm feeling like pray,

757
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,690
right.
You know,

758
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,820
and I go,
how'd you do that?

759
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,750
Because I'd figured out,
oh,

760
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,800
it's an accident.
You know,

761
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,860
it's good.
All Marge,

762
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:21,570
she tells good jokes.
She goes,

763
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:22,321
well,
it's easy.

764
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:24,540
You just know I'm doing me again.
I got to do her.

765
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,433
It's easy.
You just put one hand here and one hand 

766
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,910
here and then you're like,
oh,

767
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,133
oh

768
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,833
hmm.

769
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,180
Where'd you learn that?
I'm changing the subject and 100.

770
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,600
How was your mom?
What was the school like?

771
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:43,880
You went to.
What's your favorite book?

772
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:46,160
What's your favorite color?
What kind of ice cream you like?

773
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,670
You ever seen that there's worms in the 
oatmeal.

774
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,570
You ever noticed that she started?
That one.

775
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:54,430
Got Her.
She's like,

776
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:57,530
yeah,
I did a good notice.

777
00:38:57,531 --> 00:39:00,530
I was crawling motherfuckers.
I go,

778
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:01,360
yeah,
next week.

779
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,620
Does the effect that this shoe,
this one,

780
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:04,454
you know,
I like suddenly I'm transported to a 

781
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,280
confederacy of dunces when he's on the 
thing of,

782
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,210
against Levi pants.
You remember that rant in that book?

783
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,510
So I'm just tap dancing really?
And uh,

784
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,860
then I hear it click.
Fuck man.

785
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,880
I grabbed,
I got fumbled the keys out of the door,

786
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:31,630
put them back in the uh,
attendance room went my room.

787
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,410
When you said you hear click.
Yeah,

788
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:36,244
I knew the first door got opened.
There was two doors that I heard the 

789
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,810
first door open.
They're coming back from,

790
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,140
from dinner.
So you got away from us,

791
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:45,040
be sick,
you know,

792
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:48,070
in my room.
That's why I didn't go to dinner.

793
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,530
Yeah.
So Ms Dot lay in there.

794
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:51,364
And that was like daily.
I mean there were so many weird people 

795
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:55,630
in there.
We had this one girl,

796
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:57,790
Rosie,
her name was where she'd always grabbed.

797
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,560
She always ended up with a pair of sharp
scissors and lunch for someone's throat.

798
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,620
We're like,
where'd you get them?

799
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,580
Who's bringing her them scissors,
you know?

800
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,080
But anyway,
I went on an anti psychotic medicine and

801
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,933
um,
that was good that I was on there for 

802
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,374
the Shit I saw.
Now when you say any my friends hanging 

803
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:18,400
and stuff like that.
Sorry,

804
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:20,830
friends hanging in the mental 
institution.

805
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,090
So I saw worse than that.
Would you say hi?

806
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,060
I saw,
you know,

807
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,380
victims of abuse was terrible by the 
guards.

808
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,453
Know,
have kids coming in know victims of 

809
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:38,860
abuse that came in that were mentally 
scarred by that.

810
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

811
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,040
Now when they put you on anti 
psychotics,

812
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,440
was it because you were exhibiting 
psychotic behavior?

813
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:50,060
What kind of psychotic behavior?
While they thought it was psychotic high

814
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,853
was just scared that they.
I think I was throwing them off because 

815
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:54,850
I want to think.
I was like,

816
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,713
got it.
I didn't want to think them to think I 

817
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:58,174
was schizophrenia.
I knew enough not to let them near me 

818
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,650
that if [inaudible] once you got the,
uh,

819
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,680
once you got the diagnosis of 
schizophrenia they would just shocks and

820
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,300
they experiment on,
you're basically,

821
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,670
you're in Guinea pig and I didn't want 
that,

822
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,070
so maybe I,
you know,

823
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,540
and then you know,
so yeah,

824
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,374
I was doing weird things like walking 
down the middle of streets after I hit 

825
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,350
by the car,
I walked down the middle of the streets.

826
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:24,310
I don't know,
I thought,

827
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:25,144
Oh,
you got to get over your fear of 

828
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:28,360
crossing the streets.
That's what was in my head.

829
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,730
And then I'd walk down the highway,
you know,

830
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,943
I was in a whole other realm.
It was like a real surrealistic and 

831
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,940
metaphysical realm and I grew 
comfortable there.

832
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:41,774
But,
you know,

833
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,643
I think most artists,
writers and performers are in that 

834
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:46,610
world.
I mean,

835
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,480
we've got a toe in it,
at least I've gone in and out,

836
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,920
you know,
depending on,

837
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,083
you know,
now I think I'm on the right 

838
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,820
medications.
That helped me.

839
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,853
Um,
there's a lot of comedians that have 

840
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:00,850
similar stories,
you know,

841
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,340
some of the grades,
you know,

842
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:04,120
Kinison as a similar story to,
you know,

843
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,950
he was hit by a car and change changes 
personality radically.

844
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,490
And it happened in a similar age.
It happened when he was young as well.

845
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,760
And he was one person and then you get 
hit by a car.

846
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:16,410
And then after the car he was just wild 
man.

847
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,370
Wild didn't give a fuck.
Well,

848
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,400
totally impulsive,

849
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,360
but I didn't give a fuck it.
So I just thought different,

850
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,350
thought,
different.

851
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,430
I was just,
um,

852
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,990
I don't know,
my mom says when I was 18 months old,

853
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,360
I used to go out in the street and 
direct cars.

854
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,010
We lived on a highway and uh,
you know,

855
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,830
that,
uh,

856
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,990
she'd come and find me there just 18 
months.

857
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:39,940
All the holding up my hands,
Jesus Christ,

858
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:40,774
stop in traffic.
It's always had a weird thing going 

859
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,620
there.
But uh,

860
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,690
you know,
I don't know.

861
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,170
I think I watched too much of that 
police show,

862
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,540
you know,
where they'd stopped traffic.

863
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,220
I used to love TV shows and think they 
were real.

864
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,133
Some of it.
But how many people do you think know 

865
00:43:00,851 --> 00:43:05,440
this about your mental health history?
You know,

866
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,393
anybody who knows me,
I don't think very many people know 

867
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:09,070
what,
that we're angry you.

868
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,043
Oh yeah,
they did.

869
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,850
I don't think they did.
Yeah,

870
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:13,684
they did.
I don't think people look past the 

871
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:15,934
surface.
I think they looked at you as a rich 

872
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:21,250
white lady who said something that they 
considered to be racist and they decided

873
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:23,890
they were going to attack you.
And then the perception,

874
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:26,920
the optics of this is the reason why ABC
canceled the show.

875
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,450
The reason why was ABC,
right?

876
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

877
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,003
It's the reason why they canceled the 
show is the reason why everybody pulled 

878
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:33,274
back away from you.
And what did that feel like when nobody 

879
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:37,264
defended you?
People who should know you the way I 

880
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:42,820
know you and I defended you from the 
very beginning because I said,

881
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,480
look at my son told me I might.

882
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,070
Thank you.
This is not a racist person.

883
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,230
I go,
this is a woman who's kinda crazy.

884
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,150
He's brilliant.
Hilarious.

885
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,250
Fun To be around.
Yes.

886
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,170
It was one of the reasons why I love 
you.

887
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,161
Well,
you know,

888
00:43:57,161 --> 00:43:59,320
they try to outlaw comedy.
That's what I.

889
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,790
Well I was surprised that more comics 
didn't say nothing because you know,

890
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,200
they,
I don't know,

891
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,970
they're scared.
People are scared.

892
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:10,180
They're scared to support someone that 
they considered to be racist,

893
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,073
you know?
I mean,

894
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,430
I got a lot of shit from it,
but I don't give a fuck.

895
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,310
Yeah,
I didn't.

896
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,830
I didn't think what they want and call 
me what they want.

897
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:19,030
It don't change me.
It doesn't change you.

898
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,760
Well it just takes time before the dust 
settles.

899
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:24,870
And I knew that once I knew that once 
you and I talked,

900
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,980
if you and I sat down and talked like 
this,

901
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,170
people get a chance to see who you 
really are,

902
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,920
you know?
Well,

903
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,600
you know,
they might not like me,

904
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,060
I don't have to know.
They don't.

905
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,550
You're not a bad person,
you've never been a bad person.

906
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,423
I'm not a bad person,
but I've done bad things and like I was 

907
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:42,620
talking to,
uh,

908
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,160
you know,
I'm a name dropper.

909
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,800
I hate to drop his name out,
but forgive me,

910
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,970
I should have asked him first,
but you know,

911
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,260
I was talking to Mike Tyson,
you know,

912
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:59,290
and uh,
he's been through some stuff and uh,

913
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,010
you're like,
well,

914
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,210
the thing is you gotta you gotta become 
a pacifist.

915
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,250
That's,
that's your only.

916
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,280
Yeah.
Don't battle with people who don't know.

917
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,350
I can't battle with people back and 
forth online.

918
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:19,140
You know what I mean?
Um,

919
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:20,523
there's too many people,
there's not enough time and you'll go 

920
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:23,644
crazy.
You'll get wrapped up in conflict and 

921
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:28,240
you'll just be involved in it every 
minute of every day.

922
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,310
Yeah.
I call it feeding the beast.

923
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,430
Yeah.
Because that really is tower of Babel,

924
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,353
twitter.

925
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:35,441
Well,
it's,

926
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,274
it's definitely a strange,
strange environment where all these 

927
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:42,580
people are just,
they don't even know you.

928
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,443
They have no contact with you other than
your this person they could reach and 

929
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:47,254
get to react to certain lines and the 
more explosive and the more derogatory 

930
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:55,234
and insulting the lines they say to you,
the more impact it's gonna have on you 

931
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,250
so that flavors the way they communicate
with you.

932
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:01,540
Okay.

933
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,201
Yeah,
it was.

934
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:06,070
It was tough working with a lot of 
social justice warriors and remake.

935
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It was tough on me mentally.

936
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,060
So when you mean like the staff that you
were working

937
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,711
with?
Luck.

938
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:18,711
I was the only one saying I'm not a 
Republican.

939
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:19,883
Dora my fucking Democrat.
I'm an independent and I'm just 

940
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,230
anticorruption.
I'm just anticorruption don't,

941
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:33,510
don't make me into what your idea of who
I am.

942
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,770
What was that idea who you were and.
Well,

943
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,060
they thought that since I supported 
president trump or that I was,

944
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,840
you know,
a racist and a scumbag and you know,

945
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,720
anti everything just because I voted for
him.

946
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,100
Why did you support trump?

947
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:55,390
I love what Norm Macdonald said.
If I can quote him,

948
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,280
can I quote says it better than 
anything.

949
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,863
He said the American people.
I hated hillary so bad that they voted 

950
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:09,320
for a guy.
They hate it even worse.

951
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,760
Just don't rub it in.
That is normal Mcdonald.

952
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,080
That's brilliant.
But you know,

953
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,520
I wasn't,
I wasn't,

954
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,270
I wasn't for Hillary and I was a woman 
and that was like a big.

955
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:26,840
No,
no,

956
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,240
right.
That's Alec basically down to because it

957
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:33,100
was a woman's turn.
But,

958
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,910
you know,
I'm,

959
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:34,743
I,
I just want a government that works for 

960
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:38,220
the American people,
the Ta.

961
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,740
I pay taxes and I expect something for 
my taxes and,

962
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,470
you know,
here's news to all of them out there,

963
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:47,100
including poultice.
Uh,

964
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,550
I think at some time the American people
need to audit what happened to their tax

965
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,384
monies and I think we should all have a 
say in what this country does with our 

966
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,640
hard earned dollars.
And uh,

967
00:47:59,020 --> 00:47:59,853
don't just assume you speak for us 
because obviously you don't or we 

968
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:08,100
wouldn't have a trade deficit of 
$20,000,000,000,000.

969
00:48:08,101 --> 00:48:11,730
So stfu and,
uh,

970
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:16,300
let the American people handle what they
should handle in this country.

971
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:20,140
It's a republic and it's a runs on the,
uh,

972
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,500
on the consent of the governed.
And it's really,

973
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,300
really time to talk about that

974
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,653
now.
When you say social justice warriors 

975
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:29,144
that you had to work with specifically,
what were the issues that you were 

976
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:31,784
dealing with?

977
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,010
Well,
trump was the big elephant in the room.

978
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,310
My support for trump and they're just,
they're patronized.

979
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,970
Scheidt can I call it?
Yeah,

980
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:48,480
well we have to remember that the.
I mean I'm going to paraphrase,

981
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,010
but it was a lot.
Well,

982
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,873
you know,
the ignorant unwashed people who voted 

983
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,170
for trump,
it's not their fault.

984
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:00,710
That was Kinda what it was like.
And uh,

985
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,911
because I said,
well,

986
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:04,950
you know,
it was working class people that elected

987
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:05,950
trump.
So I,

988
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:07,343
I really can't,
I can't let you say that to me because 

989
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:12,590
it's not true,
you know,

990
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,940
they already had in their head what it 
means.

991
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,103
And of course they are wrong.
Like they're wrong about this being 

992
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,300
about,
you know,

993
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,910
the cabinet being about abortion rights 
or wrong about that too.

994
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,200
So,
you know,

995
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,530
they're wrong about that because I don't
think,

996
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,150
you know,
he said pretty much that,

997
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,013
you know,
you can't overturn something that's in 

998
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:38,180
law Roe versus Wade.
Yeah.

999
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,863
But you know,
they fear mongered to get everybody 

1000
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:45,150
thinking that's what they were after and
I don't think it is what they were.

1001
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,480
I don't think that is why they wanted 
to.

1002
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:50,010
I think they're concerned with anything 
that trump is trying to pass

1003
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,520
anyone that trump's trying to get to the
supreme court in any bills

1004
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,363
they should put on their adult pants and
get involved and make sure that he 

1005
00:50:01,591 --> 00:50:03,120
represents,
you know,

1006
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:03,954
the will of the people of this country.
You have to become involved in the 

1007
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:08,214
process then,
but don't just sit there on your butt 

1008
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,520
criticized and everybody and calling 
everybody names that,

1009
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,800
that's really not any kind of a justice 
warrior.

1010
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,430
That's all phony.
You got to get involved right

1011
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,433
now.
When you were first approached about 

1012
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:28,130
doing a Rosanne,
the relaunch,

1013
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,413
when they came to you,
how did this all take place and did you 

1014
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,840
get to pick the people that you work 
with?

1015
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Um,
I had already said about a year prior to

1016
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,640
that that I supported trump over 
hillary.

1017
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,050
And it was like,
you know,

1018
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:48,230
a big.
It was in all the papers in Hollywood,

1019
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:50,030
how,
how could she and,

1020
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,290
you know,
this and that and the other,

1021
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:56,630
but it didn't seem to bother the 
American people outside of my audience.

1022
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,500
Well,
you know,

1023
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,570
I always try to make content for the 
audience,

1024
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:01,350
not for the critics.
Right.

1025
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,610
And enough for the industry,
not for the industry.

1026
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:05,444
Now the industry is ruthlessly left,
like to the point where it's not even a 

1027
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:09,530
thinking thing.

1028
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,643
It's just like they automatically go 
left because that's the way you're 

1029
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,490
accepted in this town.
That's the way you stay working.

1030
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,920
That's the way you stay invited to all 
the time.

1031
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,640
That's the way that certain Stalinist 
types in show business.

1032
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:26,370
Keep it,
you know,

1033
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,550
uh,
you know,

1034
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:32,170
everything about the media is tightly 
controlled in Hollywood.

1035
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,020
So when they came,
who came to you with the relaunch?

1036
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,390
How did it,
how like how does it happen?

1037
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:38,224
That was an era where they did a sketch 
on Sarah's talk show and everyone liked 

1038
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:48,780
it.
And Sarah called me and said,

1039
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,550
she said,
John said he's in,

1040
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,770
if you,
you know,

1041
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,780
if you're in.
So you say Johnson of course is Lori.

1042
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,760
Yeah,
Lori's in.

1043
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,691
Okay.
Uh,

1044
00:52:00,691 --> 00:52:01,740
yeah,
let's do it.

1045
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,870
So what,
who turned on you after this was over

1046
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,860
while I'm my covenant of lawyers,
Advisors.

1047
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:14,100
I not get into this at this time.
That's,

1048
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,343
you know,
I think it's self explanatory where 

1049
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:18,200
people could find out.
Yeah,

1050
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:23,730
I don't know that they turned on me.
I think it was always that way since,

1051
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,360
you know,
I came in and said,

1052
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,613
I said no,
somebody on the show has to be a trump 

1053
00:52:28,631 --> 00:52:30,070
supporter.
None of them would do it.

1054
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,440
I'm like,
it's a great role.

1055
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,420
You know,
you could do it.

1056
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,510
You're the kind of person who wouldn't.
And they were like,

1057
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:41,950
no.
So I said,

1058
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:43,840
okay,
well then I'll do it because,

1059
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:45,390
you know,
I did vote for him.

1060
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,980
Every knows it.
Well people forget archie bunker.

1061
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,000
It's one of the greatest characters in 
the history of sitcoms.

1062
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,360
Nobody wants to be the quote unquote,
you know,

1063
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,340
other,
the bad person,

1064
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:02,290
the bad guy in Hollywood or you know,
be the other in Hollywood.

1065
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:03,603
But,
you know,

1066
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,050
I,
I was up for it.

1067
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,180
I thought it would be great.
I thought it would be,

1068
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,000
you know,
I get some lines in there from the other

1069
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:11,980
side once in awhile,
you know,

1070
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,320
I,
I let him say all they want to say.

1071
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:17,350
I never told them don't say that about 
him,

1072
00:53:17,351 --> 00:53:20,320
don't this and that,
like the day of the filming,

1073
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,910
you know,
I'd been saying,

1074
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:24,400
you know,
I let my writers do their Brighton,

1075
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:29,630
you know,
but I lay out all the stories or approve

1076
00:53:29,631 --> 00:53:30,464
them,
you know.

1077
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,150
And uh,
so

1078
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,860
it was that first show and I'm waiting 
for a line about hillary.

1079
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,670
I go,
I let you have seven trump jokes in this

1080
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:45,520
show.
And you came in one fucking Hillary.

1081
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:49,240
Joe Didn't want hilary joke.
Now what was the hilary joke?

1082
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:49,991
Do you remember?
I said,

1083
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:54,991
you better get me a hilary joke.
I did.

1084
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:57,610
I go,
it ain't about you,

1085
00:53:57,611 --> 00:53:59,890
your name and on this shit.
What did they say about it?

1086
00:53:59,891 --> 00:54:01,840
Like why did they not want to hilary 
joke?

1087
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,590
Did they have an explanation for it?
No,

1088
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:08,230
but everybody knew they wanted Hillary.
Yeah.

1089
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:09,723
They felt it would go against their 
morals to say that there's another way 

1090
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,184
to vote or to acknowledge that you know,
half the country voted that way or that 

1091
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:23,230
she's extremely flawed.
Well,

1092
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,050
that point they didn't care.
That's what's weird about it,

1093
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:26,943
isn't that the whole thing's weird.
There's a complete denial of reality 

1094
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,210
like this is not.

1095
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:33,880
There's nothing to do with women as 
nothing to do with liberals.

1096
00:54:33,881 --> 00:54:36,430
That is another.
You're talking about an extremely flawed

1097
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:37,790
person.
Well,

1098
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,753
I don't.
I'm not going to talk about her as a 

1099
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:40,654
person.
I just talk about her concepts and her 

1100
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:44,770
voting record.
Not even use the word person,

1101
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,723
politician.
Extremely flawed politician with a 

1102
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,620
background of deep corruption and lies.
Demonstratable lies like this.

1103
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:59,110
We're not talking about some amazing 
gem,

1104
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,140
you know.
Well,

1105
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,103
let's just put it like this.
A lot of us people who liked Bernie 

1106
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,890
voted for trump.
Yes.

1107
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,210
I'll put it like that.
Yeah.

1108
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,193
Well,
especially when they found out when 

1109
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:16,114
Donna Brazile's book came out and they 
found out what they had done to Bernie 

1110
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,800
during the primaries.
Yeah.

1111
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,070
It's dark shit.
Yeah.

1112
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,990
It's dark that,
that just everybody's like,

1113
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:27,880
whatever.
Whatever they said,

1114
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,850
nobody will vote for a Jew,
they'd use that one.

1115
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,020
It's hilarious in the cell to this day,
to this day,

1116
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:36,460
they're still doing stupid shit like 
that.

1117
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,630
But that,
you know,

1118
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,670
I didn't want her even though she is a 
woman,

1119
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:41,090
but you know,
uh,

1120
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,230
I did want her in 2008.
I wanted to her,

1121
00:55:44,231 --> 00:55:45,064
not Obama because I liked her healthcare
plan better at that time when I was 

1122
00:55:49,451 --> 00:55:50,284
still,
you know,

1123
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,950
before I walked away.
So,

1124
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,600
um,
you know,

1125
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:58,840
they're doing a whole march.
I might show up a march for what?

1126
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,680
Walk away,
walk away from what the Democrat Party,

1127
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,653
who is they,
who's doing this and a whole bunch of 

1128
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,530
kids,
youth.

1129
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:09,653
And what's the ID number?
Twenty seven that the cross from the 

1130
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,043
White House.
They're going to walk from the DNC to 

1131
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,204
that park there and make statements,
but walking away to wear to an 

1132
00:56:19,931 --> 00:56:22,710
independent party.
Terrian.

1133
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,370
They're going Republican,

1134
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,830
Republican.
That's what's bizarre.

1135
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:28,930
The polar opposites.
The right and the left,

1136
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:29,770
the blue and the red

1137
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,790
and all those guys golf together.
Let's get to cut through the bullshit.

1138
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,100
They're all making deals.
And scratching each other's back,

1139
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,340
whether from one party or the other.
Come on.

1140
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:40,050
Well,
trump

1141
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:43,260
paid Clinton to be at his wedding.
He did?

1142
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,460
Yeah.
Wow,

1143
00:56:44,461 --> 00:56:48,260
that's smart.
He got a photo op and a half out of that

1144
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:49,440
one.
I mean,

1145
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:52,160
he paid those people forever.
It's one of the reasons why when,

1146
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:52,994
when he was campaigning,
he had so much animosity towards them 

1147
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,210
and towards the system that he was a 
part of for so long.

1148
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,800
He was a democrat most of his life.

1149
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,340
I know.
Well,

1150
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:06,040
he's getting the.
He's getting it too.

1151
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:09,850
But uh,
that just proves it right there.

1152
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,510
You know,
they give money to both parties.

1153
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,560
You know,
in Hollywood,

1154
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:18,400
they don't just get to the Democrat 
party because the Republican Party to.

1155
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,650
But they stay silent about that.
Well,

1156
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,970
it's Kinda smart duck cover your at 
bats,

1157
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:23,823
you know,
which government contractor couldn't be 

1158
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:26,254
able to dip into.
And isn't that like what Hollywood is 

1159
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:30,220
really all about?

1160
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,920
Well,
there's so many levels to it,

1161
00:57:31,921 --> 00:57:32,850
right?
I mean,

1162
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:37,851
there's the blatant tribalism of right 
versus left where people pick a side and

1163
00:57:38,071 --> 00:57:42,690
they adopt a predetermined pattern or 
behavior and they adopt a conglomeration

1164
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:44,850
of ideas and the program.
Yes.

1165
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,080
Yeah.
And they're just bought.

1166
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,810
Exactly.
They pair it ever.

1167
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,330
And then below the surface he got geo 
political aspirations.

1168
00:57:51,331 --> 00:57:55,260
And you have the,
the global war machine.

1169
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

1170
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:56,640
Um,
that's,

1171
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,770
that's what you have the money,
the real money.

1172
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,720
But you know what Joe,
I always say when people call me a,

1173
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,780
a,
a whatever they call me,

1174
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,393
but I have optimism and I've said for a 
long time when the right people are at 

1175
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:11,734
the controls of all the machinery and 
technology that will be so great for 

1176
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:18,760
humanity.
We have the right within our grasp to,

1177
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,953
you know,
make sure that this is a good place for 

1178
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:23,650
all kids.
We could do that tomorrow.

1179
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,813
So I think we should start thinking 
about that and all this artificial 

1180
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:30,160
intelligence that gets us fighting with 
each other.

1181
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,770
Let's just step out of it like the 
Matrix,

1182
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:33,604
you know,
let's go to a new place where we're 

1183
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:35,164
about solutions and working together and
bringing this country together and 

1184
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:41,200
getting some real good jobs,
real good health care.

1185
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,960
Things that we pay taxes for better 
streets,

1186
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:46,990
good education.
The things we pay taxes for.

1187
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,540
Yeah.
And mental health.

1188
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,403
Most of all,
I think that's what we need to protect 

1189
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,340
for our veterans.
They come back and they're,

1190
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,040
they're untreated and they won't even 
give him marijuana,

1191
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:00,100
which really helps.
They weren't even legalized that for,

1192
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:00,963
you know,
people who have pts and marijuana does 

1193
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:05,790
help with pts and uh,
you know,

1194
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,550
you know,
talk about supporting our troops.

1195
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,220
Twenty two of them a day are killing 
themselves.

1196
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:14,120
They're homeless.
I mean that,

1197
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,840
that's who we are.
I don't want that to be who we are.

1198
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,063
Come on.
They'd people think nobody can see us 

1199
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:23,440
and we do,
but they do and they,

1200
00:59:23,441 --> 00:59:24,500
they want it,
right?

1201
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,393
People want things to be right in work 
and used for the good of all people and 

1202
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,040
stop tearing people apart from each 
other.

1203
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,330
We're neighbors,
you know,

1204
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:33,164
that was why I wanted to go back to the 
Roseanne show and say all those things 

1205
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:37,520
and I'm so happy that I did.

1206
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,590
I did it in nine episodes,
I wonder,

1207
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:40,424
10th season and I did all nine episodes 
where exactly the episodes I wanted to 

1208
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:45,254
do,
so,

1209
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,133
uh,
and it was number one every week and I 

1210
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:50,330
just thank my fans for that,
you know,

1211
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,850
a,
a turn of fortune.

1212
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:57,080
But um,
I did what I wanted to do and uh,

1213
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,273
and it was so gratifying.
It's so wonderful and I don't want that 

1214
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:02,804
to be forgotten.
I don't want the ninth season to 

1215
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,650
disappear.
I'm in the 10th season to disappear.

1216
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,290
What do you think about them doing it 
without you?

1217
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:14,120
How fucking weird is that?
It is weird.

1218
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,320
I'm like,
oh,

1219
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,154
I get it.
They're sending me a subtle message to 

1220
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:19,220
ode on opioids.

1221
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:21,960
You.
No,

1222
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,070
that sounds that.
Where you think.

1223
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,490
Yeah,
that's some of it mind control stuff.

1224
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,333
Yeah.
So you think that they want you to kill 

1225
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:30,510
yourself?
Well,

1226
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:32,610
I don't know why they would do what they
did.

1227
01:00:32,611 --> 01:00:34,680
Let's put it that way.
Doesn't make any sense.

1228
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:35,514
I just,
I just think they're being completely 

1229
01:00:36,751 --> 01:00:38,850
inconsiderate and they don't care about,
you know,

1230
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:43,851
they don't and they,
they so belittled my contribution to the

1231
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:46,620
show too.
It just was shocking.

1232
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,080
That was the most painful part of the 
whole thing.

1233
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:53,520
But one of the things that I read was 
that you hadn't considered the more than

1234
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:56,310
100 people that work on the show when 
you did what you did.

1235
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,330
And I'm like,
that is,

1236
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,850
that's a ridiculous statement.
I didn't cancel the show.

1237
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:03,600
Not only did you not cancel the show,
you were on ambien drunk tweeting.

1238
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:04,623
Did the idea that you did this,
this was some sort of a deliberate ploy 

1239
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,453
to get the show canceled or the idea 
that there was any justification that's 

1240
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:13,200
just shows should be canceled at all.

1241
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,960
Like what?
You can't just say something that you,

1242
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,560
you didn't want to come out that way and
apologize for it.

1243
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,810
You guys,
I apologize.

1244
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,960
Apologize for three months.
No.

1245
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,350
Yeah,
they don't know who you are now.

1246
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:28,540
They tried to wipe me off the,
uh,

1247
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:29,723
off the map of the culture because 
people are scared to be connected with 

1248
01:01:34,231 --> 01:01:36,780
anybody who's a target and they acted 
like cowards.

1249
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,000
I wouldn't have done.
I mean,

1250
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:39,834
if it were my friend,
definitely I would have years of two 

1251
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:44,394
decades or more,
I would have said something and I 

1252
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:50,570
definitely,
one thing I would never have done is,

1253
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,493
um,
stab somebody in the rush to condemn 

1254
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:57,290
somebody who,
you know,

1255
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,770
was my biggest,

1256
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,480
uh,
advocate.

1257
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:03,920
Well,
there was a lot of,

1258
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,520
sometimes an only advocate.
There was a lot of that.

1259
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:11,020
I saw a lot of that about them.
It's just about them.

1260
01:02:11,021 --> 01:02:14,230
It's not about me.
I just let go of all of it because,

1261
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,210
you know,
I,

1262
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,070
I try,
I,

1263
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,933
I am a person of belief and I just 
always try to do what's right in front 

1264
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,640
of me.
I feel like what,

1265
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:24,810
uh,
you know,

1266
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,120
my higher intelligence plays in front of
me.

1267
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:30,810
I'll do it and [inaudible] it knows 
better than me and um,

1268
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,870
which is why I don't think like other 
people.

1269
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,513
But,
um,

1270
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,420
and also that,
um,

1271
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,850
I,
I was not going to fight not at 66.

1272
01:02:41,851 --> 01:02:42,850
I'm too old.
I,

1273
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,210
I'm pretty frail and I think,
you know,

1274
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:48,900
I worked really hard to get a second 
season and it's kind of ironic.

1275
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:53,550
I crossed time-zones to do promotion for
free for months.

1276
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,990
And uh,
you know,

1277
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:55,824
during that time when you're old and you
can't sleep and you're crossing time 

1278
01:02:58,921 --> 01:02:59,754
zones,
going from Hawaii to New York and back 

1279
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:04,860
and then back again and back again,
you know,

1280
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,290
uh,
you know,

1281
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,940
I kind of became dependent on Ambien and
I,

1282
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,980
you know,
almost every night took it.

1283
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,533
And uh,

1284
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:20,860
you know,
obviously I,

1285
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,100
something was wrong because I,
I didn't think,

1286
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:29,340
I thought that tweet was about a science
fiction movie,

1287
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,533
which happens to be my favorite movie.
And which I think is a very apt in the 

1288
01:03:36,971 --> 01:03:38,950
world today,
particularly in Iran,

1289
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,280
were just a small group of corrupt 
leaders are oppressing the citizens.

1290
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,833
And,
uh,

1291
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,573
I think it,
I think there's a lot of references in 

1292
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:56,330
that movie that,
uh,

1293
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,980
go along with what's happening in Iran,
uh,

1294
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:01,973
of the human beings rising up to throw 
over there to over throw their 

1295
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:05,604
overlords.
And that's how I was looking at the 

1296
01:04:07,651 --> 01:04:09,810
whole thing.
So when I woke up to tweet there,

1297
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:14,100
that was what was in my head.
It was certainly not somebody looks and,

1298
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:14,620
uh,
uh,

1299
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:18,990
it was also about the Arab spring in 
Egypt,

1300
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,190
which,
which,

1301
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,113
uh,
you know,

1302
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,200
uh,
Obama,

1303
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,370
he didn't handle it right.
And,

1304
01:04:28,371 --> 01:04:29,204
uh,
so all those things are interrelated 

1305
01:04:30,261 --> 01:04:33,470
with Iran and the Iran deal,
the Iran nuclear deal.

1306
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:34,580
You know,
I'm,

1307
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:39,580
I'm extremely well read on that subject.
I certainly wouldn't be at the height of

1308
01:04:42,051 --> 01:04:43,880
my power and my fame

1309
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:48,370
being on there going command key.
Excuse me.

1310
01:04:48,371 --> 01:04:50,230
I'm not an idiot.
Okay.

1311
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,000
I won't be on the key.

1312
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:54,623
I'm a well read and intelligent woman in
my word and things that I write to 

1313
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:02,370
people over in that part of the world 
there.

1314
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:04,943
I've brought a lot of people together in
that part of the world with my tweets 

1315
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:12,150
and most of my tweets are spiritual in 
nature anyway.

1316
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,660
So,
uh,

1317
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:18,550
it wasn't what people thought it was and
still,

1318
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,443
I apologize for.
I'm inadvertently hurting anyone's 

1319
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:28,210
feelings still.
I apologize for inadvertently and not,

1320
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,133
you know,
I apologize that they were wrong and 

1321
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:34,720
they misheard it and misunderstood it,
but that wasn't good enough either.

1322
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:36,400
And you know,
just get to a point where I go,

1323
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,390
I'm letting go of it,
uh,

1324
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,333
my fans who know me and my family and 
people who like me and know me for my 

1325
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:44,914
life,
they know who I am and that's all that 

1326
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:47,640
matters.
You know,

1327
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:48,483
they can call me whatever they want.
I don't accept their definition of that 

1328
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:54,760
word.
And I think that they should read more.

1329
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:56,773
Well,
one of the things that's most shocking 

1330
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,940
about this outrage culture that we live 
in right now,

1331
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,170
this age of outrage is that there is no 
path to redemption.

1332
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:11,800
There's,
there's no acceptance of these.

1333
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,530
There is though,
be a,

1334
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,260
but there's not from the general public.

1335
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:16,800
Oh yeah,
the public.

1336
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,120
Everywhere I went,
people run up to me.

1337
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:22,210
I never felt so much love in my entire 
career,

1338
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:25,750
in real life,
but not on twitter and I'm not on social

1339
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:26,380
media,

1340
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,130
not on social media,
social media.

1341
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,243
It magnifies the very worst aspects of 
humanity because you're not interacting 

1342
01:06:33,381 --> 01:06:38,270
with people in the real flesh.
You're not experiencing social cues.

1343
01:06:38,271 --> 01:06:41,000
You're not looking them in the eye,
you're not seeing them as a person.

1344
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,070
You're just seeing them as a target 
online.

1345
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,910
Well,
I think that twitter has,

1346
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:48,190
is a purposeful plan.
Uh,

1347
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,193
like facebook.
I got off facebook years ago because I 

1348
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:52,134
realized what they were doing,
what I think twitter is doing and doing 

1349
01:06:55,231 --> 01:06:57,120
the same thing that facebook did.
How,

1350
01:06:57,121 --> 01:07:01,440
so it's manufacturing consent and you 
know,

1351
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,430
it's using bots to do it by 
manufacturing consent.

1352
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,580
It's a place where like Noam Chomsky 
says,

1353
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:11,370
you know,
the press manufacturers consent,

1354
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,443
that consent of the governed.
So that's what they're doing is 

1355
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:18,150
manufacturing the consent of the 
governed,

1356
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,283
but they also manufactured descent.
They control the opposition to on 

1357
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:25,350
twitter.
And I liked getting in between those two

1358
01:07:25,351 --> 01:07:29,850
and causing a Ruckus because I knew it 
was all artificial intelligence anyway.

1359
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,043
It's all just a track us,
we all know that just like they do in 

1360
01:07:33,661 --> 01:07:34,494
China.

1361
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:36,813
So what are you saying?
You think there's some sort of a grand 

1362
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,110
plan to get people to argue with each 
other?

1363
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,410
Yeah,
I think it's a social experiment to turn

1364
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:46,570
one group against another,
which,

1365
01:07:46,571 --> 01:07:47,404
you know,
it's smart because it's divide and 

1366
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:50,890
conquer.
And as long as we're like,

1367
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:52,780
you know,
it's all these people getting robbed.

1368
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:53,614
All these taxpayers getting robbed,
sitting there pointing to other tax 

1369
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:59,110
payers.
They're getting robbed and blaming them.

1370
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:00,933
But nobody.
Everybody needs to look upward of our 

1371
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:03,604
government asked for an audit of our 
taxes and actually take responsibility 

1372
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:09,970
for the things that our country does.
We're getting judged for it anyway.

1373
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,620
I think we allowed.

1374
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:16,430
I think there's certainly people that 
are capitalizing on all this chaos

1375
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,280
and uh,
all the,

1376
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,333
all the conflict.
But I don't think it's manufactured and 

1377
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:23,360
I don't think it's engineered.
I just think it's happening because this

1378
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:24,830
is a new thing,
this,

1379
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:26,740
this ability to interact with each 
other.

1380
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,670
I think people have a mind of their own 
and people are inherently tribal.

1381
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:35,450
There's almost no way to stop them from 
being tribal tribes or tribal,

1382
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:36,913
but the problem with tribalism is easy 
sometimes have enemies that are 

1383
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:44,051
unnecessary,
so you develop this common ground,

1384
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:49,040
but that would be nice if we all looked 
at ourselves as a tribal world.

1385
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,083
That's how I do look at the world and 
why I didn't want Hillary Clinton 

1386
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:53,624
because her party is very much for 
corporate law and the Republican Party 

1387
01:08:58,401 --> 01:08:59,234
is very much for tribal law and I am a 
tribal person and I think tribal people 

1388
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:05,470
should,
you know,

1389
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,610
have their land.
Tribal.

1390
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:10,220
In what way?
How he tribal me?

1391
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,220
Yeah.
Well I'm Jewish.

1392
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:21,040
When I go over there to the Middle East,
I visit the graves of my teachers.

1393
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,013
That's how I'm tribal.
I go to their graves and that's what we 

1394
01:09:27,051 --> 01:09:30,050
do.
That's what all indigenous people do.

1395
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:31,183
They want to control their sacred burial
grounds and that is anti corporate law 

1396
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:38,990
and that's why I'm anti corporate law.
I can't.

1397
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:44,320
I like to study paypal bowls and 
corporate law and a maritime law and all

1398
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:46,190
that kind of stuff.
You know,

1399
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:49,970
I like to read so I have a lot of 
information and you know,

1400
01:09:49,971 --> 01:09:54,971
it makes me angry or sad is that that 
the work of an artist over 30 years,

1401
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,003
you think they think that we just pull 
that out of their ass and that they can 

1402
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:01,910
copy it,
you know,

1403
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:05,000
without the artists,
they can copy it.

1404
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,680
You mean your show?
I do.

1405
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,160
Yeah.
And it,

1406
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,050
it,
it is.

1407
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,173
You know,
all the stuff I suffered in my life I 

1408
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:13,670
put into that show.

1409
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:17,510
That show is about my family,
my children,

1410
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,790
and it's just like,
wow,

1411
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:22,850
this is so huge.
It's so huge.

1412
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:24,890
It's,
it's beyond entitled,

1413
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,390
but what are they going to,
what is their plan and how are they able

1414
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,450
to do that?
Did you let them signed off?

1415
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:37,900
He asked me to sign off because I felt 
like I would be a huge hypocrite too.

1416
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:40,214
Have talked 30 years or more in my life 
about labor rights and the rights of 

1417
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:49,640
working people if I took away those p 
200 people's jobs.

1418
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,130
So that's why I did it.
I wanted them to work.

1419
01:10:52,131 --> 01:10:52,964
I know how they had planned on another 
season and they probably had already 

1420
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:58,334
spent the money.
Was there any consideration of 

1421
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:00,974
redemption?
Was there any path where they can allow 

1422
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:03,914
you to apologize or do something that 
would endear yourself to the people 

1423
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:10,400
where they heard that?
I said,

1424
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,200
let me go on all your,
uh,

1425
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,093
abc us and explained my tweet and how it
was a political and not a racial tweet 

1426
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,800
and um,
you know,

1427
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:20,634
that was denied me.
It's like you can't say anything until 

1428
01:11:24,801 --> 01:11:25,634
you sign off.
You can't say anything until you sign 

1429
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:28,784
off.
So they wanted you to sign off the 

1430
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:31,910
rights and then they would have you do 
whatever you want to do.

1431
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:34,420
Go on their interview shows.
They didn't guarantee that,

1432
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,413
didn't guarantee that.
So they just wanted you to sign off and 

1433
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:40,880
they offered you nothing in return.
They offered me some money,

1434
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,960
but the idea was just to be able to Redo
the show.

1435
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,353
Yeah,
to take all those years of my ideas and 

1436
01:11:48,321 --> 01:11:52,160
how I thought of 20 years of those 
situations to come back.

1437
01:11:52,161 --> 01:11:55,370
It took me 20 years to figure out how 
would these characters,

1438
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:56,263
where would they be now?
And I did that by living among regular 

1439
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,470
normal people for 20 years.
I never lived behind a,

1440
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:04,363
you know,
a racially segregated gates like other 

1441
01:12:08,721 --> 01:12:09,554
stars.
I lived in working people's 

1442
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:12,794
neighborhoods and I farm around farmers 
and I wasn't going to be that big of a 

1443
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:18,710
hypocrite.
Macadamia nut farm.

1444
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:20,450
I sure do.
It's gorgeous.

1445
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,080
You should come and see it.
I love the Big Island.

1446
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,080
Isn't it gorgeous?
Amazing.

1447
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,770
People are dumb.
They're though today.

1448
01:12:27,771 --> 01:12:32,771
You know what I read from people.
Some lady took a boat full of people too

1449
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:33,974
close to the volcano to look at it and 
the lava over took their boat and thank 

1450
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:38,810
God.

1451
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:42,500
Now I'm were killed,
but they were got like about two feet up

1452
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:44,490
on the.
Oh Jesus.

1453
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:47,030
So don't do that.
Hawaiians don't do that.

1454
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:48,303
Somebody got hit with there.
That's probably why it's pretty good 

1455
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:52,004
weed.
Yeah.

1456
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:54,660
They got hit by a flying chunk of rock 
from the volcano on.

1457
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:55,700
Um,
one of the boats too.

1458
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,760
They were having lava tourism and 
someone gets hit by a rock.

1459
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,360
It's so not smart.
It's so stupid.

1460
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:05,540
It's a dangerous,
dangerous situations.

1461
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:07,580
Shouldn't be.
Don't go on those tours.

1462
01:13:07,581 --> 01:13:09,980
Your area safe.
Uh,

1463
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,900
my,
my area flooded a bed.

1464
01:13:11,901 --> 01:13:15,860
I had to replace my roads for about the 
10th time in 10 years.

1465
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,970
I always got to replace my roads.
I really got into making roads.

1466
01:13:19,971 --> 01:13:21,620
That's one thing that I really did 
enjoy.

1467
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,680
So I'll be headed back there and be 
making more roads.

1468
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:28,310
I'm excited about it.
I can cut a road like nobody's business.

1469
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,860
I'm a hell of.
I wanted to write a book.

1470
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:36,050
My granny is a scout and a [inaudible].
I do scout the jungle,

1471
01:13:36,051 --> 01:13:37,460
you know,
and make a road in there.

1472
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,660
I love the attitude of people that live 
in the big island.

1473
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,760
It's a very relaxed,
laid back,

1474
01:13:43,761 --> 01:13:45,380
friendly attitude.
The,

1475
01:13:45,381 --> 01:13:47,120
they just have all the time in the 
world.

1476
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:49,640
It's a different sort of vibe when you 
go there.

1477
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:51,470
Yeah,
everybody helps their neighbors,

1478
01:13:51,471 --> 01:13:52,304
their,
they don't like turn them in where 

1479
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,700
everybody helps out their neighbors and 
their neighbors are like every,

1480
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,700
every kind of people you can think of 
it.

1481
01:14:01,701 --> 01:14:02,570
It's very,
uh,

1482
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,980
a very,
um,

1483
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:08,400
diverse cultural.
How'd you wind up Medicare?

1484
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,470
Well,
I went there because my son Buck I had,

1485
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,423
I made him go to the school out there.
So then I bought a place right by the d 

1486
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:19,150
school because this kid,
you know,

1487
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,990
he had feel he's 23 now so he probably 
won't get mad,

1488
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:27,991
but he had some severe adhd there,
so I had to do what I did to get him.

1489
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:34,120
Now he just graduated from college.
He's doing real good.

1490
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:37,600
Yeah,
he is my first college Grad.

1491
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,800
[inaudible] all right.

1492
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,650
Adhd.
Maybe he's a comic.

1493
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,970
Yeah.
He's so funny.

1494
01:14:43,971 --> 01:14:46,340
Oh my God,
he's so hilarious.

1495
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:48,640
Maybe he's a comic to sweet,
so.

1496
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:51,140
Sure it's,
my grandkids are too.

1497
01:14:51,141 --> 01:14:56,141
They're all video that you show me.
They're all hilarious.

1498
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:58,250
Yeah,
they seemed very funny.

1499
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,880
Oh,
what are they gonna do to your character

1500
01:15:01,881 --> 01:15:03,170
on the show?
Uh,

1501
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,360
they're gonna kill you off.
Yeah,

1502
01:15:05,361 --> 01:15:08,100
I think they did.
They didn't tell you some of.

1503
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,120
I know they didn't tell me.
How weird is it?

1504
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,500
Some of my spies told me.
How weird is it?

1505
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:17,530
They're taking you out of Roseanne.
They're calling it the connors.

1506
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:19,670
It's all going on without you being 
there.

1507
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:22,050
What does that feel like?

1508
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:27,250
Um,
it's a mind warp and a mind fuck,

1509
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,850
you know.
So I'm just trying to go from a tweet.

1510
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,640
Yeah,
a miss.

1511
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,750
Understood.
Tweet,

1512
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:36,643
misunderstood.
Tweet while you're on ambien while 

1513
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:42,910
you're drunk.
Drunk only had like one or two beers.

1514
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,093
Well,
when you have one or two beers with 

1515
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:46,210
ambien.
Yeah,

1516
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:48,400
I guess you're drunk.
You're fucked up.

1517
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:49,383
I was,
yeah.

1518
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,520
I wasn't in smoking pot too,
right?

1519
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,830
No,
I don't think I'd smoke pot then.

1520
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,800
No,
I didn't smoke pot then

1521
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:03,380
I was at my mom's house on the.
So I went down in the basement.

1522
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:05,034
I was hiding down there in the basement 
because they were surrounded my mom's 

1523
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:09,240
house,
Papa razzies and search.

1524
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:10,463
And so as a down in the basement.
And that's where I always used to go 

1525
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:17,460
when I was 13 and I found this stuff and
chalk on the,

1526
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:21,390
on the walls of the basement there that 
I remembered right when I was 13.

1527
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:22,943
And then I found an old.
But from one I snuck segues when I was 

1528
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:27,920
13.
Smoking.

1529
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,280
Oh hell yeah.
It smell good.

1530
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:30,723
No,
I'm kidding.

1531
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,513
But I was hiding down there smoking.
They were knocking on my mom's door and 

1532
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:39,900
I was like,
oh my God.

1533
01:16:39,901 --> 01:16:42,900
So my boyfriend got the door.
He's like a big man,

1534
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:43,734
you know,
he's like,

1535
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:45,800
may I help,
you know,

1536
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,860
that's my man character.
And uh,

1537
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,020
I thought they were gonna,
you know,

1538
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:53,190
say something.
And they're like,

1539
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:57,390
we just please tell Roseanne we love her
and you know,

1540
01:16:57,391 --> 01:17:01,740
we don't like this and Blah Blah.
And that was happening all the time.

1541
01:17:01,741 --> 01:17:03,810
And that's when I was like,
Geez,

1542
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:09,470
I've never ever felt this kind of 
affection

1543
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:15,130
from people in all my career.
So it's kind of a cool.

1544
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,570
That's,
that's the thing,

1545
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,433
there's the social media outrage and 
then there's people in real life that 

1546
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:24,440
feel terrible for you because they feel 
like you got a raw deal.

1547
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:26,610
Yeah.
They think that there's doubt there.

1548
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:31,780
There are so many double standards of 
people who said things on the air.

1549
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:35,300
Remember I just said it to a small 
population,

1550
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:37,730
less than 600,000
people on twitter,

1551
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:41,600
but these people say things on the air 
and they are not.

1552
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:42,853
Well,
I know joy had to call pants and 

1553
01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:46,130
apologize.
So yeah.

1554
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:48,530
What a joy bay say about pence.
It was so bad.

1555
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:49,423
She something about his Christian faith 
that they're psychotic or something 

1556
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:55,000
because they.
So she'd call us.

1557
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,510
Yeah,
that's what I heard,

1558
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,633
you know,
an apology with your network behind you 

1559
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:03,080
really works.
Like with,

1560
01:18:03,081 --> 01:18:05,290
what's her name that called Ivanka?

1561
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:06,770
The names.
I can't remember.

1562
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,693
Samantha and her network was behind her 
and that was far more offensive and it 

1563
01:18:11,901 --> 01:18:12,734
was on the air and uh,
but when your network is not behind you 

1564
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:21,660
that you don't really know they were.
They didn't want me to tweet the whole.

1565
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,863
The whole truth is I,
I told him I wasn't going to tweet and 

1566
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:27,794
you know,
I promised him over and over and 

1567
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:33,710
although they never send it in writing,
which was required,

1568
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:36,920
but anyway,
they called my publicist and unloaded on

1569
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,860
him all the time.
Can,

1570
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,490
you know,
I should've stayed up twitter.

1571
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:43,120
I did it to myself and uh,
you know,

1572
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:46,880
I made a mistake and,
and the ball kept rolling,

1573
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:47,893
put.
It's just crazy that this what I think 

1574
01:18:49,611 --> 01:18:50,444
is insignificant mistake,
especially in light of your apology 

1575
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,390
could lead to no redemption possible.
Yeah.

1576
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:58,130
Didn't no redemption possible.

1577
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:01,130
That this giant fucking hit show.
And I look,

1578
01:19:01,131 --> 01:19:02,900
I don't know what's going to happen with
the connors,

1579
01:19:02,901 --> 01:19:06,860
but I think it's going to fail.
Asked me if I had some money to bet if I

1580
01:19:06,861 --> 01:19:09,410
was in vegas because that shit ain't 
gonna work.

1581
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:10,370
How's it?
Good.

1582
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:12,050
How Are you going to do Rosanna without 
Roseanne?

1583
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,753
If you wanted to have a whole new sitcom
with all those people with a totally 

1584
01:19:15,861 --> 01:19:17,990
unrelated storyline,
that's one thing,

1585
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:21,080
but you don't think America is going to 
know that they killed you off.

1586
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,393
Like what the fuck is that and that and 
now with time and consideration after 

1587
01:19:26,781 --> 01:19:29,390
time has passed and people can review 
everything,

1588
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:30,523
they're going to go was really this bad 
and they're going to think about their 

1589
01:19:32,691 --> 01:19:34,310
own lives.
Like what about me?

1590
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,800
What if I say something fucked up just 
fucking around.

1591
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,953
I take ambien and accidentally say 
something crazy and don't even remember 

1592
01:19:40,731 --> 01:19:44,630
saying it and then it's misconstrued or 
it comes out wrong.

1593
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,793
Is it going to ruin my whole life?
Like how can you have someone ruined 

1594
01:19:48,141 --> 01:19:53,141
their whole life for something that is 
misconstrued teen also a in a rally.

1595
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,510
I mean that's why I think first of all 
us women,

1596
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:04,511
we need to do a better job of raising 
our sons and a bet at 17.

1597
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:07,590
Everyone's out of their frigging mind.
I have five kids.

1598
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,470
There's not a one of them who didn't do 
something horrendous at eight,

1599
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,080
17.
What?

1600
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:16,380
We were just talking about that with 
Andrew Santina who was in here earlier.

1601
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,970
That yeah.
When when young men,

1602
01:20:17,971 --> 01:20:18,804
especially young men that don't get a 
birds and the bees speech and who knows 

1603
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,050
what the fuck is going on in their home,
you know,

1604
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,290
people do stupid shit.

1605
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,270
Yeah.
My son that went to college,

1606
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:30,630
but he says he learned the day he 
started college.

1607
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:34,320
They gave out this pamphlet on sexual 
assault to all the boys.

1608
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,513
I guess I gave it to the girls too,
but he said he read it and he realized 

1609
01:20:38,461 --> 01:20:42,990
it was any kind of sexuality at all is 
don't even do it.

1610
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:44,580
And I,
I told both.

1611
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:46,040
My sons,
do you got to get you.

1612
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:47,670
If you're going to have sex with 
somebody,

1613
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:48,504
you make them sign a consent form and 
have take it to their lawyer and get it 

1614
01:20:53,191 --> 01:20:56,880
properly notarized and then make a date 
for after that happened.

1615
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,360
Live in this dangerous time for our sons
and our daughters.

1616
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,353
Well,
it's always a dangerous time for women 

1617
01:21:02,831 --> 01:21:04,960
right in with the wrong man.

1618
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,970
Well,
or the wrong woman.

1619
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:10,240
Are you shitting me?
Women are just as horrible as man.

1620
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,670
I'm terrible with women to this one.

1621
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:16,740
Cool assault and rape,
uh,

1622
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:18,310
amongst lesbian couples.
It's,

1623
01:21:18,311 --> 01:21:19,144
it's pretty bad,

1624
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:22,300
but I mean,
what about rape in the prisons?

1625
01:21:22,301 --> 01:21:23,620
I mean,
nobody talks about that.

1626
01:21:23,621 --> 01:21:24,454
That's,
that's the real rape culture where men 

1627
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:27,730
are learning,
you know,

1628
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:29,710
it's terrible.

1629
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:30,560
Well,
yeah.

1630
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,393
Well we can get into depth about how bad
prisons are in general and how people 

1631
01:21:34,101 --> 01:21:34,540
aren't reading.

1632
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:37,200
You ever watch orange is the new block,
so I know.

1633
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,270
I've never seen it.
It's great.

1634
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,830
Oh my God,
it's great.

1635
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,470
But the problem with,
you know,

1636
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,200
there's no rehabilitation.
I mean it's,

1637
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:47,370
it's very rare looseness in,
in prisons.

1638
01:21:47,371 --> 01:21:51,040
What you're doing is you take people and
you make them better criminals or make a

1639
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:53,820
more hardened criminals.
You surrounded with other criminals.

1640
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:54,900
You give them a horrible work,

1641
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,743
Lord,
living further because most prisoners 

1642
01:21:58,261 --> 01:22:00,210
are in their because they're abused 
children.

1643
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:01,103
Well,
and what percentage of prisoners are in 

1644
01:22:01,831 --> 01:22:05,550
there for nonviolent drug offenses just 
drives me crazy.

1645
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:07,360
Fucking insane.
When I ran for president,

1646
01:22:07,361 --> 01:22:10,920
I ran on legalization of marijuana for 
that exact reason.

1647
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,420
Well,
slowly but surely.

1648
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:14,700
That's becoming a mainstream idea.
I'm glad.

1649
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:15,920
Glad to.
I mean,

1650
01:22:15,921 --> 01:22:20,180
as a rabid pot user,
I love it.

1651
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,770
No,
I think marijuana is,

1652
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:25,400
it makes you more sensitive,
aware person.

1653
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:26,263
It definitely makes you paranoid,
but I think that paranoia allows you to 

1654
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:33,650
understand all the danger in the world 
that you probably ignoring.

1655
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,910
Yeah.
One more time,

1656
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,970
like I was with March,
you know,

1657
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,920
uh,
once I started smoking pot,

1658
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:42,100
then I got real paranoid of people and 
that was a good thing.

1659
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:45,340
You shouldn't be paranoid of.
People should be aware of for sure.

1660
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:48,310
Particularly if you watch cable TV for 
crisis,

1661
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:50,440
that ID channel.

1662
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,410
What are you doing now?
Like what are you going to do now?

1663
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:56,330
You were saying that you have some other
things cooking.

1664
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,650
You know,
I got 20,000

1665
01:23:02,651 --> 01:23:04,690
ideas a day.
Why don't you do something like this?

1666
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,300
I got a focus into something.
Why don't you do this?

1667
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:10,180
Which something like this.
So easy.

1668
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,020
So you said You'd help me?
I just can't.

1669
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,760
I don't know how to write it in a 
fucking password.

1670
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,510
Turn this shit on.
Listen,

1671
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:20,344
you don't need that.
We can get you connected to someone who 

1672
01:23:21,941 --> 01:23:23,590
can do that for you.
That shit's easy.

1673
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:24,483
I'd like to talk to other people who've 
fallen from grace and see how they get 

1674
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:29,080
back up,
but the,

1675
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,530
the real truth of it is that there is 
redemption,

1676
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:33,573
there is and there,
there's moving on and there's like 

1677
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,500
stopping the fight and there's like,
you know,

1678
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:43,510
for me it was a while.
I realized they're not my family.

1679
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:48,100
My real family is,
you know,

1680
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,660
a joy to me.
And uh,

1681
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:56,450
I got a great real family.
I raised two good sons and uh,

1682
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,213
you know,
of course I want them protected from 

1683
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:03,760
crazy women for crying out loud.
I,

1684
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:08,890
I over modulate their dating lives.
I do filter them.

1685
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,570
Yeah.
You have two.

1686
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,090
How old are your sons?
Once 40.

1687
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,620
Try to filter my dating life would be 
like,

1688
01:24:17,621 --> 01:24:18,790
mom,
I love you.

1689
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,380
Yeah,
shut the fuck up.

1690
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:24,070
That's because your mom ain't me.
That's true.

1691
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,300
Because I go,
no,

1692
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:26,081
this is,
you know,

1693
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:28,820
we can't have no bitches up in,
can't.

1694
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:32,650
I can't take no second class picks 
telling me I'm beneath her.

1695
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:37,030
That's why I helped break up my son's 
marriage because she way she treated me.

1696
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,680
You had someone who's disrespecting,
you know,

1697
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:43,990
you're never gonna fucking well that and
all my daughters,

1698
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:47,260
thank God all their sons,
they listened to me.

1699
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,530
They do what I tell them,
so it's great.

1700
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:56,000
So I have good son in laws.
That's good.

1701
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:57,121
The One?
No,

1702
01:24:57,121 --> 01:24:59,580
he's a problem.
He's from Russia.

1703
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:03,820
He's Russian.
And on his wedding night,

1704
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:05,710
here's what he says to me.
He goes,

1705
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,170
does he have a Russian accent?
Yeah.

1706
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:10,270
Can you do it?
Oh,

1707
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,100
I can't do that.
I try.

1708
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,710
Well,
here's what he said to me,

1709
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:19,990
knowing this family,
it's a family.

1710
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:20,824
We do what the law says.
We don't do what the grandma's grandma 

1711
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,250
says.
I go,

1712
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:29,560
bitch,
are you new?

1713
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:33,671
I go,
okay,

1714
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,500
well,
if you want to live a curse live,

1715
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:40,340
go ahead and live in fucking curse life.
I put that Judy.

1716
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,970
Yeah,
he's coming around though.

1717
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:51,240
I knew he would have.
Now they have a son and he has adhd too.

1718
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,633
And uh,
but he's brilliant and as all my 

1719
01:25:55,961 --> 01:25:57,250
grandkids.
And anyway,

1720
01:25:57,251 --> 01:25:59,300
so they were there.
Those lived.

1721
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,320
Oh,
I shouldn't have said that loop towards.

1722
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:03,440
No,
you can't say that anymore.

1723
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:04,040
Now you're

1724
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,680
not to say that I forgot because I'm 
old.

1725
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:07,514
I mixed them up.
Who says you're not to say that 

1726
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:10,183
everybody says you don't say the t word,
so as long as you don't have a reebok 

1727
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,560
before,
I think you're allowed to say it.

1728
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,433
No,
I don't say it in public but not and I 

1729
01:26:19,491 --> 01:26:20,860
don't.
But uh,

1730
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:21,830
anyway,
so,

1731
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:23,150
um,
you know,

1732
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:23,984
the kid he's bouncing off the walls to 
like all my kids were so I know how to 

1733
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:27,890
deal with it,
you know,

1734
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,260
I said just leave them over here with 
me.

1735
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:32,900
I'll take care of it.
So I did.

1736
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,070
Would you do with them?
Get them active?

1737
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,360
Yeah.
You get them active.

1738
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:39,620
Get them doing stuff.
Exactly.

1739
01:26:39,621 --> 01:26:42,170
I go,
I bet you I bet you $100.

1740
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:44,960
You can't run up and down that hill 10 
times in a row.

1741
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,430
Perfect.
GotTa keep boys tired.

1742
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:50,563
Yeah.

1743
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:53,630
I guarantee I have adhd.
I have all those things.

1744
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:55,550
Yeah.
You probably do do stuff.

1745
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:57,280
Just burning this stuff.
Yeah.

1746
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:59,360
Bring it out and then he can be calm.
Yeah,

1747
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:00,403
exactly.
I think those kids just have a lot of 

1748
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:02,384
fuel.
I do have a lot of horsepower and a lot 

1749
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:04,814
of fuel and it's all misdirected and 
then get in with the girl and she 

1750
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:10,370
started telling them what to do.
So I'm telling you,

1751
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:14,060
once they get under the control of a 
female,

1752
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:18,380
say there they forget theirselves.
Girls do it too.

1753
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,360
Sure.
We get to control the wrong guy.

1754
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:22,590
You gotta not getting control and 
nobody.

1755
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,440
Anybody.
That's the key.

1756
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:26,630
Autonomy in.
What do they call it?

1757
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:27,550
Sovereignty.
You gotta.

1758
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,470
Keep that.
Find somebody who doesn't control you,

1759
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:33,140
just accepts you.
Light should be.

1760
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:38,270
Don't make your shower.
Now they have to make them shower.

1761
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:39,533
Oh,
my boys should at least suggest it in a 

1762
01:27:41,391 --> 01:27:46,090
nice way to let them know.
Fuck is going on with your smell,

1763
01:27:46,091 --> 01:27:47,060
son.
Yeah.

1764
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,570
I come from weird line of women that 
liked that man's mouth.

1765
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,700
It was gross.
My mom,

1766
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:55,850
she is to always go over and sniff under
my dad's armpits.

1767
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,820
So girls don't wonder.
I'm like,

1768
01:27:58,821 --> 01:28:00,510
I am.
You know.

1769
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:06,340
So when you were tires that she likes 
monkey smell,

1770
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,680
don't say that word.
Funky white guy.

1771
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:10,640
It's all right.
Oh,

1772
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:13,310
you call white people monkeys.
My Dad was real dark.

1773
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:16,010
How dark he was.
Brown.

1774
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:17,443
Brown.
Yeah.

1775
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,773
Well,
um,

1776
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:26,500
maybe it'd be problematic.
She was real fair,

1777
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:28,630
fair,
scanned a mom.

1778
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:33,640
So I've learned a thing or two jail hear
that to me.

1779
01:28:33,651 --> 01:28:34,484
All people look like some kind of.
I mean I didn't say anything about 

1780
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:38,510
Valerie Jarrett,
but don the subject,

1781
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:42,740
I think people resemble animals a lot.
So we are animals.

1782
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:47,450
We are animals.
Like I think I look like a beaver when I

1783
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:48,284
look at my pictures,
do anything I looked like a beaver or a 

1784
01:28:51,531 --> 01:28:56,531
cat detect.
I can see myself as a believer.

1785
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,970
My kids think I'm real catlike yes.
Yeah.

1786
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,060
My boyfriend says slaw off.

1787
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,173
I'd just lay there in bed watching the 
ID channel and murderers and serial 

1788
01:29:10,441 --> 01:29:12,720
killer shows.
Oh my God.

1789
01:29:12,721 --> 01:29:15,630
Because I love how this character is put
together,

1790
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,820
you know,
writing characters,

1791
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,350
you know,
you just like,

1792
01:29:19,351 --> 01:29:22,590
I liked the forensics thing when they 
put shit together,

1793
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:23,424
you know,
and they go,

1794
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:24,503
they are our purpose.
Our purpose of 40 year old white man 

1795
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:32,640
lives with his mother needs prevalent.
It was in the navy,

1796
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:33,541
you know,
all that.

1797
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:38,490
So I love all that I would have done 
that if I wasn't a comic genius.

1798
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:39,443
I think the real real problem with that 
though is that the more you study that 

1799
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:46,500
shit,
the more you live in that world,

1800
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:51,660
the less happiness you're going to find.
I've talked to guys that what world?

1801
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:54,910
The world of serial killers,
the world studying it,

1802
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:58,200
reading about it,
the actual people that investigate those

1803
01:29:58,201 --> 01:29:58,740
people.

1804
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,440
Oh yeah.
They have a real hard time with life.

1805
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,750
They have a real hard time because they 
know too much.

1806
01:30:03,751 --> 01:30:06,930
They know too much about the day.
You watch it show mine hunter.

1807
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:09,930
I didn't watch that one though.
John Douglas.

1808
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:13,230
Yeah.
I've seen so many of those shows.

1809
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:15,540
I've read books on serial killers.
I,

1810
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,100
you know,
and I've,

1811
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,950
I've known cops that investigated stuff 
like this.

1812
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,810
Well after I had that thing with marge,
I got really into it like Oh my God.

1813
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,990
But you realize that some people out 
there that are there,

1814
01:30:26,991 --> 01:30:29,460
but dark mind,
they're capable.

1815
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:31,040
Some fucked up shit.
Yeah they are.

1816
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,880
And if you were around that all the 
time,

1817
01:30:32,881 --> 01:30:36,930
I just think you're appreciation for.
It's like it's one thing to know that it

1818
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,810
exists and it's real,
but it's another thing to let that enter

1819
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:40,644
into your,
your view of the world and have it in 

1820
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,470
there as a standard standard trying to 
behavior.

1821
01:30:46,471 --> 01:30:48,680
I guess it's wrong to do that,
but you know,

1822
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,100
nothing else interests me.

1823
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:53,453
Why is it interesting to you so much?
Just because it's such a bizarre how 

1824
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:58,880
they get away with it and they're like,
oh,

1825
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:02,550
he was the nicest guy.
How they their front,

1826
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,290
you know the golden state killer,
right?

1827
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:06,830
You know that one,
that they just this together.

1828
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,750
That was what it was called Golden state
killer.

1829
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,510
That fucking guy got away with it 
forever.

1830
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:13,913
Patton Oswalt's wife who died of a drug 
overdose was actually investigating 

1831
01:31:17,851 --> 01:31:19,110
that.
She died of a drug.

1832
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,360
I thought she died from fentanyl.
Oh,

1833
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:24,330
everyone's dying from that.
Started from that shit.

1834
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:26,480
Everybody's standing from that.
I mean,

1835
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:32,030
where can I get some?
It must be good if that's the conners to

1836
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:36,830
get you.
I don't know what you're gonna do A.

1837
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:39,590
I don't want to say nothing negative.
Bring you back.

1838
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,473
You'll be like a.
You could be like a from beyond the 

1839
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:43,434
grave.
You could give advice to people on the 

1840
01:31:44,761 --> 01:31:45,990
show.
That'd be a great way.

1841
01:31:45,991 --> 01:31:48,220
They can kill you off and bring you back
to the same time.

1842
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:49,123
Ghost a ghost.
He come to John Goodman the middle of 

1843
01:31:51,691 --> 01:31:53,880
the night.
What the fuck are you talking about?

1844
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:56,813
Yeah.
You come up with something better than 

1845
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:00,220
just

1846
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,380
killing you off.
Yeah.

1847
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,310
Then just letting it go.
Well,

1848
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:04,173
I think,
I mean they do all these movies about 

1849
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:06,334
robots and other words.
I don't want to be connected with a 

1850
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:10,180
racist,
a racist,

1851
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,950
and that's what's so fucking stupid 
about this.

1852
01:32:11,951 --> 01:32:14,390
They had a number one show,
a great sitcoms.

1853
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:16,150
It returns.
It's even,

1854
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,810
it's just as good if not better than it 
was when it first came out.

1855
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,040
It was a bit better too.
It was great.

1856
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,660
Thank you.
Well,

1857
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:23,494
you know,
that was all I was meant to do so you 

1858
01:32:25,031 --> 01:32:25,864
know,
I did it.

1859
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:30,520
I did it number one after 20 years.
What about doing standup again?

1860
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:35,610
I'm doing standup.
I'm tillery next year and by then and my

1861
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:42,160
gag order will be over.
You have a gag order.

1862
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,870
Can you talk about the gag order or is 
that a part of the gag order?

1863
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,540
It's a part.
Be careful.

1864
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:52,700
Go are there that I can talk about it.
Let's just talk about.

1865
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:54,453
Yeah,
I just want to say I wish everybody the 

1866
01:32:57,431 --> 01:32:58,181
best.
You know,

1867
01:32:58,181 --> 01:32:58,901
I.
I wish.

1868
01:32:58,901 --> 01:33:02,440
Well for everyone on earth.
That's all I'm going to say.

1869
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,870
When are you going to do standup next 
year?

1870
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:05,770
Twenty,
19?

1871
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:06,673
Where are you going to do it?
I can't remember what they said in the 

1872
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:12,940
Midwest.
All across the Midwest.

1873
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:15,100
Are you writing already?
Are you performing at all?

1874
01:33:15,101 --> 01:33:15,934
I mean,
are you.

1875
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,460
You're just writing?
Yeah.

1876
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,290
And how are you going to do it?
Are you going to start out at clubs?

1877
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:23,950
Are you going to theaters,
casinos?

1878
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:27,370
Do you have a framework of what you're 
going to talk about?

1879
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:33,230
Talk about raising good sons and all 
that that entails.

1880
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:36,640
Are you going to bring someone with you 
on the road to warm up or.

1881
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:38,530
I probably should.
I don't know.

1882
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:39,364
I have.
It's kind of saying I wanted to call 

1883
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:41,193
headline too.
I thought to co headlined with Monique 

1884
01:33:44,561 --> 01:33:46,720
would be a blast.
That's a great idea.

1885
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:49,330
Me and her talked about it.
That'd be fun.

1886
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,733
Yeah.
I mean anybody just just to get out 

1887
01:33:52,991 --> 01:33:54,280
there again,
tell me a joke.

1888
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:59,290
I really liked hearing people laugh.
That'd be a great thing for you to do it

1889
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:00,760
better.
Do it.

1890
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:02,290
How long has it been Susan?
Stand up.

1891
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,270
Oh,
I did it just before,

1892
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:05,350
you know.
In fact,

1893
01:34:05,351 --> 01:34:07,670
I think that's why I got so rundown.
You know,

1894
01:34:07,671 --> 01:34:10,660
I got so rundown when I,
you know,

1895
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:11,613
this whole thing.
I was so run down at that point that I 

1896
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:18,580
had no b vitamins in my body.
How's it impossible?

1897
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:20,980
Well,
I made was that really low level?

1898
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,840
And the doctor said,
you know,

1899
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:25,840
that can cause psychosis.
So that's where I go.

1900
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:28,180
Okay.
That's what happened to me.

1901
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:29,770
Really.
I was at white.

1902
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:32,080
I was getting way out there in Salt Lake
City,

1903
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:32,914
Utah.
Anyway,

1904
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:33,873
after I,
I did do standup all through Canada and 

1905
01:34:35,951 --> 01:34:40,951
then I ended up in New York doing promo 
for Rosanne and uh,

1906
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:42,730
you know,
I just got to run down.

1907
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:43,564
I didn't,
I didn't watch myself and do what I 

1908
01:34:45,401 --> 01:34:48,970
should have done for my physical health 
this time around.

1909
01:34:48,971 --> 01:34:49,804
Let's get you sorted it out and sketch 
on some vitamins and get your 

1910
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:57,590
nutritionist and get somebody who's 
going to do some blood work you and make

1911
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:59,240
sure everything's okay.
Blood work done.

1912
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:00,074
I always go,
I go to the cancer center at a whatever 

1913
01:35:03,201 --> 01:35:05,540
that hospitals called over there.
Yeah,

1914
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:06,374
that's good.
But I always have to have infusions 

1915
01:35:08,091 --> 01:35:12,760
every three months because I,
I don't absorb minerals or vitamins.

1916
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:14,710
What do you mean you don't absorb them?
Yeah.

1917
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:19,780
I had this gastric bypass about 25 or so
years ago and I can't absorb minerals or

1918
01:35:20,751 --> 01:35:24,020
vitamins and so I have to go get 
infusions every,

1919
01:35:24,330 --> 01:35:26,990
you know,
when I get to down and I,

1920
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:30,560
like I said,
I was promoting the residential and also

1921
01:35:30,561 --> 01:35:34,190
doing some touring Canada and I got to 
run down and I,

1922
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,041
I just,
uh,

1923
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:35,860
I,
I,

1924
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:38,360
I think I had a mental collapse.
I told the network,

1925
01:35:38,361 --> 01:35:39,194
I said,
obviously I'm not behaving in the right 

1926
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:46,300
way and I will check myself in and get 
my meds checked to make sure I'm,

1927
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:48,050
you know,
you know,

1928
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:51,710
so I said I have mental health issues 
and you know,

1929
01:35:51,711 --> 01:35:52,544
I,
I said also I thought that woman was 

1930
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:57,800
white and it wasn't anything about race.
It was about Iran.

1931
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,020
And it was like,
well,

1932
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,300
we'll see how this washes out in 
Sherman.

1933
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:07,040
Yeah,
we'll see how this washes.

1934
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:11,570
And then 20 minutes later Wanda Sykes 
tweeted,

1935
01:36:11,571 --> 01:36:12,830
let me off this show.

1936
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,380
And then Sarah Gilbert tweeted,
shortly thereafter a,

1937
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:24,670
something about she was ashamed of one 
cast member and a would.

1938
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:28,710
That one blew me away.
And uh,

1939
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,313
and Michael Fishman tweeted a,
he was ashamed of my racism or some 

1940
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:36,500
shit.
And uh,

1941
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,240
that was hard to take.
But,

1942
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,910
uh,
it was because it was so,

1943
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:43,820
it seemed orchestrated because they use 
the same words,

1944
01:36:43,821 --> 01:36:47,210
you know,
a egregious unforgivable.

1945
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:50,390
But in fact it might have been 
offensive.

1946
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,310
And like when I was talking to Mike 
Today,

1947
01:36:52,311 --> 01:36:52,911
I said,
you know,

1948
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:55,880
we all say things that are racially 
insensitive at times.

1949
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:58,340
All of us do that.
I'm a Jew,

1950
01:36:58,341 --> 01:37:02,610
I've heard everything and uh,
you know,

1951
01:37:02,611 --> 01:37:05,420
or,
or ethnically offensive to somebody,

1952
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:08,360
but that doesn't mean where the KKK.
Okay.

1953
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,530
That doesn't mean we're,
uh,

1954
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:13,550
you know,
fascists or you know,

1955
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:17,390
and especially if we apologize because 
most people who are offensive,

1956
01:37:17,391 --> 01:37:20,180
they mean to be offensive and they don't
apologize.

1957
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,910
And I think that's when,
you know there's a difference and if you

1958
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:23,983
don't have the discretion to understand 
that something's wrong with you and I 

1959
01:37:28,341 --> 01:37:32,180
think something's wrong with people that
they're so hateful and uh,

1960
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:37,390
so unforgiving and if you don't vote the
way they think you should vote,

1961
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:40,940
that they feel justified in being.
So,

1962
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:42,630
um,
what's the word?

1963
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:47,330
Self sanctimonious and self righteous.
And when they themselves are,

1964
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:51,530
you know,
kind of saying far more offensive things

1965
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:54,620
about people's children and such.
For instance,

1966
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,483
I think people are just cowards.
And I think when things like this 

1967
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:58,104
happen,
they want to separate themselves from 

1968
01:37:58,831 --> 01:37:59,664
controversy and make sure that they're 
not a part of the people that I can 

1969
01:38:02,391 --> 01:38:04,620
understand that I can kind of understand
that,

1970
01:38:04,621 --> 01:38:07,120
but I don't get it.
I don't they do,

1971
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:09,500
you know,
and you know,

1972
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,310
I'm like,
wow.

1973
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:12,593
They also get really,
really upset when a few years later 

1974
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,830
somebody does the exact same thing to 
them and go,

1975
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:24,450
what goes around comes around and that's
true and especially true in Hollywood.

1976
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,920
That guide that fired me just was fired 
a couple of weeks ago for what?

1977
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,290
I don't know that his contract wasn't 
renewed and his last words were,

1978
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:35,124
well,
I didn't know I'd be forced to cancel 

1979
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:41,010
our number one show.
It wasn't forced to do anything.

1980
01:38:41,011 --> 01:38:42,360
Well,
he might've been forced.

1981
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:44,150
They're all fools.
This should just.

1982
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,680
First of all,
they should have let the dust settle.

1983
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:47,813
Second of all,
they should have examined what you 

1984
01:38:49,321 --> 01:38:54,270
actually said and what your intentions 
were and let you apologize and then have

1985
01:38:54,271 --> 01:38:57,660
a conversation with you on one of their 
shows in long form.

1986
01:38:57,850 --> 01:38:58,683
You May,
in a teaching moment such as Valerie 

1987
01:39:00,421 --> 01:39:02,580
jarret would have accepted that.
I said,

1988
01:39:02,581 --> 01:39:06,960
I would like to debate her on the Iran 
deal and explain what I what I said,

1989
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:07,590
well,
you know,

1990
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:12,510
that's not necessarily what Americans 
should know about that deal.

1991
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:13,681
Well,
maybe they should,

1992
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:16,140
but I don't think that's completely 
related to the tweet,

1993
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,140
but it would have been a teachable 
moment maybe,

1994
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:22,830
but it also would've been a distraction 
from what you were trying to say.

1995
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:24,920
Well,
they didn't let me say it right.

1996
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:26,670
And uh,
you know,

1997
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:29,130
um,
but to get involved like openly,

1998
01:39:29,131 --> 01:39:31,370
politically,
the television show,

1999
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:33,630
that's dangerous.
But Taylor swift just did it.

2000
01:39:34,570 --> 01:39:38,040
What did she say?
Just get out and vote Democrat.

2001
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:40,950
Wasn't that like,
it's almost abstract.

2002
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:42,240
Get out and vote,
you know,

2003
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:44,550
she's not,
she said vote for the Democrat.

2004
01:39:44,551 --> 01:39:46,800
I don't like the Republican.
Marsha Blackburn,

2005
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:47,993
she didn't like her.
Although Marsha Blackburn has been the 

2006
01:39:50,581 --> 01:39:54,930
author of a lot of great anti rape laws 
and all kinds of stuff like that,

2007
01:39:54,931 --> 01:39:57,180
but she didn't like her because she's a 
Republican,

2008
01:39:57,181 --> 01:40:00,600
says she took a stand,
a political stand,

2009
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:01,763
I guess.
Uh,

2010
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:03,300
you know,
some people can do it,

2011
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:08,130
but some people can't.
And the political stand I took,

2012
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:11,260
which I just want to remind people is 
that I'm,

2013
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:13,020
I'm,
I'm an independent.

2014
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,210
That's my stance.

2015
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:18,203
And I just thought both sides had gone 
too far out and need to talk to each 

2016
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:21,864
other.
So I came back and did a show about 

2017
01:40:23,311 --> 01:40:24,144
that.
That's the stance you took with your 

2018
01:40:26,491 --> 01:40:31,491
show and in my life it's like if we can 
even discuss things that's really,

2019
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:34,860
really bad,
that's not American.

2020
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:39,920
We we discuss and debate.
We don't label and black list,

2021
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:41,063
which we certainly can talk things and 
maybe that's something that you could 

2022
01:40:43,811 --> 01:40:46,950
have done once they had a conversation 
with you about your tweet.

2023
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:48,263
But I mean I just think that what they 
did was just very hasty and very 

2024
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:51,653
foolhardy.
And they should have known who were 

2025
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:54,100
beforehand.

2026
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,050
They should have known about your mental
health issues.

2027
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:57,063
They should know.
They should have known about your 

2028
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:00,640
medication issues,
all of those things.

2029
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:02,553
But this is what my point was.
If you have a person with a broken leg 

2030
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:08,520
and they can't run and you get mad at 
them because they can't run the.

2031
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:09,790
Isn't that ridiculous?
Well,

2032
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:13,960
if you have a person that has brain 
issues and then they do something that's

2033
01:41:13,961 --> 01:41:14,794
erratic and you're mad at them for that,
well you're a fucking idiot that's 

2034
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:18,784
stupid and you call them a racist or 
chastise them in front of the world so 

2035
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:23,734
that you remove any possible any,
any possible negative opinions that 

2036
01:41:32,141 --> 01:41:34,640
could be cast your way,
but that's what a lot of it is,

2037
01:41:34,641 --> 01:41:35,474
is deflection.
They're worried about negative opinions 

2038
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,823
and negative feedback that's going to 
come their way so they immediately turn 

2039
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:42,160
on you.

2040
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,960
They turn on you in a disproportionate 
way.

2041
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:46,220
While they did cancel the show before 
evening,

2042
01:41:46,221 --> 01:41:51,221
one advertiser had pulled out.
It's the Sarah Silvermans bet.

2043
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:56,580
I'm against a amber that I'm against it.
Well,

2044
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,353
there's a lot of cowardice going on.
There's a lot of people trying to save 

2045
01:41:59,741 --> 01:42:00,574
their jobs and people panic because 
people are aware of the outrage culture 

2046
01:42:03,341 --> 01:42:06,470
that we live in.
This is an outrage nation right now.

2047
01:42:06,471 --> 01:42:07,304
It's.
It's one of our number one forms of 

2048
01:42:09,221 --> 01:42:10,840
recreation.
People love it.

2049
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:13,480
They love getting mad at whoever the 
fuck it is.

2050
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:15,910
As long as you react the way they want 
you to react.

2051
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:17,013
Oh,
they love it.

2052
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:19,750
It's an inquisition.
Well,

2053
01:42:19,751 --> 01:42:24,751
it's the understanding that people have 
way more power to affect change.

2054
01:42:25,991 --> 01:42:26,824
Whether it's good change or bad change.
They're pushing buttons with social 

2055
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:33,400
media and without rage and with their 
ability to express themselves.

2056
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,233
It's unprecedented.
There's never been a time like this in 

2057
01:42:35,591 --> 01:42:39,590
history where people can Salem witch 
trials,

2058
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:42,310
right?
Well that was just like,

2059
01:42:42,311 --> 01:42:43,144
okay,
well if you swam that proves you're a 

2060
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:46,630
witch,
and then we have to drown.

2061
01:42:46,631 --> 01:42:49,220
You know,
uh,

2062
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:53,740
it has said there has to be a loser,
there has to be two winters.

2063
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,540
Well,
there,

2064
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:56,980
there has to be an understanding of 
what's happening here.

2065
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:57,933
And then people have to have an 
understanding of the power that they're 

2066
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:03,340
wielding and what they're doing and that
it turned back on them.

2067
01:43:03,341 --> 01:43:04,174
And it never just stop at one person.
That's why I said I'm surprised that a 

2068
01:43:07,811 --> 01:43:11,200
lot more comics didn't defend me because
you know,

2069
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:12,093
this means that anything they find it in
your timeline that they think is 

2070
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:16,504
offensive,
they can mischaracterize and bringing a 

2071
01:43:18,551 --> 01:43:19,384
whole a battle against you that you 
can't possibly win and take your life's 

2072
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:23,710
work.

2073
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:25,010
Well,
how many did defend you?

2074
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:30,940
I'm nobody defended me,
but I did.

2075
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:32,560
You did.
Thank you.

2076
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:33,611
Stan.
Hope.

2077
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:35,260
Did Stan hope dead?
Yeah.

2078
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:39,310
Um,
there was a time that we're working with

2079
01:43:39,311 --> 01:43:40,750
no,
none of them that worked with you.

2080
01:43:40,810 --> 01:43:41,643
Well,
everybody that works,

2081
01:43:41,650 --> 01:43:43,250
you wanted to keep their job.
Yeah.

2082
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:46,240
And I don't blame them.
Don't blame them.

2083
01:43:46,241 --> 01:43:49,000
They needed the money and probably 
already spent it.

2084
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,500
Well,
the other thing too,

2085
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:55,280
the life that,
that fucking schedule is ruthless.

2086
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:57,170
It's growing.
You know what I think it was,

2087
01:43:57,171 --> 01:43:58,600
a lot of it was,
um,

2088
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,310
you know,
I gave him the gun to shoot me.

2089
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:03,830
I mean,
I wasn't a helpless victim,

2090
01:44:03,831 --> 01:44:08,831
although I think my explanation either 
make sense or doesn't make sense.

2091
01:44:09,261 --> 01:44:10,094
But uh,
well if you're compassionate it makes 

2092
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:14,210
sense.
But a lot of people aren't.

2093
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:15,103
But,
um,

2094
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:16,720
you know,
uh,

2095
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:18,073
I forgot what I was getting.

2096
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,790
I don't even know if they're not 
compassionate.

2097
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:21,200
Roseanne.
I think they're scared.

2098
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:24,410
I think that just chicken shit.
I don't think they're looking at it from

2099
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:27,560
it in terms of like,
I can't win here and I can't lose here.

2100
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:29,600
Let me just look at what's right.
See,

2101
01:44:29,601 --> 01:44:31,910
I didn't have anything to win or lose.
So what I looked at it,

2102
01:44:31,911 --> 01:44:33,680
I looked at you as someone that I 
admire.

2103
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:34,583
Some of that I think is one of the best 
comics ever who I think I know that you 

2104
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:39,920
have mental health issues.
I knew from talking to you that you were

2105
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:42,740
on Ambien and I knew you had alcohol as 
well.

2106
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:44,870
I know what that does.
My mom took ambien.

2107
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:49,490
She woke up in the middle of the night 
and drew all over the bathroom rug,

2108
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:51,680
drool over it with lipstick and,
and,

2109
01:44:51,681 --> 01:44:53,300
and um,
and nail Polish.

2110
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,060
She said like a little kid.
So Shit.

2111
01:44:55,061 --> 01:44:57,080
You woke up in the morning.
She had no idea she did it.

2112
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:59,390
She's terrified of that shit.
She won't take it now.

2113
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:00,573
I have friends,
many friends that have had bad 

2114
01:45:03,081 --> 01:45:05,480
experiences on ambulance tail and I 
thought,

2115
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:06,343
well,
they shouldn't have shut down that 

2116
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:08,780
conversation like that.
They shouldn't have.

2117
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:12,770
It's a fucking dangerous drug to for the
wrong people in the wrong situations.

2118
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:13,783
Especially when you mix it with alcohol.
I mean it's beneficial to people that 

2119
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:18,740
need sleep in certain situations.
I don't recommend it,

2120
01:45:18,741 --> 01:45:20,570
I don't take it,
but some people like it.

2121
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:21,703
That's fine.
But to ignore what the actual 

2122
01:45:23,571 --> 01:45:28,520
pharmacological effect on the human body
is is ridiculous because there's studies

2123
01:45:28,521 --> 01:45:29,354
on this shit and that people understand 
the interaction between chemicals and 

2124
01:45:32,271 --> 01:45:33,104
the human brain and there are erratic 
and especially when you mix them with 

2125
01:45:35,721 --> 01:45:37,010
things,
you're not supposed to mix them with.

2126
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:40,290
Weird Shit happens.
I thought it was gonna.

2127
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:44,110
I thought I was going to expand on it in
the morning and you know,

2128
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:49,120
talk about that movie and a too late.
Yeah,

2129
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:51,290
well it could.
It was too late to put.

2130
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,340
The whole thing is just fucking crazy 
when,

2131
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:56,420
when telling me not to tweet.
Yeah.

2132
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,860
Well,
it's probably a good idea,

2133
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:03,340
but now honestly the problem also a 
twitter's fucking text is just too.

2134
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:08,630
It's too simple.
It's too crude a way of communicating.

2135
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:09,603
It really is,
but you can get across some ideas like 

2136
01:46:11,271 --> 01:46:12,104
you can say,
hey,

2137
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:13,970
I went to see little foot's a great 
movie.

2138
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:16,740
That's a good thing to tweet.
Real simple shit like that,

2139
01:46:16,741 --> 01:46:17,574
but you want to talk about like 
political things or things that involve 

2140
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:23,390
nuance or seeing things that are 
complex.

2141
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:25,560
I just don't think it's the way to 
communicate.

2142
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:30,600
I know it's terrible way to communicate,
not communicate.

2143
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,810
It's like a,
what did he say?

2144
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:36,740
A search and destroy oil.
For some folks,

2145
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:41,720
there's going to be people that always 
want to make things crash and burn.

2146
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,740
They like it.
They like buttons.

2147
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:46,310
They like hitting the buttons.
They like to see people suffer.

2148
01:46:46,670 --> 01:46:47,503
Well.
They definitely are suffering 

2149
01:46:48,381 --> 01:46:49,530
themselves.
Look,

2150
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:50,423
there's a giant percentage of our 
population that lives in misery that 

2151
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:57,240
they do all day long and they.
They have mental health issues.

2152
01:46:57,241 --> 01:46:58,860
They're exhausted,
they're depressed,

2153
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,870
they're there.
They have despair,

2154
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,793
they're overwhelmed with bills.
They're in shitty relationships and 

2155
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:05,203
they're overwhelmed and they're angry 
and they look at someone like you are 

2156
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:09,090
rich white lady,
and I'm like,

2157
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:11,010
fuck that bitch,
and they just want to attack you.

2158
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:12,013
It doesn't have to make sense because 
it's a reflection of their own personal 

2159
01:47:14,251 --> 01:47:15,084
pain as much as it's a reflection of 
their irresponsibility with this power 

2160
01:47:18,451 --> 01:47:20,040
that they're wielding through social 
media.

2161
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,083
And then there's the mob mentality.
There's a bunch of people that are 

2162
01:47:22,891 --> 01:47:23,970
already going after you.
Good.

2163
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:26,610
I want to go after a two.
I'm going to show the world that I'm not

2164
01:47:26,611 --> 01:47:28,080
racist and you know how I'm going to do 
that.

2165
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:31,140
I'm going to shit all over this racist,
this racist Roseanne.

2166
01:47:31,141 --> 01:47:32,700
They don't care if you're really racist.

2167
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:34,750
But the thing that gets me about it is 
it's,

2168
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:35,613
I'm going to shit all over this Jew 
because I was talking about Iran as a 

2169
01:47:39,791 --> 01:47:43,180
Jew and speaking about Persian Jews and 
uh,

2170
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:44,043
you know,
all kinds of error when you're talking 

2171
01:47:45,701 --> 01:47:48,070
about complexity.
It is complex,

2172
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:50,640
but I always was on there talking,
uh,

2173
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:53,050
you know,
defending or,

2174
01:47:53,051 --> 01:47:55,510
you know,
speaking for Jewish people.

2175
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:56,620
And so,
you know,

2176
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:59,590
I just,
I think that in the long run I've really

2177
01:47:59,591 --> 01:48:00,424
wanted to be known that I,
I am a Jew and we're speaking as a Jew 

2178
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,313
and when I spoke about the Iran deal and
its effect on a Jewish people in the 

2179
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:10,833
Middle East,
and I really thought first they didn't 

2180
01:48:13,721 --> 01:48:15,520
know that,
but now I think,

2181
01:48:15,521 --> 01:48:20,320
well they had to know some of it.
I don't think they want to know.

2182
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:24,340
This is what I think you say when 
someone says that's a black woman.

2183
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:27,130
What is she one eighth black,
like what is she?

2184
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:29,320
Um,
something very small,

2185
01:48:29,321 --> 01:48:31,140
46 percent or something.
Really?

2186
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:32,103
Yeah.
She had her DNA done was talking about 

2187
01:48:35,081 --> 01:48:40,081
it and 40 something Caucasian and it 
doesn't look like,

2188
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:41,950
but whatever,
whatever.

2189
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:46,480
We can't tell who people are by how they
look on one point six percent African.

2190
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:48,880
Cool.
Awesome.

2191
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:54,070
That's the heart of the world.
When you look at what happened,

2192
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:56,710
I think it's real simple.
I think

2193
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:59,850
she identifies or people identify her as
a black woman.

2194
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:02,460
You said planet of the Apes Racist.
Boom.

2195
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:04,350
It's that simple.
I don't think they give a fuck if you're

2196
01:49:04,351 --> 01:49:05,184
a Jew.
I don't think they care if you're not 

2197
01:49:06,511 --> 01:49:08,040
racist.
I think this is a

2198
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:09,990
viable target.
And they go,

2199
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:12,440
well,
I said I voted for trump.

2200
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:15,240
So that was a target to that too.
And then,

2201
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:16,760
and then they could find a,
a,

2202
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:20,570
a tweet from the past.
I forget either.

2203
01:49:20,690 --> 01:49:21,523
Oh yeah.
Maya got in trouble for that alone many 

2204
01:49:23,481 --> 01:49:26,990
times.
There's just things you can't say.

2205
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,420
And then there's worse things that you 
can.

2206
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:33,800
So it's weird because they don't censor 
anybody who's calling for,

2207
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:34,281
uh,
you know,

2208
01:49:34,281 --> 01:49:35,114
to kill all the Jews.
There's thousands of them just shared 

2209
01:49:38,211 --> 01:49:40,460
about the not famous women with sitcoms.
Yeah,

2210
01:49:40,461 --> 01:49:42,110
they are who,
uh,

2211
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:43,550
you know,
people that are,

2212
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:46,730
are tweeting support for Valerie 
Jarrett,

2213
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:51,650
you know,
they're pissed at me and saying,

2214
01:49:51,651 --> 01:49:52,484
how could you say this about not saying 
that because they're saying kill the 

2215
01:49:55,221 --> 01:49:56,240
Jews.
They don't,

2216
01:49:56,270 --> 01:50:01,120
they don't.
Maybe know what your point was like.

2217
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:03,650
I didn't know about her parentage.
I mean,

2218
01:50:03,651 --> 01:50:04,560
come on.
This is,

2219
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,920
this is the truth.
This is who I am.

2220
01:50:06,921 --> 01:50:08,270
And you know,
they,

2221
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:09,283
they,
uh,

2222
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:10,213
they did this too,
but they're not really saying kill the 

2223
01:50:11,841 --> 01:50:13,630
Jews.
It's not like a valid comparison.

2224
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:16,220
Well I'm a Jew,
I understand that.

2225
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:18,920
But the people,
that's how it feels.

2226
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:23,250
Maybe it feels that way to you guys.
But the people that are robust,

2227
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:25,970
they're upset at you because they think 
you said something racist.

2228
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:28,990
They're not saying kill the Jews.
Well,

2229
01:50:28,991 --> 01:50:33,710
but they are to us.
Okay.

2230
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:37,550
You see how when people look at your 
situation,

2231
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:40,940
I can see how they think.
But you see how when people look at your

2232
01:50:40,941 --> 01:50:45,941
situation and they think it's racist,
that is also how you look at.

2233
01:50:47,150 --> 01:50:47,983
They're reacting to what they think is 
racist and you thinking that they're 

2234
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:52,070
saying kill all the Jews.

2235
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,920
They're saying like,
uh,

2236
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:54,783
you know,
Iran everyday threatens the Jewish 

2237
01:50:58,061 --> 01:51:01,930
people in Israel with annihilation and 
they've already survived,

2238
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:03,790
you know,
not too long ago,

2239
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:05,680
an annihilation.
So,

2240
01:51:05,681 --> 01:51:07,810
and then we make a deal with that 
government.

2241
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,030
What does that say something?
I understand that,

2242
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:10,864
but this is many steps past.
But to me that you said a racist thing 

2243
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:15,903
or thinking you said a racist.
And understand that they think I said a 

2244
01:51:18,701 --> 01:51:21,610
racist thing.
I understand that completely.

2245
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:25,120
They have no idea that this had anything
to do with Jews versus Iran.

2246
01:51:25,150 --> 01:51:27,740
They really don't have any idea.
I've never seen that.

2247
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,080
I've never seen that registered.
But because it's not important enough to

2248
01:51:32,081 --> 01:51:32,914
them to know that well,
it's probably not been explained to 

2249
01:51:36,281 --> 01:51:37,360
them.
For one,

2250
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,520
I know your position like this,
like you're,

2251
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,533
you're talking about now I understand 
that they might not even think it's 

2252
01:51:42,881 --> 01:51:43,714
valid.
Like if they went back and went over it 

2253
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:48,640
and you might disagree with the 
political aspects of it.

2254
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:50,560
Yes.
And they're free to do that.

2255
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:53,380
I'm not going to try to be know what I'm
saying.

2256
01:51:53,381 --> 01:51:55,690
Like they're not the reason why I said 
it's not a valid comparison.

2257
01:51:55,691 --> 01:51:57,160
They're not really saying kill the Jews,

2258
01:51:57,490 --> 01:52:01,270
but to me and to other Jews,
they are in fact saying that.

2259
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:04,990
And,
and that's very common amongst us.

2260
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,760
So you know,
that's,

2261
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:13,140
that's the truth that many of us think 
and you know,

2262
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:18,420
people are understand it or they don't 
care to even consider it.

2263
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:21,070
Well,
they don't have to,

2264
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:25,030
but I'm still going to say it because 
that's the reality.

2265
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:30,700
It's the reality to hear that and to 
hear the United States wanting gave them

2266
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:31,563
billions of our tax dollars when they're
the number one supporter of terror in 

2267
01:52:35,351 --> 01:52:38,060
the world.
It is and they always do Kale,

2268
01:52:38,061 --> 01:52:43,030
Jews like in Paris and wherever else 
they go and they do it in London too.

2269
01:52:43,031 --> 01:52:43,870
I mean,
you know,

2270
01:52:43,871 --> 01:52:46,490
I hate to wake people up,
but you know,

2271
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:47,953
it is important.
At least it is to me and to people like 

2272
01:52:50,721 --> 01:52:51,554
me and to many other people.
Many Christians is very important to 

2273
01:52:54,861 --> 01:52:56,070
them,
to their.

2274
01:52:56,170 --> 01:52:59,750
They're under onslaught too.
I'm not exactly sure what you're talking

2275
01:52:59,751 --> 01:53:00,584
about because you're talking about 
Iranians killing people in Paris and 

2276
01:53:04,281 --> 01:53:05,114
England.
I'm talking about being the number one 

2277
01:53:06,801 --> 01:53:09,980
sponsor of terror in the world.
Iran,

2278
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:15,050
but they're killing people in France and
England that are Jews.

2279
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:15,950
Who,
when?

2280
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:17,240
When is this happening?
Well,

2281
01:53:17,241 --> 01:53:20,540
when they that theater and a lot of 
other times,

2282
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:25,541
but there's a lot of Jewish woman to 
death and her and her Paris apartment.

2283
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:28,730
There's a lot of it.
I'm not saying they only killed Jews,

2284
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:29,893
but they do kale juice and the money 
goes back to those terrorist 

2285
01:53:35,001 --> 01:53:39,470
organizations that are funded by Qatar 
and Iran.

2286
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,290
Okay.
This is a.

2287
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:44,350
This is a pretty.
These,

2288
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,600
these are general things you're saying,
right?

2289
01:53:46,601 --> 01:53:47,434
Yeah.
It's very general and there's 100 

2290
01:53:48,911 --> 01:53:50,950
shades.
There's 100 shades,

2291
01:53:50,951 --> 01:53:54,820
but I'm just saying as a Jew with a 
family in Israel,

2292
01:53:55,090 --> 01:53:55,923
this is what we think and this is how we
feel and to not even acknowledge that 

2293
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,980
and any discussion is kind of 
disturbing.

2294
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:03,823
It should be factored in.
I don't think it's a matter of not 

2295
01:54:05,471 --> 01:54:06,304
acknowledging it.
I think it should be factored in as 

2296
01:54:07,991 --> 01:54:08,824
well.
They're aware that this had anything to 

2297
01:54:10,181 --> 01:54:11,820
do with your motivation.
Well,

2298
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:13,780
express.
I've never read it anywhere,

2299
01:54:13,830 --> 01:54:17,130
but you can't say it last time I'm 
saying it.

2300
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:17,973
He can't say it.
It's not really smiled on to go against 

2301
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:28,980
the people who control our media and 
say,

2302
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:35,070
especially social media and say that 
you're pro Israel or you know,

2303
01:54:35,591 --> 01:54:37,420
that you think,
um,

2304
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:43,070
you don't think that the media will 
allow you to be pro Israel.

2305
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,750
I mean,
that seems like a really common thing,

2306
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:47,450
not on social media for the most part.
No,

2307
01:54:47,451 --> 01:54:49,530
it's very anti Israel.
You'll,

2308
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:51,570
I'll send you statistics.
Well,

2309
01:54:51,571 --> 01:54:55,700
I see some anti Israel sentiment and 
especially in relation to a,

2310
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:57,890
they treat the Palestinians

2311
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:01,740
like I see a lot of that.
Well,

2312
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:04,700
I'm not going to play into either of 
those because I,

2313
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,580
I really believe that,
uh,

2314
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:08,610
you know,
there's a solution to that problem.

2315
01:55:08,611 --> 01:55:11,070
The solution is pace and I think it can 
be achieved.

2316
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:14,910
So I'm not going to play either one of 
those games about who does this or what.

2317
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:18,180
I'd just like to see a solution that 
works for all the people.

2318
01:55:18,181 --> 01:55:21,750
They're all people.
They're so,

2319
01:55:21,751 --> 01:55:22,584
um,
but it can be but it can't be if one 

2320
01:55:26,101 --> 01:55:29,520
side has been completely censored and 
it,

2321
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:34,550
that isn't a discussion or is it a 
debate and nor is it an American scary.

2322
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:38,340
It's scary times when,
you know,

2323
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:39,443
like on our college campuses today,
I know this because my son was on one 

2324
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:46,410
and you know,
it's a far left far left.

2325
01:55:46,411 --> 01:55:51,030
Professors that espouse that kind of 
stuff daily in all of our colleges.

2326
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:55,620
And it does find its way to the media.
You look at the media that most,

2327
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:57,833
what are they called,
millennium millennials consume and it's 

2328
01:56:00,811 --> 01:56:02,210
heavily,
uh,

2329
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:06,830
to the left it is.
And so that's where they're informing.

2330
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:07,810
They're,
they,

2331
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:08,683
they are getting their opinions from 
only hearing one side of things on 

2332
01:56:12,631 --> 01:56:14,640
social media.
And I don't think that's good.

2333
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:15,773
I don't think it's good that all 
conservative voices are being censored 

2334
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:20,420
off twitter.
You know,

2335
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:22,650
and not all,
I shouldn't say all,

2336
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:26,700
but so many are because that's a way to 
shut down discussion to.

2337
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:28,950
There's quite a few conservative voices 
on twitter,

2338
01:56:28,951 --> 01:56:29,784
but some are when they think they're 
inflammatory or they think they're 

2339
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:33,990
espousing hate.
Yeah.

2340
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:35,083
But they get to decide that you're this 
deciding that it's people who are 

2341
01:56:39,061 --> 01:56:40,650
heavily political.
Yes.

2342
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:42,600
That's not right.
It shouldn't be.

2343
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:45,323
It should be more in the middle where 
we're both sides are considered to come 

2344
01:56:48,361 --> 01:56:49,194
to a consensus means is a diverse 
opinion and that's how you reach 

2345
01:56:53,281 --> 01:56:54,114
consensus.

2346
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:55,043
You don't get a consensus.
So nor solution from only listening to 

2347
01:56:58,111 --> 01:57:01,530
one side blather on the same ship for 20
years.

2348
01:57:02,150 --> 01:57:04,290
That keeps people fighting at each 
other,

2349
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:07,260
not always fighting.
I think it recruits people for the other

2350
01:57:07,261 --> 01:57:08,094
side.
I think it does the opposite of its 

2351
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:11,190
intended effect.
That's one of my friends said.

2352
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:15,450
He said he thinks Michael Moore.
That's Michael Moore's role since he's a

2353
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:18,210
billionaire too,
that he's a billionaire.

2354
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:20,100
Well,
they said this is what they said.

2355
01:57:20,101 --> 01:57:22,530
I don't know,
but it's in that vein.

2356
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:23,431
It's like,
well,

2357
01:57:23,431 --> 01:57:24,264
he did get so many people to vote for 
trump when he said that stuff about 

2358
01:57:27,841 --> 01:57:30,630
people are angry and they don't think he
did it on purpose.

2359
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:35,750
I think a lot of people credit him for 
voting for trump for that speech.

2360
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:36,933
Well,
I'm sure my friend said maybe he's a 

2361
01:57:39,181 --> 01:57:41,090
double agent,
which I don't think he.

2362
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:44,910
I think this is one of the things that 
happens when it's like when,

2363
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:49,970
when when you give people that much 
suppression and you,

2364
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:53,660
you try to indoctrinate people into 
thinking a certain way,

2365
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:54,523
there's going to be people that 
resistant a large help sell and seems 

2366
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:57,813
larger and larger,
but freedom of thought is the basis of 

2367
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:03,360
this country.
It's not freedom of speech or freedom of

2368
01:58:03,361 --> 01:58:07,680
religion and freedom of expression,
the second amendment,

2369
01:58:07,770 --> 01:58:08,603
those are symptoms of freedom of thought
and it did good to consume endless 

2370
01:58:14,851 --> 01:58:19,851
propaganda and never have it broken down
or a or debated or pointed out that it's

2371
01:58:22,021 --> 01:58:22,854
fault.
There is an issue when you're only 

2372
01:58:25,351 --> 01:58:26,184
getting one side of the argument and the
people that are controlling the media 

2373
01:58:28,711 --> 01:58:32,610
only want that one side expressed.
That is a problem.

2374
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,073
Yeah,
and the thing too that right now in 

2375
01:58:35,371 --> 01:58:39,510
terms of wing version of it,
well because they won't let it happen,

2376
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:41,010
but who's they?
You know,

2377
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:42,070
people that are in charge

2378
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,410
of programming the networks,
they don't want that.

2379
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:47,740
It,
it seemed to always lean left.

2380
01:58:47,741 --> 01:58:52,741
I mean technologically oriented 
companies and corporations always almost

2381
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:56,350
invariably lean left.
Why do you think that is?

2382
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:58,510
They're smart,
they're educated,

2383
01:58:58,570 --> 01:59:02,430
they're fresh out of college.
The colleges are indoctrinating leftwing

2384
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:03,303
kids and you know,
you have a vast majority of professors 

2385
01:59:06,461 --> 01:59:09,910
at universities all across the country 
that identify as Democrats.

2386
01:59:10,050 --> 01:59:10,883
Right?
So this is the indoctrination they get 

2387
01:59:12,701 --> 01:59:15,300
from people that they respect deeply and
that they're learning from.

2388
01:59:15,301 --> 01:59:19,390
And there's also an understanding that 
this is the way you advance,

2389
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,180
you know,
and then when someone comes out that has

2390
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:23,014
anything diminish,
you didn't think that it has a brain 

2391
01:59:26,381 --> 01:59:27,214
center that'll coordinate.
It's not coordinated in terms of the 

2392
01:59:30,521 --> 01:59:31,354
government.
I think what's happening in the 

2393
01:59:32,621 --> 01:59:35,050
universities is you've get people that 
are,

2394
01:59:35,051 --> 01:59:35,884
first of all,
they're existing in this bizarre glass 

2395
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,893
walled garden where they,
they go to universities to get 

2396
01:59:45,071 --> 01:59:47,860
indoctrinated into this left wing 
cultures and then they start teaching at

2397
01:59:47,861 --> 01:59:48,410
university.

2398
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:49,900
So they never get out into the real 
world.

2399
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:50,913
And then they teach children these 
thoughts and ideas and then most of the 

2400
01:59:54,401 --> 01:59:56,710
kids leave and they take these ideas 
somewhere else.

2401
01:59:56,830 --> 02:00:00,250
And then slowly over time they become 
more moderate.

2402
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:05,280
Most of them do or they,
they reject those ideas and either go to

2403
02:00:05,381 --> 02:00:07,990
the center or go right or some of them 
stay left.

2404
02:00:08,350 --> 02:00:12,790
But when they go into tech companies,
a lot of them go center,

2405
02:00:12,791 --> 02:00:14,890
which is I think probably where sanity 
is.

2406
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:16,023
I think Saturday is somewhere in the 
center and I think discussion is 

2407
02:00:19,151 --> 02:00:19,984
critical.
I have a lot of friends that are 

2408
02:00:20,831 --> 02:00:21,664
Republican.
I have a lot of friends that are 

2409
02:00:22,331 --> 02:00:24,730
liberal,
there's nothing wrong with either either

2410
02:00:24,731 --> 02:00:25,564
mindset and the only way we find out 
whether or not we really agree or 

2411
02:00:29,471 --> 02:00:30,304
disagree is we let people express 
themselves and as soon as you suppress 

2412
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:35,860
that kind of expression,
then you run into real problems.

2413
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:39,540
That's absolutely right.
And that's what I wanted on my show that

2414
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:41,560
I would show that there was a,
uh,

2415
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:46,510
a trump lover and a trump hater in the 
same house and they managed to deal with

2416
02:00:46,511 --> 02:00:48,400
it and get on with it.
That's a great,

2417
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:49,503
that's a great premise for a show.
And it was one of the reasons why I 

2418
02:00:51,311 --> 02:00:54,640
think people loved it so much is because
there was that conflict.

2419
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:58,870
And because look,
people can love a lovable curmudgeon.

2420
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:01,960
People can love someone who has ideas 
that they disagree with.

2421
02:01:01,961 --> 02:01:02,794
People can love someone who lives with 
someone who has a completely opposing 

2422
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:08,560
opinion.
They figure it out and they get along.

2423
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:10,210
That's fine.
That's great.

2424
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:12,810
That's great.
And my boyfriend,

2425
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:15,130
my boyfriend said,
you have a mistake,

2426
02:01:15,131 --> 02:01:17,800
is that you put a cramp in the hate 
business.

2427
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:20,260
I don't think that's the case.
I think that just you,

2428
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:22,540
just you,
you became a target.

2429
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:25,300
You fucked up.
They were happy from the beginning.

2430
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:27,820
I don't think they really wanted me to 
come back.

2431
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:28,713
I think there's a certain amount of that
when they found out that you're a trump 

2432
02:01:30,671 --> 02:01:35,290
supporter and then the show became 
successful and Donald Trump loved it and

2433
02:01:35,291 --> 02:01:36,124
then trump supporters.
Lafayette was a trouble maker and a big 

2434
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:39,710
mouth.
They've always thought that,

2435
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:40,040
well,

2436
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:40,873
you're a comic.
I know and everybody remembers when you 

2437
02:01:42,921 --> 02:01:45,800
sang the national anthem and grabbed 
your crotch and spit on the ground.

2438
02:01:45,870 --> 02:01:48,680
I remember that.
I do that.

2439
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:52,910
When you do that gastric bypass thing,
is that something they can reverse?

2440
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:56,360
They could reverse it,
but what the hell?

2441
02:01:56,361 --> 02:01:58,130
Then I'll wait.
Hundred books.

2442
02:01:58,131 --> 02:02:00,780
You really don't.
You wouldn't,

2443
02:02:01,710 --> 02:02:05,030
would you just everything.
Oh fuck.

2444
02:02:05,031 --> 02:02:05,864
Yeah,
that's all I had it because I couldn't 

2445
02:02:08,151 --> 02:02:10,700
stop talking about addiction.
Impulsive,

2446
02:02:10,701 --> 02:02:11,780
right?
Oh yeah.

2447
02:02:11,781 --> 02:02:14,360
All Day long.
Eclairs what have you.

2448
02:02:16,230 --> 02:02:19,100
It was great.
I hate those goddamn things.

2449
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:22,130
Claire's no got gastric bypass 
surgeries.

2450
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:24,390
A lot of people.
Yeah,

2451
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:25,273
they do,
but I just wish there was a better way 

2452
02:02:27,250 --> 02:02:28,083
just because it fucks up your nutrient 
absorption abilities like you were 

2453
02:02:30,351 --> 02:02:31,840
talking about.
Yeah,

2454
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:33,650
I mean I've heard that from several 
people.

2455
02:02:33,651 --> 02:02:37,010
I know guys who have gotten in their 
mental state.

2456
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:38,390
Yeah,
I'm sure.

2457
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:39,433
Oh,
for sure.

2458
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:41,560
A lot of it has to do with the.
The,

2459
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,100
the health of your,
you know,

2460
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:44,390
your,
your body,

2461
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:48,140
your ability to absorb nutrients affects
everything.

2462
02:02:48,141 --> 02:02:50,480
Your mood,
your energy levels,

2463
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:51,573
everything.
You mean food doesn't get in there the 

2464
02:02:53,091 --> 02:02:54,060
right way.
No,

2465
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:59,350
I just lay in bed till they called for 
me enough to stumble in and do my thing.

2466
02:02:59,781 --> 02:03:03,040
Go back to bed.
I just had no energy in Brazil.

2467
02:03:03,090 --> 02:03:05,570
Why don't you do something like this?
Like this,

2468
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:06,793
this conversation with these.
You could do this on your time whenever 

2469
02:03:10,251 --> 02:03:11,084
you want to do it without anybody 
telling you what to say or what not to 

2470
02:03:14,421 --> 02:03:17,200
say without any executives,
without anybody to fire you.

2471
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:22,900
You Diy Youtube,
they kick you off everything they could,

2472
02:03:23,271 --> 02:03:25,730
but I don't think they would.
And on top of that,

2473
02:03:25,731 --> 02:03:27,200
you could do it off of your own website.

2474
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:29,270
You could do it on Roseanne Barr Dot 
com.

2475
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:30,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

2476
02:03:31,850 --> 02:03:35,090
I'm always afraid they'll come.
I just feel like,

2477
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:35,924
hey,
this the time of my life from 66 is 

2478
02:03:38,271 --> 02:03:40,040
probably the time for me to just lay 
low.

2479
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:42,350
Does stand up sometimes and that's a 
great idea.

2480
02:03:43,180 --> 02:03:44,420
That's even better.
Yeah.

2481
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:47,990
Go do that then and show us some of my 
farming videos,

2482
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:49,653
listen to people like to know about how 
to grow food and I'm really good at 

2483
02:03:52,071 --> 02:03:52,904
growing food.
When you do stand up and you go on a 

2484
02:03:54,711 --> 02:03:55,544
tour,
I think it's going to be hugely 

2485
02:03:56,601 --> 02:03:58,370
successful.
I really do.

2486
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:59,323
I think people are going to come out in 
droves and I think it's going to be 

2487
02:04:00,531 --> 02:04:04,130
awesome and I think once you get your 
legs under you and you start doing a few

2488
02:04:04,131 --> 02:04:07,050
shows and get things cracking again,
you'd be like the Rosanna.

2489
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,120
Do you be crushing it?

2490
02:04:08,450 --> 02:04:12,860
I was crushing it.
I have to say in my tour of Canada,

2491
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:17,060
I was crushing.
It was a blast I had.

2492
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:19,130
Oh my God,
I just had the most fun,

2493
02:04:19,131 --> 02:04:23,150
you know,
get like 90 minutes of beautiful control

2494
02:04:23,151 --> 02:04:24,230
over,
you know,

2495
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:25,131
bing,
bing,

2496
02:04:25,131 --> 02:04:25,900
bing,
and I,

2497
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:29,330
I've got like a big laugh every 90 
seconds and beautiful,

2498
02:04:29,331 --> 02:04:32,150
you know,
I tailor it and craft it and love it.

2499
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:37,410
Love the people that come out to see me.
Then five diverse crowd too,

2500
02:04:37,411 --> 02:04:38,700
which is great.
Well,

2501
02:04:38,710 --> 02:04:39,543
I bet it'd be even more diverse now 
while it's going to be way better I 

2502
02:04:41,731 --> 02:04:42,564
think,
because I'm going to really start 

2503
02:04:43,261 --> 02:04:44,094
talking about the real me,
such as my abhorrence and fear of 

2504
02:04:47,011 --> 02:04:49,560
serpents.
Serpents.

2505
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:50,870
Oh yeah.
I always have been.

2506
02:04:50,910 --> 02:04:53,200
Don't go to Florida now.
I won't,

2507
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:57,340
don't go to the swamps for sure.
You heard about what's going on there?

2508
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:01,470
What with people releasing pythons all 
know over decades.

2509
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:04,740
You didn't know.
Florida is overrun with pythons.

2510
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:05,633
Oh my God.
Non Native Pythons because people 

2511
02:05:07,561 --> 02:05:10,350
released them as pets and then they 
moved to the swamps and bread.

2512
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:11,940
Yeah,
they've eaten everything.

2513
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:16,500
There's almost no mammals in the swamps.
Oh my God.

2514
02:05:16,501 --> 02:05:19,590
Said 99 percent of all raccoons are 
gone.

2515
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:20,603
We couldn't find any marsh rabbits.
They couldn't find any bobcat's and the 

2516
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:27,340
pythons and started eating alligators.
Oh,

2517
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:31,020
thousands of them out there.
Say the world's gone nuts.

2518
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:33,270
Crazy.
Stay away from Florida.

2519
02:05:33,870 --> 02:05:34,441
I,
well,

2520
02:05:34,441 --> 02:05:37,200
I had A.
I had a turtle that kind of felt.

2521
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:38,190
Are we done?
No,

2522
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:40,350
I mean we can be done or we can keep 
going.

2523
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:42,480
Well,
I had this turtle that fell in love with

2524
02:05:42,481 --> 02:05:44,690
me wanting to meet with me and Hawaii.
You know,

2525
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:46,080
it's so weird.
Now.

2526
02:05:46,081 --> 02:05:49,530
This is true.
I'm really afraid of serpents.

2527
02:05:49,530 --> 02:05:50,520
Okay.
So,

2528
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:51,393
uh,
so I go in the ocean there and my 

2529
02:05:54,181 --> 02:05:55,050
friends,
they're like,

2530
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:58,200
don't touch the turtles.
There's a $5,000

2531
02:05:58,950 --> 02:06:03,180
fine or something.
You don't touch those big old things.

2532
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:05,010
Sound like,
you know,

2533
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,330
like I say,
I'm a Jew.

2534
02:06:06,331 --> 02:06:07,860
So as soon as I hear that,
I'm like,

2535
02:06:07,861 --> 02:06:09,000
yeah,
well fuck them.

2536
02:06:09,001 --> 02:06:11,640
I'm catching it.
So I did.

2537
02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:12,803
And then it turned,
it went and started swimming around me 

2538
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:16,883
and then it went in this big circle and 
it's head came out of the water in it 

2539
02:06:20,551 --> 02:06:22,110
side.
I me,

2540
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:24,660
I was like,
oh Christ,

2541
02:06:24,661 --> 02:06:27,390
it's the serpent.
I've been afraid of my own life.

2542
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:30,330
And he chased me onto the shore.
She goes,

2543
02:06:30,331 --> 02:06:33,780
that's why we don't touch the turtles,
because they bond with you.

2544
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:36,410
Like this guy wants me to.
Merriam.

2545
02:06:37,490 --> 02:06:38,820
Yeah.
If you touch them,

2546
02:06:38,821 --> 02:06:40,650
they like you.
They're like,

2547
02:06:40,651 --> 02:06:45,651
hey,
she'll go for it as a terrifying.

2548
02:06:47,610 --> 02:06:50,100
I've seen them in the water.
They're fucking cool to look at.

2549
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:51,223
Their swimming are awesome.
They're like a little Volkswagen with 

2550
02:06:53,521 --> 02:06:54,354
these four paddles,
serpent head coming out and like this 

2551
02:06:57,630 --> 02:07:00,140
where they look.
So my,

2552
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:04,050
that's how I left it locked eyes with.
Yeah,

2553
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:07,370
he did like this side by side.

2554
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:11,310
They go side.
I'll.

2555
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:12,153
No,
no,

2556
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:15,750
it was terrible to think of.
Terrifying.

2557
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:18,030
Yeah.
I've never gotten back in that water.

2558
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:23,580
Well yeah I could see where that would 
be a problem and I have a lot of serpent

2559
02:07:23,581 --> 02:07:24,414
things.
And also like when I see people I can 

2560
02:07:26,341 --> 02:07:29,340
see if they're a serpent or not.
You know how they say the Reptilian.

2561
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:31,900
Like I told my kids this the hardest 
thing ever.

2562
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:35,370
Type Shit.
Well I really do see them now.

2563
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:36,280
I sort

2564
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,470
of believe him.
He's gone down a rabbit hole.

2565
02:07:38,471 --> 02:07:41,800
That guy.
It's more like a,

2566
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:46,210
like a gopher hole somewhere real deep 
into the core of the earth.

2567
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:50,860
But he talks about that stuff anymore.
Now he kinda laid it back.

2568
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:52,960
But that's because I confronted him.
Dude,

2569
02:07:52,961 --> 02:07:55,030
you just lost it.
Yeah,

2570
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:59,730
well that's what I was doing on twitter 
too as a DM and people going,

2571
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:01,260
you've lost it.
Yeah.

2572
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:02,990
It's fun.
Like I did it.

2573
02:08:02,991 --> 02:08:03,824
And so I used to do these,
a faithful or crank phone calls before 

2574
02:08:08,021 --> 02:08:13,021
they got that star 69 and I was married 
to what's his face then the Elf.

2575
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:18,940
And uh,
he came in the room there and he told me

2576
02:08:18,941 --> 02:08:23,941
he stopped doing it and he looked at my 
address book and I was,

2577
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:30,390
I was calling a general Schwarzkopf to 
do it to him and he's like,

2578
02:08:30,851 --> 02:08:34,180
you don't crank called general work 
because I had all these numbers.

2579
02:08:35,410 --> 02:08:36,370
Anyway.
So,

2580
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:38,170
uh,
what was I saying?

2581
02:08:38,970 --> 02:08:40,950
Yeah,
I used to do that,

2582
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:43,680
but then I went to the DM,
you know,

2583
02:08:43,681 --> 02:08:46,210
on,
that's the way people like,

2584
02:08:46,270 --> 02:08:48,460
just get them riled up that way.
Just go,

2585
02:08:48,461 --> 02:08:49,840
come on,
you're losing it.

2586
02:08:50,330 --> 02:08:51,163
You will have David [inaudible] said 
that like all the big major world 

2587
02:08:54,131 --> 02:08:54,964
figures,
really secretly Reptilian reptilian 

2588
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:59,620
shape shifters and shit,
and I told my kids,

2589
02:08:59,621 --> 02:09:00,454
here's what I told my kids,
just the hardest thing I'll ever tell 

2590
02:09:02,891 --> 02:09:03,724
you,
but,

2591
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:07,600
and I didn't know so I couldn't help but
at the time,

2592
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:13,380
but I recently found out that your dad 
is reptilian joke,

2593
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:19,930
but sort of a joke,
but they are half a million,

2594
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:23,200
but I can see like people becoming the 
reptile,

2595
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:26,290
like I'll see them and their head goes 
up like this,

2596
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:28,900
like on tv,
their head,

2597
02:09:28,901 --> 02:09:29,734
their neck goes out like this and then 
the tongue comes out on the corner to 

2598
02:09:32,411 --> 02:09:35,170
let go up like that.
They do it.

2599
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:40,200
I see it on tv all the time.
I see that all them devil worshipers.

2600
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:43,690
Who Do you go to?
Those devil worship parties here they're

2601
02:09:43,691 --> 02:09:47,290
talking about and Hollywood is devil 
worship to a wedding.

2602
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:49,480
Was it a devil worship?
What is his name?

2603
02:09:49,481 --> 02:09:50,690
Anton Levay.
Sorry.

2604
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:55,030
Was a devil worship for Napa.
Like motherfucker,

2605
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,700
like people call me a Satan worshiper 
now because of it.

2606
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:59,050
Oh my God.
And

2607
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:01,290
Dunkin.
This was like 15 years ago,

2608
02:10:01,291 --> 02:10:02,124
my friend Duncan used to have this 
puppet called Little Hobo and he would 

2609
02:10:05,941 --> 02:10:06,810
do this,
uh,

2610
02:10:07,050 --> 02:10:07,883
this hilarious bit at the end of his 
comedy show where Little Hobo was his 

2611
02:10:11,731 --> 02:10:15,600
grandfather's puppet and his,
his grandfather died.

2612
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:16,613
And,
uh,

2613
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:19,830
his grandfather's last wish with that.
He bring little Hobo on stage with them.

2614
02:10:19,831 --> 02:10:22,050
One more time in the pub would come to 
life.

2615
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,000
There's,
there's Daca with little Hobo.

2616
02:10:24,270 --> 02:10:25,920
Little Hobo was this fucked up look at 
pub.

2617
02:10:25,921 --> 02:10:28,130
It was a hilarious bit.
It's funny.

2618
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:31,230
Anton [inaudible] grandson.
Is that who it was?

2619
02:10:31,231 --> 02:10:34,310
Their son was getting married as Duncan 
to perform

2620
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:37,100
at his party.
So me and a bunch of my friends all went

2621
02:10:37,101 --> 02:10:40,670
to see Dunkin perform at this bizarre 
Satanists party.

2622
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,830
It was very strange.
It was in Hollywood.

2623
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:46,250
It was like there's a concert and hang 
the third,

2624
02:10:46,251 --> 02:10:50,300
Hank Williams a third performed there.
And it was kind of fun,

2625
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:52,560
but it was bizarre.
And uh,

2626
02:10:52,580 --> 02:10:53,413
so there's like a picture with me and 
the guy and people saying with Satan 

2627
02:10:56,421 --> 02:10:59,440
worshiper now you're not.
Definitely not.

2628
02:11:01,610 --> 02:11:04,130
Oh my God.
You look like a St Louis should have got

2629
02:11:04,131 --> 02:11:04,964
a.
someone's hands you the gun on the left 

2630
02:11:07,071 --> 02:11:09,830
with the hair.
Oh my God.

2631
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,800
That's me.
You got to get some better glasses.

2632
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:16,640
Bama.
I can't tell them exactly like me,

2633
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:20,990
but anyway.
No,

2634
02:11:20,991 --> 02:11:22,310
I promise you no,
no.

2635
02:11:22,311 --> 02:11:23,930
Satan worshiping.
No,

2636
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:27,080
no worshiping period.
There's some real.

2637
02:11:27,081 --> 02:11:30,080
I'm sure crazy people out here that 
definitely really are.

2638
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:32,990
Yeah.
I'm glad you didn't stay in with them.

2639
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:34,663
I went to one stupid fucking party 
because my friend Duncan fucking Duncan 

2640
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,270
getting in trouble.
You son of a bitch.

2641
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:42,740
Um,
what else?

2642
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:45,800
What were we just talking about when we 
were talking about Satan worshipers?

2643
02:11:45,801 --> 02:11:46,910
You were saying something.
Oh,

2644
02:11:46,911 --> 02:11:50,410
lizard people.
So who's the lizard people whose.

2645
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:54,370
Well you just say nobody's name.
Okay.

2646
02:11:54,820 --> 02:11:57,460
But I'll tell you,
I can't say,

2647
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:03,170
but uh,
if you really take a hard long look when

2648
02:12:03,171 --> 02:12:04,004
they're talking to me some names for 
that net going up and they had twisting 

2649
02:12:08,660 --> 02:12:10,940
and then the term coming out corner.
Okay.

2650
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,863
I'll keep an eye on.
So you're saying I'll keep an eye out 

2651
02:12:17,211 --> 02:12:18,670
for it.
We'll listen.

2652
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:19,820
Roseanne.
Thank you.

2653
02:12:20,230 --> 02:12:22,310
This was a lot of fun.
It was fun.

2654
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,140
I think people got a chance to see the 
real you.

2655
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:25,243
Well,
I just want to say to everybody out 

2656
02:12:26,361 --> 02:12:28,580
there before you kicked me out of here.
Hey,

2657
02:12:28,581 --> 02:12:29,414
I love everybody.
I believe in one law for all people and 

2658
02:12:32,511 --> 02:12:33,370
uh,
you know,

2659
02:12:33,371 --> 02:12:36,710
I'm not any fucking backwoods idiot.
Thank you.

2660
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:37,723
You're not a racist by any stretch of 
the imagination of all people and I'm 

2661
02:12:40,311 --> 02:12:42,170
happy you're doing standup again because
like I said,

2662
02:12:42,171 --> 02:12:44,570
I think you're one of the best ever.
So sweet.

2663
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:45,830
Damn,
that makes me happy.

2664
02:12:45,831 --> 02:12:47,160
Thank you.
I really do.

2665
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:48,650
I'm glad you're doing it.
Thank you.

2666
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:50,450
Roseanne Barr.
Ladies and gentlemen.

2667
02:12:51,550 --> 02:12:52,383
Thanks Joe.
