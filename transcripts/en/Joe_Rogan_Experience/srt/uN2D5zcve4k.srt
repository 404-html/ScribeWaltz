1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,010
The Joe Rogan experience,
that's not good for.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,411
Well,
no,

3
00:00:03,411 --> 00:00:04,610
it's terrible for you.
It's,

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,840
and what it is,
is it's a,

5
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:09,260
it's a game.
It's like the office is a game and

6
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:12,770
there's very specific rules where this,
when the game starts in the beginning of

7
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:16,700
the day,
there's a boss and suddenly this person

8
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:20,510
who's just like you has authority over
you and can control,

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,120
basically controls your life and the
food for your kids.

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,110
And so you have to speak in a certain
language dictated by the corporation.

11
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:32,060
It's this terrible fucking game that
people forget as a game and they begin

12
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:32,631
to think,
oh no,

13
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:35,390
this is the way you're supposed to act.
This is real life.

14
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:37,760
And that's when you get like that B of a
song.

15
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:40,730
Did you ever see that b of a song,
the Bank of America,

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,820
do you ever see that?
It's like somebody filmed this corporate

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,890
merger announcement of a merger between
B of a and a and another bank.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,980
And it's a guy saying to you to choose
one,

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,190
uh,
this song that he wrote about Bank of

20
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,290
America.
And it is what it will make your

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,810
eyeballs roll back into your head with
such existential horror.

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,550
Seeing these brainwash drone who's
obviously spent like a week writing the

23
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:12,280
lyrics to the song and is passionately.
Oh my gosh,

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,940
Natalie,
I'm singing the lyrics to how Great Bank

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,670
of America is as a corporation.
I think we should be able to play this

26
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:24,671
on pile you as a believer.
I was a corporate video that was made by

27
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:26,420
Bank of America,
right?

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,060
That was sent out to his employees,
know it.

29
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:34,061
Somebody had a camera out during this
like moment where some kiss ass who know

30
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,330
how to play guitar.

31
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,670
And everybody in the audience is clearly
like,

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,560
they seem uncomfortable to me.
They're just like,

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,840
oh fuck.
You know what it reminds me of?

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,410
It reminds me of a cult.
It's a cult.

35
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:53,410
The feeling there is that of a people
who've gotten absorbed into a cult,

36
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:58,220
and that's the only way to put it.
It's like they believe crazy shit that

37
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:03,050
is only even known by a relatively small
group of people and it's their entire

38
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:08,051
lives banking the bank of America way,
the way that we do business.

39
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,660
He's singing about the way they do
business and it's kind of obscure

40
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:14,030
banking terms in the song.
Really,

41
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:17,540
really terrible.
That sounds fucking awesome.

42
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,860
This can be found on youtube under bank
of America.

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,260
Sings Youtube.
I just want to say before you press

44
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,240
play,
I'm looking forward to this almost as

45
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,010
much so I'm looking forward to the new
Conan

46
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,290
some guests who have been so impressed
with your results to date and they've

47
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:43,951
listened to the plans being described
today and continue to be excited about

48
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:48,790
what's going to be the card business
today and beyond,

49
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,440
and that is Jim Dubois,
who is the consumer market exec for the

50
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:57,310
Manhattan market.
What's all this nonsense?

51
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,130
Who is one of our banking center manager

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,220
is a long winded Fela song together for
you,

53
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,030
so sound together for you.
Oh,

54
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,050
we miss those guys names,
which is probably for the best.

55
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,850
We don't want to diss them.

56
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,090
Well,
this is.

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,880
We'll go full
screen.

58
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,260
Oh No.

59
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,300
Now that we're the same.

60
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,230
Sue.
Great companies come together.

61
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,260
Mbn.
Hey,

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,360
it's bigger
and one bank,

63
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,460
one con,
one name.

64
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:55,461
That's the only
one spirit.

65
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,430
We get the sheriff who eating salt too.

66
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,550
Yay.

67
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,710
By the way,
is also like a 40 year old bald guy that

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,860
doesn't look anything like hipness that
he's like Larry.

69
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:16,650
David's younger brother going to do the
whole thing.

70
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,660
Yes please.
The cowboys.

71
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,630
Cowboys,
all you know this.

72
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,640
See,

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,820
this is amazing and incredible,
Suzanne.

74
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,990
Yeah.
Or is Nascar more your speed?

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,290
Everybody's got it back.
Got Coffee.

76
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,600
The guy's got a good voice.
He's got a real good voice.

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,990
She doesn't have a soul.
This is the kind of songs that you say

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,650
when you don't have weed in your life
regularly.

79
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:53,650
Piss testing.
You see this guy gets pissed.

80
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,230
Tested on the regular.
This is what sobriety gets here.

81
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,510
I can't do that.
No,

82
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,140
I can't sing like that.
It's great in his church choir.

83
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,590
I bet he kills it in the church choir.
Do you think he wants to dig?

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,980
You already had it thinking it comes to
me.

85
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,590
I feel like I feel like I'm going to be
honest.

86
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:18,520
I feel like someone could fuck his wife,
so mainly I feel like there's an opening

87
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:19,570
there.
You know what I'm saying?

88
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,980
Yeah.
Probably have you looking into this.

89
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,850
He's got more of a btk killer,
btk killer throws on underwear.

90
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:34,270
It strangles boys
on women's underwear.

91
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,680
Whoever this guy is into the favor of
this guys,

92
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:42,130
With dyspnea and we don't mean it.
You really would like to do is we will

94
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,060
offer you a hug and some weed and you're
very pixelated on the video,

95
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,610
so we're just judging by pixilations
mostly.

96
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,061
Well,
I mean,

97
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,390
I don't know.
I mean I think you got.

98
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,440
Maybe I'm just an Asshole,
but adult.

99
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,760
We're totally assholes.
I don't feel empathy for that guy.

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,590
He's just a guy now.
The banker.

101
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,450
He's got a job at supporting his kids.
Listen,

102
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,490
satanist.
He's a member of the church,

103
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:04,640
of course,
of the Corporate Church of Lucifer.

104
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,630
He's singing idol.
Some devil idle.

105
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,970
Fuck him.
Ah,

106
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,590
people he's exploiting.
Just imagine working in a cubicle next

107
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,620
to that.
Cocksucker is writing a shitty song and

108
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:23,621
he's bringing you in and running it body
while he farts is comfort and you're

109
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,030
having a smell.
That guy's,

110
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,100
this guy's a missions.
He's a human slug.

111
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,570
I hate them.
I just know he torments.

112
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,150
All right.
I just know he torments underlings.

113
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,200
That's why I haven't.

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,080
No,
so yes,

115
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,120
I see.
I saw him as like a fatherly figure in

116
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:49,180
the office,
gives out a lot of hugs,

117
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,700
but always had a desire to be a singer
and then this is a,

118
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,440
this is what he put together and then a
few people have his office.

119
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:58,510
We're proud of them.
A bunch were very embarrassed.

120
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:01,630
It's very embarrassing and it's going to
be a lot of talking behind closed doors,

121
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,950
but there's a few girls,
like a few chubby secretaries to thought

122
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,793
he did.
Awesome.

123
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,941
Oh yeah.
I mean I,

124
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:10,010
I don't.
I'm sure that there is other brainwashed

125
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:14,010
drones.
Carl did such an excellent job.

126
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,530
I really felt our higher standards
coming through his songs.

127
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,050
He really represents the B of a higher
standard

128
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,740
moment where he starts singing one bank,
you know,

129
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,260
like coming together.
He's like,

130
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,430
when you realized that he really doing
this is really going full emotions about

131
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:39,030
a bank passion.
It's his life and his team.

132
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,460
Passionate about being on team building.

133
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,320
Yeah,
and they made a merger.

134
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,480
You didn't even know.
He gets kind of nasty later on in the

135
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:47,090
song.
Where he kinda does is another bank.

136
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,450
The one of the lyrics is what's in your
pocket?

137
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:58,430
It's not capital one.
That's a lyric dissing capital one.

138
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,950
Does capital one,
would you fuck capitol?

139
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,010
Fuck all of them,
right?

140
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,830
Yeah.
We need a system.

141
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,960
I don't have a pro.
I mean,

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,090
whatever.
With the coins,

143
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,530
Bro.
Big Sorta here.

144
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,453
Works Online,
right?

145
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,700
Yeah.
