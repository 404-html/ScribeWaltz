1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,880
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,080
alright.
Right.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,800
Live.
What's up man?

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:11,510
How are you?
Hey,

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm pretty good.
I'm excited.

6
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,860
I walked in on a pool game that was a 
barely squeaked it out.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,470
It was a very nice shot to,
to end it though.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,240
That's the way to end it.
So,

9
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:23,370
uh,
I've been reading your book man tribe.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,460
I really enjoy it.
It's really good and it's,

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,580
it's so,
uh,

12
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:29,310
it resonates.
It's very interesting.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,400
I will into the first chapter.
I wanted to move in with the native 

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,100
Americans.
It was such a,

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,020
I mean it was one of the more 
interesting aspects of it was uh,

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,160
something that I didn't know about,
which was the European settlers that had

17
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:48,930
been kidnapped and were living with the 
native Americans and then when they were

18
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:51,270
rescued,
many of them wanted to go back.

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,730
Yeah.
Or they would go into hiding so they 

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:56,730
wouldn't have to be repatriated to 
colonial society.

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,360
They wanted to stay with their adopted 
tribes.

22
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:01,430
And then there was also a lot of,
um,

23
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,690
a lot of young white people,
particularly white men and young women 

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,621
too,
who basically absconded across the 

25
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:10,830
frontier into tribal society.
A,

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,210
they fled white society,
they didn't like it,

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,910
and,
and as Benjamin Franklin pointed out,

28
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:20,911
we have lots of call colonial colonial's
fleeing to the Indians and we have not 

29
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:24,910
one example of an Indian as they were 
called fleeing to white society.

30
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,250
Yeah,
that was one of the more fascinating 

31
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,250
aspects of it.
I didn't anticipate that.

32
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,110
I thought that there would be a lot of 
native Americans,

33
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:32,900
so it'd be like,
wow,

34
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,780
this is a way better look at all the 
food looking at the houses.

35
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:35,990
And

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,800
I mean they had plenty of food,
you know,

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,320
whatever their success,
success,

38
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,970
very successful society.
In fact they were,

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,620
they had better nutrition than the 
whites did a more varied diet,

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,540
um,
and a much,

41
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,840
much more egalitarian society than 
colonial society.

42
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,110
That was also interesting about it.
Um,

43
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,270
when you were talking about the women 
that had moved in with the native 

44
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,410
Americans and we're expressing how much 
more freedom they experienced.

45
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,430
Yeah.
I mean,

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,750
Indian Society,
native society wasn't crushed by a 

47
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,190
Christian morality.
So you could divorce,

48
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:11,140
you could marry as a woman,
you can marry whom you wanted.

49
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,030
You could get divorced.
You can do whatever you wanted.

50
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,680
It was very,
very galatarian.

51
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,270
What they've shown is that,
um,

52
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,910
the in societies where everyone is 
necessary for food production,

53
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,130
food production,
uh,

54
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,780
everyone more or less equal.
And in an agrarian societies,

55
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,240
agricultural societies,
industrial societies,

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,490
you have large segments of the 
population.

57
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,010
Often women who are not involved in food
production,

58
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,980
they are involved in reproduction.
And so they're,

59
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,470
um,
equality goes

60
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,380
down.
Wow.

61
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,580
It's just,
it's almost like society as we've 

62
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,481
created over the last couple of hundred 
years is almost totally incompatible 

63
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:57,040
with,
with human genetics or with the human 

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,000
body or the human spirit or whatever.

65
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,980
Well,
if you look at,

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,500
I mean,
genetics is complicated.

67
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,730
I mean,
obviously on some level,

68
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:05,560
industrial,
modern society is very successful.

69
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,720
We have 7 billion of us.
Um,

70
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,220
uh,
but as wealth goes up in a society,

71
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,490
as modernity goes up in a society,
the suicide rate goes up,

72
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,090
the depression rate goes up,
schizophrenia goes up in urban 

73
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,280
environments.
Um,

74
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,790
they're not good for the human psyche.
We are designed.

75
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,810
We evolve the lave in groups of 30,
40 people in a harsh environment,

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,420
totally reliant on one another.
For survival,

77
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,770
a,
that creates a huge amount of equality 

78
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:36,770
within a group and loyalty within a 
group.

79
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,690
That's what we are designed for.
Genetically.

80
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,640
A modern society allows the individual 
to be independent from the group,

81
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,470
which is in some ways a great 
liberation,

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,380
uh,
and other ways it can lead to a profound

83
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:49,750
alienation and depression.
Yeah,

84
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,680
it's,
it's just a confusing thing.

85
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:55,950
It seems for people to be amongst so 
many people,

86
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,030
but to be alone.

87
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,280
Yeah.
I mean,

88
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:03,281
we're not wired to be confronted with 
strangers all day long and I live in New

89
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,390
York City and I love New York City,
but all day long you,

90
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,450
you encounter strangers and you don't 
and you don't recognize anybody so you 

91
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,710
can be alone in a crowd,
which is not something that human beings

92
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,440
have experienced until quite recently in
their history.

93
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,910
Yeah.
Um,

94
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,930
that was,
I think one of the more disturbing parts

95
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:28,931
about this idea that these people were 
kidnapped by the native Americans and 

96
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:34,181
wanted to stay with them was that 
whatever that native American life was 

97
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:36,410
like,
however they were living,

98
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,870
that just seemed to just resonate with 
them.

99
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,810
It seemed to,
it seemed to be what was right.

100
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,040
Well,
we're,

101
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,820
we're wired to want to feel like we 
belong to a group.

102
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,290
A native American society was a sexually
quite relaxed.

103
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,910
I was quite a Galitary Ian.
I'm in a hunter gatherer society.

104
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,911
You really can't accumulate wealth very 
well because these societies are often 

105
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:04,501
nomadic,
so you can only accumulate as much 

106
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:04,501
wealth as you can carry,
which isn't much.

107
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:04,830
Um,
and,

108
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,900
and ultimately in societies like that,
as in a platoon in combat,

109
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,830
which is another part of my book,
obviously,

110
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,900
um,
you're,

111
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,460
you're,
you're primarily valued,

112
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,690
valued for your contribution to the 
group.

113
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,720
And that has been lost in modern 
society.

114
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:24,721
People are enormously selfserving.
Capitalism basically instructs us to do 

115
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:24,860
so.
Uh,

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,190
that's a whole other evolutionary 
imperative,

117
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,830
which is also important,
but in our society is way out of whack.

118
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:34,831
So we are wired to serve ourselves and 
we are wired to serve the group and in a

119
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:36,250
healthy society,
those two,

120
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,980
those two are in a dynamic tension with 
each other.

121
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,810
And in ballots,
in modern society,

122
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,300
there really is no group to serve.
Uh,

123
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:48,190
and it leads to a really profound sense 
of meaninglessness for a lot of people.

124
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,190
Cool.

125
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,570
Yeah.
Uh,

126
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:53,840
I also found it pretty fascinating that 
when you were really young you,

127
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,270
when you,
when you were working,

128
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,830
I think you said you were working 
construction,

129
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,160
so it was a,

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,630
I'm trying to remember the story you 
were about to,

131
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,400
can you were just saying that you were 
talking to someone that you're working 

132
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,350
with and they were telling you to slow 
down because some of us,

133
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,570
some of us have to do this for.

134
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,490
That's about it.
Yeah.

135
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,760
I forgot about that story.
Yeah.

136
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,150
Yeah.
I was on a construction crew and it was 

137
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,150
a highway department of my town and you 
know,

138
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,180
a lot of these guys are kind of lifers 
in our department.

139
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,560
Not a particularly challenging job,
um,

140
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,350
in a,
in a sense,

141
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,460
uh,
but you were on your feet all day long 

142
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,460
in the sun or whatever.
And,

143
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,460
and so,
uh,

144
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,460
you know,
I was a young guy and I,

145
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,391
you know,
I wanted to sort of prove my mettle or 

146
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:31,391
whatever I was.
I was,

147
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,750
we were digging a trench and I was 
digging like crazy and a and an older 

148
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,030
guy came up to me,
you know,

149
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,360
he's probably in his sixties and he came
up to me and clapped me on the shoulder.

150
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:37,970
He said,
son,

151
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,860
you want to slow down there,
you know,

152
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,120
why some of us are going to have to do 
this job our whole lives.

153
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,610
And he knew I was a college kid.
He knew I wasn't going to.

154
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,310
Um,
and I said,

155
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,390
just slow down,
you know,

156
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,780
no one needs to work this past.

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,360
It's just a,
it was a really interesting that you 

158
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,320
were longing for something you were 
saying like almost to go wrong.

159
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:03,321
So everybody had a band together,
whether it was a hurricane or something 

160
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,820
and that,
that mundane life of just work and doing

161
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,320
things you don't really want to do.

162
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,750
Well,
I mean,

163
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:13,751
the irony about modern society is that 
is removed hardship and danger from 

164
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:17,621
everyday life and it's in the face of 
hardship and danger that people come to 

165
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:20,630
understand their value to their society 
and there's a,

166
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,220
they get their sense of meaning from 
that.

167
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:24,590
And so what you have is when,
uh,

168
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,480
you know,
during the blitz in London,

169
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,490
for example,
30,000

170
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:33,491
people were killed by German bombs.
It was a horror show over the course of 

171
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:33,491
six months.
It was ghastly,

172
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:37,901
but people are sleeping shoulder to 
shoulder in the tube stations and 

173
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:38,960
putting out fires with bucket brigades 
and digging people out of rubble.

174
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,360
And they were acting as a unified 
society.

175
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,810
And the English government was prepared 
for mass psychiatric casualties because 

176
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,610
as a civilian population getting bombed 
at bets and the opposite happened.

177
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:54,611
Admissions to psych wards went down 
during the blitz and then back up after 

178
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:54,920
the bombing stopped.
And,

179
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,980
um,
and then afterwards it was an enormous 

180
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,460
nostalgia in England for the blitz.
For those days.

181
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm as tragic as they were because 
English society felt other people felt 

182
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,430
like they were together.
Later I was,

183
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:15,431
I went back to Sarajevo where I'd been 
during the siege of Sarajevo in the 

184
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:16,670
early nineties.
And civilians would tell me,

185
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,660
you know,
this is 20 years later,

186
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,950
20 years after the war,
people say,

187
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,140
wow,
a lot of us miss the war because we were

188
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,450
better people back then.
We took care of each other.

189
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,540
I've talked about that with September 
11th.

190
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,190
Um,
I went to New York City.

191
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:33,191
I'm about,
I guess it was maybe six months after 

192
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:33,191
September 11th.
And uh,

193
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:37,670
I was there a couple times and the,
the before September 11th,

194
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,490
after September 11th,
there was a very clear difference in the

195
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:43,220
way people were behaving.
People seem to be more,

196
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,770
more friendly,
more open.

197
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,820
They were really appreciative of first 
responders.

198
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,710
Um,
I was there once in a friend of mine.

199
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,580
She fainted.
And so they called the fire department,

200
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,870
came to check her out.
And,

201
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,990
and when the firemen showed up,
man,

202
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:00,300
you would think fucking superhero showed
up.

203
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,910
It was amazing.
Everybody was so happy to see him.

204
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,390
And it was in stark contrast to the way 
people used to behave and treat each 

205
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,921
other.
And it was directly because of having 

206
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:12,921
experienced this horrific event.

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Well,
adversity produces pro pro social 

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,100
behaviors in people.
Adversity makes people act well.

209
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,320
Uh,
the lack of adversity,

210
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,660
safety and comfort allow people to act 
selfishly.

211
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,790
Uh,
so after nine slash 11,

212
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,910
the suicide rate went down in New York.
Uh,

213
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,220
the violent crime rate went down in New 
York.

214
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:37,990
Vietnam vets reported that their ptsd 
symptoms went down after nine slash 11.

215
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,540
Um,
what happens is people suddenly feel 

216
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,560
that they're needed by their society,
by their people,

217
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,540
and if you feel needed,
you are able to ignore your own personal

218
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:54,541
troubles is when someone in England and 
an efficient and English official said 

219
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,280
during the blitz in London,
he said,

220
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,460
it's amazing.
We have the chronic neurotics of 

221
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:02,460
peacetime driving ambulances.
Um,

222
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,270
and if you think about in terms of 
evolution,

223
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,180
if adversity in danger produced bad 
human behaviors,

224
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,660
we wouldn't be here today.
Another way to say that is we are the 

225
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,310
descendants of the individuals 100,000
years ago who acted well in a crisis.

226
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,580
The people that acted badly to crisis 
and just took care of themselves and 

227
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,100
didn't take care of their people,
their group,

228
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,570
those,
those people,

229
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,660
those groups died out.
It's people,

230
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:28,810
it's groups that encouraged a form of 
altruism itself,

231
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,960
self sacrifice of individuals for the 
group.

232
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,030
During a crisis.
Those groups survive.

233
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,190
That DNA gets passed onto us.

234
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,630
And did you gain a deeper appreciation 
for this because of your time as a war 

235
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,311
journalist?
Did it sort of manifests itself in your 

236
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:46,311
mind because of that?

237
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:46,311
Well,
I,

238
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:51,081
I.
This book came to me and to sort of two 

239
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:51,081
step process.
First of all,

240
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:55,131
when I was young man,
I had a surrogate uncle figure in my 

241
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:58,161
life,
very important person to be named Ellis 

242
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:01,340
Ellis settle.
He was a half Lakota Sioux half Apache 

243
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,490
and he was born in Nineteen,
29 on a wagon out west.

244
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,560
It live an extraordinary life.
He was very,

245
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,360
very educated,
self educated,

246
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,700
and at one point he said to me,
you know,

247
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,180
it's so funny.
All throughout the history of this 

248
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,461
country,
white people were always running off to 

249
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:16,461
join the Indians and the Indians never 
ran off to join the white people.

250
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:17,730
And I filed that away.
In my mind,

251
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:19,410
I kind of liked the idea of it.
I thought it was.

252
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,650
I hoped it was true.
I didn't know if it was true and then 

253
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,500
decades later I was with American 
soldiers on a remote outpost in 

254
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,670
Afghanistan and uh,
called Restrepo and I made a documentary

255
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,070
film by that name with my colleague Tim 
Hetherington,

256
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,650
and there was almost daily combat.

257
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,750
There was no,
no link to the outside world,

258
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,740
no Internet.
There was no electricity for awhile.

259
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,130
They just slept in the dirt.
They got shot at everyday.

260
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,150
We got shot at every day.
Uh,

261
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:48,151
there was no women out there.
There was nothing but combat and 

262
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:49,380
Tarantulas and pallets of water and Mras
and Ammo.

263
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,170
That was it for a year.
Those boys are out there for over a year

264
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,650
and they very psyched to come back to 
Italy where they're based at the end of 

265
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,380
their deployment.
You can imagine that had some pretty 

266
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,380
good parties planned.
But after that died down,

267
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,210
he real depression set in.
And by the time I got caught up with 

268
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,700
them again in Vicenza and interviewed 
them,

269
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,260
many of them said that they wanted to 
go.

270
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,790
They didn't want to come back to 
America.

271
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,940
They wanted to go back out to restrepo.
And it reminded me of what Ellis had 

272
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,541
said and I thought,
what is it that's why is it that no one 

273
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:18,541
wants to come home?

274
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:18,541
Like,
what is it?

275
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,040
And I realized it's not that they,
they want war,

276
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,380
that they're not sociopaths,
that,

277
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:22,660
uh,
you know,

278
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:27,661
like they don't,
they don't want to be out there killing 

279
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:27,730
people and getting shot at.
They missed each other.

280
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,210
They missed the intense communalism of 
life in a platoon on a,

281
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,330
on a remote hilltop in combat.
And um,

282
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,960
and that's an inch and instruct me.
I studied anthropology in college.

283
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,310
Oh my God.
A platoon in combat effectively 

284
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:43,310
reproduces our human evolution,
right?

285
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,281
I mean,
we evolved to live in groups of that 

286
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:47,410
size and in a harsh environment and 
that's what a platoon is.

287
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,680
And so of course it resonated with them,
resonated genetically with them.

288
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,880
And,
um,

289
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:53,000
I gotta say it's tough.
It was,

290
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,660
as it was out there,
there was a weird,

291
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,750
also weird,
I don't quite want to call it a 

292
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,031
euphoria,
but a strange sense of wellbeing out 

293
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:04,780
there that I missed enormously when I 
left as well.

294
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,710
You missed it.
Oh,

295
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,690
enormously.
Yes.

296
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,170
Did you try to rationalize it?
Did you try to,

297
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,200
when did you sit alone with it and try 
to figure out what it was or did you 

298
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,750
just accept it?
I mean,

299
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:17,260
I,
you know,

300
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,210
I've been covering wars since the early 
nineties.

301
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:21,550
I started going to Afghanistan in the 
mid nineties.

302
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,040
Um,
I came back from,

303
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,830
from Restrepo,
you know,

304
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,490
we were in a lot of combat.
I almost,

305
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:30,550
almost killed a couple of times,
so I had some sort of trauma issues.

306
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,440
I mean,
everybody did a,

307
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:37,060
my marriage started to fall apart.
That was not coincidental by the way.

308
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:39,340
I now realized that the timing was 
significant.

309
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,950
Um,
it took me awhile to understand that and

310
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I think and we're real depression and it
took me a while to understand that my 

311
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,081
depression was partly connected to the 
fact that I was no longer part of a 

312
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:52,760
group and,
and a,

313
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,770
but took a long time for me to figure 
that out while I was experiencing all 

314
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:57,770
that.

315
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,610
I just felt like I was in some kind of,
that I was behind bulletproof 

316
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,420
bulletproof plexiglass and I was on the 
inside and everyone I cared about was on

317
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:12,421
the other side of the plexiglass and I 
couldn't reach them that they were 

318
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:13,090
somehow inaccessible to me.
I couldn't hear them,

319
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:18,091
I couldn't touch them.
I was alone in this plexiglass cage and 

320
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:18,910
that's what it sort of felt like.
I was incredibly depressed.

321
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,940
And then Tim,
my good friend and brother and colleague

322
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:26,941
who I made Restrepo with,
he was killed in combat in Libya and 

323
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:28,130
that was the final blow.
I mean,

324
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,070
I really crashed.
My marriage ended.

325
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:31,590
I mean,
I was a real mess for awhile.

326
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,990
How did you pull out of it?
Uh,

327
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,810
I,
you know,

328
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:38,260
I,
you know,

329
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:39,130
I just,
I had a,

330
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,960
a year or so in the wilderness,
I think psychologically and um,

331
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,370
you know,
humans are evolved obviously to deal 

332
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:48,370
with trauma.
I mean,

333
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:48,370
eventually,
I mean,

334
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,131
if trauma was incapacitating to people 
for years or lifetimes,

335
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,220
we wouldn't exist.
Right?

336
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:55,700
I mean,
our,

337
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,460
our,
our,

338
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:57,200
our,
our,

339
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,320
our history as a species involved a huge
amount of trauma.

340
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,920
So we are designed to react to trauma by
protecting ourselves emotionally and 

341
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,660
physically for a certain amount of time 
for some weeks or months,

342
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,720
maybe a year or two,
and then the slowly come out of it and 

343
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:13,720
continue functioning.
That's exactly what happened to me.

344
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,580
What do you do?
Did you get something out of it?

345
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:22,581
I mean,
obviously it's a terrible experience to 

346
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:22,581
be depressed for that long and to go 
through all that.

347
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,900
But did you get some sort of an 
understanding of yourself out of it?

348
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,380
Oh,
absolutely.

349
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:26,770
I mean,
I,

350
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:28,090
I,
I,

351
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,380
um,
some ways,

352
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,520
um,
I mean,

353
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:31,920
I,
my,

354
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,180
my,
my,

355
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,970
my marriage ended,
um,

356
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,540
by,
by,

357
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,880
you know,
moved out of my home,

358
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,310
uh,
was living in a very sort of a thread,

359
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,270
bare existence for awhile.
I sort of gave up everything that,

360
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,880
that made me feel safe and protected in 
the world.

361
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,780
I mean,
financially,

362
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,250
no,
I just sort of happened,

363
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,030
you know,
financially,

364
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,620
emotionally.
Uh,

365
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:55,621
I wasn't doing,
I wasn't working as a reporter for a 

366
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,920
while.
I'd stopped reporting after Tim got 

367
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,860
killed and I just sort of hit the reset 
button on myself as a person.

368
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,680
And,
and,

369
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,630
and I sort of,
um,

370
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,130
when I came back from that I,
I,

371
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,380
I,
the things I added to my life were very 

372
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,380
solid.
Uh,

373
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,380
we're,
we're very,

374
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,190
very good things.
And um,

375
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,770
I sort of started from zero again and 
that really kind of worked.

376
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,130
And um,
and I also stopped.

377
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,790
I mean I didn't have a drinking problem 
but I,

378
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:23,791
but I stopped drinking.
I stopped drinking alcohol and that the 

379
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,470
drinking alcohol I made me,
it made me drink alcohol,

380
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:27,370
made me feel good,
right?

381
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:28,510
I mean,
I'm really happy drunk.

382
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:30,910
And when I was depressed for,
for a bunch of reasons,

383
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:32,350
if I drank,
I felt great.

384
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:34,180
And so there's a real incentive to do 
that.

385
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,780
And I realized that it was depriving me 
of experiencing my actual life.

386
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,120
Like my actual life was filled with some
very tough things at the moment.

387
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,970
And if you self medicate your way 
through them,

388
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,550
you actually,
those things are taken from you.

389
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,160
It's your life,
your life you're going through.

390
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,170
And if they were taking it and I 
realized I might lose the experience of 

391
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,800
these things.
And,

392
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,740
you know,
my ex wife and I are like quick,

393
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,670
good friends now and ended up partly 
because,

394
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,610
um,
I decided to try and experience the loss

395
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:06,190
of the marriage as directly as possible.
And that involved not drinking.

396
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,600
Did you,
during this time of depression,

397
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:13,270
did you consider or did you take any 
antidepressants?

398
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,730
So,
no,

399
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,450
just likewise,
like I,

400
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,720
I,
I mean,

401
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,140
I,
I,

402
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:22,210
I was talking to someone professional 
about how I felt because I was a little 

403
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:22,210
worried about myself.
But,

404
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,710
um,
as I said to her,

405
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,190
I said,
you know,

406
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:27,820
if I was on antidepressants,
it might allow me to accept.

407
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,240
It might make me feel good enough to 
accept a life that isn't really working 

408
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,640
very well.
Yeah,

409
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,360
that's a,
as a person who's not depressed,

410
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,650
it's a very,
uh,

411
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,500
it's a slippery argument for me because 
I,

412
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,820
I'm just an outside observer,
you know,

413
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,840
and when I talked to people that are 
depressed and I always wonder like,

414
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:50,841
how,
how much of what you're doing is life 

415
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:50,841
circumstances,
how much is it actual,

416
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,120
some sort of a mental imbalance,
some sort of a chemical imbalance that 

417
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,310
you just are unfortunately born with.

418
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,450
I mean,
listen,

419
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm not a shrink.
Obviously there are people that 

420
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,040
encountered their first impression is 
teenagers and struggle with a very 

421
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,040
dangerous illness their whole lives.
Yeah.

422
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,920
I'm not talking about that kind of 
depression,

423
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,990
depression.
I don't know why.

424
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:14,991
I mean,
isn't circumstance nurture genetics 

425
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:14,991
involved in that?
For me,

426
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:14,991
I,
you know,

427
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:19,731
I,
my depression was a very healthy 

428
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:19,731
reaction to some tough circumstances I 
was going through.

429
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:24,270
I was having a completely healthy self 
protective reaction to what was going on

430
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:29,271
in my life.
And when you say you started putting 

431
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:29,271
positive things in your life,
good solid things in your life,

432
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:30,300
like what kind of things?
A good relationship?

433
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,460
Um,
I started working again.

434
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,850
I started being physically really active
again,

435
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,270
uh,
uh,

436
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,170
I mean I just,
I started boxing actually and,

437
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,200
and uh,
and that was inspiring and stuff and 

438
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,200
that was incredibly frightening to me.
It just,

439
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,100
you know,
that kind of is very,

440
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:51,870
very hard and among other things and uh,
but all that stuff really was really,

441
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:52,650
really good for me.

442
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,240
One of the things that I've been 
dwelling on a lot lately is how 

443
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,420
important struggle is.
And for me personally,

444
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,010
um,
I,

445
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,450
I do a lot of things and I do a lot of 
things that I'm terrible at and uh,

446
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,790
I feel like the more happy I am is when 
I just get slightly better at these 

447
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,500
terrible things.
Like that's when I feel like little bits

448
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:13,430
of progress

449
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,550
that is exactly how we're wired to react
to success.

450
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,510
And if you sort of think about it,
think about us as a species,

451
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:25,360
as an animal.
If you're presented with a challenge and

452
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:28,660
you get a little dose of,
of endorphins and dopamine,

453
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,730
some feel good chemicals when you do a 
task well that will encourage you to 

454
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,890
keep doing that task and keep looking 
for success,

455
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:40,891
small successes in your life,
which is exactly how people adapt and 

456
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:41,320
survive in harsh circumstances.
Um,

457
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,980
the problem with affluent modern society
is it takes away all of the tasks of 

458
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:48,820
survival,
right?

459
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,090
You,
not no one in this room I don't think is

460
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,920
having to figure out every morning how 
to literally physically survive where,

461
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,580
where am I going to get my,
the berries,

462
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:00,280
I'm going to eat today,
we're going to go to kill something that

463
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:00,820
I can eat.

464
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,430
How am I going to avoid the enemy?
Like we're not thinking like that.

465
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,190
And which is enormous blessing,
right?

466
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:11,191
I mean,
it's an enormous luxury to live like 

467
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:11,191
that.
The downside is you don't get this sense

468
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:15,751
of mastery over your circumstances.
You actually don't feel responsible for 

469
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:19,150
your own survival.
You don't feel like you are earning your

470
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,670
own survival in the world.
You feel like it's being handed to you.

471
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:27,090
And I grew up in an affluent suburb and 
I never had a sense as a young man that 

472
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,291
I was contributing in any way to the 
fact that I was physically alive on the 

473
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:31,291
planet.
And well,

474
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:31,540
that's the,
that's,

475
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,080
that's very,
very recent in human history that young,

476
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,960
young men could afford to feel that way.
It's,

477
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,100
um,
again,

478
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:42,610
it's a blessing,
but also a bit of a curse.

479
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,590
It's the most disconnected amongst us 
are always spoiled rich kids that handed

480
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:52,591
everything to them and don't have a,
an understanding at all about the 

481
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:52,591
consequences of their behavior.

482
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:52,591
Yeah.
And,

483
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:53,130
and,
and,

484
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,300
and that kind of life is correlated with
depression.

485
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,070
Yeah.
And,

486
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,580
uh,
I mean,

487
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,870
drug abuse.
Yeah,

488
00:20:58,871 --> 00:20:59,860
all that,
all that stuff.

489
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,290
And the,
the um,

490
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,340
uh,
the suicide rate is rising fastest among

491
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,920
middle aged white men who,
if you listen to some people,

492
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,430
um,
are apparently arguably the demographic 

493
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,210
that they're are most privileged in this
society.

494
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,930
Yes.
Doing the best with this civilization 

495
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,201
that we've constructed during the wars 
biologically in terms of how they 

496
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:25,201
adapted it and psychologically.
Yeah.

497
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,690
Yeah.
The psychologically is a big part of the

498
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:29,440
biology.
Right.

499
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:33,100
And the thing about this quest for 
stuff,

500
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,640
you know,
and one of the things I thought was 

501
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,441
really interesting in the book where you
were outlining the key factors for 

502
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:42,010
happiness and that wealth is not the 
primary one,

503
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:47,011
but being good at something,
being recognized for being good at 

504
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:47,890
something,
being a part of a group,

505
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,990
like all these things were primary.

506
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,170
Yeah.
I mean,

507
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:52,970
if you think about it,
and again,

508
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:54,950
in evolutionary terms,
um,

509
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,340
we are safest when we are needed.
Yeah.

510
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,070
So if you're in a group and the group 
needs you,

511
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,910
your status in the group is secure.
And it had better be because humans do 

512
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,951
not survive alone in the wild.
A alone human in nature is a dead human,

513
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,390
right?
We're primates.

514
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:16,510
We're social primates alone.
Primate in the,

515
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,860
in,
in nature is a dead primate.

516
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,140
And uh,
for most of the species.

517
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,460
And we get our,
we get our safety or protection from the

518
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,260
fact that we worked very,
very well in groups.

519
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:30,290
We don't have long claws.
We don't have a sharp teeth.

520
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,620
We can't run very fast.
We can't climb trees worth a damn.

521
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Were extremely vulnerable.
And we get our safety and our dominance 

522
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,860
in the natural world from our ability to
work in a group.

523
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,080
So if you're necessary to that group,
you're safe.

524
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,680
So people get very depressed when 
circumstances in their life change and 

525
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,461
they're suddenly not needed,
right when people get old and retire 

526
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:52,160
there at very,
very high risk of depression.

527
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:53,990
And sometimes suicide,
uh,

528
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:58,991
when people lose their job and can't 
find a job there at extremely high risk 

529
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:03,461
of depression and suicide.
So when the economy takes a downturn as 

530
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:04,490
it did in 2008,
um,

531
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,060
and the unemployment rate goes up,
the suicide rate immediately goes up.

532
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,090
It tracks the unemployment rate almost.
Exactly.

533
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,480
And one of the points I make in my book 
is that a very small number of mostly 

534
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,191
men collapsed the US economy in 2008 and
most of them living on was working on 

535
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:24,680
Wall Street.
And there was a direct.

536
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,680
I read an article in an academic journal
on Epod,

537
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,370
a epidemics,
um,

538
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,790
that there was a directly attributable 
to the financial collapse.

539
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:43,030
There were five or 6,000
additional suicides in the United 

540
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,370
States,
mostly middle aged white men.

541
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,790
Okay.
And sort of professional prefer 

542
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,520
professional people and um,
of,

543
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,980
of all of all classes.
And um,

544
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,660
and the,
uh,

545
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,500
and I realized that that was almost 
exactly the casualty rate from the two 

546
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,580
wars from Iraq and Afghanistan.
In other words,

547
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,970
something that happened at home 
economically killed just as many 

548
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,380
Americans as both wars did and nobody 
went to prison.

549
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Not One of those guys was prosecuted.
The people responsible for the collapse 

550
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,790
of our economy.
Nothing happened to those guys.

551
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,730
And you could argue they kill just as 
many people as,

552
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,740
you know,
our enemies did overseas.

553
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,180
And there's a real injustice there.

554
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,810
Well,
I think most people aren't even aware of

555
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:33,811
how screw the whole thing was.
And there's a great documentary that I 

556
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:34,150
always recommend to people called an 
inside job.

557
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,680
Yeah.
Fantastic.

558
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:37,660
Yeah.
When that guy's starts questioning those

559
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:42,661
economics professors,
those are the guys who eventually got 

560
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:46,441
jobs in the government and he went from 
there and got jobs at big corporations 

561
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:50,941
and you see them like folding,
folding under the weight of the actual 

562
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:51,690
truth of what they've done.
Yeah.

563
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:52,510
It's

564
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,770
what was disturbing.
I mean,

565
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:54,370
listen,
there were,

566
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:59,371
I mean there were,
there were companies that were getting 

567
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:01,680
bailed out by the taxpayer to the tune 
of billions of dollars,

568
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,490
right?
Bailed out and the head,

569
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,570
the corporate leaders,
they corporate heads of those companies 

570
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,690
who had bankrupted their countries and 
ask the country to bail them out while 

571
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:20,791
they were getting bailed out.
These men were taking year end bonuses 

572
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:20,791
of 10,
20,

573
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,300
$30,000,000.

574
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,750
Yeah.
It was stunning.

575
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:26,810
And then they were trying to put a cap 
on the bonuses,

576
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,080
like instead of removing it,
they were going to put a cap on the 

577
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,080
bonus cap of 20 million.
Right.

578
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,150
It's just,
it's insane.

579
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:32,420
St.
Right.

580
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,520
So you,
you think about that and um,

581
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,210
in,
in,

582
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:40,390
in you makes you feel.
It makes me feel like we don't really 

583
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,781
have a country,
like an entity it group that isn't 

584
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:45,320
willing to defend itself isn't really a 
group.

585
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,180
Right.
We were attacked by,

586
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:52,181
in some ways,
we were attacked by those people 

587
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:52,181
economically,
right?

588
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:55,660
The actions of those people,
the selfserving actions have a very 

589
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,660
small number of people cost this 
country.

590
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:59,180
$14,000,000,000,000,
right?

591
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,940
There were no consequences for those 
people.

592
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:05,600
They're actually rewarded and it makes a
person think like,

593
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,520
wow,
is there,

594
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,870
is there something,
is there something called America like 

595
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,031
the United States like innocent in the 
sense that we'll defend ourselves if 

596
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:16,031
we're attacked.
I mean,

597
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,690
that's one of the definitions of a 
country,

598
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:19,970
of a group and we didn't defend 
ourselves.

599
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:23,540
And so you saw in the recent election,
this sort of,

600
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,460
um,
the confusion in the,

601
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:28,220
in the population about what it means to
be an American.

602
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,610
Like who?
Like what,

603
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:34,611
what do we belong to here?
Like what do we owe our loyalty to an 

604
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:34,900
enormous amount of confusion and,
and,

605
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,090
and,
and in my opinion,

606
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,580
it's,
it's increasing,

607
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:40,010
not decreasing right now in the current 
administration,

608
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:45,011
but it comes from some of those 
questions like we're in two that no 

609
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:45,690
one's paying attention to.
We,

610
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,370
you know,
we lost $14,000,000,000,000

611
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:52,371
and nobody blinked.
Like what is it that we belong to and 

612
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:52,371
what is it?
Yeah,

613
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:57,080
I mean,
we do seem to be in a deep state of 

614
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,391
confusion and I think one of the things 
you're seeing with people even like 

615
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,100
trump supporters,
people,

616
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:04,620
uh,
that are these online fraud people,

617
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,310
you know,
the little frog avatars,

618
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,400
I think one of the things that they like
about it is that becomes,

619
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,290
they become a part of a troublesome,
a little group.

620
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,890
Oh,
totally.

621
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:14,040
Yeah.

622
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,380
They have a sense of purpose.
Yeah,

623
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,590
absolutely.
I mean,

624
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,690
why do you think people join isis?
I mean these European,

625
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,610
you know,
people in Europe joining Isis.

626
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Yeah.
They want a sense of purpose and you 

627
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,861
know,
they've been taken in by the propaganda 

628
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:29,511
and all that.
They don't realize it's a completely 

629
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:29,520
bloodthirsty,
horrible criminal group,

630
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:31,980
but,
but they want a sense of meaning,

631
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,000
a sense of purpose.
There was a,

632
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,280
um,
great band from out here about 15 years 

633
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,280
ago called called Queens of the Stone 
Age.

634
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,070
Sure.
Love those guys.

635
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:39,800
You amazing.
Right?

636
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,230
And one of the lines line in one of 
their songs started to quote rock lyrics

637
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:45,900
to you,
but one of the lines is,

638
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,440
um,
she wanted something to die for it and 

639
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,410
make it beautiful to live.
Something like that.

640
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,410
That's a very profound insight into what
makes people feel like they're leading a

641
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:59,340
worthy life.

642
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Yeah.
Instead of walking through a nerfed 

643
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,240
world.
Yeah.

644
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,240
It's like what we're doing.
Right.

645
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,000
So PROZAC.
So if you walk around and ask people in 

646
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,000
the street,
what would you die for?

647
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,470
Like,
who,

648
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,450
or what idea would you die for?
I mean,

649
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:13,570
people wouldn't,
you know,

650
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,330
they,
they wouldn't have an answer for most of

651
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:16,820
human history,
you know,

652
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,450
the immediate answer would be,
well,

653
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:19,770
I die for my people.
Right?

654
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:20,880
Of course,
like this and this.

655
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,710
Our encampment gets attacked by the 
enemy.

656
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,510
I would die.
I would die defending this place,

657
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,700
you know,
and,

658
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:27,990
and know that no one has that answer,
right?

659
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,670
And,
and,

660
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,250
and which is shows that we live in 
safety and luxury,

661
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:37,251
which is lovely,
but it deprives people of a sense of 

662
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:37,890
purpose and meaning not just safety and 
luxury,

663
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:42,891
but this staggering change and what has 
been a normal way of living for people 

664
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:44,520
for thousands and thousands of years.

665
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,820
When you were writing this book and you 
were thinking about all the ways that 

666
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,890
human beings have altered the 
environment around them,

667
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,490
did you like,
do you were saying that,

668
00:28:56,491 --> 00:28:59,150
and I've read this before,
the genetics essentially we're riding on

669
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,930
the same genetics that were 10,000
years ago from 20,

670
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,240
25 years.
Um,

671
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,440
or are we going to change that?
Like are we going to become more 

672
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,250
compatible with this bizarre and 
artificial world that we've created?

673
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,220
Or are we going to get deeper and deeper
depressed?

674
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,720
Are we going to.
Well,

675
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,930
okay,
so our society or culture is changing 

676
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,480
way faster than genetic change can 
happen.

677
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,890
Right?
So we haven't even adapted genetically 

678
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,840
to the advent of agriculture 10,000
years ago.

679
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,000
That's pretty crazy,
right?

680
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:35,030
So yeah,
and the only way genetic change happens 

681
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,061
in a population is that there is a 
difference in survival between people 

682
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:38,850
with one trait and people with another 
trade.

683
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,850
So,
so if you have a genetic trait and it 

684
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:48,430
leads to you having fewer children,
eventually 10,000

685
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:50,710
years from now,
people with your genetic trait will tend

686
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:52,870
to die out because you're leaving fewer.
You're,

687
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,030
you're passing on less DNA to the next 
round.

688
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Right?
And if you have a trait that allows you 

689
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,671
to raise more children to maturity,
they carry your DNA and then they'll be 

690
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:04,840
more successful.
And that trade tends to spread.

691
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,290
So does human unhappiness.
There's unhappiness lead to lower 

692
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,980
fertility rates,
probably not.

693
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,330
You know what I mean?
Like I mean,

694
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,020
often a depression starts in midlife.
Um,

695
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:21,220
by that time,
most people have a one or two children,

696
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,170
um,
they've passed on their DNA.

697
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:27,700
So I don't,
it only acts through reproductive rights

698
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,900
is something happened to us then there,
there must be some way where human 

699
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,090
beings are going to become going to 
become accustomed to this bizarre way.

700
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,340
We're living stacked on top of each 
other constantly and traffic.

701
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,410
We are accustomed to it.
I mean,

702
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:43,450
humans are very adaptive,
adaptable.

703
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:43,960
I mean,
you know,

704
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:48,961
people,
you can put people in solitary 

705
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:48,961
confinement in jail and they're not 
happy.

706
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:51,580
They're extremely depressed,
but there it will physically survive for

707
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:52,750
decades.
Right?

708
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:53,650
So,
I mean,

709
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,740
evolution doesn't promise happiness.
It doesn't mean that will evolve towards

710
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:01,741
happiness.
It means that we will adapt so that we 

711
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:03,430
can re reproduce our DNA for the next 
generation.

712
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:08,431
That's all evolution means.
I've always just looked at all this 

713
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:11,490
reliance on electronics and our 
fascination with innovation and I've 

714
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,850
wondered if that's where we're headed if
we're,

715
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,880
I mean,
it's almost like it's priming us for 

716
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,900
some sort of a symbiotic relationship 
with machines that were asked.

717
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We become more reliant on technology 
stack more and more people into places 

718
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,570
make it easier and easier to survive.

719
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,820
That's the one constant is that we're 
constantly embedded in technology.

720
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,080
Yes.
I mean,

721
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:36,130
technology is a tool of like the bow and
Arrow was and,

722
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,940
but,
um,

723
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,320
you know,
keep in mind the,

724
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,500
the segment of the world population 
which is deeply intertwined with high 

725
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,530
tech is very,
very small.

726
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,320
Most of humanity lives in a pretty 
simple and very,

727
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:52,321
very poor way.
So if you're talking about the human 

728
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:52,321
race as a whole,
I mean,

729
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:52,510
I'm not talking about southern 
California.

730
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,060
I'm in New York City,
one of the human race as a whole,

731
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,520
you know,
all this technology happened yesterday,

732
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:58,750
right?
I mean it happened 10 years ago,

733
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,160
20 years ago in 20 years is going to be 
so,

734
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:02,050
you know,
whatever.

735
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:03,610
I mean,
who knows what's coming down the pike.

736
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,470
Um,
but that,

737
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,080
that's not even a blanket of an,
of an eye in evolutionary terms.

738
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:09,010
It doesn't even exist.

739
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,470
I mean,
it's,

740
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,430
evolution happens over the course of 10,
20,000

741
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,430
years.
Now when you living this life,

742
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,390
when you are a war journalist and urine,
these insane places,

743
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,770
and then you come back to New York City,
what kind of like a decompression period

744
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,610
do you have to go through?
Well,

745
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,680
you know,
often the,

746
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,020
the developing world that I've worked 
in,

747
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:34,021
I'm no longer covering wars by the way,
but by the developing world is often a 

748
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:35,000
very chaotic urban mix of,
you know,

749
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:40,001
poverty and cars and,
and pollution and buildings that are 

750
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:40,001
you,
whatever.

751
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,330
I mean it,
it is not necessarily not urban.

752
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,110
Um,
uh,

753
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,540
but what I,
what I would say is that there's a,

754
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:51,541
um,
there's something I would describe as a 

755
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:53,980
kind of disappointment to have the,
the,

756
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,750
if you wake up in the morning and your 
survival is a kind of question mark and 

757
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,350
you know,
that you have to act well and,

758
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,050
and,
and,

759
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:06,510
and with,
with sort of clarity and precision and 

760
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,150
quickness in order to survive.

761
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,130
That is intoxicating,
right?

762
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:15,131
The challenge of that is intoxicating 
and you feel like you're sort of in a 

763
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:18,521
way earning your existence and when you 
leave that it's a relief,

764
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:24,460
but it's also a disappointment and 
because you're no longer earning 

765
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,460
anything,
right?

766
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,290
So it's a relief,
but it's also kind of disappointing and 

767
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:29,290
in that disappointment you can get quite
depressed.

768
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,401
So I know that the depression rate,
like when Pete Been Peace Corps 

769
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:36,020
volunteers come back from two years 
service overseas,

770
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,540
they're not in war zones,
but they're in the developing world,

771
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:42,470
are living in small communities.
They're living at a much more difficult,

772
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:45,410
physically difficult existence than 
people in our system.

773
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:48,380
Most people in our society,
when they come back to America,

774
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,210
the land of cars and everything you 
could want in a superstore in a 

775
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,200
supermarket in Nice beds and everything 
that you think people want.

776
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,590
When Peace Corps volunteers come back to
this lovely environment,

777
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,590
around 25 percent of them get profoundly
depressed.

778
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,830
Wow.
So clearly what wakes people feel good 

779
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,730
is challenged,
not ease.

780
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,630
That's the conclusion I draw.
And not just challenged,

781
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:15,920
but challenged in the context of a 
community of people.

782
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,530
Um,
here we have ease in the,

783
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:19,030
in,
in,

784
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,520
in the context of oneself or one's 
individual family,

785
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,050
but not in the context of the community.
And so,

786
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,240
you know,
if you look at catastrophes,

787
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,370
Hurricane Katrina was just in 
Mississippi and I was amazed,

788
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:34,130
not amazed actually in some ways to have
people have many people say,

789
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,930
well,
we really Miss Hurricane Katrina.

790
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,300
We were all so close afterwards,
you know,

791
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:40,940
is this a society with a lot of racial 
division and all kinds of stuff.

792
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,310
None of that mattered after Hurricane 
Katrina.

793
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,410
Everyone cooperated,
everyone helped each other,

794
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:48,350
make people feel great.
That's what human beings want.

795
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,320
So what we've done by making things too 
safe,

796
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:51,890
we've,
we've,

797
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:56,950
we've dropped off the hills and just 
made everything flat and people long for

798
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,060
those hills,
absolutely.

799
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,240
There's a group of friends that I have 
that are bow hunters and one of the 

800
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,471
things that people have gotten really 
addicted to his solo hunting where even 

801
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,270
regular bow hunting is not quite 
difficult enough for these psychos.

802
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,980
So they go deep,
deep,

803
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:17,981
deep,
20 miles plus into the wilderness by 

804
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:20,861
themselves.
And one of the things they say about it 

805
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:23,891
as how profoundly lonely and sad it is.
And even though they know they could 

806
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,320
walk those 20 plus miles back anytime 
they want,

807
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,530
but there's something about being out 
there by themselves that when they do 

808
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,990
return,
they just feel invigorated and alive and

809
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:38,670
energized and they feel like they've 
accomplished something,

810
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,950
especially if they come back with an 
animal.

811
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,270
Yeah.
Well listen to me,

812
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:43,610
that's an ancient narrative,
right?

813
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:48,611
I mean,
the hunter goes out and kills game and 

814
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:48,611
brings it back and feeds his people.
I mean,

815
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:53,001
that's a beautiful story.
And it is kept human beings alive for 

816
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,740
offered on hundreds of thousands of 
years.

817
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,060
You know,
some hunting is well done in groups and 

818
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,060
some hunting is a solo enterprise 
depending on the animal.

819
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,810
And there absolutely is a role for that 
sort of Solo endeavor.

820
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,120
Scouts are often work by themselves 
because I mean,

821
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:11,600
in a native and native context,
um,

822
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,640
like for example,
the American Indians scouts often work 

823
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:16,640
by themselves because they were just 
harder to detect.

824
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,750
And if Tara,
I'm sure a terrifying endeavor,

825
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,210
um,
but you're doing it for your people and 

826
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:24,210
so you,
you come back from that,

827
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,070
um,
that solo experience,

828
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:27,450
which is so frightening.
I mean,

829
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:32,451
we're social species,
so being alone in a and in danger is 

830
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:35,811
terrifying.
You come back from that to your 

831
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:37,821
community.
You've served your community and your 

832
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:37,821
among your people.
Again,

833
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,060
I must be completely intoxicating.
I envy those people.

834
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:39,660
That experience.

835
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,170
Yeah,
just having the experience of being in 

836
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:45,990
danger and then coming back and being at
peace makes you appreciate that piece,

837
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:49,410
but constantly and consistently being at
peace has a numbing effect.

838
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,860
That's right.
It's like constantly and consistently 

839
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:54,860
being well fed.
I mean,

840
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,700
I mean it.
It's not bad to feel hungry once in a 

841
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:57,700
while.
Then you really appreciate food,

842
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,130
safety,
food,

843
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,150
warmth.
I'm being rested or tired.

844
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:04,630
I mean w w,
w,

845
00:37:04,631 --> 00:37:08,610
w were adapted to to get through 
situations where we don't have enough of

846
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:10,860
what we want,
what we need and if we,

847
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,900
if we're not deprived of those things,
we stop appreciating them and those 

848
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,240
things are what make up life so we're 
actually losing.

849
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,600
We're losing our appreciation,
our enjoyment of the things that make 

850
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,480
life what it is.
And it was a real irony there.

851
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,010
There is a real irony there.

852
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,380
Did you feel compelled at all to come up
with a solution,

853
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,560
I mean in deeply describing and just 
going over the various aspects of these 

854
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:40,030
problems that we're facing as a culture,
as a society?

855
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,810
Did you,
did you have some sort of a lead?

856
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:44,890
I didn't.
I mean,

857
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:46,390
listen,
if I thought,

858
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,150
if there was a solution that I was 
capable of thinking of,

859
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:54,151
I would have put it in the book.
Either I'm not smart enough or there's 

860
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:55,090
no solution.
I don't know what it is.

861
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Yeah.
I think there's some things we can do 

862
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:00,780
around the edges that will help.
Um,

863
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,500
but we're talking about a systemic 
problem in society that has,

864
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,960
that has that got it's start 10,000
years ago and really got it started.

865
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,970
The industrial revolution and really got
really got going into the technological 

866
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,120
revolution.
You're knocking,

867
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,170
I mean,
we're not going to ban the car,

868
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,200
right?
The Amish in Pennsylvania don't use 

869
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,200
cars.
They have a very low rate of suicide and

870
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,340
depression because they spend most of 
their lives within their community,

871
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:29,430
right?
That buffers that are from suicide and 

872
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,430
depression,
we're not going to abandon the car,

873
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,430
right?

874
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,770
We're not going to burn down the 
suburbs,

875
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:32,050
living lean tos.
We'd probably be happier if we did,

876
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,640
but we're not going to do it.
So.

877
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:38,641
But what can we do?
The biggest that we have is the nation 

878
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:41,671
is the country.
And I think one thing that would help 

879
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:43,981
enormously is to treat our nation as if 
we all belong to it and as if we all 

880
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:46,660
respected it and that it was meaningful 
to all of us.

881
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,720
And which means among other things,
it means insisting that politicians who 

882
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,320
denigrate,
um,

883
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,930
who denigrate other other politicians 
who denigrate segments of the 

884
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,851
population,
who rank American citizens in terms of 

885
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:04,450
value,
in terms of being quote,

886
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:05,830
American,
whatever that means.

887
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:11,350
Politicians who do that are undermining 
our sense of national community.

888
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,720
And I think that has a trickle down 
effect,

889
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:15,670
which is extremely demoralizing and 
makes,

890
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,650
gives you the equivalent of feeling 
like,

891
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:21,460
wow,
if you're feeling like you're a child in

892
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,530
a family that might,
with the parents might get divorced.

893
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,500
I remember during the campaign between 
Donald and Hilary,

894
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,150
I sort of felt like,
wow,

895
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:31,030
or mom and dad split up like this 
happening in this country.

896
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:32,680
You know what I mean?
Like,

897
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:33,640
okay,
you can argue,

898
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:38,641
but you guys are really talking as if 
the country's not going to stay 

899
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:38,641
together.
Yeah,

900
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:42,910
that's terrifying.
I think it's extremely demoralizing and 

901
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:42,910
unsettling for people.
Well,

902
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,450
it's also extremely irresponsible,
like the type of person that should be a

903
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:51,451
leader.
It's not the type of person that puts 

904
00:39:51,451 --> 00:39:53,881
that idea out there to the point where 
it gets into the zeitgeists and people 

905
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:53,881
say,
well,

906
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:54,640
hey wait,
maybe we really are in trouble.

907
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,260
Well exactly.
I mean I think,

908
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,730
I think it it fearmongering it is.
And,

909
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,990
and you know,
these are ancient human behaviors and if

910
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:05,710
you tell your people that there's a 
threat,

911
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,750
your people will rally behind you.

912
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,220
I mean,
it's an,

913
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,230
it's an adaptive behavior,
right?

914
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,300
The problem is,
as a politician,

915
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:18,301
if you tell your people that the enemy 
is actually the other political party,

916
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,820
you are effectively splitting the 
country and so you can act tribally all 

917
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:23,820
you want.
I mean,

918
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,680
tribal tribalism has a very negative 
connotation as well.

919
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,860
You can act in that tribal way all you 
want,

920
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,110
as long as you define your tribe as the 
country,

921
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,090
the entire country.
Right?

922
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,750
And if you start slicing off group parts
of the country,

923
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:40,510
demographic groups in the country,
political groups in the country,

924
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:43,420
so you know,
you're actually not really American,

925
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,100
like you really shouldn't be part of 
this.

926
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,590
When you start doing that,
you destroy the country.

927
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,050
You're way more of a threat to our 
democracy than,

928
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,150
than Isis and al Qaeda is.
I mean,

929
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:53,680
we,
we're such a powerful country.

930
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,410
We're the only force that can destroy 
us.

931
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,160
No one else can touch us.
They can hurt us.

932
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:00,930
So they can't really destroy us.
We can destroy us and we can,

933
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,940
we can,
we will destroy ourselves through 

934
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,681
rhetoric.
Who was one of the things that was most 

935
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:08,260
disturbing about the debates when Donald
Trump said that if Hillary Clinton won,

936
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,840
he wouldn't necessarily accept the 
decision.

937
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,160
Yeah,
absolutely.

938
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:17,161
I mean,
he was being a co that was completely 

939
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:17,920
antithetical to the,
uh,

940
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,580
to democracy and to the,
um,

941
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,440
to the concept of a country,
to the concept of a democratic country.

942
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,120
I absolutely,
because he's a part of it.

943
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,210
So if she becomes the president,
she's his president and we're all 

944
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,421
supposed to look at the president as 
this is the one person that we've 

945
00:41:33,421 --> 00:41:34,100
elected as leader and what he's 
essentially saying it's either

946
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,820
me or nothing.

947
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,730
That's right.
And what,

948
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,050
and what I really am.
I'm a democrat.

949
00:41:38,051 --> 00:41:39,530
I didn't vote for Donald Trump.
Um,

950
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,260
but I really didn't like it when some of
my fellow Democrats after he was elected

951
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:45,580
and he was elected,
right?

952
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:46,720
I mean,
one way or another.

953
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,740
Uh,
I mean,

954
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:50,110
if you can investigate Russia if you 
want or whatever,

955
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:52,060
but,
but the fact is that he,

956
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,360
he got the most electoral votes and he's
our president and I really disliked it 

957
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,460
when my,
some of my fellow Democrats said,

958
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,490
he's not my president.
He is actually.

959
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,550
And if you don't like that,
work harder next time and get someone 

960
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:05,680
else elected.
But he gives you a president.

961
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:10,681
And,
and it was equally disgusting when the 

962
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:14,071
shoe was on the other foot with Barack 
Obama and some conservatives started 

963
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,520
saying that Barack Obama wasn't really 
American,

964
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,520
or he wasn't really their president or 
that he was an enemy of the state,

965
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,550
that he was a secret Muslim spy.
He wanted to destroy Manchurian 

966
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:26,550
candidate.
Yeah,

967
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:26,550
exactly.
I mean,

968
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,080
it's totally irresponsible and,
and it's antithetic.

969
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:31,570
It's the opposite of patriotism and it's
revolting.

970
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,300
Do you think in that case it may be.
It's good that we have a guy like Donald

971
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,300
Trump and the president because he is 
kind of like almost like a human 

972
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,300
hurricane.
He's something to rally against.

973
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,621
He's a,
a problem that's occurred where there's 

974
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:46,820
the eroding confidence in the president 
now.

975
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,930
I mean,
it's palpable.

976
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,150
People know he lies.
He lies all the time.

977
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,420
I mean,
he just accused James Comey today of 

978
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,660
lying under oath when he talked about 
their conversations.

979
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,620
You know,
I think Donald Trump is a very damaged 

980
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,771
and unhealthy person.
I think he causes a lot of pain to 

981
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:06,771
people around him.
And I,

982
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:10,791
I'm,
I'm guessing that he's in an enormous 

983
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:10,791
amount of,
of psychic pain himself,

984
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:16,050
sense for all the hate tweets and all 
the things we constantly going after 

985
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:16,480
Rosie O'donnell and why?

986
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,580
I mean,
what I've learned in my life is that if 

987
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:21,580
someone's acting badly,
they're in pain.

988
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:21,580
Yeah.
I mean,

989
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,470
it's a really simple rule,
right?

990
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,200
They're either scared or they're in 
pain.

991
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:29,201
I think he's both.
And on some level I feel kind of a kind 

992
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:30,320
of compassion for him.
But what I,

993
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,890
what I mean he's,
he,

994
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,910
he's,
he already is and will be a completely 

995
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,760
failed president,
but he may actually help this country in

996
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:39,030
his failure.
Um,

997
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,650
the gop I think has abandoned all of its
core values and core moral principles 

998
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:51,170
and decided that seems to have decided 
that anything that will help the party 

999
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,920
is more important than things that will 
help the country.

1000
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,580
And that is a very,
very undemocratic way to think.

1001
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,290
Um,
I think if,

1002
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,950
if Hillary Clinton had been elected and 
these things were coming out,

1003
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,980
the same kind of things about Russia,
et Cetera,

1004
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,000
are coming out,
the gop would be crossing her,

1005
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,020
prosecuting her up to her eyeballs,
right?

1006
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,200
So they have a complete double standard.
And what I'm hoping is that the trump 

1007
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,521
administration is such a failure that it
gets the gop to reevaluate its policy of

1008
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:25,130
partisan politics as a way to wind 
power.

1009
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,450
And I hope it makes the entire country 
realize that the only way to really wind

1010
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:33,900
power is through bipartisan politics.
And you can argue all you want,

1011
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:38,901
but you have to.
You have to put the welfare of the 

1012
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,061
country first.
I read an amazing book called our 

1013
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:41,061
political selves.
I think it was called,

1014
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,430
um,
that about half of our political opinion

1015
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:48,840
is jen is genetically determined.
So genetically determined.

1016
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:49,500
Yeah.
So,

1017
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:50,400
and it,
which makes sense.

1018
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:55,401
So liberalism and conservatism,
basically liberalism is concerned with 

1019
00:44:55,401 --> 00:45:00,111
fairness within the group and equality 
within the group and an acceptance of 

1020
00:45:00,111 --> 00:45:01,320
outsiders as possible for possible 
inclusion in the group.

1021
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:06,530
Conservatism is focused on hierarchy and
sort of law and order and a suspicion of

1022
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:10,500
outsiders and they're very,
very powerful evolutionary,

1023
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,850
adaptive evolutionary reasons for both 
of those worldviews.

1024
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,150
And they've done studies with identical 
twins that were adopted at birth and 

1025
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:25,581
compared them to fraternal twins and 
there's a far higher concordance of a 

1026
00:45:25,581 --> 00:45:29,781
political opinion in identical twins 
that were adopted at birth and put in 

1027
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:32,430
different kinds of families than with 
fraternal twins.

1028
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,840
So that means that our political,
apparently it's around 50 percent of our

1029
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:39,090
political beliefs,
are genetically determined,

1030
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,090
which means that those beliefs had 
adaptive value in,

1031
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:43,530
uh,
in our evolutionary past,

1032
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,470
which means that the argument,
I'm right,

1033
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:48,210
you're completely wrong and you 
shouldn't exist,

1034
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:53,211
is a false argument,
is that the country actually needs both 

1035
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:54,090
parties very,
very badly.

1036
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:58,740
And that a healthy society has 
conservatism and liberalism in a kind of

1037
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:01,350
dynamic tension where yes,
they might fight,

1038
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:06,351
they might argue,
but they are there roughly proportional 

1039
00:46:06,351 --> 00:46:07,500
in the population and equal weight is 
given to those two.

1040
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:08,280
Competing values

1041
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,000
wasn't taken into consideration that 
when these people are adopted,

1042
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,550
that growing up,
adopted without your biological parents,

1043
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:18,551
puts you in a certain mindset 
automatically and that maybe it wasn't 

1044
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:20,740
necessarily a genetic thing,
but it was a circumstantial or nurture.

1045
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:25,870
Well,
they compared identical twins who are 

1046
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:25,870
genetically identical,
of course,

1047
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,040
that were adopted to fraternal twins who
were adopted.

1048
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:30,230
You understand?
Yes,

1049
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,780
and fraternal twins are not genetically 
identical,

1050
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,980
but they still come from the same body 
they used to come to.

1051
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,590
Their DNA is different individuals.
Right.

1052
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:44,030
So both sets of twins were adopted,
so they all went through that.

1053
00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:45,620
Whatever that is,
that,

1054
00:46:45,621 --> 00:46:47,600
that process,
the effects of that,

1055
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:50,930
whatever they are.
One our one shared DNA,

1056
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,220
exact duplicates of their DNA.
The other set of twins don't.

1057
00:46:55,221 --> 00:46:56,870
They're fraternal.
So the,

1058
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,840
the,
the twins that shared identical DNA,

1059
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:04,870
we're far more likely to have the same 
political beliefs than the fraternal 

1060
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:08,090
twins.
In other words,

1061
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:13,091
the genetic component was influencing 
their beliefs and the environmental 

1062
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:17,771
component was not as much compared to 
the fraternal twins is an amazing book 

1063
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:18,590
and it really,
to me,

1064
00:47:18,591 --> 00:47:22,010
it makes sense,
like both worldviews clearly were needed

1065
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:24,260
to keep our society healthy and strong 
and safe.

1066
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:24,890
I mean,
God,

1067
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,920
I mean,
a country that was run completely by 

1068
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:29,920
liberals would get overrun by,
you know,

1069
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,720
the enemy state next door immediately,
right?

1070
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:35,350
A country that was completely run by 
conservatives would never get overrun by

1071
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:40,351
the enemy,
but it will be a heartless and brutal 

1072
00:47:40,351 --> 00:47:41,890
society where the poor weren't taken 
care of and etc.

1073
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,830
Etc.
So you can't havE one or the other.

1074
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:46,930
You need both.
The kind of dynamic tension.

1075
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,850
So it makes genetic sense that it works 
that way.

1076
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:54,090
JuSt like there would be genetic 
variations and all sorts of different 

1077
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,481
aspects of people,
height and personality and all those 

1078
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:57,481
different things.
Yeah,

1079
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:58,210
I mean,
it's sore character traits,

1080
00:47:58,211 --> 00:47:58,780
right?
I mean,

1081
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:01,810
they're partly genetic and they're 
partly determined by experience.

1082
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,430
So,
um,

1083
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,600
you know,
courage or whatever,

1084
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:06,640
generosity,
a sensation seeking,

1085
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:08,920
right?
A is a genetic trait.

1086
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,200
Um,
but you can,

1087
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,800
you can your,
since your impulse towards sensation 

1088
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,550
seeking is also determined by your 
experiences in life.

1089
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,440
Right?
I don't know what the proportions are,

1090
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:23,200
but in terms of political belief,
it's roughly 50 slash 50.

1091
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Your experience in life is about 50 
percent responsible for your political 

1092
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:31,240
beliefs and the,
and the other 50 percent is genetics.

1093
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,640
We're always looking for one reason,
right?

1094
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,320
We're always looking for nature or 
nurture.

1095
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:40,321
We'll looking for one of.
We're not looking at this just whole 

1096
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:42,781
soup of different entangled influences 
that create a person.

1097
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,880
Yeah.
And it's really interesting when I tell 

1098
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:47,880
people that their genetics determine 
half of their political view,

1099
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,750
they get really upset,
right?

1100
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,530
They want to be completely 
self-determining,

1101
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,890
right?
I mean that people want to think that 

1102
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,751
they are completely w whatever they are,
they've created themselves and certainly

1103
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,740
something as emotional as political 
belief.

1104
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:01,990
They don't want to think that is wired 
into their dna at all.

1105
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:03,300
But You know,
that's,

1106
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:04,990
that's the truth of it.

1107
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,850
Well,
just determinism in general.

1108
00:49:06,851 --> 00:49:11,851
I mean,
I remember the first time it was ever 

1109
00:49:11,851 --> 00:49:11,851
really deeply explained to me by sam 
harris.

1110
00:49:11,851 --> 00:49:15,340
I was rejecting it like almost instant 
of realizing I was like,

1111
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:17,200
I didn't want to just be open minded 
about it.

1112
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,600
I wanted to go to aa,
na.

1113
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:22,170
You could pull yourself up.
You could figure it out.

1114
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,880
Yeah.
You do whaT your,

1115
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,210
your willpower.
You decide what you want to do with your

1116
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,400
life,
but not really necessarily.

1117
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:27,910
I mean,
listen,

1118
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:29,650
when I was young I was a really good 
distance runner.

1119
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,680
Right?
And I ran the half mile mile at up to 

1120
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:34,680
10,000
meters marathon,

1121
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,500
whatever,
ran 4:12

1122
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:40,501
for the mile,
which is a pretty decent time and it's 

1123
00:49:40,501 --> 00:49:41,981
very fast.
I really wanted it to be like the 

1124
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:41,981
fastest miler in the world.
Right.

1125
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:44,250
And I trained as fast as anyone who's 
ever trained as,

1126
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:46,630
as hard as anyone's ever trained and I 
might.

1127
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,480
My ceiling was poor 12.
I mean that was genetically determined.

1128
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:50,490
No,
sorry.

1129
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:55,491
Like you can run 130 miles a week like I
did for months on end and still not go 

1130
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:56,920
to the olympics.
Yeah,

1131
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,850
there's no doubt about it may not as a 
mixed martial arts commentator,

1132
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:04,150
the the big factor that you can't do 
anything about his power.

1133
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,320
Some people are born with striking power
and it doesn't make any sense.

1134
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,720
They have,
they look exactly the Same.

1135
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:13,330
They look just like a person who can't 
hit nearly as hard as them.

1136
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,470
Right,
right.

1137
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Yeah.
I mean my understanding is the sort of 

1138
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:19,500
sequencing of muscle groups in 
coordination that result in that kind of

1139
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,520
power is amazing.
It's bone structure as well.

1140
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,290
There's a level of variables is actually
the,

1141
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:23,800
the,
the,

1142
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:28,890
the geometry of the shoulder,
like how wide your shoulders are in 

1143
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:28,890
terms of the

1144
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,740
hip to waist ratio.
There's a lot of different factors.

1145
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,590
Kidding.
Yeah.

1146
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:36,910
That's one of the reasons why men can 
hit so much harder than women is 

1147
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:37,400
literally the shape of the hips.
women's hips are wider,

1148
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:42,401
the the legs go inward more.
It's a different sort of mechanical 

1149
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:43,820
advantage which is probably connected to
the speed.

1150
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:47,630
You can throw a baseball at the same 
skeletal.

1151
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Yeah.
Apparently boys and girls can throw 

1152
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,040
pretty much the same until puberty and 
then it really splits,

1153
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,560
um,
and uh,

1154
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:56,220
and so it's probably for that reason I 
will.

1155
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:01,390
That'd be interesting.
Like to see what they do with 

1156
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,290
transgender women to men who start 
taking testosterone.

1157
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,240
I don't think it changes the shape of 
your pelvis.

1158
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,950
No,
I mean the testosterone doesn't,

1159
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,530
you know,
isn't going to change your.

1160
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,010
It does,
it does.

1161
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:15,210
It does have some effects on bone 
density and I think the width of the 

1162
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,380
shoulders changes and certain 
characters,

1163
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,980
the face obviously changes.

1164
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,540
Yeah,
right.

1165
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,140
Yeah,
yeah.

1166
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,270
And Just the sort of muscle explosive 
power of the muscles.

1167
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,570
Then as you get old you lose explosive 
power as a man.

1168
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,290
Right.
So,

1169
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,210
I mean testosterone,
historic key.

1170
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:29,630
You're,
I mean,

1171
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:34,631
you're,
you're at your peak in your early 

1172
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:34,631
twenties,
I guess.

1173
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:34,631
Yeah.
But anyway,

1174
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:36,590
what we're saying is that there really 
are genetic limitations.

1175
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:40,970
There's no doubt about it.
And this idea of like a fair fight.

1176
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:46,010
There's sometimes it's not fair.
It's just not going to be.

1177
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,890
And a with you as the mile with some 
people.

1178
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:50,660
It's the,
the ability to hit hard.

1179
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,790
It's some people,
it's just speed,

1180
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:58,020
you know,
I mean if you've ever seen like a floyd 

1181
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,651
mayweather fight is incredibly clear 
that not only is he ridiculously 

1182
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:03,581
skillful,
but he's got some stupendous speed 

1183
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:03,880
advantage over most human beings.
Yeah,

1184
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:04,760
yeah,
absolutely.

1185
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,500
I also,
I was watching his fight of his,

1186
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:07,790
it was sort of slow mo.

1187
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,820
I mean I sort of slowed it down so I 
could really watch and he got hit full 

1188
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,290
in the face by somebody I mean,
right in the face and his,

1189
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,190
his eyes never blink.
Yeah.

1190
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,050
Yeah.
Like he,

1191
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:21,530
I mean he couldn't get out of the way 
and he watched that thing come in and 

1192
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:21,530
hit him square in the face and his eyes 
never closed.

1193
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,270
It's incredible.
Yeah.

1194
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,040
Really good.
Boxers can do that.

1195
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,240
As they're getting punched in their 
face,

1196
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:28,700
their eyes are wide open and they're 
looking for the counter.

1197
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,530
It's really incredible.
It's amazing.

1198
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,790
No flinch at all.
I mean,

1199
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:36,791
nothing.
Absolutely nothing amount of training 

1200
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:36,791
you would have to do to overcome the 
end.

1201
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:36,970
It's one of the most,
one of them.

1202
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,210
More important reasons why it's so 
critical to learn striking in particular

1203
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:44,570
at a very young age,
the body develops,

1204
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,780
some people can pick it up later in life
and still be really successful at it,

1205
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:52,781
but I don't think you ever really get 
like a real elite boxer that doesn't 

1206
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:55,840
start training before puberty or around 
puberty.

1207
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,560
You're probably right now,
there's just something about the 

1208
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,990
development of the body,
like your body growing and maturing with

1209
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:07,991
this task,
learning how to strike and move and 

1210
00:53:07,991 --> 00:53:09,890
explode with combinations.
Likewise for music and languages,

1211
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,780
and if you're not learning that before 
puberty,

1212
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:14,450
you will never be like at a top,
top,

1213
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:15,990
top world class level.
Ah,

1214
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,200
that makes sense.
in terms of languages,

1215
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:20,480
you will not be able to speak with a 
perfect exit.

1216
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,530
Really?
Yup.

1217
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,670
After puberty,
the,

1218
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,070
the brain is finished wiring itself and 
it cannot.

1219
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:31,190
It cannot exactly mimic a foreign accent
and if you learn french or whatever at 

1220
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,730
any language that you know,
eight,

1221
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:33,360
nine,
10,

1222
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,050
you can sound exactly like a native and 
after puberty you can.

1223
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,060
Wow.
Do you have kids?

1224
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,420
Yes.
I have a three and a half month old 

1225
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:44,420
daughter.

1226
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:44,420
Well,
when they start talking to you,

1227
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:44,880
man,
that's when it gets weird.

1228
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,010
Um,
I have,

1229
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:47,550
uh,
three,

1230
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:49,410
uh,
29 and a seven.

1231
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,780
And uh,
what's,

1232
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,150
what's really fascinating is watching 
the,

1233
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:55,150
um,
the,

1234
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,830
the traits that you know,
have come directly from dna,

1235
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:04,100
like parts of you emerge out of the kid 
and maybe one kid and then the other 

1236
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:06,990
kid,
none of it,

1237
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:12,380
you know,
and some of it will be your wife and 

1238
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:12,630
it's just,
it's so strange to.

1239
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,200
You try to piece it together.
Like what,

1240
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,520
what our instincts,
right.

1241
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:19,260
Why are,
why are dogs barking at snakes?

1242
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:20,850
They don't know what the fuck a snake 
is,

1243
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:25,851
but they know something's wrong.
There's something deep in their memorY 

1244
00:54:25,851 --> 00:54:28,911
banks and say this is an issue.
Whereas a stuffed animal on the ground 

1245
00:54:28,911 --> 00:54:28,911
is not an issue.
Right?

1246
00:54:28,911 --> 00:54:29,300
Yeah,
that's rIght.

1247
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,180
That's right.
We don't know what that is entirely.

1248
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:33,680
Well,
I tell you what it is,

1249
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:38,681
is that the dogs that weren't 
reflexively fearful of something that 

1250
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:41,600
looked like a snake died more often 
produce offspring,

1251
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,900
and so they'll bark at a crooked stick 
to just to be on the safe side.

1252
00:54:44,901 --> 00:54:46,100
And you know,
likewise,

1253
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:48,380
humans are scared of heights.
Um,

1254
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,370
yeah,
there's a,

1255
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,250
if you're not scared of heights,
you're more likely to fall and you won't

1256
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:54,500
pass on your genes.
I'm lucy,

1257
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:57,570
the famous early,
early human skeleton in,

1258
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,550
in east africa.
I don't know.

1259
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:05,551
I mean,
you do know lucy from your science 

1260
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:05,551
classes.
Yeah.

1261
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:06,320
Um,
she died by falling out of a tree.

1262
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:07,730
Wow.
Yeah.

1263
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,880
They just figured that out from the 
fractures and stuff and her bone 

1264
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:12,880
structure.
Wow.

1265
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,690
Yeah.
That must have been incredibly common.

1266
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,400
It's just all the different things that 
people are afraid of.

1267
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:21,850
Arachnophobia video phobia,
fear of spiders and snakes.

1268
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,860
I mean those are directly related to 
poison.

1269
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,620
I'm terrified of spiders.
So you feel as genetic,

1270
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:27,910
like maybe someone in

1271
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,670
past or somewhat.
Well,

1272
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:31,100
I tell you,
I mean the,

1273
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:35,490
the range of things that,
the common phobias that people have,

1274
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,780
those,
those things have a,

1275
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,280
have a sort of survival significance,
right?

1276
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,730
So people usually aren't phobIc of 
chairs because chairs,

1277
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:48,180
we're not a survival threat in our 
evolutionary past,

1278
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,030
but heights,
spiders,

1279
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,910
snakes,
uh,

1280
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,750
those kinds of things.
We're a,

1281
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,650
we're a threat.
And so when children get phobias,

1282
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,930
they're choosing something that makes 
genetic sense.

1283
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,300
Yes.
Why I chose spiders,

1284
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:05,250
I don't know,
I was just exposed to it.

1285
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:07,950
Frightening spider at the wrong moment 
in my insecure little life.

1286
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:08,490
Do you think you were

1287
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:13,630
opposed to it or you think maybe is it 
possible that someone in your past to 

1288
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,500
some ancestor so far passed that through
the dna?

1289
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:15,920
Well,
I mean,

1290
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:20,921
we're all predisposed towards being.
I'm a reasonably fearful of those 

1291
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,010
things,
right?

1292
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:27,460
A phobia is a panic disorder,
so we're all nervous around.

1293
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,760
I'm barking dogs,
snakes,

1294
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,380
spiders,
heights,

1295
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,580
those kinds of things,
right?

1296
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,130
Um,
be claustrophobia and being trapped in a

1297
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:41,131
small space,
that's all normal things to be worried 

1298
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,321
about,
but when it crosses the threshold to a 

1299
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:43,321
phobia,
that's a panic disorder.

1300
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:47,850
And that is a function of something 
going on in your childhood where,

1301
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,830
but is it absolutely in your childhood?
I mean,

1302
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:55,860
phobia start in childhood yet,
but I mean is it possible that someone 

1303
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,131
could have a video phobia arachnophobia 
and not have experienced spiders or 

1304
00:56:59,131 --> 00:57:03,751
snakes?
It's one of the things that happened to 

1305
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:05,401
me when I was hosting fear factor as I 
would see people that were pretty risk 

1306
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:06,700
taking.
They were and they would,

1307
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,170
they would be willing to do the heights.

1308
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,200
They would be willing to jump a car off 
the top of a building.

1309
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,390
They would take chances.
They were risk takers,

1310
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,740
but you'd put them in front of a snake 
and they would freak the fuck out.

1311
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:20,800
And it was,
it was a deep cellular thing,

1312
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,680
like you could see with some people 
that,

1313
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,730
that they weren't cowards,
they weren't timid folks.

1314
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,160
Right.
But they would see that one thing,

1315
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:31,930
whatever that thing is.
Right.

1316
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:32,770
Well,
I,

1317
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:33,490
you know,
I don't know,

1318
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,030
I,
I,

1319
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,400
I will tell you though that once I don't
have a television,

1320
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:41,401
but I was in a hotel like I watch tv 
when I'm traveling because I'm in a 

1321
00:57:41,401 --> 00:57:45,550
hotel and I saw fear factor and they're.
And so keep in mind,

1322
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:50,250
I've been terrified of spiders my entire
life and there was one.

1323
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,380
I mean this was actually quite 
traumatizing to me.

1324
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:54,700
I mean seriously,
like traumatizing,

1325
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,770
like it affected me for days.

1326
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,730
There was like a very hot young woman in
a bikini and you put her in a glass,

1327
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:06,130
like a glass box and you dumped a 55 
gallon drum of tranches onto her.

1328
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,410
Yeah.
I remember that her boyfriend threw up,

1329
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:11,880
it was so and she finally stood up with 
tarantulas,

1330
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:16,890
fallen off her.
I mean she couldn't take it and I was 

1331
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:17,890
like in the fetal position in the corner
of my hotel room.

1332
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:18,810
Wow.
Yeah.

1333
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,560
It waS totally horrifying to me.
I mean,

1334
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:25,561
it really messed me up for a few days.
It's just so strange that there's 

1335
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:25,810
particular things that resonate like 
that,

1336
00:58:25,811 --> 00:58:28,570
like particular things,
whether it's a snake or a spider,

1337
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,800
just a.
I mean,

1338
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:36,930
I really wonder if like the things that 
human beings have and that also animals 

1339
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:40,390
have these instincts.
If we just don't totally understand what

1340
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:45,391
memory is,
we don't totally understand genetic 

1341
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:45,391
memories,
right?

1342
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:45,391
Yeah.
Well,

1343
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:46,270
it's all stuff that,
that helped us survive.

1344
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,720
Those are all threats in our,
in our primordial passed.

1345
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,380
Now you've got a,
a documentary out that you're working on

1346
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:54,350
as well.
Uh,

1347
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,150
well it's out.
No,

1348
00:58:55,151 --> 00:58:56,380
it's airing on sunday.
It's,

1349
00:58:56,381 --> 00:58:58,810
um,
it's called hell on earth.

1350
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:03,990
It's about the syrian civil war and the 
rise of isis and it's out on national 

1351
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:06,610
geographic channel nine eastern and 
central,

1352
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:07,510
uh,
this sunday,

1353
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,660
this sunday.
Um,

1354
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,210
is it going to be available?
I mean,

1355
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:15,211
you can obviously watch it at the time,
but it's going to be available on 

1356
00:59:15,211 --> 00:59:16,670
netflix or apple tv or something like 
that where I don't know that.

1357
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

1358
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,370
It's,
um,

1359
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,770
I haven't even thought that far ahead.
I mean it's owned by national,

1360
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:26,260
so I don't know quite know how they're.
I'm sure you'll be able to get it on 

1361
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:26,570
their website at some point,
but it's airing on sunday.

1362
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,060
And what was your experience doing that?
Well,

1363
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,830
you know,
I was home writing tribe actually.

1364
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:34,030
And so I wasn't overseas and you 
couldn't really get into Syria anyway.

1365
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,680
I mean it was a suicidal thing to do.
Um,

1366
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,600
and uh,
so what we did,

1367
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,880
my colleague nick,
the guy who was here earlier,

1368
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:46,240
um,
we basically sort of work the border 

1369
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,060
border areas around Syria.
I'm looking for people who were living 

1370
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:54,071
in Syria who knew people in Syria who 
could shoot for us and we found some 

1371
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:57,611
very,
very brave people who documented their 

1372
00:59:57,611 --> 00:59:58,340
lives under isis,
their lives with the free syrian army.

1373
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:00,200
There was a lot of combat.
Um,

1374
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,860
and we accumulated about an hour,
a thousand hours of footage and 

1375
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,011
interviews we did with experts and we 
put together a hell on earth trying to 

1376
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:13,340
explain how really quite peaceful 
democratic protests,

1377
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,840
um,
turn into violent demonstrations and 

1378
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,300
finally into a civil war.
And of course it's the,

1379
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:20,950
it was the repressive government.
I mean,

1380
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:24,290
people protest in the street and they're
met with machine gun fire and eventually

1381
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:29,380
civilians are going to get some machine 
guns themselves and fight back and 

1382
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,380
that's how you get a civil war.

1383
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,960
How do you take thousands of hours like 
that and boil it down to a one show?

1384
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:34,950
YeAh.
Well that's,

1385
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,190
it's very,
very hard.

1386
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:36,850
Um,
uh,

1387
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,880
I mean,
that's what filmmaking is and it's 

1388
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,921
figuring out what's the one percent that
goes into the film and how do I 

1389
01:00:43,921 --> 01:00:43,921
structure it?
Um,

1390
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,660
how much time does it take to do 
something?

1391
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:46,420
We had a really good.
I mean,

1392
01:00:46,421 --> 01:00:48,520
this is the first I've made.
This is my fifth film.

1393
01:00:48,521 --> 01:00:53,521
Most of the films I've made,
it was me and an editor and so another 

1394
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:53,650
person in the room or whatever,
this.

1395
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,810
We had a big team.
And so we had some very,

1396
01:00:55,811 --> 01:01:00,811
very smart yoUng people who are going 
through all this footage and 

1397
01:01:00,811 --> 01:01:00,811
categorizing it.
Like,

1398
01:01:00,811 --> 01:01:01,540
here,
this is a section about,

1399
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,410
you know,
this material is about whatever,

1400
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,420
escaping isis and this is about trying 
to find whatever they would.

1401
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:12,690
They would sort of put it into 
categories and then I would start to 

1402
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:13,330
look through some of that material and 
congratulate,

1403
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,040
sort of build a,
build a structure,

1404
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,490
the,
um,

1405
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:22,530
the situation in Syria seems to be a,
for someone who just hasn't studied it 

1406
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,100
that much,
but just looks at it from the outside.

1407
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:28,720
One of the bleaker darker situations 
that we have here in the world.

1408
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:33,940
I mean,
it's the tragic tragedy of this 

1409
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:33,940
generation.
I think,

1410
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,160
uh,
over 400,000

1411
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:36,440
syrians,
mostly civilians have died.

1412
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,650
The equivalent equivalent death toll in 
this country would be,

1413
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:43,280
I think seven or $8 million americans.
These are equivalent amount of people.

1414
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,250
Um,
and,

1415
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:49,370
and half the country,
half the syrian population has been 

1416
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:50,240
displaced from their homes and millions,
millions or,

1417
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:50,840
uh,
you know,

1418
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:52,740
outside the country's borders in europe 
and,

1419
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,560
and,
and even in this country.

1420
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,530
What did you take out of the 
documentary?

1421
01:01:57,531 --> 01:02:02,531
I mean,
it seems like no one has a solution for 

1422
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:02,531
Syria.

1423
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:02,531
No,
I mean,

1424
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:04,320
civil wards are tough that way.
Um,

1425
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,940
I think isis,
isis eventually is going to be defeated 

1426
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:10,320
on the battlefield.
Um,

1427
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:15,450
they're going to be eradicated.
And I hope they are because they're a 

1428
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:18,400
ghastly,
brutal group m and a side who is,

1429
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,440
who's killed way more people than isis.
He just didn't do it publicly like they 

1430
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:24,440
did.
Um,

1431
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,510
he's the leader of Syria,
the president of Syria,

1432
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,290
he,
he's propped up by Iran and by Russia.

1433
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:32,910
And so he's not going anywhere.
I mean,

1434
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:35,040
if you have those two countries as your 
allies,

1435
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:40,041
like you're not going anywhere.
So I think what's going to happen 

1436
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:43,610
ultimately is that isis will be defeated
and the country will be partitioned 

1437
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:46,390
along sectarian lines and they're 
eventually.

1438
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:49,710
There may be a kind of a delicate piece.

1439
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:55,790
It seems like with all those middle 
eastern countries or any country that's 

1440
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:58,821
run by a brutal dictator,
as soon as that dictators removed or as 

1441
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:01,440
soon as somebody dies,
there's this massive power vacuum.

1442
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1443
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:04,470
I mean that would be the argument for 
not trying to remove them.

1444
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:09,471
I mean,
he's a complete criminal and sadist and 

1445
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:10,950
um,
by these horrible.

1446
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:11,190
But yeah.

1447
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,850
Was the argument for keeping saddam 
hussein in power?

1448
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:16,040
It was the argument for keeping kadafi 
and power.

1449
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:16,950
Yeah.
I mean,

1450
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:21,360
basically it's sort of utilitarian 
argument from jaws doraville like what's

1451
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:26,370
gonna,
what's gonna cause the least human 

1452
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:26,370
suffering or promote the most human 
happiness and,

1453
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:26,840
and,
uh,

1454
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:28,140
you know,
sometimes,

1455
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:31,650
um,
I can understand the reasoning behind,

1456
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:32,730
look,
the guy's a dictator,

1457
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:37,731
but we should leave him in place because
the alternative is a lot of other 

1458
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:41,670
innocent people suffering when we remove
him in the country collapses,

1459
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:43,880
this country has already collapsed.
So the pro is,

1460
01:03:43,881 --> 01:03:44,730
or the question is,
okay,

1461
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,630
we make a tentative peace deal with him.
We'll leave you empower.

1462
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,220
We won't try to topple you.
Um,

1463
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,870
but let's stop fighting.
I mean,

1464
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:52,530
I can,
I,

1465
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,390
I could support that.
Yeah.

1466
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,220
Personally.
Wow.

1467
01:03:56,510 --> 01:04:01,510
Crazy.
The idea of keeping that guy in power 

1468
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,650
just so less people suffer and you keep 
a brutal murder as dictator in power.

1469
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,780
Yeah.
And we're better off that way.

1470
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,410
Yeah.
Well,

1471
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:06,920
I mean,
you know,

1472
01:04:06,921 --> 01:04:08,510
the war killed almost half a million 
people,

1473
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,280
so if you want to,
if you want that to continue,

1474
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,970
I mean those are the awful moral 
choices.

1475
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,050
Um,

1476
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,380
it's very frustrating for people though 
because it would like to see.

1477
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,430
We'd like to see some solution like on 
the tape,

1478
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,160
but that doesn't seem

1479
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:24,860
well,
it's a solution to the violence.

1480
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:25,870
I mean,
any,

1481
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,870
any peace deal is a solution to the 
violence.

1482
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,510
So.
And the first thing that has to happen I

1483
01:04:30,511 --> 01:04:33,270
think is that the violence stops so that
people stop dying.

1484
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,080
Um,
the pursuit of justice,

1485
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:40,290
it is a secondary is important,
but it's a secondary matter after that.

1486
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:42,230
W,

1487
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I know you're running out of time here,
so I'm good.

1488
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,320
What,
what brings you,

1489
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:53,310
what brings you satisfaction when you,
when you do something like this 

1490
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,760
documentary or,
or your book tribe?

1491
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,100
Yeah,
I really like the,

1492
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,010
I liked the sort of game of ideas,
right?

1493
01:05:03,011 --> 01:05:08,011
Like I like exploring a topic and 
starting to make sense of it and 

1494
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:09,100
starting to see connections between 
things.

1495
01:05:09,101 --> 01:05:11,700
So when I was writing tribe,
we'd started the,

1496
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:12,050
the,
the,

1497
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:17,070
when the central thesis of it sort of 
occurred to me and all these disparate 

1498
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,410
suddenly align themselves in an orderly 
way.

1499
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:24,610
And I felt like I'd shown a little bit 
of light onto the woRld and shown how it

1500
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:26,740
works.
Like that's totally intoxicating to me.

1501
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:28,510
And likewise,
when you're making your documentary,

1502
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,650
you suddenly start to see themes and 
structures in the film,

1503
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:35,920
in human affairs that they,
they sort of come out and,

1504
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:41,630
and,
and when it and when you work on that 

1505
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:41,630
level,
it's incredible.

1506
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:46,260
To me it's like an incredibly gratifying
and that because that means that I've 

1507
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,160
now made sense of something.
There's a disorderly,

1508
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:52,480
confusing world and I've managed to 
organize it in an understandable way and

1509
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:57,481
that means other people can understand 
it and then we can have a conversation 

1510
01:05:57,481 --> 01:05:58,000
about how the world works and how people
work.

1511
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:03,150
And that to me is the point of 
journalism is the point of all 

1512
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:03,160
intellectual endeavor.
And,

1513
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:06,400
and to be even a small part of it to me 
is incredibly exciting.

1514
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,470
Well,
you nailed it and you,

1515
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:13,471
you definitely nailed it.
And with this the thing I was talking 

1516
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:16,310
about how when it just beginning the 
first chapter,

1517
01:06:16,311 --> 01:06:20,000
I had a real urge to get out of the 
city.

1518
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,760
I had a real urge to like,
there's this thought like,

1519
01:06:22,761 --> 01:06:25,490
could I live in the woods?
Can I live in a tribal society?

1520
01:06:25,491 --> 01:06:26,930
Like,
it seems,

1521
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:33,470
it seems like you were outlining like a,
almost like a mathematical problem.

1522
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,400
Yeah.
Um,

1523
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,010
yeah,
it,

1524
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:37,780
it,
um,

1525
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,360
or chemical,
maybe even a chemical problem.

1526
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:40,930
Well,
you know,

1527
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:45,931
I studied anthropology in college and to
my understanding of humans is that we 

1528
01:06:45,931 --> 01:06:50,581
are social.
We are social primates that prefer to 

1529
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:51,940
live in groups of about 50 people in a,
in a challenging environment.

1530
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:55,370
That's what human beings are.
And uh,

1531
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,970
to the extent that we depart from that,
we,

1532
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,490
we,
uh,

1533
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:04,420
lead lives of dissatisfaction and um,
and frustration.

1534
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,200
And that's how I understand life.
How do you manage that in your own life?

1535
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:10,140
I,
um,

1536
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,420
I mean,
I wish I,

1537
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:17,421
you know,
I wish I was part of a communal group 

1538
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:17,421
fighting to survive in the wilderness.
Like,

1539
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:17,421
I mean,
I,

1540
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:22,191
I had some taste of that with the 
platoon that I was with and that was 

1541
01:07:22,191 --> 01:07:23,740
intoxicating.
It has downsides obviously.

1542
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:25,170
And uh,
uh,

1543
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,770
you can't stay out there forever,
but,

1544
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:31,810
um,
it may be at least understand that the 

1545
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:32,350
source of my dissatisfaction in life 
wasn't internal.

1546
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:33,880
It was,
it made sense.

1547
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:38,881
It was that I was having a healthy 
reaction to circumstances in society 

1548
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:40,870
that,
that humans were not adapted for,

1549
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:46,020
and even that was enough to bring a kind
of peace of mind for me.

1550
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,060
Um,
I also very consciously and deliberately

1551
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:52,330
try to live in places where there is the
possibility of,

1552
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:53,610
of um,
uh,

1553
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:58,730
sort of close communal neighborhood.
I live in a very poor neighborhood in 

1554
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:02,401
New York city at which for some of the 
hassles at least has the sort of rich 

1555
01:08:02,401 --> 01:08:04,540
fabric of human connection that you just
don't get in wealthy neighborhoods.

1556
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,250
So you do it on purpose.
Oh yeah.

1557
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,850
What I don't want to say,
where do you want to say where you live?

1558
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,850
I live in lower east side manhattan and 
um,

1559
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,670
he's not very,
very poor,

1560
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,880
but it's,
it is a dominican,

1561
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:19,020
dominican neighborhood.
Have half the people in that 

1562
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:19,020
neighborhood really don't speak english 
very well.

1563
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,140
So it's not very,
it's a very rich or ethnic neighborhood.

1564
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:22,770
People are quite poor.
Um,

1565
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:27,780
and I,
and I know everybody and everyone knows 

1566
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:27,980
each other by sight and we look out for 
each other and it's during hurricane,

1567
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:31,130
a hurricane.
When hurricane sandy hit New York,

1568
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:36,490
I mean a lot of the people that had 
young children had to leave because 

1569
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:38,861
there was no light,
there was no water or the power was out 

1570
01:08:38,861 --> 01:08:41,591
right to half of manhattan was 
completely dark and it was really 

1571
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:43,740
actually quite dangerous at night in the
dark half of manhattan and uh,

1572
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:46,850
where there was no streetlights and um,
so this building,

1573
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:49,820
it's a tenement building that I live in 
with my wife and um,

1574
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,070
and a lot of the people left and the,
the,

1575
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,570
they were worried about being robbed and
these are poor people,

1576
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:58,370
right?
This is not a wealthy building at all,

1577
01:08:58,371 --> 01:08:59,720
is quite,
quite poor building.

1578
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,260
And so they,
they,

1579
01:09:01,261 --> 01:09:03,530
they organized a guard shift.
One of the people,

1580
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:08,531
one of the women in the building had a 
machete and they organized guard shifts 

1581
01:09:08,531 --> 01:09:08,690
at the front door with a machete and the
young,

1582
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:11,840
the young men in the building took turns
to like two hours at a time guarding the

1583
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:13,580
building with a machete.
Yeah.

1584
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,290
And um,
you know,

1585
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:17,750
I wasn't associated with the building at
that time,

1586
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,410
but boy would that have made me feel 
good to be part of that,

1587
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:21,890
that,
you know what I mean,

1588
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,050
like that is what human beings,
that's what they are.

1589
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:29,740
Is that right?
And you didn't see that in a wealthy 

1590
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,010
neighborhood,
partly because the wealthy neighborhoods

1591
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:36,011
actually had light just seems weird to 
make the choice to live in a community 

1592
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:38,720
like that because of those factors.
Well,

1593
01:09:38,721 --> 01:09:40,160
my wife lived there and I moved in with 
her,

1594
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:40,860
so,
uh,

1595
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:41,850
but,
but the,

1596
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,570
the reason I was happy to move in with 
her,

1597
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:49,571
one of the reasons I was happy to move 
in with her is precisely because it 

1598
01:09:49,571 --> 01:09:49,571
wasn't an affluent neighborhood,
like the kind I grew up in.

1599
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:52,370
That to me is just sold death.
Right.

1600
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:55,490
I mean it just,
I grew up in an affluent suburb and it's

1601
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:59,510
just the most boring thing on the 
planet.

1602
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,360
Like it's deadlY to me.
And,

1603
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,120
and I,
you know,

1604
01:10:02,121 --> 01:10:07,121
like had I not grown up like that,
maybe I'd be living in a neighborhood 

1605
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:07,121
like that.
I mean,

1606
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:10,801
I get it right,
but I did grow up like that and the one 

1607
01:10:10,801 --> 01:10:13,280
thing that I just cannot survive is that
kind of complacent affluence.

1608
01:10:13,281 --> 01:10:18,281
Like it just kills me.
It's so funny because that's the one 

1609
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:21,581
thing that people try to achieve when 
they grow up in that sort of poor 

1610
01:10:21,581 --> 01:10:25,630
community.
They want to get out and live in a big 

1611
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:25,630
house.
The big yard.

1612
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,300
Look at their suicide rates,
their addiction rates,

1613
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,890
their depression rates.
I mean,

1614
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:28,500
seriously,
if you,

1615
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:29,630
uh,
if you look at those,

1616
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,970
uh,
alcoholism,

1617
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:34,610
depression,
suicide in affluent neighborhoods,

1618
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:35,840
I mean,
it's astronomical.

1619
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,520
It's brutal boy,
but try to convince people to abandon 

1620
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,860
that way.
That's where it's really odd.

1621
01:10:42,861 --> 01:10:45,680
It seems like,
so counter intuitive to them.

1622
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:46,580
It's like,
no,

1623
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:46,880
no,
no,

1624
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,140
you're going to live in a safe 
neighborhood.

1625
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:48,320
No,
no,

1626
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:49,420
no.
You're going to have a big house.

1627
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:50,720
You gonna have a nice car and a great 
job.

1628
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:51,680
You're going to do great.
Well,

1629
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,510
think about an evolutionary terms,
terms.

1630
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:58,540
The impulse towards safety and luxury is
a totally healthy one in a situation 

1631
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,110
where nature doesn't offer that very 
often,

1632
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:05,550
right?
So we're programmed to go for those 

1633
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:05,550
things,
right?

1634
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:09,310
What we're not prepared for is to go for
those things and have it happen all the 

1635
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,760
time.
You see what I'm saying?

1636
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,800
Like it's totally healthy instincts of 
course.

1637
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:17,830
Right?
But we didn't involve in a world where 

1638
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:18,810
you could actually achieve that 100 
percent of the time.

1639
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:20,730
I mean,
dogs are programmed,

1640
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,220
a lot of dog species or program will 
will,

1641
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:26,910
will eat until they've eaten so much 
that they'll kill themselves eating.

1642
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:28,850
Right?
It's because there wasn't enough food to

1643
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:31,920
like the programming to keep eating as 
long as their food is great.

1644
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,560
If there's a scarcity of food,
right?

1645
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:38,980
Right.
As soon as there's a plentitude of food 

1646
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:39,090
that becomes maladaptive and the dog 
dies and you know,

1647
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:42,390
likewise,
people put fat on very easily because in

1648
01:11:42,391 --> 01:11:45,990
a harsh environment with not much food,
you have to be able to put fat on easily

1649
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:48,220
or you'll die.
Now with the.

1650
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:53,420
The reason there's so many obese people 
is because we have that impulse to eat 

1651
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:56,310
and eat and eat and the foods there to 
do it with,

1652
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:58,230
and we don't have the mechanism for 
stopping it,

1653
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,200
and so that's why there's so many happy.
Oh,

1654
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:03,740
it's also sugar.
That's a big absolutely.

1655
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:08,430
But our taste for sugar and for fat is 
programmed by evolution,

1656
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:13,720
right?
Because there wasn't much of those 

1657
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,021
things,
so now you can have as much as you want 

1658
01:12:15,021 --> 01:12:15,021
and suddenly people weigh 350 pounds.
Right?

1659
01:12:15,021 --> 01:12:15,240
I mean it's,
it's,

1660
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:20,260
it's evolutionary programming.
Run a muck in a world where there's too 

1661
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:21,780
much of something that was very good but
was very scarce.

1662
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:25,750
You highlight some really profound 
issues with culture in your book,

1663
01:12:25,751 --> 01:12:30,280
but I would wonder if how many people 
come up to you after they've read it and

1664
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:31,600
go,
what do I do?

1665
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:32,980
Like,
you're right,

1666
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,450
you're right,
but what do I do?

1667
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,660
I mean,
here I am.

1668
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:37,180
I'm this guy,
have this house,

1669
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,890
I have a mortgage,
I have kids,

1670
01:12:38,891 --> 01:12:40,810
I have a job that's good and I don't 
want to leave it,

1671
01:12:40,811 --> 01:12:42,280
but what do I do?
Because you're right,

1672
01:12:42,281 --> 01:12:43,880
I'm fucking miserable.
What do you,

1673
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:44,790
what do I do?
Like,

1674
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,270
what do you tell those people?

1675
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:47,100
Um,
I,

1676
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:52,230
I mean,
it really a question of is the question 

1677
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:55,840
you can't have it all and I mean what I 
would say to them is sell your house,

1678
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,250
move in,
sell you car.

1679
01:12:58,251 --> 01:13:03,251
If you can move into a community where 
you have to be into reliant with the 

1680
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:04,000
people around you.
And a,

1681
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:09,001
I have to interact with them everyday.
Like that is what makes people feel 

1682
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:11,981
good.
But the thing is people are 

1683
01:13:11,981 --> 01:13:14,441
understandably not willing to give up 
the pleasures of an affluent life in 

1684
01:13:14,441 --> 01:13:14,600
order to have social connection.
I mean,

1685
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:19,601
I get it right,
but you really can't have both very 

1686
01:13:19,601 --> 01:13:19,601
successfully.
it's extremely hard to.

1687
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:20,420
Yeah.

1688
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:25,510
Body.
My who lived in venice and a real nice 

1689
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:28,750
tight knit community.
They had this called the sac and 

1690
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:28,750
everybody lived in the city.
Everyone,

1691
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,170
everyone knoW everybody.
I live in a cul de sac right there.

1692
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:32,150
Great.
And he started doing well.

1693
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:37,450
And the first thing he did,
he moved out and you've got this really 

1694
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,001
nice house in this big yard.
And he fucking hates it and he's 

1695
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:40,001
miserable and we talk about it.
He goes,

1696
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:40,370
I fucking hate it.
He goes,

1697
01:13:40,371 --> 01:13:41,870
I don't know my neighbors.
He goes,

1698
01:13:41,871 --> 01:13:45,080
I have this big yard.
I just stare at it and go back inside my

1699
01:13:45,081 --> 01:13:46,040
house.
He goes,

1700
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,880
I used to know everyone on the block.
I knew everyone in the community.

1701
01:13:48,881 --> 01:13:48,980
Yeah,

1702
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:49,740
that's right.
Well,

1703
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,240
that guy is.
I mean,

1704
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:55,270
that lifestyle is correlated with higher
depression and suicide rates.

1705
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:57,940
I mean,
he's literally a statistical risk,

1706
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:03,220
uh,
increased statistical risk of suicide 

1707
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:03,220
and depression because of that change.
Wow.

1708
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:04,690
So you,

1709
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,200
regardless of how much money you would 
make,

1710
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:12,201
you would always move into a 
neighborhood where people are relying 

1711
01:14:12,201 --> 01:14:12,201
upon each other and tight to each other.

1712
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,480
Oh yeah.
I'm not.

1713
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,440
Yeah,
absolutely.

1714
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:15,800
I mean,
it's not even a.

1715
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,560
Yeah,
no way.

1716
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:19,240
Or like,
it's not even a choice.

1717
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:19,620
Yeah.
I mean,

1718
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:20,310
I'd be like,
I mean,

1719
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:23,050
I just get instantly depressed in 
affluent neighborhoods.

1720
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,910
Wow.
that's so crazy.

1721
01:14:24,911 --> 01:14:25,220
Yeah.
I mean,

1722
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,620
I crash.
I mean hard.

1723
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:29,080
Do you accumulate any material 
possessions?

1724
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:34,081
Are you.
One of those dudes Was like a notebook 

1725
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:34,081
and a couple of pairs of shoes

1726
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:34,081
mean minimally,
but yeah,

1727
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:36,970
I mean we live in a very small apartment
so there's not room for much.

1728
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,240
But

1729
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,170
uh,
are you happy with that?

1730
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,330
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1731
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,010
yeah.
I mean listen,

1732
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:48,011
the less you have,
the happier you are at the end of the 

1733
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:50,590
day.
Like you could probably make that as a 

1734
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:50,590
empirically true statement.
Empirically.

1735
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:50,590
True.
we really,

1736
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:51,680
and I'm not,
it isn't.

1737
01:14:51,681 --> 01:14:54,200
I'm not talking about poverty,
lack of food,

1738
01:14:54,201 --> 01:14:59,201
lack of resources.
I mean I'm obviously not talking about 

1739
01:14:59,201 --> 01:14:59,201
that.
I'm talking about material

1740
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:02,670
possession,
stopped cars and boats and shit.

1741
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:05,040
I always feel like once you get a boat 
you're probably falling,

1742
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:08,640
falling apart,
you know what I mean?

1743
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:11,090
Like unless you're a fisherman,
you know,

1744
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,570
you're going out there and getting a 
boat.

1745
01:15:12,571 --> 01:15:13,920
It's like what?
You just,

1746
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,000
you know,
what are you doing?

1747
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:15,610
Well,
you know,

1748
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,310
it's interesting like that kind of 
mature,

1749
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:21,340
those kind of material possessions also.
They mean again,

1750
01:15:21,341 --> 01:15:22,150
evolution,
right?

1751
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:24,760
Like a particularly for males in the 
society.

1752
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:27,040
If you control resources,
you,

1753
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:32,160
you have a reproductive advantage over 
males that don't control resources and 

1754
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:32,470
you knoW,
girls will like you better.

1755
01:15:32,471 --> 01:15:34,810
Right?
So when you're an 18 year old boy,

1756
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,200
the instinct to get a car,
to get a boat baby one day to get a 

1757
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,530
private area,
you know what a private airplane,

1758
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:46,531
whatever.
That instinct has huge evolutionary 

1759
01:15:46,531 --> 01:15:46,900
advantage because it gives you access to
women.

1760
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:52,350
Not all women but enough.
So that's a great strategy for meeting 

1761
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:52,350
girls,
right?

1762
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:56,790
The problem is that once you're sort of 
further on in your life and you have 

1763
01:15:58,361 --> 01:16:00,340
children,
you have a family,

1764
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:06,870
if you don't have a community and what 
you have instead is a huge lawn and 

1765
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:11,341
overpowered boat and a ridiculously 
expensive car you have.

1766
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:14,080
You have taken things that were,
that were,

1767
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:19,200
that were a definite reproductive 
advantage at 18 and you have dragged 

1768
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:23,650
them into midlife where instead of 
making you feel good,

1769
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:25,400
they will depress you.
In my opinion.

1770
01:16:25,401 --> 01:16:27,220
Like that's,
that's What happens to those guys.

1771
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:32,910
So it was not that those things are 
still a stupid idea at a earlier point 

1772
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:33,190
in your life,
but definitely when you're 50 years old,

1773
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:39,240
again,
I'm sure like you could call if you did 

1774
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:39,240
a proper study,
you could,

1775
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,490
you could make a correlation between 
those kinds of material,

1776
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:44,870
possession at alcohol abuse,

1777
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:45,920
depression,
suicide,

1778
01:16:45,921 --> 01:16:50,921
all that stuff.
I wonder if that's the case with like 

1779
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:53,390
rappers and people that grow up in these
poor black communities that go onto have

1780
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:58,450
a insane material wealth.
I've always been fascinated by the 

1781
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:03,080
ridiculous hip hop culture of just giant
houses and 50 cars and throwing money up

1782
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:08,081
into the air and just this celebration 
of excess coming from a place of nothing

1783
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:10,730
and having deep desire

1784
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:15,730
to,
to achieve all those things that seemed 

1785
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:15,730
unattainable.

1786
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:15,730
Look,
I mean,

1787
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:15,730
I think athletes have the same problem 
too,

1788
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:16,630
you know,
and particularly,

1789
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:21,631
I mean,
they have the fraternity of their team 

1790
01:17:21,631 --> 01:17:22,000
until they retire and apparently retired
athletes,

1791
01:17:22,001 --> 01:17:24,400
professional athletes are real risk of 
depression.

1792
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:25,550
Yes.
Um,

1793
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,010
and uh,
I mean,

1794
01:17:27,011 --> 01:17:32,011
listen,
I met a young woman who had survived 

1795
01:17:32,011 --> 01:17:32,260
cancer and she said to me rather 
sheepishly,

1796
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,400
she said,
you know,

1797
01:17:33,401 --> 01:17:34,360
when I,
when I was sick,

1798
01:17:34,361 --> 01:17:36,580
she was on a cancer ward and she knew 
all the other cancer,

1799
01:17:36,581 --> 01:17:41,581
suffers service,
suffers on the ward and her family and 

1800
01:17:41,581 --> 01:17:41,581
her,
it's her.

1801
01:17:41,581 --> 01:17:45,391
Basically,
her tribe rallied around her and she 

1802
01:17:45,391 --> 01:17:47,101
didn't know if she was going to survive,
she would undergoing chemo and all that 

1803
01:17:47,101 --> 01:17:48,010
awful awful stuff.
And she looked at me sheepishly and said

1804
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:53,020
no,
and I survived and now I missed being 

1805
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,100
sick.
She missed the community of,

1806
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:57,670
of,
of cancer sufferers on that ward.

1807
01:17:57,671 --> 01:18:00,160
And in her own community that rallied 
around her.

1808
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:05,161
She,
she was lonely soldiers missing war and 

1809
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:07,270
cancer survivors are missing cancer.
Like something's missing.

1810
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,440
Yeah.
So the,

1811
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:13,550
well,
there's a struggle that's missing for 

1812
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:13,550
sure.
You know,

1813
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,170
in my own life,
I'm a,

1814
01:18:14,171 --> 01:18:15,980
I'm a,
I'm a very addictive personality,

1815
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:21,010
addictive personality,
and I've found a lot of happiness in a 

1816
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,860
martial arts.
And one of the things about martial arts

1817
01:18:23,861 --> 01:18:25,210
is,
particularlY in jujitsu,

1818
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,760
because it's one of the rare martial 
arts,

1819
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:31,790
you could practice going 100 percent and
not really hurt each other too much 

1820
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:32,770
because you're not,
you're not hitting each other,

1821
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:37,830
right?
You just choking each other and tapping 

1822
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,830
each other out and stuff.
But this,

1823
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:41,521
there's A camaraderie and a bond between
people that choke each other all the 

1824
01:18:41,521 --> 01:18:43,960
time that you just don't see with other 
men or I don't see.

1825
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:45,130
Well yeah,
listen,

1826
01:18:45,131 --> 01:18:45,900
I hear you.
But I,

1827
01:18:45,901 --> 01:18:50,110
I mean I started when I,
when my marriage started falling apart,

1828
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,460
I started boxing,
right?

1829
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,890
And I just needed something.
I'd always been a pretty intense athlete

1830
01:18:53,891 --> 01:18:58,891
when I was young that I was starting to 
smoke cigarettes and drank for a while 

1831
01:18:58,891 --> 01:19:02,161
and then suddenly on my life's in crisis
at 15 and I started going to a boxing 

1832
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:02,830
gym,
mendez boxing in New York city.

1833
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:05,130
So I have 50 year learnIng how to box.
Yeah.

1834
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:09,190
And I'd always had a pretty intense 
relationship with my body as an athlete.

1835
01:19:09,191 --> 01:19:10,660
Right.
So I wasn't starting from zero.

1836
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,180
I've always been in really good shape.
Um,

1837
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,600
and,
but I had never boxed before and I'd 

1838
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:18,670
never done anything like that.
And what I loved about mendez,

1839
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:21,220
it's an old gym in New York and it's 
like leeson's.

1840
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:22,690
It's in manhattan.
And uh,

1841
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:28,080
what I loved about it is that there were
some very tough kids from the outer 

1842
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:28,080
boroughs,
right?

1843
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,120
There was like suits that would come in 
from wall street at lunchtime to box.

1844
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:33,340
There was women,
there was all kinds of people,

1845
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,140
wealthy people,
poor people,

1846
01:19:35,141 --> 01:19:35,710
black,
white,

1847
01:19:35,711 --> 01:19:37,360
whatever it was.
Every everyone's in there,

1848
01:19:37,361 --> 01:19:39,940
right?
What I loved about it is that no one,

1849
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,430
no one brought their street identity 
into the,

1850
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,740
into the gym,
right?

1851
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,810
You were,
it's just like a platoon in combat.

1852
01:19:46,811 --> 01:19:49,540
You weren't,
you were judged in there not for whether

1853
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:52,510
you're young and black and poor or 
wealthy and affluent and white,

1854
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:55,000
whatever,
but how you act in the gym.

1855
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,360
And there was no prejudice that I can 
see against the young black kids that 

1856
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:03,361
are in there.
But there's also no prejudice against 

1857
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:03,361
the wealthy white guys break.
As long as you leave it at that street,

1858
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:09,300
you,
whoever you are in that space and you 

1859
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,171
get all the respect you want,
if you act well and that is the deep 

1860
01:20:12,171 --> 01:20:15,471
egalitarian ism of a tribal society,
you're judged by how you act and that's 

1861
01:20:15,471 --> 01:20:15,471
it.

1862
01:20:15,471 --> 01:20:20,420
That's the same thing.
Which schools you're judged by your 

1863
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:20,550
effort and how well you can perform on 
the mats.

1864
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:21,660
Right?
And don't listen.

1865
01:20:21,661 --> 01:20:23,220
I'm a middle aged.
I'm a middle aged guy,

1866
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:23,700
right?
I mean,

1867
01:20:23,701 --> 01:20:25,430
I'm never going to win a championship.
I mean I've never.

1868
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:30,660
I mean,
what am I going to do professionally 

1869
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:30,660
with boxing?
It's not happening,

1870
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:30,660
but I woke up really,
really hard.

1871
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,550
I'm not afraid to get hit like,
and I have all the.

1872
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:38,030
I mean everyone in the gym knows me and 
I have all the respect I could ever 

1873
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:40,971
want.
And through that struggle also you 

1874
01:20:40,971 --> 01:20:42,390
achieved some feeling of peace because 
you're strong.

1875
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,040
I mean,
it's a brutal struggle.

1876
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:47,850
Boxing for people who've never tried it.
It's unbelievably exhausting.

1877
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:53,200
I,
I mean I thought for 12 mile was the 

1878
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,620
hardest thing I could imagine.
I had no idea what a one hour session,

1879
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:59,040
like a really intense one hour training 
session was like much less sparring,

1880
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,990
much left getting hit in the liver.

1881
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,660
Yeah.
I just,

1882
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:05,330
I mean annihilating and,
and um,

1883
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:08,310
but I was in a lot of psychic pain and I
needed.

1884
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:14,360
Yeah,
I really feel like I'm especially 

1885
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,911
physical struggle.
I mean there's a lot of people that are 

1886
01:21:16,911 --> 01:21:18,150
averse to exercise and like,
I can't stress it enough.

1887
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:20,940
I think the body needs physical 
struggle.

1888
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:25,941
I think if you don't,
I think there's an overflow of energy 

1889
01:21:25,941 --> 01:21:28,680
and stress that's unmanaged and it 
manifests itself in a very physical way.

1890
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,110
There was a,
there was a study that I read of,

1891
01:21:31,111 --> 01:21:33,640
um,
I mean there were a few hundred gatherer

1892
01:21:33,641 --> 01:21:38,641
societies that are still in existence 
and the average amount of physical 

1893
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:41,190
activity in subsistence level,
hunter gatherer societies,

1894
01:21:41,191 --> 01:21:42,810
which of course is our evolutionary 
past.

1895
01:21:42,811 --> 01:21:45,570
I mean that's what we are designed to 
do,

1896
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,920
um,
is something like two hours of hard 

1897
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,900
walking per day on average men and women
moved like vigorously for two hours a 

1898
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:56,220
day,
usually walking quickly.

1899
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:01,370
Right?
That's what our bodies are designed for 

1900
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,990
and it's what if we do that,
we're that we're tuned up at that level,

1901
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:05,430
right?
We're where our mind feels good,

1902
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:07,770
our bodies feel good,
and if you don't do that,

1903
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,810
I mean you can lay around all day,
but it will not.

1904
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,290
You will,
you will experience a death,

1905
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,900
a psychological deficit and a physical 
deficit.

1906
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,300
Yeah,
I think that,

1907
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:21,870
I mean there's no way to make people do 
it,

1908
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:27,230
but I think if you could give people 
advice that would be one of the big 

1909
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:27,230
ones.
And you know,

1910
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:29,010
in western society,
the older you get,

1911
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,230
the more money you tend to have more 
sedentary,

1912
01:22:31,231 --> 01:22:36,231
you are.
And there's a corresponding decline in 

1913
01:22:36,231 --> 01:22:36,630
testosterone levels in males.
Right?

1914
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:41,870
What they found in these very mobile 
physical societies is that testosterone 

1915
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:44,070
levels in males really didn't decline 
until the seventies,

1916
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,810
seventies,
the seventies.

1917
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,860
I mean,
decline slowly,

1918
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:51,861
but it didn't go off a cliff like it 
does in our society at five or whatever 

1919
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:55,191
it is.
Like it was a gradual decline and if 

1920
01:22:55,191 --> 01:22:55,191
there was a cliff,
it was in the mid seventies.

1921
01:22:55,191 --> 01:22:56,910
And that's because,
I mean,

1922
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
the theory was that it was because that 
constant intense physical activity 

1923
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:06,040
testosterone allows for it,
but that activity actually keeps those

1924
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,500
levels high and it's a symbiotic 
relationship.

1925
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:10,690
No,
it completely makes sense for one of the

1926
01:23:10,691 --> 01:23:13,240
things that they prescribed a middle 
aged man is sprints,

1927
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:16,210
you know,
run up hills like a carry heavy things.

1928
01:23:16,211 --> 01:23:21,211
Do squats,
do things that stimulate your entire 

1929
01:23:21,211 --> 01:23:21,570
body.
We're boxing or boxing.

1930
01:23:21,571 --> 01:23:22,870
Yeah.
All those things.

1931
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:24,070
Listen,
man,

1932
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:29,110
uh,
I've taken up enough of your time and I 

1933
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,841
really appreciate it and I'm really 
enjoying your book and I'm looking 

1934
01:23:30,841 --> 01:23:33,550
forward to a documentary and it's hell 
on earth and it's available this sunday.

1935
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,650
What time does it say up there?
What time?

1936
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:36,890
It is?
11.

1937
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,050
Oh,
an nice june.

1938
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:39,400
11th,
nine eastern,

1939
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:41,320
eight central.
And uh,

1940
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:42,910
I've,
I've enjoyed your work over the years,

1941
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:47,911
man.
So it was a real pleasure to sit down 

1942
01:23:47,911 --> 01:23:47,911
and talk to you.
I really enjoyed this conversation.

1943
01:23:47,911 --> 01:23:47,911
Was really,
really nice.

1944
01:23:47,911 --> 01:23:49,000
Great conversation.
