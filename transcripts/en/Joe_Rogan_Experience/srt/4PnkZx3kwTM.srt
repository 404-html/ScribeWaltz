1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
The Gay folks took over the rainbow

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,870
for three to,

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,930
will it work today,
Jamie?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,210
Yes. Hello Nicholas. Hey Joe. How
are you man? Great to meet you.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,980
It's really good to meet you too.
Ah,

6
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:21,981
I became aware of you like many people
did with the infamous Halloween costume

7
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,260
incident at Yale. Uh, where, uh,

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,730
explain that for people who don't know
what happened cause it was kind of a

9
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:34,140
crazy scene. It went national.
Yes, it was a moment when, uh,

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,100
around the country,

11
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:39,610
many students were struggling with
how to balance the conflicting, um,

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,880
sort of needs a little bit closer to your
face. They are conflicting needs. Uh,

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,330
uh, how on the one hand to create an
environment at schools where people,

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,370
everyone sort of felt welcome
as we've democratized, uh,

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,350
admissions to our American universities
is I think we should have people from

16
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,680
all walks of life have started moving
into these institutions claiming them for

17
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:03,150
their own,
which I think is appropriate.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,650
But at the same time these institutions
had wonderful heritage is of commitment

19
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,280
to free expression and open debate and um,

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,760
and reason as a principal for
resolving our differences.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,170
And US and some of those values came
into tension. And so around the country,

22
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,930
there was a lot of heat about this.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,870
And I happened to walk into
a propeller, uh, myself and,

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,930
and wound up, um, in some
challenging circumstances.

25
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,270
And, um, you know, I, I, it was not,

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,920
it was not the worst thing that's
ever happened to me, but, you know,

27
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:44,040
it was sitting in the top 10, uh,
challenging moments I've had in my life,

28
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,590
let's say. Yeah, that's a very lawyer,

29
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:48,510
like way of describing
exactly what happened.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,140
I mean, the thing is, I, you know, I,
I, I, you know, I struggle. I mean,

31
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:57,600
you can tell the story if you want
and then I can correct things.

32
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:58,710
But here's the thing,
it's,

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,920
it's my job to be a teacher and I have
taken responsibility for teaching young

34
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,160
people.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,990
And it is the case that many
people lost their minds.

36
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:13,650
I mean, lost their senses. And, and, and
the faculty too, incidentally. I mean,

37
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:15,980
you know, there, it's one thing
to talk about people in there,

38
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,540
in college age people, but then, you know,

39
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,600
the faculty also didn't necessarily
do what they should've done, but, um,

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,500
but the thing is, is that,
you know, my commitment,

41
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,470
my commitment is to,
is to teaching more generally.

42
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:33,400
And I don't want to be defined by that
event. I don't want that to become a,

43
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,160
the most important thing about me,
you know,

44
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,260
have this book or this book that we're
going to talk about that is an important

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,410
thing in my life.
Instantiates my values.

46
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,080
It talks about what I think is
important about the world. So,

47
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,620
so I'm trying to be balanced about it.
Just, it's one thing that happened.

48
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,200
I did my best. It's in
the past. So let me,

49
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,110
let me help out here because you're
being so nice about the whole thing. Um,

50
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,020
so people know what we're talking about.
There was a,

51
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,100
an incident that was on someone's

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,290
cell phone where you were standing
here, people, it was an hour of footage,

53
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,910
five or six different angles.
So a clip went viral,

54
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,740
but I want to emphasize that there were
many people filming that day and an hour

55
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,350
or more of the two or three hours
I was out there as available.

56
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,980
But I'm glad that you had the
courage to do that though,

57
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,600
to stand out there and talk to those kids.
But some of them were clearly,

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,680
there's something that happens when people
become extremely self indulgent when

59
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,570
they know that they have
this platform and they, uh,

60
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,240
have someone who is in a
position of authority and
they get to hamstring them in

61
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:37,240
front of the public.
And that's what I felt was going on to,

62
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,450
is my understanding of human nature.
I knew what she was doing,

63
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,790
what she was doing by shouting
and screaming, this is our
fucking home. You know,

64
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,180
w, you know, we were supposed
to be safe here. I was like,
oh, I see what's going on.

65
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,650
She's throwing up the flag of virtue for
all of her friends to see how amazing

66
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,940
she was. So she's putting
on a show. People do that.
It's, it's, it's human nature.

67
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,570
You handled it admirably.
You stood there and you,

68
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,730
you just listened to her and you never
yelled back and you never raise your

69
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:08,770
voice and you remained calm.

70
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:13,771
But that sort of environment
where the children,

71
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,770
and I want to say children,
they're basically adults,
but acting like children.

72
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,890
This is one of the ironies that
the people that age, you know,

73
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:23,860
can fight in wars and lose their lives.

74
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,410
And so I think it's a,

75
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,800
it's a difficult challenge because on the
one hand it's right and appropriate to

76
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,550
hold people responsible for their actions.
Certainly if you're 20 years old,

77
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:36,370
you're an adult, you're still
growing, you're still changing,

78
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,150
you're still learning.

79
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,150
I'm not the same man I was when I was 20
but you have to be responsible for your

80
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:46,990
behavior. Yes. I don't think you get
a total pass either. It's hard now.

81
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:49,240
You do not get a total pass.
And you know,

82
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,480
for folks who don't have a 20 year old
in their life and don't remember what it

83
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:59,620
was like, you know, you're not a
fully formed thing yet. You're,

84
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:03,700
you're filled with chaos,
emotions and hormones and yes.

85
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,880
And then you're at school and you're
probably a way from the instructions of

86
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:13,750
your parents for the first time and you
know you're cutting loose and trying out

87
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:18,670
new new ways of communicating that
way. It's, it's a lot of, it's a mess.

88
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,850
But most people felt
horrified watching that,

89
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,640
that you were subjected to that
when you're being very reasonable.

90
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,640
And also what it all came about was your
wife had sent out an email saying like,

91
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:31,750
hey,

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,750
maybe it should be okay for someone
to wear a fucked up Halloween costume.

93
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,120
You know, maybe it's okay to, for someone
to dress up like crazy horse. We have,

94
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,580
well we'll actually, just
to be clear, what Erica was
saying in that note was not,

95
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,980
this is very important intellectual
distinction. I think we've,

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,730
we've lost a lot of nuance in our
political lives in general in our country

97
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,480
right now.
And also in the,

98
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,980
in the nuance and the way we think about
difficult topics. So Erica was saying

99
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,950
was not that necessarily the people,

100
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,620
she was not taking a position on any
particular costumes like this is okay.

101
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:03,921
In fact,

102
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,740
many of the costumes that would have
offended the students would offend her.

103
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,990
But she was saying was that she didn't
think the university should be telling

104
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,170
students what to wear.
And she was asking the students,

105
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,320
do you students really
at this age at Yale,

106
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,750
do you really want the university to be
sending you guidance on what to where?

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,060
Perhaps you should think about
that. You're adults, you're smart,

108
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,090
you're in an environment that
privileges free expression.

109
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,420
Do you really want to grab the power
to an institution to tell you how to

110
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,763
communicate?

111
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,070
And people then a thought
that she was saying that, uh,

112
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,460
that she was defending a particular course
of action. What she was saying was, um,

113
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,400
you, uh, she was saying,

114
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,030
do you students really want to surrender
that kind of control over your own

115
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:57,590
lives to older adults? And apparently
many students did actually. They wanted,

116
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,160
they did. They did. So I
don't believe they did.

117
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,220
I think they wanted absolute enforcement
of what they thought to be wrong or

118
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:11,720
right. Yes. Yes. I think that's
right. So they, they, they,

119
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:16,580
uh, they did the many but not
all of the students. I mean,

120
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:21,310
let's, let's also be very clear
and in part of the motivation in,

121
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,760
in Erica a writing that
note was that, uh, many, uh,

122
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,810
many of her students and in fact
many hundreds of other students felt

123
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,730
infantilized by this policy.

124
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,220
And there had been a big
buildup prior to that event,

125
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,160
including an article in the New York
Times about these Halloween costume

126
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:40,220
policies around the country and
weren't they kind of ridiculous.

127
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,630
And so there was a, there was a kind of
a, a ferment where people were saying,

128
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,040
wait a minute, do we really need
adults to be told in this institution,

129
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:53,480
especially given its commitments
to open expression, uh,

130
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,463
what to wear.

131
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,330
And keep in mind that there could be
many ways in which a costume that offends

132
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,480
you might not, might,
I might not know why.

133
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:07,160
So let's say you had been abused by a
priest and you were that one of the rules

134
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:10,620
said you shouldn't, a mock religion
for example, was what one of the Pr,

135
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,150
one of the provisions. So, so a
a university wide email went out,

136
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:18,980
signed by 13 people saying,
um, you know, don't, don't, uh,

137
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,760
don't mock people's deeply
held faith traditions. Well,

138
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,050
what if for the sake of argument,

139
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:28,340
you had been abused by a priest and you
want it in Halloween to dress up as a

140
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,710
Catholic priest, for
example. Uh, you know,

141
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,880
holding a doll and someone
else who had a different,

142
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,390
who was Catholic was very
deeply offended by that. Well,

143
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,530
who should adjudicate
that? Like, you know,

144
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,630
is it the role of the institution
to come down and say, yes,

145
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,240
you can express yourself
this way. No, you cannot.

146
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,650
And so the argument was
let the young people learn,

147
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,160
let them sort it out themselves.
Let them learn by talking to each other,

148
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,860
expressing themselves, saying,
you know, that hurts my feelings.

149
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,100
Here's why it hurts my feelings. And
the other person say, oh, I understand,

150
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:04,600
or I don't understand, I
reject that reason. And,

151
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,570
and sort of buy into a kind of commitment
to free and open expression that

152
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,670
actually I think ultimately serves the
objectives of righteous social progress.

153
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,140
If we really want to do better in our
society or in any society in my view,

154
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,410
we have to create an environment where
we can talk to each other, grant,

155
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,410
good faith, uh, listen carefully,

156
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,730
make subtle distinctions and,

157
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,440
and free people up to express what
they're thinking so we can have a real

158
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,880
marketplace of ideas. That's, you
know, my commitment or my belief.

159
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,200
Well that's a wonderful belief. I
love it. I mean that's really a,

160
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,770
I couldn't agree with you more,
more enthusiastically.

161
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,210
That's really,

162
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,740
that sounds like the best possible
environment for growing up and learning.

163
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:54,741
As long as you have someone to sort of
moderate or someone to mediate if things

164
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,210
go sideways.
Yes.

165
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:00,720
Or I don't think you necessarily
need a third party mediator,

166
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:03,820
but you do need a shared understanding of,

167
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,740
of a core liberal principles.
And these principles do include,

168
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,040
as I mentioned earlier, I kind of
commitment to free and open expression,

169
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,350
a commitment to debate,
a commitment to reason.

170
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,190
So how are you and I going to come to
a better understanding of what is true

171
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:20,250
about the world we could
fight, right? And then the,

172
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,150
the stronger person would decide
what's right. We could vote.

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Doesn't seem quite right either.
You know,

174
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:31,200
a 350 cardinals voted that Galileo was
wrong. That didn't make Galileo wrong.

175
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,870
Or we could use principles of reason,

176
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,230
an inquiry to try to appreciate
the world together, right?

177
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:40,170
We're looking out at the world and
saying, that's confusing. You know,

178
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,220
does the sun,

179
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,370
does the earth revolve around the sun or
does the sun revolve around the earth?

180
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,640
Or that's confusing. Should a
king have monarch, you know,

181
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:51,570
should a king has ultimate authority in
a state or is that not how we want to

182
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:56,190
organize a state? So we, you and I look
at the world and debate and think about,

183
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:56,640
okay,

184
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,640
and we exchange reasons and we use
evidence and ways of understanding and

185
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,450
studying the world. That to me is
the only way to truth. Actually. Now,

186
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:09,360
some people will think that
religion is a way to truth, right?

187
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:12,300
They think that the truth is, you
know, has god given. For example,

188
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:15,390
now I am very sympathetic
to religious belief systems,

189
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,820
but I don't think that's a way
to truth that it's a way to,

190
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:21,750
some truths actually it's a way
to some some wisdom, but anyway,

191
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,360
so that's what our
universities and our society,

192
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,560
our universities are officially committed
to that the mottos of our universities

193
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:33,561
are all about free inquiry and pursuit
of knowledge and our country is committed

194
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,010
to that in our bill of rights,
right.

195
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,310
We have a commitment to free and
open expression, freedom of assembly,

196
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:42,750
freedom of religion and so forth and,
and those ground rules then in my view,

197
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:46,590
make it possible for us to
have a better society and,

198
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,850
and there's more academic. Well, I'm sure
we will get into it. No, I'm sure we will.

199
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,980
Again, I couldn't agree
with you more. Yeah. I

200
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,540
just think we need more
reasonable conversations and
the screaming and shouting

201
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,470
people down and less toxic
mob action. Yes. Yes.

202
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:07,471
The mob action is very weird because I
don't remember it well from the like from

203
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:13,780
the Vietnam war protests
to what's going on today.

204
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:18,781
There was this long gap where you didn't
hear about university shutting down

205
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:23,110
speech.
This is fairly new.

206
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,690
This is within the last half decade or so.

207
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,630
Well let's not yet. Yes, yes.
I mean they're always there.

208
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,950
There's always an undercurrent
of tension about this at,

209
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,070
at universities and in our
society at large. Uh, you know,

210
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:40,150
let's not forget the McCarthy era where
you had the right wing was, you know,

211
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,140
really interested in
shutting down communists.

212
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:46,550
Like if you were a professor or an
artist who had far left political views,

213
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,640
you were screwed and that's what's wrong.

214
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,390
Or even if you would want
went to a communist meeting,

215
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,610
find out what it was
all about. Yes. Just to,

216
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,160
yes, yes. In fact,

217
00:12:56,161 --> 00:13:00,030
that's a great example because that's
like right now I see a lot of people being

218
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,050
criticized for following online
people they disagree with,

219
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,800
which is nuts. Crazy. So I just,

220
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,680
because I follow someone doesn't mean
I agree with what they're saying.

221
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:13,720
I'm interested to learn. What are
they saying? I'm friends with people.

222
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:17,310
I don't agree with me too. I'm friends
with so many people that go to agree with.

223
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,300
I have a friend, I have, I have friends
across the political spectrum from the,

224
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,450
I don't have any monarch. Yes. Among
my president reservoir or Monica.

225
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,000
But I have friends with
the far right to far left.

226
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,060
I have a friend who really
believes he's sold libertarian.

227
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:34,770
He thinks there should be
private ownership of roads.
Uh, whoa. Yeah. I mean,

228
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,440
yeah, I think that's ridiculous.
And we debate. He, you know,

229
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,170
must be white is actually

230
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,080
my wife says she would just once like
to meet a poor libertarian female

231
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:52,470
libertarian. Yes. No. Yeah. That's
a ridiculous position. I think so.

232
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,910
Private roads get the fuck
out of it. Yeah. Okay. But so
here's the thing, but okay,

233
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,020
how are we going to
persuade this man that he's,

234
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,130
he also thinks somewhat
less controversially.

235
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,700
It's harder decision. He also
thinks that you, you shouldn't be,

236
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:08,040
you should be able to sell your
book, your organs. You know,

237
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,070
we should have a market and
kidneys, uh, that you, you know,

238
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:15,570
you right now you're alive. Yeah. You can
give away one of your kidneys, but yeah,

239
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:18,990
you can, we allow you to give it
away. But we don't allow you to

240
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,720
sell it. Wasn't there an instance,
Jamie, that you were telling me about,

241
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:24,300
about a young guy who was sold
as kidney to get an iPhone?

242
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,910
Does that in another country,
another country? Yes. Yes.

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,640
And wound up having an infection and
lost his second kidney as well. Yes.

244
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,670
And then would need to be under yes.
These things. Yeah. And these things,

245
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,060
these things happen in the, but in
the United States, it's prohibited.

246
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:41,220
You can't do that. You also can't
sell your blood in the United States.

247
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:44,040
There's a reason for that.
Yes. And that's a good reason.

248
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,120
A good public health reason.
Yeah.

249
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:47,510
Because people who want to sell
their blood are usually fun.

250
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,130
Correct.
And so it's not a safe,

251
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:54,740
the blood supply is in countries where
you were people terribly altruistically

252
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:58,430
doing it. Exactly, yes. But the kidney is
a harder case anyway. He believes that he,

253
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,020
he, he, anyway, so I love debating him
and I learned from it. Like recently,

254
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:06,620
he said to me and I, and I think
I have a better answer. He said,

255
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:08,720
he doesn't understand
why blackmail is illegal,

256
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,820
but a point is it goes hand or kiss,
anarchists and Libertarians,

257
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:21,350
all of them need their asses
kicked there. Really do. Exactly.

258
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,970
But the, these are like, and I
think 80 kind of extreme ideology,

259
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:30,830
but the point is we can learn,
there is some wisdom almost anywhere,

260
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,720
right? And, and the problem comes
from excess expression. You know, the,

261
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:39,670
the, the problem comes from, um, you
know, there's, there's, there, there,

262
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,350
there the problem comes,
you know,

263
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:44,900
when we take things to extremes
and we get to, you know,

264
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:48,530
private ownership of roads.
But anyway, and by the way,

265
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,110
if you're an anarchist or a libertarian,
I'm kidding.

266
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,500
I don't really pitch when you get your
ass kicked. I'm just joking around.

267
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,680
But it is a mob after,

268
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,770
it's a position that I always feel like
to be remedied with psychedelic drugs.

269
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,390
It could be, yes. Almost always
could be. Like, I get, you know,

270
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,370
I just, I get where they're coming from.
I understand personal responsibility.

271
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,800
The idea that the free market
should decide, get all that,

272
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,190
but we are ready except that there's some
things that we agree on that we should

273
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:24,140
all chip in to pay for. Like, like roads.
Yeah. Or like assessment abilities.

274
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,720
Well yeah, are like assessment
of drug purity for example.

275
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:30,020
So the very rich could set up
a laboratory in their basement.

276
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,850
So whenever a doctor
prescribes a medication,

277
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:36,500
they could see if the drugs are safe
and pure. The rest of us pay taxes.

278
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,190
Now we say we're all going to pitch in
together and we're going to have the FDA

279
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,090
and they are going to certify drug purity
so that when I go to my pharmacist and

280
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:44,924
by a drug,

281
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,290
the pharmaceutical companies and killing
me by shotty manufacturing practices.

282
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,410
Yes.
So I think that's right.

283
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,070
We get together and as a free
society and we do these things,

284
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:57,980
we want a non-corrupt judiciary.
Right?

285
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,570
We don't want people to be able to
bribe judges. Shore. Exactly. Yeah.

286
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,840
So there are certain foundational elements
of our civilization of our society,

287
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,240
which are crucial to our wellbeing.

288
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:13,241
And one of them is the capacity to openly
debate ideas and to expose ourselves

289
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,600
to ideas across the gamut. And I'm not
just talking about political ideas,

290
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,430
I'm talking about scientific ideas.

291
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,790
So how are we going to win the
battle against anti-vaxxers?

292
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,020
Like how are we going to persuade people
who believe that vaccines killed people

293
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:29,930
for which there is no scientific
evidence that they're wrong.

294
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,460
We could imprison them like
that's force. Uh, we could vote,

295
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,050
which is sort of what we're
doing. We're saying, okay,

296
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:39,050
well you're a minority group who believes
these things so we're not going to

297
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:40,670
allow you to control policy.

298
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,690
Or we could try to win the battle of
ideas and persuade them. Ultimately,

299
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:49,560
that's the only path in my view that
gets us to where we want to be. Yeah.

300
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,453
And

301
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,090
just an honest assessment
of the actual data,

302
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,050
like what we really know and understanding
how the scientists come to these

303
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:58,770
conclusions.

304
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,580
But the problem is these echo chambers
where people get involved with online

305
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,850
that magnify all of these
beliefs and you get radicalized.

306
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,790
I mean, I've seen true people get
involved in these Facebook groups.

307
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,210
He's anti-vaxxer faces or
Facebook groups or you know, all,

308
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,560
all sorts of different things.

309
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,540
I mean that's how these
flat earth people get going.

310
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,400
They start listening only to people
that are involved in this circle.

311
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,510
They don't have a greater understanding
of the science involved in,

312
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:27,891
did you just see,

313
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:32,450
I just saw online their sec a cruise
to the flat or cruise for a flat earth.

314
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:34,850
I don't know if you saw it too.
The ice wall. Yeah, the ice wall.

315
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,670
Ooh,
that's a new wrinkle.

316
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:44,510
Cause the old flat earthers used to think
that the water was shown falling off

317
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:47,590
the disc of the earth. You know, like the
edge of the earth. They was just a disc.

318
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,020
Now the new theory that
there's an ice wall, actually,

319
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,300
it's kind of not falsifiable B,
that is to say you,

320
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,560
you could get on a cruise and sail to the
edge of the earth and you would find a

321
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:02,540
wall of ice there. So you
Antarctica. So you'd think,
Huh, it's flat. In other words,

322
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,330
they,
they,

323
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,330
they have redefined their theory too to
make it so that you can't disprove it.

324
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,300
Right. You don't get to
an edge, there's no edge.

325
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,980
There's an ice wall is
what they're saying. No.

326
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,600
And Are you aware of Hashtag
spaces fake? No, I'm not.

327
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:18,220
I have to say it right

328
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,370
and not expose myself to that space.

329
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,960
There's a bunch of people that believe
that space is fake, but it's not real.

330
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,820
But there's no real space and
that there's like lights up there.

331
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,250
Oh and that this is some
sort of a plan by Satan.

332
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,160
It's a lot of, it's very
biblical. It's really interesting.

333
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:41,350
A lot of the flat earth
stop is very biblical.

334
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,230
That's it has to do with the firmament.

335
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,620
And they use descriptions and
depictions from the Bible. Oh yeah.

336
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,330
It's super bizarre.

337
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,280
And what's really bizarre is when you
listened to the youtube videos or these

338
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:58,840
discussions that are done by people
that use words that are real,

339
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,680
they string them together correctly.
They have like full sentences,

340
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:06,070
they appear to be articulate.
It's very confusing if you're a dummy,

341
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,420
if you listen to those ego like wow, this
guy's making a lot of sense. He's not.

342
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,620
But it sounds like he's making a lot of
sense cause he's using all these words

343
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:18,430
that are correctly,
users know oms he saying it articulately.

344
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,290
There's like everything seems like
like, oh my God, this man is exposing.

345
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,910
He's exposing the reality. But it's
not. It's just fucking nonsense.

346
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,830
And if you don't know any better,
and that's all you listened to,

347
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,890
that's where your head will go.
The same with the Anti Vaccine Movement.

348
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,880
If you only listened to
these anti-vaxxers, they're
making so much sense like,

349
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:40,420
oh my God, it's giving everybody
uh, all sorts of ailments.

350
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,310
And they have a theory of how it does
that, which is not, it's uses as you say,

351
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,950
scientific words,
but it's actually not correct.

352
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,620
Do you know it does this, which then
does that, which then does that,

353
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,590
they lay out a kind of causal chain,
which is false.

354
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,250
And then there's a problem of nuance
in perspective because there's so many

355
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,540
people that get vaccinated.

356
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,340
There's hundreds of millions
of people in this country,

357
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,270
billions of people worldwide.
And then there are instances,

358
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:09,160
rare occurrences where people have
real issues with vaccinations.

359
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,190
Well, there are some where they
have real issues. So for example,

360
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:16,060
there's some vaccines which are known to
cause certain neurological conditions,

361
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,990
rarely went out of a million or
one out of 100,000 vaccinations.

362
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,130
More commonly is a situation in which
you have vaccination is so common.

363
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:28,210
Everyone is getting vaccinated and often
that occurs near to an occurrence of

364
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:31,780
some other rare condition. And people
associate the two they think, oh,

365
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,130
because of the vaccine, this happened.
No, it's a coincidence either or. Yes,

366
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:38,680
there's both in the, and
there's also, you know,

367
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,310
if it's one out of a million and
you have 300 million, exactly.

368
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,880
You have 3 million.

369
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,690
1 million people with an
issue is a big deal. Yeah.

370
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,580
With 300 million people. Yes. You,

371
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,590
you easily could have
300 really big cases,

372
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,320
you know,

373
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,790
300 cases where if something died from
vaccines and then you bring those in

374
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,430
front of people and say, Oh my God.
And then there's this one and this one,

375
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:06,970
this one, and there's 298 more.
And you're like, Holy Shit,

376
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,940
all these people are dying from vaccines.
As you know,

377
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:12,520
it doesn't feel good if it's your child,

378
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:16,630
but when we look at the
greater perspective of humanity
and you say, well listen,

379
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,140
you don't want to bring back smallpox.
You don't want your child to get measles.

380
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,990
Babies can get measles when they
can't even be vaccinated for it.

381
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,170
This is one of the reasons why we need
to vaccinate children is to make sure

382
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:30,700
they don't get measles is a serious
fucking problem and a serious problem that

383
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:35,590
scientists have labored for untold
decades to try to try off of our

384
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:38,680
civilization. That we can
actually stop these diseases. Yes.

385
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:42,580
And save children's lives.
I had a woman yesterday who is an expert.

386
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,000
She's a medical historian and
expert in Victorian era surgery. Uh,

387
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,680
Lindsey Fitzharris and she wrote this
great book called the butchering art and

388
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:53,140
in it there's all these images.
Should she, one of them,

389
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:57,390
she brought up of what smallpox
actually looks like when people get it,

390
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,320
it's horrible. It just
covers people's bodies. Yes,

391
00:23:00,321 --> 00:23:03,520
you've eradicated this like
painful and you die from it.

392
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,770
It's actually gone.
Yes.

393
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,910
We don't get it into in this country
as funny where credible, it's credible.

394
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,400
But that's obviously neither here
nor there. So this book a blueprint,

395
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:19,690
the evolutionary origins of a good
society. When did you start this?

396
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,550
About nine or 10 years ago. Uh, and I,

397
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,710
at the time in my lab we were
doing research on friendship.

398
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,570
We were doing research on, on why people
have friends. It's actually, it's not,

399
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,500
it's not difficult to provide an account
for why we have sex with each other. Uh,

400
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,770
many animals, most animals are,
well, I don't know if it's most,

401
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:43,450
but animals either reproduce sexually
or asexually and most animals,

402
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:46,370
I'm trying to remember now what the
relative proportions anyway, mama

403
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,440
say most,
most animals reproduce sexually.

404
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,740
And it's not hard to provide
an account for how, um,

405
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,350
for why we, why sex originated,
why we reproduce sexually.

406
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,240
It's not hard to provide an account for.

407
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:04,241
Why we are choosy in our mates are why
we are careful in who we have sex with.

408
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,720
But human beings don't just mate with
each other. We befriend each other.

409
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,930
We form longterm non reproductive unions
to other individuals to whom we're not

410
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:18,200
related. Why that's very
rare in the animal kingdom.

411
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:22,790
Very few creatures do this. We do it.
Certain other primates, elephants,

412
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,580
certain whales and that's mostly it.

413
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,830
So the question is why.

414
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:30,920
So I became very interested in my lab
and trying to understand the deep origins

415
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:34,670
of friendship. Why would natural selection
have equipped us with his capacity?

416
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,240
And that set the stage then for an
exploring all kinds of other things in our

417
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:41,840
lives, like why we love each other.
For example, why do we, why do we,

418
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,890
when we have a sex with a person,
we tend to become attached to them.

419
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:48,320
We develop emotional sentiment about them.

420
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,950
That's not an essential to having sex yet.
We do that.

421
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,760
And then I became interested in other
kinds of good things like not into just

422
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:59,120
love and friendship,
but cooperation and teaching.

423
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,740
Teaching is another crazy thing.

424
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,630
We take it for granted that we teach
each other. But think about this.

425
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,640
Most animals are able to learn.

426
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,440
So a little fish in the ocean learns
that if it swims to the light,

427
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:17,000
it finds more food there. So the fish
then learns to, to, to be tropic,

428
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,750
to move towards the light. Uh,
and that's individual learning.

429
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,800
Some animals, uh, developed
what's called social learning.

430
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,820
Social learning is really efficient.
So if I put my hand in the fire,

431
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:32,510
I learned that I burned myself. I pull
my hand out, I've learned something,

432
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,130
I paid a price and I learned something.

433
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,530
I could observe you putting your hand
in the fire. You pay all the price.

434
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,770
But I gained most of the knowledge. It's
almost as good. I learned, oh people,

435
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:45,200
you shouldn't put your hand in the fire
saw that Joe put his hand in the fire.

436
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,980
So social learning is super
efficient learning from others,

437
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,290
but we take it to an even further level.

438
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,720
We don't just passively observe other EH,

439
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,980
other animals of our own species and
learn from them. We teach each other.

440
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,320
That is very rare in the animal kingdom
where one animal sets out to teach and

441
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:06,720
other animal something. So
the book is a, is, is, uh,

442
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,190
is about the evolutionary
origins of a good society.

443
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,640
It's also a kind of a response to kind
of push back to a long tradition in the

444
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:21,970
sciences of attention to the bad
parts of our nature. You know, uh,

445
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,580
scientists in my view have for too
long been looking at the origins of,

446
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,630
of murder and tribalism and
selfishness and mendacity.

447
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,170
Um,
but,

448
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,340
but I think the bright side
has been denied the attention
it deserves because we

449
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:41,780
have also evolved to love and to befriend
each other and to be kind to each

450
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:44,820
other and to cooperate and to teach
each other and all these good things.

451
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:48,750
And I'll shut up and
please don't know. And, uh,

452
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,480
and here's the thing. Here's the
sort of one way to think about this.

453
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,960
This must have been the case that the
benefits of a connected life outweighed

454
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:02,130
the costs.
We would not be living socially.

455
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,950
If my exposure to you
harmed me and Annette.

456
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,090
Other words, if I came near
you and you were violent to me,

457
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:14,760
you killed me or you
gave me misinformation,

458
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:18,960
you told me lies about the world than my
connection to you would ultimately harm

459
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:21,480
me, that I should be better off
living as an isolated animal.

460
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,660
So animals that come together
to live socially there,

461
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,360
the benefits of that
must outweigh the costs.

462
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,880
My living us living as a group.

463
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,720
So all this attention to the ways
in which our interactions are bad,

464
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,470
that we kill each other, that
we steal from each other,
that we lie to each other,

465
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,940
that we have tribalism and all of these
traits which we do every century is

466
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:46,470
replete with horrors. I'm not like
Pangloss like I don't think like,

467
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,350
you know, Pollyanna like, oh,
everything's great. That's not me.

468
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,890
But what is me is a kind of optimistic
focus on the good parts of our,

469
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,290
of human nature and the recognition
that those good parts must in toto

470
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,070
overwhelmed the bad parts.
While they certainly have to,

471
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:09,360
there's so many human beings. I mean
it's obvious that this is working. Yes,

472
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,250
we have propagated where everywhere
on every single patch of land that's

473
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,880
occupiable. In fact, you're,
you're exactly right. The argument,

474
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,080
and that's discussed in the book,

475
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,070
the way we have achieved the kind
of social conquest of the earth,

476
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,270
the way our species is,
is as spread out to occupy every niche,

477
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:31,110
which is also very rare. Most animals
live in one, you know, grizzlies live in,

478
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,070
in this part of the world. They don't
live in Amazonia. And, uh, you know,

479
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:38,980
polar bears live in this part of the
world. They don't live in, in Arizona,

480
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,860
et Cetera. So, so, uh, but
our species lives everywhere.

481
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,760
And the way we have come to be able
to do that is by the capacity to have

482
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:51,330
culture, to teach and learn from
each other, to accumulate knowledge.

483
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,030
So in the book I talk about lots of this,

484
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:58,860
a famous set of stories called the
last European explorer files about how

485
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,080
European explorers are lost. They lose
their supplies, they wind up dying.

486
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,220
And um,

487
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,860
but they're in an environment in which
other people thrive and survive because

488
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:12,600
they have learned to how to live there.

489
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,330
So we've spread out around
the world and then don't,

490
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,550
there's a chapter in the book at
the beginning about shipwrecks. So,

491
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,720
so I have this, should I go on
chaplain? Yeah, I have this,

492
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,290
I have this. Uh, so, so
what I'd like to do is,

493
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,870
what I tried to set out to do in the
beginning of the book is I say, look,

494
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,000
it's clear that our genes shaped the
structure and function of our bodies.

495
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,710
It is increasingly clear that our genes
also straight shape the and function of

496
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:45,420
our minds, our behaviors,
whether you are risk averse, uh,

497
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,360
how intelligent you are. Uh, uh,
whether you, uh, have wanderlust, uh,

498
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,500
these properties are properties
that depend in part on your genes.

499
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,370
But it's also clear to me,
and that's what the book argues,

500
00:29:57,371 --> 00:30:00,220
is that our genes shape not just the
structure and function of our bodies,

501
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,350
not just the structure
and function of our minds,

502
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,840
but also the structure and
function of our societies.

503
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,970
And to really prove that what we would
need is something known as the forbidden

504
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:10,804
experiment.

505
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,980
And the forbidden experiment
is an experiment in which
we took a group of babies

506
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,980
who had never been taught anything,
who are a cultural,

507
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:22,981
had no culture and stranded them on an
island and left them on their own to see

508
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:25,650
what kind of society they would
make when they grew up. You know,

509
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,490
how would they organize
themselves socially?

510
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,590
Is there kind of an innate society that
human beings are prewired to make in an

511
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:35,860
essence? Now, obviously
that's unethical and cruel,

512
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,230
but actually monarchs for thousands of
years of contemplated this experiment.

513
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,940
So Heraclitus writes in about how one of
the ancient Egyptian Pharaohs wanted to

514
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:47,410
know what kind of language would,

515
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,040
what was a natural language we had in
us that we would speak if we were not

516
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,990
taught language.
So this pharaoh,

517
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:57,991
it is said took two babies and gave them
to a mute Shepard Terez to see how did

518
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,370
the children's speak when they
grew up and uh, and, and, and uh,

519
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:04,420
the emperor Akbar attempted this,

520
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,640
there was a couple of European
kings at attempted this.

521
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,950
Obviously we can't actually do this.

522
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:13,450
So what I do in the book is I look at a
series of other approximations of that.

523
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:16,900
And one chapter is devoted to looking
at shipwrecks groups of men typically,

524
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:21,040
but sometimes men and women who,
between 1500 and 1900,

525
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,930
there were 9,000 shipwrecks, many more
thousands of ships were lost at sea.

526
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,640
And in 20 of those cases we
found 20 cases where, uh,

527
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,590
at least 19 people were stranded for
at least two months. And, uh, you know,

528
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:39,700
here's the, there's a kind of, um, here's
a map of the, uh, I'm going to, well,

529
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,500
here's one crew I can tell you about, but
here's a map of the, of the shipwrecks.

530
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,130
Like these are the,
Oh wow.

531
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,820
The all over the world
where they occurred and, uh,

532
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,320
when they occurred and how many people
there were. And uh, and so then I, uh,

533
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:56,170
I got all the original
accounts from the sailors,

534
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,380
from the people on the wrecks and all
contemporary archeological excavations of

535
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:04,900
those wrecks were where they
had been excavated. And, um,

536
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,520
and try to understand what kind of
society did these isolated cruise actually

537
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:12,360
wind up making. And there was some
amazing stories that were, uh,

538
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,680
that I found in there.
So the stayed for at least two months.

539
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:21,460
How many of them actually
established a real civilization?
How many, well, forever,

540
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,690
no, no one was stuck forever. Uh, most
of those crews were eventually, in fact,

541
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:28,900
all of those crews had at least one
survivor because if they had all died,

542
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,120
then I wouldn't be able
to know about them.

543
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,560
But there's a one famous case
in which these sailors, uh,

544
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,530
were stranded in near Australia,
I think somewhere in the Pacific.

545
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,530
And they managed to catch a big petrol,
one of those huge birds that, you know,

546
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,830
like a condor. And uh, and they, they,

547
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,420
they put a little note in a little tiny
bottle and they tied it to its feet.

548
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,670
And this petro flew thousands of miles
and landed in Australia and was found

549
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,600
with a note indicating where
the ice stranded sailors were.

550
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,950
And a ship was sent to go find
the men and the got there,

551
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:08,630
but they had all died. They were all gone.
So they use this, this, uh, this bird.

552
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,470
So the bird, well, no, they didn't
eat the bird. They push. No.

553
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,710
I think if you had that choice,
you would communicate rather than eat Joe.

554
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:21,320
I think. Yes. Yeah. For a little bit.

555
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,570
Well until the very end as yes, yes. But,
uh, they starved to death. We don't know.

556
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,720
Nobody knows.
But the point is that we have to,

557
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,140
for me to be able to describe what
happened, we needed at least one survivor.

558
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,410
Often. There were many cases
where everyone survived. I mean,

559
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:41,411
there was one pair of cases that I was
amazing to me in 1846 in south Auckland

560
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:49,100
islands, just north of Antarctica,
south of New Zealand. Uh, the, uh,

561
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:51,680
the Grafton was racked on the
southern part of the island.

562
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,970
I can't remember how big the island was.

563
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,100
It's in the book and maybe let's say 90
miles long or something or 20 miles long

564
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:01,520
thing. It's 20 miles long on the
southern part of the island. Uh,

565
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,660
five men are wrecked on the Grafton and,
uh,

566
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,870
on the northern part of the island,
the Invico rex,

567
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,340
19 men are wrecked on the INVICO.
Uh,

568
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,290
all the graft and cruise survives the,
and both feet.

569
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,230
Both crews were on the
island at the same time.

570
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,480
They never encountered each other. They're
struggling for survival. It's like an,

571
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,900
like an experiment. Like who's going to
win? Tempted to say fear factor. Yeah.

572
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,670
And uh, and, and the question is who's
going to survive and how and why.

573
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,830
Everyone in the graft and crew survives,
and 16 of the 19 men on the, uh,

574
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,670
on the INVICO crew die. And there's also
cannibalism in that crew. So it's a,

575
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:45,170
it's a very, it's a very different
outcome for various reasons.

576
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,400
So anyway,

577
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:51,170
so the point is that in the book I
start with a series of stories about how

578
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:54,690
people come together to make,

579
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,390
attempt to make new civilizations.

580
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,740
I use the example of
unintentional communities with,
uh, with shipwrecks. I have,

581
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,420
I looked at it, intentional communities
like communes and um, and uh,

582
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,250
kibbutzes in Israel and a 1970s
communes in the United States,

583
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:15,200
a 19th century communes in
the United States. Actually
going back to Roman times,

584
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:18,350
there've always been groups of people
who've said, society's fucked up.

585
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,930
I'm going to go. And we're going
to make it again. You know,

586
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,910
we're going to start a fresh.
Um,

587
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,500
I look at settlements in Antarctica
of scientists. I look at the Pitcairn,

588
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,280
you know, the mutiny on the bounty. I
look at the Shackleton expedition. Many,

589
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:33,620
many cases of stranded,

590
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:36,590
isolated groups of people trying
to make a new social order.

591
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,160
And then I also use data from
experiments we do in my lab.

592
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:45,180
We have this software where tens of
thousands of people have come and played

593
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,150
these games.
We,

594
00:35:46,151 --> 00:35:51,151
we can create these temporary artificial
societies of real people where people

595
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:54,720
come and spend an hour or two and we
would as God like wake an engineer,

596
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:55,441
the society,

597
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:59,880
we can have a lot of inequality or little
inequality or various other features.

598
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:03,570
And then we can observe what happens.
And I look at all of that data,

599
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:06,510
all those stories and say,
look,

600
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,930
there is a deep and fundamental way
that no matter what human beings,

601
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,520
uh, make a society their underlying
fundamental principles about society,

602
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,620
which are as innate as the fact
that you have two kidneys. You know,

603
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,520
most people, almost everyone
or your pancreas makes insulin.

604
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,530
But they're very different all
throughout the world. Right?

605
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,030
I mean there's totalitarian
society, no nose, no.

606
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:38,580
So here's the point. No, yes. So
here's what, here's the argument.

607
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,280
You look around the world and the
way the example I give is that yes,

608
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,830
there's huge cultural variation
around the world. Just like you said,

609
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:47,820
to tell turn societies.

610
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:51,150
There's people have different foods and
they have different ways of dressing and

611
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:54,990
there's enormous cultural variation
and it's marvelous and interesting and

612
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:59,640
obvious to anybody. But I think we're
missing the forest from the trees. To me,

613
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:04,620
this is like you and I are sitting on a
plane and we look at a hill that's 300

614
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:08,070
feet and 900 feet and we say
those are very different hills.

615
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,240
But actually if he took a step back,
we would see that we're on,

616
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,160
we were on a plateau and
one was a mountain that was
10,300 feet and another was

617
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:20,170
a mountain that was 10,900 feet.
And actually there,

618
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,220
there are these much more deep and
fundamental plate tectonic forces that are

619
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:27,720
creating these two mountains
that are very similar.

620
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,780
But we are just focused
on the superficial top.

621
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,750
So the argument in the book is
that everywhere in the world,

622
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,010
people have friendship. People love
their partners, people cooperate,

623
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,360
people teach each other.

624
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,390
These are fundamental common
principals shared by everyone.

625
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,410
Even though there's also a
lot of variation, even in
a place like North Korea.

626
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,020
Yes. Now North Korea, that that state,

627
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:55,730
so totalitarian states apply huge
cultural pressure to suppress this innate

628
00:37:56,281 --> 00:38:00,000
tendency. It's like,
it's like a religious,

629
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,920
you need a lot of belief in God to
suppress your innate desire to have sex.

630
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,880
Right? Right. So you can have a
belief system that's very powerful,

631
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,160
that kind of prevents you,

632
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,250
squashes what would otherwise be a kind
of in escapable inclination you have.

633
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,460
So totalitarian regimes,
and this is discussed in the book too,

634
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,690
they are very threatened
by the institution of the
family. They're threatened.

635
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:29,250
You need to owe your loyalty to the state,
not to your family,

636
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,690
not to your friends. And so they have a
series of institutions that, you know,

637
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:38,620
everyone has comrade, everyone
called Conrad for example, or, or,

638
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,130
uh, uh, there are a lot of, a lot of
times, well I won't, I don't want to,

639
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:43,990
I don't know if I want to speak
at the state level. Let me,

640
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:48,280
let me take it down a notch to communes.
So if you think about communes,

641
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,850
if you're going to make a commune of
people and you want them to feel real

642
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,620
loyalty to the commune,

643
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,600
one way you can do that is you want to,
uh,

644
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,270
reduce the commitment people have
to their partners, let's say their,

645
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:06,760
their mates in, in order to do that,
you can go to one of two extremes.

646
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,930
Either you can prohibit sex, like
the shakers and you say, okay,

647
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,110
no one is going to have sex with anyone
because we're all in a commune and we

648
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:16,810
all love each other and we're not going
to have a special love for particular

649
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:17,644
people.

650
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,580
Or You could go to the other extreme and
you can have polyamory say everyone's

651
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:23,830
going to have sex with everyone else.
Once again,

652
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:27,700
you see that subverts the special
relationship that people might form with

653
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:31,300
particular individuals.
And so both of those strategies,

654
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:34,690
even though they're opposite,
are attempting to do the same thing,

655
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:37,330
which is to break down real relationships,
face to face,

656
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:40,450
relationship between individuals so
that you can have a commitment to this

657
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:45,040
higher group. And that's what totalitarian
states also face the same dilemma.

658
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,840
And that's also why,
incidentally,

659
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:51,790
a lot of the states try to re reduce
gender differences, right? They like,

660
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:55,260
you know, the Mao jacket, the men and
women all were wearing the similar,

661
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,790
similar kind of attire for instance.
Uh,

662
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:02,791
because they want to have people see
themselves as interchangeable and not as

663
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:06,130
individuals and relationships,
not be particular.

664
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,240
Did you study cults a little bit?
Um,

665
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,100
not a lot. Uh, there's some talk a
little bit in the book about cults,

666
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:18,430
but I don't really need to get to cults
in order to make the arguments that I'm

667
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,110
making. No, I mean not even just

668
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,080
to make arguments,

669
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:26,081
just to compare because
that is essentially like in
particularly the Rajneesh

670
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,070
called Oregon, the wild, wild west
or wild wild country documentary.

671
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:33,320
On Netflix. Did you see that?
No, I haven't. It's fantastic.

672
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,770
They essentially took over an entire town
and started busing and homeless people

673
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:40,154
to vote.

674
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,290
Oh, I read about that.
I know about this. Yes.

675
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,440
It's really quite amazing.
And what they did was really weird.

676
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:50,120
You know what I mean? For there's moments
in the documentary you're like, wow,

677
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,380
maybe they're on to something,

678
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,920
and then of course it goes completely
sideways and they wind up poisoning people

679
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:55,940
and it's chaos.

680
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,450
But I am absolutely fascinated by those
types of environments where people do

681
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:05,990
decide they're going to branch
off from regular. They don't,

682
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,180
they're unsatisfied with
regular civilization.

683
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,580
They're gonna all move to some location.

684
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,610
Yes. That's a, that's a primitive and
ancient impulse. Like I was saying,

685
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:16,680
people have been doing that
for since time and memorial.

686
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,790
It's how America got started.
Yes, yes, yes. It's, screw this.

687
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:24,810
I'm going over there to start again. But
again and again, when people do that,

688
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:27,890
they keep expressing some of these
fundamental beliefs. It's, yes, yes.

689
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,260
It's like saying yes. Anyway,
go on. No, please. No, no, no.

690
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:34,190
I don't have anything to add. I
mean, I just was what you said,

691
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,670
but yes, that's right. I mean, I'm,

692
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm always fascinated by people that
are unhappy with the current state of

693
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:43,310
affairs. They don't like the
way society feels to them.

694
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:46,730
They don't feel like they belong and
they want to try somewhere else. I mean,

695
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,270
and what was really interesting to me
is the last time someone did this as a

696
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:54,920
country, as far as I know,
is the United States. There
really is. It's about, I mean,

697
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,210
it's also very unique that this is one
of the weirdest countries in the world in

698
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:04,040
terms of our ability to freely
express ourselves and more guns.

699
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,810
Well, the thing about America, that's it,

700
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:08,690
it's like the American
experiment would have,

701
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,570
is about the fact that
anyone can be an American.

702
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:17,360
My parents immigrated from Greece. Uh,
I was raised in this country, you know,

703
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,560
uh,
I,

704
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,220
to be an American means to buy into a
certain set of principles like the bill of

705
00:42:22,221 --> 00:42:26,360
rights and many other countries
are very xenophobic. You know, you,

706
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,690
you can't become a Japanese.
It's, you can't be,

707
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,500
you can't be nationalized in Japan.
I mean you can,

708
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:35,300
but it's extremely difficult and rare.
Uh, so it's a very homogeneous country.

709
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:37,610
Switzerland is another country.
It's very difficult to become Swiss.

710
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:39,860
You can't be nationalized
as a Swiss. I mean, you can,

711
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:44,420
but it's extremely difficult and rare. So,
um, but the United States, you know, we,

712
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,740
we say you are an American. If you from
all of the whole world, you're welcome.

713
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:53,070
Bring us your tired. Your, you know, the
famous saying on the foot on the, your,

714
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,340
I forgot the saying,
it's very poetic on the bottom of the,

715
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,650
of the Statue of Liberty. You're
wretched. You're, you're for Lauren,

716
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:03,380
whatever it is. Uh, and
you can come to this,

717
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:06,950
these shores and make
your life a new. And, um,

718
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,340
and all you need to do to
be an American is to, um,

719
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,570
buy into a commitment to constitutional
governance, democratic rule,

720
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,980
Bill of rights and these principles.

721
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:20,720
Now we should note that there were
millions of people that were brought as

722
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:22,910
slaves and voluntarily to these shores.

723
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,420
We don't always realize our best virtues.

724
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,400
We allow people to come,

725
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:31,820
but like the Irish and treat them as
second class citizens or the Italians or

726
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:35,840
the Greeks even. Um, you know,
we, we don't always do that, but,

727
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,840
but the idea that you're putting on
the table, which I think is correct,

728
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:43,340
is that you can be an American. This
is a special, unusual experiment.

729
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,250
You can't reinvent yourself
quite that way. And to my
knowledge, in any other, uh,

730
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,350
colony or country,

731
00:43:49,351 --> 00:43:53,240
that's why it's one of the weirdest
things that this is a country where

732
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:58,130
anti-immigrant sentiments
are running rampant. Yes.
One of the entire foundation,

733
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:01,760
the country is based on immigration.
Yes. The only way people got here,

734
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:04,760
if you're not a native American,
it was taken from the native Americans.

735
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:07,610
And everyone's since then is an immigrant
or a descendant of an immigrant.

736
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:12,520
That's correct. In the native Americans,
they came 20,000. Yes. It's crazy.

737
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,200
Yes. The whole thing's
crazy. Yes. It's, it's just,

738
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,340
and it's such a unique environment
for expression. I mean,

739
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:23,960
there's really no other country
that has as free expression.

740
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,500
Even the Brits don't. That's right.
And Canada certainly does. Correct.

741
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,010
And they're our neighbors.
Yes, it's uh, it's just, it's a

742
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,360
very unusual thing.

743
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:37,680
And this unusual thing is the most
recent incarnation of a country.

744
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,370
Yes, yes. I think that's right.
And I think there are, you know,

745
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:44,460
then this ties in with a whole set of
ideas about American exceptionalism.

746
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:47,570
You know, are we, how
different are we, uh,

747
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,190
what is the source of our wealth?

748
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:54,390
What is the height of our
civilization? You know, I'm, I'm,

749
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,650
I am distressed by some of the direction
our country is going in at the moment,

750
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,180
but I think the, you know, I
think in the long arc of history,

751
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:07,920
I think the United States stands for
many of the best principals in the world.

752
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,700
And I'm prepared to defend
those principles. I am too.

753
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:15,660
And I think what you were saying with
your libertarian friend and you know,

754
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,060
someone who may be an anarchist
or whatever, and then there's,

755
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,540
there's room for all these weird opinions.

756
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,780
They might not be correct and they will
all be represented is just gigantic soup

757
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:29,550
of human beings.
It's 300 plus million.

758
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:35,220
It's just the idea that America is like
a white nationalists in Charlottesville.

759
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:41,550
This is what's wrong with America. No,
what's wrong with America is volume.

760
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:42,490
You know,
you're,

761
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:47,490
you're going to have certain ridiculous
ideas and awful ideas that are amplified

762
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:52,620
in this volume is incredible.
Massive humans. Yes. I think a large,

763
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:56,690
I think that's right. I think
our size, uh, contributes to, uh,

764
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:01,080
or makes a kind of heterogeneity
of ideas more easy. Uh, you know,

765
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:04,170
if we were tiny country, although
even in small democracies, you know,

766
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:07,890
like you go to European countries
that are tiny, uh, Spain for example.

767
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,890
I mean it's not tiny, but it's
tiny compared to us. Uh, you know,

768
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:14,910
there's a lot of difference of beliefs
from far left to far. Right. But I think,

769
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,490
I think the key aspect, which you're
talking about earlier, which again,

770
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:18,900
you're highlighting,
which I agree with,

771
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,730
is that we want an environment in which
people can, the ground rules are clear.

772
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:27,660
So, you know, you can't, there's no
physical contact allowed. Right. So we do,

773
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,230
we draw a bright line distinction
between words and deeds.

774
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,630
So I completely reject the idea that
words are violent. Violent. Yeah, totally.

775
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:40,200
Yeah. I totally reject that. Uh, and, and
because we have different words for it,

776
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:44,100
the two different things,
totally different. I mean,
we, we, so ground was our,

777
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:47,670
you know, I can't touch
you, but I can speak, uh,

778
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,610
other ground rules are that we
are committed to open expression.

779
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,870
A good ground rule would be that we grant
positive intent. We grant good intent.

780
00:46:54,871 --> 00:46:57,720
That is to say, I tried to put what
you're saying in the most favorable light.

781
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,900
First I think about it. I say, okay,
now wait a minute. What is he saying?

782
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,650
What does he mean by that? He,
Mike's, uh, now you may be an idiot.

783
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:07,590
A person may be an idiot. They
may be viral, they may be violent,

784
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,350
they may be wrong. You know, all
of those things are also possible,

785
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:14,730
but that's not the first Goto. Um, so
anyway, if we set those ground rules,

786
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,690
I think, I believe strongly that
in the marketplace of ideas,

787
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,550
the truth will out, um, and,
and righteousness will out.
That's, that's what I think.

788
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,480
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe in fact, what
we need is a benevolent dictator who,

789
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:29,920
you know, comes down and
tells us what to think and do,

790
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:32,560
but that's not the world
I want to live in. Yeah.

791
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:35,620
The benevolent dictator idea
is what does that come from?

792
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,450
Like why is it just because it's,

793
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,890
that's really been the only way the
society is actually functioned for most of

794
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:46,660
the past. Fantasize, right. Every,
I mean Plato talks about this,

795
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:50,380
I mean people look around and they
think situation is not so great.

796
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,970
I really wished it was a strong man
that would come down and fix it. Um,

797
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:58,480
this is the inclination towards
Trump. I think in some part, yes,

798
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:02,770
Trumpism is a little bit about this
fantasy that, that we will, um,

799
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,540
you know, that that the way out is to
have a kind of imposition from above.

800
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,970
And I think that's very
dangerous actually.

801
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,660
And we were talking about earlier in
college campuses, it's the same principle,

802
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:13,901
right?

803
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:18,901
Like the idea that big daddy's going to
come down and tell us what to do and fix

804
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,180
the situation I think is
undemocratic in the end.

805
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,440
And painting it has to follow the
rules of these children. What I mean,

806
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:30,970
this is part of the issue with
the idea of words equal violence.

807
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:36,150
I mean this is not a well thought through
idea and this is an idea that is world

808
00:48:36,151 --> 00:48:39,280
rewards can lead to violence.
Sure. Words can be painful.

809
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,980
They can hurt your feelings. Yes, that
can be unpleasant. All of that is true,

810
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:48,580
but words are different than violence.
They just are. And so I think we need to,

811
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:53,440
you know, and in fact as John
Height and uh, and uh, uh,

812
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,420
Greg Louisiana argue,

813
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,590
we actually might want to create there
other reasons to draw the distinction

814
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:04,480
between words and violence and
to cultivate an appreciation
for that distinction.

815
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,120
And that is by allowing people to speak,

816
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:12,121
we may actually reduce violence because
we can identify who has these crazy

817
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:16,840
ideas. We know who. So if you're, if, if,

818
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:21,310
if I believe that someone hates people
like me and I created an environment in

819
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:24,460
which we allow him to say
he hates people like me,

820
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,950
I think it's horrible that
he hates people like me.

821
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,150
I'm not defending that he hates people
like me, but we might now know who he is,

822
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:36,190
right as I stay away from
him, you know? Uh, so,

823
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,630
so that's their argument that look,
you in height make that,

824
00:49:38,631 --> 00:49:42,160
that actually this is a
potentially additional
additional benefit of creating a

825
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:46,720
free and open marketplace of ideas is we
identify where the crazy is, you know,

826
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:48,520
here are all these people were
talking about the anti-vaxxers.

827
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:53,050
I'd like to know who are the people that
hold these beliefs because as a public

828
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:56,590
health expert,
and I was a hospice doctor for many years,

829
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:58,090
I took care of patients for a long time.
Anyway,

830
00:49:58,091 --> 00:50:01,120
I was very am still interested in a lot
of our projects around the world are

831
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:05,080
public health projects. In order to
be able to lead people to wisdom,

832
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:09,250
you have to know where, where's the
ignorance? Right? Well, if it's secret,

833
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:10,084
you don't know it.

834
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:15,610
So that's another benefit of fostering
this climate of open expression. Yeah.

835
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:16,110
And the,

836
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:21,110
the solution to these bad ideas is for
someone to come up and give a better

837
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:22,480
idea.
Yes.

838
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:27,580
Someone to debate or to expand what's
wrong with it and to do it in a reasonable

839
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,020
manner. When people start shouting
and screaming and pulling fire alarms,

840
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:34,730
like it's this side,

841
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,690
the idea of silencing people from speaking
that somehow know that this is going

842
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:42,690
to help. This is a, this is
also part of d platforming. Yes.

843
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:45,110
When people call for deep, deep
planning, I think that's wrong.

844
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,610
Even based on just a reasonable
people with differing opinions.

845
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,980
It's raw. It's crazy. There's a tach
will, Peter Tatchell, there's a, uh,

846
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,890
a gay rights activist in, um, in England
who went to prison for his rights, was,

847
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:02,820
had been imprisoned in foreign countries
for defending a gay rights and he was d

848
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:04,490
platformed in England
a couple of years ago.

849
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,610
Now here's the problem with d platforming.
So first of all,

850
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,880
it is totally right and
appropriate to protest.

851
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,690
So if someone is speaking something
you don't want, I will strongly defend,

852
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,550
protest, stand outside, yell
and scream, hold banners up,

853
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:20,150
whatever.

854
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,320
You can't interfere with the right of
the speaker to express themselves first

855
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:25,670
point.
But even more important.

856
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:30,440
The reason we don't want that is not
so much because we're interested in the

857
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:31,550
right of the speaker.

858
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,120
It's because we're interested
in the rights of the listeners,

859
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,740
the people who are want to listen to that
person have a right to listen to that

860
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:44,240
person in a free society.
So when we prevent them, the
harm were causing is not,

861
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,240
it's not that I'm silencing you,
I'm,

862
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,290
I am interfering with the ability of all
the people who want to hear you to hear

863
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:55,490
you. It's their rights that matter
too. So if we it the D platforming,

864
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,590
it's not about, oh, so and so was unable
to speak at such and such a place.

865
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,220
It's the fact that all the people that
want it to hear so and so we're deprived

866
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,790
of their opportunity to do so.
So I think the answer to words,

867
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,970
we do not like the answer to speech.
We do not like is more speech.

868
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,180
It's not silencing. Yeah.
And there's also the, uh,

869
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,100
the obvious situation. You put someone
in, when you do attempt to silence them,

870
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:22,630
you put them under duress and
their message changes you,

871
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:24,890
you make someone more combative.
And yes,

872
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,930
this has often been the argument for
why Trump became president in the first

873
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:34,640
place is that people were tired
of the argument on the other side.

874
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:35,721
I mean,

875
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:39,800
I'm not a political scientist and I
followed that literature a little bit. Uh,

876
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:42,710
I think there is a strong argument
that that is one of the factors that

877
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:46,280
contributed to Trump's a success.
Let's keep in mind however,

878
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:51,050
that the majority of Americans voted
for Hillary Clinton. Um, and, and,

879
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,470
uh, he's a majority of
Americans didn't vote correct,

880
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,430
but of the people who voted yes, that's
right. That's another whole problem. Um,

881
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,030
but 63 or so million, uh, I, anyway,

882
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:04,550
about 3 million more people voted for
Hillary Clinton than voted for Donald

883
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:08,750
Trump nationally. So, um, so,
uh, I forgot how we got onto him.

884
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:13,790
What were you saying? When we're talking
about people wanting to silence people?

885
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:14,843
So one of the things,

886
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,860
correctness and the rebounding of that
is that reinforcing of someone who comes

887
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:23,480
along who's the polar opposite of
that? Yes, I would agree with that.

888
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,170
And I think that that's another,
you know,

889
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:28,140
that sort of is a variant of the
argument we were discussing earlier,

890
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:29,580
which is that you,

891
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,120
one of the advantages of creating a
free and open society is that you allow,

892
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:37,700
you know, live and let live
and uh, then you don't, you
don't, you, you tend to, um,

893
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,250
you avoid creating kind of
suppressed animosities or you,

894
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:46,370
you can help to avoid it to open
communication is so critical and it's also

895
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,850
critical to have reasonable,
polite conversation.

896
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,200
Like people can oppose each
other info in their idea,

897
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,440
but you should be able to express how
and why you oppose that idea without it

898
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:06,000
being this sort of personal yes.
Vendetta. Yes, I agree with that. I mean,

899
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:09,570
you know, I think we have to accept that
there will be, people will get angry.

900
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,900
I mean that's part of having
an open society and I think
we need to get a person.

901
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,110
Yes. And I think we need to accept
that some people, not everyone will,

902
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,120
will engage in discourse the way you
and I might want to engage in that

903
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:22,650
discourse.
Um,

904
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,730
but I do agree with you completely
that ideally we would have a kind of

905
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:31,500
civilized conversation that allowed
us to learn, um, and to grow.

906
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,600
And I think ultimately that
as we've been saying is,

907
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:36,060
is better for our society as well.
Well,

908
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:40,530
I think we should acknowledge
that people are going to be upset,

909
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,820
but we should also applaud people for
not being upset. I think there's a,

910
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,990
there's a higher value to people being
able to communicate reasonably. Yes,

911
00:54:48,991 --> 00:54:49,440
I agree.

912
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,250
I don't think that that's
reinforced enough and I don't
think that's appreciated

913
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,320
enough.
I can play up high.

914
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:58,470
Don't you want to get any disagreement
from me on that? Yes. Yeah. I mean I just,

915
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:02,390
I just think we, this is
something that we can do. Yes.

916
00:55:02,391 --> 00:55:06,270
And we can get better at it. Well, I
think it's like martial arts training,

917
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:10,580
you know, I think that it
is self discipline is not
an easy thing Joe. And, um,

918
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,050
like anything else worth doing in life,

919
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:15,150
like basically anything
worth doing takes effort.

920
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,530
It's tempting the Goto
strategy that many people have.

921
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:23,370
So I think it's important to note that
free speech is difficult and is not an

922
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:27,330
easy thing. It's a natural inclination
to want to silence your opponents,

923
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:32,940
but it's wrong it and it's harmful and
it's actually harmful to you to do that.

924
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,820
So, um, so,

925
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,970
so I think we need to have an
educational system that cultivates,

926
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:40,020
cultivates that,

927
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:45,050
that cultivates the capacity to tolerate
an idea that you don't like to think

928
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:50,860
about that idea and then to
respond to that idea. Um, so, so,

929
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:54,120
but I, so, so I guess what
I'm saying, it's, it's a, it
does require some training.

930
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:57,810
It doesn't come naturally, unfortunately,
you know, but it should be reinforced.

931
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:58,683
Yes.

932
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,070
I think there's a way to do that and
there's a way to appreciate that and as a

933
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:04,770
way to call that out
when you see it and just,

934
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,170
I think the world needs more of it.
And if we can figure out a way to do that,

935
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:14,820
we will find that we are differences
are not nearly as egregious.

936
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:17,370
They're the not nearly as disgusting
as well, like to think that, well,

937
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:20,370
that's exactly what I argue
with blueprint, that there's
such, you know, like,

938
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:20,641
you know,

939
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:23,710
when you go to a foreign country initially
you're overwhelmed by the different

940
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:24,100
food

941
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,370
and the different smells and the
different architecture and anyone who's

942
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:31,960
traveled even to a different state has
had this experience. And yet actually,

943
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:35,140
once you get to know the people, you see
that they're very human. They're like us,

944
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:38,470
they love their partners and they hang
out with their friends and they work

945
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:41,650
together to build a
civilization and a society.

946
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:44,710
And they have schools and they teach
and they learn and they do all of these

947
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:48,670
basic things that are a fundamental
part of our common humanity. And,

948
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:53,320
and this is what I talk about in blueprint
at length. You know, like I, I, uh,

949
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:57,700
you know, I just, I think it's,
I think there's a kind of, um,

950
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:02,120
there's a kind of flawed
beauty to the world that, ah,

951
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:07,090
captivates me and it's a little bit on
the, there's a synthetic tradition in, in,

952
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:11,380
in Japan and a philosophy called Wabi.
Sabi. Do you know Wabi Sabi? Sabi is, no,

953
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:15,670
probably know about it, but you may not
know the word, so I've heard it, you know,

954
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:16,210
like how,

955
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,660
like the western aesthetic for pottery
is like these perfectly symmetrical,

956
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:21,670
beautifully glazed, you know, pots.

957
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,990
But there's a tradition in Japan of
slightly imperfect pots, you know,

958
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:29,080
like a crackpot or a pot
that's slightly misshapen.

959
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:32,590
It's very difficult to masters to
make these pots. And it's, it's,

960
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,450
it's called Wabi Sabi and it's about,

961
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,870
it's about how imperfections are
kind of beauty of imperfection,

962
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:42,370
a kind of flawed beauty, um, like
a hot girl with a gap in her teeth.

963
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,720
Yes.
I suppose,

964
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:51,590
yes. I suppose that could be
an example of that, that, um,

965
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,960
or you know, Elle Macpherson,
you know, famously had that
little, uh, uh, was it her,

966
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:59,020
I forgot, which was the famous model
that had Sydney Crawford. Yeah.

967
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:04,120
I had that famous a mole on her face
and glassy. So it's a flawed beauty. So,

968
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
so here's the point.

969
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:09,370
It's not hard to look around the world
and see the violence and the murderer in

970
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:13,090
the warfare and the incompetent leadership
and all of these awful things about

971
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:14,110
our species,

972
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,310
but we're really a fucking
unbelievable species actually,

973
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:23,020
who do amazing things when you compare
us to other species and there's a kind of

974
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:26,620
flawed beauty to us and I think that it's,

975
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,550
it's wrong to be seduced to the dark side.
You know,

976
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,360
it's wrong to like only focus on those,
on the bad stuff.

977
00:58:34,361 --> 00:58:37,780
I also think it's a kind of moral
and philosophical laziness, right?

978
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,890
If we allow ourselves to just
think that, oh, you know,

979
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,330
people are awful.

980
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:47,290
It kind of relieves us of any
duty to be good and to work,

981
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:51,040
to make the world better. It's a kind
of, you know, surrender to the dark side.

982
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:56,060
I think that's wrong. And the book shows
exactly how and why that's wrong and,

983
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,340
and how we,

984
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,970
how natural selection has shaped all
these wonderful qualities which are shared

985
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,370
the world over.
So you go to the foreign country,

986
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,020
you're initially perplexed by their crazy
practices and then slowly but surely

987
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:11,200
you find our common humanity.
And I anyway,

988
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:15,370
I find that it's pleasing, at least
to me, that perspective, you know,

989
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:17,490
that's one of the cool things
about travel, right? You,

990
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,980
you broaden your perspective and your
understanding of what it means to be a

991
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,040
person.
Go to these

992
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,110
different environments and
yourself too. Yeah, yeah.

993
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:26,810
They're different and they're
different foods or different art.

994
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,860
They're different architecture. And you
go, oh, this is also possible to yes,

995
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,590
people can live like this.
Yes.

996
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,510
And do you even begin to see why
they live like that? You know,

997
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:39,140
like you initially you go to Greece
and you have resin flavored wine,

998
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:43,310
you have it at Siena and you wondering
why would these crazy Greeks put pine

999
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:45,920
resin in there ruining
perfectly good white wine.

1000
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,730
And then after awhile you start to say,
Hey, actually this is pretty good. Uh,

1001
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:51,470
you know,
this is not a crazy thing after all.

1002
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:54,860
And you acquired case run resident
and there were walls. Yes. You know,

1003
00:59:54,861 --> 00:59:59,780
the first time, the first time
I had scotch whiskey, I, I,

1004
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:03,290
uh, I didn't know what I thought about
it. And now I love whiskey. Right.

1005
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,440
It's an acquired taste. So the first
time you drink something like that,

1006
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:09,540
you think, you know, yes. They put resin,
they put pine resin in their white wine.

1007
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,270
They chill it.
I should've brought you some,

1008
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:14,510
maybe I'll send you on an acquired taste.
Ouzo Koolaid.

1009
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:19,320
It's delicious from the beginning.
Yeah. I just right out of the cold.

1010
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:22,790
And this is sweet. Good. Yes, yes, yes.

1011
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,690
We'll have to convince anybody.
Yes, that's right. That's right.

1012
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:27,890
Some things that's right.

1013
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:30,680
Some things are just good right
out of the budget is good. Yes.

1014
01:00:30,681 --> 01:00:33,920
Kool aid is just good. Yeah. I mean, I
don't recommend you drink it all the time.

1015
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:37,460
It's full of sugar. It's terrible for
you. But damn, that's tough. It's like,

1016
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,900
it's like a, it's like fried
foods, you know? Yeah, sure. Yummy.

1017
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,920
A lot of them French fries. Yes. I mean,
come on man, salt and catch up. You guys

1018
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,330
know I'm a, I'm not sure about
what I should mention, but anyway,

1019
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,320
I love Popeye's fried chicken. I do
as well. I love it so bad. It's awful.

1020
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:01,300
And my wife, my wife is unlikely to
listen to this full podcast so or I'll,

1021
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:05,660
I'll skip over this part so she doesn't
hear this part but and my sister will be

1022
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:08,780
listening probably and so she will
laugh when she gets to this part because

1023
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:13,490
whenever I see a Popeye's I just pull
over and indulge myself and then I

1024
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,680
terrible. Terrible. It's Hafez
is good. But you know what?

1025
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:21,700
If you really want to indulge and
you like chicken Roscoe's in La,

1026
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:26,180
I have it. No, you don't know. Oh, I
don't know. Ascos chicken and waffles.

1027
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,130
Oh Dude. I tried to go there and
get in waffle family. We tried.

1028
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:34,390
Don't you make that tried to go there
the other day with my family and a half.

1029
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:39,110
Wait on the same place on day chicken
and waffles course on the same plate.

1030
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,920
What are you a communist? Yeah,
man, it's La Tierra above them too.

1031
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:48,800
And butter. Yeah. You
mean the chewiness? Yes.

1032
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:53,120
It perfectly.
It's damn delicious in my mind.

1033
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:56,360
Yet from another pant I,
I make maple syrup.

1034
01:01:56,361 --> 01:02:00,000
I live in Vermont and I make Maple Syrup.
I tap my own trees and wow.

1035
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,010
What a freak. I have a,
I have a, yeah, exactly.

1036
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:05,820
Giving people a hard time for waffles
and chicken again. Show me the colonel.

1037
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:09,350
The colonel is a liar. He does
not have it. Get out of here.

1038
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:12,130
It's not even the colonel.
The colonel is norm Macdonald.

1039
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,030
Norman said temporary like promotion
or something. This is nonsense. Yeah,

1040
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,550
but they do, oh my gosh. I got a waffle.

1041
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,510
The syrup goes on top of the chicken that
chicken and waffles and chicken tastes

1042
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:30,170
like cat litter compared to Roscoe's.
Also sweet chick La.

1043
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,330
He could try to get this outta
here. Uh, so, uh, it's tough.

1044
01:02:34,331 --> 01:02:37,170
Can go fuck off Roscoe's
chicken and waffles.

1045
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,240
You get the Greens to the Collard
Greens. That's fine. Damn good.

1046
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:44,100
That's fine.
But that's a waste of maple syrup.

1047
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,190
Take it from the man who makes it to put
it on chicken. Chicken is good. I'm sure.

1048
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:51,180
Sweet. It's nozzles place. I get it. I
love it. I've been there. It's great.

1049
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,610
Roscoe's okay, I'll have a look. Fuck off.

1050
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,470
There's a reason why there's an hour
and a half wait on a Sunday. Okay.

1051
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,000
How long you in town for a just a day.
Maybe I'll be back though.

1052
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,490
I'll be back over there
right after the show.

1053
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:06,790
Maybe I'll go there for a
little one on Gower. Okay.
Ooh Man. It's good. All right.

1054
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,640
Maybe I'll try that. It's so good.
And it's also one of those places.

1055
01:03:09,641 --> 01:03:11,520
It's been there forever.
We used to get it.

1056
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:15,900
I found out about it from 19
1994 when I was doing news radio.

1057
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:20,460
95 ish, I guess. Have you been in La
since you left the Massachusetts? No,

1058
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:22,500
I went to New York for a couple
of years then I moved down here,

1059
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,940
moved down here in [inaudible] 94 okay,
so you've been here a long time. Yeah.

1060
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,690
And when I was on news radio,
they got it for like,

1061
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:31,620
you can order lunch and someone ordered
Roscoe's chicken and I was like,

1062
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:35,100
what is this like waffles? And it was
just like you waffles and chicken there.

1063
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:36,740
It looks that's,
that's,

1064
01:03:36,741 --> 01:03:38,970
that's doesn't look as good
as it looks when you're there.

1065
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:42,960
When you're there and you smell it.
It's damn good doing a,

1066
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:45,270
Roscoe is commercial here
but an incredible, I'm a fan.

1067
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,920
That's an incredible combination of items.

1068
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,160
It's so good. And afterwards you
better have nothing to do man.

1069
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:57,930
Food Coma Son.
Anyway,

1070
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,860
how do we get to that?
W W I dunno fry,

1071
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,260
you may lose syrup stories
going to different countries,

1072
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:06,630
different countries in opening
your mind. So you read it. Yeah.

1073
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:11,280
So you are counteracting my resin
flavored white wine with these maple syrup

1074
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,780
syrup. Well, I'm a, I'm a
giant fan of spicy food.

1075
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,530
I love spicy foods. I really,
really enjoyed Thailand. Uh,

1076
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:23,440
I really enjoyed their style of cooking
and they're kind of food and it's just

1077
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,860
one of those people who, who eats
those Scofield units on the, uh,

1078
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:32,070
on the hot peppers. Like, you know like
how hot, you know? No, I just like spicy,

1079
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:35,140
not high hot and they're like
Habanero. I liked it. I like put,

1080
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,500
it's pretty spicy compared
to the average person,

1081
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,160
but I have friends that put
me to shame. Yeah, like a,

1082
01:04:40,161 --> 01:04:43,170
I have a buddy of mine from that I used
to do for your factor with my friend

1083
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:46,590
Tommy Hirsch.
Go shout out to Tommy and I used to eat.

1084
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:51,370
I ate chili with him and I
couldn't feel how hard he can go.

1085
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:52,980
I'm like, this is crazy. Yes.

1086
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:57,240
I think people just have a different
inherent like it's almost like built into

1087
01:04:57,241 --> 01:05:00,630
their bodies both. I think it's
both. Some people are better able,

1088
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:02,250
it's like some are faster
runners than others,

1089
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:05,250
but it's also training so you get to,
you eat alone,

1090
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,710
you slowly work your way up
to being able to tolerate.

1091
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:11,340
Unlike those really super hot peppers.
I, I find it a very unpleasant,

1092
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:14,130
I have a friend just like
you who really is into it,

1093
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,220
like really seeks out the hotness.
I also think it's a bit like addiction,

1094
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:22,300
like you tolerate like, like as you
get used to like the less hot stuff,

1095
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:26,020
now you need more and more stuff in
order to get the same. It's not exactly,

1096
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:28,840
some people think it's a high by the way,
but there's a little high to it.

1097
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:31,780
Some people say that I, I mean,
I, again, it's not for me.

1098
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,060
I cook meat with Jalapenos.

1099
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:38,020
I slice it up and I'll have like a piece
of the meat with the Jalapenos to get,

1100
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:42,760
especially elk with Jalapenos
and sensational. So good. Yes.

1101
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,630
Yeah. But my kids always make
fun of me because I'm bald.

1102
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:51,010
So my whole head is covered with sweat
and they'd come over and wipe my hands

1103
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,100
like, you're so gross. And
then how old are your kids?

1104
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,210
The youngest ones are eight and 10. And
you have, you have, uh, how many? Three.

1105
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:02,650
I have three daughters. All daughters,
two year old, a 10 year old and an eight.

1106
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:06,970
You'll live longer, uh, with daughters.
If you, if you, if you plot, uh,

1107
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:12,060
Dad's survival on the y axis and fraction
of female children on the x axis,

1108
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,820
a survival is slightly longer for men
who have higher fraction of daughters,

1109
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:19,420
his children because boys drive you
to your fucking grave cause they're so

1110
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:22,780
goddamn crazy. There's lots of theories
as to why it happens. But I think,

1111
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:27,220
and that is in fact one of them, it's
framed a bit more scientifically. Well by,

1112
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,550
it's the basic theory. My 10 year old
is a maniac, my 10 year old daughters.

1113
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,260
And I just imagine if she was a boy,

1114
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:35,430
I'd be terrified that she knows
just lighting things on fire.

1115
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:40,660
Blowing up buildings. Yes. Yeah.
Boys are a problem. That can be,

1116
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:45,520
I mean, I think, yeah, I mean I
think, um, you know, I think it's,

1117
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:47,630
um, I think, um,

1118
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,070
well, I mean we could get onto the whole
gender issue. I'm not sure we want to,

1119
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:59,020
but I think boys are responsible. It,
let's talk about chimpanzees. It's easier.

1120
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,320
Okay.
Mail chimp's a do most of the violence,

1121
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:06,820
but 95% of the violence in murders
are committed by male chimpanzees.

1122
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,500
And most of the victims are males.
And um, you know, I think it's,

1123
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:13,330
there's no doubt that,
um,

1124
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,680
biology plays a very important role in
male proclivity to violence, for example.

1125
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:21,540
So instead of trouble. Yeah. So the boys
can be a problem that way. And Yeah,

1126
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:26,890
and I think the many ways in which s a
society are of cultural traits that we

1127
01:07:27,221 --> 01:07:27,701
invent,

1128
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:32,701
their purpose is to shape and guide
those tendencies to violence to kind of

1129
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:37,280
mitigate them. But we don't just need,
again, going back to the books or observe,

1130
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:41,740
please do. We don't just need, uh, we
don't just use culture for that purpose.

1131
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,800
There are, there's an argument
in the book that we humans have,

1132
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:49,360
have domesticated ourselves.
So if you look at,

1133
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:54,510
if you compare a dogs to wolves and
domesticated cats to wild cats from which

1134
01:07:55,901 --> 01:07:56,734
they descended,

1135
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,940
or a Guinea pigs to the wild Guinea
pigs from which they descended or,

1136
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:05,140
or horses to, uh, to the wild horses, to
which they sent a few again and again,

1137
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:07,480
you compare these couplets,
these pears,

1138
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:10,720
you find that the domesticated version
of these animals that are much more

1139
01:08:10,721 --> 01:08:14,470
placid, much more peaceful, they
also tend to have floppy ears.

1140
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,010
They have for,

1141
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,120
so Guinea pigs and dogs and
cows all have splotchy black,

1142
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:22,430
white and Brown for why is that?

1143
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,730
The animals from which they evolved didn't
have those, the kind of splotchiness.

1144
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,020
So,
uh,

1145
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:32,080
and they become much more peaceful
if you compare a human beings and,

1146
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:35,930
but they had a, uh, the, the, those
animals were domesticated by humans.

1147
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,190
Like I deliberately allowed
the reproduction of this
member of the litter and

1148
01:08:40,191 --> 01:08:43,190
not that member because this
member was, was, was nicer.

1149
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:47,990
And so across time we evolve a more a
domesticated version of the ancestral

1150
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:52,550
species. So we get, we get my miniature
Dachsund from a wolf, like the wound,

1151
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,460
like the kind of things that were
photographed out in your studio here.

1152
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,270
Crazy transition.
Uh,

1153
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:04,430
now if you look at humans
and you compare us to, uh,

1154
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:05,870
to the,

1155
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:11,170
the non to our ancestors or to
other primates for all the world,

1156
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:14,840
it looks like we have been domesticated.
We are more peaceful and placid.

1157
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:18,470
We have sex outside.
Non Reproductive sex is another thing.

1158
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:21,360
So these domesticated
animals we'll have sex, uh,

1159
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:26,090
even when it's not time to
reproduce. Uh, we, uh, we, um,

1160
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:31,550
uh, we, our tails, we don't have tails
anymore, but our tails have get shortened.

1161
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,430
There are all these features that we have,
these,

1162
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:38,450
these behavioral qualities and these
physical properties that we have are,

1163
01:09:38,451 --> 01:09:42,890
are we get a feminization of our faces.
Our jaws become smaller.

1164
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:43,701
Like if you look at,

1165
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:48,320
you compare these domesticated animals
to their non domesticated ancestors,

1166
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,390
the domestic version are less violence.

1167
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:54,180
So we lose a lot of the traits
that physical and, and, uh, um,

1168
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,660
psychological traits
associated with violence.

1169
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,500
But there was no one that domesticated
us. So the theory is, the question is how,

1170
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:04,310
how did that happen? And one of the
theories that's discussed in, in, uh,

1171
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:07,820
in blueprint and that's advanced by
other scientists, this is not my work,

1172
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,830
is that we self domesticated.

1173
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:14,270
And that what happened over the centuries,
over the millennia,

1174
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,220
over millions of years,

1175
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,390
is that weaker individuals
into our groups.

1176
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:25,580
When one individual became too autocratic
and too violent and too powerful,

1177
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,220
they banded together and kill that guy.

1178
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,620
And so over time we were killing the
more violent members of our species,

1179
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:38,360
weeding out those people, and therefore
the gene pool changed across time.

1180
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,100
And we self domesticated.

1181
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:45,101
We are more peaceful today than we
would have been because we domesticated

1182
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,490
ourselves.

1183
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:50,660
And this is one of the arguments that's
also made to help explain the origins of

1184
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:51,620
goodness actually,

1185
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,880
and the origins of cooperation because
it would take a few good diesel to kill

1186
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:59,930
the bad person that's running everything
that's evil. Correct. It's exactly right.

1187
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,880
Recreational sex does occur in Bonobos,
which is really weird,

1188
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:08,030
isn't it? Because they're so
similar to regular chimps. Yes,

1189
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,420
but they're not the same species.
They also have homosexual sex. Uh,

1190
01:11:11,421 --> 01:11:14,100
they use sex to make,
you know,

1191
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,450
so, uh, it, it's, yeah, they're
very licentious a species.

1192
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:20,700
That's exactly right. And, and, and,

1193
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:25,080
and Bonobos are felt to be a self
domesticated chimpanzee. So the similar,

1194
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,870
so bonobos are to chimps as uh,

1195
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:32,100
as let's say dogs are to wolves and,
but there was the dogs,

1196
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:34,800
we domesticate it. The Banabos
self domesticated as the theory.

1197
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:39,370
Do they know why or how? Well,
the theory is that they did it.

1198
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,930
Like we were saying by weeding out killing
the more of aggressive members it was,

1199
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,860
what we know must have happened is that
the nicer guys must have been able to

1200
01:11:46,861 --> 01:11:48,960
have more offspring.

1201
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:53,400
So the gene pool changed over time because
of the differential success of the,

1202
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:57,780
of the, of the nicer guys. Now people have
looked at this even in human societies,

1203
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:58,890
they've looked,
for instance,

1204
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:03,540
there's a study I talk about in the book
of different pathways to reproductive

1205
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:08,541
success amongst that Samani which is a
group in Amazonia and other societies are

1206
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:10,284
similar.

1207
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:15,290
So you can either be like big and strong
or you can be charismatic and have

1208
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:20,750
useful knowledge in both ways.
You have more children. Mm.

1209
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:24,370
Um, so there are these competing ways, uh,

1210
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,080
in our species of enhancing
your reproductive fitness.

1211
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:32,100
Are you aware of [inaudible]
work with, um, baboons?

1212
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:37,110
That's a fascinating case, right? Because
they were studying baboons in Africa.

1213
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:39,000
They would eat from human garbage,

1214
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:42,630
and a bunch of them got sick and died.

1215
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:47,160
And it turns out that the most violent
and ruthless of them got sick and died.

1216
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:51,360
And it changed the entire culture of the
baboons tribe. I don't know that story.

1217
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,830
That's an interesting one.

1218
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:56,550
Little sterling grooming each other and
being kind to each other. Oh my God. Yeah.

1219
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:59,070
That's a good example.
But there was an accidental,

1220
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:02,700
it was an accident is an accident. And
you had, it lasted for generations. Yes.

1221
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:04,560
And when he returned to study them,

1222
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:09,090
he found that they were still this
different kind of contrite about this a

1223
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:12,670
little bit. Yeah. I'm doing a shitty
job. I'm sure I'm explaining it, but I'm,

1224
01:13:12,671 --> 01:13:17,070
I know, I think could have the
fascinate. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yes. He's very impressive.

1225
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:21,450
And a, I know the, I, I, I'm,
uh, now that you're reminding me,

1226
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:23,250
I'm a little familiar with
that particular study.

1227
01:13:23,251 --> 01:13:25,860
I did know that it started with
garbage, however, that Janet,

1228
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:30,300
it was a coincidental x extermination of
the more violent members of the troop.

1229
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:31,021
Yes.
Yeah.

1230
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:34,740
So they were removed from the gene pool
and it changed the entire culture to the

1231
01:13:34,741 --> 01:13:39,741
point where generations later they were
still using this more peaceful ways.

1232
01:13:40,771 --> 01:13:44,950
Full. Yeah, yeah, yeah. More kind.
Well, it didn't just change the culture.

1233
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,410
It may have changed the culture,

1234
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:49,260
but it appears we're arguing
the two of changing gene pool,

1235
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,920
second evolutionary pressure that's
been applied. So you have, you know,

1236
01:13:52,921 --> 01:13:56,010
big dogs and small dogs.
You don't allow the big ones to reproduce.

1237
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:59,010
You just reproduce the small ones. Yeah.
You get small dogs in the end. Well,

1238
01:13:59,011 --> 01:14:02,850
I've had dogs my whole life.
And one of the things that you do kind of,

1239
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:06,810
I right now have a golden
retriever. Uh, we have, uh,
we, yeah, we have a white lab.

1240
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,860
Yeah. A yellow lab. And, uh, I've
had a bunch of different dogs.

1241
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,430
Mastiffs and pit bulls and
German shepherds, no small,
we have a docksin too.

1242
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:18,310
You don't have small dogs.
My oldest daughter has a tiny Chihuahua.

1243
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:21,910
It's a pays off. Sorry that he's the
best. They just bark all the time now.

1244
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:23,950
He doesn't bark that much. He
barks a little bit, but he's,

1245
01:14:23,951 --> 01:14:25,570
he's really smart and
he's actually a Mutt.

1246
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:29,920
He's Chihuahua and Australian shepherd,
but he's like that big, it's tiny,

1247
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:33,240
tiny little thing and
he's the best. But um, um,

1248
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:38,080
my point being is that you can see
if you get a dog from a breeder,

1249
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:41,920
you really can see how they can
cultivate certain types of behavior.

1250
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:45,670
Like a good example of my mass
tiff who passed away this year,

1251
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
he came from this guy who bred dogs
for films and for a police training.

1252
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:57,850
And uh, he was the most calm, most
chilled out dog I've ever had in my life.

1253
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:01,540
He was a giant dog.
He's 140 pounds, but he,

1254
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:04,660
you could have them take him anywhere and
trust him with a baby. And he was like,

1255
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:05,494
hello.

1256
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,760
Like everything was like totally
he but this guy purposely,

1257
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:13,570
anytime a dog showed any aggression
towards people or any aggression towards

1258
01:15:13,571 --> 01:15:14,650
dogs,
he wouldn't let them breed.

1259
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,410
So how can anyone not hear
the stories like that or no?

1260
01:15:17,411 --> 01:15:20,800
Stories like that and not then also
think that genes play a role in human

1261
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:22,900
behavior. You have children. Yes.

1262
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:26,440
You realize when you have children
you see it like, okay, this is not,

1263
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:29,830
I didn't do this. This is,
this comes from me. Yes.

1264
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:33,730
There's certain traits that my children
have that I watch and I go, okay,

1265
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:37,810
this is not, this is teach them.
They just started, they were born,

1266
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:41,330
this is what got my fucked up brain.
You know, there's something in there.

1267
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:43,330
They're not seeing that.

1268
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:47,590
Like they don't see how crazy I am in
terms of like how hard I work, things,

1269
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,820
how obsessive I get with things
they're just doing and it's very weird.

1270
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,210
It's very weird because
you see, oh well, okay,

1271
01:15:55,211 --> 01:16:00,211
well how much of this shit that's in me
is like how much of me is me deciding to

1272
01:16:00,491 --> 01:16:05,170
be this person and how much of me has no
choice? About half and half. I would say.

1273
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,300
Overall on average across traits,

1274
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:12,070
how much do you think gets passed
down through genetics in terms of

1275
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:16,050
inclinations? Like like the
nature of physicians? Yeah,

1276
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:20,230
about half on average. So for
example, about half the Wii,

1277
01:16:20,231 --> 01:16:24,760
you know how religious you are or
how risk averse you are. Like I can,

1278
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,170
I can about half the variation in how if
you look at a group of people and some

1279
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:30,340
are more risk averse than others,

1280
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:33,400
about about half of that has to do with
their jeans and half has to do with how

1281
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:36,970
they were raised or what environments
they grew up in. So you know,

1282
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:41,110
there's a kind of innateness to many of
our qualities and you can shape them.

1283
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,780
You know, for example, you can't,
you couldn't make me a musician.

1284
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:47,380
Unfortunately I have almost no musical
talent. I can dance I think. I mean,

1285
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:51,460
I think others would even say that I can
do that. Uh, but um, does not just like,

1286
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:56,110
I think I can dance, but I can't. Uh, but
I, I have no musical ability whatsoever.

1287
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:59,320
I would say I'm tone deaf and, and you
know, I can appreciate music I like,

1288
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:03,160
but I can't produce it.
There's no way you could train me,

1289
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:07,060
I don't think to be a
musician. Um, but, um,

1290
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:09,980
so some of it is inborn and some of it is,
is a,

1291
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,050
is taught for all of these qualities.
Yes.

1292
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:16,790
It's a fascinating thing to watch it
emerge from a child, isn't it? Yes.

1293
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,470
As a parent you see where it comes from.
Although we have adopted, like, I, um,

1294
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,550
my mother had three biological children
and I have two adopted siblings that

1295
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:27,200
come from actually a multiracial family.

1296
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:29,120
I have a black sister
and a Chinese brother.

1297
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,280
And My mother was an incredible human
being. She died when I was a 25.

1298
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:39,160
She was 47. Uh, and, uh, we have been
foster parents, my wife and I, and,

1299
01:17:39,161 --> 01:17:40,350
and so,
and might,

1300
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:43,550
we have lots of adopted kids in the
extended family in addition to biological

1301
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:47,540
kids. And so you can see, you
can see the play of genes.

1302
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:49,930
You could see the extent to which the,
the,

1303
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:54,380
the kind of inherited traits that
these people that we all have.

1304
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:57,860
And you'll see the shaping by
how you're raised and you know,

1305
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:01,240
so both are important. And this is
incidentally why if you ever have anyone,

1306
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,560
it's not,
it's not nature or nurture.

1307
01:18:03,561 --> 01:18:07,370
It's both always almost in
every single trait actually.

1308
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,190
Well that's the case of so
many things in this life.

1309
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:15,020
We want everything to be
binaries. Yes. It's, it's nuts.

1310
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:16,880
It's a total,
we were talking earlier,

1311
01:18:16,881 --> 01:18:21,881
it's a total loss of nuance and
an inability to see any gray and,

1312
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,490
and, and some people think, and I think
that's what you were talking about,

1313
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:30,590
some people think that we are
hardwired to like dichotomies to see,

1314
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:31,160
you know,

1315
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:36,160
male and female and an up and down
and good and evil and left and right.

1316
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:39,560
And to simplify the world by finding it.
And that we like it,

1317
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:43,490
that it soothing to us to think that
the world can be divided into two

1318
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:45,650
categories,
but in fact,

1319
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:49,040
many times not always like
up and down is sort of clear,

1320
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:53,960
but many times it can't.
They're shades of gray and it's harder.

1321
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:57,770
That's harder to live in the
gray. Yes. I completely agree.

1322
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,200
And that's why I've always been a po.
I mean,

1323
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,440
I think it's an incredibly
foolish to deny that,

1324
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:07,490
but people find comfort in denying
they find comfort in main tribal.

1325
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:12,280
You find confidence in them. Yeah. US
versus them. This is the classic. Yes,

1326
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:16,490
yes, yes. It's, it's a, it's a
simplified view of the world and it's,

1327
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:19,670
it's foolish and dangerous
actually. Yeah. Um,

1328
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,230
now sometimes you're at war with an enemy,
you know,

1329
01:19:24,231 --> 01:19:27,140
it's me or him and uh,
or us or them,

1330
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,170
there are circumstances in which
it's a different survival. Yes.

1331
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:35,000
Or survival in that mode. Yeah.
I get it. But, um, but you know,

1332
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:39,470
but I think the a kind of worldview
which says we are good, they are evil.

1333
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:43,400
Um, as we've been saying in different
kind of ways in different parts of our

1334
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:47,420
conversation is I think foolish and
wrong and ultimately self-injurious.

1335
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:52,130
Actually. Um, so we used
to have a, you know,

1336
01:19:52,131 --> 01:19:55,520
you've done martial arts, I spent
years training and showed ICAN karate.

1337
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:57,740
It's very traditional Japanese style,
which I loved.

1338
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,740
I'm sure you've had the same thing.

1339
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:04,640
You actually are grateful for your up to
your opponent. You Mount your opponent,

1340
01:20:04,641 --> 01:20:08,070
you say thank you to your opponent,
right? Sure. Component is necessary for

1341
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,890
you to learn. Oh yeah. I
mean this is the whole point,

1342
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,720
not just your opponent training partners.

1343
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,620
You don't want people to be able
to beat you. Yes. You get better.

1344
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:21,330
That's exactly right. So, um, so this
is, you know, I think that the kind of,

1345
01:20:21,331 --> 01:20:25,890
that aspect of that kind of training
is, um, is a life lesson as well, right?

1346
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:29,010
The capacity to see that in
the same happens with ideas.

1347
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:30,450
How to my ideas get better.

1348
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:34,980
How do I discover in my laboratory new
knowledge I discovered against opposition,

1349
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:39,870
right? Someone says, you're
wrong about that. It's not
true. And I'm like, Oh yeah,

1350
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:41,490
let me prove it to you.
Here's what,

1351
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:43,920
I'm going to go back and do more
experiments and come back to you with more

1352
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:48,690
arguments and more data and show you that
actually I'm right about this or not.

1353
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:53,340
You go back to your lab and you're like,
oh shit, they were right. We were wrong.

1354
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,700
So that's the way you uncover truth,
right?

1355
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:01,560
It's the way you get to bore perfection.
It's the kind of ying and Yang actually.

1356
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,370
So, uh, so, so yes, I think that, um,

1357
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:10,710
I think that this, this, this, this,
the simplification of the world,

1358
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:15,720
um, to think of, you know,
I'm good and your evil is, um,

1359
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,390
really misunderstands that in many,
not all,

1360
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:20,640
but in many circumstances and
misunderstands what's happening.

1361
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:25,710
And also it brings back this problem that
human beings have always had with ego

1362
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,290
and this need to be right.

1363
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:33,410
And that identifying yourself in each
individual discussion and debate and

1364
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:38,730
battle and needing to triumph.
And even though you desire to be correct,

1365
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:40,530
you have to understand when you are not.

1366
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:44,820
And you have to appreciate someone who
shows you that you are incorrect because

1367
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:47,610
they are allowing you to grow your nest,
a finished product.

1368
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:49,260
There's no way you can be.
Yes.

1369
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:52,710
I think that's why I like arguing with
people I disagree with because that's

1370
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:55,410
when I learned more stuff. Right.
If I talk to people I agree with,

1371
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:58,740
I don't learn as much. So you get together
with our private roads do that dude.

1372
01:21:58,741 --> 01:22:03,150
And some other dudes I have saw is I
just came from his house and uh, he also,

1373
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,250
he's crazy.
But anyway,

1374
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,380
he'll laugh. He will listen to this and
this and he'll be laughing right now.

1375
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:12,270
Does he do for a living? He's
a financier. No fucking way.

1376
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:17,190
God Damn. That's cliche. Yes,
exactly. That's hilarious. Is

1377
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,830
So, um, it is hilarious.
Anyway, pro gun mercenary.

1378
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:23,883
Yeah.

1379
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:30,410
Fries. Yeah, we saw that
coming. That's really funny.

1380
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:31,840
The um,
oh,

1381
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:34,460
what was the hold on I was going to say
something to you about you arguing with

1382
01:22:34,461 --> 01:22:37,550
people you disagree with. Um, hold
on. I lost the train of thought.

1383
01:22:37,551 --> 01:22:41,630
I had said before we talked about my
friend. Uh, you learn from them. Anyway.

1384
01:22:41,631 --> 01:22:46,130
I lost the train there, but no worries.
Yeah. Um, so, uh, yeah, I mean that's,

1385
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:49,910
that's another issue that I've faced with
this podcast where people get upset at

1386
01:22:49,911 --> 01:22:54,500
me for having people on that have
opinions that they disagree with.

1387
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:56,570
That's nuts. Yeah. They
think that you, you're,

1388
01:22:56,780 --> 01:23:00,670
you're doing a disservice by
providing a platform that's not that,

1389
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:04,850
that's phrase they keep saying platform,
giving them a platform.

1390
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:10,120
I think you have power, uh,
which you should use wisely.
I have power. I should use,

1391
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:14,170
like we all have some power and some
parts of our lives and I think it is okay

1392
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:17,470
to say you have some
power. You do. You know,

1393
01:23:17,471 --> 01:23:21,700
you have lots of millions of
listeners, people respect you. Um,

1394
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,730
lots of people are both presidents,
CEOs, they're people of power.

1395
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,750
But the idea that by talking to someone,

1396
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:32,110
you are somehow abusing that power.
That's, that's crazy to me. In fact,

1397
01:23:32,111 --> 01:23:32,831
quite the opposite.

1398
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:37,831
I think that you are shining
bright light of day onto a ideas.

1399
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:42,460
Let people discuss them. Look, let's,
it's also quite schizophrenia. I mean,

1400
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:45,580
have you ever seen one, the
schizophrenia person draws these, uh,

1401
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:50,080
connections where they have one person
and that person met this other person and

1402
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:53,480
that person used to work with this other
person and that person met Hitler. Yeah.

1403
01:23:53,481 --> 01:23:56,640
So, you know, Hitler, yes. Know
you've ever seen those. And yes,

1404
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,930
it's really similar in
the same sort of a way.

1405
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:04,200
It's this weird sort of a thing where
you're not allowed to even communicate or

1406
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:09,540
be in contact with someone who is
in this apoe. And it's a myth. It's,

1407
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:12,850
it's very childlike. Yes.
This, this perspective.

1408
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:15,900
And it's very by an area and my friend
in your Susie's friend. Exactly.

1409
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,150
So fucking stupid. Yes. I would
agree with that. And it's a,

1410
01:24:19,151 --> 01:24:22,060
it's a really common thing today that you,

1411
01:24:22,061 --> 01:24:26,260
you're seeing people are
trying to reinforce this
idea in and push it on other

1412
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:28,940
folks. Well, I think one
thing, you know, like I think,

1413
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:33,410
um, I think that, um, like
we were talking about,

1414
01:24:33,411 --> 01:24:38,330
I think that exposing ourselves
to a breadth of ideas to
people we disagree with.

1415
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,430
I, you know, I think and,

1416
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:45,200
and creating an environment
in which people can express
themselves. Um, you know,

1417
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:48,100
it is good. You're not going to get
any arguments from me against on that,

1418
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,203
on that point.

1419
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:53,320
No. Um, and I, I just think
it's better for everybody.

1420
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:54,640
Like we were talking about before,

1421
01:24:54,641 --> 01:24:58,250
when you meet someone who
can give you a lesson and,

1422
01:24:58,251 --> 01:25:02,950
and express something in a way that makes
you reconsider your own ideas that you

1423
01:25:02,951 --> 01:25:05,030
hold sacred. I mean, I'll
give you an example. Apple,

1424
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:09,990
when I, when I, I met
my wife 30 years ago, I,

1425
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,710
I wasn't pro death penalty,
but I was,

1426
01:25:12,711 --> 01:25:15,560
I would say I would say have neutral
to the death penalty. I would be like,

1427
01:25:15,561 --> 01:25:18,800
you know, ted Bundy, the
state can put him to death

1428
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,880
and I had all the kind of conventional
reasons or I didn't really care.

1429
01:25:22,881 --> 01:25:25,280
He's a vile person. He killed all
these people. He tortured them.

1430
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:29,210
If the families will get any
relief or whatever, that's fine.

1431
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:34,460
I had some concerns because I was this
statistician about a conviction of the

1432
01:25:34,461 --> 01:25:38,510
innocent and I support the
innocence project and I am
very concerned with police

1433
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:42,380
brutality. I have for years
been advocating the racializing,

1434
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:45,590
the police brutality is
vile and, and uh, uh,

1435
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:50,180
port and must be firmly
resisted. Uh, I think that, um,

1436
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,890
I think the,
the,

1437
01:25:51,891 --> 01:25:55,880
the prosecutorial misconduct way people
are prosecutors lie and put people in

1438
01:25:55,881 --> 01:25:58,130
prison. Uh, you know, there've been many,

1439
01:25:58,131 --> 01:26:01,490
many cases of people on death row who
were innocent that should offend our

1440
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:02,324
conscience.

1441
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:07,340
So even back then I had some concerns
about the death penalty because I, um,

1442
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,760
because I, I recognize that,
you know, we can't be perfect.

1443
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:14,120
We're going to convict some innocent
people and also let some guilty people go

1444
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:17,630
free. That's not as bad as killing
the putting to death. He innocent,

1445
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:21,080
but they're both bad. So I had that
concern about the death penalty,

1446
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:25,220
but otherwise I was like, it's okay.
My opinions have totally changed.

1447
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:27,740
I'm completely opposed to the
death penalty now for many reasons.

1448
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:31,520
Not just the statistical reason,
but also I think it's immoral.

1449
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:32,830
I don't think the state should put into,

1450
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,700
I think we can rip deprive you of liberty.

1451
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,370
I think we can make sure
you're not a threat to society.

1452
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:40,790
We can block you up for the rest
of your life. But I think we,

1453
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:43,820
the state should not be taking
people's lives in that way.

1454
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:47,840
There's something extraordinarily
strange about locking someone up.

1455
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:52,040
It's very strange. Well, we have a
carceral state. I mean, you know,

1456
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,570
we lock up a higher we have is,

1457
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:57,470
we are fraction of people incarcerated
I think is the same as Stalinist Russia

1458
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:00,500
and we have very long prison sentences,
which are nuts.

1459
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:04,040
You don't need them for deterrence,
for nonviolent drug,

1460
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:07,210
especially for non all nonviolent
offenses should have much shorter prison

1461
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:11,390
doesn't, we should have more. We should
have higher certainty of punishment.

1462
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:13,910
Higher fraction of people
who have actually committed
crimes should be punished.

1463
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:17,160
But I think we should,
we could cut in half or less the,

1464
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:20,320
the duration of the census. I
think you'll be able to, uh,

1465
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:24,050
deter criminals from doing things with
a three month sentence if they are very

1466
01:27:24,051 --> 01:27:26,780
confident that they will be
convicted if they're caught.

1467
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:31,070
Whereas now we have a system where
most are not convicted like this Jesse

1468
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:35,510
smallest thing, which is just
ridiculous in the news. And, uh, uh,

1469
01:27:35,511 --> 01:27:39,610
and which therefore the, and only
a tiny fraction are convicted and,

1470
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,240
but they're giving huge lung sentences.

1471
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:43,190
It's like they're paying the
sentence for everyone that didn't,

1472
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:47,090
it doesn't make any sense. And it, it's
expensive at ties up our prison system.

1473
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:50,690
Actually, can I go to
tell you the story? True.

1474
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:55,810
So it was a situation a few years
ago when there's a very famous, um,

1475
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,350
uh, director and writer by the name of
David Simon, who I consider a friend.

1476
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:04,100
He did the wire, he was a show runner
for a bunch of other very famous, uh,

1477
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,040
wonderful, uh, TV programs.

1478
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:11,030
Now he started his career actually
as a reporter in a, in Baltimore.

1479
01:28:11,031 --> 01:28:14,270
He was a beat reporter and then
went on to become a writer,

1480
01:28:14,271 --> 01:28:17,930
did the wire and so forth.
And he told the story, uh,

1481
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:23,020
actually at Yale to students about how
he had just come back from a summit.

1482
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:27,980
President Obama was still president where
he was trying to help the students to

1483
01:28:27,981 --> 01:28:32,150
see that you could find common ground
with your political opponents and that you

1484
01:28:32,151 --> 01:28:36,860
need to listen to them and talk to them
in order to, to find that ground, uh, if,

1485
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:39,390
and so he told the following
story, he said, I had,

1486
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:42,830
I just came back from Camp David where,
uh,

1487
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,430
there was a meeting about how to
reduce incarceration in our society.

1488
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:50,930
And he said the Koch brothers were there
and the students all hissed and Newt

1489
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:51,950
Gingrich was there and the students,

1490
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:54,440
all hissed and a bunch of
liberal people were there.

1491
01:28:54,441 --> 01:28:56,780
And the students were really happy
about that. And then they said, well,

1492
01:28:56,781 --> 01:29:00,380
why did you go, how could you associate
yourself with those evil people?

1493
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:01,950
And he said, look, you said

1494
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:06,270
the, the conservatives want to reduce
incarceration because it's expensive.

1495
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:10,200
The liberals want to reduce
incarceration because it's unjust.

1496
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:13,950
And the libertarians want to
reduce incarceration because
the state shouldn't be

1497
01:29:13,951 --> 01:29:15,090
depriving people of Liberty.

1498
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:19,230
And I can find common ground with
these people and reduce incarceration.

1499
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:23,640
Why would I not talk to them? And the
students didn't seem to understand that.

1500
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:26,070
They were like,
they couldn't get it.

1501
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:31,310
That's why they shouldn't
be able to vote to be 33,

1502
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,210
25. I mean, and so I don't know
how we got onto this, you know,

1503
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:39,000
like talking to you is so much fun because
it's like we're all over the place.

1504
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:40,680
But, um, how did I get it?

1505
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:43,200
Come up with this example we were talking
about talking to her political enemies.

1506
01:29:43,201 --> 01:29:44,100
Was it or something else?

1507
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:48,380
We're talking about people telling
you that you shouldn't associate yes.

1508
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,870
People that have varying opinions.
Yes, yes. And you know, Oh and no.

1509
01:29:51,871 --> 01:29:54,840
We were talking about an incarceration
and prison sensors and so forth.

1510
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:58,530
So we have a horrible problem in our
society with, with incarceration.

1511
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,080
A larger fraction of our
populace is incarcerated.

1512
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:05,130
We deprive after you paid your debt to
society, we often have these, these, uh,

1513
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,440
we deprive you of your right to vote,
which I think is wrong.

1514
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:11,160
You've paid your debt to society.
You should be able to reenter society.

1515
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:16,050
That's exactly, yes. Exactly.
You were in prison for 10 years.

1516
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,360
That's enough. You don't, now you, we
want you to feel a part of society.

1517
01:30:19,361 --> 01:30:22,260
Can we want to welcome you back
if we have that vision of justice?

1518
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:26,640
How about the registered sex offender?
That's a serious problem. Especially for,

1519
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,020
uh, crimes. You know, the, these crazy
cases which offend my conscience.

1520
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:35,790
I know a guy who got
charged as a registered sex
offender because he urinated

1521
01:30:35,791 --> 01:30:40,770
outside. Yeah. That's not caught in the
south urinating outside. That's nuts.

1522
01:30:40,771 --> 01:30:43,320
That's just a prosecutorial abuse.
Or you know,

1523
01:30:43,321 --> 01:30:46,710
you have these Romeo and
Juliet laws, which are not in
every state now. Thank God,

1524
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:50,550
alas, last, they are not in
every state. Uh, you know,

1525
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:53,310
you have a 16 year old boy
and a 14 year old girl.

1526
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:56,580
There have to be exceptions for that
kind of sexual practice. You know,

1527
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:59,580
they're exchanging a
sexually explicit images.

1528
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,940
They should not be considered sex
offenders for the rest of their lives.

1529
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:07,650
That's nuts. So, um, so
yeah, so all of those things.

1530
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:08,290
So the,

1531
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:11,130
but the problem is not only do we have
a huge fraction of people in prison,

1532
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,910
we have extremely long prison sentences
compared to any many European countries

1533
01:31:14,911 --> 01:31:19,800
for the same crime and a, it's
costly. It's unjust, it's ineffective.

1534
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:23,730
I think. I think we should change the
policies on this and maybe we will.

1535
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:29,490
There's also the idea of
reforming them. It's, it's,

1536
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:32,340
they're not using all the
tools within their disposal.

1537
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:34,560
They're not really giving
a good attempted it.

1538
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:38,760
And I just don't think it does anything
other than make their life hell for a

1539
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:39,690
short period of time,

1540
01:31:39,691 --> 01:31:44,100
which we're hoping we hope deters
them from doing future crime. Well,

1541
01:31:44,101 --> 01:31:47,490
they're different. There's the justice,
there's deterrent there. Safety, right?

1542
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:51,610
Like so violent criminals that we put
in jail. Uh, we need to do that. I mean,

1543
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:54,080
I'm not interested in being
killed by somebody who, you know,

1544
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:57,660
could it killed someone else. She should
have busy in jail, uh, for a while,

1545
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,180
20 years.
So I'm at a time from larder.

1546
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,780
Yeah, for murder. I think
20 years is enough. Well,

1547
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:05,673
a European,

1548
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:10,690
a European standards are
about 20 years actually.

1549
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,600
And there are different things like
if you want to deprive them, if your,

1550
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:16,240
if your vision is they're being
punished for the killing of a life,

1551
01:32:16,241 --> 01:32:17,710
therefore they've surrendered their life.

1552
01:32:17,711 --> 01:32:20,890
It's sort of eye for an eye
kind of justice. You would,

1553
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,760
they would be the rest of
their lives. And you know, I,

1554
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:26,260
we can debate whether that's
reasonable or not. If you,

1555
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:28,930
if you want to provide
a public safety reason,

1556
01:32:28,931 --> 01:32:32,650
people often age out of their violence.
So a lot of men,

1557
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:36,100
typically these were talking mostly about
men who do these things. Uh, you know,

1558
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:37,690
by the time they're in
their forties or 50s,

1559
01:32:37,691 --> 01:32:41,600
they're much less violent to stoss
declines. They get older and wiser. Uh,

1560
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,560
they're not interested in, in criminal,
in that kind of criminal behavior.

1561
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,690
Many of them are not.
So that does,

1562
01:32:46,691 --> 01:32:49,270
that suggests you don't need
life sentences for murder.

1563
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:52,720
And I think it also depends and we
have gradations of murder. You know,

1564
01:32:52,721 --> 01:32:56,320
we have like the impulsive stuff that
intent matters of planfulness matters,

1565
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:59,860
that depravity matters. All of
these things are, are factors.

1566
01:32:59,861 --> 01:33:03,550
And I don't think we should have a one
size fits all incarceration for murder.

1567
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,080
Yes. That's my opinion. What do you think?

1568
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,930
I think it depends entirely
on the circumstances.

1569
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:13,140
If two men are engaged in some sort of
a dispute and one winds up killing the

1570
01:33:13,661 --> 01:33:14,470
other one,

1571
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:17,230
that's a big difference between that
and someone breaking into your house and

1572
01:33:17,231 --> 01:33:21,280
killing your daughter. Yes. A correct.
And I also think even in that, like I,

1573
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:25,030
I really am opposed to these stand
your ground laws. I think those are,

1574
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:30,240
if you have the opportunity to avoid
conflict and to avoid you or not,

1575
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,630
uh, it, I would prefer as a state
to require that you walk away,

1576
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,580
even if it makes you feel embarrassed,
uh,

1577
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:41,230
then give you the right to kill
someone for offending you in those,

1578
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:44,080
those videos of the,
of the guys in that shot,

1579
01:33:44,081 --> 01:33:47,900
the guy on his knees in the parking lot
in the, I forgot what state it was like,

1580
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,910
uh, not long. A year or two ago. They got
into an altercation and the parking lot.

1581
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:55,570
Like, if I have words with someone, an
apartment shot guy on his knee. Yes.

1582
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,790
There was no threat to him.
And he was,

1583
01:33:57,791 --> 01:34:00,820
he was not prosecuted on the stand
your ground argument, which is nuts.

1584
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:04,180
Why was the guy on his knees?
He was, I forgot, I said,
don't shoot me or something.

1585
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:08,350
Oh, Jesus. So it was, it was crazy. He
didn't get prosecuted. I don't think so.

1586
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:10,420
We can look up the facts.
There were several cases.

1587
01:34:10,421 --> 01:34:12,850
There were several cases like
this, but you know, like,

1588
01:34:12,851 --> 01:34:15,130
I remember when I was doing,
showed a con karate,

1589
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:20,820
my Sensei Kazumi Tabata,
this was years ago, uh,

1590
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:23,830
the 30 years ago now. And he
told us the following story. He,

1591
01:34:23,831 --> 01:34:26,980
he said there was a Sensei
in this village in Japan,

1592
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:31,960
and the students were coming to the
Dojo. And, uh, there was the, the,

1593
01:34:31,961 --> 01:34:34,900
the best student that, you know,
and then all the other students,

1594
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:38,740
and they were walking through the village
and they passed the approach to horse

1595
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:42,790
that was on the street from the rear,
and it startled the horse.

1596
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:46,120
And as the horse reared up and
kicked its leg, the, the, uh,

1597
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:49,960
the best student instantly
did a kind of a avoidance,

1598
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:54,100
kind of twisted his body and avoided
the kick and the, and the, and the, uh,

1599
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:55,061
the horse,

1600
01:34:55,061 --> 01:34:58,100
his leg went right in front of him and
all the other students were amazed at his

1601
01:34:58,101 --> 01:35:01,340
ability and they get to the
Dojo and they tell the Sensei,

1602
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:05,780
this is my sensei telling me this story,
telling all of us this story. And they,

1603
01:35:05,781 --> 01:35:08,740
those students get to this, the
Dojo. And they tell that the Sensei,

1604
01:35:08,741 --> 01:35:10,490
the story marveling at the,

1605
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:15,380
at the ability of this master student
to definitely avoid the strike and the

1606
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:19,520
Sensei's very angry and he
don't understand why, why
is he so angry? He said,

1607
01:35:19,521 --> 01:35:21,560
if he were a really good student of mine,

1608
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:23,630
he would have walked on the
other side of the street.

1609
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,390
He would have avoided
the horse altogether.

1610
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:31,730
So the real wisdom is to avoid avoidance
of conflict in the first place.

1611
01:35:31,731 --> 01:35:36,350
There's no reason to seek out conflict.
And so on the stand your ground laws,

1612
01:35:36,351 --> 01:35:40,850
you know, if the choices ether you just
avoid the conflict, you know, someone,

1613
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:45,970
someone swore at you or called you an
asshole or was an unreasonable jerk that

1614
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:50,510
doesn't give you the right to
kill them. Right. Um, so anyway,

1615
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,040
I don't know how we got onto this as well.

1616
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:57,290
How are we going to the penalty
for, for murder. Exactly. Exactly.

1617
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,690
So, so, so different
gradations. Yeah. Yeah.

1618
01:35:59,691 --> 01:36:04,691
I just don't know how much of a
deterrent it is locking people up.

1619
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:06,980
I just, I, I'm not sure,

1620
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:10,280
I'm not really sure if that actually
stops people from doing things.

1621
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:13,580
I think it stops some people. I think
there've been academic research on this.

1622
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:18,610
I just don't think there's any real
rehabilitation other than personal choice.

1623
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:20,730
I mean, I think the, the,

1624
01:36:20,731 --> 01:36:24,890
the real rehabilitation comes from someone
making a personal choice to never be

1625
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:27,920
that person. That Dan again. Yes.
For most of them you're, you're,

1626
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:31,490
you're being locked up with a bunch
of hardened criminals and you, your,

1627
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,340
that's your,
your community.

1628
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:36,680
But you're not suggesting we have a
society in which when you commit violent

1629
01:36:36,681 --> 01:36:39,330
acts, we do nothing. No, I'm
not. No, I'm not. No, I'm,

1630
01:36:39,331 --> 01:36:42,260
I'm suggesting you're struggling with this
is what you're saying. Yeah. The, yeah.

1631
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:44,540
The concept of nuances. Yes. This is,

1632
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,120
this is a applied here
better than anywhere else.

1633
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:50,090
I think I got the impression looking at
your face a moment ago when I told my

1634
01:36:50,091 --> 01:36:54,380
sort of sweet Sensei, Japanese karate
story, that you didn't agree necessarily.

1635
01:36:54,381 --> 01:36:56,810
We know that's a very wise way
of looking at it. Yeah. Don't,

1636
01:36:56,811 --> 01:37:00,530
don't be near a fucking horse that
wants a kick. You very smart. Yeah.

1637
01:37:00,531 --> 01:37:04,930
Get out of there. I'm a big believer
in avoiding conflict. Yeah. I'm, I'm,

1638
01:37:04,931 --> 01:37:08,990
I'm the first guy to conflict, not
intellectual conflict. Right, exactly.

1639
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:13,040
Physical words and violence are
different access routes and very,

1640
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,390
extremely different. Yeah. I mean,

1641
01:37:14,391 --> 01:37:19,190
intellectual conflict at that is actually
important and you learn from it. Yes.

1642
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,940
Very rarely do you learn too much. Right.
I mean, you learned don't do that again,

1643
01:37:22,941 --> 01:37:26,060
that's going to learn from physical
conflicts. This don't do that again. Yes.

1644
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,610
I was just, it's just, you know what,

1645
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:31,610
what happens in nature with
animals happens with people.

1646
01:37:31,611 --> 01:37:35,990
If you let them get to that level and
it's scratched down to the, you know,

1647
01:37:35,991 --> 01:37:40,520
remove that thin film of society
with rocks.

1648
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:43,910
Yes, there we are violent. But I keep
coming back to what I argue in blueprint.

1649
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:44,760
You know, we, I have those, those

1650
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:48,860
tendencies, but equally we have
tendencies to be kind and friendly and uh,

1651
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:53,370
and it's, we have to create
the environment to, uh,
to foster those. I have a,

1652
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:57,360
there's sense in which,
and I talk about this in the book,

1653
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:01,380
there's a sense in which as
we create those environments,

1654
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:05,010
we actually change ourselves as a species.

1655
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:09,240
There's this a set of ideas that's
known as gene culture coevolution.

1656
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:12,720
And the idea is that we create certain
kinds of cultural environments,

1657
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:18,800
those kind of cultural
environments advantage certain
ones of us making those of

1658
01:38:19,411 --> 01:38:21,690
us that are born with
certain abilities better off,

1659
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,750
which then leads to those
environments being created even more.

1660
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,340
Let me give you some,
an example of that.

1661
01:38:26,341 --> 01:38:30,030
The most famous example of this is
something known as lactase persistence.

1662
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:34,470
So many people, not about half the
world can adults can drink milk.

1663
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:39,090
The other half cannot. They
get lactose intolerant. Well,

1664
01:38:39,091 --> 01:38:42,900
why can you drink milk as an adult? Have
you ever thought about that? Like why?

1665
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:46,770
Why are you capable of drinking milk
as an adult? In our ancestral state,

1666
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,870
actually up until about 10,000 years ago,

1667
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:52,770
only babies could address to digest
milk because only babies had milk.

1668
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,710
Babies would suckle at their mother's
breasts and have milk and then they'd be

1669
01:38:55,711 --> 01:38:59,610
weaned and then they would never drink
milk again. There'd be no milk to drink.

1670
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:03,990
There was therefore no reason for any
adult to be able to digest lactose,

1671
01:39:03,991 --> 01:39:08,490
which is the principle sugar in milk
because there was no lactose in your diet.

1672
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,690
You didn't encounter milk,

1673
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:13,140
so human beings were able to digest
lactose when they were babies.

1674
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:15,480
They lost that capacity.
All human beings,

1675
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,300
when they got to about two or three
or four or five, when they wean,

1676
01:39:18,301 --> 01:39:20,790
they no longer were able to just melt.
So the enzymes in their body,

1677
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:23,610
we're programmed as it were to
only work when they were infants.

1678
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:30,140
Well about between three and 9,000 years
ago in multiple places in Africa and in

1679
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:33,480
Europe,
human beings suddenly domesticate animals.

1680
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,610
We domesticate milk producing animals like
cattle and sheep and goats and camels,

1681
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,870
and now all of a sudden there's a
supply of milk around us because of our

1682
01:39:42,871 --> 01:39:45,360
cultural innovation,
because of the thing we invented,

1683
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:50,070
we created the domestic breeds.
Now we have milk.

1684
01:39:50,071 --> 01:39:54,300
Now therefore those among us who are
mutants who were born with the ability to

1685
01:39:54,301 --> 01:39:59,010
have our lactase, the enzyme that
digest lactose persist into adulthood.

1686
01:39:59,011 --> 01:40:00,750
This is known as lactase persistence.

1687
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:05,790
Those of us who had that would have a
survival advantage because we could have

1688
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,730
another source of calories that the
rest of the people in our group couldn't

1689
01:40:08,731 --> 01:40:09,241
consume.

1690
01:40:09,241 --> 01:40:13,290
They couldn't drink milk like we could
and we had a source of unspoiled water

1691
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,570
during times of drought.
We could drink milk.

1692
01:40:15,571 --> 01:40:18,630
Everyone else had to drink this filthy
water that they didn't have access to,

1693
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:22,800
so those among us who had these qualities
could reproduce better, survive headed,

1694
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:26,730
have survival advantage. It turns out
that this has happened several times.

1695
01:40:26,731 --> 01:40:27,870
This is when well documented.

1696
01:40:27,871 --> 01:40:30,450
The genetics of this has all been worked
out several times and last three to

1697
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:34,350
9,000 years because of Acumen,
cultural product.

1698
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:40,130
We have evolved to be a slightly different
genetically and it doesn't stop with

1699
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:41,303
cows.

1700
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:47,120
I think that when we invent
cities about over 5,000 years ago,

1701
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:50,490
we, so we, we, we invent
agriculture about 10,000 years ago.

1702
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:52,230
It's debated exactly
when we invent cities,

1703
01:40:52,231 --> 01:40:54,940
but between five and 10,000 years ago
we start having fixed settlements.

1704
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:57,850
Earlier you and I were talking about
population density and having to live with

1705
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:01,660
other people, which is not our ancestral
state, not packed, not with other people.

1706
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:05,710
We always lived as a group, as socially.
I think that as we invent cities,

1707
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:09,730
people with different kinds of brains
are better able to survive in cities.

1708
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:14,470
So now that we've invented cities where
advantaging people with certain kinds of

1709
01:41:14,471 --> 01:41:18,490
brains and therefore I think in a
thousand or 2000 or 5,000 years,

1710
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:19,960
just like the milk example,

1711
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:24,280
there'll be different people as a result
of something we humans manufactured

1712
01:41:24,281 --> 01:41:28,810
that we made. And I could keep giving you
examples of this. There's a, in the book,

1713
01:41:28,811 --> 01:41:32,350
I have an example, another example of
a, they're called the sea nomads. They,

1714
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:36,880
they live in the Philippines.
These are people who don't live on land.

1715
01:41:36,881 --> 01:41:40,330
They live on houseboats that sail around
the Pacific for thousands of years.

1716
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:43,960
They've had this lifestyle and
they die for their food dive.

1717
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:48,250
So they forage on the seabed.
They are the world's best free divers.

1718
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:50,650
They spend hours per day underwater.

1719
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:54,700
They can hold their breath longer than
anyone else. Uh, and they, they do do it.

1720
01:41:54,701 --> 01:41:57,340
Nothing except with
weights and wooden goggles.

1721
01:41:57,580 --> 01:42:00,400
They dive down into the seabed
and forage and they hunt.

1722
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:04,180
They hunt underwater with spears.
Okay.

1723
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:08,650
They hunt underwater would spirits.
It's mind boggling. Wow. And uh,

1724
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:11,380
but they, uh, have evolved,

1725
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:16,180
have different spleens and
different oxygen metabolism
than you and I. So those,

1726
01:42:16,181 --> 01:42:21,100
among them that could survive the dives,
fed their families, made more babies.

1727
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:24,700
And now we think this happened 2000
years ago. There are different,

1728
01:42:24,701 --> 01:42:26,980
the ones that couldn't died.

1729
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:30,520
So their invention of a
seafaring way of life,

1730
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,470
their invention of a way of living at sea,
the boats technology,

1731
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:38,140
the,
the spear fishing technology,

1732
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:41,890
the intervention of those
technologies creates an environment,

1733
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,840
cultural environment around them,

1734
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:48,790
which modifies natural
selection and changes the kind
of genes that those people

1735
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:49,624
have.
These are,

1736
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,510
these are discussed in blueprint and
there are many examples of how I want to

1737
01:42:52,511 --> 01:42:57,190
see an image of these
goggles. Yeah. If you Google,

1738
01:42:57,610 --> 01:43:00,520
if you Google, um, that's
our little slit goggles.

1739
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:05,050
If you Google see nomad Goggle, you may
come up with it and let me give you,

1740
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:09,790
what are they using for a lens? There's
no lens. Yeah, they're little slits.

1741
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:14,110
So what's the point? Uh, I didn't
look at the technology at that level,

1742
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:18,010
but let me just find lens than it
doesn't protect your eyes. I think it,

1743
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:21,580
I think it, uh, it may reduce
glare underwater, you know,

1744
01:43:21,581 --> 01:43:26,470
by having you look through slits, it's
got some something on, I can see it,

1745
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,850
Huh? Uh, well, no,

1746
01:43:27,851 --> 01:43:30,520
because they didn't have glass or maybe
they might take a piece of it. Well,

1747
01:43:30,521 --> 01:43:32,620
the one this kids holding up,
it's got something. Let me see.

1748
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:40,060
That's a lots of actual, no,
that's a modern scuba diving mask.

1749
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:44,150
Yeah. He may have made it from wood, but
the ancient one. Yeah. This is the Zhao.

1750
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:47,370
But uh, so if you look
at, so look at that.

1751
01:43:47,371 --> 01:43:50,740
Can you find what's I'm looking Goggle,
I mean it'll be hard to find.

1752
01:43:50,741 --> 01:43:53,960
Maybe no one's put it on and now of
course they have modern technology so they

1753
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:58,220
can uh, they can, uh, that's, those
are totally monitored plastic. Yes.

1754
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:01,340
But they used to have these
wooden goggles anyway.

1755
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:06,350
They adopted or adapted
rather to this new lifestyle.

1756
01:44:06,351 --> 01:44:08,730
Sort of like genetically adapt.
Yes.

1757
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:13,780
Like the [inaudible] have developed
disability to not get frostbite and to not

1758
01:44:14,421 --> 01:44:17,390
get numb fingers and cold weather.
I did not know that example,

1759
01:44:17,391 --> 01:44:20,660
but that would be an example of that.
Yeah. This is an example from a,

1760
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:23,810
believe they were talking
about it from Alaska that they,

1761
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:28,190
they did genetic testing on these people
and they did different facets. Yes, yes,

1762
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:31,850
yes, yes, yes. That would be another
example of just exactly that example.

1763
01:44:31,851 --> 01:44:35,150
I didn't put that one in the
book, but yes. Yeah, we're
incredibly flexible, right?

1764
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:38,990
Yes. Well we have flex two kinds
of flexibility, so, so think about,

1765
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:42,710
think about like when we settled the
Tibetan plateau, when human being settled,

1766
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:46,130
the Tibetan plateau,
there were different challenges up there.

1767
01:44:46,131 --> 01:44:50,630
It's cold up there and there's not a
lot of oxygen up there. Now we could,

1768
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:54,140
genetic evolution is not fast in us.
We didn't become furry, you know,

1769
01:44:54,141 --> 01:44:58,940
like one way to cope with a cold is to
become furry again. We didn't do that.

1770
01:44:58,941 --> 01:45:00,500
Why?
Because we had clothing.

1771
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:04,160
We had cultural means of
coping with this situation.

1772
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:08,600
So for the coal to cope with a cold,
we used culture.

1773
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:12,890
There was no cultural means to
cope with the low oxygen up there.

1774
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,770
They didn't have bottled
oxygen 5,000 years ago.

1775
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:17,810
There was no way to produce oxygen.
They couldn't,

1776
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,640
they didn't have the
chemistry to produce auction.

1777
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:23,780
So the auction to cope with the
low oxygen tent pressure up there,

1778
01:45:23,781 --> 01:45:24,980
low oxygen tension up there.

1779
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:29,420
They've evolved genetically so that the
people who live in the, in the Himalayas,

1780
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,750
they actually have different kinds
of hemoglobin compared to you and me,

1781
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,660
better able to extract
oxygen from the environment.

1782
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:39,020
So they're two different challenges
that are coped with in different ways.

1783
01:45:39,021 --> 01:45:43,160
One is cope with culturally by cultural
evolution. One is coped with genetically,

1784
01:45:43,161 --> 01:45:44,300
which is much slower,

1785
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:49,580
which genetic evolution and it's the
cultural evolution is the cultural traits

1786
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:51,013
that natural.

1787
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:54,710
So natural selection equips us with a
capacity to accumulate knowledge and to

1788
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:58,850
teach each other stuff.
And given that rare ability,

1789
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:00,410
as we discussed earlier,

1790
01:46:00,411 --> 01:46:03,620
we're able to spread out across the
planet and live in all these dissimilar

1791
01:46:03,621 --> 01:46:08,570
environments. We use our cultural
ability to dominate the planet basically.

1792
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:11,900
Now, when you were, when
you were creating this,

1793
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:17,180
will you actually thinking of it as a
blueprint that someone would follow?

1794
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:23,660
Uh, yes and no. I wasn't thinking of it
that way, but having finished the book,

1795
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:26,450
I do think that there are,
like I don't,

1796
01:46:26,451 --> 01:46:29,960
in the book I talk a little bit in
the book about implications for, uh,

1797
01:46:29,961 --> 01:46:34,880
of these ideas for, for
artificial intelligence.
Like, as we create robots, uh,

1798
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:39,240
as we, even as we create sex robots
or autonomous vehicles or, uh,

1799
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,090
forms of bots online,

1800
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:44,810
how should those bots be programs
so as not to injure our society.

1801
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:48,440
So there are some policy implications
I discuss in the book, but I,

1802
01:46:48,441 --> 01:46:52,620
I wasn't thinking of this as a,
as a, as a, as a a prescription.

1803
01:46:52,621 --> 01:46:56,700
Like this is the way to live a good life.
But partly because as I,

1804
01:46:56,701 --> 01:46:58,590
as I argue in the book,
you know,

1805
01:46:58,591 --> 01:47:02,070
we don't need to affirmatively
seek a good life.

1806
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:06,420
We have been endowed by natural selection
with the capacity to make a good life,

1807
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:10,080
uh, full of these qualities.
So this blueprint is,

1808
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:13,650
I want to use the word God given it
doesn't come from God, but it's God given,

1809
01:47:13,651 --> 01:47:17,490
you know, it comes from somewhere else.
It comes from natural selection that we,

1810
01:47:17,491 --> 01:47:20,250
um, that we do this. So I, yeah.

1811
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:23,950
How much time have you put into
artificial intelligence and a lot,

1812
01:47:23,951 --> 01:47:27,780
and we do a lot of work in my lab on Ai.
What about sex robots?

1813
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:30,330
Like what rules should
they give for sex robots?

1814
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:33,690
And how much could that damage
interpersonal relations? Yes,

1815
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:37,230
that's a great question. That's
exactly the right question in my view.

1816
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:42,590
So our concern with sex robots from a
liberty point of view should not in the

1817
01:47:43,201 --> 01:47:45,570
slightest. B, whether
you enjoy a sex robot,

1818
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:51,060
it's your business you'd buyer bought,
do what you want. I really don't. I see.

1819
01:47:51,061 --> 01:47:56,000
I find it would be hard pressed
to to object. The problem
is with set. Well let's,

1820
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,210
let's back up from the less provocative,

1821
01:47:57,211 --> 01:47:59,670
but let's come back at six but I looked
like a simpler example. First let's talk.

1822
01:47:59,671 --> 01:48:02,890
Let's talk about your children
talking to Alexa. Okay,

1823
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:06,960
so the person who designs Alexa wants
to make your child's experience easy and

1824
01:48:06,961 --> 01:48:11,400
pleasant and as part of the programming
of Alexa because they want to make Alexa

1825
01:48:11,401 --> 01:48:14,910
the obedient servant of your child,
it doesn't require a child to say,

1826
01:48:14,911 --> 01:48:17,610
please Alexa,
would you play the music for me?

1827
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:20,460
Your child can be as rude as she wants to.

1828
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:24,030
Alexa and Alexa will do what she wants.
What you should be concerned about,

1829
01:48:24,031 --> 01:48:26,640
however, is not your child's
interaction with Alexa.

1830
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:29,460
When you should be concerned about
is what your child is learning from

1831
01:48:29,461 --> 01:48:31,980
interacting with Alexa,
that then she takes to the playground.

1832
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:33,930
So now she's rude to other children.

1833
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:38,100
So Alexa is corroding our social fabric.
Alexa,

1834
01:48:38,101 --> 01:48:41,070
in this example is making
children rude to each other.

1835
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:46,470
So our concern is not so much
do we make and do we make,

1836
01:48:46,471 --> 01:48:49,130
you know, like Asimov's
laws of robotics, do we we,

1837
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:52,620
it's not that we want to program the
robot so that their don't harm you.

1838
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:54,450
It's true.
The first law,

1839
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:58,430
we don't want the robot to through an act
of commission or omission harmer allow

1840
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,670
human to come to be harmed.

1841
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:03,600
It's that we're concerned about how the
robot and interacting with you might

1842
01:49:03,601 --> 01:49:06,630
cause you to harm others.
The robot,

1843
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:10,590
the robotic intelligence creates these
externalities, these cascade effects.

1844
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,240
So in the Alexa example,

1845
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:17,600
we might want to regulate the programming
of devices that speak to children,

1846
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:21,990
not because we want to
deprive your daughter,

1847
01:49:21,991 --> 01:49:24,390
have the right to speak how she wants,

1848
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:28,230
but because we recognize that that robot
is going to cause your daughter to be

1849
01:49:28,231 --> 01:49:32,520
rude to other people. Is it really?
Do you really think, yes, the Alexa,

1850
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:35,490
what's the weather that that
would make your attorney?

1851
01:49:35,491 --> 01:49:39,420
But surely I think it will contribute. So
that's a, it's an example. It's not like,

1852
01:49:39,421 --> 01:49:41,340
I'm not arguing that Alexis should become,

1853
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:45,480
or nately think it's so novel to kids
that they know it's not a person.

1854
01:49:45,481 --> 01:49:46,530
I don't think it really,
all right.

1855
01:49:46,531 --> 01:49:48,310
But we're using these
examples to build the thing.

1856
01:49:48,311 --> 01:49:49,990
So let's talk about the sex robot.
Okay.

1857
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:55,680
So some people believe that actually
the emergence of sex robots,

1858
01:49:56,231 --> 01:50:00,400
which will surely appear in the
next 10 or 20 years, um, will, um,

1859
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:04,330
will be a fantastic boon.
They think that, um,

1860
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:07,140
you will people be able to experiment,
uh,

1861
01:50:07,150 --> 01:50:10,270
you'll be able to experiment with
same sex relationships. For example,

1862
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:13,540
a group sex. Uh, you might learn to be a,

1863
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:18,250
a better lover so he could practice with
the robots and therefore you'd be more

1864
01:50:18,251 --> 01:50:21,610
experienced when you were having
sex with a real human. So they,

1865
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,780
you can't get venereal diseases from a
sex robots. You can't hurt their feelings.

1866
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:26,310
Uh,

1867
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:30,070
so people think that the argument based
on ethical grounds is that this would be

1868
01:50:30,071 --> 01:50:32,980
terrific. Uh, that this will be a benefit.

1869
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:35,230
Other people have the opposite opinion.

1870
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:39,280
Other people think that actually
having sex with robots first of all is

1871
01:50:39,281 --> 01:50:44,130
symbolically and, and, um, conceptually
vile. They think that, you know, it,

1872
01:50:44,131 --> 01:50:47,830
it, it, it takes sex and converts
it into a kind of a machine,

1873
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:51,020
literally a machine like
a, you know, function. Uh,

1874
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:53,020
and they furthermore think
that it would result in,

1875
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:58,021
you ha in one having a kind of anonymous
or impersonal interactions with human

1876
01:50:58,151 --> 01:51:02,290
subsequently that you'll be in trained,
you know, to let's say want an obedient,

1877
01:51:02,350 --> 01:51:06,370
uh, you know, partner, uh, for
example, I don't have a stand on this.

1878
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:08,860
Like I don't know which way it's going
out. And in a way I don't have to get,

1879
01:51:08,861 --> 01:51:09,671
make a stand on it.

1880
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:13,660
Because what I'm interested in recognizing
is that when we talk about having,

1881
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:16,180
allowing people to have sex with
sex robots not allowing there,

1882
01:51:16,181 --> 01:51:17,014
it's going to happen.

1883
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:21,520
The focus of our concern should be not
what is your experience in your bedroom

1884
01:51:21,521 --> 01:51:26,470
when you have sex with a sex robot?
Our concern is a state like my interest,

1885
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:30,010
I have no stake or control over
what you're doing over there,

1886
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:33,670
but my interest is in,
in once you have had that experience,

1887
01:51:33,671 --> 01:51:36,310
how does that change how you
interact with other people? Right.

1888
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:39,490
And there I think just like
anything else like you can,

1889
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:42,280
you can make all the garbage
you want in your house,

1890
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,030
but if you start polluting the
environment, you're harming me.

1891
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:49,840
So now I have a reason for intervening
in your activities on your land.

1892
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:53,710
You can't pollute your own land if
that pollution runs off onto my land.

1893
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:58,180
And so the similar argument can be
made or look at autonomous vehicles.

1894
01:51:58,181 --> 01:51:59,014
Here's an example.

1895
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:03,280
Right now we have all roads,

1896
01:52:03,281 --> 01:52:08,050
almost all roads have just human drivers
and in 20 or 30 years almost all roads

1897
01:52:08,051 --> 01:52:09,940
will probably have only nonhuman drivers.

1898
01:52:09,941 --> 01:52:14,620
Machines will drive and those autonomous
vehicles probably can be yoked

1899
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:18,180
together. They can communicate with
each other so that you'll have like,

1900
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:21,430
like trains of cars moving and synchrony.

1901
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:24,070
Like each of them will be communicating
with the other nearby cars and you'll

1902
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:28,270
have laminar flow where all these vehicles
are smoothly moving and joining the

1903
01:52:28,271 --> 01:52:31,630
highway and leaving the highway and
communicating on a citywide scale,

1904
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:35,830
slowing traffic down miles away because
they anticipate with AI that there'll be

1905
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:39,910
a jam here if they don't do that. And,
and I think that'll be actually great.

1906
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:41,560
I'm actually looking
forward to autonomous.

1907
01:52:41,561 --> 01:52:44,890
I mean I still like to take my
car to the speedway but you know,

1908
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:47,480
dried it itself with stick,
which I like, but you know,

1909
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:53,030
but in between we're going to have a
world of what I call hybrid systems of

1910
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:58,360
human driven cars and autonomous
vehicles coexisting in an on a plane,

1911
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:00,253
on an even plane.

1912
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:05,210
And we need to be worried about that
because these autonomous vehicles when we

1913
01:53:05,211 --> 01:53:08,030
interact with them are going to change
how we interact with each other.

1914
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:09,800
For example,

1915
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:14,390
do we program the autonomous vehicle
to drive at a constant steady speed?

1916
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:17,330
If you're the designer of
the car, you might say, Gee,

1917
01:53:17,331 --> 01:53:19,520
I don't want this car to crash a,

1918
01:53:19,521 --> 01:53:23,330
I want the car to drive in a very
predictable fashion and that that's what's

1919
01:53:23,331 --> 01:53:24,560
best for the occupants of the car.

1920
01:53:24,561 --> 01:53:26,300
That's what's gonna allow
me to sell more vehicles.

1921
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:32,210
But it may be the case that actually
when people are in contact with such a

1922
01:53:32,211 --> 01:53:35,630
vehicle, they get lulled into
a false sense of security. Oh,

1923
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:37,160
that'd vehicle never does anything new.

1924
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:39,470
I don't need to pay so much
attention to the car in front of me.

1925
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:42,530
I just miss drive, you
know, at a steady clip.

1926
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:46,070
And then they veer off and they go to a
part of the highway where they're just

1927
01:53:46,071 --> 01:53:50,000
human drivers and now having been
lulled into a false sense of security,

1928
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:52,730
they cause more collisions
is not paying attention.

1929
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:57,740
So that autonomous vehicle has changed
how I drive in a way that harms other

1930
01:53:57,741 --> 01:53:58,574
people.

1931
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:03,050
So maybe the programming of the vehicle
should be to occasionally do erratic

1932
01:54:03,051 --> 01:54:06,860
things too. Like suddenly slow
down or speed up a little bit,

1933
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:10,940
obliging me to stay vigilant
and pay attention as I'm
interacting with that car.

1934
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:13,130
So that then when I go to
another part of the highway,

1935
01:54:13,131 --> 01:54:17,510
when I interact with just humans, I have
retained that vigilance. Once again,

1936
01:54:17,511 --> 01:54:18,570
the lesson here is,

1937
01:54:18,571 --> 01:54:22,010
is that it's not just about the one
on one interaction between the robotic

1938
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:24,500
artificial intelligence
and the human being.

1939
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:27,230
It's about how the robot's affect us.
And in my lab,

1940
01:54:27,231 --> 01:54:31,550
we do many experiments in social systems
where we take a group of people and we

1941
01:54:31,551 --> 01:54:32,870
drop online,

1942
01:54:32,871 --> 01:54:37,871
we drop a Bot or in the laboratory we
have a physical robot and we watch how the

1943
01:54:37,911 --> 01:54:42,690
presence of the robot doesn't just
modify how the human interacts with the

1944
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:46,910
robot, but how the humans interact with
each other. So if we put a robot right,

1945
01:54:46,911 --> 01:54:51,650
they're looking at us with its
third, I would, we, uh, you know,

1946
01:54:51,651 --> 01:54:54,860
would it change how you and I talked
to each other, make us different.

1947
01:54:55,310 --> 01:54:57,380
That's the experiments we're doing.
Well,

1948
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:02,300
clearly in the sex robot realm, that's
going to be a problem. I mean we,

1949
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:07,301
we see the difference between
humans that have porn addictions.

1950
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:08,620
Yeah, that's a good example. Yeah.

1951
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:13,040
Porn addictions when people do they
developed is very impersonal way of

1952
01:55:13,041 --> 01:55:14,600
communicating with people and they,

1953
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:18,650
they think about sex and
the objectification of
the opposite sex in a very

1954
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:23,300
different reasons. Very different
way. It flavors the way you,

1955
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:26,510
it flavors your expectations. Yes.
Yes. And it makes it difficult.

1956
01:55:26,511 --> 01:55:30,170
It can make it difficult for you to have
normal sexual relationships if you come

1957
01:55:30,171 --> 01:55:34,890
to see if your expectations are, are, uh,

1958
01:55:35,070 --> 01:55:40,070
guided by porn and that is going to
be radically magnified by some sort of

1959
01:55:41,571 --> 01:55:44,190
artificial life form that you create

1960
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,080
that's indistinguishable. Yes. Have,

1961
01:55:46,081 --> 01:55:50,010
you can have an indistinguishable
sex partner that is, you know,

1962
01:55:50,011 --> 01:55:54,990
some incredibly beautiful woman. Yes.
That is a robot. And then you are,

1963
01:55:54,991 --> 01:55:59,040
man, let's go, man, women would be quite
happy to change their spouses for robots.

1964
01:55:59,430 --> 01:56:03,330
I wonder if women are going to be as
intuit as men because I think women divine

1965
01:56:03,370 --> 01:56:04,710
desire,

1966
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:09,700
more emotional intimacy
and I think, I mean, uh,

1967
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:14,490
on a, on a scale than
men do. I, I think, um,

1968
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:16,930
I think the jury is still
out on, you know, what,

1969
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:21,120
what the relative balance between men
and women, we might be surprised that uh,

1970
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:23,430
that will be repeated nails,

1971
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:27,930
especially given x societal expectations
and women can form those and,

1972
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:31,140
and I'll be giving her a chance
to not a lot of men can be sure.

1973
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:32,640
So it could go both ways.
I don't,

1974
01:56:32,641 --> 01:56:36,030
I'm not prepared to make a prediction
who's going to be better off in the gender

1975
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:39,840
debate with the emergence of sex robots,
but they'll maybe you way you suggest,

1976
01:56:39,841 --> 01:56:43,530
I don't know what we're also in this
weird transition genetically where they're

1977
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:48,470
doing genetic expert experiments on
humans and with the advent of Crispr and

1978
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,790
emerging technologies,
I was talking about that in the book too.

1979
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:54,420
Entirely possible that there's not
going to be any frumpy bodies anymore.

1980
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:59,640
That that's hundreds of years away.
But yes, I think so. I wonder, I mean,

1981
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:00,630
I don't know if it is,

1982
01:57:00,631 --> 01:57:03,720
I think if they start cracking them out
in China and they start giving birth to

1983
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:08,340
eight foot tall superman,
yes. 12 inch dicks. Yes. We're
going to have a real issue.

1984
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:13,320
Yes. Uh, we will, uh, yes,
that's the least of it. Uh, yes.

1985
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:16,190
Uh,
like God,

1986
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:20,070
I mean it's a million tiredly possible
in the future they're going to have that

1987
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:22,500
and then we're going to
have likely cumins yes.

1988
01:57:22,501 --> 01:57:24,960
I think that is likely the
debate is how far in the future.

1989
01:57:24,990 --> 01:57:29,990
So I don't think we're going to start
by using these technologies to cure a

1990
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:34,440
monogenic diseases. So, you know,
like thalassemia for example,

1991
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:36,510
so a diseases or certain
immune deficiencies,

1992
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:40,350
disease where a single
gene is defective and uh,

1993
01:57:40,410 --> 01:57:43,140
and those will be the initial targets.
But once we start with that,

1994
01:57:43,141 --> 01:57:46,740
eventually I think there will be people
who will want to genetically engineer

1995
01:57:46,741 --> 01:57:49,620
other people, uh, their
offspring for example,

1996
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:51,690
and a modified them in
the ways that you suggest,

1997
01:57:51,691 --> 01:57:53,640
maybe not 12 inch Dick's
but maybe you know,

1998
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:56,650
ability to run fast or something
else. Far Smarter. I mean, yes.

1999
01:57:56,651 --> 01:57:59,300
Isn't that one of these side effects
that they showed with the, um,

2000
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:03,880
genetic manipulation of these Chinese
babies to eliminate HIV there?

2001
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:06,540
That they made them smarter? No, I don't
know if they made them smarter there.

2002
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:11,670
What's clear from the most recent findings
I've seen from that case is that a,

2003
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:13,800
unsurprisingly,
as anyone could predict,

2004
01:58:14,190 --> 01:58:18,840
the technology is not good enough to
restrict the mutations to one particular

2005
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:19,890
region of the genome.

2006
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:23,670
So there were other changes in the
genome and these children that occurred

2007
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:25,920
elsewhere rather than the targeted region,

2008
01:58:25,921 --> 01:58:30,840
which was to increase their immunity to
HIV. And we don't know what those are,

2009
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:35,040
but those could kill those kids quickly.
We could make them better in some ways,

2010
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:36,420
we have no way of knowing yet,

2011
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:39,870
but I think the conclusion was that it
increased their intelligence. I don't,

2012
01:58:39,871 --> 01:58:40,330
I think it's,

2013
01:58:40,330 --> 01:58:44,080
I have not seen results and I think it
would be premature find that it would

2014
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:46,770
because every mature to come to that
because they're [inaudible]. Yeah.

2015
01:58:46,850 --> 01:58:50,410
There the problem is also
sensational Click Bait, which is,

2016
01:58:50,411 --> 01:58:51,710
that's what you want to click,
you know,

2017
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:54,550
not just that they did the HIV and they
made them smarter is going to get like

2018
01:58:54,551 --> 01:58:57,880
40% more clicks versus,
yeah,

2019
01:58:57,910 --> 01:59:02,860
wolf 40% yeah. That mean that's,
that's just the nature of humans,

2020
01:59:02,861 --> 01:59:07,360
right? Yes. Um, just declare clear. I
talk about the crisper example in, in uh,

2021
01:59:07,361 --> 01:59:10,690
in blueprint. I actually talk about
these, how these technologies, again,

2022
01:59:10,691 --> 01:59:15,691
my lens on it is how these technologies
are going to change how we interact with

2023
01:59:16,061 --> 01:59:16,420
each other.

2024
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:19,060
And it goes back to the example we were
talking about at the beginning when we

2025
01:59:19,061 --> 01:59:20,290
invented cities.

2026
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:23,110
That was a technology that changed
how we interacted with each other.

2027
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:26,050
So human beings for a very long time,

2028
01:59:26,051 --> 01:59:27,910
they've been inventing
when we invented weapons,

2029
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:30,670
that was a technology that changed
how we interact with each other.

2030
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:33,370
So we have previously
done this kind of thing.

2031
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,920
We've invented a technology that changed
how we interact with each other and I'm

2032
01:59:35,921 --> 01:59:40,210
very interested in in the and discuss
some of those implications. Yeah.

2033
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:42,870
I'm incredibly interested
in this because I,

2034
01:59:42,871 --> 01:59:47,871
I love to study history and I love to
study like how crazy the world was four

2035
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:52,060
thousand five thousand years ago,
a thousand years ago,

2036
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:54,040
what it's going to be like in the future.

2037
01:59:54,041 --> 01:59:57,310
I just think our understanding of the
consequences of our actions are so

2038
01:59:57,311 --> 02:00:01,930
different than anybody has ever had
before. We have just such a, a broader,

2039
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:03,761
first of all,

2040
02:00:03,761 --> 02:00:08,380
we have examples from all over the world
now that we can study very closely,

2041
02:00:08,410 --> 02:00:13,330
which I don't think really was available
to that many people up until recently.

2042
02:00:13,450 --> 02:00:14,530
You mean?
I'm sorry.

2043
02:00:14,531 --> 02:00:17,560
You're saying the examples are more
numerous or a capacity to discern them is

2044
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:22,000
higher. Our capacity to discern them and
just our in depth understanding of these

2045
02:00:22,001 --> 02:00:23,880
various cultures all over the world.
Like,

2046
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:28,240
like what you've been telling you
today about these divers and others,

2047
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:32,710
we just have so much more data and so
much more of an understanding than ever

2048
02:00:32,711 --> 02:00:36,520
before. Yes, I love the idea that we are,

2049
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:41,500
I mean I believe that this is probably
the best time ever to be alive and I

2050
02:00:41,501 --> 02:00:43,120
think that it's probably,
I think that's true.

2051
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:46,600
I think there's certainly
a lot of terrible things
that are wrong in the world

2052
02:00:46,601 --> 02:00:47,440
today also true.

2053
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:52,650
But I think that there's less of that and
more good and compare that too before.

2054
02:00:54,430 --> 02:00:55,510
No, I think that's right. And,

2055
02:00:55,511 --> 02:00:58,900
but one of the arguments that I make is
this is a kind of Steven pinker argument

2056
02:00:58,901 --> 02:01:02,710
that you're outlining, which is, you
know, with the emergence of, I mean,

2057
02:01:02,711 --> 02:01:04,950
people are living longer than they
ever have on the whole planet.

2058
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:09,040
Fewer people in starvation.
We have less violence. I mean,

2059
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:12,740
every indicator of human wellbeing is up.
Uh,

2060
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:17,820
and it's partly due, are largely due in
the recent last thousand years to the, uh,

2061
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:20,920
to the emergence of the
enlightenment and a, the Phyllis,

2062
02:01:20,921 --> 02:01:25,210
the philosophy and the science that was
guided that emerged about 300 years ago

2063
02:01:25,211 --> 02:01:29,530
and 200 and some odd years ago and
culminating in the present and continuing.

2064
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,790
So I think,

2065
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:33,460
I think this is not just the kind of
so-called weekish view of history.

2066
02:01:33,461 --> 02:01:35,530
It's not just a progressive
sort of fantasy.

2067
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:40,910
I think it's the case that
these philosophical and
moves that our species made

2068
02:01:40,911 --> 02:01:44,150
in the last few hundred years has
improved our wellbeing. However,

2069
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:45,800
as we've been discussing today,

2070
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:51,430
it's not just historical forces that are
tending towards making us better off a

2071
02:01:52,551 --> 02:01:56,690
deeper and more ancient and more
powerful force is also at work,

2072
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:58,160
which is natural selection.

2073
02:01:58,190 --> 02:02:02,000
It's evolutionary and not just historical
forces that are relevant to our

2074
02:02:02,001 --> 02:02:02,834
wellbeing.

2075
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:07,520
And we don't just need to
look to philosophers to find
the path to a good life.

2076
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:11,420
Natural selection has equipped us with
these capacities for love and friendship

2077
02:02:11,421 --> 02:02:13,880
and cooperation and teaching and all
these good things we've been discussing

2078
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:18,200
that also tend to a good life. So,
so yes, I totally, we would do,

2079
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:22,790
we're better off today than we've ever
been on average across the world. However,

2080
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:25,550
it's not just that,
that's contributing to our wellbeing.

2081
02:02:26,190 --> 02:02:31,190
This natural selection is literally why
we are in this state now and why we were

2082
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:34,220
hoping this trend will continue.

2083
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:39,110
We will be in this better place 50 years
from now, 100 years from now. Well,

2084
02:02:39,111 --> 02:02:41,150
natural selection doesn't
work over those time scales.

2085
02:02:41,151 --> 02:02:44,870
So those are historical forces. But the
point is we are set up for success. Yes.

2086
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:49,880
Um, you know, we are equipped with these,
uh, you know, you're given five fingers,

2087
02:02:49,881 --> 02:02:53,530
which make it pos and an opposable thumb,
which allows you to manipulate tools.

2088
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:56,060
So natural selection has
given you an opposable thumb.

2089
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:58,070
Culture lets you use a computer.

2090
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:02,630
Do you worry about the circumventing
of this natural process by artificial

2091
02:03:02,631 --> 02:03:06,860
intelligence that artificial intelligence
is going to introduce some new,

2092
02:03:06,861 --> 02:03:11,861
incredibly powerful factor into this
whole chain of events that by having sex

2093
02:03:13,311 --> 02:03:18,020
robots and sex or, or,
or, or, um, robot workers,

2094
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:22,910
yes. Things becoming automated.
Yes. This I, I'm concerned. I mean,

2095
02:03:22,911 --> 02:03:23,744
this is,
I,

2096
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:29,210
I'm very concerned about how technology
is going to affect our economy. These,

2097
02:03:29,211 --> 02:03:31,940
again, these concerns were not the
first generation to face these concerns.

2098
02:03:31,941 --> 02:03:34,790
There were similar concerns with the
industrial revolution that workers were

2099
02:03:34,791 --> 02:03:38,750
being put out of work when machines were
invented. Nevertheless, work persisted.

2100
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:42,920
People still had jobs to do. Um, there was
a disruption. There's no doubt about it.

2101
02:03:42,921 --> 02:03:47,330
I think Google and the information
revolution and these types of robotic

2102
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:49,220
automation are disruptive.

2103
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:54,250
They're going to affect how we allocate
labor and capital and data in our

2104
02:03:55,101 --> 02:03:56,660
society.
There's no doubt about all of that.

2105
02:03:57,140 --> 02:04:00,380
I thought you were alluding to just
to check if you were to the debate,

2106
02:04:00,381 --> 02:04:03,740
which I don't know the
answer to on whether AI will,

2107
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:06,740
are we going to face like a terminator
type existence where you know the

2108
02:04:06,741 --> 02:04:11,741
machine's rise up and kill us all or not
and you know very smart people on both

2109
02:04:12,051 --> 02:04:16,460
sides of that debate. And I read them
all and like I would like, he's right.

2110
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,820
And then there'd be the guy
that has the opposite, but
I'm like, no, no, he's right.

2111
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:21,140
And then it goes back and forth.

2112
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:25,250
I don't know who's writing it goes back
to nuance, right? Yes, it is nuanced,

2113
02:04:25,251 --> 02:04:28,730
but it's hard to know whether, again,
we're not talking over our lifetimes,

2114
02:04:28,731 --> 02:04:30,800
right over hundreds of years,
you know?

2115
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:33,740
Is there a time a thousand years from
now when the human beings will say,

2116
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:36,770
what the hell were our ancestors doing
inventing artificial intelligence that

2117
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:40,620
they're wiping us out?
I don't know the answer to that question.

2118
02:04:40,621 --> 02:04:44,820
I think there's an issue also with the,
the concept of artificial,

2119
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:47,760
like artificial life,
artificial intelligence. It's,

2120
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:51,720
I think it's going to be life because
it's is going to be a life that we've

2121
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:53,850
created.
And I don't think it's artificial.

2122
02:04:53,851 --> 02:04:55,710
I just think it's a
different kind of life.

2123
02:04:55,740 --> 02:05:00,240
I think that we're thinking of
biologically based life of sex

2124
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:07,560
reproduction in terms of the way we've
always known it as being the only way

2125
02:05:07,561 --> 02:05:08,460
that life exists.

2126
02:05:08,461 --> 02:05:13,230
But if we can create something and
that something decides to do things,

2127
02:05:13,231 --> 02:05:16,940
it's sound create, live on its own.
Yeah. It's silicon based life form.

2128
02:05:16,970 --> 02:05:18,120
Like why not?
Why,

2129
02:05:18,121 --> 02:05:22,260
why does life have to be something
that only exists through the, you know,

2130
02:05:22,261 --> 02:05:27,000
multiplication of cells. Yes. That's
very charitable of you. And uh,

2131
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:30,570
it's, people make that claim. Uh,
some people think that, you know,

2132
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:32,250
those machines in the distant future,

2133
02:05:32,251 --> 02:05:36,720
we'll look back at us as like one stage
of evolution that culminated in them

2134
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:42,240
that we're some, I've always said that
we are some sort of an electronic, uh,

2135
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:45,780
Caterpillar that doesn't know that it's
going to give birth to a butterfly.

2136
02:05:45,860 --> 02:05:48,090
We're making a cocoon.
We don't even know what it's doing.

2137
02:05:48,270 --> 02:05:49,500
That's a great metaphor.

2138
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:53,790
I have a hard time accepting that
because you're a person. Yes, it's,

2139
02:05:53,791 --> 02:05:55,830
it gets my interest,
but we're so flawed.

2140
02:05:55,831 --> 02:05:58,160
All these things that we've
outlined all the pipes with us,

2141
02:05:58,170 --> 02:05:59,910
those would go away with
artificial intelligence.

2142
02:05:59,911 --> 02:06:01,700
It's a deep philosophical question,
Joe.

2143
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:05,010
I would think it's inevitable and I
think if the single celled organisms are

2144
02:06:05,011 --> 02:06:07,080
sitting around wondering what
the future was going to be like,

2145
02:06:07,350 --> 02:06:10,840
where are we going to be replaced? Will
they make antibiotics and kill us? Yes.

2146
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:13,740
What's gas? They aren't going
to kill us. I mean this is,

2147
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:16,530
I mean we are so fluff
denigrate the ocean.

2148
02:06:16,531 --> 02:06:20,670
We do pull the fish out of it and do
fuck up the air, do commit genocide.

2149
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:22,140
There's all these things that are real,

2150
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:25,500
but the artificial life won't have
those problems because it won't be

2151
02:06:25,501 --> 02:06:29,520
emotionally based, won't be
biologically based. It'll just exist.

2152
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:35,050
That's a really good story.
We're so flawed. Why not?

2153
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:40,290
Oh, we're very flawed. We are flawed, but
like I said, we have a fun activity at it.

2154
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:43,130
I'm not going to read a very flat though.
We are fly. I think it's beautiful.

2155
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:45,810
Beautiful too. But I think vultures
probably think they're beautiful too.

2156
02:06:45,811 --> 02:06:48,000
That's why they breed with each
other. Well, they are beautiful, but,

2157
02:06:48,030 --> 02:06:50,160
but the point is I think we
have a flop beauty. I like,

2158
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:54,330
I'm going to stick to my principles
that we are, despite our flaws worth it.

2159
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:56,130
There is something wonderful about us.

2160
02:06:56,131 --> 02:07:01,131
And I think that that wonderful creative
quality is the reason why we created

2161
02:07:01,291 --> 02:07:06,120
artificial life in the first place.
It's like this, this creation.

2162
02:07:06,150 --> 02:07:09,450
We've had that impetus. You know,
if you look at a lot of the, um,

2163
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:13,650
the art, whether it's the
Egyptian, you know, the, the, the,

2164
02:07:13,651 --> 02:07:17,580
the pyramids a or other kinds
of, um, artistic expression,

2165
02:07:17,581 --> 02:07:20,910
we seem to have had a desire
to transcend death, you know,

2166
02:07:20,911 --> 02:07:25,911
to make things that sure that looked like
us but weren't alive forever actually.

2167
02:07:26,821 --> 02:07:30,840
So, I mean, I think in that regard,
I think you're quite right that, um,

2168
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:34,550
it's not going to stop. That tendency is
not gonna stop now. You're, you're very,

2169
02:07:34,551 --> 02:07:35,384
as I said,

2170
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:41,370
positive take on the claim and your
analogy to single celled organisms,

2171
02:07:42,161 --> 02:07:44,650
which are just, you know, but a fleeting,
not a fleeting, they're still there,

2172
02:07:44,651 --> 02:07:47,200
but a phase in our evolution,
you know,

2173
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:49,870
is something I'm going to have to be
thinking about because it's disturbing,

2174
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:51,970
honestly. Well, it's an
objective perspective.

2175
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,550
If I took myself out of the human race,
which I really can't,

2176
02:07:54,551 --> 02:07:58,810
but if I tried to fake it, I would say,
oh, I see what's going on here. Yeah.

2177
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:00,010
These domains is,
yes,

2178
02:08:00,011 --> 02:08:03,680
these dummies are buying iPhones
and new Mac books because they,

2179
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:08,320
they know that this is what's going
to help the production of newer,

2180
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:13,060
more superior technologies. The
more we consume. It's also based,

2181
02:08:13,061 --> 02:08:18,061
I think in a lot of ways our insane
desire for materialism is fueling this and

2182
02:08:19,901 --> 02:08:24,820
it could be an inherent property of the
human species that it is designed to

2183
02:08:24,821 --> 02:08:29,050
create this artificial life and that
literally is what it's here for.

2184
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:33,550
And much like an ant is creating an ant
hill and doesn't exactly have some sort

2185
02:08:33,551 --> 02:08:34,570
of a future plan.

2186
02:08:34,730 --> 02:08:39,610
It's kids and it's four o one k plan that
what we're doing is like this inherent

2187
02:08:39,611 --> 02:08:44,250
property of being a human being, our
curiosity, our wanderlust, our design,

2188
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:45,610
our culture things.
Yeah.

2189
02:08:45,611 --> 02:08:50,611
All these things are built in because
if you follow them far enough down the

2190
02:08:50,981 --> 02:08:55,210
line a hundred years, 200 years, it
inevitably leads to artificial life. Yes.

2191
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:59,020
I think, uh, I think that's possible. Um,

2192
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:02,260
and of course we're not going
to be alive to test that idea.

2193
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:07,160
Their son will maybe with CRISPR and
all this crazy shit that's coming down.

2194
02:09:07,170 --> 02:09:10,600
I'll come on. I know there's nothing's
gonna happen in the pace of innovation.

2195
02:09:10,601 --> 02:09:13,180
People always had been say,
if you go back every decade,

2196
02:09:13,181 --> 02:09:14,950
people say just around the corner,
just around the corner,

2197
02:09:14,951 --> 02:09:16,600
these things that are take forever.
They're very hard.

2198
02:09:16,601 --> 02:09:20,110
Biological systems are very hard to
engineer. Um, I don't, and you know,

2199
02:09:20,111 --> 02:09:22,960
of course the people who do
that kind of work will often,

2200
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:26,140
I think a lot of them engage in snake
oil. You know, they want to fund.

2201
02:09:26,141 --> 02:09:26,800
There was sure,

2202
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:30,010
but I think it's entirely possible that
there's a 20 year old listening to this

2203
02:09:30,011 --> 02:09:33,670
podcast will be 150 yes. That's
possible. Maybe a lot more than that.

2204
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:37,280
I think there's, I think it's entirely
possible that 30 year olds today,

2205
02:09:37,281 --> 02:09:41,770
it could be 150, but I think there's,
you give another 10 years of research,

2206
02:09:41,771 --> 02:09:45,040
you give maybe 10 years more.
I think it's entirely, well,

2207
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:49,120
there's a famous bad about this. You may
know they feel Schonski I'll stood bet.

2208
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:53,140
Yes. Where they bet that uh,
about 10 or 20 years ago,

2209
02:09:53,141 --> 02:09:57,220
they bet that there was a person born
that then that year who would live to be

2210
02:09:57,221 --> 02:10:01,300
150. And on one side you had one
guy who said no, they, they, they,

2211
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:05,410
they bet $1 billion and
they endowed it with, uh,

2212
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:08,170
they opened up a bank account.
They put in, you know,

2213
02:10:08,171 --> 02:10:10,300
they're using compound interest
to get to that sum of money.

2214
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:14,850
And they obliged can nerds. Yes. And
they obliged and they have lives.

2215
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:18,190
They're a clear bag.
Yeah. And they, and they,

2216
02:10:18,191 --> 02:10:21,940
and they designated the National Academy
of Sciences or some entity like that,

2217
02:10:21,941 --> 02:10:26,830
that would, um, that would
adjudicate the baton 150 years. And,

2218
02:10:26,831 --> 02:10:27,261
uh,
and they,

2219
02:10:27,261 --> 02:10:30,760
they specify the kinds of documentation
that might be needed and they allowed

2220
02:10:30,761 --> 02:10:34,100
for in the future. They may be other
ways of ascertaining how old someone

2221
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:37,790
is and those can be used.
And that's the bet. Uh, so I,

2222
02:10:37,791 --> 02:10:39,530
you might be right about
that. Like, you know,

2223
02:10:39,531 --> 02:10:43,700
there are humans that live naturally to
be 120. We have that capacity. Actually,

2224
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:46,430
here's an interesting idea.
Why do we die at all?

2225
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:49,730
Why is natural selection ever
given us an immortal species?

2226
02:10:49,731 --> 02:10:53,570
Have you ever thought
about that? Yeah. Yeah.

2227
02:10:54,010 --> 02:10:58,760
I have never reached a conclusion, but
I, I was figured you live long enough.

2228
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,610
We'll, especially up until recent
history, only long enough to recognize it.

2229
02:11:03,611 --> 02:11:04,940
It was all crazy hustle.

2230
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:11,210
That's a fourth philosophical, I'm
looking for a scientific answer. Here's,

2231
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:15,200
here's one answer for why we're not
immortal. So if you think about it,

2232
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:19,010
why would natural selection not have
created a creature that lived forever,

2233
02:11:19,070 --> 02:11:23,810
right? Would that be? Why did, why should
we die? Okay, so here's the one answer.

2234
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:26,750
It's not know for sure if this is the
answer, but this is a good answer.

2235
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:30,140
Imagine there to two different
kinds of things that can kill you.

2236
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:33,380
Intrinsic Causes,
an extrinsic causes,

2237
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:37,400
so things inside your body that
result in you dying, defects,

2238
02:11:37,401 --> 02:11:41,360
diseases and so forth, or things
outside your body, like accidents,

2239
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:44,840
lightening strikes, trees fall,
and you just die and so forth

2240
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:50,900
because it's impossible to eliminate
all extrinsic causes because some people

2241
02:11:50,901 --> 02:11:52,820
are going to die from accidents.

2242
02:11:53,450 --> 02:11:57,410
It would be inefficient from the
point of view of evolution to evolve,

2243
02:11:57,411 --> 02:12:01,240
to be immortal because we would have
all this capacity to be immortal.

2244
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:03,680
We would have these body's
capable of a mortality,

2245
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:05,930
which let's say would be
evolutionarily demanding,

2246
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:10,790
like to evolve anything like
an I or a brain or strong,
any, any quality. Lactase,

2247
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:12,980
right? We, like we talked
about earlier, you,

2248
02:12:13,220 --> 02:12:17,090
you don't have lactase persistence
into adulthood because it's not needed.

2249
02:12:17,091 --> 02:12:19,670
So evolution doesn't waste anything.
There'd be no reason for that.

2250
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:23,770
So there'd be no that would
be there would uh, there, uh,

2251
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:28,790
there would be no reason the argument
goes to evolve in mortality because

2252
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:34,090
inevitably some people would be
killed eventually by accidents anyway.

2253
02:12:34,970 --> 02:12:37,610
So unless you can create a world
in which there are no accidents,

2254
02:12:37,611 --> 02:12:39,740
there are no extrinsic causes of death,

2255
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:44,300
it would be inefficient from an
evolutionary point of view to evolve in

2256
02:12:44,301 --> 02:12:47,390
mortality. So death, the
reason we die naturally,

2257
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:53,590
some people think is that the reason we
dynamically is that there are unnatural

2258
02:12:54,711 --> 02:12:58,070
causes of death in the world,
like accidents.

2259
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:02,960
If we could eliminate the unnatural
causes so that nowhere, no,

2260
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:07,990
no time ever where we ever killed by
trees falling or lightening strikes or

2261
02:13:08,300 --> 02:13:09,380
things like that,

2262
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:14,780
then actually over time we would
evolve to live indefinitely.

2263
02:13:15,110 --> 02:13:19,550
This is the theory. It's
crazy idea. It is fascinating.

2264
02:13:19,551 --> 02:13:22,160
But do you think that nature had
that sort of sort of foresight?

2265
02:13:22,190 --> 02:13:24,650
He was not a foresight,
but that's how natural selection works.

2266
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:29,510
Think about like if I suddenly magically
transformed your body at great expense

2267
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:31,530
to make you capable of immortality.

2268
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:36,240
And then two days from now you're hit
by a bus. I've wasted all that effort.

2269
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:38,850
But if you only done it to one person,
you wasted that effort.

2270
02:13:38,851 --> 02:13:40,230
If you did did it to other people,

2271
02:13:40,231 --> 02:13:44,490
you have the potential to
create an incredibly wise
person with a thousand years

2272
02:13:44,491 --> 02:13:49,150
of life and experience and education die.
He also had die.

2273
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:52,480
So everyone eventually would die from
these extrinsic causes. So personal law,

2274
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:54,990
well, no, that's, that's, that's
their assumption in the model.

2275
02:13:55,360 --> 02:13:58,220
If it's not perhaps if in
fact there are no extremes,

2276
02:13:58,260 --> 02:14:00,960
if in fact there is a world in which
you're never struck by lightning,

2277
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:05,010
never hit by a bus, never
a tree branch, then uh,

2278
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,430
then the theory is that we would
have evolved to be a mortal.

2279
02:14:07,431 --> 02:14:10,110
So it's almost like the law,
the life that you live,

2280
02:14:10,111 --> 02:14:13,290
you're inevitably going to get
killed by extrinsic causes. Yes.

2281
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:16,910
If you extend that life to a thousand
years and it's absolutely going to happen,

2282
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:20,910
therefore why bother?
That's just living in a bubble.

2283
02:14:20,911 --> 02:14:24,930
Just terrified of the world on
rocks. Lamberg and gentry. Yeah,

2284
02:14:24,931 --> 02:14:27,240
but you can't transport,
you can't take this theory.

2285
02:14:27,241 --> 02:14:30,150
And this model and apply to an
individual and an individual life.

2286
02:14:30,151 --> 02:14:33,330
It's about how our species evolved. It's
not about how you should live your life.

2287
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:37,980
I mean it's also true. I don't think
you should live your life afraid.

2288
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:41,460
I think that's a difficult, I think
that's a sad life. To live a life afraid.

2289
02:14:41,461 --> 02:14:43,320
It takes practice to be unafraid of,

2290
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:46,650
you'd be more afraid if you could live
a thousand years without an accident.

2291
02:14:47,510 --> 02:14:49,740
You know? Cause if like if you're
one of those crazy rock climber,

2292
02:14:49,741 --> 02:14:54,650
dude's like Alex Honnold and he's crazy.
He's crazy. I love him though. He's told,

2293
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:56,910
have you talked? Have you met him?
Yeah, I've had him on a couple of times.

2294
02:14:56,940 --> 02:15:00,930
Oh my God, he's awesome. I'm sure he
has his Amygdala. Of course he's a,

2295
02:15:00,931 --> 02:15:04,470
Migdal is fucked up. You know this, right?
He has no fear. Now he does have fear.

2296
02:15:04,471 --> 02:15:06,600
You're wrong. Oh really?
Absolutely. As fear.

2297
02:15:06,630 --> 02:15:10,160
He just understands his capacity
and his ability you think is rashly,

2298
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:11,040
says I can do this,

2299
02:15:11,041 --> 02:15:14,250
therefore I should not be afraid cause
I read that he takes scanned his brain

2300
02:15:14,251 --> 02:15:17,820
and that his, his fear
centers are different than
the rest of us is what I read.

2301
02:15:17,821 --> 02:15:18,810
Maybe that's wrong.
I don't know.

2302
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:21,180
Did he tell you he didn't
say anything about that? No,

2303
02:15:21,181 --> 02:15:23,880
I think he's using his patient.
I don't know about that.

2304
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:27,570
He said basically that the experience,

2305
02:15:27,571 --> 02:15:32,310
he just stays mellow and calm and then
if things go wrong it's really bad.

2306
02:15:32,660 --> 02:15:37,020
Like you don't want to be freaking
out. Yes. It's so diverse.

2307
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:40,470
You don't panic when you're underwater
and you lose your way. Right.

2308
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:44,520
There was a consumes oxygen a lot mazing
story that my friend Donald Cerrone,

2309
02:15:44,521 --> 02:15:49,521
he's a UFC fighter told
about being trapped in a cave
and despegar watering out

2310
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:54,950
when it was running out of oxygen.
Yeah. Horrible, crazy scary story.

2311
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:57,150
And you have to, those guys are
also different. Either they,

2312
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:59,730
either they're born that way
or they learn to be that way.

2313
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,300
You have to keep calm because when
you and I lose our cool and start

2314
02:16:03,301 --> 02:16:06,450
hyperventilating,
our auction consumption skyrockets.

2315
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:09,300
And that's the opposite of what
you need to do in that situation.

2316
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:11,580
Actually what he talked about,
you know,

2317
02:16:11,581 --> 02:16:16,050
like trying to stay calm and battling
the demons not going to die like this.

2318
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:19,830
Yeah. What an incredible story. Yeah.

2319
02:16:19,950 --> 02:16:23,040
The Alex Honnold thing I hear is
something, I watched the movie,

2320
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:26,460
what it talks to him. He got an MRI and
they said that, what did it say? Yeah,

2321
02:16:26,461 --> 02:16:28,500
he's a, Migdal is different,
but what did it say?

2322
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:32,680
How does it say the kids
Amygdala isn't firing. Yes. Okay.

2323
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:36,910
But isn't that possible that that's
just through development of constant,

2324
02:16:37,050 --> 02:16:40,780
it is also possible calm while you
were in life threatening situations.

2325
02:16:40,820 --> 02:16:44,470
It's possible like to see fighters
brains measured in that regard.

2326
02:16:44,471 --> 02:16:49,240
I would like to see soldiers, well,
special forces guys. I think that's right.

2327
02:16:49,241 --> 02:16:50,710
And the guys a special force guys.

2328
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:54,970
It's like the capacity to shoot back when
you're being shot at keeping your calm

2329
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:58,030
moving positions, you know, and so forth.

2330
02:16:58,031 --> 02:17:01,340
Those are all very important to
abilities, not panicking. Uh,

2331
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:03,910
but and it is also the case
that some people, for example,

2332
02:17:03,911 --> 02:17:07,150
the most famous study in this regard
was a study of London taxi drivers.

2333
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:10,750
London taxi drivers can go from any point
in the city to any other point in the

2334
02:17:10,751 --> 02:17:12,310
city.
It's called the knowledge.

2335
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:15,910
They have a mental map of the
whole city and it's freakish.

2336
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:20,890
It takes years to be able to know how to
navigate the city with the thousands of

2337
02:17:20,891 --> 02:17:21,091
Nate,

2338
02:17:21,091 --> 02:17:24,760
tens of thousands of street names and
they can do it by like dead reckoning.

2339
02:17:25,300 --> 02:17:27,550
They a scan.
This was a paper about 10 years ago.

2340
02:17:27,551 --> 02:17:31,300
They brain scan these guys and they had,
I forgot what region of the brain,

2341
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:36,280
but they had through learning it is
felt modify that region of the brain.

2342
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:40,960
So it's possible. Holland is like you
say, that he learned to be this way.

2343
02:17:40,961 --> 02:17:44,920
That is a big deal isn't firing because
he trained himself but I handled,

2344
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:48,810
handled, handled. I'm sorry handled
is this way because he learns well,

2345
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:53,820
but it's more likely I think that he's
like Usain bolt that was born with the

2346
02:17:54,530 --> 02:17:55,270
credibly,

2347
02:17:55,270 --> 02:17:58,840
a high preponderance of fast twitch
fibers in his leg so he can run like the

2348
02:17:58,841 --> 02:18:01,750
wind and he trains as
well. You have both, right.

2349
02:18:01,751 --> 02:18:06,751
Good athletes require both innate ability
plus training and I think a Honnold is

2350
02:18:07,091 --> 02:18:09,500
probably like that.
He was probably born with an Amygdala.

2351
02:18:09,501 --> 02:18:13,100
It doesn't fire so much and
he's an amazing, uh, you know,

2352
02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:15,550
climber is purely speculative,
right? Like the, and they also,

2353
02:18:15,551 --> 02:18:18,430
the nature versus nurture would
apply to chess players as well.

2354
02:18:18,431 --> 02:18:23,350
I would like to see their brain scan like
w uh, Gary Kasparov. I know Gary. Yes.

2355
02:18:23,470 --> 02:18:25,840
I would love to see that. I
got a brain scan. Yes. Yeah.

2356
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:26,930
He's an interesting guy to hit.

2357
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:29,660
What I'll say. The article goes way
more into depth and night. Well,

2358
02:18:29,661 --> 02:18:32,090
I just showed you about,
okay. Just that sentence. She,

2359
02:18:32,091 --> 02:18:36,820
she's at the doctor who studied it was
specifically looks at people that go

2360
02:18:36,821 --> 02:18:39,340
under high stress and look
for those kinds of things.

2361
02:18:39,341 --> 02:18:43,450
She's been doing that since 2005, I
guess. And she goes, it's pages long.

2362
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:47,380
This whole thing about his brain,
but it is unusual, but it also,

2363
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:50,390
the amount of time, think about
people that are in high stress.

2364
02:18:50,391 --> 02:18:51,560
High stress is one thing.

2365
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:56,830
This kid is in a life threatening
absolute fatality situation.

2366
02:18:58,561 --> 02:19:03,320
Mistake his death every
day. I know all day. I know.

2367
02:19:03,470 --> 02:19:07,580
I mean, he lives in a van and just
climbs. Yes. That's what he does.

2368
02:19:07,581 --> 02:19:11,840
It's really fascinating. Yes, it is. It
is. It's amazing. Honestly. It's amazing.

2369
02:19:11,841 --> 02:19:15,590
So I mean, I don't know. I'd
never met him. I admire him
very much. And I love this.

2370
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:20,060
Like we said at the beginning, it's very
important to have skills of any kind.

2371
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:23,450
So his skills are
amazing. Uh, admire music,

2372
02:19:23,451 --> 02:19:28,280
musical skills in carpentry skills
and martial arts skills and skills and

2373
02:19:28,281 --> 02:19:31,850
medical. I admire skills, you know, I
think it's in its worth cultivating. Yeah.

2374
02:19:32,010 --> 02:19:33,420
It's worth cultivating those skills.

2375
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:37,790
So you find out more about
yourself through acquiring
these skills and knowledge

2376
02:19:37,791 --> 02:19:40,230
and information and just abilities.
Yes.

2377
02:19:40,270 --> 02:19:44,600
You learn and you also learn about
how to acquire skills. Yes. Yes,

2378
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:47,570
I think that's right. And I think,
uh, and I think it's also a kind of,

2379
02:19:47,910 --> 02:19:49,640
you also find oftentimes that the,

2380
02:19:49,650 --> 02:19:54,440
the practice of acquiring the skill
teaches you other things that can then be

2381
02:19:54,441 --> 02:19:58,760
used in other areas. Yeah. So even
if you like, you know, like, uh,

2382
02:19:58,790 --> 02:20:02,450
like you make the effort to learn the
violin or to learn Chinese for example,

2383
02:20:02,451 --> 02:20:05,000
or whatever, you know, some effort, you,

2384
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:08,270
that self discipline then
can be translated into even
just something that you're

2385
02:20:08,271 --> 02:20:10,430
not so good at it,
but it's still useful to have that.

2386
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:14,210
That's the mia moto massage. He quote the
book from the Book of five rings once,

2387
02:20:14,211 --> 02:20:19,040
you know, the way broadly you see it in
all things. Yes. Yeah. That's very good.

2388
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:23,180
Yeah. I remember at my mind is lashing
back to, we're talking about mortality.

2389
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:27,680
Do you remember that scene at
a, at Helms Helms deep when, uh,

2390
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:32,660
in the Lord of the rings when,
um, uh, they're protecting,
you know, the, the, uh,

2391
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:36,170
the key to the castle and the
elves come and help the humans.

2392
02:20:36,171 --> 02:20:39,410
Do you know the movie? Probably
know the, yeah. And I was,

2393
02:20:39,411 --> 02:20:42,860
I was very sad when these elves were
killed because if they hadn't been killed

2394
02:20:42,861 --> 02:20:46,470
by extrinsic forces, they would
have lived a long time. Uh,

2395
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:49,760
they would have been immortal. So it's
like a, especially sad loss. Anyway,

2396
02:20:49,761 --> 02:20:51,710
I had wanted to mention that earlier
when we were talking about that thing.

2397
02:20:51,711 --> 02:20:54,440
So now what was the saying again?
You just said about once, you know,

2398
02:20:54,441 --> 02:20:58,920
the way broadly you'll see it in all
things. Yes, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.

2399
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:03,320
It was just about acquiring excellence
in something that you understand what it

2400
02:21:03,321 --> 02:21:06,890
takes to acquire excellence in something
and you can apply that to other things

2401
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:11,870
as well. It's the same process, just a
different path. Yes, that's right. Well,

2402
02:21:11,871 --> 02:21:14,960
listen, Nicholas, thank you so much
for being here. Thank you so much.

2403
02:21:14,961 --> 02:21:16,820
I can't wait to read this book.
I'm going on vacation,

2404
02:21:16,821 --> 02:21:18,920
so I'm going to read this
with me. All right. And, uh,

2405
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:22,040
some of the stories at the beginning,
I really did. Thank you so much,

2406
02:21:22,041 --> 02:21:25,250
so much for having me. Shit.
I've been really grateful.
Thanks man. Thanks so much.

2407
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:26,270
Bye everybody.
