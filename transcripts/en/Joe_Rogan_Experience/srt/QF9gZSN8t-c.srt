1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,690
In the house.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,030
We just got done doing the podcast.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,403
We're so casual.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,161
I'm wearing socks,

5
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:12,510
so he's got fucking flip flops on.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,940
Hold my finger tips.

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,470
Don't give a shit crazy.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,880
You were fucking hilarious today as well.

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,380
And if they wanna watch
your show birth to conquer.

10
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,370
It's on every Sunday night.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,611
Oh,

12
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:26,870
travel channel at eight o'clock Bam.

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,760
And spell dispelled.

14
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:33,761
Bert Kreischer for the B.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
E.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
R.

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
T.

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
K.

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
R.

20
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
E.

21
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
I.

22
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
S.

23
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
C.

24
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
H.

25
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
E.

26
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,920
R.

27
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,921
S.

28
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:34,754
A lot of words.

29
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,511
The letters,

30
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:35,751
right.

31
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:40,751
Brian should change that
to what k likes to fuck.

32
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,740
Yeah,

33
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,440
like Danny Kaye will
remind people of Nostalgia.

34
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:49,820
You're like an old school entertainer.

35
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,631
Be Bert,

36
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:50,901
Bert,

37
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:51,171
Bert,

38
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:52,990
three times all it.

39
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,361
Well,

40
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:53,901
now that you said it,

41
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:54,800
someone's going to go grab it

42
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,930
30 minutes.

43
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,591
Give me 30 minutes.

44
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,221
Don't post this time.

45
00:00:58,221 --> 00:00:58,791
30 minutes.

46
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,031
Bert,

47
00:00:59,031 --> 00:00:59,241
Bert,

48
00:00:59,241 --> 00:00:59,570
Bert,

49
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,261
Bert for permanent.

50
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,094
Try to change it.

51
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,950
That's not a bad idea because
people probably can't spell crusher

52
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,240
twice.

53
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,830
Yeah,

54
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,221
the wrong.

55
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:11,090
The first time I tried it when I just
yesterday I had to go back and look at my

56
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,110
Twitter and get it right.

57
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,610
It'd be great if I was in Germany.

58
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,450
Why is that?

59
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,480
Because then everyone knows how to
spell cards should be a crutch for us.

60
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,480
You mean like Rogan?

61
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,750
Yeah.

62
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,040
Crushers.

63
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,521
A tricky one,

64
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,090
right?

65
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,950
I think burp prep work.

66
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,460
Could you get that Bert?

67
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:22,850
Bert.

68
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,230
Bert Twitter.

69
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,263
Yeah.

70
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,820
Prep.

71
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:27,961
Prep,

72
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:28,170
prep.

73
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,450
Do you really need all those letters?

74
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,380
It was Bert.

75
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,213
Bert.

76
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,171
If I just go Bubba,

77
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:32,441
Bubba,

78
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:32,721
Bubba,

79
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:33,554
bubba.

80
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,331
How about Burke?

81
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:36,164
Did you see Bert

82
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,471
never know.

83
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,260
Mass tweet.

84
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,300
First time to be taken
per toys taken right away.

85
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,800
I had the chance to buy Bert,

86
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,580
um,

87
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,630
the Burt website,

88
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,580
burt.com and I was like,

89
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:47,031
websites.

90
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:48,140
Who's gonna fucking use these?

91
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,101
What am I going to post up?

92
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:49,934
Shit on it.

93
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,550
I almost had Joe rogan.com
at one point in time.

94
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,490
Then this fucking real estate
guy got it out from under me.

95
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,440
The same thing I didn't think of,

96
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,621
well,

97
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:57,410
it was a website.

98
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,580
Then I can give a shit about website.

99
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,980
The available has that take the,

100
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,790
so please.

101
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,003
People will know.

102
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,690
Find me.

103
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,600
Prepper bird on Twitter.

104
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:09,791
Oh No,

105
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,860
it's Holly Koon is the girl's name.

106
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,940
How about Bert?

107
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,400
X three x three that's ridiculous.

108
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,260
What if I got Burt Reynolds?

109
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,821
You can get burnt.

110
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:22,690
Raul's fuck yeah.

111
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,050
He spelled the same way
or is it B u r t though?

112
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,760
It's,

113
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:25,950
Oh,

114
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,711
it's B u r t,

115
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,110
but I'll be br drunk.

116
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,223
Bert.

117
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,313
Bert.

118
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,670
Did you try to give birth to conquer to,

119
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,150
it's too many.

120
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,983
What letters?

121
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,950
Travel.

122
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,300
Telegraph.

123
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,300
Burke conquers moves to active of and
that still people are not going to flaking

124
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,420
on how to spell conqueror.

125
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,220
Conquer is hard to spell it.

126
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,100
I have to show and I fucking out CLN.

127
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,150
See Kong were you usually you are.

128
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,790

UNC.

130
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,390
See UNK conch were caucus.

131
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,253
Yeah.

132
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,930
This is our video blog.

133
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,370
We do this every week.

134
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,100
Now.

135
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,050
I know what the fuck's going on,

136
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,191
man.

137
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,930
This is full of multimedia.

138
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,140
Yeah,

139
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,281
man.

140
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:08,860
We're perfecting,

141
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,490
attacking on all fronts to try to try to
avoid the Hollywood machine for when I

142
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:12,930
make my,

143
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,900
my truck out of California.

144
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:14,420
Again,

145
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,130
it's not Brian's kind.

146
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,341
Let me,

147
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,174
right Brian?

148
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,770
If it's Texas or maybe boulder or Denver.

149
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:20,480
Yeah,

150
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,313
boulder,

151
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,213
maybe Denver.

152
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,080
I don't think I want to go
anywhere like Oregon or anything.

153
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,093
San Diego,

154
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,323
how you want to

155
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,473
say hi to everyone?

156
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:32,690
Listen,

157
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,140
this is being recorded
so don't say the n word.

158
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,381
Okay.

159
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,214
Keep going.

160
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,171
I love you.

161
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,004
I'll talk to you later.

162
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,273
All right.

163
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,471
Greetings,

164
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,960
civilized gentlemen and ladies.

165
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:47,960
Throughout the land we break,

166
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,750
we drink wine like the
sophisticated we are,

167
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,930
we are multifaceted.

168
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:52,620
We have wine,

169
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,341
coconut water,

170
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:54,200
and yeah,

171
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,871
we don't fuck around.

172
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:57,360
We have a plethora of beverages here.

173
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,880
Kevin Pereira is here
from attack of the show

174
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,440
and just life.

175
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:01,850
I want,

176
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,551
don't want to define you,

177
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,110
but one thing that's all right.

178
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:04,944
Most people do.

179
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,260
Hey Man,

180
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,490
you talking about your factor guy.

181
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,290
Nice legs on the line,

182
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,723
legs

183
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,190
spread.

184
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,240
And you were telling us this,

185
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:15,010
this wine is,

186
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,510
uh,

187
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:15,920
it's,

188
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,160
it comes from some guy who was an
infomercial came apparently he made a

189
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:19,994
bazillion,

190
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,270
uh,

191
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,750
off of infomercials in the 90s.

192
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,930
Bought a bunch of land and they have it.

193
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,440
I love stories like that.

194
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,613
Like how,

195
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,750
how to ditch slow me.

196
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,150
How did Mr Slap Chop?

197
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:29,984
Really Matt?

198
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,183
Yeah,

199
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,911
that guy.

200
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:32,181
Yeah.

201
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:33,410
He fucked up with a hooker.

202
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,321
Prostitutes.

203
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,430
You the slap chop guy shot him.

204
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:37,701
Right.

205
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:40,250
Did she bite his tongue because he
was telling her and then he hit her.

206
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,890
She bit his tongue and he thinks that,

207
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,130
yeah.

208
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,620
Your timing in a hooker man,

209
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,301
woe to,

210
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:44,491
you know,

211
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,230
he's like a beat directory.

212
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:47,064
Direct studies,

213
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,470
the worst damn comedy movie or
something like that already.

214
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,020
Just did,

215
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,330
uh,

216
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,240
did the last movie with them and
I guess he's just a dirty fuck.

217
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,890
[inaudible]

218
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,530
you shouldn't in promoting the Shama then
he could have cleaned up the shame and

219
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,370
the crime afterwards.

220
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,090
Yeah.

221
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,190
That guy's probably rich
as fuck from that sham.

222
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:02,411
Wow.

223
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:02,761
Fun though.

224
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,000
Huh?

225
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,391
Fuck yeah.

226
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:04,470
Now I could fund movies.

227
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,150
He had Lindsay Lohan and
that was the last one.

228
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,040
I guess I just watched a ridiculous,

229
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,050
this commercial with Elisabeth Hasselbeck,

230
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:10,291
whatever.

231
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,240
What does it is a bit
hassled then had a really,

232
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,950
really conservative ones interview
and she's on a fucking app thing.

233
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,660
Stupid machine.

234
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:19,860
There's no way it fucking works.

235
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,150
And she's standing there ripped
and chisel looking sexy as fuck.

236
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,601
You know,

237
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:25,530
like with a little thing.

238
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,090
Total exposed APP.

239
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,460
Talking about this allows
me to keep in shape.

240
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,390
If you're like me and you don't have the
time to get to the gym or the view will

241
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,230
enjoy this view

242
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,193
type

243
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,653
vaginal muscle,

244
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,190
it's,

245
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,710
it's,

246
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,730
it's a stupid product,

247
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:43,080
but I bet she's going to make $1 billion.

248
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,470
Every time I see another plastic
thing with belts or police or leavers,

249
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,250
I go,

250
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,450
I gotta come up with
the next one and I go,

251
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,250
there's no more ways to do a crunch.

252
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,290
And then some asshole comes up with the,

253
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,850
here's the device you strap on,

254
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:54,331
lay down,

255
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:55,320
and it works your core.

256
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,370
They always keep coming up.

257
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,230
There's one that's just a spring
with a stick and he'd go like that.

258
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:00,840
Have you seen that one?

259
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,190
Yeah.

260
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,260
It's like sticks between
your life looks so stupid.

261
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,250
Like a shock absorber.

262
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,270
And he pushed down like my dad
believed in the weight belts.

263
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,140
That would shock you
like a little ad belts.

264
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,450
Right?

265
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,390
My Dad's big old gut.

266
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,810
So he went and got two of
the most powerful ones you
could get and he would put

267
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,820
them on you supposed to be like lose
your belly with Kay white jelly or

268
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:18,980
something like that so it doesn't
conduct right to the skin.

269
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,061
He wouldn't do that.

270
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,560
He's giant in Portuguese and angry.

271
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,670
So He'd wear two belts,

272
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,700
like sit there for like four hours and
just watch Jerry Springer and then he's

273
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,480
done.

274
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,350
He would have either played,

275
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:30,740
connect the dots on his belly,

276
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,560
but he was just shocking his gut
to some ways that didn't work.

277
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,461
It didn't work.

278
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,510
That doesn't work well,

279
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:39,140
electrical muscle stimulation they
use in rehab so it has some sort of an

280
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:39,501
effect.

281
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:39,740
Right,

282
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,190
but it's more grainy nine plastic belt
that you're getting at 4:00 AM is not

283
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,020
going to be the same of
stem you're getting from,

284
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,820
but if just chiropractors crank them up,

285
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,530
have the same effect at times,

286
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:49,970
make noises,

287
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,260
but 23 does that.

288
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:52,120
When he moves in bout

289
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,060
what?

290
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,491
I had a,

291
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:55,780
I don't know,

292
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,030
bad muscle pull my leg wants
to put me on that shit.

293
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,870
Electrical muscular stimulation and
try to revive the area that was torn.

294
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,330
It's interesting to work.

295
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,450
Um,

296
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,010
I don't know,

297
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,231
you know,

298
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:06,400
everything heals up in time.

299
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,140
It's hard to say what
exactly made heal up.

300
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,561
But,

301
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,070
um,

302
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,420
they had,

303
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,253
they were selling them on,

304
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,640
on TV for bodybuilders,

305
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,580
but if that shit worked,

306
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,200
there'd be due to her addicted to that.

307
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,460
I do think maybe wearing right now
it was actually a place in oh wow.

308
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,490
Or a member and there was
a place back in Boston,

309
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,360
um,

310
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,460
when I body by design,

311
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,540
I believe it was called,

312
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,021
it might be,

313
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,100
I might have made it the wrong name.

314
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,690
I think it was babied by design though.

315
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,823
Um,

316
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,720
that might be totally wrong though.

317
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,950
Don't sue me on us.

318
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,933
But it was a,

319
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,300
um,

320
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,930
a place where all you did
was go and get zapped.

321
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,990
You go there and lay down and they would
cover you with these electrodes and

322
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,330
they would give you a body by design.

323
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,290
Like that was the idea,

324
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:45,900
you know,

325
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,480
and I they couldn't have possibly,

326
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,501
are you sure,

327
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,340
but that's,

328
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,611
and that work,

329
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,280
there would be no 24 hour
fitness or la fitness.

330
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:55,130
I want to make the cheap version of
that with the plastic Chinese parts.

331
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,880
And you would just do it wast
just be break up in the morning.

332
00:07:58,881 --> 00:07:59,714
I'll swole.

333
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,110
But Bruce Lee was into that shit too.

334
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,501
It's like,

335
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:04,060
I think it's,

336
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,893
you know,

337
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,760
people tend to buy these machines that
you stand on and he's cleaned that

338
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:11,030
Russian cosmonauts he was done and it
just shakes you and the clean up makes you

339
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:11,864
and shame.

340
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,380
Oh,

341
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,700
Ryan doesn't make any in shape.

342
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,030
No,

343
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,890
it doesn't get you in shape like an,

344
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,660
it stimulates your glands.

345
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,880
There's really the Russian cosmonauts
wherever those stand space.

346
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:20,361
We'll talk about it.

347
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:20,930
I'm going to try it.

348
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,763
I'm going to try it.

349
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,980
All right.

350
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,813
Kevin Pereira.

351
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,241
Oh,

352
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:27,330
podcast pitches that everybody
know what's up bitches.

353
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,160
I don't think so.

354
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,100
Like I used to be,

355
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,060
I used to be fat.

356
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,460
I got and then I got crazy
the other end of spectrum.

357
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,220
Okay,

358
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,640
do this.

359
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,473
Just this

360
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,870
35 pounds.

361
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,300
That's like,

362
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,070
but and using your whole body,

363
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,850
you do two things.

364
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,803
One,

365
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,150
you made your body work as a unit.

366
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,560
What'd you don't do?

367
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,663
Just like,

368
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,780
I don't agree with any of that
stuff that's very isolating stuff.

369
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,183
No bench,

370
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,360
no curls,

371
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,650
no tricep extension.

372
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,300
I think all that stuff is bad for you.

373
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,273
Yeah.

374
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,910
I think it gives you an imbalance.

375
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,130
I think the best one you use your body,

376
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,780
it's used at all as one unit.

377
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,690
Yeah,

378
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,171
it probably is though.

379
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:13,890
Like my,

380
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,940
with my knee issues,

381
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:18,240
that's going to limit what
exercise blew it out to the slots,

382
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,403
you know,

383
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,521
click.

384
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:22,050
So I'm not spending all this stuff,

385
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,510
but you know he's doing,

386
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,200
yeah,

387
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,501
he does.

388
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,940
But he knows what he's
doing for him and he's a,

389
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,200
he's a monster.

390
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,153
I'm a ton of time.

391
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,480
It should be 35 pounds.

392
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,640
His playing weight.

393
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,730
Is it right to count bass by
tapping your penis and other for it?

394
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,830
I feel like that's something
that he's just doing.

395
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,910
This is not going to let you cheat.

396
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,980
You didn't do a little newbie.

397
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:47,814
Again,

398
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,040
like same thing.

399
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,340
It's still like this clean
hold it there like that.

400
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:53,800
Yeah.

401
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,780
Press it up big time.

402
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:59,430
And this is one 35 times in east side
sheep decree and keep your back nice and

403
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,660
straight and go deep.

404
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,920
Hold it down,

405
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,540
hold it.

406
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,373
Delays.

407
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,670
I'll play dungeon rate on a stair master.

408
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,490
[inaudible] my out.

409
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,610
Well it was a scared as well.

410
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:22,611
Do you remember were there in Phoenix
where there's a video game and you could

411
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:24,830
play like a boss again?

412
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,151
No,

413
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,984
it was tanks.

414
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,350
We've got an elliptical machine or I'll
come back from Atari that combat with

415
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,313
that

416
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,590
too much.

417
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,423
Well that's the neat,

418
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,290
it's like what is wrong?

419
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:36,960
Your name?

420
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,531
Great question.

421
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,550
I got to go see somebody about it.

422
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,640
How long ago did it happen?

423
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,853
December.

424
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,780
December?

425
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,613
Yeah.

426
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,410
Yeah.

427
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,430
Do you remember what happened?

428
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,413
Um,

429
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,880
I've always had issues with
that was a rollerblader drummer.

430
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,260
Constantly Bang on it.

431
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:50,094
So

432
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,510
I'll feel a shipped and then it's just
pain in the area now it feels like when

433
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:56,710
I,

434
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,390
when I actually moved as it as a
distinct click and in his pants,

435
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,640
that sounds a little bit
like stability thing.

436
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,740
You might just be a giant profit podcast.

437
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,251
Kevin prayer.

438
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:08,500
Ladies,

439
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,430
gentleman kept cars and the
house got some flashlight.

440
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,660
The Best Goodie bag.

441
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,060
This is the non gender flood lights
and he could contend dude holds a whole

442
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,643
bowl.

443
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,080
One of the world's my oyster.

444
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,650
It can be your kid's room not there.

445
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,913
Okay.

446
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,871
Thank you very much.

447
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:34,530
Thank you.

448
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,363
That was awesome.

449
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,630
I mean there's all a lot of
fucking debris out at sea.

450
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,490
Findlaw car was on the podcast today.

451
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:49,324
Ladies and gentlemen,

452
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,580
I found out Friday.

453
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,370
Loves fishing and loves to play it.

454
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,900
Cool.

455
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,440
Two things near and dear to my heart.

456
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,393
Missing jobs

457
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,140
plus was a lot of pressure.

458
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,403
Okay.

459
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,303
All

460
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,203
right.

461
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,333
Very difficult game.

462
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,923
10 balls.

463
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,410
Cognizanti to Joe Gold made me Joe goals.

464
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,340
Can you tell a difference
between pool sticks?

465
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,193
Yeah,

466
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,473
sure.

467
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,053
Huge difference.

468
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,260
I have a bunch of different cues made
by a bunch of like really high end pool

469
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,941
king makers.

470
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:49,670
Like the only thing that
I collect is pool cues.

471
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,710
The two ball.

472
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,593
Yes.

473
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,063
Okay.

474
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,590
Oh No.

475
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,090
Aw Shit like that.

476
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,293
Hmm.

477
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,573
Crap.

478
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,260
Only a house of rogue and where you see
monsters and mixed with Fisher price.

479
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,213
Wow.

480
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,630
I just got embarrassed.

481
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,200
Just the game side.

482
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,990
I don't know if I even
hit a ball warmed up yet.

483
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,290
Fats just school.

484
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,230
It's not feminist.

485
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,350
Started there as he

486
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,920
plays like he is.

487
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:55,680
Well,

488
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,513
playing games,

489
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,790
playing games in the future,

490
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,501
you're risking,

491
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,300
you're risking your
future talking nonsense.

492
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,193
Yeah.

493
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,160
Dave,

494
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,993
you from this,

495
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,953
we're talking about race,

496
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,203
talking about

497
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,530
[inaudible],

498
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,820
disrespect,

499
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,450
ugly hells angels.

500
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,740
[inaudible].
