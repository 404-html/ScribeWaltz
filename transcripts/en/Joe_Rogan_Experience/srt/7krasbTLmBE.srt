1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,520
Okay,

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,890
boom.
That's it alive.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,840
We're on now.
Fuck you,

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,890
Joe Rogan.
My man.

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,170
Thanks so much for having me back.
Thanks for coming back.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,410
There's a lot of pee everywhere.
I F this is the fucking tonight show,

7
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,490
man.
Where I go.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,870
My and her.
John,

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,690
Joe Rogan heard you on Joe Rogan's.
Been the last year of my life so

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,450
I can stop at.
Stop fucking answering them when I'm

11
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,000
going to be back back right now.
You are back right now?

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,560
Yeah,
it feels weird.

13
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,420
It feels like it feels like it was here
like two days ago.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,860
That's a problem.
Maybe you're drinking too much on the

15
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,840
road.
I definitely was drinking too much.

16
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:46,560
Um,
I,

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,420
uh,
I went to my,

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,010
the last tour I ended up in a,
I don't want to make,

19
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,870
it's not too bad.
Ended up in the emergency room in the

20
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:56,090
last tour with,
uh,

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,370
with the Ivs,
but the fucking real shit.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,870
Yeah.
I went a little too.

23
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,890
I don't know,
I don't.

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,950
They said it was kind of just exhaustion
and you know,

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,330
whatever.
And you know,

26
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,370
the,
the normal.

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,940
I think that people at the emergency
room wouldn't believe me that it wasn't,

28
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:15,150
you know,
on hardcore drugs because they come in

29
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:16,500
and I'm just,
I'm fucking out of it.

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,380
And I am
like,

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,451
where you been?
I've been,

32
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,750
I've been out on tour.
Then I go,

33
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:23,580
shit,
we know what's up and they torched it on

34
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,830
my blood work and there was no shit in
there.

35
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:27,540
And then nothing at all.
No,

36
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,780
I think,
I think it was honestly kind of just

37
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,160
meet at what they did,
find some kind of like vibe,

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,010
like a bug or whatever,
just bug that I had been on.

39
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,450
That probably was more of it than I
thought,

40
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:44,451
but I really do think it was just
kind of nonstop every night rocking out

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,070
and you know,
pushing it a little too hard.

42
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,780
So you really did wind up in the
emergency room?

43
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:52,320
Yeah.
Yeah,

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,480
it was that.
I mean the official diagnosis was just

45
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,640
exhaustion.
What were you worried about?

46
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:58,560
Like what did you think?
You didn't think you could just go to

47
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,370
sleep?

48
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,960
Like how does one go to the emergency
room?

49
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,880
What happened?
What happened was I,

50
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,190
um,
I was off the tour and had a meeting

51
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,950
with some managers and shit and in the
meeting I fucking barfed like in a,

52
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,290
in a,
in a nice building.

53
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,780
We're in a nice building talking about
shit rush.

54
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,380
You're talking about the shit that rick
is over here doing it with like guys in

55
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:18,730
suits and I fucking threw up on myself.
Whoa.

56
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,860
And they go,
are you okay?

57
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:21,300
And I go,
I think I am in,

58
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,720
they hand me a banana to get some food
in me and I couldn't peel the banana.

59
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,900
So then I just,
I drove myself to the emergency room,

60
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,180
couldn't peel the banana,
didn't have the strength to open a

61
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,560
banana.
Really?

62
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,890
Yeah.
But I do now.

63
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,280
Um,
and then I,

64
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,750
um,
I drove myself to the emergency room and

65
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:43,240
they hooked me up to ivs,
like put me on fluids and everything.

66
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,730
Just to give you an example,
I,

67
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,840
I,
so when they finally said I was good to

68
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:48,250
go,
I went back out and I couldn't fucking

69
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,790
find my car
and I just checked my parking ticket.

70
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,720
I was like,
where's this lot?

71
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:55,450
And I called the guy on the lot,
he's like,

72
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:56,920
yeah,
your cars in here.

73
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:01,921
It's the windows are down and it's,
I guess apparently I just drove myself

74
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:06,220
to the emergency room and fucking close
the doors and walked into the emergency

75
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
room and said help me.

76
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,683
Wow.

77
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,570
So yeah.
And I actually,

78
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,404
you know,
while he was,

79
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,870
we talked about last time a guy who was
a big help to me.

80
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,080
Then I was just like,
I reached out to starch,

81
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:16,660
I'll just like,
you know,

82
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,650
do you ever get like,
just because at the time I just,

83
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:22,330
I didn't know I had a bug.
I thought it was just pure exhaustion,

84
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:24,970
which again,
doesn't that sound like the old rock,

85
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,710
the rock star,
like heroin excuse,

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,540
like he's exhausted,
he has to cancel a tour.

87
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,490
And I reached out to Sturgis and he's
just like,

88
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:31,250
yeah man,
you gotTa,

89
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,880
you know,
take care of yourself out there.

90
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,733
Just,
you know,

91
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,310
it's mental,
physical,

92
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,180
everything.
Fatiguing,

93
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,010
you know,
I think I need to figure out a way.

94
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,803
It's funny,
I was,

95
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,560
I forget who you were talking to a few
weeks ago talking about um,

96
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,340
talking spirits,
shit about suicide and stuff and about

97
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,760
how exercise is such an important part
of that and I've been on a pretty

98
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,480
vigorous.

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,740
I've been,
you can't tell,

100
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:56,940
but I've been running a ton which you've
been running to and um,

101
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,530
I was talking to a doctor recently and
he was like,

102
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,180
um,
uh,

103
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,210
he told me about a study they did with
um,

104
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,910
with like $200.
He told me he was like a couple,

105
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,880
the 200 depressed people and the study
was half of them.

106
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,230
They gave Prozac the other half they put
on a strict like running regimen.

107
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,780
They said there was no difference
between the two.

108
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,620
It's like they both,
they were both helped a ton and the,

109
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,270
the running,
I don't want to give out,

110
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,320
you know,
medical information,

111
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,154
but that's,
you know.

112
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,390
Yeah.
The woman I had on Kelly Brogan,

113
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:32,720
she's a psychiatrist.
She said that it's more effective.

114
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,450
That exercise is actually more effective
than psych meds.

115
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,284
I'm wondering

116
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,130
just the fact that a doctor told me that
makes me think that he was airing on,

117
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,540
you know,
he still wants to sell the drugs,

118
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:46,190
but I'm just wondering if like um,
because I started when I fucking run,

119
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:48,950
I feel fucking great.
I mean I can't do it in cowboy boots and

120
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:49,784
shit,
but you know,

121
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,230
it's hard to do.
It's hard to wake when you're on,

122
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,510
when you do the tours.
Tours just hard to wake up before

123
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,300
showing.

124
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,230
Yeah,
it's very hard.

125
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,700
But you gotta do it.
You've got to do it.

126
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,480
Like it's brushing your teeth.
Like it's,

127
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,690
you know,
it's just something that is.

128
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,530
If you give yourself the possibility
that you won't do it,

129
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,540
then you won't do it.
Exactly.

130
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,650
And I think in my back,
my head,

131
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:10,610
I'm like,
well this is a tour,

132
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,250
this is a little vacation,
a little break and that's just,

133
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,900
that's why I need it the most.
I got to start.

134
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,090
When you think about it as a tour,
is that what you think about?

135
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,020
I think about it as work.
I think about his work,

136
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:21,920
but I think about it as like,
that's my excuse for not.

137
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,511
Oh yeah.
It's definitely.

138
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,560
It's definitely more work than anything.
Yeah.

139
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:27,350
The human brain seeks comfort,
man.

140
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,010
We like to fuck ourselves up.
I try to take those little nap so you

141
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,160
don't really need and blow things off
that you really should do.

142
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,700
So.
Weird Shit.

143
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,160
We just got back from New York City and
I,

144
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,750
I fell asleep on the couch for what?
You know,

145
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,320
I just woke up from.
I just slept for 12 hours.

146
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,760
Wow.
I feel.

147
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,950
I feel great now,
but

148
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,440
I bet it would help you with this torn.
I bet if you like really got hardcore

149
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,610
into shape and start eating right.
I brought it would definitely help.

150
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,281
Totally.
Yeah.

151
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,740
Well I'm not going to work.
We got a tour lined up for I think mid

152
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,573
July and I'm not.

153
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,820
I'm not going if I don't do it,
like if I don't get up and fight,

154
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,660
don't make sure there's someone there
making me do all that shit.

155
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,340
I ain't going to do the tour because
I've been looking at your tour online

156
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:09,560
and.
But looking at some of the photos and

157
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,540
videos from your shows,
they're insane.

158
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,950
Yeah.
It's been pretty crazy.

159
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,810
You know,
you're doing giant places.

160
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,700
I'm a giant,
but you know,

161
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,740
uh,
hoping that it gets bigger.

162
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,860
But it's been,
it's been fun.

163
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,050
It's,
it's a um,

164
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,810
it's been a fucking blast.
You know,

165
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,490
one,
to me,

166
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,500
one thing,
I hate to change the subject,

167
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:33,380
but it's just like I'm going get the new
record out here,

168
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,770
boy out and I'm still making records.
Yeah.

169
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,880
This,
I think this one's better.

170
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,010
But Jamie,
what are that sound?

171
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,970
I mean,
I mean like actual physical copy.

172
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:41,960
I know it's the only thing I could
bring.

173
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,060
I can't like bring it out like to
spotify.

174
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,370
I should have just.
Yeah.

175
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,540
Um,
it's almost like,

176
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,050
these are kind of silly now because I
gave it to one guy.

177
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:52,440
He's like,
my man,

178
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,170
you give it to somebody that their
desktop,

179
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,400
their laptop doesn't even have a CD
player and you're like,

180
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,930
thanks for the CD.
I'll throw it in the back of the car and

181
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,060
load it up and listened to it in the
car.

182
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,800
Most cars still have a CD player.
Bet they'll stop pretty soon.

183
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,760
Oh yeah,
for sure.

184
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,060
I used to have a,
an Acura NSX and had a cassette player

185
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:13,600
and is still the cell phone holders.
That's where they're putting the thing

186
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,880
to hold them.
Now instead of put it in your error,

187
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,960
dear air filter thing or the AC comes
out to clip on that.

188
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,690
There's like a little thing that spreads
out to this fits in the CD slot.

189
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,300
Ah,
taking up space.

190
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,530
I don't know about you,
but what my new thing is everywhere I

191
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:26,950
go,
you know,

192
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,970
I ran,
I ran a car.

193
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:31,450
I'll get to the airport and rent a car.
Right in the first 20 minutes is mason

194
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,370
in that fucking car trying to figure out
the Bluetooth and it.

195
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,690
Every time you find that it just like
every fucking one.

196
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,780
They make it so fucking impaler

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,430
yeah.
I love cadillacs,

198
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:43,420
but God damn that escalate.
Infotainment system is a piece of shit.

199
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,360
It's so bad.
It's so hard to work.

200
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,510
Apparently they switched it.
Now they're going to do apple car play,

201
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,770
which is infinitely better.

202
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,780
You might.
Uber driver had that the other day I

203
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,560
asked him,
finally had something to talk about with

204
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,700
my uber driver.
He was telling me,

205
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,450
explain it to me.
It looked like the whole interface was

206
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,980
just.

207
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,850
Yeah,
it's like a phone.

208
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,740
It's not the whole interface because you
know,

209
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:04,430
you can't get most of your apps,
but you get things like messages,

210
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:06,440
podcasts,
things on the science.

211
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,050
Yeah,
I mean the good.

212
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,520
I mean,
what I was kind of getting to before is,

213
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,870
you know,
we're talking about the crowds and shit,

214
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,600
which was when I first put out these
crazy records of mine,

215
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,400
um,
you know,

216
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,090
the,
the,

217
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,520
the assumption was,
um,

218
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,850
you know,
there's nowhere,

219
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,280
there's nowhere to go,
right to terrestrial radio won't play

220
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,260
me.
I ain't doing all that shit,

221
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,600
but I don't want to kiss your ass too
much.

222
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:27,470
You know,
you know that.

223
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,940
But it was kind of finding this kind of
like,

224
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,570
this is all,
everything's fucking equal now.

225
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:35,460
It's like I was.
That was kind of the big breakthrough

226
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:39,910
for me was like,
and I did a few weeks ago,

227
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:42,610
did Joey Coco Diaz who's my new favorite
fucking dude,

228
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:45,130
this is the best time I'm now in the
Rogan world.

229
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:46,450
I did that and Bert Kreischer.
It's like,

230
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,350
it's like,
it's like doing the tonight show.

231
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,430
Then like Colby and I'm telling you
these things and I've got numbers to

232
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:55,264
prove it.
It's,

233
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,370
there is no mainstream media.
It's like if you go to the backdoor and

234
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,270
do all this shit,
it's,

235
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,660
it's bigger than that fucking shit.
What mainstream media if you.

236
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,900
No,
the actual numbers that they get,

237
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,410
it's not even close.
Like a good show on CNN,

238
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,020
you know,
might get a million,

239
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,240
a million and a half views.
If we got a million and a half

240
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:15,800
downloads,
we've pretty bummed out.

241
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,280
Yeah,
it's crazy because the week I came in

242
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,300
here,
I never even told you this.

243
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:24,301
So that week I came in here another,
someone told someone has access to these

244
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:25,271
numbers.
I don't have them,

245
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:29,770
but they said
I sold more albums from being on here.

246
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:33,790
Then the artists that we did on snl,
so this is,

247
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,540
that makes sense.
Like what is snl get what kind of uses

248
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,374
this?
And I'll get

249
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,820
on a good episode.
We'll get 10 million downloads.

250
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,860
Great.
I mean also too,

251
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:45,910
you know,
here it's,

252
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:47,820
you know,
it's me talking to you on snl.

253
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,360
It's like,
do they make it to the music?

254
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:50,610
Probably not.
They're just there now.

255
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,340
Some funny.

256
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,290
Well not only that,
they don't watch the whole thing because

257
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,560
snl,
I love snl sometimes.

258
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,770
SNL is one of those things though.
They fuck you like 70 percent of the

259
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:00,640
time.
Yeah.

260
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,130
I got really pissed about it.
And point 7 million views,

261
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,170
uh,
with the rock.

262
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,430
That's a one.
Oh,

263
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:07,600
the finale.
Okay.

264
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:11,950
So that's their big one of the year.
So the other big one is smaller than

265
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:14,380
yours and normal one.
Okay.

266
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:18,640
Melissa Mccarthy was 10 million of the
top two.

267
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:22,150
Okay.
So our top one for the year was Alex

268
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,130
Jones at 15 million.
And then number two be Neil.

269
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,013
I think

270
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,910
Alex Jones got put out of country
record.

271
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,540
You should probably should.
Reptilians and black helicopters and he

272
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,100
could do it too from Texas.
That shit would sell.

273
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.
Fucking would Alex Jones to just wanting

274
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,450
to country music,
country,

275
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,370
new world order music.
I'll fucking.

276
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,090
I'll produce that shit.
You should come on a show.

277
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,610
You should go on a show and just start
talking crazy shit about storage will

278
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:49,660
again.
Yeah.

279
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:52,180
Oh by the way,
and this is not for lawyer reasons,

280
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:55,810
but I'm sturgill Simpson is not
affiliated with the CIA,

281
00:10:55,811 --> 00:11:00,811
nor is he a trained CIA assassin.
I want to get that on the record last

282
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:01,750
time.
It's possible.

283
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:03,520
I may have mentioned that.
I think you did.

284
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:06,390
I think you said he worked for James
Comey and he was a.

285
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,830
yeah,
he has no affiliation with the CIA.

286
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,630
He's doing some weird fucking gigs in
Europe this year that look a little

287
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:18,310
fishy to me and I don't get it,
but I think it might be over there doing

288
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,430
some hits on the site.

289
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,010
The lawyer part of me says no,
but the sensible part of me,

290
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,140
he's doing some dates in Europe with
John Prine.

291
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:28,840
I think John Prine kind of talks to
them.

292
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,690
Sales them down and then starts.
We'll fucking take.

293
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,600
Who's that guy?
Who's John?

294
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,550
John.
John Prine.

295
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:37,030
Great.
Fucking a folk kind country singer.

296
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,010
He's great.
He's just getting into the country

297
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,530
world.
He's the last slide.

298
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,620
Almost call them like more like folk.
He's more in that kind of.

299
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,170
Isabel struck him in spiritual Sharon
office in Nashville.

300
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,360
Yeah.
It's bells in a weird category,

301
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:50,890
right?
He's kind of country,

302
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,480
but he's also kind of folk at this days.
We don't know nowadays what the fuck his

303
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,730
country who the funder is.
I complain about all the time,

304
00:11:57,731 --> 00:12:00,160
but you know,
Jason Isbell is a bad motherfucker

305
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:00,910
though.
Oh dear.

306
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,820
He damaged as I heard a few songs from
his new record.

307
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:04,654
Sounds killer.

308
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,190
Yeah.
I think he's going to ruffle some

309
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,220
feathers too because it sounds like a
little political,

310
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,690
which is a no,
no in that world,

311
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:11,524
you know,
so

312
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,830
um,
it's kind of a crazy day.

313
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,630
Did you watching that shit,
that shit this morning.

314
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,550
Call me stuff.
I didn't watch it.

315
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,320
Did you watch it?
I watched some of it,

316
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:22,510
but it was,
I felt like it was a waste.

317
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:27,511
It's just like shit we knew before.
It's just like politicians lie a Komi.

318
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,180
It was like I felt like we knew well,
I didn't see.

319
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:34,470
I didn't see anything fucking knew.
It seems like it's way too easy to fire

320
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,670
him.
Like you could just decide you don't

321
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:39,400
like what he's doing at firearm.
They didn't seem to be any like real

322
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,620
clear definitive reason why he was
fired.

323
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,833
He,
I mean like the,

324
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,640
like the main news is like I said,
politicians lie,

325
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,360
you know,
news flash and the other one was like,

326
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,650
you know,
they can make the point that like trump

327
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:51,484
is a different.

328
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,070
It's different than.
Most presidents were like he used to

329
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:55,180
host a reality show.
No Shit.

330
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,130
We knew that.
That was their big takeaway.

331
00:12:57,131 --> 00:13:01,150
It's like two hours of fucking.
I just used the time to fucking tweet

332
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:04,420
about my new record saying how I kept
tweeting that James Comey was.

333
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,240
It was all code for my new record that
he wanted people to buy it.

334
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,200
I know I saw some instagram posts that
had a Colombian endorsing your album.

335
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,310
Yeah.
He's a big fan.

336
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:12,850
He,
he,

337
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,490
he said he wanted to talk about it
during the hearings because that's a big

338
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:16,161
audience,
but the,

339
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,210
apparently they wouldn't let them go.
Yeah,

340
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,530
collusion between me and comey would
have fucked things up.

341
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,700
Is that what it's called?
Yeah.

342
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,400
Uh,
well I actually,

343
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,650
it's funny because this guy,
because there's,

344
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,470
they say there's a chance which looking
less like there's this guy,

345
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,290
luke combs who like my arch nemesis even
though he's a good dude.

346
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,320
I just,
he was up against me this week on the

347
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,240
country charts because my album comes
out.

348
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,570
My new album came out this week and I'm
trying to beat him and I sit on twitter

349
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:45,571
that Russians have colluded with Sony
records to like have him out sell me and

350
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,260
he kind of played along.
So we'll see.

351
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,181
I think,
I think,

352
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:50,740
I think they are,
I mean Nashville's definitely trying to

353
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,600
keep me down,
but are they really,

354
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,720
are they fucking with you?
Like how,

355
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,710
how are they receiving you now?
Now that you've become a mainstream

356
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,690
success?
Because I hear about you all the time.

357
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:02,050
Donald Cowboy Cerrone,
I think you know that he listens to your

358
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,500
music before he goes out and fights.
Ronnie reached out to me thanks to you,

359
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,960
he called,
he called me up and he was on the set of

360
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:11,500
a movie with Michael Madsen and uh,
they got,

361
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,540
I don't know how it seems like last
second,

362
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,830
but they'd go,
hey capital,

363
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,530
you've got a scene tomorrow where you
sing Karaoke with Michael Madsen.

364
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,950
And he saw you on saying and he's like,
fucking eating pussy kicking ass.

365
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,690
The producers like,
fuck you talking about.

366
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,180
He's like,
I want to say eating pussy kicking ass.

367
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,860
He's like,
do you have the rights to this song?

368
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:28,260
He's like,
I'll have it in like five minutes.

369
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,980
He just fucking calls me.
I call my peoples,

370
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:33,640
like now I'm in a movie with cowboy
cerrone and Michael Madsen singing eaton

371
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,680
pussy kicking ass.
He said he was in the trailer,

372
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,514
you know,
like,

373
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,560
you know,
rehearsing with Michael Madsen gets to

374
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,650
the sucking Dick Park.
And I think he was just like,

375
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,260
what the fuck we sing in here man.

376
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,000
He's been,
he's been awesome.

377
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,470
And um,
yeah,

378
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,970
kind of like I to,
I'm now in your world,

379
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:53,480
you know,
doing,

380
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,000
I just did.
I was telling you before I did joey,

381
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,410
Coco Diaz,
Bert Kreischer,

382
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:58,340
like all these dudes.
It's like,

383
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:01,340
it's cool to have.
It's cool because I went into the second

384
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:01,851
album,
I was like,

385
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,130
I gotta make my fucking money back.
You know,

386
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,350
it wasn't about the money.
I'm just saying it's like,

387
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,600
what am I going to,
it's going to be the same shit again.

388
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:12,110
But like no one I have these other
places to go now is so fucking great.

389
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,670
Yeah,
well that's,

390
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,850
there's a transition happening and I
think for the longest time they always

391
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:21,851
felt like the whole idea of mainstream
media like that was just going to be

392
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,520
locked up.
That was going to be the case forever.

393
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,200
It's CBS,
NBC,

394
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:29,270
the Cable News Networks.
They were gonna be there forever.

395
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,130
That's not really the case anymore.

396
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,680
No.
And like I said,

397
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,510
I've got the numbers to prove it,
but you know,

398
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,210
I came,
everyone was telling me,

399
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:39,070
you know,
you can't get on fucking good morning

400
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,110
America.
You can't be on fucking terrestrial

401
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:44,290
radio.
And I just kind of lucked into finding

402
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,330
this and you guys been being supportive
and shit.

403
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:48,940
It's just like these things are.
It's,

404
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,130
it's all.
I think I saw Mark Marin,

405
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,310
some guy was tweeting to him like how
your podcasts fucking,

406
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,790
it ain't the tonight show or something.
And he,

407
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,530
he said something back to the guy,
you know,

408
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,780
it's just all media now.
And that's kind of how I look at it.

409
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,060
It's all fucking even where.
I mean,

410
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,100
I mean you guys are probably bigger
than,

411
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,420
you know what they quote unquote
mainstream media.

412
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:13,060
But it's to me it's just all,
it's all part of the same fucking thing.

413
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:13,841
Like,
yeah,

414
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:14,080
what's up

415
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,740
bigger and what's more popular as all
kinds of silly thing that's different is

416
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,190
that if you go to mainstream media,
if you go to television shows for the

417
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:24,370
most part,
you're not going to get 100 percent

418
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,450
dedicated audience.
You get.

419
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,100
People are just flipping through the
channels.

420
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,280
So some people might fall upon them
because they were looking for it.

421
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,160
But a whole lot of people I just going
to be flipping channels.

422
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,113
Like what's on

423
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,740
exactly.
And the people who listen to you,

424
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,680
like that's why the first pod,
I don't want this whole podcast to be a

425
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,900
review of the last one,
although I wouldn't mind because I had a

426
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,734
blast.
But

427
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,500
the whole,
when they tune into you,

428
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,000
they're like,
it's like it's your buddy,

429
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,580
if you say by the new Wheeler Walker Jr
record,

430
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:52,340
they fucking buy it by the new Wheeler
Walker Jr.

431
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:54,890
Record there that I said it.
They'Re going to buy it now.

432
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,873
can you?
Um,

433
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,550
it's called old.
Always lived by the way.

434
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,460
I just found out something that you guys
either you guys know about this.

435
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,510
I became a hit yesterday on some I never
heard of on black twitter.

436
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,250
You became a hit on black twitter.
Black twitter is a big fan of black

437
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:11,100
twitter.
So they,

438
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,530
he alerted me to black twItter.
I wasn't even aware of.

439
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:14,990
I didn't know.

440
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,150
BuT the more black people I can bring
any country music,

441
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:20,060
the happier I'm going to fucking be.
Terrence rutgers not bringing in a ton.

442
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,083
No,
no.

443
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,700
It's all white people.
Yeah.

444
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,950
Is it most of white girls to write?
Probably.

445
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:25,920
Yeah.
But no,

446
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm the king,
I'm the king of black country and I'll

447
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:29,240
say that loud.
Really?

448
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,350
Yeah.
So they took a clip from a um,

449
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,500
fuck you bitch from the first record and
some one of the big black twitter guys

450
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,720
put like a,
a clip of it.

451
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,090
And just at the top it's like,
I didn't know Country music went this

452
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:46,091
hard and so then it like got it got
millions and millions of views and all

453
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:49,890
of a sudden my.
Because now my new album,

454
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:52,230
oh wheeler,
but now is out.

455
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:56,010
And the first one's going back up the
fucking charts too because of black

456
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:59,160
twitter.
So we got white white people buying the

457
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,620
new one in black people buying the old
one.

458
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,120
Interesting.
Yeah.

459
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:04,860
Well who's this guy,
if you know blackboard,

460
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,680

day kwan tae,

461
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,230

Really big instagram accoUnt.

462
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:12,360
I'll pull it up for it.
And who is this fellow?

463
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,620
Is he fell.
It's a group of people like the fuck

464
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:18,060
jerry accounter.
Oh I have no idea.

465
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:20,460
But,
and then like a business definitely.

466
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,610
And then erica,
bad new fucking tweeted about it and she

467
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:26,010
said she's a big.
She's a singer.

468
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
She used to bake steering.
Rnb singer.

469
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,560
Yeah.
The biggest thing.

470
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:30,300
Or in the nineties,
a big singer.

471
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,170
The nineties.
Oh,

472
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,290
tyrone.
Tyrone tarlant.

473
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,450
I feel like I'm calling in from another
planet.

474
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,060
I had no idea what this fucking black
show today.

475
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,890
Yeah,
the black twitter

476
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,050
is fascinating to me.
I thought it was like a hashtag,

477
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:46,840
but it's not even a de quan.

478
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,080
9 million followers.
Wow.

479
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,741
Yeah,
go down.

480
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:51,630
You'll see it.
You'll see it down there somewhere.

481
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,760
And they posted a letter right there on
the right.

482
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,200
Yeah.
I never,

483
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,480
I never heard of a country district till
now.

484
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,790
a
2 million,

485
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,910
700,000 views.
That was in a few hours after being on

486
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:12,040
the road for a fucking year.
I should just talk to dave clark.

487
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,480
Well,
there's so mAny guys that have a youtube

488
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:20,510
accounts now to that.
They'll put up a video just talking

489
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:23,750
about something that just happened in
the news and they'll get 7 million

490
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,940
views.
That's crazy you say that because I am.

491
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,010
One of the guys I work with,
call me up and go,

492
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,030
who's jehovah?

493
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,020
They go see somebody in your video keeps
talking about jehovah.

494
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,460
And so I,
of course I look it up.

495
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,640
There's a guy playing wii.
He just fucking plays video games in his

496
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:44,090
parents basement and while he was
playing the video in the millions of

497
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,130
people watch while he's playing the
fucking video games,

498
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,890
he was singing my songs just along to
it.

499
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,760
And lIke the album started cell went
back up the charts and it's like,

500
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,020
that's the world we live in now is a
dude in his mom's basement singing,

501
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,660
sorry if you don't live in your mom's
basement jehovah.

502
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:02,090
But he probably doesn't.
He's probably making millions of dollars

503
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:03,920
playing video games.
It's crazy.

504
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:06,640
And then he calls me and then he,
he tweets me,

505
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,483
he goes,
um,

506
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,710
I always thought about doing a podcast.
He goes,

507
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,380
you mind if I just skype in and just do
one,

508
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,000
just try it out with you.
And I'm like,

509
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,430
that's where other artists would just be
like,

510
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:17,001
fuck that.
I go,

511
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:17,690
I'm home.
Just,

512
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,470
yeah,
let's do it.

513
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,920
So I went on his,
he posted an interview with me on his

514
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,650
youtube page and it just,
I don't know that it was huge,

515
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:26,470
but it was just like,
why am I not saying well?

516
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,520
I say no.
Just like,

517
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,280
yeah,
it's all.

518
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,450
It's like you said,
it's all fucking.

519
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:30,680
Even though,
yeah,

520
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,523
it's

521
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,840
might not even be.
Even guys like that pooty pie guy.

522
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,020
I don't know how much he's dropped off
since the nazi controversy,

523
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,760
but that guy was,
he has millions and millions of

524
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,260
downloads for every single thing he
does.

525
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,950
Like he might be above mainstream media.
I give you that.

526
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,860
I think that's one of the reasons why he
felt like they were going after and like

527
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,590
the wall street journal went after him,
was at the Washington post,

528
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,780
the wall street journal,
wall street journal.

529
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,930
Because both of them,
eventually they went after him and they

530
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:01,840
kinda made it seem like he was a nazi
sympathizer.

531
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,510
He was making a few inappropriate jokes.
what'd he say?

532
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,480
What'd he say?
He just joked around and did like a sieg

533
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:10,330
heil salute or something like that.
but he was apparently making fun of

534
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:13,840
people that were nazis making fun of the
idea of being nazis.

535
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,390
that's great.
That's been all been distorted and

536
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,560
twisted.
I agree with you.

537
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:21,850
I mean like I was like this new record.
I feel like there's people out there way

538
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,850
after you that are coming after me and
try to make sure I don't chart high,

539
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,010
which by the way I'm banned from all the
chains.

540
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,180
Are you really?
Yeah.

541
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,860
Best buy,
best buy.

542
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,450
Walmart.
Target.

543
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,280
Exactly.
Put.

544
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,250
The weird thing is country music fans
do.

545
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,720
And that really pissed me off.
Yeah.

546
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,310
And it was this other site,
pledge,

547
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,500
pledge,
pledge music where you can preorder

548
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,600
albums.
I was the first album they ever dropped.

549
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,150
So they're buying cds.
Still has led.

550
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:49,040
one of the few genres is still bought
cds,

551
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,850
genres of buy cds.
And so I can't compete wIth on the

552
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,670
charts as well because they're making
sure I don't go.

553
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,390
And I think honestly it's not just the
language that's bothering him,

554
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,980
it's the fact that I'm doing it outside
of this.

555
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,460
So thank you.
Can't go on rogan and joey diaz and you

556
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:06,760
know,
like we have a way that we do it,

557
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,880
we do it on the radio.
We'd go on fucking tonight show like

558
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:12,190
you're messing up.
Like it's all these guys in suits,

559
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,480
walking down music row in nashville.

560
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,270
Like you don't tell anyone that don't
tell anyone that nobody needs us or

561
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,780
you're going to fuck up our fucking
jobs.

562
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,760
But I think also they don't like that
you're,

563
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,580
I mean you're opening up the door for
people doing pretty much anything in

564
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:30,940
country music now with the crazy fucking
lyrics and the fact that it's been so

565
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:35,200
successful and you got people,
you got a whole goddamn theater filled.

566
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:40,030
thousands of people singing along to eat
and pussy and kick it as my favorite.

567
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,400
MY favorite one is when I go out and
tour and I see a sea of just like,

568
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,400
like do you know bros backwards,
baseball hats and all singing along

569
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:51,760
which one you queers going to suck my
dick and a singing every fucking word.

570
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,740
And for all I know I was going to call
them to make America gay too.

571
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:57,970
Or just because I think they're all
going home.

572
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,650
I think they.
I think they because they listen to

573
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:00,790
everything.
I think they're just going home and

574
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,980
blown each other.
Do you think that you have that kind of

575
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,650
power with a really good song?
Get a guy to go home?

576
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,110
I'll.
I mean if anyone can.

577
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:09,790
It's me because my songs are that
fucking good,

578
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,660
but I mean,
but there's.

579
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,120
But there's no way these dudes have ever
in their life screen.

580
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,400
Which one are you?
Queer is going to suck my dick and I

581
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:19,200
would imagine of fucking open
area.

582
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,550
So.
But along with a bunch of other people

583
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:22,750
doing it,
that's the thing.

584
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:24,010
Gives them freedom.
Yeah.

585
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:24,900
I think it's weird.
Yeah.

586
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,510
It's probably weird for their wives when
they go,

587
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,960
yeah,
what'd you do tonight?

588
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,810
We went out with 800 dudes and screamed
about blowing each other.

589
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,410
She'd go,
did you actually blow each other?

590
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,950
Like girls will find a loophole or.
no,

591
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,250
we didn't actually do it.
Okay.

592
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,310
Yeah.
I think I'm kind of hoping to get some

593
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,720
of the women back with this,
with this.

594
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,340
Do you think you lost a lot of them with
fuck you bitch?

595
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,060
No,
the women women's favorite song because

596
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,880
they,
I think they could sing it too.

597
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,120
They can see it from all three
perspectives way that they had that much

598
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,890
that they had that much.
Like for example,

599
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,120
the woman who made me write,
fuck you bitch had that much power over

600
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:07,640
me to make me write that.
DoeS she know who she is?

601
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,780
Um,
I think she does now unfortunately.

602
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:16,160
But um,
she laughs and I think she's honestly

603
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:17,960
upset and I've,
and I've had,

604
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,280
that's happened a couple times.
I've been,

605
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,230
I've been on some,
a po po.

606
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,370
Do you know this is new.

607
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,610
This is podcast I fucking love called.
I think you've talked about before.

608
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:30,260
two guys we fucked pod,
which is basically women talking about

609
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,910
women,
talking about dudes.

610
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,020
The way that guys talk about women and I
fucking love it.

611
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:37,230
And,
and it's,

612
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,590
it's the way women talk about men when
we're not around.

613
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:42,680
So it's like an eye opener for dudes,
but for some reason there's been no,

614
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,640
no one's really done that before.
And I was in New York to impress and

615
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,070
they'd reached out before they wanted to
use one of my songs and I was like,

616
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:49,511
well,
I'm out there.

617
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:50,450
I like,
can I stop by?

618
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,480
And of course I just start telling a
bunch of fucking stories than my phone

619
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:54,314
starts blowing up.
Like,

620
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,580
don't fucking know.
Don't tell him,

621
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,910
don't talk that shit.
And I got in a lot of trouble for that

622
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,210
one because you can't really go tell him
those kinds of stories on.

623
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,030
Because my thing was,
I didn't know that the podcast was that

624
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,480
fucking popular is.
Yeah,

625
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:10,010
they're very popular to a lot of.
A good example of what I use is like,

626
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,240
people always try to say that,
ah,

627
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:14,300
you can't start a new podcast and have
been successful today.

628
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:15,230
I'm like,
that's not true.

629
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,350
Those girls started that podcast just a
couple of years ago and fucking

630
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,330
gigantic.
Yes.

631
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,170
I mean,
I got a lot of fucking people talk.

632
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:22,640
I mean,
I've gotten a lot.

633
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,160
I lost some pussy over,
but I've gotten a lot of trouble.

634
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:25,911
That's.
Well,

635
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:28,850
don't forget I got a podcast to do.
Yeah.

636
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,800
When did you start doing that?
Uh,

637
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:34,760
like a month ago.
It's actually what's weird as it's

638
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:37,730
doing.
It was the number one music podcasts for

639
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:38,564
like a month.
And I,

640
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,750
and I,
and I'll even admit like the problem

641
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:45,350
with doing a podcast now,
and I kind of want your notes on this,

642
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:49,160
but the problem is with someone like me
who sells records is I didn't,

643
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,180
I don't get the months of
testing and you know,

644
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,130
it's like they hear it from everyone
listened to the first,

645
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,160
you know,
there's no way there's,

646
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,330
I can't experiment as much and I can't,
you know,

647
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,640
obviously what you're saying.

648
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,030
Yeah.
That's the case with us to our first

649
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,490
ones are terriBle.
But that was to him but.

650
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,670
But yeah,
but,

651
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,910
but it was probably before but it was at
least before he got huge.

652
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,601
Yeah,
yeah,

653
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:13,250
for sure.
But they're still available.

654
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,140
Like if people who I'm going to start
from the beginning,

655
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,300
they might get to episode three and go
fuck this dude.

656
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,370
Yeah.
I mean you were in the early days you

657
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,440
were doing just like straight to video,
right?

658
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,820
With like video effects and shit.
Like,

659
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:23,571
yeah,
sometimes,

660
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:25,640
yeah,
we had snow flakes in the background and

661
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:27,620
we'd do it right to a webcam.
I love it.

662
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,270
Yeah,
I mean it's been fun.

663
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:32,690
It's a cool way to just talk directly to
your people,

664
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,690
but
It's not my natural.

665
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,650
What happens is you had,
you had,

666
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:42,380
you talked to a good example about the
other day which is you just have

667
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,640
conversations like

668
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,660
I've been doing them all over the phone
because all the musicians I want to talk

669
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:50,930
to you on the road and when you do it
over the phone it becomes like an

670
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:54,050
interview and I don't want to interview.
I just want to talk to my friends,

671
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,030
um,
over the phone and over skype.

672
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,080
They're both weird.
I mean,

673
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:59,030
it's better than nothing.
Some people do well,

674
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,400
like sam harris does a good podcast over
skype,

675
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,070
but I think that it's,
uh,

676
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,270
it's just the lose something.
you want to be in the room with

677
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:07,970
somebody.
Burt was the one who told me that and

678
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,381
said like,
you know,

679
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:13,400
don't do it over the fucking phone.
And then I did one in person with a

680
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,340
singer.
I really liked it.

681
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,040
It was so much fucking bed.
We were just hanging out.

682
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,630
That's what,
that's what I like to listen to when I

683
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:20,330
was in a podcast,
his buddies hanging out,

684
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:21,164
you know?

685
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,040
So when you started touring from your
last album,

686
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,480
and it was this just out of the gate,
surprised,

687
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:34,190
smash hit took the whole country music
industry by storm.

688
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,370
What was that like?
Did you,

689
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,640
did it feel surreal because it seemed
surreal on the outside it felt it felt

690
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:45,050
surreal was because of my.
That's why it's this one so much

691
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:49,910
different and I kind of hate it.
There's expectations because what I left

692
00:27:49,911 --> 00:27:52,910
the studio on the first album with the.
I just paid cash for.

693
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:54,650
I think I told you I didn't have a
label.

694
00:27:54,651 --> 00:27:58,610
I didn't have any way to release It and
I was just like,

695
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,770
this is a great fucking record,
but it's a bummer.

696
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:03,590
No one's gonna hear it.
And I finally started getting it out

697
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:07,190
there and so then I really thought it
was going to just be like a cult record

698
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,340
and like I was gonna run into some do 10
years from now down the street.

699
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:11,174
Go,
you know,

700
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,570
I did the record,
but then when you know,

701
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:16,190
the guys who do the tours for me were
calling up like,

702
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:17,630
you're not going to fucking believe this
man.

703
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,630
We sold ouT,
you know,

704
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,490
you know la,
like the whole west with twitter for me

705
00:28:22,491 --> 00:28:25,640
is because it's so country to me.
It's like we did a west coast tour and

706
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,050
I'm like,
what the fuck we do in a west coast tour

707
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,810
for the whole west coast sold out.

708
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,200
It's like,
well how the fuck did I sell tickets and

709
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:35,270
seattle and portland.
That makes no fucking sense to me.

710
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,700
Like do they even know what country
music is there?

711
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:39,710
I think,
I think it's almost like they're looking

712
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:41,620
at me like in a glass cage,
like look at the,

713
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,110
look at the redneck in his natural
habitat kind of thing.

714
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:46,700
So I think they're just having fun,
man.

715
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,350
Well I think they're having fun.
I think it's that too.

716
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,950
I think they're also,
if there are a lot of people out there

717
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,790
who do love country music and if you
love it,

718
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,040
there's not much of it left anyway.
Not to mention.

719
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:58,490
Not much the price goes to seattle or
portland isn't there seemingly is some

720
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:02,420
sort of a resurgence though and like
really good country music seems like

721
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:04,070
there is.
It seems like there is a little bit,

722
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:08,170
you know,
know there's sturgill is,

723
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:08,950
you know,
the guy,

724
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,410
the guys who still aren't chris
stapleton stapleton.

725
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:12,244
Yeah.

726
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,220
Yeah.
I mean I definitely feel it too.

727
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:17,991
But then again,
you know,

728
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:19,650
there's,
there was an award show and there's like

729
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:22,290
a country music award show on like every
fucking week now.

730
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,420
Either really.
Well there's a lot.

731
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:26,940
There was one last night like for the
cmt awards,

732
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:28,340
like why are they even have
entrepreneurial,

733
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,330
just show fucking redneck reality shows.
What would the,

734
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:34,200
what would the cmt still country music
television because I think they're like

735
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,100
changing or something right onto
changing.

736
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:36,990
Like they're,
I think they're,

737
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,400
yeah.
They reached out to me about something

738
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,410
and I said,
I told them I wanted to host the top 20

739
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,730
countdown.
I got a hard pass on that.

740
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,370
I think they're like,
would you make fun of the artists?

741
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:46,500
I'm like,
if they're shitty.

742
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,560
Alright,
see You later.

743
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:50,770
Um,
he,

744
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,980
I feel like I'm real countries coming
back,

745
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:56,890
but I also feel like the shitty stuff is
getting bigger,

746
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,480
like they're at going at the same,
like it's not that pop bro country shit,

747
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:03,860
which I talked a lot about last time,
like the Georgia law.

748
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,640
Well there's a new,
there's a new song by thIs guy chris

749
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,930
janson called fix a drink that just came
out because now I'm looking at

750
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:10,270
everything that's coming out the same
week as mine.

751
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,000
The song fix a drink was,
it was the worst fucking thing I've ever

752
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:18,001
fucking heard of my fucking life.
It's this white guy just kinda wrapping

753
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,610
about like fox news and he sings about,
I can't fix the world,

754
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,650
but I can fix you a drink.
I'm like,

755
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:26,250
jesus fucking christ.
I mean it was doing well.

756
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,380
It's doing better than me.
There's a lot of mutants out there.

757
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,840
Yeah,
I mean there's a lot of.

758
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,530
I mean,
who the fuck would.

759
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:36,010
I mean,
even if you're not an expert music fan,

760
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:37,810
who would want to listen to a song about
fucking dude,

761
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:38,980
fix it.
A fucking drink.

762
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,300
A dude who wants to fix a drink,
a dude with limited use of his brain.

763
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,290
Exactly.
It's just like,

764
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,210
that's like his main.
That's like his main.

765
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,040
Um,
but to think about it there's,

766
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,530
we know there's a lot of fucking idiots,
right?

767
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,790
Think about how many People would just
double minded folks and then think about

768
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,080
how few people are talking directly to
them.

769
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,590
And then finally someone comes along and
does like finally,

770
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,611
finally.
Yeah.

771
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:05,611
Finally enough about life and you know,
enough sturgeon but life and like what

772
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,960
it's about.
Finally someone I can relate to,

773
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,300
just how much,
how much whiskey,

774
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,440
how much sour,
you know,

775
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,500
that's what I want to fucking hear it.
But some people just want life simple

776
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,360
down.
It isn't that sort of alwaYs been the

777
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:19,540
knock on country music in the beginning
because the country music would,

778
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:22,570
it does,
it sort of reinforces these stereotypes

779
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:26,350
of this simple step.
They tried to get me on that shit

780
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,810
Before.
I was just saying also I think they were

781
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:29,271
just like,
you know,

782
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:32,400
you're doIng like a,
you're like mocking redneck,

783
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,050
you know,
using a mocking like redneck shit.

784
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,850
And,
and all the crazy shit like fucking your

785
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:37,860
cat and like,
you know,

786
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,900
you know,
kIlling your dog and all that shit.

787
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,690
But I didn't think they got that.
I was just kind of making fun of my

788
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:44,530
buddies back,
you know,

789
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:47,200
like what the cliche of being a redneck
was.

790
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,840
You know,
and I still see it.

791
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,770
It's weird because we were talking about
the political shit,

792
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:52,960
like an snl.
There was a,

793
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,920
there was a sketch on snl near the end
of the season on,

794
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,960
you saw it,
but it was alec baldwin doing trump and

795
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:01,240
he was in a small town called union
kentucky's,

796
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:03,490
what they said,
which is actually not far from me.

797
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:07,510
And the whole
idea of the sketch was that this,

798
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,050
that um,
which I've been hearing a lot with,

799
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:15,550
these were these southern people who
were so dumb that they voted against

800
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:16,780
trump against their own interest.

801
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,370
Which I'm so sick of that fucking
narrative,

802
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,440
you know,
against their own interest.

803
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,760
How can they say that?
Well,

804
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:23,470
they're just saying that like,
there's a lot of,

805
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,150
there's been a lot of shit in the press
about how,

806
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,190
you know,
these old quote unquote southerners and

807
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:31,340
rednecks voted for trump,
but It's like they're the ones who work

808
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,260
there.
They're the ones who are going to lose

809
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:33,790
their health.
Aren't you even hear that a lot?

810
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,130
I don't know,
maybe it's just from my point of view,

811
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:37,960
but I found it very condescending to,
uh,

812
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,280
to,
and just,

813
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,110
you know,
I don't like the sketches.

814
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,130
It seems like,
you know,

815
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,020
like 50,
like in the foRties,

816
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:48,500
you know,
like some characterize Mr. Trump.

817
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:49,200
I got to,
you know,

818
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,240
that kind of shit.
You know,

819
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,420
I think people are nervous because the
same thing that you're saying when

820
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:59,990
you're talking about that there's no
mainstream media anymore and there's

821
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:02,660
just media.
When a guy like Donald Trump gets in

822
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:03,710
office,
it's,

823
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,240
it's changed what being a politician is
because now it seems like anybody can be

824
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,460
a politician.
Now we had a reality star that became

825
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:12,870
the president of United States law.
What?

826
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,420
You know,
what is this?

827
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,300
There's no real precedent.
Yeah.

828
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,280
There'S just a guy we have no control,
like we can't,

829
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,880
there's nothing we can control and we
can't stop non-politicians from being

830
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,930
president anymore and it seems like they
will be able.

831
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,570
They were able to do that for the
longest time.

832
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,130
Obviously.
There's a lot of other factors.

833
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,680
He's very rich.
He's very famous.

834
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,980
He handled a bunch of politicians for
many,

835
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:38,090
many years and paid them off and
understood and understood from behind

836
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:40,160
the scenes that going to be the next 20
presidents.

837
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:42,500
Are they all meet president?
kanye coming up.

838
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,330
Mark.
Mark cuban is the one they're talking

839
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,470
about,
but that is a good one.

840
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,610
He's.
He's rich.

841
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:47,990
He's on.
He's nice guy.

842
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:48,950
Smart.
Yeah.

843
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:50,720
I mean why not?
He'd be superior.

844
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,940
It's entirely possible.
He might do it.

845
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,710
Yeah.
I mean that's the one I keep hearing,

846
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:56,480
but yeah,
it could just be from now on.

847
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:58,730
You just buy the presidency.
Well,

848
00:33:58,731 --> 00:33:59,960
it could be.
I mean,

849
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,880
until we figure out that that's a dumb
idea,

850
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:05,930
that being a president is a dumb idea.
It's a dumb idea to have one person

851
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:09,620
running shit that just the fact that
trump has the ability to fire that call

852
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:11,870
me guys,
ridiculous that he could just say,

853
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,180
yeah,
I don't like what you're doing.

854
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,340
You're fired.
Like doesn't even have to have some like

855
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,830
rocks.
Like if you get fired from walmart,

856
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,970
they have to have a reason like you,
you can get fired from the fucking head

857
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:27,290
of the fbi and you just.
He doesn't like the fact that you're not

858
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,970
willing to drop it.
Investigation.

859
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,660
That seems like that seems insane.
The whole.

860
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,970
Yeah.
The whole thing is fucking like.

861
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:36,740
I mean,
there's nothing more you can say other

862
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,480
than that.
This guy was hosted a reality show.

863
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:42,020
Now he's president and I think that's
another thing that fucking scares people

864
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:43,490
about.
Oh,

865
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:47,960
we'll walker jr is country stars aren't
allowed to fucking talk about that shit.

866
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,280
You know,
you can't talk politics.

867
00:34:49,281 --> 00:34:52,290
You gotta you gotta fucking right man.
When the dixie chicks talked about joy

868
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,960
still killbuck go back.
Yeah,

869
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:56,060
they're done.
What happened with that?

870
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,120
They were essentially blackballed from
country music for years for saying that

871
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,960
they were against the war,
which by the way,

872
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:03,370
pr,
which,

873
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,830
which trump basically got elected,
you know,

874
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:09,320
he was,
he kept saying he was against that war

875
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:09,920
too.

876
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,330
So they like,
you know.

877
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,850
Well I think they said that he's an
embarrassment,

878
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,400
that they're embarrassed that George
Bush was the president.

879
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,770
I think it had more to do it.
They set it at a club in england,

880
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:21,620
so doing it out.
It's like you can't leave the country

881
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:24,830
and talk shit about american lawyers,
but if that was pop music,

882
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,180
that'd be super standard.
Like no big deal.

883
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
The weird thing,
I mean,

884
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,260
we grew up on like dylan and the beatles
and whatever,

885
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,570
hendrick people,
all they did was talk about that shit.

886
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,530
You know,
neil young,

887
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:38,040
it's like he,
his whole album

888
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,873
is just,
you know,

889
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,480
fuck this politician,
fuck this guy and you just can't do it

890
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:43,950
in country.
I don't know why that is.

891
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,821
Well,
it's the same thing.

892
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:49,821
We're talking about that simplified
narrative that these stereotypes of this

893
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,480
world where,
you know,

894
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:53,100
you go to bed and you get up in the
morning,

895
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,890
the birds chirping and you work hard all
day and you know,

896
00:35:55,891 --> 00:36:00,210
and everybody loves god and it's,
it's just this simple version of the

897
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:02,920
world that's boiled down to like,
there's,

898
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,380
there's things that are allowed inside
the simple version of the world and

899
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:10,380
there's things that are expected and
then there's things that are just not

900
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:13,740
discussed and you don't discuss sucking
dick and kicking ass.

901
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,371
Yeah.
I mean,

902
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:15,840
you're supposed to keep that to
yourself.

903
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,890
A sucking dick and kicking ass.
That's supposed to in any way moch the

904
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:21,701
president.
Well,

905
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:22,410
that's,
that's.

906
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,970
Yeah.
I mean that's the other thing too,

907
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:24,804
is uh,
you know,

908
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:29,810
my first single pussy king,
the first song is I put that out and I

909
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,980
got everyone got so pissed,
you know,

910
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,050
you can't be totally go and I send the
interviews.

911
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:35,550
I'm like,
I heard worse.

912
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:39,270
Talk about this on meet the press.
You know,

913
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,180
they show us all that.
Grab the pussy talk.

914
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,560
Yeah.
I'm not grabbing the pussy.

915
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:46,300
I'm just talking about how I'm going to
stick my dick in it if with with

916
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,440
consent,
you know,

917
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,530
I don't think I used to work consenting
the song,

918
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,760
but I think even grab them by the pussy
was implied consent because he was

919
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:58,230
saying they let you let you grab.
ThAt whole thing was so fucking weird

920
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:02,400
because it's like,
I hate to still be talking about it,

921
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:05,790
but it's like
I just found it funny.

922
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,770
I like it.
It didn't change my opinion of the guy

923
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:09,480
at all.
he knew was a scumbag.

924
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,750
I mean,
you knew him in whatever ways.

925
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,990
This is who he is.
I think part of it too is about you

926
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:16,710
guys.
But like,

927
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,900
I'd never heard that phrase before.
Grabbing by the,

928
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,560
you know,
it's like,

929
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,200
no.
Yeah,

930
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,170
that's somethIng i'd heard.
So it was new here.

931
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:24,330
I have a question for you guys.
I have a question for you.

932
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:25,740
What do you think?
Here's a theory I have,

933
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:28,740
which is,
do you think someone that trump

934
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:30,750
organization.
I've been wondering this for like a year

935
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:33,770
now,
secretly after that happened because he

936
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:35,940
smiled.
No doubt he's a smart businessman.

937
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,540
Copyrighted that phrase,
because you know for spring break from

938
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,800
now on,
there's going to be grabbing by the

939
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,100
pussy shirts for a little while.
You could sell it,

940
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:45,690
but I think that's kind of died off.

941
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,490
Those things have like a short shelf
life,

942
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,270
like those fidget spinners,
anybody making those fidget spinners.

943
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,270
Salesman as you can now because a year
from now no one's going to.

944
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,104
I don't even know.
Yeah.

945
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,880
Part of black twitter.
No,

946
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,240
no,
no.

947
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,580
It's a kids.
They have these little things and they

948
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:03,450
spit them and they hold them up on their
finger and they spin around in circles

949
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,380
and people really weird.
I'm like,

950
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,260
crazy.
Yeah.

951
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,090
I was looking at on the other day,
I was like,

952
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:11,670
how the fuck did this become a popular
item?

953
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,110
But it won't be for very long tonight.
You it?

954
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,431
Yeah.
I know.

955
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:16,170
I've seen those online.
Online.

956
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,770
Just these things spin or.
Yeah,

957
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,630
they're nuts.
I have done.

958
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,490
We've become just like watching shit
been around.

959
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,630
Yup.
Well,

960
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,990
there's another thing to do in this
anti-stress device that you hold onto

961
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,030
and it's got like switches on it and
buttons that don't do anything.

962
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:33,090
You just hit the switches and press
buttons and supposedly like if you hold

963
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:35,770
onto this thing were you stressed out
and start hitting switches and pressing

964
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,100
buttons.

965
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,933
You feel better.

966
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,430
Yeah.
I'm sure that works like a fucking

967
00:38:38,431 --> 00:38:40,050
child.
Um,

968
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,180
I think go back to let's just run
instead of either what we haven't even

969
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:44,640
mentioned,
but I think rick,

970
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:46,960
you're cut.
Uh,

971
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,030
I'm so fucking big now.
They're doing a fucking tv specials.

972
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,700
We have a guy here from showtime because
showtime special and they're doing the

973
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,450
recording my life and work and uh,
and uh,

974
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,110
you know,
it's weird for me to,

975
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,220
going to that they're making a tv
special about me,

976
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,450
but they let me do it on sensor not
telling the real story.

977
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:10,950
And I was like,
fuck it.

978
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:12,120
Just shoot it.
All right man.

979
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,570
But um,
they follow me around like that and I'll

980
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:17,130
do an interview in five minutes and I'll
just go get the fuck out of here.

981
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,690
Wow.
Said fucks up.

982
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,760
But he,
does he bring it up afterwards and go,

983
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,500
hey man,
the way he told me to fuck off,

984
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,420
that guy is really cool because uh,
the um,

985
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,970
the guys doing it,
um,

986
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,270
I don't know if I'm allowed to say his
name.

987
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:31,620
What's the piece part of the jackass
crew.

988
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:32,454
So he's,
he's,

989
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,293
he's,
um,

990
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,450
literally jet,
the show jack.

991
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,540
So like the fact that he,
there's no fucking goat ges and shit.

992
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:40,720
I'm sure he's just happy.
Yeah,

993
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,810
he's excited.
There's no explosions and also don't

994
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,280
forget he's working.
So anytime someone says,

995
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,450
fuck off,
he's off the clock.

996
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:46,284
So.
Oh,

997
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,400
there you go.
That's right.

998
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,410
So he gets to relax.
Yeah.

999
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,550
So,
uh,

1000
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,320
this showtime thing,
is it a,

1001
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,500
are they doing a showtime special?
Like you're going to play music on?

1002
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,320
Yeah.

1003
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
How much music is going to.
They've Been following me around forever

1004
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:02,300
and they're going to do like,
I don't know what the title be because

1005
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,920
like I said,
this is literally the first time I've

1006
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:06,880
ever mentioned on any sort of jesus.
It's a scoop.

1007
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,740
Yeah.
You got that rogan exclusive

1008
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,720
button.
You can press wish we had one

1009
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,800
follow me around for years and I'm not
years,

1010
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,610
but for a couple of years now and we've
got obviously I've been,

1011
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,250
we've got footage from the old days,
they're going to tell my whole life

1012
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:24,980
story and we'll get some songs in there
and you know,

1013
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,300
I was just psyched to be able to
hopefully took until it my way and not

1014
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,560
sick at all.
These fucking,

1015
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,580
all these lies and rumors,
lies and rumors.

1016
00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:35,120
Yeah,
I mean,

1017
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,500
yeah,
it was.

1018
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,940
It was weird too because that was
another thing too about combing today,

1019
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,100
which is komi.
He admitted,

1020
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,080
he's like,
they kept bringing up these New York

1021
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:42,950
times articles.
He's like,

1022
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:43,850
no,
that's not true.

1023
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,810
It's almost like backing up truck,
you know,

1024
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:49,190
these,
these stories.

1025
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,500
If the head of the fbi under oath saying
that these story,

1026
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:56,300
he said it's got a bunch of his trees.
It's like none hAd the fbi saying that

1027
00:40:56,301 --> 00:40:58,140
in New York times articles completely
untrue.

1028
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,500
I got to believe,
you know?

1029
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,580
Yeah.
There's definitely people that are

1030
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:06,581
printing things they hope are true with
limited mount of references that can

1031
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,483
verify it.

1032
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,203
Yeah.
It's like,

1033
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,080
and there's also two,
there's the stories that will sell

1034
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,033
newspapers.

1035
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,620
It's not just that.
It's also the bias of the people that

1036
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:18,840
are writing the stores who are heavily
left wing.

1037
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,610
You're really freaking me out with that
bottle.

1038
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,990
You keep opening and closing.
Yeah.

1039
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,280
This is still from.
This is from the airport.

1040
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:26,190
I'll be tweaking from.
Seems like you've got something going on

1041
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:27,900
with that opening and closing that
bottle.

1042
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,420
It's like I'm going to stop a fidget
thing.

1043
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,250
I got one of them fidget spinners.
Yeah.

1044
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,850
That's what it is.
A water bottles to get the stress

1045
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:39,890
relievers.
Wheeler walker water bottles.

1046
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,260
um,
what were we just talking about?

1047
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,500
A stress.
You're talking about New York times know

1048
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,350
the bias of the people who are writing
it.

1049
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,850
They want to get at trump.
So if they have any sort of an article

1050
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,260
that even might be true.
They kind of think might be true.

1051
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,630
It seems like it would be exciting if it
was true.

1052
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,060
They just run with it.
I thought that was interesting what he

1053
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,310
said actually,
which is like because it's highly

1054
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:06,160
classified information,
he's not allowed.

1055
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,380
He's not allowed to go out there and say
it's not true because that would,

1056
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,850
that would,
you know,

1057
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,420
sure would put them in a weird place of
the then you know,

1058
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,840
what top secret information isn't true,
so he has to keep quiet about it.

1059
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:19,910
So,
so when he's doing these interviews,

1060
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,631
uh,
and there,

1061
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:22,210
there are a rather,
um,

1062
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,910
when there is under investigation,
there's given these statements,

1063
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,200
how do they,
uh,

1064
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,730
justified then how does he say it's not
true because isn't that still top

1065
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:33,460
secret?
Because this is,

1066
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,090
you know,
he's under oath and they're asking him I

1067
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:39,140
guess is the only reason.
But there are definitely some questions

1068
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,010
where he said,
I'm not allowed to,

1069
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:41,750
you know,
I can't say that in an open hearing.

1070
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,340
Yeah,
that's what I figured was one of the

1071
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:46,550
reasons why trump could fire him because
he wouldn't be able to talk about the

1072
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:50,300
investigation until they hired a special
prosecutor and all this stuff that

1073
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,290
you're seeing now.
I would assume that people will like

1074
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,920
call comedy's going to talk.
I'm like,

1075
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,300
well,
he can't really talk.

1076
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,300
That'S one of the reasons why trump
could fire him because that guy is under

1077
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:02,470
oath and rather all the stuff that he's
talking about,

1078
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,000
what's he allowed to talk about now that
he's gone to st?

1079
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,620
That same rule.
it's top secret.

1080
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:08,930
Everything's top secret.
I bet he's not allowed to talk about his

1081
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,570
job at all.
I bet they could fire up not firing

1082
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,700
rather,
but they could arrest him if he.

1083
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,530
Because he admitted today that he.
He did.

1084
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,120
He admitted the leaks and stuff.
Yeah,

1085
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:18,520
but he leaks stuff that was
unclassified.

1086
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,190
He just leaked is memos.
They weren't classified and people were

1087
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:23,890
freaking out about it like no,
he,

1088
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,590
he did it because it was real simple.
He didn't want to be the one who was

1089
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:31,370
making the statement and the way he
described that he had a funny

1090
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:32,810
description.
He said it would be like feeding

1091
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:35,510
seagulls at the beach.
They would just follow them around and

1092
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,490
look for more.
And he was like,

1093
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,440
I just wanted to get the information out
there.

1094
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:44,441
So I had someone put it out there,
but he was honest about it and you know,

1095
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:49,100
it lets you understand that that's how
these people do business and this is one

1096
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:51,550
of the ways that information does get.
I think it's just.

1097
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,800
I think a lot of it is guys like a.
Wasn't a movie all the president's men.

1098
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,340
I think it's a lot of guys who think
that they're gonna.

1099
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,840
If they get the scoop,
they're going to have a hit book and

1100
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:01,020
then they're like,
you know,

1101
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,730
brad pitt's going to play them in the
fucking movie.

1102
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,470
If they get this fucking scoop.
Well there's also that.

1103
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:09,590
but then there's just,
if you're an investigative journalist

1104
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:12,050
and you're covering the president,
United States and this unprecedented

1105
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:16,460
event where reality stars become the
fucking president and he's a liar and he

1106
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:19,280
just keeps lying about shit and getting
caught lying about shit.

1107
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,230
And there's a bunch of people that don't
care that he's a lIar.

1108
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:24,680
He's like everybody loves and they just
jump on in with it and you don't expect

1109
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:29,210
a higher standard of behavior from the
number one most influential person in

1110
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:31,230
the free world.
You know,

1111
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:35,250
he's still tweeting about like,
people that suck in people who get

1112
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:37,200
terrible ratings.
CrazY shit.

1113
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:38,040
I mean like,
uh,

1114
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,530
I mean,
I'll never forget it.

1115
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,500
I remember Watching the republican,
one of them was public in debates and

1116
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,590
he,
he talked about how fat rosie o'donnell

1117
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:47,460
was.
I was like,

1118
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,460
can we do all the debates like this?
I fucking love this,

1119
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:51,690
you know,
like a roast debate.

1120
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,810
Like how the fuck even rosie o'donnell
is gonna be sitting there like,

1121
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,710
why are they talking about my weight on
rosie o'donnell's decided to dedicate

1122
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:00,660
most of our twitter feed to shitting on
trump.

1123
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:02,370
Now she's losing her marbles.
Man.

1124
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,730
What about kathy griffin to that scene?
That was fucking.

1125
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,500
What did you think about that when you
saw her?

1126
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,940
Kathy griffin holding up that fake head
of Donald Trump covered in blood.

1127
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,650
What did you think?
Well,

1128
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,240
maybe my all I think is how fucking,
how fucking badly do you need fucking

1129
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:18,330
attention?
You know,

1130
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,070
it was like,
I mean,

1131
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,600
exactly.
What did you think?

1132
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:23,520
best case scenario like,
right.

1133
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,890
I think if,
if,

1134
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,790
if that's your.
If your viewpoint,

1135
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:31,791
is that what you want to presidents,
I mean just to twist it,

1136
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,030
imagine ted nugent holding up obama's
head like it's overdue.

1137
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:38,640
Well,
ted nugent did at one point in time say

1138
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:40,890
he wanted obama to suck on his machine
gun.

1139
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,330
He did say that words or less powerful
in that image.

1140
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:47,460
I guess I heard a picture's worth a
thousand words.

1141
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:48,800
That's what they're saying.
No,

1142
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,220
that's what they're saying.
Oh shit.

1143
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:50,631
Well,
I didn't know.

1144
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:52,050
Is that.
I didn't know he's gotten that big.

1145
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,060
Yeah.
Maybe more than a thousand.

1146
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:56,640
If it's a picture of what was it for?
I don't.

1147
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,100
I never found out.
She's just doing it to get attention.

1148
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,110
That's what it was.
Sticking around the house and just like,

1149
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:03,540
I'm going to hold up.
He had a photographer come over and the

1150
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:08,541
photographer setup thing and you know,
they covered this mask with blood and

1151
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:10,860
she held it up like she was isis.

1152
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,420
I mean,
this is not,

1153
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,110
you're not talKing about teens and that
medieval France.

1154
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:16,741
That's.
I mean,

1155
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:19,380
that's just a sign of a fucking idiot.
You know?

1156
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:22,680
It's like,
not only if that's your viewpoinT,

1157
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,610
you gotta be smart enough to know that
that's only going to hurt your,

1158
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,080
your where you're coming from.
Not only that,

1159
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:31,080
she did this press conference in paint
herself out to be a victim.

1160
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,860
She's seen he's a bully and he's trying
to ruin her career.

1161
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,520
And then she was like celebrating the
kind of comedy she does.

1162
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:39,780
She was like,
you know,

1163
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,030
I've always pusheD the boundaries and
um,

1164
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:42,571
uh,
you know,

1165
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:43,710
my comedy is,
you know,

1166
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,000
it's not for everybody,
but it's,

1167
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:50,220
she was like,
like relishing the moment to express how

1168
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:54,250
she feels about her comedy or two to
sort of describe comedy.

1169
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,100
And it's not a free speech thing.
I mean,

1170
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,350
no one's saying she didn't have the
right to do it.

1171
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,110
We're just all saying it's fucking,
it's fucking lame.

1172
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,580
You know,
it's an attention thing.

1173
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,620
It's all,
it's purely an attention thing to the

1174
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:08,560
point where there's no,
there's no entertainment value to it.

1175
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:13,790
Like it's one thing if you have some
ridiculous idea in your head that is

1176
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,070
funny or is entertaining.
That's what I'm saying.

1177
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,810
What was the best case scenario?
There's no,

1178
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,250
there was nothing,
no thought.

1179
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:21,300
It was just like,
let's do this.

1180
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:22,134
People are gonna.
See it.

1181
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,520
Well,
the only funny part for me was that like

1182
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,020
mike,
who does all the photoshopping for joey

1183
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:29,010
diaz,
I don't know if you know him.

1184
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,040
He's been

1185
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,130
helping me with some photoshop and the
second I saw that picture I go do me a

1186
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,160
favor,
put my head on kathy griffin's head and

1187
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:41,161
change trump to sam hunt and he fucking
didn't five minutes and it looks pretty

1188
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,890
good and I put it up.
So then I loved how some of the people

1189
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:46,270
thought I was like,
actually once I was like,

1190
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:46,541
no,
no.

1191
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,490
It's a comment on the fucking kathy
griffin.

1192
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,610
I didn't hear about the kathy griffin
thing until I saw her apology.

1193
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,790
That's how I found out about it.
I found out about it through her apology

1194
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:59,791
on instagram and so I was clicking on
this video and it was her apology and

1195
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:02,830
she looked like hell.
So literally she hadn't slept and she

1196
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:05,650
was freaking out as opposed to when she
looked awesome as opposed to when she

1197
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:06,450
looks hot as fuck.

1198
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,690
Yeah,
that's good.

1199
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:10,590
Photoshop right there,

1200
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,310
it's perfect.
Your,

1201
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,470
your head sits perfectly on her neck.
It's weird.

1202
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,940
Yeah,
I pairs perfectly.

1203
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:18,920
My,
my beard and her beard look exactly the

1204
00:48:18,921 --> 00:48:20,270
same.
I don't think she has a beard dude.

1205
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,330
But um,
I saw the apology and just,

1206
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,990
I was like,
what did she do?

1207
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,730
Like she was like,
I went too far.

1208
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:29,930
I went too far,
you know,

1209
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,770
I'm sorry,
I've,

1210
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,570
I've seen the comments.
I went too far.

1211
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,780
I apologize.
I'm a comedian and sometimes we go too

1212
00:48:35,781 --> 00:48:36,910
far.
I was like,

1213
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:40,010
what the fuck did she do?
And then I went and saw what she did and

1214
00:48:40,011 --> 00:48:40,844
I was like,
oh,

1215
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,570
I wonder.
I'm trying to think.

1216
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,330
Have you,
have you heard anybody even in the

1217
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:49,980
comment,
if you heard anybody defending her?

1218
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:50,660
Yes.

1219
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,020
Who you have to say,
I don't remember their names,

1220
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:57,950
but it was a,
it was a defense of the intent behind

1221
00:48:57,951 --> 00:48:59,090
it,
which I agree with.

1222
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,950
The intent behind it,
meaning,

1223
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:04,370
which she was trying to do is be funny.
She was trying to get some attention.

1224
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,870
She was trying to.
It's like a joke that you do that fall

1225
00:49:06,871 --> 00:49:08,390
short,
like here's a perfect example.

1226
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,300
Bill maher's joke.
Did you hear what he said?

1227
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:11,780
Yeah,
yeah.

1228
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,050
Yeah.
So if people haven't heard the senator

1229
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:18,060
from Nebraska was a senator.
Got damn.

1230
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,250
That's fucking voice upon the senator
from Nebraska I believe.

1231
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,480
Said you should come visit.
We can have you work in the fields.

1232
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,970
And bill threw his hands up and go,
not me.

1233
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:31,010
I'm a house nigger.
That's what he said.

1234
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:33,200
And everybody was like,
what the fuck?

1235
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,200
Like what makes you think you could say
that?

1236
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,000
And when he did a hbo released a
statement,

1237
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:44,690
they were pissed off and there was a
fire bill maher,

1238
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,180
twitter hashtag thing going on.

1239
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,511
That one,
don't you think?

1240
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:51,480
To me is it is a little more least.
I understand the intent of his joke.

1241
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:52,950
Yeah.
He was trying to be naughty.

1242
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,330
Yeah.
He made a mistake.

1243
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,373
Look,
pete,

1244
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,280
here's,
here's the thing.

1245
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,580
He's working on a show.
Okay.

1246
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:02,070
He's working on a very important show
for hbo.

1247
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,880
That is a very high profile show.
This is extreme amount of pressure,

1248
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,670
extreme amount of demands.
There's a lot going on behind the

1249
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:10,890
scenes.
He's probably working very hard.

1250
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:15,660
He's probably tired and he's in the
middle of this interview and he's trying

1251
00:50:15,661 --> 00:50:18,450
to make something entertainment.
The guy gives him an opportunity,

1252
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:20,310
right?
The guy says you could work in the

1253
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:22,420
fields and he's thinking work in the
fields for him to work with.

1254
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,770
I know who works in the fields,
slaves working the fields.

1255
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,310
Who's the guy that's in the house?
I'm going to say this,

1256
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:31,520
and he just goes with it to try to be
shocking because he's,

1257
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:33,440
you know,
he tries to be that naughty,

1258
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,690
edgy guy and it just was.

1259
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,500
It was lame and it wasn't funny.
Yeah.

1260
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:42,020
I get more pissed when I watched.
When I see his shows,

1261
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,320
it seems like he's.
When he makes a joke and they don't,

1262
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,330
he gets mad when they don't want to
fucking left.

1263
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:49,130
That's the part that bothers.
He's a silly boy.

1264
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,290
But when,
when he,

1265
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:55,520
when he made a joke and it was lame,
he was just trying to be funny.

1266
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,800
Like he was trying to entertain people.
It's important to him.

1267
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,620
His show's important to him.
It's a very good show.

1268
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,580
He works hard at it and most of the
jokes are really funny and there's a lot

1269
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:07,520
of edgy,
controversial jokes on the bill maher

1270
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:11,660
show that are really funny and he.
That's the line he pushes in.

1271
00:51:11,661 --> 00:51:13,880
Sometimes you cross that line and he
crossed that line.

1272
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,860
Is he racist?
Fuck no.

1273
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,240
Is he a bad guy?

1274
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,290
No,
no.

1275
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,830
He was a fucking mistake.
He's a human being.

1276
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,770
It wasn't like the n word slipped out
talking derogatory about,

1277
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,900
you know,
he was trying to exact point about

1278
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,210
slavery.
It was just trying to be silly.

1279
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:30,470
He was trying to be funny.
He was like,

1280
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,150
he's not like being.
Remember when dog,

1281
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:35,960
the bounty hunter got caught dropping a
bunch of bombs about people.

1282
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:37,400
There's,
there's a way.

1283
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,070
Look,
there's no words that are forbidden and

1284
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:45,071
the idea that the.
That's that word exists in countless rap

1285
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:48,320
songs,
but you can't sing along to those rap

1286
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:50,350
songs and yet ransom,
walmart.

1287
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,030
It's ridiculous.
I think those rap songs are banned from

1288
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:55,310
walmart too though.
You and I found out recently,

1289
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:59,780
which is those.
There's walmart versions of all those

1290
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:00,620
jobs.
I didn't know that.

1291
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,200
Oh,
where they take out the cuss words.

1292
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,350
Yes.
I mean I know that I fucking ordered a,

1293
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,380
an itunes once,
a copy of a,

1294
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:11,090
one of the dead,
not dead presidents.

1295
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:16,880
Who the fuck was.
It was one of those hardcore rap bands

1296
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,810
and as I was listening to it,
it was all this backwards fit.

1297
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:21,201
Yeah.
No,

1298
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:25,720
like bleeped out or like it was like
empty spots where there was the,

1299
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,480
I,
I downloaded a m and m album.

1300
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,090
I heard all these backwards sounds.
I thought it was like,

1301
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,770
you know,
the old sergeant pepper shit.

1302
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,830
I guess they took it out the bad words
and just played them backyard even

1303
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:39,770
worse.
I listened to one from gangstarr and

1304
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:42,500
they had alternative words,
alternative words,

1305
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,120
and I was like,
oh no,

1306
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:49,330
you can't have alternate world star hip
hop guys like jay z or some big I go

1307
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,670
fuck this way and doing this anymore.
I think they're not doing it anymore,

1308
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:54,230
but the reason why they do this for
money,

1309
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:55,730
there's so much money out there.
I mean,

1310
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:58,760
if they can get their shit played on
radio and get the more.

1311
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,350
It's all about exposure.
I mean,

1312
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:02,660
you know,
it's all about the most amount of people

1313
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:04,070
that you could reach with your stuff.
Yeah.

1314
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:06,020
Well they asked me to do a clean
version.

1315
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,310
I said no,
good for you.

1316
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:08,800
But my,
my,

1317
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:11,900
um,
my morals definitely cost is going to

1318
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:15,140
cost me a lot of fucking can.
I don't think so.

1319
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,380
I think in the long run it'll save you
money because it'll,

1320
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,790
it'll elongate your career because if
someone's a fan of yours and they're at

1321
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:25,220
a barbecue and someone pulls out the
lame version,

1322
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:25,621
like,
oh,

1323
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,070
you gotta hear

1324
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,540
this guy,
he's fucking hilarious.

1325
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,760
This guy's crazy.
And then it's like,

1326
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,910
f you bitch,
f you b,

1327
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,850
you broke my heart.
Screw you girl.

1328
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:39,630
Or well remember when cee lo green had
that?

1329
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,130
Forget you.
No,

1330
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:42,781
no,
no,

1331
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:43,614
no,
no.

1332
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,240
Forget you.
It's fuck you.

1333
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,240
And why the song again?
Why can't he say fuck you on the radio?

1334
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:48,901
Doesn't mean nice.
I mean,

1335
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:50,250
I know why,
but yeah,

1336
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,460
it's like,
it's stupid because a long time ago

1337
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:58,170
people were dumb and they thought that
the son was 17 miles away and they

1338
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:00,240
thought there was an old man living in
the clouds,

1339
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,080
had friends that used harps and that,
uh,

1340
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,470
you gotta be careful with words are
clinging onto the,

1341
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:09,030
I mean the same thing.
And like tv and radio,

1342
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:10,150
they're like,
they're still like.

1343
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,880
But like,
it's like there's,

1344
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,020
there's youtube,
like,

1345
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,193
you know,
we did it.

1346
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,610
We,
we,

1347
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,600
we premiered another video from this
record again.

1348
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:20,520
We did the pornhub premier,
you know,

1349
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:21,960
like,
fuck this,

1350
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:23,730
let's reach the people fuck up.
Yeah.

1351
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:26,010
You premiered on pornhub,
which is hilarious.

1352
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,740
How did that come about?
I reached,

1353
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:29,640
I,
uh,

1354
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,830
what happened was people were just kind
of like,

1355
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:34,470
you know,
like let's find a place to premier,

1356
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,640
you know,
they always do this thing where like,

1357
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:37,650
you can premiere a video on like,
I don't know,

1358
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,050
will it be an example like a v club or
some shit,

1359
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:40,884
you know,
and,

1360
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,350
and we're rolling stone or something
like that.

1361
00:54:42,351 --> 00:54:43,320
Give me those numbers.
You know,

1362
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,060
it's like so and so gets 50,000.
We're like,

1363
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,040
well,
what about lookup pornhub's numbers?

1364
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,010
It was like 200 something million.
I think one of the,

1365
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,820
I think we're rolling stone with
something like the $8,000 or something.

1366
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:57,320
Biggest website and I go check out what
pornhub is in porn.

1367
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,980
I was like,
number 19 in the world,

1368
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,473
and I go,
well I go,

1369
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,070
I go,
let's just reach out to them and see if

1370
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:04,230
they'll premiere.
It will be the first guy to premier

1371
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:06,930
country music video on pornhub.
The problem is when people go to

1372
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:09,600
pornhub,
they're sweaty and nervous and they're

1373
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:13,410
just thinking about beating off.
Well to get in the wrong mindset.

1374
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,330
Well I think,
I think after you beat off,

1375
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,880
you ready to fucking chill out and
listen to some good country.

1376
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,560
Yeah.
But you're also really ready to hide

1377
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:23,610
what website you were watching on your
browser and erasing your history.

1378
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,080
It fucking worked,
man.

1379
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:26,970
I mean,
I've seen,

1380
00:55:26,971 --> 00:55:28,380
I saw a lot of people,
you know,

1381
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:30,630
like uh,
I don't know how many people I could

1382
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:32,840
tell you that came up to me like a first
heard about you because they don't want

1383
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:33,674
to admit it,
you know,

1384
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,800
but the numbers show that people
fucking,

1385
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:39,930
it was crazy because we,
we premiered it on pornhub and they're

1386
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,400
like,
it was almost like,

1387
00:55:41,401 --> 00:55:42,930
you know,
if you guys do this for me,

1388
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,670
I'll show that,
you know,

1389
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,440
it worked in a cell.

1390
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,270
You can sell things besides fucking
boner pills,

1391
00:55:48,271 --> 00:55:49,104
you know?
Right.

1392
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,071
Well,
it's also,

1393
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:53,850
it's one of the things that if you did
it just knowing that you did it,

1394
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,860
people would go there to check it out.
Like he's,

1395
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,710
he's premier to shit on pornhub.
Exactly.

1396
00:55:58,711 --> 00:55:59,880
Yeah.
Go there to check it out.

1397
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,170
And it's funny because we put it up at
like noon or something and I was like,

1398
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,560
I thought it was like hundreds of
millions of views aren't that high and

1399
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:10,800
someone there was like,
wait till 5:00 when people get off work

1400
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:11,760
and stop beating off.
Yeah.

1401
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:14,220
It was like 5:00.
The numbers fucking just shot through

1402
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:16,890
the roof.
It's like once that fucking work,

1403
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:18,960
bell rang.
It's like they were fucking.

1404
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,820
Yeah.
People get in trouble for beating off at

1405
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:21,654
work.
Right.

1406
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,470
You can get fired.
Yeah.

1407
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:25,210
It's a bummer.
I wish there was like a section.

1408
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,950
There is no country music section of
pornhub you think there would be due to

1409
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,780
just be the wheeler walker section down
is I,

1410
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:36,780
I got to figure out how to because I set
up my own channel to um,

1411
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,240
to printer that video and I got to
figure how to turn it off.

1412
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,710
I get alerts on my phone every two
minutes so and so clicked like on your

1413
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:49,510
pornhub video or so and so like from
like left a comment on your porno

1414
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,640
videos.
Like I gotta get that shit off.

1415
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,080
It's all day.
It's like I wake up until the night to

1416
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,280
and it's just.
And it's like,

1417
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,114
um,
you know,

1418
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,630
trump jazz,
44 gigs.

1419
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,281
Your,
your,

1420
00:57:02,281 --> 00:57:03,250
uh,
your new,

1421
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:05,200
your new song.
Did you ever look at some of the

1422
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:08,080
comments on,
on porn website videos when they start

1423
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,890
rating videos and describing.
I know that's how I know what to fucking

1424
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:12,724
watch.
Yeah.

1425
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,740
Yeah.
Well the star system is pretty good.

1426
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,670
When you get to the actual words,
you start feeling real uncomfortable.

1427
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,580
What were you expecting?
Yeah,

1428
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,230
I didn't like kosher wind.
Wind,

1429
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,340
wind rows.
Huh?

1430
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,160
Jesus.
Yeah.

1431
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:29,440
Like sometimes you'll go on there and
you'll see the first thing.

1432
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,200
She was like,
don't watch this one fucking finished.

1433
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,090
He finished insider.
You can't see shit,

1434
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,740
man.
Thanks for the heads up.

1435
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,810
You know jesus christ.
People get mad.

1436
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,850
They think it's fake.
It's fake calming.

1437
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,553
Like,
wow.

1438
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,970
That's weird.
Yeah.

1439
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:43,990
The,
I believe in fake news.

1440
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:46,720
I don't believe in fate come.
There's definitely fake come.

1441
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,320
I've seen it.
Seemed fake dicks should seen one.

1442
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:54,220
He always has sex with his pants on
because he's got a big fake rubber dick

1443
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,400
and uh,
it has a button in it where he could

1444
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:00,910
just.
Eddie presses the button and it comes

1445
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:01,631
out.
It looks like,

1446
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:03,160
um,
what's that set of?

1447
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:06,220
Filled at the face lotion that people
use.

1448
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:09,010
What's that?
No,

1449
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:09,461
no,
no.

1450
00:58:09,461 --> 00:58:13,390
That's for zits set of like that face
soap.

1451
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,350
It's kinda like.
Yeah,

1452
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:16,900
I was looking.
I saw one of those two and then right

1453
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:18,760
before he just,
it was like a hard cut.

1454
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,800
Like if you'd like,
you can tell that they filled up the

1455
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,590
fake dick machine to pump it up.
Don't book book book.

1456
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,740
Get it to the,
to the top.

1457
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:29,250
I wish I could sit here honestly sat in
jack off to that one.

1458
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,050
Wow.
Now,

1459
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,760
um,
do you think you're going to have more

1460
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:37,000
songs that come out on pornhub or is
that a one time thing?

1461
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,490
Um,
what about you?

1462
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,320
Does he ever thought about going to one
of the other competitors websites?

1463
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,270
Deal?
Some company called perth city gave me

1464
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:48,720
a,
a free membership per vociti.

1465
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,100
He had never even heard of him,
but it did look in to get through your

1466
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:52,450
webcam.
That's what they're looking to do.

1467
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,710
I think they were looking for me to
mention on your show and I just felt

1468
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,470
like,
oh fuck,

1469
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,270
I didn't mean to.
Sorry god it.

1470
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,610
Um,
but they got their money's worth I

1471
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:01,421
guess.
But yeah,

1472
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:03,190
I think if I could do only point,
I mean,

1473
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:08,000
cmt ain't gonna fucking play it.
So now they won't even play one of your

1474
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,330
songs.
How many songs do you have?

1475
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,040
Like with no swearing?
Zero.

1476
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:16,600
I'm just rounding off there.
But would you,

1477
00:59:16,601 --> 00:59:17,950
uh,
you know,

1478
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:21,440
what's weird too is um,
so I got one of my new tunes,

1479
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:26,540
it sorts of definitely an american thing
because I just have the cmt of

1480
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:27,530
Australia,
whatever it is.

1481
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,430
My out,
my,

1482
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:33,440
one of my new songs from the new record
is like in heavy rotation there and this

1483
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:34,320
thing about,
you know,

1484
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:38,660
a stretched out pussy and shit in it.
And they play in regular rotation.

1485
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:40,880
I guess they're just Australia.
They don't give a fuck.

1486
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,640
They don't give a fuck in Australia.
They're savages.

1487
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:48,260
Those people that are descendants of
prisoners and they're just freer over

1488
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:50,600
there and that they,
I didn't even send them the video.

1489
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:52,460
I think they took,
took it off youtube and just put it on

1490
00:59:52,461 --> 00:59:55,070
fucking tv now they're,
they're pretty bad ass.

1491
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:57,650
And Australia legalized prostitution.
Really?

1492
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:00,200
Oh yeah.
They wanted me to come over and do some

1493
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,260
shows and I'm like,
that's a long fucking long trip.

1494
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:04,400
But you would sell out over there.

1495
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:08,270
But here's the thing that weeds illegal.
They're really so backwards.

1496
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,490
You can sing about a stretched out
posting on tv and weeds.

1497
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:14,000
Illegal,
crazy legalized prostitution.

1498
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:17,870
No,
we'd soon do you think because I keep

1499
01:00:17,871 --> 01:00:19,850
looking at,
I think weed's going to change big

1500
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,781
Kentucky,
you know,

1501
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:25,040
my home state is the place where I think
it will be the most because I know a lot

1502
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:28,730
tobacco farmer friends of mine whose
families are in the tobacco farm

1503
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:31,430
business,
which is like they need this.

1504
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,590
They need that shit right now.
They would make,

1505
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,100
they could get their business back and I
don't know why it's not legal there.

1506
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,170
It's renewable.
It's very easy.

1507
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:44,290
It doesn't reQuire much in terms of like
resources so less pervious and I seeing.

1508
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,570
I'm seeing the tide change.
Every time you go home you see more and

1509
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:50,990
more
legalized from like more and more

1510
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:52,820
businessmen and shit in town,
you know?

1511
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,380
Yeah.
Because it would Really help the

1512
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:56,390
economy.
Well it's also people realize it's

1513
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:57,860
stupid.
It's stupid.

1514
01:00:57,861 --> 01:01:00,230
Just like making whiskey,
illegals stupid.

1515
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,900
It was dumb.
They figured that out in the 19 twenties

1516
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:07,700
and the fact that here we are in 2017,
then they haven't completely embraced

1517
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:09,080
it.
That's one of the things that pissed me

1518
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:12,530
off about this jeff sessions guy.
Like what a giant step backwards that

1519
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:15,320
asshole is coming back with wanting to
bring back.

1520
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:19,190
Just say no and say these aren't good
people.

1521
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,020
It's basically what's the.
What's that crazy movie?

1522
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:24,230
It was basically idiocracy now what's
the crazy we'd movie from.

1523
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,000
Oh yeah,
I'll reformat.

1524
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,100
Reefer madness was.
He was like acting like that.

1525
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,250
It's like he's just a guy who doesn't
smoke pot and probably never has and

1526
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:34,490
doesn't even know what it does.
HIs idea of it is like people doing math

1527
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:35,870
or sniffing glue or something.

1528
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,030
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Yeah.

1529
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:40,820
It's fucking pisses me off too.
It's just like,

1530
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:41,841
well,
it's also,

1531
01:01:41,841 --> 01:01:44,870
there's a lot of money involved.
I mean these guys are all whores.

1532
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:46,550
You gotta,
you gotta pay attention to like who's

1533
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:50,570
buttering their bread and there's a lot
of people that have very strict agenda

1534
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:52,250
and if you go out there and start
talking about,

1535
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:53,720
look,
that's one of the things that piss me

1536
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:55,400
off about hillary clinton more than
anything.

1537
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,210
She gAve some sort of a speech and in
that speech she said that she was

1538
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:04,190
absolutely in every sense of the word
against marijuana legalization will fuck

1539
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:05,030
you.
Old lady.

1540
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:07,280
She also said she also said she was
against.

1541
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,310
She wanted flag burning to be illegal.
Right.

1542
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,600
She was also against gay marriage until
2007 or 2013.

1543
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,490
Yeah.
They just want to forget things about

1544
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,810
what they used to think.

1545
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,160
When you just say the word democrat,
that you're like,

1546
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,500
we believe in these things.
Their,

1547
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,320
their opinions aren't real.
They're opinions.

1548
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:30,270
Are there strategic sort of a
conglomeration of ideas that they think

1549
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:32,640
are going to serve them?
Well when they go out In public,

1550
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:35,370
that's wHat their opinion.
They forget that it's 2017 and

1551
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:36,930
everything.
There's a record of fucking everything.

1552
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:37,381
Yeah.
I mean,

1553
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:40,170
I was getting pissed because there were
a couple of weak companies who wanted to

1554
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:43,740
sponsor some of my tour,
but it's too complicated right now

1555
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:46,410
because how different states,
like it could be like I could get

1556
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:49,380
arrested in certain states just for just
for advertising advertising,

1557
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:50,310
which is crazy.
LIke,

1558
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:51,900
so I couldn't put it on a tour bus or
anything.

1559
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,490
So there's no way to really do it right
now.

1560
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,440
Yeah.
And you also become a target in the

1561
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:59,520
states where it's very illegal where
cops have been arresting people for a

1562
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:00,120
long time.

1563
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,620
You've got them trained to arrest
people.

1564
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,270
Then all of a sudden you tell them they
can't.

1565
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,333
I'm like,
what?

1566
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,090
Well,
it's legal now.

1567
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:08,100
Like what?
Fuck that.

1568
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:10,890
Like there's guys that still want to
arrest people out here,

1569
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,120
out here.
I mean there's,

1570
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,520
there's still arrested or taken place,
uh,

1571
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,750
in,
in other states,

1572
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,270
but it's so fucking dc for,
for instance,

1573
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,310
Washington dc.
Marijuana is legal.

1574
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,740
People are still getting arrested for it
and they don't.

1575
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:23,581
They don't spread that around.
How?

1576
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:25,290
Because I didn't even know that black
people.

1577
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,570
It's not white people getting arrested
For it.

1578
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,250
It's black people,
black twitter.

1579
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,360
Yeah.
Well they,

1580
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,270
you know,
it's a reason that they can arrest you.

1581
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,320
They could find a reason to arrest you
and look,

1582
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,990
there's a lot of gross shit that goes
along with law enforcement,

1583
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:44,640
but one of the grossest ones of these
fucking people have requirements for how

1584
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:46,170
many people they're supposed to arrest.

1585
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,230
They have quotas are supposed to be
making or how many people they pull off,

1586
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,140
pull over how many tickets they write.
You know,

1587
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,390
there's been a long time.
Yeah.

1588
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,320
Yeah.
You're the wrong guy.

1589
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:58,920
The wrong time or you know,
the cop Just decides he's going to

1590
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:03,330
arrest you for it because it's federally
illegal and you just make a call.

1591
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:06,310
I know it's not good.
Yeah.

1592
01:04:06,311 --> 01:04:07,550
Me,
if it's fucked up that you couldn't,

1593
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,810
you know,
I can have a tour bus with like,

1594
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:11,490
you know,
you know,

1595
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:14,820
bourbon on the side and go across the
country and back and that's fine.

1596
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:17,460
But which yOu can advertise on the
fuckIng road.

1597
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:18,540
Work and kill people.
Yeah.

1598
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:22,300
My friend ron white,
he runs around a giant truck that has,

1599
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,870
is um,
number one tequila on it.

1600
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,930
He's got a huge bus,
huge ass tour bus,

1601
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:31,610
which says number one,
tequila on the side of the bus.

1602
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,360
Yeah,
they probably pay them good money and I

1603
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:34,980
was like,
this is his company.

1604
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:35,821
Okay.
Yeah.

1605
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:38,760
I was fucking excited about some fucking
marijuana money.

1606
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:40,620
Like let's help me out.
Get a nice bus.

1607
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,900
Yeah.
People have asked me to partner up with

1608
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:45,960
them or to get involved and I'm like an
eight at the time yet.

1609
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,823
Yeah,
you're.

1610
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,050
I agree you'd Be.
You'd be target number one.

1611
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:52,500
It's just,
it's worth it financially,

1612
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:55,950
but it's not worth in terms of like the
mental mortgage that you have to pay to

1613
01:04:55,951 --> 01:04:58,110
be involved with something that's
illegal.

1614
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,920
I've always wondered about that.
Like I always wondered like,

1615
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:02,400
you know,
like snoop dogg's on tour,

1616
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:03,840
if you see,
see snoop dogg's bus,

1617
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:05,250
why wouldn't the cut?
They do.

1618
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,230
They do all the time.
Oh,

1619
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,490
he's been pulled over before.
He's been arrested before.

1620
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:11,010
it's weird to just be that adamant about
it.

1621
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,230
You know what?
After Willie Nelson,

1622
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,060
you don't have to fucking really?
No.

1623
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:16,800
Here's the thing though,
like if you're,

1624
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:21,160
if you're A stoner and known stoner,
all you have to do is just know somEbody

1625
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:23,410
in a town like you don't have to travel
with it,

1626
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,190
like traveling with it as stupid,
like people that get busted with weed,

1627
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:28,570
like don't,
you know there's a weed where you're

1628
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:29,800
going.
But yeah,

1629
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:32,760
I don't think I've gotten off stage once
and there hasn't been a joint ready for

1630
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,060
me,
for somebody that I've never even met.

1631
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:35,470
Yeah,
there's always something.

1632
01:05:35,471 --> 01:05:37,630
But the thing is,
do you smoke that weed?

1633
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,630
Um,
I usually do,

1634
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:42,640
but I would say don't do it every
couple.

1635
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:45,400
Every once in a while I'll smoke it and
then later that night I'm like,

1636
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:46,640
something don't feel right.
You know,

1637
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,790
people are going hardcore,
people are going hardcore.

1638
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:55,450
Some dude was telling me about this
spray that he invented.

1639
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,480
That's an acid spray.
It's lsd in spray form and he goes,

1640
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:06,340
just as many pumps as you take off of
this spray is how deep you go into

1641
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,450
alice's rabbit hole.
What jesus christ.

1642
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:12,390
Did you see that?
There's a new documentary that's

1643
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:15,460
execucare just talking to him.
His documentary out,

1644
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:16,900
that's pretty good.
I don't actually.

1645
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,840
I'm not a big grateful dead fan,
but there's a documentary out now about

1646
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:22,810
them that feels like it's pretty crazy
watching them in the old fucking days.

1647
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,520
I lacked the grateful dead dead jean.
I'm with you like I don't get it.

1648
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:29,020
I watched this to try to get into it,
but it was.

1649
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,870
The acid tests they were doing back then
were fucking crazy.

1650
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:33,640
they would.
They would dose the fucking record

1651
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:35,260
company dudes.
Yeah.

1652
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:38,380
Well people just dose people back then,
which is one of the things I think is

1653
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:39,640
we're seeing a dick move.

1654
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,230
Well,
I think one of the things we're seeing

1655
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:44,410
with his bill cosby thing,
I think people had a different opinion

1656
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:48,610
about dosing people.
I think bill cosby was amongst a group

1657
01:06:48,611 --> 01:06:51,820
of many people that we're dosing people.
Back then,

1658
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:56,170
I think it was super common thing.
I think it was super common because they

1659
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:58,290
joked around about it.
You know,

1660
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:03,300
bill cosby had a whole routine about
giving people spanish fly and he's joked

1661
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:07,420
around about dosing people.
What the tv Show he did.

1662
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:09,820
He did a routine on someone's late night
talk show.

1663
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,950
Oh,
I saw that was Larry King too,

1664
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:13,870
and it's dark and he talks about
spanish.

1665
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,810
He talks about spanish finance and larry
king's or laughing as I would've because

1666
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:17,920
I would've thought he was dicking
around.

1667
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,050
You would've thought he waS joking
around and then when you find out,

1668
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,040
I just think all those old dudes,
he used to go to the playboy mansion and

1669
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:26,710
hook up and you know,
meet all these young ladies that were

1670
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:27,800
very happy to see them.

1671
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,810
And I think they were dosing actually
actually sixties and the second you say

1672
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:33,410
that to girls when I take them out and
if the,

1673
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:35,950
if I go to the bar and get a drink and
we'll come back with two drinks is like,

1674
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,920
how do you usually do this?
Because I'm cool.

1675
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,800
But like how do you,
how do you know?

1676
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:42,660
Oh yeah.
I don't know.

1677
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:43,380
You should go,
you know,

1678
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,040
actually you shouldn't be dRiNking this,
you know?

1679
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,090
Yeah.
I,

1680
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:49,180
well I won't take a drink if I don't
know who it is and someone just hands it

1681
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:54,181
to my you where that happens a lot too.
They'll put shots on the stage and then

1682
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:56,350
they'll call me a pussy for not
drinking.

1683
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:57,760
I didn't drink.
I don't know you,

1684
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,540
But I know people.
I know people perSonally that had been

1685
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,190
drugged.
I know.

1686
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,560
I know several people that had been
drugged.

1687
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:10,450
It's not uncommon at all.
Hunt for tattooed woman who drugged and

1688
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:15,451
robbed too wealthy men of $200,000 worth
the cash of watches after them at

1689
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:16,370

hollywood nightclub.
Wow.

1691
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:22,160
The woman twentY met two men at a
hollywood nightclub on March 5th.

1692
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,740
She wenT with them to an apartment in
studio city,

1693
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:26,720

Men say they passed out,

1694
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,730
woke up hours later,
but she had gone.

1695
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:31,310
They claimed $200,000 where the watches

1696

Shut up.
YOu guys were doing.

1700
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,800
You were pimping on a budget,

You got lucky.
You lucky you're alive.

1704
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:54,020
You're lucky he didn't wake up in a
bathtub filled with ice or the big

1705
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:56,450

1709
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,380
I want to.
It's almost like,

1710
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,290
it's almost like you almost want to like
even me,

1711
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:11,510
it's a cool,
but like you totally see where she's

1712
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:14,310

drug and people man.

1717
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:32,440
Like it's a very dark,
dark thing to do though.

1718
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:34,420
Honestly.
All jOkes aside,

1719
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,730
it's pretty fucking evil.
Yeah.

1720
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:38,290
Put something in their drink and watch
it affect them.

1721
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:40,420
Like a lab rat,
like,

01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,310
the people that's happened to like,
I want to maybe not even high school or

1724
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:47,320

ninth grade and someone dosed you and

1729
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:59,050
you had like the worst fucking day of
your,

1730
01:09:59,051 --> 01:10:01,290
of your fucking life.

1738
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:17,140
There's this new thing that government
says,

1739
01:10:17,141 --> 01:10:19,450

We don't really know what it does.

1740
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,040
So It go.
So here's your assignment.

1741
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,440
We're going to split you up into groups
of two.

1742
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:28,770
One of you takes this and the other one
has to do a report on how he reacts to

1743
01:10:29,081 --> 01:10:30,190

Want some weed.

1744
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,800
And I'm good.
I got show night,

1745
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:35,890

You do your show sober.

1746
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,690
I do my show,
I drink a little bit,

1747
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,760
but I can't do if I get stoned.
I forgot all the lyrics.

1748
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,280
Really.
I forget who's fucking who and who's

1749
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,150
working who off,
you know,

1750
01:10:42,151 --> 01:10:44,290
it's like a specific,
you know,

1751
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,640
it's very critical.
Yeah.

1752
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,700
It's like I need to know that rita is
blowing this dude and I get it.

1753
01:10:48,701 --> 01:10:51,160
It's all the names.
You don't have to explain to me.

1754
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:53,710
You've been there.
But yeah.

1755
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:57,390
And they actually led to the lawsuit
about what,

1756
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,020
how,
when you weren't allowed that you

1757
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:03,850
weren't allowed to a
test drugs on students?

1758
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:04,773
Oh yeah.

1759
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,710
But he didn't know they did that to um,
the ins,

1760
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:10,010
the unabomber,
the unabomber.

1761
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:11,980
Ted kaczynski was a part of the harvard
ellis

1762
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:14,400
experiments.
No way.

1763
01:11:14,401 --> 01:11:15,350
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

1764
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,670
Yeah.
I'm doing what to dosing him up.

1765
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:20,820
They toast the shIt out of that because
then they originally think of some kind

1766
01:11:20,821 --> 01:11:23,250
of truth serum.
Maybe they didn't know what it was.

1767
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:26,040
So they were trying to figure out,
well I will Albert Hoffman and figured

1768
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:26,581
it out.
Right.

1769
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:29,190
He,
he accidentally discovered it.

1770
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:32,760
I think he was coming up with a drug to
induce labor.

1771
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:38,030
I think that was the original premise
behind creating lsd and he got some of

1772
01:11:38,641 --> 01:11:42,540
it in his hands and then on his drive
home through absorption through the

1773
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:44,730
skin,
he was tripping as fucking balls off

1774
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:48,270
riding his bike.
That's the whole story behind the

1775
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:52,560
understanding of lsd as a psychoactive
substance and human beings.

1776
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,600
So they started doing all sorts of
studies.

1777
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:58,200
There's some videos from the,
I believe it was the british army.

1778
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,800
They dose their their soldiers up and
they filmed them and they're running

1779
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:04,710
around laughing and giggling and they
can't do anything.

1780
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,390
It's like a black and white footage
from,

1781
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,910
I want to say like the fifties.
Yeah.

1782
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:12,540
There was a lot of that crazy footage in
that because I don't think,

1783
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:15,570
I mean it's hard to say because it's
obviously influenced a lot of great

1784
01:12:15,571 --> 01:12:17,750
fucking music,
but also they were like,

1785
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:21,760
they were so taken so much acid.
There was a part in the movie where the

1786
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,940
drummer for the grateful dead was
telling the record company guy.

1787
01:12:23,941 --> 01:12:26,820
He goes,
I alwaYs love these kind of drugged out

1788
01:12:26,821 --> 01:12:27,960
hippie stories.
This guy goes,

1789
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,220
he goes,
we want to take a microphone and we want

1790
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:32,640
to record the small,
you know,

1791
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:36,660
like we wouldn't go out to the desert
where there's clean air and record clean

1792
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:38,850
air and put the two sounds together.

1793
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:42,060
That's our,
that'll be a rhythm track that's a lot

1794
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:44,280
of acid and to take.
And they wanted that to be the drum

1795
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:47,670
track and some guy at warner brothers
records into suits.

1796
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:50,580
Like,
what the fuck are you talking dead jean?

1797
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:54,480
I don't have that gene.
I feel like if you could play the dead

1798
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:59,820
to like a young fan of rap music that
like never,

1799
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,740
never heard the dead like a young black
dude just like sit him down like,

1800
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:06,270
tell me what you think about this.
They'd be like,

1801
01:13:06,271 --> 01:13:08,790
what the fuck is this?
That's how I feel.

1802
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,080
Yeah,
just don't get it.

1803
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,080
It just sounds to me like,
again,

1804
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:17,430
like a bunch of drugged out hippies just
noodling around when you're on acid at

1805
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:18,720
the show.
it's amazing.

1806
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:21,870
I've heard people say that I was never a
fan of the grateful dead until I saw

1807
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:22,280
them when,
um,

1808
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,770
when I was on acid,
I'm more than willing to agree to that

1809
01:13:25,771 --> 01:13:30,180
because there's some songs that I've
heard when I was tripping that like you

1810
01:13:30,181 --> 01:13:31,020
go,
oh,

1811
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:32,190
now I understand.

1812
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,400
I remember the first time I got stone
her and black sabbath and I remember

1813
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,250
saying to my friend like,
other people who listen to this without

1814
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,143
being stoned,
like,

1815
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,430
what does it sound like if you're like,
what's the point?

1816
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,990
What's the point of fucking black
sabbath?

1817
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:44,760
if you're not stone,
it doesn't even make sense to me,

1818
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:48,210
but you have a black sabbatH to me.
I can still listen to even not stolen.

1819
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,400
They've got some bright jams.
I just,

1820
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:54,330
there's something about the sort of
hippie nature of the grateful dead

1821
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:55,920
people too.
I was always like,

1822
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:57,480
well,
you just running away from life.

1823
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:00,910
Go get a job.
You stinky fucks fucking dirty here.

1824
01:14:00,911 --> 01:14:03,640
But then my own cousin became a dead
head for awhile.

1825
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,810
She's cool.
She traveled with the dead for years and

1826
01:14:06,811 --> 01:14:08,370
she was like,
one of those people that lived out of

1827
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:09,900
the back of a vw band,
they would,

1828
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,010
they would go to a store and buy bacon
and

1829
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,970
eggs and cook them up for the people
that were in the,

1830
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,030
in the concert,
and then they would sell them and shit.

1831
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,640
And that's how they got by that sell
bracelets and shit.

1832
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,210
Like she lived like that for man.
I want to say it was more than a year

1833
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:23,500
she traveled around with the dead.

1834
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:25,550
Yeah.
I mean it was kind of because they,

1835
01:14:25,551 --> 01:14:26,960
they,
they had a big kind of country

1836
01:14:26,961 --> 01:14:28,970
influenced what they did according to
the documentary.

1837
01:14:28,971 --> 01:14:30,100
I'm like,
well,

1838
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:31,310
I don't fucking hear it.
You know,

1839
01:14:31,311 --> 01:14:33,620
it's like,
I love the idea that they were making

1840
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:35,380
kind of trippy kind of country,
but it's like,

1841
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,070
that's not what I'm hearing in my ear.

1842
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,330
Yeah,
I get it.

1843
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:43,220
I get it if you're into that music,
but I feel like that's like food,

1844
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,580
you know,
there's certain people that I just know,

1845
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:47,240
like my friend tom,
I have a friend,

1846
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,300
not to girl tommy.
Hey tommy,

1847
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:53,360
shout out child to tommy.
He's a buddy of mine that I've always

1848
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:56,960
been a fan of spicy food.
I can eat some fucking spicy food.

1849
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:59,660
I go deep,
but not nearly as deep as this

1850
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,390
motherfucker.
There's some dudes that I think that

1851
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,940
they,
their taste buds are just wired

1852
01:15:04,941 --> 01:15:07,970
different.
They can just take in a different level

1853
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:09,930
of spice than I can.
Like I,

1854
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:13,790
it must be affecting their body
differently and I know for me like I

1855
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,680
have friends that don't like anything
spicy.

1856
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:18,890
I don't always say shit just doesn't get
to them.

1857
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:20,030
To me,
I love it man.

1858
01:15:20,031 --> 01:15:22,910
I eat jalapenos pretty much every day of
the week.

1859
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,400
I'm always,
I put hot sauce on everything.

1860
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:27,380
I'm putting a habanero sauce on
everything,

1861
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,510
but some people it just doesn't

1862
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:32,540
work with only thing I can say.
I tried these shots of like super.

1863
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:35,570
It was like there's some little shot you
can take.

1864
01:15:35,571 --> 01:15:37,640
I thought it was coming down with
something on the road once and they gave

1865
01:15:37,641 --> 01:15:41,900
me this super is something like filled
with vitamins and had some kind of

1866
01:15:41,901 --> 01:15:43,190
pepper.
It was supposed to help me.

1867
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,180
Oh,
okay.

1868
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,310
Tie in and it hurt.
It hurt,

1869
01:15:46,311 --> 01:15:47,780
but it fucking helps.
That definitely helps.

1870
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,840
Yeah.
I wonder what the real sciences behind

1871
01:15:49,841 --> 01:15:52,000
cayenne pepper,
but they always like to add it to those

1872
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:54,610
wellness shots to make you feel like
it's doing something.

1873
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,230
It gives you a little woo.
It opens up.

1874
01:15:56,231 --> 01:15:59,110
You're not studying the way they market
it.

1875
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:01,800
Yeah,
I mean you feel great right after you

1876
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:05,130
get the shot done because you're just.
You're just kind of like,

1877
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:06,350
can't believe you got it down.

1878
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,880
There was this place that we went to.
The doesn't exist anymore.

1879
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:13,020
There was an encino is called chili my
soul and it was a chilly place that had

1880
01:16:13,021 --> 01:16:16,740
levels of chili like from mild all the
way up to like.

1881
01:16:16,741 --> 01:16:20,310
I think I forget what their system was.
It was the x system or a number system.

1882
01:16:20,311 --> 01:16:24,120
I think it was a number system and I
think the top was like 10 and one day I

1883
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,840
tried an eight and they would give you a
sample and it was like the size of

1884
01:16:27,841 --> 01:16:29,940
those.
You know those little paper cups that

1885
01:16:29,941 --> 01:16:32,540
you get like at a hamburger joint.
These are supposed to fill up a catch up

1886
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:36,510
like it was that small,
a tiny little thimble full of.

1887
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,540
I was like,
this is so little.

1888
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:41,220
Just try it,
just try for a sample and I put that

1889
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,980
fucking tiny spoon in like an ice cream
spoon,

1890
01:16:43,981 --> 01:16:47,730
like a sample spoon.
I put it on my tongue and I just started

1891
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:52,850
sneezing and hiccuping out of control.
Snot was pouring down my nose.

1892
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,200
I couldn't believe how fucking hot it
was.

1893
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,340
And that was just an eight.

1894
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,100
I remember thinking I had one of those.
No,

1895
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:00,780
not probably not that hard.
I remember thinking like I'm never going

1896
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:03,470
to recover like my mouth was burning and
I remember sitting on the toilet just

1897
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:04,870
like,
I was like,

1898
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,800
I was like apologizing to my asshole for
what I'd done to it.

1899
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:08,780
It's like,
you know,

1900
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:10,430
it was like,
it was just a [inaudible] attack,

1901
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,720
man.
That's why I worried about,

1902
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:12,740
especially on the road,
like,

1903
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,080
you know,
I could see how like,

1904
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:17,720
you know,
like a big bank and go eat the wrong

1905
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:19,010
thing,
get up there and fucking shit your

1906
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:19,701
pants.
Oh,

1907
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,620
for sure.
There's also something about really

1908
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:24,170
spicy food that makes your shit just
want to get out of your body

1909
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,250
immediately.
Oh no.

1910
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:25,730
Yeah,
it was.

1911
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:27,830
It was like if,
if someone had been in that stall at

1912
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:30,110
that restaurant that in this particular
case I'm talking about,

1913
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:33,650
it would have.
I would've fucking toward through my

1914
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:35,810
fucking shit.
I was going to shit,

1915
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,180
no matter what.
That's that shit in the sink or the

1916
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,490
garbage can.
Which way would you go?

1917
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,010
Honestly,
I think at that point I would have just

1918
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:44,390
probably those shit.
Your pants.

1919
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,111
No,
I would have taken.

1920
01:17:45,111 --> 01:17:46,330
I didn't.
I probably wouldn't want to ruin,

1921
01:17:46,331 --> 01:17:46,910
ruin my pants.

1922
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,130
I probably would have just pulled them
down.

1923
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:51,470
Just shit like on the fucking bathroom
floor.

1924
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,780
I'll bet you think it's hard to.
It's hard to know.

1925
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:56,180
I mean,
what's the move though was if you want

1926
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:58,250
to be like,
I bet there'd be a lot of arguments.

1927
01:17:58,251 --> 01:17:59,630
I probably would have gone to the
urinal.

1928
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,430
Really?
Shit in the urinal.

1929
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:02,390
That's rough.
Well,

1930
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:04,280
if a guys got to clean that,
yeah,

1931
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:06,290
we'll do offer to clean it.
Fuck no,

1932
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:07,124
but I wouldn't.
I wouldn't.

1933
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,020
I don't think I would have,
um,

1934
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,650
you know,
we wouldn't have been too nice to do it

1935
01:18:11,651 --> 01:18:12,540
on the fucking floor.
Yeah.

1936
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:15,410
That's one of the rare things about
going to a public place,

1937
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:16,820
like a restaurant or something like
that.

1938
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,830
You're not,
you shit all over the place.

1939
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:19,760
You don't go,
hey man,

1940
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:20,840
you've got to clean that.
And you're like,

1941
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:21,674
no,
I don't.

1942
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:23,900
It's funny.
Before I ever hit the road,

1943
01:18:23,901 --> 01:18:25,800
I was talking to some other weird.
Yeah,

1944
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,450
some,
some,

1945
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,800
some other musicians.
They were just like,

1946
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:29,650
the main thing about the road is,
and you may be,

1947
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,740
you know,
is like finding a good place to.

1948
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,410
It's all about finding good places and
I'm like,

1949
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,350
I put my heart and soul into these
records.

1950
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:37,790
Like it's just gotta be more to it than
that,

1951
01:18:37,791 --> 01:18:39,290
you know,
what support people they've already

1952
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:41,390
given up,
but they've just given up on their

1953
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,250
dreams.
Play drums on the road.

1954
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,690
Yeah,
exactly what they're just talking about,

1955
01:18:44,691 --> 01:18:45,470
how like,
you know,

1956
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,240
taking will.
If you're in this town,

1957
01:18:47,241 --> 01:18:48,730
there's this one restaurant that
doesn't,

1958
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:50,600
that doesn't check you make sure you're
eating.

1959
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:52,810
They're like,
there's like a,

1960
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,653
there's like a,
you know,

1961
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,820
they give me the fucking toilet tour of
America.

1962
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:57,091
I'm like,
you know,

1963
01:18:57,091 --> 01:18:58,820
if that's my biggest problem,
it'll be fine.

1964
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:02,510
There's something about shitting and a
past the bathroom at a gas station

1965
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:04,880
that's actually kind of satisfying.
It's like,

1966
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:05,870
yeah,
it's disgusting,

1967
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:08,440
but you're not going to ruin it.
You took a terrible dumping.

1968
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,890
That bathroom.
We just liked this one.

1969
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:13,520
I'm here for.
Or a park when you go to a park and they

1970
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:16,400
have those stainless steel toilets that
don't even have a lid and you just sit

1971
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:20,300
down on it.
You gotta wipe all the piss off at first

1972
01:19:20,301 --> 01:19:21,230
before you sit down.
Yeah.

1973
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:23,510
Those risks,
those rest stop bathrooms are pretty

1974
01:19:23,511 --> 01:19:24,344
nice.

1975
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,410
Some of those up myself.
Yeah,

1976
01:19:27,411 --> 01:19:30,020
you can mess them up.
It's a weird thing that that's where

1977
01:19:30,021 --> 01:19:34,540
dudes chose to go to get together when
they were gay and in hiding like

1978
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:36,620
throughout the fifties in the sixties
and seventies.

1979
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:38,120
That was like the thing,
you know,

1980
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:42,320
they'd go to get rest stops.
That was like a who's a hacky joke in

1981
01:19:42,321 --> 01:19:45,620
the early days of standup comedy and
I've got a new song.

1982
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:50,630
Yeah guys meeting.
I should sell my album that wrist and

1983
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,760
you'd probably sell some for sure.
Truckers are one of the few people that

1984
01:19:55,761 --> 01:19:57,860
definitely still have cd players.
Oh yeah.

1985
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,140
They probably have vhs still.
I've got a lot.

1986
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,610
I definitely have a lot of truck or
faint,

1987
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,530
you know jeff,
like meet people after the show was

1988
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:03,861
like,
you know,

1989
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:06,750
I drove fucking 36 hours or whatever,
you know,

1990
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:09,840
can we do to shout out to the truckers?

1991
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,660
Yeah.
There's a lot of people out there just.

1992
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,800
I mean,
you're stuck in a truck for fucking 12

1993
01:20:13,801 --> 01:20:15,240
hours.
You need some god damn content.

1994
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,343
Totally.
I mean,

1995
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,950
I don't know how you do without like.
I think some of those guys don't know

1996
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:22,740
technology that well,
but without having access to podcasts or

1997
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,740
fucking spotify that shit.
Well,

1998
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,910
how would you feel?
You'd be amazed.

1999
01:20:26,911 --> 01:20:31,050
I think truck drivers are more in tune
with that kind of technology,

2000
01:20:31,051 --> 01:20:33,990
like entertainment technology that they
can't take in while they're driving than

2001
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:36,480
anybody.
What does that jamie still luxury

2002
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:39,060
sleeper cab for a long haul truck.
Oh wow.

2003
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:40,910
It's a god damn apartment.
That's what I see.

2004
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,220
That's what I need to get that big.
That's like a camper.

2005
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:48,300
Holy shit.
Well that's cool for him man.

2006
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,820
So he just goes back there when he's
done.

2007
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,810
Oh,
there's the thing.

2008
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,330
He goes,
everybody's got a coffee machine there

2009
01:20:54,331 --> 01:20:55,440
and shit.
I can live in there.

2010
01:20:55,441 --> 01:20:56,720
Yeah.
One of my buddy's got one of those with

2011
01:20:56,721 --> 01:20:58,800
a shower in it too.
You ain't got a magazine thing,

2012
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,701
but you know,
still the rule.

2013
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:02,940
You can't shit in it no matter what.
You're not supposed to shit in those

2014
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:03,541
things,
however.

2015
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:04,820
Nice it is.
Well,

2016
01:21:04,821 --> 01:21:06,750
people do it though.
They wreck those things.

2017
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

2018
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:09,210
There's um,
there's,

2019
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,340
I mean it's still,
it's a sucky job for those poor

2020
01:21:11,341 --> 01:21:12,290
bastards.
And they get off.

2021
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:16,110
They all get fucked up backs.
You're sitting in a chair all day.

2022
01:21:16,111 --> 01:21:19,470
They need to get these ergonomic chairs
for driving a car.

2023
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:20,710
That's what they need.
Right?

2024
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:24,150
And hemorrhoids.
Hey ergo depot,

2025
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:27,440
I got fucking task for you.
How about you guys figured out

2026
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,950
replacement car seats?

2027
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:32,110
Does that make sense?
Yeah,

2028
01:21:32,111 --> 01:21:33,360
it does.
You could sit in this,

2029
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,210
this and driving cars that keep you
straight up.

2030
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,910
There's tons of like cushions and weird
shit you can buy for them.

2031
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:39,753
Yeah,
there are.

2032
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:42,700
They say the lumbar things,
the big one because it makes you,

2033
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:45,730
it forces your body to say straight
instead of that like hump thing.

2034
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,830
He was going to say there's probably
uncomfortable shit that's probably good

2035
01:21:47,831 --> 01:21:49,210
for you.
That makes your back.

2036
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,370
Yeah.
Well you're supposed to sit like this.

2037
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:54,810
It's supposed to sit straight up.
That's why they say like those balance

2038
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,650
balls are really good.
Like sitting on balance.

2039
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:59,140
Paul's are good because you kind of have
to sit up straight.

2040
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,880
Yeah.
A lot of guitars have a lot of back

2041
01:22:00,881 --> 01:22:02,620
problems because you know,
you put it on it and it's.

2042
01:22:02,621 --> 01:22:06,160
And it's not really that heavy,
but just a little bit of weight every

2043
01:22:06,161 --> 01:22:07,840
night of your fucking life,
you know,

2044
01:22:07,841 --> 01:22:10,060
after 30 years we'll start to get to you
a little bit.

2045
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,980
That makes sense.
That makes sense.

2046
01:22:11,981 --> 01:22:15,490
I feel that same place.
I feel like people that wear backpacks

2047
01:22:15,491 --> 01:22:16,400
probably the same thing.
Right?

2048
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:20,590
It's pulling on you to slowly but surely
a women with purses.

2049
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:24,040
They say women with big tits.
You wouldn't think that tits would fuck

2050
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:25,170
your backup.
Oh yeah.

2051
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,400
It happens a lot.
I know people who have had a breast

2052
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:29,960
reductions because it's helped their
bed.

2053
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:33,050
I new girl had one in.
That's another thing too.

2054
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:36,850
Like when you're a funeral,
what's that sort of funeral for her old

2055
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,670
tits.
Did you know,

2056
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:41,170
because I was definitely bummed.
But um,

2057
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:42,550
but for her she's like,
probably like,

2058
01:22:42,551 --> 01:22:43,770
god damn it.
It was,

2059
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,680
it was,
it was always.

2060
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:48,550
She was always like a pain in the ass.
Like I get these fucking giant things.

2061
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,110
Giant jugs.
Yeah.

2062
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,210
Yeah.
It's probably annoying as hell.

2063
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,433
I got it.

2064
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,480
Imagine if your dick was so heavy.
Dark curtain.

2065
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:58,040
What do you mean?
Imagine?

2066
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:02,210
I mean imagine your dick that have no
fucking way.

2067
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,170
No,
I was good.

2068
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,830
Try it.
Like the surgical thing.

2069
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:08,110
I was like the whole what?
I'm going to try to start a rumor here

2070
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,670
that my dick's too heavy.
I and I got to.

2071
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,850
We rolled around in the wheelchair to my
shows that,

2072
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:14,170
well,
who's the guy that they sent out the

2073
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:16,750
giant hog dolton.
Burl would say,

2074
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:20,590
milton berle just whip his hog out just
to settle everybody the fuck down,

2075
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:24,430
talking to a bunch of shit.
And milton milton berle,

2076
01:23:24,431 --> 01:23:24,821
go,
listen,

2077
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:26,820
let me show you something here.
Shut the fuck up.

2078
01:23:26,821 --> 01:23:27,654
Just.
Yeah,

2079
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:30,190
it's got the biggest fucking pulled his
hog out.

2080
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:32,310
Like how big?
How big we you mean?

2081
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,820
What are we talking?
Ten inch limp.

2082
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,250
Jesus christ,
monster hog fat.

2083
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,320
Can you even get erect if your 10 inch?
Yes,

2084
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,980
he could know them.
Could you just guess like elephant?

2085
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,700
Yeah.
Milton berle on the rumors of his

2086
01:23:42,701 --> 01:23:43,810
endowment.
Let's hear this

2087
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:48,840
dawn by word of mouth.
You never know how much truth there is

2088
01:23:48,841 --> 01:23:51,270
to any of them.
So just once

2089
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:52,770
say becoming for the record.

2090
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:55,223
Is it true?

2091
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:04,790
Are you talking about my endowment
endowment's?

2092
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:13,010
Is it true?
All I can say is that I'm still working

2093
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:19,140
on it.
What does that mean?

2094
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:25,370
No,
that's been thrown at me so many times.

2095
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:32,311
That Question.
I don't know what's so thrilling about.

2096
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:34,500
Is it true?
I really doN't know,

2097
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,650
you know,
I'm not the only man in the world.

2098
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:44,620
There are better men than me.
Of course you would have to show them to

2099
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:48,130
me.
Now.

2100
01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:53,131
I've had a little success with it
even recently at ada,

2101
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:58,500
so it seems quite true
online.

2102
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:03,340
Know
that when I get an erection

2103
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:09,490
I black out.
I,

2104
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:13,940
I really do hope that he was getting
laid at 88.

2105
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:20,860
They say that I had a friend and I'm one
of her friends worked at a nursing home

2106
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:27,800
and she was saying that they just fuck
like cats and dogs in that place.

2107
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,460
I believe dudes get ahold of viagra and
they don't give a fuck and there it's

2108
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,580
like a dormitory.
So like they don't have any

2109
01:25:34,581 --> 01:25:38,550
responsibilities because look changed
their whole fucking.

2110
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:39,530
Oh yeah,
it changed the game.

2111
01:25:39,531 --> 01:25:41,240
But here's the thing,
when you think about people in nursing

2112
01:25:41,241 --> 01:25:42,074
homes,
right?

2113
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,330
Essentially,
no one can take in,

2114
01:25:44,331 --> 01:25:45,710
right?
You have to be in a nursing home because

2115
01:25:45,711 --> 01:25:49,280
your family can handle you anymore or
it's just you need assistance.

2116
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:51,080
So as soon as you start getting
assistance,

2117
01:25:51,081 --> 01:25:52,280
right,
you get assisted living.

2118
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:56,110
It's not good.
But it's also you have less

2119
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:58,330
responsibility,
less things to think about,

2120
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,790
less things to Worry about.
You're in this assisted living place and

2121
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:04,100
you're with a bunch of other checks that
are just like you

2122
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,730
in the same boat and like come on girls
and it's not like you get to a certain

2123
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:09,170
age,
you just get tired of dick.

2124
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:12,110
Right.
TheY probably still want some dick and

2125
01:26:12,111 --> 01:26:15,500
they probably remember when only 30
years ago when they were young and hot

2126
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:17,330
and the guys can kind of remember it
too.

2127
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:18,950
And they're like,
let's just do this.

2128
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,960
What else are they going to do?
Play bingo.

2129
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,290
But also the other nephews come by with
fucking love chocolates and you much

2130
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:27,260
rather have a dick.
Then probablY someone's coming by trying

2131
01:26:27,261 --> 01:26:29,480
to change the will.
Get on the science of shit's probably

2132
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:31,910
gross.
Imagine talking to your relatives,

2133
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:33,130
you know,
they're trying to weasel you out of

2134
01:26:33,131 --> 01:26:33,780
money.

2135
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:34,780
We'll just wait.
Yeah.

2136
01:26:34,781 --> 01:26:37,870
We got an aunt like that nashville right
now where it just feels like everyone's

2137
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:41,320
stopping by just to hope to get into,
you know,

2138
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,940
can I have your fucking apartment when
you're going,

2139
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:44,860
dude,

2140
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:48,460
it happens.
I know a familY where the son tried to

2141
01:26:48,461 --> 01:26:53,200
get the mom to change the will and the
other son found out about it and they

2142
01:26:53,201 --> 01:26:58,201
start suing each other and fucking
christ over your mom's money like really

2143
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:01,270
fits.
But it's real common.

2144
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:02,500
Yeah,
it's crazy.

2145
01:27:02,501 --> 01:27:03,820
Everybody thinks they're right.
You know,

2146
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:08,260
so I helped her.
I have the right to this and everybody

2147
01:27:08,261 --> 01:27:10,300
gets real weird.
But mick said that

2148
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:12,660
I always liked it when they had those
wills where the gut,

2149
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:15,410
you know,
if it was really rich guys and they'll

2150
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:18,960
be like a mystery,
like 5 million to some girl who they

2151
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:19,923
never knew.
You know?

2152
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,660
There's some secretAry who used to work
for like 20 years ago that he stuck it

2153
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:25,500
in there.
Yeah.

2154
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,660
He's thrown decatur for years.
Nobody knew.

2155
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:31,560
That would be the best relationship.
Feel like a secretary to keep her mouth

2156
01:27:31,561 --> 01:27:34,200
shut.
You guys just both smashed it and you

2157
01:27:34,201 --> 01:27:35,500
can say,
I'll leave you something in the will.

2158
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:36,840
You ain't got to pair then.
Yeah.

2159
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:41,700
Was that what it is?
Pain or maybe she liked the deck as a

2160
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:42,534
gift.
Yeah.

2161
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:46,650
Saying like it'd be a nice thing that
I'm going to start telling women that

2162
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:49,770
leaves them.
Somebody in the will you get my last

2163
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:52,530
album broke even you can have half,
but with your reckless lifestyle,

2164
01:27:52,531 --> 01:27:54,930
don't you think that they would be
worried that you would die penniless

2165
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,090
because you're so impulsive and law

2166
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,740
gonna be penniless soon if these,
if these things don't turn around.

2167
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:03,080
But Yeah.
DId you record really just break even as

2168
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,430
many as you sold?
Yeah.

2169
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:09,431
Well I say that as a joke but not really
a joke because what I did was I took all

2170
01:28:10,161 --> 01:28:11,870
the money and put it into the new
record.

2171
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:14,570
Right.
So in a weird way I've seen no money

2172
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:16,670
from it,
but I have the touring money though,

2173
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,350
but I have but I have,
you know,

2174
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:21,440
like I'm putting everything I have into
the new band,

2175
01:28:21,441 --> 01:28:22,270
into the new.

2176
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:24,730
Do you mind saying how many albums you
sold?

2177
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:26,640
I forget what it was.
I mean it's.

2178
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,800
It was a crazy number for physical.
It was like over 50,000 physical copies,

2179
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:34,790
which is,
which seems rare,

2180
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:36,860
which to me it didn't seem like very
much,

2181
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:39,950
but someone brought me in a cd just a
few days ago and I was like,

2182
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:41,360
look at this thing.
Who was it?

2183
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,700
Oh,
it's everlast.

2184
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:47,520
He brought me in war porn,
but you could see.

2185
01:28:47,710 --> 01:28:49,400
Here's another thing.
Can you read that?

2186
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:51,200
You think you could read that bottom?
The white part

2187
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:56,400
was that say
infestation.

2188
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,473
Yeah,
exactly.

2189
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:00,090
What is war porn?
Yeah,

2190
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,080
man,
you got to fix the font.

2191
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:01,711
This shit.
Yeah,

2192
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:02,070
that's what I've

2193
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,060
been saying it.
He was like,

2194
01:29:03,061 --> 01:29:03,894
no,
it's art.

2195
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,920
It's art.
And I was like,

2196
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:06,930
okay,
well art that people aren't getting

2197
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,170
what?
It's an here with me.

2198
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:12,030
I've been having a lot of issues too.
I'm fucking pissed at spotify right now.

2199
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:15,540
What are they doing?
Here's my issue with spotify is,

2200
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:16,403
which is,

2201
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:22,130
I don't know if you guys use spotify,
but almost everybody does and people

2202
01:29:22,131 --> 01:29:23,510
don't know this.
I'm going to get the truth out,

2203
01:29:23,511 --> 01:29:27,260
which is those big giAnt numbers you see
on the thing that people do.

2204
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:29,510
People not like me and you,
but there's these playlists that are

2205
01:29:29,511 --> 01:29:32,180
fucking huge,
like some people just go on spotify to

2206
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:34,220
listen to like country hits,
you know,

2207
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:38,800
or country wild country.
I don't know why the fuck they refused

2208
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:42,530
to fucking playlist me.
So everyone else's has these inflated

2209
01:29:42,531 --> 01:29:45,580
numbers.
But when I did your.

2210
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:50,960
Did your show the first time eating
pussy kicking ass became the number one.

2211
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,850
I don't know if you knew that.
I probably sent to send you that info

2212
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:54,830
became the.
Had the viral charts of what's going.

2213
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:57,800
The actual with the actual listens,
the viral charts.

2214
01:29:57,830 --> 01:30:01,220
eatin pussy kicking ass was the number
one most viral song in the on the

2215
01:30:01,221 --> 01:30:02,420
planet.
After I did your show,

2216
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,860
I said,
well now can you put me on some of your

2217
01:30:04,861 --> 01:30:06,140
like country play?
Listen shit.

2218
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:10,130
And the guy who's the guy who runs the
country playlist,

2219
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:13,290
it's expect to the meet the new boss.
Same as the old boss shit.

2220
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,380
There's a guy from country,
the guy they hired a guy from,

2221
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:19,500
from terrestrial country radio who,
who designed those playlists and he

2222
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,850
won't put me on the fucking playlist
because I say fucking dirty words.

2223
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:26,150
Uh,
so I'm losing tons of listeners and I

2224
01:30:26,151 --> 01:30:26,380
can't

2225
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,213
get on the,
you know,

2226
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:30,850
like when you see Florida Georgia line
with 100 million listens.

2227
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:34,060
A lot of those are just from automatic
listens just from those fucking playlist

2228
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,020
and people don't know that shit.

2229
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:38,570
We had an offer to do one of those was a
spotify or the other one.

2230
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,410
Pandora or spotify.
Yeah.

2231
01:30:42,411 --> 01:30:43,660
They do podcasts and,
but,

2232
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:45,230
but I was like,
well what do you,

2233
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,750
what you guys have an app?
Do you guys have money?

2234
01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:49,670
Like what's going on with this?
Like what is this?

2235
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:55,190
You guys are just distributing content
so you must be making some money.

2236
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,320
I didn'T want to pay you,
but it's very,

2237
01:30:57,321 --> 01:30:58,190
very,
very,

2238
01:30:58,191 --> 01:30:59,390
very,
very little.

2239
01:30:59,391 --> 01:31:02,230
It's just doesn't make any sense that
you would actually.

2240
01:31:02,231 --> 01:31:04,640
I actually make when they,
when it gets played,

2241
01:31:04,641 --> 01:31:08,660
actually make decent money from the
combine because I didn't want to say how

2242
01:31:08,661 --> 01:31:11,090
much online but I would,
but um,

2243
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:14,030
because I own my own label,
most of those artists have to,

2244
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:17,660
the label takes all their spotify money.
what's confusing to me is like what's

2245
01:31:17,661 --> 01:31:20,200
the benefit other than like being
introduced to stuff that you never would

2246
01:31:20,201 --> 01:31:23,120
have heard of before.
Like the benefit of spotify is the same

2247
01:31:23,121 --> 01:31:26,030
benefit you would get from radio except,
but streaming,

2248
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:27,500
except it's in real time,
right?

2249
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,460
Yeah.
Me then better to.

2250
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,250
The benefit to me is to listen to what.
Oh,

2251
01:31:31,251 --> 01:31:33,260
I'm on the road.
I haven't listened to this zeplin

2252
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:34,580
element a long time.
Then you have it,

2253
01:31:34,581 --> 01:31:38,060
but so like you can make a spotify
playlist and people can listen to your

2254
01:31:38,061 --> 01:31:38,894
playlist.
Is that the,

2255
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:39,830
is that the case?
Correct.

2256
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:42,850
You could make one and everyone could
listen to like the updated one you

2257
01:31:42,851 --> 01:31:45,480
share.
Diplo is a popular producer and he has

2258
01:31:45,481 --> 01:31:47,320
an updated hip hop list.
He makes.

2259
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:51,090
He updates it every few days,
but there's no official spotify one

2260
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:54,250
that's separate from las.
Bought a fire official playlist.

2261
01:31:54,251 --> 01:31:58,150
It's just when you searched for him and
follow an influencer you like.

2262
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,980
So I started a

2263
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,500
playlist.
I could put your song on my playlist

2264
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,320
and then it would be on.
Yeah.

2265
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:07,300
But the people for some reason they go
in,

2266
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:10,120
they own the interface so they make it.
So there were offIcial ones are the big

2267
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:12,640
ones on the page.
So you just went over here.

2268
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:16,070
The country hits like this.
This album's going to be in the top 10.

2269
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:19,420
They won't fucking play it.
So I'm in,

2270
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,060
I'm not saying I'm banned but you know,
if they ain't gonna put me on the

2271
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:24,580
playlist and I'm,
I'm at a disadvantage.

2272
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:28,710
Like who the fuck cares about?
I mean is it that big a deal?

2273
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:31,690
Say hey you.
So they do pay you when it goes on.

2274
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:33,760
You actually make like get check when,
when,

2275
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:34,863
when,
when my,

2276
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:35,860
when people listen,
I get,

2277
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,753
I get paid.
Yeah.

2278
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:37,990
See this?
Um,

2279
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:40,470
I don't,
I just don't think when I.

2280
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:43,880
There's a band of like a year,
you can't do this now,

2281
01:32:43,881 --> 01:32:48,080
but they gameD the system and they made
it an album that was silence and told

2282
01:32:48,081 --> 01:32:52,100
their fans to stream at all night long
and so they made a bunch of money just

2283
01:32:52,101 --> 01:32:55,640
off of the streams being played of
silence for like eight hours a day.

2284
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:58,390
How could you do that?
But there was no way.

2285
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,040
They didn't have any writing to stop
someone from doing that,

2286
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,540
from uploaded.
They stop it now.

2287
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:03,560
You Can't do that now.
Yeah,

2288
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:05,060
that's the limit.
There is someone up.

2289
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:07,400
I saw the other day,
you couldn't someone up like eight hours

2290
01:33:07,401 --> 01:33:12,050
of rain so.
Well that's someone's going to get paid

2291
01:33:12,051 --> 01:33:14,100
for that.
That rain track someone owns.

2292
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:17,370
Is that recording here?
You got to make sure that you didn't

2293
01:33:17,371 --> 01:33:20,610
steal it from youtube or something.
Also someone had to actually be up for

2294
01:33:20,611 --> 01:33:23,540
eight hours recording.
You deserve a little bit of money and

2295
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,380
there's a lot of people you got to do
that until their fans,

2296
01:33:25,381 --> 01:33:27,100
you know,
listen to this song.

2297
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,550
I just put it on repeat or with that
seems ridiculous.

2298
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:32,520
That's a silly request and you,
you,

2299
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:33,840
it's,
it's unfair.

2300
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:34,621
You like,
like,

2301
01:33:34,621 --> 01:33:35,640
hey,
make me some money.

2302
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,980
They used to do back in the day,
call your radio station and request my

2303
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:40,950
song on the radio.
It makes you different though.

2304
01:33:40,951 --> 01:33:41,040
Oh,

2305
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,730
and requesting a song and you want to
hear it.

2306
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:48,500
That's saying you want to hear it saying
stream my rain 24 hours a day.

2307
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:50,000
But yeah,
these playlists,

2308
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:50,740
you know,
it's almost,

2309
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,790
it's payola again.
It's like there's one guy who's

2310
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:55,210
controlling basically all the radio.
Yeah.

2311
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,890
It's like this one dude is just doing
it.

2312
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:59,980
Just like if you're his buddy,
you know what?

2313
01:33:59,981 --> 01:34:03,320
Any of those things.
It's like whether it's pandora or

2314
01:34:03,321 --> 01:34:08,321
whether it's spotify or what you're
doing is you're selling or distributing

2315
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:11,540
other people's work.
So you're basically just a distribution

2316
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:13,880
center.
I mean that's all it is.

2317
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:16,940
Other than like the unique features of
the distribution.

2318
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:18,800
Oh,
but you can make playlists or oh,

2319
01:34:18,801 --> 01:34:21,620
you can do this and people can recommend
things to,

2320
01:34:21,621 --> 01:34:24,320
oh,
there's algorithms and if they could

2321
01:34:24,321 --> 01:34:26,660
find out what you like and then you go
seek out those things.

2322
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,810
But at the end of the day,
if there's no things to seek out,

2323
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:34,700
you don't really sell anything like the
youtube people suing them.

2324
01:34:34,701 --> 01:34:37,340
Like youtube isn't anything right?
It's just a player.

2325
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:42,110
But youtube has bandwidth and that
bandwidth is extremely expensive.

2326
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:45,350
It's a different animal because you're
talking about they,

2327
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:48,320
they're not just streaming something,
they're streaming video.

2328
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:50,460
Video is,
you know,

2329
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:52,420
god,
what would kind of fucking.

2330
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:54,950
And they have to be able to store it
when they upload it.

2331
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:57,020
I mean,
what kind of storage?

2332
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,270
Fucking youtube

2333
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:00,680
and where is it all fucking stored?
Your mom's house.

2334
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,830
Fucking my upper,
upper fucking cunt.

2335
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,670
Is it different than like a museum,
like a,

2336
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:09,360
maybe like youtube where our museum is a
building and they store a bunch of stuff

2337
01:35:09,361 --> 01:35:12,240
that people come to look at and they
have to make some sort of money to keep

2338
01:35:12,241 --> 01:35:16,200
it running and to keep people there.
I Tried to make this argument the other

2339
01:35:16,201 --> 01:35:17,610
day.
I was talking to someone about it.

2340
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:20,460
Is it the same or is it completely
different?

2341
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,550
Um,
this is an argument that it's in the

2342
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:24,384
ballpark.

2343
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,680
Well,
the argument with like when youtube

2344
01:35:26,681 --> 01:35:29,380
originally sold for like billions right
at the time,

2345
01:35:29,381 --> 01:35:32,350
it was mainly just clips of other
people's shows back in the old.

2346
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:35,890
Now they have original content.
Now they have people that they pay

2347
01:35:35,891 --> 01:35:37,300
people to that.
But back when it was sold,

2348
01:35:37,301 --> 01:35:40,690
people make people made.
There were dudes who made hundreds of

2349
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:43,180
millions of dollars basically stealing,
selling off,

2350
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,760
you know,
clips of fucking was content.

2351
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:46,870
Other music videos.

2352
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:49,370
Yeah.
That is an issue or was a giant issue

2353
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:51,260
with youtube,
but they seem to have ironed out a lot

2354
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:53,630
of that.
Like if we put up someone's content,

2355
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,900
like if someone has an like.
It happens a lot with me with animal

2356
01:35:56,901 --> 01:35:59,650
attack videos.
Like anytime in animals attacking

2357
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:03,500
another animal or some nature of video.
If you try to put that up on youtube,

2358
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:05,630
you will get flagged and pulled off and
illegally.

2359
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,460
Remember last time we got pulled

2360
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:10,200
because for putting on my song and I was
like,

2361
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,200
I told the,
the distributor like I give you

2362
01:36:13,201 --> 01:36:14,400
permission.
You it kept getting

2363
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:15,720
tagged or something,
right?

2364
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:17,830
Yeah.
When we had everlast on when we're

2365
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,210
planning is war porn songs,
we had to make sure that we have

2366
01:36:21,211 --> 01:36:26,211
permission to release the flags and all
these things for us before we ever did

2367
01:36:26,311 --> 01:36:27,360
it.
We had to like coordinate.

2368
01:36:27,361 --> 01:36:29,850
Well not my.
I get flagged uploading my own fucking

2369
01:36:29,851 --> 01:36:31,490
videos,
which is really.

2370
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:32,431
I just,
they say.

2371
01:36:32,431 --> 01:36:34,890
Do you own this?
I own it.

2372
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:36,390
You own all your style?
Yeah.

2373
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,890
I own your videos.
Everything.

2374
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:39,100
I owned my master's.
Yeah.

2375
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:41,880
Even eating pussy and kicking ass.
The one that was on comedy central.

2376
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,670
I own the song.
I don't own that video.

2377
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:47,190
Okay.
So within that video gets uploaded

2378
01:36:47,191 --> 01:36:48,120
though.
Like I say,

2379
01:36:48,121 --> 01:36:51,540
if you took that video and uploaded it
onto your channel,

2380
01:36:51,541 --> 01:36:53,790
would they flag it with comedy central?
Flag it

2381
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:56,270
maybe,
but they,

2382
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:57,590
they would,
they would that one.

2383
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,753
Other than that,
they would.

2384
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:00,440
That one,
they would have a right to I think,

2385
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,830
but everything else like you know,
like,

2386
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:05,250
like when the guys we fucked podcast
people call,

2387
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:07,310
they wanted to play a song from the new
record on my,

2388
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:09,890
on the podcast I was like,
this is like an intro music.

2389
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:11,500
I'm like,
I give you permission,

2390
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:13,520
I own it.
Even if they come at you,

2391
01:37:13,521 --> 01:37:14,920
there's no suit lawsuit [inaudible],

2392
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:19,450
so you don't have something like that
where someone's looking for people that

2393
01:37:19,451 --> 01:37:22,240
are uploading your stuff to youtube or
things along those lines.

2394
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:24,590
Like I was talking about those like,
like I,

2395
01:37:24,591 --> 01:37:27,750
I have had like youtube gamers who like
want to like up.

2396
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,710
Can we cap load your video to my
channel?

2397
01:37:29,711 --> 01:37:30,401
I'll always be like,
yeah,

2398
01:37:30,401 --> 01:37:31,020
sure.

2399
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:32,070
Right.
But that's the one I'm talking about.

2400
01:37:32,071 --> 01:37:34,440
I'm talking about like somebody just
creates a channel,

2401
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:37,740
just starts uploading your content,
which happens all the time.

2402
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:39,270
Oh yeah.
I've seen it around a lot,

2403
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:40,420
but you know,
um,

2404
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:42,780
but you don't have anybody that flags
out for you?

2405
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:48,070
I think it's a good question.
I think that there's a,

2406
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:50,860
there's a um,
algorithm on youtube that catches it

2407
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:53,890
that because,
you know,

2408
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:54,600
my,
my,

2409
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,300
my,
my d distribution goes through this

2410
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,670
distribution company.
Right.

2411
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,960
And I think they have someone on their
team who does like to fly,

2412
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:05,053
you know,
like,

2413
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:07,180
I don't know how they know it,
but there's definitely,

2414
01:38:07,181 --> 01:38:08,730
there's some kind of algorithm,
you know,

2415
01:38:08,731 --> 01:38:11,250
like you said when you put it in it,
here's that everlast songs,

2416
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,620
you know,
and I think there's someone that does

2417
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:15,300
flag it for me.
But again,

2418
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:17,510
I don't know.
I think we're finding out too,

2419
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,930
I don't know where the fuck my money's
going.

2420
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:25,780
You should do some sort of an online
video series like where you're giving

2421
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:28,850
people access to you getting on the tour
bus,

2422
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,760
traveling and going different places
because you know,

2423
01:38:31,761 --> 01:38:34,140
you're doing this podcast now.
I Think that would add,

2424
01:38:34,190 --> 01:38:35,570
that would sort of compliment that.

2425
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:37,840
Well that'd be good too.
We'll hopefully the,

2426
01:38:37,841 --> 01:38:38,140
you know,
the,

2427
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:40,100
the,
the thing rick was shooting that'll,

2428
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:44,290
if that's around enough will show enough
behind this,

2429
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:45,163
you know,
that be a,

2430
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:48,560
a bigger,
a version of something like that.

2431
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:49,130
Yeah,

2432
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:50,660
they'll definitely.
And yeah,

2433
01:38:50,661 --> 01:38:55,100
if you start doing it from showtime and
then take it to youtube or wherever and

2434
01:38:55,101 --> 01:38:57,380
start streaming it on the road,
I think that's a great idea for you.

2435
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,960
Yeah,
it's been cool though.

2436
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:01,400
It's weird too because you get back into
the whole like,

2437
01:39:01,401 --> 01:39:03,160
you know,
that,

2438
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:04,400
you know,
giving.

2439
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,380
I'm giving my music,
you know,

2440
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:06,990
the,
the,

2441
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:09,080
the,
the tv thing is going to be for myself.

2442
01:39:09,081 --> 01:39:11,720
So how much do I sell myself?
The music,

2443
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:12,913
you know,
it's like,

2444
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:16,880
do I do I do,
I try to rip them off on the fucking

2445
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:18,520
price of the music?
No,

2446
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:19,810
because I want the thing to,
it's easy.

2447
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:22,890
It's very weird areas where people are
like,

2448
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:24,260
try to talk you out of just like,
oh,

2449
01:39:24,261 --> 01:39:26,640
just give me the fucking music.
You know,

2450
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:30,340
like if you do a standup special,
I'm sure there's,

2451
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,950
they've had negotiations.
I'm not speaking for you,

2452
01:39:33,951 --> 01:39:34,910
but there's probably times where there's
like,

2453
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,830
listen,
this suspicious is going to help you,

2454
01:39:37,190 --> 01:39:39,200
so take fucking less money here.
Don't do that.

2455
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:40,700
It's like,
it's almost like they're doing you a

2456
01:39:40,701 --> 01:39:41,840
favor,
kind of a general.

2457
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:44,330
They can do stuff like that.
They can say,

2458
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:46,580
you know,
if they're right,

2459
01:39:46,581 --> 01:39:47,600
they're right.
If they're not,

2460
01:39:47,601 --> 01:39:48,410
they're not,
you know,

2461
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:50,090
I mean if you're chris rock,
they're not right.

2462
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:53,510
They have to pay chris rock like it's
good for them more than it's good for

2463
01:39:53,511 --> 01:39:53,890
him.

2464
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,090
Well,
I'm saying like if you ever had any

2465
01:39:55,091 --> 01:39:58,150
issues with like I'm telling.
Well guess what,

2466
01:39:58,151 --> 01:39:59,410
your last couple of in netflix,
right?

2467
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,630
My last one was netflix.
My one before that was comedy central

2468
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:06,780
and like you want them to like market it
more of your head issues and they're

2469
01:40:06,781 --> 01:40:07,614
just let you know.

2470
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:09,710
No,
unfortunately no.

2471
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:12,140
Comedy central was great.
That was going to say the other thing

2472
01:40:12,141 --> 01:40:14,630
too is you've got a bigger marketing
outlet than any of them,

2473
01:40:14,631 --> 01:40:15,950
so now I do.
Yeah.

2474
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:19,250
And netflix doesn't really market.
They put up a few billboards and just

2475
01:40:19,251 --> 01:40:21,890
leave it alone.
They like let people word of mouth,

2476
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,260
but that's the thing,
like if someone puts out a comedy,

2477
01:40:24,261 --> 01:40:29,261
special
fears comedy special coming out July

2478
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,710
18th,
he was just on here,

2479
01:40:31,711 --> 01:40:32,100
right?
Yeah.

2480
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:34,250
Was yesterday.
If he puts something out,

2481
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:36,710
comedy fans are just going to get the
word out.

2482
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:38,890
Word of mouth.
You've got to go check it out.

2483
01:40:38,891 --> 01:40:39,711
You got to listen to it.
I mean,

2484
01:40:39,711 --> 01:40:42,190
I found out about a lot of people
specials because the main

2485
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:43,690
thing with my records,
which was it,

2486
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:46,600
it was a lot of which I really loved,
was that it was,

2487
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:49,060
it was old school.
It was literally word of mouth.

2488
01:40:49,061 --> 01:40:53,290
It wasn't like.
I mean there wasn't means until it

2489
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:56,830
wasn't.
Memes are fucking youtube ads and all

2490
01:40:56,831 --> 01:40:57,664
that shit.
It was just,

2491
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:00,250
you got to hear this shit.
It was found out about it.

2492
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:01,770
I found out about it from people send
them,

2493
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:04,060
sending it to me.
You already knew you were doing

2494
01:41:04,061 --> 01:41:05,830
something,
but then people just started.

2495
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:08,260
Just started sending me shit just
randomly.

2496
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:09,960
That didn't even know I knew you.
Well I th,

2497
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,020
I think that it was.
Yeah.

2498
01:41:11,021 --> 01:41:12,700
I think what happened is just,
you know,

2499
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:13,534
it's like

2500
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,010
they'd never heard country music used
with this.

2501
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:17,761
It's like,
dude,

2502
01:41:17,761 --> 01:41:19,470
you gotta hear this motherfucker.
He's talking,

2503
01:41:19,471 --> 01:41:20,304
you know,
like,

2504
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:22,940
like hip hop guys and fucking country
and it's fucking crazy,

2505
01:41:22,941 --> 01:41:24,220
you know,
and they get up.

2506
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:27,000
You gotta make nowadays.
You just got to be so loud,

2507
01:41:27,001 --> 01:41:31,050
I guess is maybe what it is.
It's hard to believe that you were the

2508
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:34,790
first guy that figured out sort of the
andrew dice clay approach to send no

2509
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:36,340
comedy.
You know,

2510
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:40,950
I say comedy,
I'm sorry to country music comedy,

2511
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:43,670
sort of shock comedy.
Like,

2512
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:47,580
yeah,
I was just like I say when people tell

2513
01:41:47,581 --> 01:41:51,510
me that I'm just like,
all I did was not censor myself and have

2514
01:41:51,511 --> 01:41:53,820
fun and I,
we the new album,

2515
01:41:53,821 --> 01:41:56,160
I think you can hear us having even more
fun than the last one.

2516
01:41:56,161 --> 01:41:59,850
The last One I felt it feels a little
stiff almost like I was trying to figure

2517
01:41:59,851 --> 01:42:01,890
out this one.
You can hear us having a fucking blast.

2518
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:05,010
It was like,
because country musIc is so serious and

2519
01:42:05,011 --> 01:42:06,630
the people are so serious,
it's just like,

2520
01:42:07,170 --> 01:42:09,630
you know,
just fucking let loose and have some

2521
01:42:09,631 --> 01:42:10,530
fucking fun.
Yeah.

2522
01:42:10,531 --> 01:42:15,360
It's kind of be so bizarre to see a room
full of guys singing along to some of

2523
01:42:15,361 --> 01:42:18,360
your lines.
Then I sucked his dick and I kicked his

2524
01:42:18,361 --> 01:42:20,220
ass.
Suck day.

2525
01:42:20,221 --> 01:42:23,130
Yeah.
well that new song called puss in boots

2526
01:42:23,131 --> 01:42:26,820
and one of the line is a
line about,

2527
01:42:26,821 --> 01:42:27,654
you know,

2528
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:32,520
she,
her tongue,

2529
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:34,710
her tongue knows where my butthole is
that is in the chorus,

2530
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:36,800
you know.
Um,

2531
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:39,330
and I'm seeing watching people screamed
that out.

2532
01:42:39,331 --> 01:42:41,920
You know,
it's like I was dicking around man,

2533
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:43,020
you know,
like don't do that,

2534
01:42:43,021 --> 01:42:47,010
you know,
I want a girl on a cowboy hat or tongue

2535
01:42:47,011 --> 01:42:48,090
knows.
And my butthole is that,

2536
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:51,150
um,
that's a weird thing to hear back at you

2537
01:42:51,151 --> 01:42:53,460
just as well.
It's weird when you were thinking like,

2538
01:42:53,461 --> 01:42:55,350
should I even put this in the song was
we were just like,

2539
01:42:55,351 --> 01:42:57,420
this is a crazy thought.
What if I just go with it instead of

2540
01:42:57,421 --> 01:43:00,150
trying to hold myself back,
which is all the best shit,

2541
01:43:00,151 --> 01:43:02,760
you know.
But obviously the impact has been

2542
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:05,490
tremendous.
I mean the results are amazing.

2543
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:07,200
I mean,
just the idea that we're playing the

2544
01:43:07,201 --> 01:43:09,240
troubadour tonight and it's sold out a
month ago.

2545
01:43:09,241 --> 01:43:09,990
It was fucking crazy.

2546
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:13,170
Yeah.
You're selling out way in advance and

2547
01:43:13,190 --> 01:43:14,080
that's a big place.
Well,

2548
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:16,350
the troubadours like a famous,
you know?

2549
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:18,450
Yeah.
You know,

2550
01:43:18,451 --> 01:43:21,180
a lot of horrible fucking music that's
got their start there,

2551
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:22,850
you know,
and Just to,

2552
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:24,480
for,
for me to go up there and singing about

2553
01:43:24,481 --> 01:43:25,460
puss in boots,
you know,

2554
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:27,730
it was like to conquest.
Yeah.

2555
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:28,910
Like concord.
Yeah.

2556
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:30,600
Fuck you.
I'll do it.

2557
01:43:30,601 --> 01:43:32,160
I'll put it to the flag.
I'll put up.

2558
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:33,930
I'll do this shit the way I fucking want
to do it.

2559
01:43:33,931 --> 01:43:36,120
Fuck you guys.
Well it's another era.

2560
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:39,570
It's or another,
a rather a representation of our era

2561
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:41,820
that this world is not what it used to
be.

2562
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,970
We're in a different place.
Totally.

2563
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:45,810
Well that's why I kept bringing it back
to this,

2564
01:43:45,811 --> 01:43:48,060
which is just like you can make whatever
you fucking want.

2565
01:43:48,061 --> 01:43:50,730
You have to censor yourself.
Find the people who,

2566
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:53,180
you know,
find the rogan's,

2567
01:43:53,181 --> 01:43:55,150
whoever in your world that you know,
get the,

2568
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,480
can get the word out bigger.
You know,

2569
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:00,890
there's ways to make it wasted,
to distribute it in ways to promote it

2570
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:03,650
without fucking suck in some networks.
Dick,

2571
01:44:03,651 --> 01:44:04,484
you know.

2572
