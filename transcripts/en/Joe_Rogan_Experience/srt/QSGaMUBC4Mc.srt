1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,510
Here we go,
four,

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:04,890
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,990
one.
Boom.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,430
First of all,
before we get started,

5
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:10,920
I want to say I love your reviews.
You are my favorite.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,050
You,
you have the.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,610
Well you and Lou.
I love Lou too,

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,910
but you,
you,

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,883
you're so good at covering all the bases
of whether it's cell phones or any kind 

10
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:25,020
of weird technology that's coming out 
and you just,

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,550
you just nail it.
You just,

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,380
you're so.
You're my go to guy man.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,950
Well,
thank you.

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,900
That's quite an intro.
I appreciate that.

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,510
I really want to tell it like whenever a
new cell phones out,

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,490
like I saw that you walked in with the 
red,

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,800
but that's your,
that's not your daily driver.

18
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,880
No,
I thought you would like this.

19
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,090
This is,
I mean every phone now is glass on glass

20
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:42,924
and everything,
you know?

21
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,190
Uh,
but this,

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,040
this red hydrogen one has a lot of weird
stuff about it.

23
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,560
Uh,
it's first of all,

24
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,730
it's about twice as big as it has to be,
but it's from red,

25
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,490
which is a camera company.
Why all these buttons everywhere.

26
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,770
So really good grip buttons.
This is just a grip,

27
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,613
this grip,
you can probably drop it from 45 feet 

28
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:04,500
and it'll be fine.
Throw it across the room,

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,830
but the weird part is it's made by red,
so red is a camera company there.

30
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,990
They used their cameras.
I love their cameras,

31
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:11,590
but then they come out with this,
which is a function.

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,330
It's kind of weird,
but there is a screen.

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,810
Yeah,
it's my foot actually.

34
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:18,300
So that's next to the.
The iphone eight plus,

35
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,930
which is already a huge phone.
What is this metal thing on the back?

36
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,410
That brass looking.
So it's got these pins and it's supposed

37
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:28,710
to next year support modules that will 
connect to it.

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,370
So potentially Vr,
better camera,

39
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,340
bigger battery,
a Vr,

40
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:35,970
whatever.
Read,

41
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,060
decide to support or make will attach to
it,

42
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,750
but it's also Kinda may or may not 
happen for awhile.

43
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,340
Yeah,
because Jamie ordered one.

44
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,490
When did you order one?
Paid for it last.

45
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,580
I don't know.
Right when I went on sale last August,

46
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,590
maybe vaporware,
mine.

47
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,690
My official ingest ship.
That's a prototype.

48
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,880
This is the prototype you have here?
Yes,

49
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,590
seven.
I've worked with red for.

50
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,424
I've seen a lot of the process since 
I've gotten like eight software updates 

51
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:05,820
and this is not final,
but like gets a pretty good idea.

52
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,620
Yeah.
What do you think about it so far?

53
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,813
So I surprisingly get a lot of people 
like new camera companies or new 

54
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:15,630
companies come up and make a phone and 
it's just not right in a lot of ways.

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,130
They kind of took a lot of notes and 
they went and minimal with the software.

56
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,963
I like that about it.
I was expecting the camera to be 

57
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,910
amazing.
It's they don't use.

58
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,360
They don't make this sensor so the 
camera is not amazing yet,

59
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,580
but I think the modules,
we'll make this what it is.

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,330
I think the phone by itself is not 
really $1,300

61
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,183
phone,
but it's support for upcoming things 

62
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,850
that they're planning.
I think we'll make it good.

63
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,893
Is it a problem when a company tries to 
get into the cell phone business and 

64
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,240
you're competing with Samsung,
apple,

65
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,250
you know,
hard way.

66
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,263
There's just so many companies that are 
so advanced for you to be read who's 

67
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,200
essentially a camera manufacturer that 
make video cameras.

68
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah.
Really high end for people that

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,690
know a really high end hd video cameras 
and a lot of movies are shot on them.

70
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:05,770
Films,
all kinds of things.

71
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,660
You need to videos.
Yeah.

72
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,340
Oh,
you do all your youtube videos with it.

73
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,620
Yeah.
Is it really that good for you?

74
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,360
I mean,
is it worth having a read?

75
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,620
It's a large camera,
right?

76
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,410
It's heavy.
Yeah.

77
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,243
It started off not that great.
And then I got used to it and then they 

78
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:22,760
got better.
So that was probably like five years ago

79
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:24,860
that I first started with a red,
a red scarlet.

80
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,200
This four k five k cameron.
Yeah.

81
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,500
It's kind of a pain,
but the workflow has gotten better.

82
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:35,501
They've worked with smaller teams,
like individual creators even to get the

83
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:39,620
cameras now smaller it does more in a 
smaller body.

84
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:42,800
So it's gotten a lot easier to use a red
for a small team.

85
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,630
Whereas like,
yeah,

86
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:49,420
five years ago they were making a read 
for a movie shoot with 15 people using.

87
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah.
So how much do they weigh?

88
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,260
No.
Uh,

89
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,343
I couldn't tell you a weight,
I'd say probably between six and 10 

90
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,410
pounds at all.
Yeah,

91
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,870
because you,
it's completely modular.

92
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,990
You rig it up to be what you want.
So like you get that out the box,

93
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,440
which is just the brain we're looking at
for people who are just listening,

94
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,450
it says Red Dragon on the side.

95
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,160
Why is it called silver?
Red Dragon.

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,860
And you got some names.
It's pretty clutch looking.

97
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,710
It looks like a,
it looks really like a computer,

98
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,820
like.
So that's what,

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,713
that's what you're looking at is just 
the computer and the sensor and that 

100
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:22,670
side piece right there is the SSD 
reader.

101
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,340
Everything else,
all those pins you see on the top and on

102
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:26,174
the side,
that's where you connect what you want 

103
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:28,394
to make it the rig.
So if you're doing this eight years ago 

104
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:31,874
you would attach a viewfinder,
you'd attach a couple monitors for 

105
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,480
director as you would attach a controls 
more.

106
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,060
Yeah,
all the follow focus on the Lens.

107
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,310
Obviously the mount,
all this stuff has to attached to it.

108
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,803
But for just me and my use,
I'd use it more kind of like what you 

109
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:50,660
might see in another image,
which is just a monitor and SSD,

110
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,330
a controller and a lens and that does 
everything.

111
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,740
So is the idea

112
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,290
eventually that this phone is going to 
be able to do everything that that does.

113
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,610
So that I think if you asked read,
they would say yes,

114
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,450
but they aren't there yet,
obviously.

115
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,570
How could they released something and 
not have an amazing camera on?

116
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,300
Yeah,
that seems crazy that,

117
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,253
that I think is what I think a lot of 
people were super hyped about because 

118
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,290
obviously red's good with not just the,
they make the silicon for the camera,

119
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:24,190
but they're good at color science and 
autofocus and all these different things

120
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,340
that cameras should be good at.
Uh,

121
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,900
so when they come out with a phone that 
has a camera on it,

122
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,400
you just kind of expect it to be 
amazing.

123
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,273
So when it's not the best,
I firmly believe this is the best 

124
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,100
camera.
Then you have the Google Pixel three.

125
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,080
Yeah.
Is the best camera in a phone?

126
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,540
Are you a Google Pixel fanboy?
I this point,

127
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,580
I'm a fan,
I'm a fan of the camera,

128
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,190
which has turned me into a fan of the,
the rest of the phone.

129
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,040
Just the camera alone.
It's an unusual cameron that it only has

130
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,480
one.
One camera.

131
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,260
Yes.
Yeah.

132
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,920
There's one camera where everybody else 
is going with multiple cameras.

133
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,380
Three for Google's doing everything with
software.

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
Yes.
And I liked that about it.

135
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,780
Now is that the xl cxl it seems,
it doesn't seem that big.

136
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,750
It's kind of not that insane.
I think everyone's,

137
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:06,584
everyone's into the notch obviously,
which is a little different from what 

138
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,214
you might see in a,
an iphone or a Huawei phone or 

139
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,910
something.
Um,

140
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,803
but the software is very googly.
The screen is much better than last 

141
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,990
year.
It's glass of wireless charging.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,840
It's got all these things.
The last year's phone didn't have,

143
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,110
but the camera is absolutely what makes 
that phone good.

144
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,960
It's really that much better.
It is that much better.

145
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,860
What is so good about it?
Uh,

146
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,860
it's like you said,
it's the software.

147
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,693
So what Google does with HDR and 
essentially their image processing is a 

148
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,170
big part of why it's good.
You can put the same sensor in glass and

149
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:43,160
another smartphone with way weaker 
software and it wouldn't look as good.

150
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,370
Um,
but what they do with that,

151
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,610
that image processing APP,
it's a rolling buffer of images.

152
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,980
So you can take a,
it's like instant shutter.

153
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,300
So as soon as you press the shutter,
it's instant shutter a,

154
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,020
you freeze the motion.
The dynamic range is great.

155
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,930
The detail is great and it's photos are 
amazing.

156
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,330
I was amazed of the low light photos.
Yeah,

157
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,590
there was stunning because I had seen 
before that was the Walway,

158
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,470
the mate Rs,
I guess it was.

159
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,320
There's been a couple really good night 
modes in while we phones.

160
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,173
Yeah.
But this seemed even better than that 

161
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:15,644
and it didn't seem distorted.
It seemed like you realized it was at 

162
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,460
night,
but you could see all the detail.

163
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,541
Yeah,
it's hard.

164
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,010
It's just never going to look as good as
daytime.

165
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,000
But,
uh,

166
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,863
there's,
uh,

167
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,460
I haven't,
I don't have the update yet,

168
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,294
but there's going to be an update to the
pixel that has night site or another 

169
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,880
night mode that does the same thing,
which is taking a bunch of exposures and

170
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:32,714
long exposures and use a stabilization 
and hopefully get some much brighter 

171
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:40,570
image that looks way better than what 
would be different from the update in,

172
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,100
in,
in comparison to what it does now.

173
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,450
So right now if you just take a photo at
night,

174
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:47,030
it'll just try to noise,
reduce all.

175
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,400
Like when you take a photo at night,
there's a lot of grain,

176
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,263
you're pumping the ISO all the way up 
and when you clean all that noise out 

177
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,673
you are,
it's kind of like airbrushing the image 

178
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,800
and it's going to be softer.

179
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,470
So if you do a lot of noise reduction,
you lose all your detail.

180
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:03,620
It's really soft.
So low light photos just aren't as good.

181
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,090
But if you can take a longer exposure 
with better stabilization,

182
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,410
you can not crank the ISO as high,
not introduced as much noise.

183
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,750
And then at the end of the day,
have a more detailed,

184
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,613
better looking photo.
So that's the theory behind a lot of 

185
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,380
these night modes.
How do they do the all in software?

186
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,033
A lot of calibration,
a lot of knowing exactly how good the 

187
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,070
optical image stabilization is in the 
Lens.

188
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,290
And then electronic stabilization as 
well.

189
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:34,100
A lot of algorithms knowing what part of
the photo is moving versus what isn't.

190
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,613
So there's a lot of computational 
photography is what it's called a 

191
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,300
happening on the chip that makes it that
good.

192
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,313
It's just fascinating that Google is the
only one who's doing this with one 

193
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,430
camera as opposed to everyone else.

194
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,940
Like my iphone has several cameras.
I have a uh,

195
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,310
a note nine,
which I really like.

196
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,190
And one of the other things about Google
does not have a lot of Ram.

197
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,683
Now I've found that actually kind of a,
an interesting week point about this 

198
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,164
phone and I haven't even.
I've reviewed it and it was kind of 

199
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,760
skeptical about it's only only four gigs
of Ram,

200
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,650
which is like a couple of years ago.
Wow.

201
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,120
Four weeks or I'm at a phone.
That's amazing.

202
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,954
It's amazing,
but a lot of phones coming out and has 

203
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,080
six,
eight gigs of Ram.

204
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,120
Who has the most right now?
A phone,

205
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,430
just a gaming phone.
Just came out with 10 gigs of Ram or the

206
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,110
razor phone or a different.
Now another one,

207
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,270
I don't even remember the name,
but then there's also an apo.

208
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,860
Find x with 10 gigs of Ram,
but do you need that?

209
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,590
No,
you don't.

210
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,730
You don't need.
What would.

211
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,040
What would be the benefit of having 10 
gigs of Ram?

212
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,874
Like what software would run?
Basically the advantage to having more 

213
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:36,480
ram is keeping apps open and running in 
the background longer,

214
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,343
so if you have your camera and your 
twitter and your instagram and your web 

215
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,360
browser and all that,
a lot of high,

216
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,100
maybe a couple of games all running at 
the same time and then you multitask and

217
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,290
switch between them on a phone with less
ram.

218
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,124
You'll find that you'll switch from the 
game to the browser and you go back to 

219
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:56,700
the browser and it reloads everything 
because it completely garbage.

220
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:58,060
That from the memory.
After awhile,

221
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,350
because it was trying to save space,
so on the phone with four gigs of Ram,

222
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,303
this happened a couple of times where 
I'd be listening to music and I'd open 

223
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,304
the camera and take a few photos and 
then the music or the podcasts or 

224
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:08,964
whatever would just stop and it killed 
that APP in the background with only 

225
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,354
four gigs of Ram.

226
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm not doing that crazy things with 
multitasking.

227
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,013
Just two things running just to.
I think it might've been a bug because 

228
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,374
the camera uses a lot of memory and for 
whatever reason it just picks the other 

229
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,110
big memory app and kills it.
It's not very repeatable.

230
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,510
I've had it happen to me since I landed 
yesterday,

231
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,290
like a couple of times,
but it I think a phone with six or eight

232
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,124
gigs of Ram though.
The last phone I was using for awhile 

233
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,490
was the one plus six has eight gigs of 
Ram and I never happened to me.

234
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,900
Every time I multitask and go back five,
10 apps to go and open it,

235
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:43,734
it was right where I left off.
Is the Google Pixel three your favorite 

236
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,790
phone or is it just your favorite film?
Because of the camera.

237
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,810
It is my favorite phone period and it 
also has the best camera.

238
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,923
And is it your favorite film because it 
has pure Google because you have the 

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,833
android,
it's the latest android which is Kinda 

240
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,453
hard to find and then you get obviously 
this pure google experience in this 

241
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:12,090
amazing camera and a great display and 
my priority is in a phone or pretty much

242
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,953
along those lines.
I need a great camera and then I want a 

243
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,624
great display.
I want good software and then the rest 

244
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:20,070
kind of follows.
And you want pure Google,

245
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,930
right?
You don't want to be operating under the

246
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,640
Samsung Skin.
I don't mind.

247
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,400
I don't mind a skin if it's good.
Uh,

248
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:30,290
there's a lot of skins,
like one plus has oxygen less and it's a

249
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,760
skin.
Technically it's close to pure google,

250
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:36,000
but it's missing a lot of the pixel 
features but it's fine.

251
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:36,834
It's smooth.
It's great.

252
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,240
Is One plus running the latest android?

253
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,133
No,
no.

254
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,030
Who is,
it's a central phone.

255
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,200
So one plus I think just got the android
p update essential,

256
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:51,201
just got the android update and then 
everyone else is on like one version ago

257
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,120
or older.
And why?

258
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,100
Why is that a pain the ass for them?
Why can't it be universal?

259
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,203
I have a bunch of theories on why they 
don't update their software as quickly 

260
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,010
as they probably could.
I think a lot of it in the US,

261
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,720
especially as youth carriers,
when you have to get a.

262
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,090
You want to push a software update to a 
phone on verizon for example.

263
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:17,260
Not only do you have to like rewrite the
software and optimized and everything,

264
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:20,980
but then you have to submit it for like 
certification from verizon.

265
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:21,814
Verizon has to push that update.
That whole introduction of the third 

266
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,370
party through the carrier is a huge pain
in the ass.

267
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,400
And then on top of that,
I know a lot of people who when they get

268
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:32,770
a software update,
like actively avoid installing it,

269
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:35,350
they just don't want change in their 
phone.

270
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,723
So at the end of the day,
like they put all that money and work 

271
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,384
into making a software update and half 
the people never install it or don't 

272
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:44,494
care.
Then they just figured they might as 

273
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:48,700
well not put the money there.
So a lot of teams are.

274
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,120
A lot of manufacturers just don't.
They don't.

275
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,040
They,
they support the phone for a year or two

276
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,140
and then that's it.
But for folks like you,

277
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,180
for the power users,
that's big.

278
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,730
That's a big thing.
Having the latest and greatest.

279
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,720
Definitely.
Yeah.

280
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,010
That's why I'm a fan of phones that keep
the skin light and update quickly,

281
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,850
which is what you'll find with pixel and
essential in oxygen license,

282
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,410
stuff like that.
And that's really it.

283
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,840
Like Samsung takes a long time to get to
it.

284
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

285
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,420
Was Great.
As Samsung phones are,

286
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,940
they definitely are not first to get new
software.

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,610
They're trying to do it quicker 
apparently what I've been reading,

288
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,444
but I guess there is.
There's a bunch of issues always 

289
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,580
bottleneck.
Now when,

290
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,453
when you compare phones,
like do you have a checklist of things 

291
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:35,830
that you have like on a computer or is 
it just all off the top of your head?

292
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:36,664
Like do you,
do you have like a rating system that 

293
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:40,690
you use?
A personal rating system?

294
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,160
I don't have a rating.
I do have a,

295
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:42,994
like a,
like a checklist of things that I 

296
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:48,820
definitely pay attention to every time 
that I must go through screens,

297
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:49,654
displays and battery life,
how good the camera is and things like 

298
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,224
that.
But I'd never come to like a rating out 

299
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,434
of whatever.

300
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,310
I used to do that a long time ago,
but I stopped because I just,

301
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,390
it's kind of like a neverending.
You'll never,

302
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,363
you'll never get a 10 out of 10 
basically because if you ever give 

303
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,410
something a 10 out of 10,
the next one's going to be better.

304
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,273
Right.
So how do you,

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,833
how do you put that on the scale?
So I just don't turn up for October 

306
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,780
2018,
I guess he,

307
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,450
ah,
you'd be like this is the best phone.

308
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,430
Like I said,
if that say this is the best phone right

309
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,440
now,
then maybe that's not a 10 out of 10,

310
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,930
but it's like the best you can get,
but that,

311
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,130
that line just keeps moving so I don't 
give things numbers but see for me those

312
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,013
are the things you said that would be a 
pain in the ass that your music would 

313
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,120
shut off because you're using the 
camera.

314
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,820
That's kind of big.
That's a pain.

315
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:33,400
Yes.
Yeah,

316
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,150
that it's not a 10 out of 10 because of.
I think the memory is a problem.

317
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,610
Yeah,
the notches bothering some people.

318
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:43,030
It doesn't bother me anymore.
It just kind of blends in.

319
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:43,864
I don't really look at the notch.
So have you gone into the developer 

320
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,100
settings and fuck now?
Removal of the notch.

321
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:49,900
I tried it.
It wasn't that big a deal.

322
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,010
It just makes a big black

323
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,780
bar over the top.
Exactly.

324
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,660
And you just lose the screen you paid 
extra for that seems silly.

325
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,310
Yeah.
I don't mind it on the iphone.

326
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,890
I mostly,
mostly I use the excess Max.

327
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:05,210
This one right here,
but I'm so sour on apple because of what

328
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,140
they did with the batteries.
Yeah.

329
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,080
That was such a dirty thing to me 
because everybody had always suspected.

330
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,700
Like my friend Brian was always like,
dude,

331
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,470
I'm telling you when the new phones come
out,

332
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,350
your old phone starts moving slower.
My Dad's a conspiracy.

333
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,780
That's all horse shit.
Like your phone's just old bro.

334
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,700
But then when I found out that it was 
real,

335
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,050
I was like,
you assholes and problem.

336
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,923
And the problem was the way they didn't 
tell people like they could have just 

337
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,513
avoided the whole whatever pr we want,
whatever you wanna call it by just 

338
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:35,870
telling people,
look,

339
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,450
this is what we do on your phones.

340
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,293
Getting older.
We need to preserve either the CPU or 

341
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,624
the battery,
so we need to either voltage down the 

342
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,220
CPU or save your battery,
pick one and give us a choice.

343
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,000
They didn't tell us until people started
suspecting things and they had to make a

344
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:54,550
statement and then another kind of dirty
and like hidden by it.

345
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,543
Yeah.
I think it's a trick to try to get you 

346
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,710
to buy new phones.
I don't.

347
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,240
There was no way they didn't think about
that.

348
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,770
Of course,
there's no chance that.

349
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,230
Yeah.
Why else would they do it that way?

350
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,064
Why would.
Why wouldn't they just let the battery 

351
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:06,194
be slower or they let the CPB slower and
the best part is they give you the 

352
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:12,620
choice now,
but if you never look for it,

353
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,483
you'll never find it and they definitely
still default to saving your battery by 

354
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,230
under clocking a chip.

355
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,423
So your phone will still slow down if 
you don't know where to find that 

356
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,540
option.
So as soon as a new phones come out,

357
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,230
basically no motherfucker,
it's just dirty.

358
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,064
It seems pretty dirty yet because it's 
the thing that everybody always 

359
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:31,140
suspected.
Oh,

360
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,053
everybody was suspected.
There was some sort of engineered 

361
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:36,380
obsolescence and they're due.
They're doing this on purpose to get you

362
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:38,600
to keep buying the newest,
latest and greatest.

363
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,900
But I wanted to like go now apple.
Apple wouldn't do that.

364
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,290
I mean,
your friends,

365
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,153
hey,
paint this picture that's really up 

366
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,250
upright and like we want you to have the
best experience as long as possible,

367
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,410
which involves not replacing your 
battery,

368
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:58,200
which means we'll just slow down your 
phone just a little bit so that it's,

369
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,050
it,
it lasts longer in the battery.

370
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,990
Can keep up,
make sense on paper,

371
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,130
but on paper.

372
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,200
Well it's,
there's a lot of things about apple that

373
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:09,190
I really like a really love the,
the OSTP.

374
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,030
I really love it.
I mean it's,

375
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,470
it's just so much better than windows,
but their keyboard sucks so bad on their

376
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:17,360
laptop.
It's just all the laptop.

377
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,420
Yeah.
Cliquey,

378
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,990
it just doesn't,
it doesn't feel good.

379
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,150
There's the sketch,
shallow travel.

380
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,043
There's all these issues with.
I switched to a Lenovo and went with a 

381
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,850
thinkpad just for,
for standup.

382
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,240
I have to write a lot and I found out 
that I wrote way slower,

383
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,710
like maybe 10 words per minute slower.
Like it's,

384
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,583
it's a real issue because it's like you 
make a lot more mistakes with those 

385
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:42,140
little shallow clicky things.
Yeah.

386
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,330
And with the Lenovo you have um,
a much.

387
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,690
You have much more travel.
It's much easier to touch type.

388
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,310
It just feels better for me.
But that bums

389
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,150
me out.
It's like,

390
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:52,650
why can't they get that?
Right?

391
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,513
Like you,
you're making these things for creative 

392
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:55,890
people,
right?

393
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,930
That's your whole thing.
So I think different,

394
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:58,570
you know,

395
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,330
that's another thing I kinda got like,
it's again,

396
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,164
like what apple tries to portray 
themself as versus what you're actually 

397
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:07,210
experiencing.
If you never listen to apple and you get

398
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:07,991
the new laptop,
you're like,

399
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:09,910
wow,
let's keyboards worse sex,

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,240
why is this keyboard so shallow and 
mushy a,

401
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,700
and then you're supposed to listen to 
apple.

402
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:16,480
And they're like,
well,

403
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,150
we made it quieter.
We made it thinner.

404
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,430
So the laptop's thinner now.
Uh,

405
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,383
and they'll,
they'll give you all these reasons why 

406
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:24,910
they did what they did.
And there's supposed to go,

407
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:25,361
oh,
okay,

408
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,320
yeah,
that actually makes sense.

409
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:27,154
Maybe this is better,
but your experience often says the 

410
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,444
opposite.
So that's why people like to not listen 

411
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:36,610
to what apple says and just evaluate it 
without listening to that.

412
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,523
Particularly for writers,
for someone who writes and you write on 

413
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:41,964
a regular basis,
you want a comfortable keyboard and you 

414
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:45,691
know,
I've,

415
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,524
I've constantly searched for the best 
keyboard and right now I think it's 

416
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,124
probably the thinkpad,
but I've heard great things about the 

417
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,730
razor,
the razor pro,

418
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,713
which is the really large gaming one,
it has a mechanical keyboard for the 

419
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:02,130
first time ever on a laptop and that's 
supposed to be really good.

420
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,630
I have tried the blade and I have tried.
What I'm using right now is the surface,

421
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,960
the Microsoft surface laptop too and 
that's got a pretty good at keyboard.

422
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,490
Yeah,
it's travels a lot.

423
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:12,324
It's backlit.
And then the actual laptop part itself 

424
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,010
is not metal.
It's got like Al Conterra like you might

425
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:17,844
see inside a car,
like a soft touch on the laptop in my 

426
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,791
backpack.
Yeah.

427
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,460
So I'll go grab that.
It's kind of Falcon Tara.

428
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,830
Yeah.
Like fake Suede.

429
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,730
Yeah,
like what you seem to.

430
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,150
That's the craziest Shit I've ever heard
in my life now.

431
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:30,984
Can Tara?

432
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,460
Yeah,
I'm the razor.

433
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,690
Pull up that razer blade pro too.
If you get a chance,

434
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:40,690
we'll look at the surface first because 
he's going to go grab that.

435
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,793
But the razer blade pro,
it's also an enormous laptop and it has 

436
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,421
the.
Yeah,

437
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:47,254
that's it right there.
The razer blade pro is so big and wide 

438
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,080
that it actually has the mouse on the 
side,

439
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:54,520
like a track pad.
This is it.

440
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:55,340
Huh?

441
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,540
So that's the surface laptop too.
Oh Wow.

442
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,340
How weird.
And a keyboard.

443
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:04,340
It's pretty good.
It's like a polished Alcantara Ooh,

444
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,050
that feels good.
Yeah.

445
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,290
The question though,
whenever you ecm material is like if I'm

446
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,260
putting my palms on that all the time,
how long will that last?

447
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,273
Will it start to thin out and look kind 
of worn after awhile or will it stay 

448
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:18,560
looking like that?
I hope it does.

449
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,480
And also the whole laptop is matte 
black,

450
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,670
which is,
I think that looks dope,

451
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,593
but that's also usually a fingerprint 
magnet we carry around like a matte 

452
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:30,080
black thing.
You get like all this is grease on it or

453
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:32,450
whatever carrying it.
So that's a challenge for that laptop,

454
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:33,830
but I love it.
Well,

455
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,440
the other thing about

456
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,490
the difference between the keyboard on 
this versus the keyboard on,

457
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,113
what I have is I have the Lenovo Carbon 
[inaudible] [inaudible] and what I 

458
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,070
really like about this is that

459
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,870
there's,
they're not flat.

460
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,440
They have like a little bit of a,
like a dip to them.

461
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,160
So your fingers sort of a little bit.
Yeah,

462
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:59,080
there's a little bit of A.
Yeah,

463
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:00,960
that's smart.
I wish more so like you kind of.

464
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,950
It's easier.
Oh yeah.

465
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,050
It's easier to touch type when you have 
like the spot.

466
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:07,060
Yeah.
Why don't people figure that out?

467
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,880
I think all of it is just,
you get used to it like a,

468
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,743
there's a,
there's a google tablet that came out 

469
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:11,884
recently with a $200 keyboard accessory 
that has circular quays and slightly 

470
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:18,304
concave,
but like typing on it was fine and like 

471
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:21,940
they claim like,
oh yeah,

472
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:22,774
once you get used to it,
like the surface area of the key being 

473
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:27,520
circular makes it easier to type faster 
after awhile.

474
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,350
Huh?
I don't know if I buy that yet,

475
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:31,180
but maybe if you were a secretary and 
you really,

476
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,070
you're really used to the circular.

477
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,960
It looks like a typewriter when you just
look at it.

478
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,700
We want to pull that thing up.
That would be the google.

479
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,890
Oh,
what do they call it?

480
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,710
Something Tab.
It came out like the same time.

481
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,900
The pixel three and they're naming is 
weird with them,

482
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,680
but it has a.
yeah,

483
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,090
basically a surface like,
like $200 keyboard,

484
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:52,924
magnet accessory.
You can prop it up at any angle and it 

485
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:57,850
goes from a tablet to a laptop with this
keyboard dock.

486
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,440
Huh.
And then it's a,

487
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,570
it's kind of interesting.
But the circular quay is.

488
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,680
I found weird that Alcan.
Tara on the hand rest feels amazing.

489
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,180
Yeah,
that's really nice.

490
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,920
Yeah,
I was going to get used to that.

491
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,843
I,
I,

492
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,530
I've been using a Mac book pro for so 
long.

493
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,364
Like I,
the contrast is like I was really used 

494
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:17,690
to like having metal and metal feels 
premium and good.

495
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,260
It's like it's not going to wear down.
Um,

496
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,610
but I,
I like this a lot.

497
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,770
Well,
what metal doesn't feel good?

498
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,530
Those on your hands when you're sitting 
on it for a long time?

499
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,800
Just.
Yeah,

500
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,643
they kinda got where?
Like they wrap the material around to 

501
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,150
the sides.
Mac Book Pros.

502
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:36,660
Literally sharp.
Cut to kind of.

503
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,110
You put your hands on the edge for too 
long.

504
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,620
When Nova was carbon fiber.
Nice.

505
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:43,120
So this whole thing is a.
it's not cheap though.

506
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,103
No,
it's not cheap in comparison to a Mac 

507
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,430
laptop though.
It's true.

508
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,910
It is.
And there's way more options.

509
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,950
That's the other thing with a Mac.
You get like a 13 inch,

510
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:54,784
you get a 15 inch,
you gotta touch bar or you get nothing 

511
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,080
yet.
What's a matter of Jamie Pixel slate?

512
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,790
I just had it there.
The picture changed.

513
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,280
Oh these motherfuckers,
that's what it's called though.

514
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,830
Pixel sleep.
Oh there it is now.

515
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,180
So those are the key.
Circular quays and that sort of connects

516
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,014
to the tablet.
It's a great accessory like the magnet 

517
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,274
on the back,
like I don't know if you've seen a 

518
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:18,120
surface tablet with the little 
kickstand.

519
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,980
You kind of have like a couple notches 
where you can adjust it.

520
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,170
And I think the new version has infinite
adjustment,

521
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:25,450
but this is the same thing,
like there's a magnet in the back of the

522
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,284
surface or the pixel slate.
I've lets you adjust the tablet to any 

523
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,770
angle.
Watch videos type.

524
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,610
Apple's the only company that makes 
keyboards that I know that had it better

525
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
in like 2012 than they do in 2018.
If you get a 2012 macbook you.

526
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,480
Oh,
this is kind of better.

527
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,130
There's more travel.
Yeah.

528
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,600
You might think it's like an upgrade if 
they want backwards.

529
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,463
Yeah.
Yeah.

530
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,890
That's.
Yeah.

531
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,740
I agree.
Goofy.

532
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,850
Kind of agree.
I don't know how they did that.

533
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,893
Yeah.

534
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,800
Well there's so design oriented.
I mean everything looks stellar.

535
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,450
That's what it is.
Apple has been a,

536
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,800
not a victim of their own desire to make
great design,

537
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,053
but they often very often make 
compromises sometimes to the detriment 

538
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:13,810
of how good a product can be to make it 
look better.

539
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,130
Classic example was the Mac pro,
the little circular trashcan looking Mac

540
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:19,220
pro that came out.
Yeah,

541
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,320
he 12 or something like that.
They kept.

542
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:27,010
They made all these promises.
It's this sleek modern workstation,

543
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,060
it's going to have the xeon chips and 
big gps and I loved it,

544
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,223
uh,
but it only had one fan for a six slash 

545
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:34,984
$7,000
workstation and they constantly 

546
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:42,010
overheated and would throttle and 
eventually it was a nightmare for them.

547
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,913
Wasn't that something that was going on 
with the latest laptops with the latest 

548
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:46,790
Mac book pro?
Yeah.

549
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,660
Yeah.
Same thing,

550
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,850
same thing.
They made the,

551
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,450
the I nine,
the core I nine.

552
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:50,960
They put in this

553
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,050
super thin laptop.
They made this laptop so finn and I kept

554
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:56,030
the fan speed so low because it's got to
be quiet.

555
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,483
So they,
they just throttled the CPU down so it 

556
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:03,260
wouldn't get so hot that they had to 
kick up the fans that high.

557
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,370
So the actual performance,
even though the CPU is more powerful,

558
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,710
was not as good as the last model.
Right.

559
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,010
Which was to make it look good.
Exactly.

560
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,480
So yeah,
apple's been a victim of their own,

561
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:15,314
like desire to make things so beautiful 
and then they got fucked by Walway 

562
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,703
because while we came along with the 
mate book and the mate book pro is 

563
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:27,760
really a better version of the Mac book 
and into it.

564
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,440
Yeah,
he nailed it.

565
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:34,240
There's no bezels the way that Webcam 
pops up from the found interesting.

566
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,400
I don't know how it angles up your 
nostril.

567
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,670
Exactly.
It's like on

568
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,740
the table level of wherever you're 
sitting and looking up at you.

569
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,180
That's very odd.
But yeah,

570
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,043
there's,
there's a lot of great things about 

571
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:44,150
that.
But

572
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,300
pull that thing up mate book pro while 
we.

573
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:49,340
But meanwhile it's probably spying on 
you all day long.

574
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,160
Sending information to the Chinese 
government.

575
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,230
Yeah.
Always reputations and also hot.

576
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,470
Found some spy chip and their cell 
phone.

577
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh,
you're talking about the uh,

578
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,430
well there's a couple things that just 
happened with,

579
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,473
with chips in hardware.
There's another thing about a Bloomberg 

580
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:08,000
report.
Did you see that?

581
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,033
Yeah.
It was a the chips that came from all 

582
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:12,404
these,
this,

583
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,243
this server company or this company that
makes the chips that sells to all these 

584
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,174
big companies like apple and and major 
major companies and now everyone's 

585
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,670
compromised and after was like,
nope,

586
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:24,290
not true.
Definitely not true.

587
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,880
Don't say the chorus,
not us.

588
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:26,810
Yeah.
No 100 percent.

589
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,490
Not Us,
but like,

590
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:30,560
yeah.
That's a really weird story.

591
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,630
Look at this map.
Book blue.

592
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,160
The bezels

593
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,443
almost nonexistent.
So your challenge or just website if 

594
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:38,954
you're.
If you're just laptop rather than if 

595
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:44,340
you're wowway and you make that now you 
have to convince people to switch from

596
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,233
the Mac books that they love to,
that just on looks alone they could 

597
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:49,554
probably do it,
but then there's all the other features 

598
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,400
like,
well it doesn't run Mac os 10.

599
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,290
Do I have a message?
Right.

600
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,350
Do I have all these other things that I 
like about my Mac?

601
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,820
This huge touchpad?
Well,

602
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,920
it does have a huge touchpad yes,
but I say to this day still,

603
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,770
apple has the best laptop touch pad.
The multitouch stuff with a battery life

604
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,100
supposed to be excellent as well.
Right,

605
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,200
yeah.
How have I given that chart?

606
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,660
That chart was perfect because that's 
like all these x's for that.

607
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:16,860
Yes.
We have great design.

608
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,723
We have better ports.
You only have USBC on a little Mac book 

609
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,980
pro.
We have full size USB,

610
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,520
we have all this stuff will give audio 
to the Mac book pro.

611
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:24,690
It's got bigger speakers,
whatever,

612
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,550
but we have a better battery life.

613
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,383
We have all this better lower price,
all of the steps and you still have to 

614
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,840
reconcile with what people love about 
their macbook pros,

615
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:36,600
which is Mac is 10.
Well there's that,

616
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:40,470
but there's also people love having an 
apple product net too.

617
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,850
They do love that.
Yeah.

618
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,923
Like if someone.
If you could put an apple logo and a 

619
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:47,970
wowway I wonder how many make itself.
Probably a little bit of the shit out of

620
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:48,580
him.
Yeah.

621
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,413
Well you know some comic has a joke 
about texting a girl and the text 

622
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:54,750
message comes back and green and go damn
shit.

623
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,350
For true felt.
People have.

624
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,720
People want I message like if you're.
If you're messaging someone and you find

625
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:07,530
out it won't send an imessage will only 
send a text message like a Weirdo.

626
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,850
He's,
they have a flip phone,

627
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:11,130
like so weird eighth person.
I've been on the other side of that,

628
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:12,580
like I carry an iphone,
but I don't.

629
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,970
I text people on my android phone so 
I've never been on the uh,

630
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,070
judging side.
But I,

631
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,070
I wonder about that everyday.
Like really what does it matter?

632
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,510
Like I text you with a green bubble,
which apple decided,

633
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:25,344
first of all,
to differentiate I message versus text 

634
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:28,440
message,
which is hilarious.

635
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,270
Um,
what,

636
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,980
who cares?
What does it matter?

637
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,580
Does look better it,
I'm sure they decided to.

638
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,770
They I'm sure in a software update they 
tweaked that green to make it look extra

639
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:40,440
harsh.
They figured out,

640
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,260
they figured out with pool tables a long
time ago.

641
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,680
Like pool tables,
the cloth generally is green,

642
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,573
right?
But when they started playing in 

643
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,493
professional tournament's,
they realized that blue cloth is 

644
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:55,410
actually easier on the eyes and you 
could differentiate,

645
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,470
differentiate the edges better.
So a lot of really high end professional

646
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:03,300
matches are played on blue cloth now.

647
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,450
It's like a light blue sky blue cloth.
Yeah,

648
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,433
I've seen.
And that's I guess because of the way 

649
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:09,774
your eyes work,
like something about primary colors and 

650
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:14,370
the cones and you're more contrast and 
suited to blue.

651
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:16,480
Something like that.
I don't know about the way.

652
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,333
The way white contrast with green is not
quite as pleasing as white contrasting 

653
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,403
with blue,
but it could be the apple fucking with 

654
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:27,330
you with the green to give you some 
vomit.

655
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:29,580
Green.
Making some brand color next year.

656
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,280
Yeah.
The color of the APP is green.

657
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,960
What would they make it?
Blue.

658
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:34,794
I messaged the APP.
That button you press to open it as 

659
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,660
green.
It's a green though.

660
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,540
Why not make it blue?
That's really true.

661
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,980
Yeah.
What the fuck?

662
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,100
That's very good point.

663
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,520
Jamie.
Why did they do that?

664
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:46,354
It's still.
Why would it be green when you're 

665
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:49,630
sending blue messages?
Apple.

666
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,360
We'd dorks.
Steve jobs is dead.

667
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:53,950
You guys are fucked.
You don't know what you're doing.

668
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,430
But the mate book,
other than that,

669
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,413
it's supposed to have a better keyboard.
It's supposed to have a keyboard that's 

670
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:04,780
probably similar to that surface book 
and it's supposed to have better battery

671
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:06,060
life.
Bacillus,

672
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,831
yeah.
Bezel.

673
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:08,320
This touch screen,
touch screen,

674
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,380
higher resolution,
but you got to deal with windows 10,

675
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,570
which is a little bit of a pain in the 
ass.

676
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,750
I gotTa admit it's like the updates are 
almost daily.

677
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,763
There's something going on with firmware
or something going on with this or that 

678
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:21,694
or I've gotten used to it mostly though 
because most of what I do on my laptop 

679
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,103
is pretty web based,
so I'm just living in chrome or safari 

680
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:29,920
or whatever,
so it's not a big deal.

681
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,753
But then yet once I have to go out and 
I'm gonna go in light room and do some 

682
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:37,150
photo work and then like suddenly I'm 
digging through files and I'm in windows

683
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:37,984
and it's.
Then you start to feel like you're 

684
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,570
different.
Yeah.

685
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,780
When you first time you have to update a
driver.

686
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,560
Like what is it?
Nineteen 96.

687
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,510
The fuck is going on here.
I'm updating drivers.

688
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,880
I try to get away that it's just their 
clothes though.

689
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,880
Like it's way better than it was five 
years ago,

690
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,100
five years ago you would look at 
windows,

691
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:59,380
you'd be like,
this is some archaic.

692
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,410
Pixilated came from Vista to Windows 
seven to windows,

693
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:05,464
10 vista was kind of that nightmare.
And then they kinda have worked upwards 

694
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:09,414
since I started with windows 95.
I used to make my own computers back in 

695
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,414
my hardcore video gaming days.
Nice to go to fry's electronics and get 

696
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:19,750
motherboards and box and fans.

697
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,750
And I started that online so I never 
went to a physical computer store to buy

698
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:26,044
parts,
but I would have to do the whole like 

699
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,050
cross cross referencing what's 
compatible with what online and then put

700
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:32,884
together a whole list and then just buy 
it and then nine boxes show up and like 

701
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,550
hopefully they all work.
Yeah.

702
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,010
But yeah,
it was the same experience.

703
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,630
Yeah.
And sli,

704
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,540
video cards and connecting them with 
that cable and mess up in Brooklyn.

705
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,770
Oh yeah,
yeah,

706
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,773
yeah.
But fixing it makes you feel like you 

707
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,223
did something.
Well there's something going on when 

708
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:52,324
you're like the jumpers for the 
motherboard and you're moving stuff 

709
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:57,970
around.
And it was cool.

710
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,943
Yeah.
And then once you actually gone online 

711
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:02,180
with a computer,
you made yourself like this.

712
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,423
Something about this.
And I met her when you used to be able 

713
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:06,340
to do that with apple.

714
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,520
You used to be able to buy clones?
Yeah,

715
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,280
I mean my.
So I way back in the day,

716
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,090
still in high school I had a Dell xps 
like 7:30,

717
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:19,900
I think it was called is huge desktop 
where again you could like take this cpu

718
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:22,030
cooler out,
put a new one and it was modular fully.

719
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,820
And then apple also made this huge 
desktop,

720
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:27,940
this power mac or I don't know what it 
was called at the time,

721
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,840
but it was again massive.
You could take the graphics card out,

722
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,950
put a new one in,
you can take the ram out,

723
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,690
take the CPU out.
But it was like this,

724
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,803
this weird system where like they were 
on like decks and you had to like take 

725
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:40,190
this big

726
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,340
metal slot out and then do the Cpu there
and then put it back in.

727
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,570
It was really satisfying to like change 
the hardware and like yeah I did that.

728
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,520
And they put it up and it's like,
that's exactly right.

729
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:51,230
Now it's got eight gigs around the other
side.

730
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,220
Especially.
I don't know.

731
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:56,160
I think it's a man thing to men like 
changing carburetor,

732
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,010
mechanical field.
Yeah.

733
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,860
That's probably a lot to do with it too.
Yeah,

734
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,763
that's it.
One generation after that because that 

735
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,240
whole that it had like basically like 
elevator levels to it,

736
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,074
like the top level and on the bottom 
level and on the hard drives and the 

737
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,830
power supply and the top,
like all that stuff.

738
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,173
And he can mess with that.
If you go over someone's house and they 

739
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,140
have that now you're like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

740
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,003
But that's the thing about that was the 
most accessible modular desktop apple 

741
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:25,010
ever ever made.

742
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,500
And now they're making this promise 
again.

743
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:28,334
Like,
all right,

744
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,680
we listened,
we know that little trash can.

745
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:34,160
Mac Pro was not good thermally or design
wise for anyone.

746
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,790
So we're going to make a modular 
professional desktop Mac pro.

747
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:38,624
Again,
that's what they said and it's going to 

748
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:43,550
be next year sometime and I keep 
picturing that.

749
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,743
I picture them going back to the roots 
of like a real bonafide desktop because 

750
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:48,914
right now the most powerful imac or Mac 
you can get is the imac pro and you 

751
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,130
can't even update the ram and the Imac 
pro.

752
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,960
Really?
You can't update anything about Macra.

753
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,060
Really?
Yeah.

754
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,470
What you buys,
which you get,

755
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,140
if you buy a $7,000
imac pro,

756
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,303
you will have that spec forever.
Apple doesn't want you opening anything 

757
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:09,830
in that thing,
so when they say,

758
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:10,664
yeah,
we're going to make a modular updatable 

759
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,830
real well-designed apple desktop,
I'm like,

760
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:18,230
I really hope they're doing that.

761
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,240
Like exactly because that's.
I love that.

762
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,590
Do they have regular towers anymore or.
No?

763
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,320
Everything's an Imac.
They had that,

764
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:29,750
that little trashcan and then the Mac 
mini,

765
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,840
which is the longest since they've ever 
updated it.

766
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:34,790
I'm hoping they update it at the event 
this month,

767
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:35,624
but the Mac mini is the only other tower
they made and that Scott Laptop 

768
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:42,050
internals,
so not really a true desktop,

769
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,903
so everything is.
Is that just because of technology's 

770
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,853
advanced to the point where you can kind
of fit everything in the big screen of 

771
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,810
an Imac basically?
Yeah.

772
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:54,140
I mean the Imac,
they have those desktop internals in it,

773
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,510
but uh,
yeah,

774
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,200
like,
you're,

775
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,740
you're still going to be restrained by 
like how closed off that spaces,

776
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:03,190
how many fans I can fit in there.
Um,

777
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,710
so if they really want to do like a true
desktop,

778
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,560
they got to open it up and make it huge,
which is not very like apple.

779
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:11,840
So it's gonna be interesting to see what
they do.

780
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,393
Yeah.
Um,

781
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,390
um,
what is your,

782
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,000
what year is your laptop over there?
That's an older one,

783
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:17,834
right?
Is the last one before they added the 

784
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:22,820
track bar.
The last one that glows 20 slash 15.

785
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,400
Does yours have a dip at all?
To the keys?

786
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,820
Very,
very small,

787
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,683
but that's all you need.
All you need is a very small dip about 

788
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,130
flat.
As soon as they went with flat,

789
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:38,720
they fucked up.
There's a company that refurbishes

790
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,970
17 inch Mac books,
the big one,

791
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:46,580
the Mac daddy these a laptop would 
refurbish it and put a,

792
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,120
like a modern CPU in it.
They put a,

793
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,590
a big um,
SSD drive,

794
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,180
a one terabyte or two terabyte SSD 
drive.

795
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,840
So you deal with the solid state drive 
so it's instantly fires up.

796
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,820
Much more ram.
Much more everything.

797
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,153
Yeah.
That's what they call a desktop 

798
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:03,350
replacement laptop.
Yeah.

799
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,270
I was into that for awhile.
That was like one of my.

800
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,910
That's actually how I started my channel
was I bought a 17 inch laptop now.

801
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,783
I was trying to figure out which one 
strikes the balance of where I want to 

802
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:12,644
be with taking it off the dock once in 
awhile and walking around the house 

803
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:16,334
maybe,
but like planting it back here and it's 

804
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:19,400
my desktop.
It's a 17 inch screen.

805
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,330
That was where I started with HP.

806
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,490
If you're at the airport and you have 
like a canceled flight,

807
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,640
you could get a workout in just like 
lifting.

808
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,940
Nothing will probably have you go side 
to side.

809
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,800
That's the other thing that I was on the
plane with this.

810
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:38,010
This is like a 12 inch screen and every 
time the guy in front of me lean back,

811
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:41,040
he just smacked my laptop to like move 
it.

812
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,143
You really need like a 12 inch,
a nine inch screen probably to get away 

813
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:46,530
with what?
That's 12 inches.

814
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,900
Can you flip that around as a 12 or 13 
inch screen?

815
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,510
But it's like a taller three two aspect 
ratio.

816
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,650
So it's not like,
like the smaller,

817
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,543
a 16 by nine screen would be underneath 
like where that guy was hitting my 

818
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:00,810
screen.
So most of the bezels seems like it's on

819
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:02,180
the bottom.
Uh,

820
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,400
yeah.
Yeah.

821
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,980
So your,
your chat at the bottom here.

822
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,020
I mean it's pretty,
pretty good size basil,

823
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:10,550
but like I'm still hoping for like 
vesselis laptops.

824
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,583
What,
have you ever thought about going with 

825
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:13,414
the Walway?

826
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,120
Uh,
not really.

827
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:19,380
Mostly because I switched laptops so 
infrequently that I was just like,

828
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:21,300
if it's not massively better than the 
Mac book pro,

829
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,193
I don't really feel the need to switch.
This came on my radar in the last like 

830
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:30,830
two weeks and I decided to try it and 
it's been like worth the shot.

831
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:34,110
Like I'm really into it,
I'm probably going to switch back to the

832
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:34,944
Mac book pro in a little while.
Once I started to run up against things 

833
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,930
like this doesn't have USBC,
which is sad.

834
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,683
That's weird though that eventually 
that's going to bite me and when I do 

835
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm going to want to switch back,
but it's got

836
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,970
a new Microsoft laptop that doesn't 
have.

837
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:48,650
USBC.
Doesn't really make a lot of sense.

838
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,840
It doesn't at all why they do that.

839
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,600
I have no idea.
I want to ask.

840
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,110
It's a great laptop.
It doesn't have the charger.

841
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:56,944
Is this weird like it's not like magsafe
but it's this slot charger thing where 

842
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,853
it like goes in and out easily but also 
doesn't have a card reader also doesn't 

843
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,370
have like a lot of things that I kind of
hoped to laptop would have.

844
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,660
So yeah.

845
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:15,020
This thing is everything.
This thing is regular USB USBC.

846
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,480
This has one size Usb port headphone 
Jack and what it looks like

847
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,423
just as Htmi bias does not have that.
I'm a big fan of this thing and then 

848
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:26,004
they make a.
They make a 15 inch version of it as 

849
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,830
well.
This is the,

850
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,703
I guess

851
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,890
I don't know how big that is.
So what do you do?

852
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:36,370
Like mostly on the laptop because I know
he writing,

853
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,640
writing and then getting online.
Just online bullshit.

854
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,470
But yeah,
no software really.

855
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:44,440
I'm not really running anything other 
than writing programs.

856
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,210
Microsoft word which is native,
right?

857
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,680
Yeah,
yeah.

858
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,710
I mean you could probably get away with 
any number of laps,

859
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,553
similar laptops just like.
So at that point you basically pick the 

860
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,860
design you like best and if it has the 
ports you need then you're good.

861
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,820
But if you find yourself,
like if I'm a I like to do photo editing

862
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:04,030
a lot and so basically I have to have 
some way to read memory cards.

863
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,253
Mac book pro doesn't,
it just has a lot of USBC ports so I 

864
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:10,990
just have that dongle plugged into Usb 
card reader and then I'm good.

865
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,063
This one I'll have to get a USB card 
reader also for it and then get light 

866
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:15,854
room and then I'm good.

867
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,560
You'll have to get a regular USB card 
readers,

868
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,430
which is five years ago,
less common.

869
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:23,440
It's still easy to find,
but like it's Kinda Dorky.

870
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,300
Eventually it will be like 20 slash 20 
and I'm like,

871
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,220
I don't want this in 20.
20.

872
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,110
Yeah.
That raise your pro.

873
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,300
The razer blade pro that we were talking
about.

874
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:34,510
What's interesting about that is it has 
a track pad on the righthand side,

875
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,373
like a mouse because the mouse is on the
right and then it has this enormous 

876
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:42,640
keyboard and a mechanical keyboard,
which I'm a really big fan of.

877
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,040
I like those clicky.
True,

878
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,110
true desktop replacement.
Yeah.

879
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,730
Look at that thing.
Yeah.

880
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,490
Isn't an acid.
Plus look at all the cool colors.

881
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,450
I have the 15 inch with the RGB.
They love their rgb.

882
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,343
I still,
that's your razor thing because they 

883
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,880
have a phone now.
I don't know if you know the,

884
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,510
the razor phone to has rgb,
glowing backlight.

885
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,630
It's hilarious.
But it's,

886
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,330
that's,
that's their own aesthetic.

887
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,820
But um,
what is rgb stand for?

888
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,691
Just red,
green,

889
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:11,524
blue.
I like the fact that you can cycle 

890
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,430
between colors or whatever at any time.
Uh,

891
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,153
is almost almost pointless,
like it's technically a backlight which 

892
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:23,770
is useful,
but other than that you're just Kinda,

893
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,350
you know,
get into the Gamer aesthetic,

894
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:27,820
which is pretty fun.
Yeah.

895
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,571
It's,
well,

896
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:29,404
it's,
it's a fantastic thing if you're into 

897
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:32,404
games like that thing literally you can 
play high end games at very high frame 

898
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:38,014
rates and you know,
I don't know what kind of battery life 

899
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,330
it has.
Probably not that great.

900
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:47,520
It's a four k what's so much juice in so
much screen and that's.

901
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,740
So that's a four k laptop with a desktop
gpu in it,

902
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,610
size of four k model versus a full hd 
mode model.

903
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,200
And I think the fourK has a lower Max 
frame rate if I'm not.

904
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,990
So what is the difference in full hd 
model?

905
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,440
So I think the full hd model is a higher
100,

906
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:08,470
20 hertz,
10 80 p or probably 60 hertz,

907
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,313
four k.
So if you're gaming you'll probably go 

908
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:14,440
with the 10 80 p,
but then you get your higher frame rates

909
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:15,274
and you'll enjoy games better on that.
But if your photo editing than you'll 

910
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:19,864
probably go with the four k and you get 
that desktop power or video editing for 

911
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:24,950
example.
But,

912
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:25,784
uh,
I don't think the battery life would be 

913
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:30,760
very long on a four k laptop.
It's hard to imagine.

914
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:32,350
It's so big.
Yeah.

915
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,980
Like finding

916
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,140
out what it says in terms of the battery
life.

917
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,890
But like if you just playing a game and 
you're not plugged in,

918
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:40,950
you're kind of far.
Yeah.

919
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,290
If you're that,
if you're that guy,

920
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,390
you're walking around with the power 
cable all the time.

921
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:45,470
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

922
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,070
You're walking to a new room plugging it
in and then setting up there.

923
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,233
Yeah.
Which is better than a desktop 

924
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:51,800
technically,
but yeah,

925
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,570
you're walking around with the power all
the time.

926
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,880
Yeah.
Better than the desktop technically.

927
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:59,870
But is it as powerful as a desktop?
Like if you get a gaming desktop almost.

928
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,943
I think their goal is to get as close to
a desktop as they reasonably can and 

929
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:08,990
then give you the ability to take it 
places quickly.

930
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,410
What does it say about the,
uh,

931
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,643
oh,
you fucking motherfucker disable every 

932
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:17,120
website ever.
Everybody's popups.

933
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,400
Ugh,
so gross.

934
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,190
What could this world we live in now?

935
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,543
Why?
Why do I want notifications from your 

936
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:27,620
website?
So a great jeff the other day.

937
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,630
Am I saying that right,
Jeff?

938
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,863
Uh,
of like every website where like you go 

939
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:33,470
on to this,
you don't even get to the content.

940
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:35,870
It's just three hours,
52 minutes.

941
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:36,704
Battery life movie tests for just 
watching a movie that's still 100 

942
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:44,840
percent.
You Watch a movie and then it's dead.

943
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,420
That's hilariously low.
Yeah.

944
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,580
Because if you watch a movie on a Mac 
book pro,

945
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,060
like you got plenty of juice left,
the movie's over.

946
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,070
You might be able to watch three or four
movies.

947
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,500
The battery 99.
What?

948
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:59,870
Our battery.
That's actually huge battery,

949
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,270
but still.
Yeah,

950
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,370
that's one of the things that I liked 
about,

951
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,503
not this model of Lenovo,
but some of the pads have a swappable 

952
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:11,210
battery that you could swap wild.
That's a while it's on.

953
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:11,780
Yeah.

954
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,570
Oh,
what?

955
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,970
Yes.
Oh yeah.

956
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:15,050
I used to be able to do that.
Yeah,

957
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:15,884
that's definitely a barrier.
There's an internal battery and there's 

958
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,960
an external battery,
so you pop out the external,

959
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,190
but which is a big thick band plugged 
in.

960
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:23,024
You want to get the full Jamey that goes
like 25 fucking hours and if you pop 

961
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,530
that sucker out you could do it while 
this is still running yet and it doesn't

962
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:33,330
shut off.
Pop the new one in hot swapping?

963
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,780
Yeah.
Hot swap that.

964
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,900
I haven't had a laptop with that since 
like,

965
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,800
like uh,
seven years ago probably.

966
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:41,150
It's been a long time.
Yeah,

967
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,840
well I think thinkpads are mostly 
business oriented.

968
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,270
I mean that's really mostly what people 
are using them for.

969
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,070
Yeah.
But it's,

970
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:49,981
you know,
there's,

971
00:43:49,981 --> 00:43:52,370
there's that balance of like,
what are you looking for?

972
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,650
Like are you looking for something that 
can do everything?

973
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,000
Are you looking for something that's 
just.

974
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,043
I mean most people for a lot of people 
you could really get by with one of 

975
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:03,860
those Google chromebooks that doesn't 
have much storage at all.

976
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,520
That's where I'll probably end up 
getting my parents into a lot.

977
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,850
Like if your parents or grandparents 
don't really need much of a computer,

978
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,760
but all they need to do really is email 
someone,

979
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,810
maybe go to a website or to watch it 
online movie.

980
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,200
You just need a web browser.
So like a chromebook is great.

981
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,270
Yes.
So much is in the cloud.

982
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,400
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

983
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,600
So many people keep their photos in the 
cloud,

984
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:28,820
they keep it as long as you have an 
internet connection,

985
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:29,810
you're good,
you're good.

986
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,070
But in terms of like local storage,

987
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,360
yeah,
that's,

988
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,630
that's probably one of the things about,
especially when I was talking about this

989
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:37,464
phone,
not only does it only have four gigs of 

990
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,820
Ram,
it also only has 64 gigs of storage.

991
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,900
That's it.
Uh,

992
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:43,863
there's a 64 and a one slash 28 and 
there's a lot of phones now that have 

993
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:46,980
like 2:50,
six,

994
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,890
five,
12 and then expandable storage via micro

995
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:52,440
SD.
And the reasoning google is giving,

996
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:56,460
which I actually subscribed to you is 
everything just goes through the cloud.

997
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,990
Like the only thing I keep offline is my
spotify library and podcasts.

998
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,063
So my whole spotify,
whatever is like 30 gigs and then 

999
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:07,200
whatever podcast,
I have a couple more gigs.

1000
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,100
I don't need a 512 gig phone for 
everything.

1001
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:11,934
I usually keep offline.
I have a couple of big apps but not 

1002
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:15,030
really.
Uh,

1003
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:15,883
and,
and all the photos I take get uploaded 

1004
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:18,144
automatically to google photos in full 
resolution and I never really have to 

1005
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:23,184
keep all of them locally.
So every photo I've ever taken in full 

1006
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:26,334
resolution is on my phone,
even though I only have 128 gigs of 

1007
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:29,634
storage

1008
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,710
now when you use the Google version of 
like whatever I photo is,

1009
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:36,923
I photo uploads everything to the cloud.
It's really simple when you get a new 

1010
00:45:39,371 --> 00:45:40,640
phone,
everything loads up to it.

1011
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:42,020
Does the same thing happened?
Same thing.

1012
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,250
Google just as good.

1013
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,660
Yeah.
And you can use it on an iphone,

1014
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:45,560
which is.
You don't have to.

1015
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:46,640
But yeah,
real photos.

1016
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,683
I have google photos on my iphone,
so every time I take great photos on 

1017
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:51,320
this phone they're on my iphone.

1018
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,323
Oh,
that is actually not having the APP is 

1019
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,180
pretty useful.
That's nice.

1020
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,610
Yeah.
And I know there's a thing that's one of

1021
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:01,580
the things that people really love about
iphones is that airdrop feature.

1022
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:02,623
That's very nice.
That's one of the best apple only 

1023
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:07,260
features.
Yeah.

1024
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,060
But don't they have an android?
There's an android dropped to now I know

1025
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:16,061
that because I've used it to send things
from my Samsung phone to my apple phone.

1026
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,510
Um,
possibly.

1027
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:22,420
So there's,
it's not like a first party thing.

1028
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:23,254
So NFC is useful when I want to send 
something between two android phones 

1029
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:31,150
that NFC.
But this is something I recently,

1030
00:46:31,151 --> 00:46:32,890
I wasn't really using airdrop until 
recently.

1031
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:33,611
And then I was like,
oh wait,

1032
00:46:33,611 --> 00:46:34,444
I do have a Mac and an iphone.
I can just transfer transfer files back 

1033
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,310
and forth.
And I,

1034
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,020
we started doing that in the office a 
lot,

1035
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:41,883
which we,
we have a bunch of MACs and iphones in 

1036
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:44,044
the office.
So we started like passing files back 

1037
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:46,204
and forth.
And then one day I was trying to do it 

1038
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:48,610
on my android phone.
I was like,

1039
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:49,630
wow,
this is like a bummer.

1040
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:52,660
I have to go into like dropbox and 
upload it and then download it.

1041
00:46:52,661 --> 00:46:53,494
And it was just this couple extra steps 
were a pain and it made me really 

1042
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,030
appreciate how good airdrop is,
but

1043
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,043
they're just pretty good.
That was really good at making things 

1044
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:02,430
super simple.
Yeah.

1045
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,473
Like you don't,
you don't ever really have to update 

1046
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:08,310
things and until the ostp updates and 
it's pretty rare.

1047
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,230
Yeah.
Everything works really good.

1048
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,730
You don't really even worry about 
viruses or anything like that.

1049
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,470
Yeah,
there's a lot they do.

1050
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:18,870
That's really excellent.
Yeah.

1051
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,910
But I feel like the running on the 
momentum of Steve Jobs,

1052
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:26,150
maniacal vision.
Yeah.

1053
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,323
Yeah.
There's been a lot of apples changed or 

1054
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:34,390
apple is not the same sense since no 
more.

1055
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:37,210
Steve,
which is true obviously.

1056
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,780
Uh,
but they're also like their momentum,

1057
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,600
like how can you not like,
they're insane.

1058
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:45,190
They,
they're a trillion dollar company now.

1059
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:49,750
They continue to make iphones that look 
the same that they did nine years ago.

1060
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:51,790
Like why not,
you know?

1061
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,863
And if people keep buying them,
of course they'll probably never have a 

1062
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:55,164
reason to change.
It's just a different kind of company 

1063
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:57,611
now.
Before.

1064
00:47:57,611 --> 00:48:01,660
I mean he was like Jen generally 
regarded as an asshole,

1065
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,880
like just a crazy.
Yeah.

1066
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:05,260
Whip,
cracking.

1067
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,540
Micromanaging.
Yeah.

1068
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,413
Just just a nut.
Like there's that famous thing of him 

1069
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,100
trying to use.
I forget what the device was,

1070
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,620
but it wasn't used.
It wasn't working during one stage.

1071
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,410
Yeah.
I remember that live and he threw it.

1072
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:18,140
Yeah,
he was like did.

1073
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,660
It was casual,
but it was hilarious.

1074
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,320
It was like there was anger to it though
because someone definitely got fired.

1075
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:25,510
Like within minutes of that happening.
Yeah.

1076
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,430
And that's happened on stage.
Like things mess up on stage like yeah,

1077
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,980
it's going to happen.
For a couple of years ago there was a,

1078
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,843
an apple event or s I'm pretty sure 
Steve was on stage trying to get 

1079
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:37,384
something to work like in a demo and if 
you've ever been or seen like an apple 

1080
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:44,440
event,
like the entire audience or half of it,

1081
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,810
half of the audience is just people 
typing like blogging,

1082
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,673
like exactly what's going on.
So they're all connected to the 

1083
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,140
Internet.
They're live blogging.

1084
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:54,790
Yeah.
So Steve is like,

1085
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:57,130
get me one that works.
Look at his face.

1086
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,993
This is the thing like back that up a 
little bit and give me some volume like 

1087
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,853
this.

1088
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,650
You're gonna.
Take that,

1089
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,103
turn it on.

1090
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,420
Got It.
Well let's see if we can turn it on.

1091
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,910
There's an anger.
Yeah.

1092
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:17,840
Well you know,
he was like,

1093
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,920
Yo,
my speech after the show,

1094
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:23,320
he was definitely doing the.
Yeah.

1095
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,213
Yeah.
So there's another event where like 

1096
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,453
something wasn't working and he's like,
I need everyone in this room to turn 

1097
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:30,560
your wifi off so that this will work.
Everyone.

1098
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,800
I need everyone to stop blogging,
close your laptops,

1099
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:36,230
get off the Wifi and then this will 
work.

1100
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,510
And it was kind of like a,
a couple minutes of like,

1101
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,530
ha,
that's funny.

1102
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:40,663
Maybe is he serious?
And like slowly like everyone did close 

1103
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:44,740
out.
He's like,

1104
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,470
Eh,
everyone,

1105
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,303
everyone get off the Wifi,
everyone close your computers right now 

1106
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,940
and this is going to work.
And it was the issue.

1107
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,460
I don't remember exactly it was.
It was.

1108
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:54,500
Must have been some wireless related 
getting something to load or work.

1109
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,693
But that was pretty hilarious to me.
I feel like if you want things to 

1110
00:49:58,851 --> 00:50:01,610
operate at the speed of apple when he 
was alive,

1111
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:03,820
you kind of have to be a fucking crazy 
asshole.

1112
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,650
Yeah.
You have to have that next level.

1113
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,780
First of all,
I need a vision of what you wanted to be

1114
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,200
and then you need to be insane enough to
try to get people to do that.

1115
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,240
Well,
he also was according to.

1116
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,870
Is this it right here?
Yeah.

1117
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,900
Oh,
safari demo.

1118
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:18,743
Yeah.

1119
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,600
I don't know what's going on.
It's a four minute.

1120
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,093
But this is.

1121
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,790
Yeah.
So is failing to load.

1122
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,980
So everyone's using the local Wifi.
Wifi is just getting tagged.

1123
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,180
He isn't.
Wifi is getting crushed.

1124
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,850
So instead of verizon atnt

1125
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,570
okay.
Yeah,

1126
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,713
yeah.
You're just having Wifi issues that are 

1127
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,170
confronting moment where he said it.
We're actually unwind by here.

1128
00:50:59,171 --> 00:51:04,171
So at 20 minutes later Jesus.
Point number six.

1129
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,160
So yeah,
running around like crazy.

1130
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,340
We figured out why.
I'm like Damn,

1131
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:15,174
little crashed.
Why did it become more of a 575 base 

1132
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:23,961
stations operating in this room?
We can't deal with that either.

1133
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,733
I've got some really great that I'd like
to show you so we can turn off all the 

1134
00:51:32,711 --> 00:51:36,650
stuff and see the demos or we give up 
and I don't show you the demo.

1135
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:41,810
Would you want to see?
I'm thinking of hoping

1136
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,890
he'll just try again and then I'll have 
to turn it off.

1137
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,430
Yeah.

1138
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:51,430
Some of these things too by the way.
So all you need to turn off,

1139
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,153
turn off every notebook.
I'd like them to put them down on the 

1140
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,650
floor and all you look around and want 
you to help me see each other.

1141
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:02,440
Look at the end.
The whole crowd.

1142
00:52:02,441 --> 00:52:04,580
Is everyone.
The only reason they're there is to live

1143
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:05,414
blog.
Yeah.

1144
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,970
And put them on the floor please.

1145
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,600
All right.
One last tweet because

1146
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,960
he was telling me to turn the Wifi off.
Thirty minutes.

1147
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:20,030
Hey Johnny facetime.
That's another thing.

1148
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:20,630
Like

1149
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,970
facetime is another proprietary thing 
that apple has.

1150
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:26,390
It's really excellent and it's built 
into the contacts.

1151
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:28,080
It works perfectly.
Yeah.

1152
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,140
Yeah.
Just everyone with an iphone.

1153
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:32,210
You can do it with them.
Just Papao.

1154
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,740
I was like,
that's a massive vat and I message,

1155
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:36,574
or like two of the biggest reasons 
people refused to even try an android 

1156
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:41,030
phone,
so I'm like,

1157
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:41,864
all right,
well clearly google's mission should be 

1158
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:46,490
to get it message on Android,
right?

1159
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:50,720
Like that should be like a.
An apple will never let that happen.

1160
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,130
They know that they can hold people 
hostage on Ios as long as they want.

1161
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,293
If they can't get the message anywhere 
else and takes time and things like 

1162
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:00,050
that.
I imessage,

1163
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,790
facetime,
airdrop,

1164
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,630
walled garden.
Yup.

1165
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,033
Wonderful.
Walled Garden made a video about this 

1166
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,700
whole ecosystem.
It's A.

1167
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,710
It's real.
It's a real major advantage.

1168
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,150
Yeah,
it really is.

1169
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,223
And they've got that nailed.
They really do try to make their own 

1170
00:53:19,311 --> 00:53:20,960
versions of these things too.
Well,

1171
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,990
just like they tried to do google plus 
and everybody was like,

1172
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:24,930
yeah,
good luck with it.

1173
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,490
I have a friend who was an executive at 
Google.

1174
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:27,324
It was hilarious.
She was always telling me how great 

1175
00:53:28,741 --> 00:53:29,574
google pluses might.
That shit's dead in the water thing is 

1176
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:35,760
google plus Google plus even though only
like nine people used it.

1177
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,280
It was great.
I'm sure was really good,

1178
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,353
like all the things that they let you do
that I wish facebook would let us do 

1179
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,223
like sharing with certain groups of 
people and like all these different 

1180
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:47,550
things with circles.
It was kind of a shit show with like how

1181
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:49,440
they did it,
but it's good.

1182
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,880
Like it was good anyway,
so it's going to die now and that's kind

1183
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:53,340
of sad.

1184
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,570
It is killing Ya.
Yeah.

1185
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:57,120
They have this whole security breach 
thing,

1186
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,760
uh,
which is also a weird story.

1187
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:01,200
But then eventually they're like,
you know what,

1188
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:03,220
we're shutting it down.
Yeah.

1189
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,570
I want to call my friend up and go,
ha ha,

1190
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,543
I told you so it's going to be,
it's going to be finally no more google 

1191
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:13,170
plus.
But like Google keeps trying to do this.

1192
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,890
They keep calling it like a universal 
message service.

1193
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:17,671
Everyone's like,
oh,

1194
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,860
I messaged for Android,
you're going to make your own great.

1195
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:20,903
And then make a aloe duo hangouts.
Men like they have all these half 

1196
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,210
halfway there.
Things that kind of tie into android and

1197
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:34,040
are sort of like facetime and imessage 
but not really a.

1198
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,980
and it's just not well done and it's not
convincing anyone.

1199
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:38,843
Now I know there's been some third party
attempts to figure out how to put our 

1200
00:54:41,851 --> 00:54:42,684
message on android phones that you can 
get like some sort of an app that allow 

1201
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:51,990
you to use our message is probably 
really clunky and 40.

1202
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,730
Yeah.
I haven't tried that.

1203
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,950
I haven't either.
I imagine it's horrible.

1204
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,620
I have the note nine,
like I said,

1205
00:54:58,621 --> 00:55:00,750
and I was thinking about switching over 
to it and I was like,

1206
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,150
oh I'll use this pen.
I never use a pen once.

1207
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,260
Yeah,
that's,

1208
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,480
that's the thing.
I as a reviewer,

1209
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,373
I'm always trying to figure out what is 
a real genuine use it everyday feature 

1210
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,383
that's worth paying extra for.
And what is a cool demo feature that'll 

1211
00:55:16,141 --> 00:55:19,500
get you to brag about the phone and show
your friends but you'll never use it.

1212
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,023
And I've always been split on the s pen.
Is that a thing people really use all 

1213
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:25,584
the time?
And I've been like kind of somewhat 

1214
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:28,950
convinced.
There's people who like,

1215
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,450
yeah,
I use the s pen every day.

1216
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:33,600
I take notes on my phone,
I use that APP and I'm like,

1217
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:36,060
I try,
I try.

1218
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,070
I had this little point where I was 
like,

1219
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:38,904
yeah,
I'm going to do lock screen notes every 

1220
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:40,674
time I want to remember something,
I'm going to write it down and I just 

1221
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:43,764
never got into it.
So like I'm usually pretty good about 

1222
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:48,660
like dividing things into buckets of 
like,

1223
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,553
yes,
this is something we will use and is 

1224
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:52,770
worth paying.
This is dumb,

1225
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,693
but it's really cool to demo and it will
just sell people and they never use it 

1226
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:57,790
again.
Those two buckets are very clear.

1227
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:58,624
The yes pencil has been in the middle 
from the lock screen things weird too 

1228
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,710
because it doesn't work that smooth.
The lock screen known better.

1229
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,663
Yeah,
it's a little clunky and then you don't 

1230
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:10,020
just get it right there.
It saves it to notes.

1231
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,210
So you have to go to and you have to go 
to the notes APP.

1232
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,073
Yeah.
Yeah.

1233
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,640
Well,
what my thought was,

1234
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,863
I'm going to use this and I'm going to 
put my set list on my phone and that 

1235
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:22,950
where anytime I go to the lock screen,
the note setlist would be there.

1236
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,100
I'll just be able to scroll through

1237
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,880
my set list when I go on stage.
Yeah.

1238
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,900
But it doesn't work there.
No,

1239
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:30,640
I've got to go to the notes.
Well what is this then?

1240
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,780
Yeah.
Yeah,

1241
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:34,150
so it's just kind of weird halfway 
there,

1242
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,710
but I want to talk to someone who's 
like,

1243
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:36,544
yeah,
I buy the note every year because I got 

1244
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:39,710
to have the pen.
Like I got this.

1245
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,470
I think.
Well,

1246
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,304
one thing that is kind of cool about it 
that I've never used once but kind of 

1247
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:48,190
cool about it is the fact that you can 
use that pen as a remote control.

1248
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,053
That's definitely a take photographs 
firmly in the second bucket of like 

1249
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,700
great demo.
Yeah.

1250
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:54,534
Look,
I'm halfway across the room taking a 

1251
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:56,110
selfie.
That's cool,

1252
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:56,800
right?
Yeah.

1253
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,850
Yeah.
Then you'll never use it,

1254
00:56:57,851 --> 00:56:58,684
never use it.
And then also using it as a remote 

1255
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:04,180
control for music and for video you can 
map it to all kinds of crazy thing.

1256
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,160
It's actually a really well thought out 
feature.

1257
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,490
It gets Bluetooth and the s pen has its 
own battery now.

1258
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:10,324
So you put the battery in the phone and 
it charges the stylists very quickly in 

1259
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:16,240
a couple of seconds you get like half of
the battery.

1260
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:18,460
Like it's really well thought out.
Yeah.

1261
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,730
But am I ever going to use.
Probably not.

1262
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,860
Yeah.
The battery is huge too.

1263
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:24,723
It's got a 4,000
milliamp battery as opposed to the 

1264
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:27,130
Iphone,
which is what?

1265
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:28,960
30.
Even the big ones,

1266
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:31,870
like at 31 and $3,200.
Is that that little?

1267
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,300
Yeah.
But I mean like iphone.

1268
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:36,820
So I've never needed that.
The number on paper to be big to be well

1269
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,680
optimized because it's software 
software,

1270
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:43,390
but they've done tests where they did 
benchmark tests between the note and the

1271
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:46,410
iphone x.
What does it matter to tennis 10.

1272
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,710
Ask Max.
Yeah.

1273
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,793
I'm.

1274
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,430
It's not the.
The,

1275
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:52,000
the note crushes it.
Yeah.

1276
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:52,770
Yeah.
No,

1277
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,640
Samsung's getting better with 
optimization too,

1278
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,350
which is awesome.
That they crush it.

1279
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:57,184
They,
they used to be kind of scared of 

1280
00:57:57,971 --> 00:58:01,720
batteries in the notes.
I wonder why so that they finally gotten

1281
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:03,570
better at that and they're,
they're doing really well.

1282
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,483
It's amazing that they bounced back from
that at all because we'll fucking died 

1283
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,760
in A.
I don't think anyone died.

1284
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,380
Well,
some one guy,

1285
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,453
I don't know what happened to him,
but there was a famous guy who was a 

1286
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:18,160
tech guy who died because his battery 
exploded in his house,

1287
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,190
caught on fire and he died in the fire.
Really?

1288
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,910
I don't know what phone he was using 
though.

1289
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,650
He was some,
some,

1290
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,023
I don't think it was the note crypto 
currency guy not follow the note pretty 

1291
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:31,380
closely because that was.
I had a couple of them just because like

1292
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:33,370
I was in the middle of reviewing it and 
using it.

1293
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,800
I carried when everyday starts getting 
banned,

1294
00:58:35,801 --> 00:58:38,230
starts getting caught on fire.
You can't fly with it.

1295
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,540
Like I followed that all very closely 
and all of you.

1296
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:41,723
The cases of cause,
it started off with not only where the 

1297
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,153
note seven starting to explode,
but they started recalling them and 

1298
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:51,970
sending people replacements and then the
replacements started to explode.

1299
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:55,090
At that point I was like,
this is amazing.

1300
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:57,910
I need to follow very closely.
Uh,

1301
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,823
had a,
a blackberry and a y way and they don't 

1302
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:04,230
know which one exploded.
Probably walway assassination.

1303
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,880
I never.
It has a weird,

1304
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:07,714
actually wasn't ceo cradle fund ceo now,
just written Hassan song and it caught 

1305
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,820
his whole house on fire.
Yeah.

1306
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,410
He died after smartphones,
pulling catches fire in his bedroom.

1307
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,090
That is really extreme.
Yeah.

1308
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,920
Yeah.
Where to go.

1309
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,060
They can't mess around.
So like

1310
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,830
one that's when your phone starts 
exploding and you're Samsung,

1311
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:26,720
like you have to get,
you have to fix that.

1312
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,613
There was a famous video of the guy who 
parked his car in the driveway and put 

1313
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:33,320
his phone in the charger and left it 
there.

1314
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,620
And he came outside to his car bursting 
into flames.

1315
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,560
His whole car was on fire.
Oh my God.

1316
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:40,663
That's horrible.
Especially in a gas car with literal 

1317
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,580
flammable liquids in.
Luckily it wasn't in his garage.

1318
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,880
She was in his driveway.
That is net fuck.

1319
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:50,960
Yeah.
It's amazing.

1320
00:59:50,961 --> 00:59:52,970
They've bounced back from that though,
because they really have.

1321
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,170
Yeah,
they're actually,

1322
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:56,150
that's been impressive at their 
reputation.

1323
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,240
So like in the reviewer community of 
like,

1324
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,740
I watch it all my friends videos about 
the note when it came out,

1325
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:05,510
we stopped making explosion jokes.
This year I noticed that the galaxy note

1326
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:07,010
seven had all the explosion jokes.

1327
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,293
No eight came out,
all the explosion jokes last year it 

1328
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:13,130
exploded guys.
So what have they done this year?

1329
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:16,240
It's better now.
We're on no nine and I think we're kinda

1330
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,510
over it two years.
That's how long it takes.

1331
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:23,330
That's today though.
I mean the short cycle of news today.

1332
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:24,183
It's like things come and go so quickly,
but I wonder if that would've happened 

1333
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:27,734
to an iphone.
What kind of nightmare that would have 

1334
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:30,944
been.
I also think there's probably no way it 

1335
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:34,520
would have happened to an iphone.
Like you would think.

1336
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:36,950
There's no way what happened to Samsung,
but somehow it did.

1337
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:40,940
But like there's this whole process of 
like getting a battery supplier for your

1338
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:44,540
phone and then trusting their quality 
testing and then using that supplier for

1339
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:46,330
your manufacturing and all that.
Um,

1340
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,213
and I don't know how different that 
process is for Samsung versus other 

1341
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:55,610
manufacturers like apple,
but it just seems like apple would never

1342
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,100
let that sort of oversight slip bright.

1343
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,350
Hm.
I wonder,

1344
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,930
but if it did,
how crazy would that have been?

1345
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,310
Samsung comes out with new phones way 
quicker,

1346
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,290
right?
They,

1347
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,363
so they come out with phones more often,
but they update their lineups at the 

1348
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:11,984
same rate,
like once a year for note and also once 

1349
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,650
a year for galaxy s.
But since they're six months apart,

1350
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:21,950
it looks like they made four new phones.
So we're going to get a new phone.

1351
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:22,784
Every April galaxy has 10 will come out 
in April and they'll get galaxy note in 

1352
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:28,420
September.
Was like,

1353
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,950
well it's only six months.
Well that's part of a different lineup.

1354
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:31,784
So like galaxy s is every year.
Galaxy notice every year they have all 

1355
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:34,904
these other lineups.
So they didn't make a lot more phones 

1356
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:37,364
for sure.
And Are they still doing the sport 

1357
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,120
because they had that sport model 
active?

1358
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,980
Uh,
I think they are still.

1359
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:47,960
It's not nearly as special seeming to 
them as it used to be.

1360
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,390
They used to really like put a separate 
commercials for it.

1361
01:01:50,391 --> 01:01:51,224
And they have like all this hype.
I remember like Galaxy s seven active 

1362
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:56,570
was a big deal.
I don't even know if there is a galaxy s

1363
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:58,060
nine active,
I don't believe there is.

1364
01:01:58,061 --> 01:01:58,894
It might not be.
It was a rumor that it was coming out 

1365
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:03,230
and then it was going to be completely 
waterproof and shock resistant.

1366
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:05,310
It was going to have a rubberized case.
Right.

1367
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,360
And it was going to have an enormous 
battery life that didn't.

1368
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:12,470
They haven't released it.
The nine was going to have the same size

1369
01:02:12,471 --> 01:02:17,471
battery as the note nine,
but the regular size nine screen.

1370
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,010
So 4,000
million amp

1371
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,080
battery.
But in the s nine screen.

1372
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,120
Right.
Which would have been massive.

1373
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,530
Yeah.
I mean that's just.

1374
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,513
That would have been incredible.
I guess people just don't buy it as 

1375
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:30,570
much.
Yeah.

1376
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,840
I don't think people knew about it.
I think it's one of those deals.

1377
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,233
I love battery life.
I'm always scared that my phone's going 

1378
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:38,654
to run out of battery.
I know it's ridiculous because it very 

1379
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:41,160
rarely does,
but I'm always like,

1380
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:42,480
fuck,
what if it runs out of battery?

1381
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,363
Yeah.
When I hear about like the iphone's 

1382
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,430
battery not being so good.
I like,

1383
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,473
I've heard that the,
the x s regular has better battery life 

1384
01:02:53,781 --> 01:02:58,080
and the excess Max because Max has the 
larger screen.

1385
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:00,770
I think the,
I think they're about the same.

1386
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:01,933
I think that standby time on the tennis 
Max is better because of the bigger 

1387
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,520
battery.
But when you do use your screen a lot,

1388
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,640
they kind of diminished down to the same
number I think.

1389
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,410
And um,
the iphone 10 are,

1390
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:13,363
which I've just started using,
seems to have a battery battery life 

1391
01:03:15,231 --> 01:03:16,064
than both of them.
And this is the less expensive $750 ips 

1392
01:03:20,391 --> 01:03:23,270
lcd version of the iphone 10.
Yeah.

1393
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,290
The color is and all that.

1394
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,640
Now,
how much of a factor is that in everyday

1395
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,150
use?
Do you notice the difference?

1396
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:29,984
The battery life?
Yeah.

1397
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,560
No,
the,

1398
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,170
the image quality not being as good with
the different screen.

1399
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,700
Yeah,
that's the only factor,

1400
01:03:34,701 --> 01:03:36,410
right?
Of the internal components of same.

1401
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,800
They are the same as one gig of Ram 
weirdly,

1402
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:41,630
but yeah,
all the rest of the internals of what is

1403
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,493
a standard one half six,
so four gigs of Ram on every iphone 

1404
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:49,990
still and then three gigs in the 10 are.
And then also one camera instead of two.

1405
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:54,620
And then an aluminum rail on the side.
I call it a rail,

1406
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:56,840
but the outside's aluminum instead of 
stainless steel.

1407
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:59,330
So the iphone's got the shiny stainless 
steel outside.

1408
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,100
Uh,
the.

1409
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,740
Yeah,
the screen is still pretty decent.

1410
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:07,160
I know everyone likes to trash on it 
because it's only eight,

1411
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,080
20 8:00
PM,

1412
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,240
7:20
p screen roughly.

1413
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,300
This is the bar the are.
Um,

1414
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:17,390
but like using it or just looking at it,
it looks fine.

1415
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,820
And like an apple iphone eight.
Yeah,

1416
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,700
exactly.
It's the same pixel density as an iphone

1417
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:24,800
eight,
which was fine for most people.

1418
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,390
So if you get too caught up on the 
number,

1419
01:04:26,391 --> 01:04:28,700
which is not the typical iphone 10,
our buyer,

1420
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:29,960
then it's gonna.
Look bad,

1421
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,970
but if you just look at the screen and 
use it,

1422
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,220
which is most people walking in a store 
and just say,

1423
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,980
hey,
this looks fine and it's $250 cheaper.

1424
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:39,600
I think I'll just get this one.
That's why I think the 10 hours is going

1425
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:42,260
to be a great seller for Apple.
Yeah.

1426
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,123
It sounds like,
you know when you switch to those 

1427
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:45,584
battery pack cases,
that's now you have a brick in your 

1428
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:50,180
pocket.
That's huge.

1429
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,210
Yeah.
That's a big phone already too.

1430
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:56,390
So a six point one inch screen on that 
10 hour and then this big battery on the

1431
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:57,860
back yet it's just going to be massive.

1432
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:58,880
Yeah.
I don't know.

1433
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:03,410
I mean I haven't seen any excess Max 
with a case that has a battery in it,

1434
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:07,550
but shoes I wouldn't even try finger 
pocket anymore,

1435
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,130
but it's great if you go on a trip 
somewhere and you.

1436
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,850
You might be in some Janky plays.
It doesn't have.

1437
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,620
Yeah.
Power like a travel version

1438
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:18,953
of your setup.
Yeah.

1439
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:22,030
Yeah.
It's a big old brick case.

1440
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,430
Yeah.
Well not a case person.

1441
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:27,110
Yeah.
You don't have any cases onto cases you,

1442
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,680
but you switched phones so often.
Even if you drop them.

1443
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,930
That's what people say.
Papa Sim card out.

1444
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:33,790
I still take good care of my phones.
People are like,

1445
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:34,624
Oh,
you get a new phone every two weeks you 

1446
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,514
might be right,
but I still take really good care of my 

1447
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,540
phones.
I actually did kind of getting out of my

1448
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,490
car,
the slid out of my pocket,

1449
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:43,983
which is kind of a nightmare and it took
one bounce before I like sort of half 

1450
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:47,524
caught it.
So I got these little scratch on the 

1451
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:50,830
corner.
That's google phone,

1452
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:52,360
Google phone,
but it's fine.

1453
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,890
So I always questioned people that don't
have cases.

1454
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,411
I'm like,
Oh,

1455
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:59,130
you're one of those people.
My friend Andrew Santino,

1456
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,740
he doesn't put a case on anything and I.
He didn't have like a good.

1457
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,620
He was a more a design person who's 
like,

1458
01:06:05,621 --> 01:06:08,110
look how beautiful this case in this.
That's part of it.

1459
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,170
But Neil degrasse Tyson had a really 
interesting perspective.

1460
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,183
He said he takes his case and he flips 
it around in his hand constantly and he 

1461
01:06:15,731 --> 01:06:18,400
said,
if you go to like watch like cadets when

1462
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:19,234
they're learning how to handle guns,
they're spinning their gun around and 

1463
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:23,620
catching it goes,
why do you think they're doing that?

1464
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,940
They're doing that so that they're 
always able to catch their gun no matter

1465
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:30,450
what.
They have the suit.

1466
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:35,490
He takes his phone and he flips it 
around his hand like a cadet.

1467
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,000
That's awesome.
Guess my phone and he showed me.

1468
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:41,500
He was like flipping in between his 
fingers,

1469
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:42,610
like,
oh,

1470
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:44,710
I like seat,
but that's him.

1471
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,090
He's got this next level thought process
behind everything.

1472
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,680
That's fair.
Not having a case.

1473
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:53,050
That means he's not a case person.
He's always got his phone.

1474
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:53,680
Yeah,
that's fine.

1475
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,710
I actually like your case,
this case,

1476
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:01,390
which is a clear case and the reason why
I like it is because it's more grippy in

1477
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:02,590
your hand.
It just.

1478
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,360
There's more to it.
I found a slippery.

1479
01:07:05,361 --> 01:07:07,600
I phones are these slippery as phones,
their.

1480
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:08,434
The way they're shaped,
they have the stainless steel and then 

1481
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:10,834
they kind of just melt into this orb 
shape and it's by far the most common 

1482
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:16,750
like slide out of my pocket phone is the
iphone.

1483
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,060
This phone was never slid out of my 
pocket obviously.

1484
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,340
And the one plus.
Yeah.

1485
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,310
You said that that was your favorite 
phone before the Google Pixel three?

1486
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,313
Yup.
Why do you like the Pixel three better 

1487
01:07:27,731 --> 01:07:28,564
than that phone?
Because I've heard great things about 

1488
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:30,694
the one plus.
I love the one plus still and I would 

1489
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:33,094
have no problem using it today,
but this camera is so much better than 

1490
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:36,940
every other phone.

1491
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:37,773
Yeah.
Now is that because you took a lot of 

1492
01:07:38,981 --> 01:07:43,000
photos for youtube and blogging and that
kind of thing?

1493
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,050
Yeah,
just social.

1494
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:44,884
I tweet a lot of photos.
I instagram a lot of photos and I just 

1495
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,750
much better.
Yeah,

1496
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,960
that's much better than the one plus,
which is already a $600 phone and is the

1497
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,140
one plus what?
I mean.

1498
01:07:56,141 --> 01:07:56,974
The,
the galaxy note nine was supposed to 

1499
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:00,520
have a very good cameras.
Well,

1500
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,020
I can't tell the difference.
I'm not good enough.

1501
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,273
You most people won't until you put them
next to each other and then you kind of 

1502
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:08,411
go,
oh,

1503
01:08:08,411 --> 01:08:09,244
interesting.
There's a much like when you put an 

1504
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:13,780
iphone photo next to a pixel,
photo,

1505
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,880
iphones have matory

1506
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,680
great cameras.
Pixels have notoriously great cameras.

1507
01:08:18,681 --> 01:08:20,000
You might be totally fine with either 
one,

1508
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:20,834
but if you put them next to each other,
you will notice massive differences 

1509
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:24,770
between the cradles.
Yeah.

1510
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,760
So did you notice comparisons that are 
online that we could pull up right now?

1511
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,410
Um,
my last one,

1512
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:35,411
I compare it a pixel to,
to iphone 10 to one plus five t,

1513
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,080
two,
two other phones.

1514
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:42,470
I did it like a five camera blind test.
And what I did was I put the five photos

1515
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:45,060
next to each other but didn't tell you 
which one is which ne B,

1516
01:08:45,061 --> 01:08:45,894
c,
d or e.

1517
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,960
and you go down the list and I have like
seven,

1518
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:49,190
eight,
nine photos in a row,

1519
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:49,591
a,
b,

1520
01:08:49,591 --> 01:08:50,001
c,
d,

1521
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,080
or e,
pick your favorite one.

1522
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,333
A lot of people went with b.
A lot of people went with D and they 

1523
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:54,620
didn't know which one.

1524
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:58,190
It was not the end I revealed which one 
was which,

1525
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,200
and a lot of people were surprised by 
which one they picked.

1526
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:02,750
Oh,
I picked the pixel over the iphone every

1527
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:03,770
time.
Really interesting.

1528
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:04,943
Uh,
and a lot of times when you put them 

1529
01:09:06,201 --> 01:09:09,170
side by side,
you'll notice like iphones like to boost

1530
01:09:09,171 --> 01:09:11,590
the shadows a lot more so that they're 
much more immediately lit.

1531
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,310
Yeah.
This is that side.

1532
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:14,300
So like if a,
b,

1533
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:16,630
c,
D and e,

1534
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,720
which one do I like better?
And I already can tell immediately which

1535
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:23,390
ones the pixel.
And you might not because Iraq,

1536
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:28,130
I remember Pixel two had cooler colors 
and more contrast than any other one.

1537
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:30,650
And this is a backpack.
Yeah.

1538
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:32,263
So another thing about these is it helps
to see it in a high resolution because 

1539
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,343
the difference in detail and sharpness 
between them is another thing I paid 

1540
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:40,430
attention to.

1541
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,610
Which ones he,
I want to say that was the one plus,

1542
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:44,444
but I forget now.
I'm pretty sure be as the pixel because 

1543
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:48,254
this backpack is starting to look a 
little bit blue and that was a big 

1544
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:51,794
characteristic of the pixel two from 
last year and that was a big issue with 

1545
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:59,450
the screen as well.
Right to the Pixel xl?

1546
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:00,343
Yeah.
Look at this contrast like you see like 

1547
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:02,654
all these are like pretty good,
but when you see B and you see how much 

1548
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:08,270
more contrast that has and you look at a
and how much it's lifted.

1549
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:09,710
The shadows.
Yeah.

1550
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,573
He's got.
He's got a pretty even tone and is also 

1551
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:15,200
the one plus.
I don't remember what it is.

1552
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,710
I'd have to go back to the video,
switched them around one every time.

1553
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:21,290
It was the same as the same every time.
B is the same every time.

1554
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:24,260
I know I'm already pretty sure that B is
the pixel.

1555
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,420
Go to a,
go to the top left one with the selfie.

1556
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,610
So again,
like that gray sweatshirt,

1557
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:34,910
it starting to look at blue and be right
in.

1558
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:37,070
He become much higher,
brighter.

1559
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:37,904
Those shadows are like my black hair.
It looks kind of gray at that point in 

1560
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:41,893
that one.
So there's a lot of things you don't 

1561
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:47,000
notice until you put them side by side.
But so nitpicky,

1562
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:50,570
they all look so good.
They all look pretty much like the same.

1563
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,670
So you never see your little parallel 
syrup?

1564
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,440
Yes.
See is a little bit tighter.

1565
01:10:54,441 --> 01:10:56,430
So I'm gonna go see as the iphone 
because the iphone has,

1566
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,630
has a,
a little bit of a tighter selfie camera.

1567
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,393
A lot of android phones have a wider 
angle selfie camera because you can fit 

1568
01:11:03,891 --> 01:11:04,724
more people in them.
But apple's always told me they go with 

1569
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:09,230
a tighter angle because there's less 
distortion and they want it to feel more

1570
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:10,064
natural.
You just take a picture of yourself and 

1571
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:11,834
you look great.

1572
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:15,720
Here we go.
Iphone X.

1573
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,540
Okay.
So you know it too in hassle.

1574
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,130
But I did add a real camera into the.
Into the mix.

1575
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,450
Can I wrote was preferred good?
Yeah,

1576
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:25,980
I hope so.
It's $10,000.

1577
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,470
That was a real camera.
Better look.

1578
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,340
Pretty good film or is that a or?
It's a photo.

1579
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:33,870
So it's a.
it's a medium format.

1580
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:36,540
Fifty Megapixel Hasselblad,
[inaudible].

1581
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:37,403
It's a crazy camera.
Iphone x was pretty God damn good right 

1582
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,050
there.
It does,

1583
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,770
but there's just a little bit more to 
the Pixel to pixel.

1584
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:46,470
Two has.
So this is a portrait mode comparison.

1585
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:47,423
So I remember I was trying to test like 
the blurry background versus an actual 

1586
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:51,474
good camera.
And whenever you look at these portrait 

1587
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:54,354
mode photos,
what they're doing is they're sort of 

1588
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:56,184
trying to outline the subject,
keep it sharp and then blur the 

1589
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:00,444
background artificially and year after 
year they've gotten better at this 

1590
01:12:02,821 --> 01:12:06,690
because the fall off between the blur 
isn't just like a cut out in real life.

1591
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,320
You get sort of like a gradient of how 
much blur you have.

1592
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:11,543
So Pixel two has typically the sharpest 
cut out and the best like separation 

1593
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:20,460
between the background where the iphone 
kind of just takes the face,

1594
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:24,270
keeps the face sharp and then sort of 
has a more natural fall off.

1595
01:12:24,271 --> 01:12:29,271
So your body might not be at infocus uh,
and note eight as it's just not as good.

1596
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,860
Yeah.
And that image,

1597
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,550
that's a really,
that in that one you really see how good

1598
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:36,880
the pixel two is.
Yeah.

1599
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,420
Like that.
And so it takes all three.

1600
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:41,940
Got Better at that actually.
Yeah.

1601
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,530
So.
And now you can change.

1602
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:44,364
Something note was doing last year.
You can change how blur the background 

1603
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:49,380
is.
So an iphone 10 s now pixel three,

1604
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:50,580
note nine,
all of them.

1605
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:52,620
You can change how blurry the background
is.

1606
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,040
Now I noticed you have an apple watch on
though.

1607
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,200
I do that Smart Watch and the game,
which is I'm a is by a lot by a lot.

1608
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,753
By Lot.
Yeah.

1609
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,120
That's why I'm an iphone person really 
because of the watch.

1610
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:10,560
I carry two phones all the time.
An android phone of choice and an iphone

1611
01:13:10,561 --> 01:13:11,394
of choice.
So my android phone of choice is my 

1612
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,820
pixel.
That's the main number.

1613
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,713
The main phone I usually use a and my 
iphone of choice of carry because 

1614
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:20,024
there's still things that I.
iphones do better and I always carry 

1615
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:23,970
whatever the best iphone is.
A lot of things.

1616
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:27,070
It's media related.
It's like whenever I'm airdropping,

1617
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:28,650
like when I'm publishing a video on the 
go,

1618
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:30,540
like I have the thumbnail from airdrop 
on this phone,

1619
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,720
but just things like snapchat and 
Instagram,

1620
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,613
instagram stories and instagram live a 
lot of apps with camera stuff or better 

1621
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:40,644
optimized on the iphone than they are on
any android phone because they're built 

1622
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:44,484
for iphone.

1623
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,880
So I carry an iphone and the best smart 
watch is the Apple Watch stories for.

1624
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,680
So I wear an apple watch series for 
[inaudible].

1625
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:54,330
It's good.
It's really good.

1626
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,900
But you don't get text messages on your 
Apple Watch them now?

1627
01:13:57,901 --> 01:13:58,940
I don't,
but I,

1628
01:13:58,941 --> 01:14:01,460
I do.
Uh,

1629
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:02,430
yeah,
kind of.

1630
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:07,500
I would love to be able to use a 
smartwatch and this good with my android

1631
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:10,440
phone A.
I still haven't found one that good,

1632
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,510
but I'm mainly.
I'm using this for fitness tracking now,

1633
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,613
which is kind of entertaining.
Just like keeping track of workouts and 

1634
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,170
calories and standing hours and all this
stuff.

1635
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:21,004
It does,
it's pretty cool.

1636
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,023
Yeah.
This

1637
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:25,160
talking to you before the show,
but the sober October fitness challenge,

1638
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,650
we're doing this the first time I've 
ever worn a heart monitor.

1639
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:30,140
And then the scene,
actual scores,

1640
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,233
yeah,
there's a real crazy motivating factor 

1641
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:35,270
of seeing an actual number.

1642
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:36,163
The game of gamifying of fitness is 
really entertaining to me and that's 

1643
01:14:40,371 --> 01:14:41,204
what's kept me like,
I've usually don't wear a smart watch 

1644
01:14:43,221 --> 01:14:44,054
for very long,
but I think it's been about a month and 

1645
01:14:45,351 --> 01:14:46,184
I just keep like.
So there's a feature now where you can 

1646
01:14:48,111 --> 01:14:48,944
challenge people to a one week long 
challenge to whoever burns the most 

1647
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:56,330
calories and it has the most points or 
whatever it was like a point system.

1648
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,253
Right.
And that gamification of fitness has 

1649
01:14:59,181 --> 01:14:59,931
been,
I think,

1650
01:14:59,931 --> 01:15:01,760
pretty special.
It's been pretty good.

1651
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:05,090
Well this contest has been really crazy 
with me and my friends.

1652
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:05,990
So what are you trying to do?

1653
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,300
We,
if the winter is going to get a belt,

1654
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:12,640
like a wwe style belt.
Nice.

1655
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:17,641
It says intergalactic sober October 
champion and it has like

1656
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,080
marijuana leaf with the line through it 
and a bottle of booze,

1657
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,280
the line through it.
And uh,

1658
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:26,000
you were these things.

1659
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,500
It's a,
it's called a mile zone and it,

1660
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,260
it works with an APP.
It works pretty good and it,

1661
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:38,910
it registers your amount of your heart 
rate,

1662
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,540
the amount of calories you burn and it 
gives you a point system.

1663
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:44,500
And the point system is,
I don't know what it,

1664
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:47,190
what they call it's m e P eps.
I don't know what it stands for,

1665
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,413
but this is the amount of points over 
the month is what everyone's shooting 

1666
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:54,570
for.
Right.

1667
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:55,403
And so today were at October the 23rd,
so we have eight days to go and I have 

1668
01:16:01,411 --> 01:16:02,244
worked out more in these 23 days than I 
have in the last six months and I'm not 

1669
01:16:06,121 --> 01:16:07,110
exaggerating.
Yeah,

1670
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,170
I put in five and a half hours 
yesterday.

1671
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:13,230
Hard.
I got more than 900 points.

1672
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,273
Then after the podcast I said fuck it,
we're going to go for another hundred 

1673
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,530
and I worked out and I've got another 
100 points.

1674
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,860
Put in another hour.
It's maniacal because you,

1675
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,940
you actually see the number and because 
I could see the number,

1676
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:30,540
I could see all my friends' numbers and 
I'm way ahead.

1677
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:31,374
So I'm what I'm.
I'm just keep telling them that I'm 

1678
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:35,700
twisting the blade because I'm so far 
ahead.

1679
01:16:35,701 --> 01:16:36,534
Like right now,
I am 1500 points away from everybody 

1680
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:42,780
else.
All births trying to work out again,

1681
01:16:42,781 --> 01:16:45,930
that Slob.
So when you see somebody catching up,

1682
01:16:45,931 --> 01:16:46,860
you're like,
well I better hit the gym.

1683
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,510
Exactly.
Yeah.

1684
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,513
And so I'm,
I'm planning on staying so far ahead 

1685
01:16:51,631 --> 01:16:54,510
that they must die in order to beat me 
and

1686
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:55,523
the iphone or the Apple Watch when you 
have people connected with the fitness 

1687
01:16:58,801 --> 01:16:59,634
part of it,
it will literally notify me when one of 

1688
01:17:01,471 --> 01:17:05,760
my friends has finished a workout and 
tell me like how good there were,

1689
01:17:05,761 --> 01:17:08,610
how many points they just got as they 
finish it.

1690
01:17:08,611 --> 01:17:10,640
Like you,
you hit the finish button and you know,

1691
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:13,520
everyone's getting a notification like 
that's interesting.

1692
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:16,160
So I'm going to put in the extra four or
five miles on the bike.

1693
01:17:16,161 --> 01:17:19,160
So they get that notification that I did
that and that really does work

1694
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,013
work.
Yeah.

1695
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:22,210
I mean there's no doubt about it.
Yeah.

1696
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:27,010
Just having that external motivating 
factor and then seeing a number.

1697
01:17:27,011 --> 01:17:29,350
There's something about like with this,
with the meps,

1698
01:17:29,351 --> 01:17:31,300
mtps,
whatever the fuck that stands for,

1699
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:33,050
find out what that stands for.
I don't even know what that stands

1700
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,750
and I don't know how the Apple Watch 
measures points either.

1701
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,610
I think there's a.
because it's measuring.

1702
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:39,230
I mean there's a lot of sensors in this 
thing,

1703
01:17:39,231 --> 01:17:42,080
so not only as a heart rate monitor,
there's an accelerometer and a gyroscope

1704
01:17:42,081 --> 01:17:46,540
so it knows when you're standing,
knows when you're moving quickly and I.

1705
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:50,310
It basically just comes up with a points
number at the end of the day and I.

1706
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:52,910
Every time I fly I just don't get any 
points because I just sit there.

1707
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,080
Right.
But yeah,

1708
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:54,914
there's like a live counter constantly 
going of like you and your friends and 

1709
01:17:59,631 --> 01:18:00,710
you got to have the highest number.

1710
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:05,090
So out of all the stuff that you do 
during my zone effort points,

1711
01:18:05,091 --> 01:18:06,470
that's what it is.
That's the maps points.

1712
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,513
But here's the thing about that maps 
points and we were trying to figure out 

1713
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:10,274
why it does.
It gives you the same amount of points 

1714
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:15,740
for 80 percent of your Max heart rate as
it does for 90.

1715
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,753
So like the first day I said I'm just 
going to sprint and try to bury these 

1716
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:20,444
guys.
So I put them in 90 percent for 35 

1717
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:24,620
minutes.
I was like,

1718
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,483
they can't do that.
I'm just going to do some shit they 

1719
01:18:26,511 --> 01:18:27,344
can't do,
but it doesn't give you any more points 

1720
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:31,250
for 90 percent.
Ninety percent gives the exact amount of

1721
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:33,340
points is 80 percent.
So it's there on proprietary.

1722
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:36,170
See those two?
They're fibers piece of shit.

1723
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,760
So uh,
it's so dumb.

1724
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,683
So I think the reason why they did that 
as to keep people from killing 

1725
01:18:40,581 --> 01:18:41,750
themselves,
that's what I think,

1726
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:43,203
which makes just get somewhere in the 80
to 90 range that Bert is always in the 

1727
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:49,730
two and three fat bird never gets in 
yellow.

1728
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:52,580
That slob,
he just modeling around,

1729
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,720
waddling around with blue and green.
Mostly gray gets a lot of gray.

1730
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:59,870
He'll get gray for hours,
just waddling complaining,

1731
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:02,570
thinking about vodka,
dreaming about food.

1732
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:05,980
He's going to watch this and hit the gym
immediately on the gym.

1733
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:06,913
The Gym right now,
he's at the gym right now trying to 

1734
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:11,900
catch up.
So always playing catch up.

1735
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,640
Yeah.
The thing you gotta stay,

1736
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:17,710
you gotta stay ahead like yeah,
when you fall behind in the distance,

1737
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,300
you got to think of them as wolves 
barking in the distance,

1738
01:19:20,301 --> 01:19:21,134
chasing it like no fucking way.
You're not eating me bitch wolves 10 

1739
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:24,884
miles away and not going to get you,
but wolves a hundred yards away they 

1740
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,350
they're going to get now they're going 
to kiss you.

1741
01:19:29,351 --> 01:19:30,021
You gotTa,
you gotTa.

1742
01:19:30,021 --> 01:19:33,460
Keep the distance 10 miles away too far.
Ten miles that you want to hear.

1743
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:36,600
Okay.

1744
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,480
You don't want to.
You want to be at least just slob.

1745
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:42,360
He said he's going to double everything.
I do.

1746
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,640
Look at fat face.
That's not even possible.

1747
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:48,480
I brought my dog up here to fuck you.
Yeah,

1748
01:19:48,481 --> 01:19:49,790
baby.
It's all so broken.

1749
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:54,460
Stop this before I throw up the dog.
He's so far behind.

1750
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:57,970
It's impossible to win,
but that's the point.

1751
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,030
The point is to keep the.
To keep the boot on his neck.

1752
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,100
Yeah.
This is.

1753
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,800
This only does seven day challenges,
so you basically like you get,

1754
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:08,130
you start it and they accept then 
accounts for the next

1755
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,810
seven days,
all your cumulative points.

1756
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:11,063
Well that would be good.
Then you just do for and they can just 

1757
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:13,610
keep going.
Yeah,

1758
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:14,480
yeah.
Over.

1759
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,500
Yeah.
That's.

1760
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,290
I like the challenge aspect of it.
It's really mean.

1761
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:21,060
All jokes aside,
it's been really fun with my friends.

1762
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:23,520
Poor Tommy Buns,
way behind what was going on.

1763
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:29,390
Thomson [inaudible] way behind.
He's like 1800 points behind me.

1764
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:32,400
Warn them up as he like saving for a 
couple of days.

1765
01:20:32,401 --> 01:20:33,980
Might be,
might be sandbagged.

1766
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,210
Then just comes full strength all day.
You saw you store them up in,

1767
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:43,320
you're in this device and then you sync 
so you can pretend that you're not doing

1768
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:45,190
any work.
It could sand bag.

1769
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,920
Yes.
No one knows.

1770
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:49,560
Then the last day,
like you son of a bitch shows online.

1771
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:50,710
He's 10,000
points ahead.

1772
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:52,260
Oh,
just a real issue.

1773
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:56,070
So the key is just keep the work rate at
an almost impossible level.

1774
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,420
So like yesterday,
like I said,

1775
01:20:57,421 --> 01:21:02,190
I worked out five and a half hours and 
then another hour and today I've already

1776
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,290
put in two hours and put in two hours at
7:00

1777
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:06,690
this morning.
So I tell her it doesn't have any.

1778
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,600
The thing is I'm putting two hours in at
yellow,

1779
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:12,750
I'm hitting 80 percent for two hours.
Fat Burn out,

1780
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,690
they're waddling around with his dog 
pretending he's working hard,

1781
01:21:15,691 --> 01:21:17,220
making videos.
That's,

1782
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,950
he's got like gray and a little bit of 
blue.

1783
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:23,370
He maybe green who agree and then he 
takes a break.

1784
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:28,640
Cries and his numbers are low.
They're lower than mine.

1785
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,410
That's a fact.
I worked out more yesterday,

1786
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,470
last night and this morning.
Then he has an a whole day.

1787
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,710
He knows my problem when I,
I play Frisbee,

1788
01:21:40,711 --> 01:21:44,460
so I take the watch off when I played 
because it's a risk thing.

1789
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:46,090
I'm constantly mutating.

1790
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,250
Play like Frisbee disc.
Ultimate Frisbee.

1791
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:51,200
Ultimate Frisbee.
Yeah.

1792
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:54,840
So I take it off every time I play and I
know that's thousands of points that I'm

1793
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:55,674
missing out on.
What is disc golf versus ultimate 

1794
01:21:57,331 --> 01:22:01,020
Frisbee disc golf is what it sounds 
like.

1795
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:01,854
There is,
you play nine or 18 holes and you're 

1796
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:08,550
throwing in,
walking up or you throwing a Frisbee and

1797
01:22:08,551 --> 01:22:09,384
look at you.
They're gonna.

1798
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:12,120
Get an Air Sun.
So ultimate Frisbee is different.

1799
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:17,121
Ultimate Frisbee you can think of as 
kind of like football slash basketball,

1800
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:21,360
throwing that Frisbee with the left and 
the right hand.

1801
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,100
Yes.
Mostly one end.

1802
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:23,963
Sometimes you throw a little offhand.
Why don't you switch the sucker to the 

1803
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,550
lefthand?
Uh,

1804
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:28,500
it's,
I don't know,

1805
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:29,334
there's something about wearing 
something on my wrist of like throwing 

1806
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:34,200
and catching and it's just not.
You're so serious about it.

1807
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:35,830
You're willing to lose points.
Yeah.

1808
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:38,550
I,
if I really had to wear it for a week to

1809
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:42,060
get really playing competitive here.
Yeah.

1810
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:42,923
So this is all,
I'm pretty sure this is all pro 

1811
01:22:43,921 --> 01:22:46,380
highlights,
but you guys are pro.

1812
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,273
There's professional ultimate Frisbee 
now and you're playing professionally 

1813
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:52,080
and I'm playing professional.
Ultimate Frisbee.

1814
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:56,310
Whoa.
This actually looks really fun.

1815
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,950
Yeah,
there's a lot of.

1816
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,770
Is that you?
Two Thousand Sixteen Eastern Conference.

1817
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:05,380
Defensive Player of the year.
I was a baby.

1818
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,020
Mark has gone again.
Some would you have big hands?

1819
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:09,640
I probably helps in this sport.
Right.

1820
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:11,770
Definitely.
This is a fun play.

1821
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,510
Look at this.
I want.

1822
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:17,880
Oh,
snatch that guy that I just roofed,

1823
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:20,250
scored like 15 points against the 
psychologist called,

1824
01:23:20,251 --> 01:23:23,440
which is a lot.
I just roof to roof to roof.

1825
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:26,830
Is that an ultimate Frisbee?
There's all kinds of uh,

1826
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:27,451
there's,
yeah,

1827
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:28,284
there's a term for a common one is you 
skyride someone but roofed I like 

1828
01:23:32,551 --> 01:23:34,470
because it's a disc and it's above his 
head.

1829
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,553
Well,
whenever you asked somebody what does 

1830
01:23:37,201 --> 01:23:39,780
that,
when you lost someone like Randy Moss.

1831
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,700
Oh,
but wearing muscle went out for football

1832
01:23:41,701 --> 01:23:44,760
and his chest is out.
Your like at your head level.

1833
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,290
That's what someone looks like.
But there's other words for it.

1834
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:50,124
So you might reach someone.
I can't believe you're doing this 

1835
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:54,840
without your,
your sensor on because you're so serious

1836
01:23:54,841 --> 01:23:55,750
about it.
Somebody.

1837
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,530
Yeah.
You're losing so many points.

1838
01:23:58,890 --> 01:23:59,723
Wow.
Do you do any strength and conditioning 

1839
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:02,700
to prepare for this?
Yeah.

1840
01:24:02,701 --> 01:24:06,300
So the season is a couple of months 
long.

1841
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:09,330
So yes I am.
We're in the off season now.

1842
01:24:09,331 --> 01:24:12,720
This season just ended,
so we're just basically rebuilding.

1843
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:15,720
I lose 15 pounds during the season,
so I'm putting that up

1844
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:16,573
back on.
Then you get to like try out season in 

1845
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:21,270
like February or March.
Uh,

1846
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,080
and then you just start.
Yeah,

1847
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,730
getting a throws back,
getting your cardio back and starting to

1848
01:24:25,731 --> 01:24:27,230
work into it.
And then the season starts.

1849
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,040
I would think that like leg strength and
explosive power,

1850
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:33,950
like doing box jumps and things along 
those lines would be huge for you.

1851
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:34,680
Yes.

1852
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,540
Uh,
so there's different,

1853
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:39,900
like sort of like basketball or 
football.

1854
01:24:39,901 --> 01:24:41,820
There's different sort of types of 
players.

1855
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:44,320
Uh,
you can sort of diff.

1856
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,220
There's so many things to explain with 
Frisbee.

1857
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,530
There's a throwers and catchers you 
might call them,

1858
01:24:49,531 --> 01:24:52,860
so handlers and receivers a lot of 
shorter,

1859
01:24:52,861 --> 01:24:53,694
faster.
People who aren't as explosive but are 

1860
01:24:55,501 --> 01:24:56,430
really,
really quick.

1861
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:57,463
Our,
our handlers now go around the squirrel 

1862
01:24:58,951 --> 01:24:59,784
around and they'll have awesome strength
and they'll be able to throw it 

1863
01:25:02,491 --> 01:25:03,324
anywhere,
but they won't necessarily go downfield 

1864
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:08,860
and try to go score on someone because 
they're not as tall or as explosive.

1865
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,690
Meanwhile,
a lot of cutters are receivers are.

1866
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,850
You can think of sort of like a wide 
receiver in football,

1867
01:25:14,851 --> 01:25:15,684
they're going down field in there,
the athletes going and making plays in 

1868
01:25:18,451 --> 01:25:20,760
the air and they're hard to guard down 
field,

1869
01:25:20,761 --> 01:25:23,160
but they're not necessarily scrolling 
around throwing a lot.

1870
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,023
They're mostly just catching,
dumping it off to another thrower and 

1871
01:25:26,161 --> 01:25:30,030
then going for some more yards again.
So if you watch a game unfold,

1872
01:25:30,031 --> 01:25:30,864
it's very fluid.
You constantly switched between offense 

1873
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:34,380
and defense,
like basketball,

1874
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,333
you're scoring and an end zone and then 
the points over and then you pull again 

1875
01:25:37,771 --> 01:25:40,560
to start.
But as the points going on,

1876
01:25:40,561 --> 01:25:44,700
you kind of notice like certain players 
are mostly doing certain things,

1877
01:25:44,701 --> 01:25:47,040
like mostly throwing,
mostly getting the disc back.

1878
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:50,400
Other people are mostly going downfield,
threatening deep.

1879
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,640
There's a lot of terminology you get 
involved in this.

1880
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,350
Uh,
the high school I went to,

1881
01:25:55,351 --> 01:25:58,260
Columbia high school invented this sport
in 1968.

1882
01:25:59,080 --> 01:25:59,913
Had a very competitive team for the 
years that I was there and I made a lot 

1883
01:26:01,951 --> 01:26:02,784
of friends on the team playing.
I played for the JV team for the first 

1884
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:09,200
two years and then I played for the 
Varsity team my second two years,

1885
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,100
so it was pretty serious program and we 
played against other high schools around

1886
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:13,640
the country.

1887
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,640
We traveled,
we flew play against.

1888
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:21,650
We had rivals in Massachusetts and 
Connecticut and all these other schools,

1889
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:22,873
and then we had the big eastern 
championship at the end of the high 

1890
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:26,420
school season.
That was,

1891
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:27,253
that's what we all played for it.
We won 11 straight state championships 

1892
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,560
the two years that I played.
That's incredible.

1893
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,540
Yeah.
I did not know that.

1894
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:38,450
This was even a thing.
They dealt as a rich history to it.

1895
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:39,740
Yeah,
the tea.

1896
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:41,390
Yeah.
50th anniversary this year.

1897
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:43,640
That is so crazy.
I would've never guessed.

1898
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:45,480
You said one was ultimate frisbee 
invented.

1899
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,590
I would say like a couple months ago.
Yeah.

1900
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:51,230
Well it's so the pro league just is less
than 10 years old,

1901
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,210
so there's always been this sort of 
club.

1902
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:54,160
You think of clubs,
soccer,

1903
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:56,000
like area teams.
There's always been that.

1904
01:26:56,001 --> 01:26:56,834
So I've played for the New Jersey Garden
State Club team for much longer than I 

1905
01:27:00,321 --> 01:27:01,154
played for any proteins and that's 
generally what players take the most 

1906
01:27:04,101 --> 01:27:04,730
seriously.

1907
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:07,160
The club championships were this past 
weekend,

1908
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:12,110
the New York area team beat the San 
Francisco area team to win nationals.

1909
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,930
Like that's generally what people care 
the most about,

1910
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:20,560
but it's not very spectator friendly.
So what we've sort of created is the Adl

1911
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:27,050
is the American ultimate disc league.
It's a pro version of Frisbee.

1912
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:29,570
It's mainly the same sport but a little 
bigger field,

1913
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:30,783
uh,
and a little bit faster play just 

1914
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:34,124
because they've shortened the stoppages 
and they have referees and everything 

1915
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:36,794
now and there is selling tickets and 
selling merchant and jerseys and like 

1916
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:44,720
broadcasting games and they have a pro 
championship at the end of the year.

1917
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:46,063
So that's,
that's been like a whole new thing for 

1918
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:50,690
frisbee players to pay attention to.
And I've,

1919
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:51,853
I've played for a protein as well as 
past couple years and it's been pretty 

1920
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,150
fun.
Well I bought it because,

1921
01:27:56,151 --> 01:27:58,070
I mean just watching that clip was 
really exciting.

1922
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,650
Yeah,
it looks fun and you guys aren't getting

1923
01:28:00,651 --> 01:28:03,140
any brain damage.
That's a big deal.

1924
01:28:03,141 --> 01:28:05,870
It's about the same level of contact is 
basketball I would say.

1925
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:06,853
Perfect.
So you're not like throwing elbows or 

1926
01:28:08,361 --> 01:28:10,760
anything like that.
There are false so you got to be careful

1927
01:28:10,761 --> 01:28:11,900
about where you're throwing your body 
around,

1928
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:14,480
but you're not going to happen because 
people are running at each other,

1929
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:15,260
but.
Exactly.

1930
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,320
You're not worried about tackles.
Everything.

1931
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:19,910
Stopped football or Lacrosse,
which I tried Lacrosse.

1932
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:20,744
That was not for me.
Ridiculous people hitting each other 

1933
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:23,564
with sticks.
Yeah,

1934
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:24,890
fuck all that.
It was a lot.

1935
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:29,270
Do you mess around with Vr at all?
Yes,

1936
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,530
a little bit.
I have A.

1937
01:28:30,531 --> 01:28:34,700
I have an htc vive and that's been the 
most common use of Vr.

1938
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:35,534
We have a vibe in the studio and the two
games that come to mind the most are 

1939
01:28:38,211 --> 01:28:39,770
called super hot.

1940
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:41,510
Don't know if you've played that.
No.

1941
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,870
And beat Saber.
I try to play,

1942
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:48,320
but my kids dominate this.
The vr thing.

1943
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,173
Yeah,
they come in here and like get outta 

1944
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:52,000
here.
They pushed me away and there's a lot of

1945
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,780
those.
There's a lot of fun stuff,

1946
01:28:53,781 --> 01:28:56,480
so I like so,
so super high is a fun one.

1947
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:59,420
It's a shooting game,
strategy game type of thing.

1948
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:00,770
Um,
so,

1949
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,583
so the way supra you're getting,
you're in Vr so you're wearing this 

1950
01:29:04,681 --> 01:29:05,514
thing and it's a bunch of stick figures 
trying to kill you and they're running 

1951
01:29:08,461 --> 01:29:10,220
downstairs,
running around corners,

1952
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:12,210
shooting at you,
trying to kill you,

1953
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:17,240
but time only moves when you move.
So if you hold still you can look around

1954
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:18,534
and like see in the headset where people
are and sort of evaluate like okay I 

1955
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:22,404
can,
I can pick up this object and hurt 

1956
01:29:23,341 --> 01:29:24,174
somebody with it.

1957
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,350
This is it right here.
Yeah.

1958
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:27,570
This is very crude looking video.
Yeah,

1959
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:29,580
it's super basic.
Again,

1960
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:30,414
stick figures trying to kill you,
but it's like a strategy game in that 

1961
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:34,823
you sort of have to evaluate where 
you're at and not look around too much 

1962
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,550
and then as soon as you start to move 
and throw things,

1963
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,170
everyone else is trying to kill you 
also.

1964
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:44,263
Huh?
And so you can sort of dodge bullets as 

1965
01:29:45,991 --> 01:29:46,824
they come around because you don't move 
when you see them flying through the 

1966
01:29:49,711 --> 01:29:50,544
air.
There's a lot of cool stuff to this 

1967
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:53,520
game.
So I got really into it.

1968
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,770
I didn't get to this level,
which is probably.

1969
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:56,604
Yeah,
you got to dodge all the bullets flying 

1970
01:29:57,961 --> 01:29:58,810
at you.
Turn around,

1971
01:29:58,830 --> 01:29:59,700
throw something at him.

1972
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:03,270
There's a boxing game.
Well there's several boxing games,

1973
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:06,720
but in vr that are really good.
Wow.

1974
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:07,613
And there they give you a workout 
because there's a guy in front of you 

1975
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:11,604
and he's throwing punches and you're 
bobbing and weaving like full speed 

1976
01:30:13,771 --> 01:30:15,060
punching at him.
Yeah.

1977
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,330
Yeah.
And they look good like it looks like,

1978
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:19,183
like,
like you're in the ring and the guy's 

1979
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:23,190
looking at Jews mean mugging in throws 
punches your way.

1980
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:25,320
And when you get hit you see a flash of 
white.

1981
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,650
I want to try that now.
Yeah,

1982
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:30,570
it's really fun.
But I think with the,

1983
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:31,673
with the haptic feedback suit,
especially if you could put something 

1984
01:30:33,781 --> 01:30:34,860
there it is right here,
the new one.

1985
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:35,694
This is.
Oh this is a new one to create video 

1986
01:30:36,361 --> 01:30:37,160
casts.
On your mouth.

1987
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,510
Oh,
rock new rocky movie.

1988
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:40,710
Or they can block.
Yeah,

1989
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:44,650
follow up damaging kind of expose 
protocol.

1990
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:48,120
You could hear rocky's,
you're chairing this look at this,

1991
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:52,980
but when you're doing it,
like we did it out here in the hallway.

1992
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:53,843
My feet were hurting because I was 
moving and shifting left and right and 

1993
01:30:57,721 --> 01:31:01,710
throwing punches and bouncing off my 
toes and after it was over to my fucking

1994
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:02,544
feet are exhausted and you're doing the 
drills and everything more so than it 

1995
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:09,540
would be if I was actually sparring.
Huh?

1996
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,640
Because it was actually sparring.
I don't think I would.

1997
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:15,270
I don't think it would throw as many 
punches in such a quick succession.

1998
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:20,220
You'd be more worried about getting hit 
back and actually getting punched,

1999
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:22,440
but when you're doing.
It's really interesting.

2000
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:23,910
Wow.
Yeah,

2001
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:27,300
that's I got to know,
is that Adrian?

2002
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:33,050
There's also the uh,
is this the eight htc vive to it says,

2003
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,290
yeah,
this just came out for all of them.

2004
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:35,253
Okay.
Yeah.

2005
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,270
Yeah.
The other one,

2006
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:39,300
the other one's called beat Saber and 
it's a.

2007
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:42,720
You can think of it as like guitar hero,
but you're holding a light saber.

2008
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:44,960
My kids love that.
I've gone past you.

2009
01:31:44,961 --> 01:31:45,794
I love that.
And things are flying at you and you're 

2010
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:47,714
hitting them.
Yeah.

2011
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,700
That,
that is a really well done.

2012
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,390
Yeah.
There's a bunch of really well done once

2013
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,233
there's a,
there's a great one that you're in a 

2014
01:31:54,261 --> 01:31:55,094
castle and you have a,
like an old school bone Arrow and then 

2015
01:31:58,070 --> 01:32:00,340
disease almost like South Park.

2016
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:02,630
Look at monsters.
Yeah.

2017
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,960
And they're like,
it's still kind of cartoony.

2018
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:07,470
But like if the graphics are crisp 
enough that you like,

2019
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:09,550
feel like you're a cartoon character in 
a way.

2020
01:32:09,551 --> 01:32:10,550
Yeah,
it's good.

2021
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,460
Yeah,
it's really cool.

2022
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:13,303
And you know,
like there's actual physics to the 

2023
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:15,874
Arrow,
like when you shoot it certainly like 

2024
01:32:17,321 --> 01:32:19,780
you have to lift your arm up to get the 
arc of the Arrow.

2025
01:32:19,781 --> 01:32:21,160
Correct.
A hit it things.

2026
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:22,210
Yeah.
Yeah,

2027
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:22,860
yeah.
That's good.

2028
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,050
I so I,
I think about vr a lot just because as a

2029
01:32:26,051 --> 01:32:26,884
video maker you're making content for 
the platform that people view it on and 

2030
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:33,004
we started to get this little creeping 
up of like three 60 video is getting 

2031
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:36,634
really good and like interesting 
applications of of three 60 video and 

2032
01:32:41,111 --> 01:32:41,944
it's still kind of early and I don't 
really know if it's gonna take off or 

2033
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:45,154
it's,
it was just this medium steppingstone 

2034
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,093
format to what might be a more immersive
thing or maybe just ar is going to be 

2035
01:32:52,271 --> 01:32:52,780
way better.

2036
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,613
I don't know yet,
but I pay a lot of attention to it just 

2037
01:32:56,141 --> 01:32:57,670
because it's,
it's new.

2038
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,600
Ar is fascinating as well.
I mean we,

2039
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:02,401
we,
we discussed,

2040
01:33:02,401 --> 01:33:04,330
what was it,
magic leap.

2041
01:33:04,331 --> 01:33:05,164
Is that what it was?
The Microsoft one know that that's the 

2042
01:33:07,001 --> 01:33:07,834
other one.
Hollow Lens is Microsoft and then 

2043
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,920
magically it does its own thing.
I haven't tried either actually yet.

2044
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:15,250
And which one was the one where the 
Ballerina was dancing in your hand?

2045
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,910
Magic leap,
but which one is that?

2046
01:33:18,911 --> 01:33:20,800
The one that people are saying is kind 
of vaporware,

2047
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,640
sort of,
sort of.

2048
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:24,903
I would imagine that that screen on that
phone would have some sort of similar 

2049
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:31,930
technologies like light field 
technology.

2050
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,630
Talk about that.
Doing weird stuff with your eyes.

2051
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:37,240
This is weird.
So this phone has a,

2052
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:38,703
what are they calling it?
I'm not going to remember what they're 

2053
01:33:43,491 --> 01:33:44,100
calling it.
Oh,

2054
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:45,870
is there?
I need Wifi for it actually.

2055
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:47,603
Uh,
it's got a three d screen at glasses 

2056
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:50,483
list.
3D,

2057
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:53,780
uh,
and you,

2058
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,180
you basically,
it has a three d screening.

2059
01:33:56,181 --> 01:34:01,181
You look at media on it and it's 
supposed to sort of pop out at the top.

2060
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:06,860
That doesn't have to be lowercase a 
lowercase.

2061
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:07,420
No,
no,

2062
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:08,390
it doesn't.
One is it,

2063
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12,160
this is um,
t ballon.

2064
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,313
Yeah.
Yeah,

2065
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,590
that's it.
Uh,

2066
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:17,090
but basically it's about,
it can look like that,

2067
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:22,150
but you can't have things actually 
popping out above the screen.

2068
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,560
So things on the screen will look three 
d,

2069
01:34:24,561 --> 01:34:26,750
but anything like outside of the screen 
won't.

2070
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:28,450
It's kind of hard to explain.
Wow.

2071
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:32,900
And so this is for video games or for 
other things as well.

2072
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:33,763
So at this point what they're trying to 
do is have a media like photos and 

2073
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,760
videos pop out,
pop out,

2074
01:34:40,761 --> 01:34:43,160
so not just games,
they're going to have games as well,

2075
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,473
but they have shared with me a couple of
media files that are like a good use of 

2076
01:34:50,091 --> 01:34:53,480
the three d and I'm curious what you 
think of them because they're definitely

2077
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:58,670
like a stretch but it's hollow me 
Holler,

2078
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:02,030
holographic is the word they use but 
it's,

2079
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,580
it's hard to explain and it's kind of 
trippy,

2080
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,033
oh

2081
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,430
do this is weird.

2082
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,360
And there's,
there's different like,

2083
01:35:12,361 --> 01:35:15,720
so there's a movie trailer version of it
where there's like things coming towards

2084
01:35:15,721 --> 01:35:17,820
you and I think that's maybe the best 
use of it.

2085
01:35:17,821 --> 01:35:18,654
I've seen

2086
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:22,850
it's impossible to show on camera.
I've tried many different times this,

2087
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:26,110
this will never show up on camera.
This is odd.

2088
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:27,453
Yeah,
they're an issue or like people have to 

2089
01:35:30,281 --> 01:35:32,680
make stuff for this.
So.

2090
01:35:32,681 --> 01:35:36,040
So any content you have to shoot for,
for view,

2091
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,060
they call it four of you

2092
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:42,540
or they can take existing content and 
convert it to four view,

2093
01:35:42,581 --> 01:35:45,070
but that's a little less successful 
usually.

2094
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:49,780
So it's really strange,
but the cameras on the back,

2095
01:35:49,781 --> 01:35:50,614
they have two cameras on the back and 
you can shoot for a view with the 

2096
01:35:52,901 --> 01:35:55,270
cameras on the hydrogen.
It's crazy.

2097
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:55,760
Well,
what,

2098
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,593
what,
what I'm looking at right now is a 

2099
01:35:57,910 --> 01:36:00,700
topographic maps.
Yeah.

2100
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,480
Wow.
Amazing man.

2101
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:05,580
So there's,
it's,

2102
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:06,350
it's hard to

2103
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:07,183
tell again,
like I try to separate things into 

2104
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:09,873
buckets of this is something you're 
going to use everyday and love or this 

2105
01:36:12,791 --> 01:36:14,470
is a total gimmick that you'll never use
again.

2106
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:15,903
And I met,
I started with it in the bucket of this 

2107
01:36:17,891 --> 01:36:18,724
is kind of like a gimmick,
but they've put so much effort into 

2108
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:26,930
making it good and all these different 
conversion techniques in.

2109
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:33,730
Let me see if I can find a clip,
but they've been constantly changing the

2110
01:36:33,731 --> 01:36:34,564
algorithms and adjusting it and updating
it to look better that it's starting to 

2111
01:36:39,011 --> 01:36:39,844
convince me that it might be worth 
paying attention to for more than just 

2112
01:36:42,611 --> 01:36:47,611
the first two seconds.
This is amazing.

2113
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:52,660
Do you think you would like use it all 
the time?

2114
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:53,623
No,
never use it.

2115
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:56,390
It's still amazing.
It's still pretty cool.

2116
01:36:56,391 --> 01:36:58,730
Right?
It's very cool.

2117
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:03,320
But how much better is it than regular 
video that,

2118
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:04,183
that end?
How long can you like look at it before 

2119
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:07,330
your eyes start to tweak?
A little bit.

2120
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,540
Um,
I'm already going,

2121
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,990
but it looks good.
It definitely looks really good.

2122
01:37:11,991 --> 01:37:13,610
It looks cool.
It's kind of interesting.

2123
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:14,493
Yeah.
But

2124
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,793
so you can take,
you can take photos and videos with the 

2125
01:37:18,901 --> 01:37:23,400
camera on the phone that are in this 
three d and that's maybe the best use of

2126
01:37:23,401 --> 01:37:25,950
it because then you can see like what's 
actually in the room around you.

2127
01:37:25,951 --> 01:37:28,290
The way it would just show up and like a
direct translation.

2128
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:30,183
Yeah.
How much of an impact does it have on 

2129
01:37:31,061 --> 01:37:33,090
storage size?
Uh,

2130
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,113
not much.

2131
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:37,640
I mean there's still video files and 
they're like big four k videos,

2132
01:37:37,641 --> 01:37:41,540
but they're not necessarily through 
faces big or anything like that.

2133
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:45,500
It looks cool but,
but then use the video looks pretty cool

2134
01:37:45,501 --> 01:37:47,120
too.
When you go into the view finder and you

2135
01:37:47,121 --> 01:37:47,954
go from two d to three d,
then he can take photos and videos of 

2136
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:53,023
things

2137
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,040
in that format.
So he,

2138
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,010
oh this

2139
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,070
is weird man.
Take.

2140
01:37:58,410 --> 01:37:59,243
If you take a capture and then look at 
it and you kind of like move the phone 

2141
01:38:02,011 --> 01:38:05,160
around a little bit.
It's Kinda like Shimmery in a weird way,

2142
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:09,750
but kind of three d sort of.
This is very odd.

2143
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,400
It's very hard to explain.
Yeah.

2144
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:13,860
You'd have to look at this through this 
thing.

2145
01:38:13,861 --> 01:38:15,960
Like you'd would never be able to show 
this to someone in a video.

2146
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:16,863
Yeah,
exactly.

2147
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:20,100
Look,
I'm looking at these plastic sell little

2148
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,520
figurines and as I move forward and 
backward,

2149
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:26,160
you really get a sense of three d.
yeah,

2150
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:27,383
that's pretty bad ass.
So I gotta figure out how to show it in 

2151
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:31,740
the video of like,
you can't.

2152
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:34,470
I just have to describe it to use my 
words.

2153
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,760
God,
that's amazing.

2154
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,470
Yeah.
And that's.

2155
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,590
Well,
it's probably coming.

2156
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:39,753
That's probably common.
It's probably going to be something 

2157
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:41,580
we're all gonna have to deal with.

2158
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,870
Yeah.
I'm interested.

2159
01:38:43,070 --> 01:38:44,760
Uh,
if you ask,

2160
01:38:44,761 --> 01:38:45,520
read that tell you,
yeah,

2161
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,570
this is the future.
Everything's going to be like this.

2162
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:48,870
I'm like,
you got it.

2163
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:52,110
I think you have to say that at this 
three d movies were a big deal.

2164
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,920
Get those stupid glasses and yeah,
I mean,

2165
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:56,220
so they're claiming is like,
yes,

2166
01:38:56,221 --> 01:38:57,054
this is what's it's genuinely good.
Like you can use it in portrait and 

2167
01:39:00,061 --> 01:39:01,680
landscape glasses.
Let's three d,

2168
01:39:01,681 --> 01:39:04,800
it's usually only one way or the other 
because of polarization.

2169
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:09,390
So this is a lenticular technology.
I don't know exactly how it works,

2170
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:11,520
but you can use it in portrait or 
landscape.

2171
01:39:11,521 --> 01:39:16,170
You can play games with it and things 
will react in depth of space on,

2172
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,400
in the game.
Well,

2173
01:39:17,401 --> 01:39:19,110
the first video that you showed me is 
really interesting too,

2174
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:21,570
because it's essentially like a 
topographic map.

2175
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:23,340
Yeah.
So it's like Sarah,

2176
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:24,840
you're paying attention to depth.

2177
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,713
Yeah.
You're looking at the layers of the 

2178
01:39:27,181 --> 01:39:32,181
mountain and the hillside.
So it was kind of weirder,

2179
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:36,630
like seeing these little figurines and 
moving toward them in real life.

2180
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:37,370
Yeah,
yeah,

2181
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:39,780
yeah.
That's what I think is a,

2182
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,980
that's the best way to calibrate tier.
I like what it's doing around,

2183
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,580
if you just look at like a video of it,
you're like,

2184
01:39:44,581 --> 01:39:46,860
all right,
it looks three d like it's coming at me.

2185
01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:48,930
And they had a couple,
uh,

2186
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,570
like a movie trailer type of thing where
like again,

2187
01:39:51,571 --> 01:39:52,404
like it was mostly shot for this format 
and things would like kind of go past 

2188
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:59,010
you and the speakers are also really 
good.

2189
01:39:59,011 --> 01:39:59,844
So they have this sort of a three d 
conversion technique for audio as well 

2190
01:40:02,761 --> 01:40:06,300
where it sort of goes behind you.
But yeah,

2191
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:08,760
it's definitely interesting.
Yeah.

2192
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:09,594
Um,
did you mess around with Google glasses 

2193
01:40:11,431 --> 01:40:12,390
when they first came out?

2194
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:13,260
It did,
yeah.

2195
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,760
What did you think?
Okay,

2196
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:15,594
this is,
this is going to be something I guess I 

2197
01:40:18,391 --> 01:40:19,920
probably did.
I,

2198
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:20,993
it was a glass was weird.
It was ahead of its time but also like 

2199
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,450
not really.
Like I,

2200
01:40:26,451 --> 01:40:27,570
I,
I had it,

2201
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:28,493
I was in college also,
so it was like I can't wear it to class 

2202
01:40:30,271 --> 01:40:33,180
or like walk around.
I guess I could walk around hoboken with

2203
01:40:33,181 --> 01:40:34,014
it,
but the whole idea of an augmented 

2204
01:40:35,191 --> 01:40:36,024
reality,
this little screen that I could just 

2205
01:40:37,651 --> 01:40:38,484
check the weather and then look back 
down or check my texts and look back 

2206
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:42,170
down and was like,
oh,

2207
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,013
that could be cool.
But also if you look at someone wearing 

2208
01:40:45,301 --> 01:40:46,110
google glass,
it's like,

2209
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:48,120
that guy's wearing google glass,
you can't,

2210
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:48,993
can't get around it where people would 
get angry at people for wearing it 

2211
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:52,560
because it had a camera and filming me.

2212
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,393
What are you doing?
Yeah.

2213
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:55,570
Yeah.
So that was another thing is I tried,

2214
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,370
uh,
I won't even say the name,

2215
01:40:57,371 --> 01:40:58,204
but like another,
like much newer version of that where 

2216
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:01,160
again,
it was like a,

2217
01:41:01,470 --> 01:41:03,530
a small projection to a prism that 
would,

2218
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,473
you could see,
but no one else could and it would fit 

2219
01:41:06,371 --> 01:41:08,860
into something that looked more like 
regular glasses.

2220
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,233
So it had a battery,
it had everything but it didn't have a 

2221
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:14,680
camera and you still had a screen that 
you could look up into the corner too.

2222
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:16,061
And I was like,
well,

2223
01:41:16,061 --> 01:41:18,610
I wonder if you'll notice the difference
between regular glasses.

2224
01:41:18,611 --> 01:41:19,444
And I went down and I met the guys who 
were showing it to me in the lobby and 

2225
01:41:22,151 --> 01:41:23,710
immediately I was like,
that guy's wearing it.

2226
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,320
I can see it.
I could see a little light in his eye.

2227
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:28,480
I can see like the extra thick glasses.

2228
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,460
So it was like,
it's,

2229
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,353
it's an interesting concept and I don't 
know where it goes from here if it has 

2230
01:41:36,611 --> 01:41:37,444
to be glasses based or if we'll 
eventually have some sort of a chip in 

2231
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:43,900
her eye or what the deal is,
what the next move is.

2232
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:46,360
But it's a cool concept.
Yeah.

2233
01:41:46,361 --> 01:41:47,194
It's one of those things that sort of,
it's kind of been flirting with for the 

2234
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:54,400
longest time people thought virtual 
reality was going to be.

2235
01:41:55,590 --> 01:42:00,590
I mean there was virtual reality 
concepts 20 years ago and people thought

2236
01:42:00,611 --> 01:42:02,880
virtual reality was going to be the 
future and then it,

2237
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:06,100
it took a long time for the hardware to 
catch up.

2238
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:07,263
I think augmented reality has a more 
promising immediate future just because 

2239
01:42:10,031 --> 01:42:12,160
it's more useful.
Um,

2240
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:16,750
but virtual reality has like the 
immersion factor going for it.

2241
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,380
The problem is you have to make a whole,
you have to make a whole world.

2242
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:24,970
So augmented reality is just like some 
layer on top of your current world.

2243
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:27,340
So you get like a little screen or 
whatever,

2244
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:31,000
or you look at one particular thing and 
it looks different from real life.

2245
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:33,820
That's easier to build for virtual 
reality,

2246
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:37,930
you have to build the whole world that 
you step into it.

2247
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:42,910
That's like a much,
much a deeper layer of immersion,

2248
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:45,340
which is great to step into but also 
hard to make.

2249
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,570
So that's the difference.
I think I'm more into ar at the moment.

2250
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:54,490
Well I think ar in the sense of having 
all the functions of your phone in front

2251
01:42:54,491 --> 01:42:56,770
of you in the air when you call upon 
them.

2252
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,210
Yeah.
Kind of like a movie.

2253
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:59,230
Yeah.
Like a,

2254
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:02,050
like one,
someone in a movie or like iron man even

2255
01:43:02,051 --> 01:43:02,884
like they just out like as a sheet of 
like buttons in front of them and like 

2256
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:08,830
close it only they could see that maybe 
that's the future and have some,

2257
01:43:08,831 --> 01:43:11,380
Hey Siri type,
you know,

2258
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,470
hopefully not demand series.

2259
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,560
Terrible.
Serious.

2260
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:16,870
Not that good.
It works for some things.

2261
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:20,290
It's okay if something.
Siri Google assistants better though.

2262
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:21,400
Yes.
Yeah.

2263
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:23,430
Uh,
yeah.

2264
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:25,010
See that?
Well there's the.

2265
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:27,940
Have you tried bixby thing?
Excuse even worse.

2266
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:29,590
Bixby.
It was pretty bad.

2267
01:43:29,710 --> 01:43:31,720
Yeah.
But bixby does a few things.

2268
01:43:31,721 --> 01:43:32,551
Okay.
Like a checks.

2269
01:43:32,551 --> 01:43:33,460
Flights.
Okay.

2270
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:34,453
Me has like bixby.
I think is hilarious because it shows 

2271
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:39,370
how good it can be and then it isn't 
good like it.

2272
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:40,263
It has a couple of things that it can 
definitely do better than any other 

2273
01:43:43,841 --> 01:43:44,674
assistant,
like what it can dig in locally on 

2274
01:43:46,961 --> 01:43:49,810
Samsung phones and like do strings of 
commands.

2275
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:50,883
You can say,
Hey,

2276
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,730
Spi,
open my settings APP,

2277
01:43:52,731 --> 01:43:57,020
turn my brightness halfway down and turn
my wifi off and it'll do all of that.

2278
01:43:57,860 --> 01:43:59,600
And Siri and Google assistant won't do 
that.

2279
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:00,741
But if you say,
hey,

2280
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:03,740
big speed,
how tall is like the Statue of Liberty?

2281
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:07,910
It might not do it like it's a really 
bad at a lot of basic things.

2282
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:09,343
So yeah,
Google Assistant I think is the most 

2283
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:13,430
complete and useful.
I genuinely use it all the time.

2284
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:14,473
Syria mostly triggered by accident and 
then I wonder if it's better and it 

2285
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:20,510
isn't what's offensive.
The bixby has a button.

2286
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:21,850
Yeah,
I hate that.

2287
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:22,670
Come on.
Why?

2288
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:23,503
And you can remap an unreal mappable 
Dick speed button that you accidentally 

2289
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:29,220
press all the time.
Yeah,

2290
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,570
lower left hand corner.
Like what is this thing that.

2291
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:32,840
It's pretty bad.
Yeah.

2292
01:44:32,841 --> 01:44:35,450
The iphone Siri button gets pressed a 
lot,

2293
01:44:35,451 --> 01:44:38,090
but what I really like about the pixels 
of squeeze.

2294
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:39,380
Yeah,
you can turn it off.

2295
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,400
Do you use it,
like just squeeze it?

2296
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:42,740
Actually the assistant?
Yeah.

2297
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:43,583
Once in a while.
I mostly use the hey google trigger 

2298
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:48,470
which is mapped to my voice,
so see it turns on now that I said it.

2299
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:51,140
Oh Wow.
But I started using the squeeze a little

2300
01:44:51,141 --> 01:44:51,974
more so I don't have to yell and I can 
just squeeze it and say a commander 

2301
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:57,110
question.
Mostly question now,

2302
01:44:57,111 --> 01:44:57,944
do you use any of the home feature 
things like do you use Alexa or the 

2303
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:03,403
Google home or.
A first thing I got into my home was 

2304
01:45:05,571 --> 01:45:07,850
google home,
so now I have a google home home.

2305
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:12,050
If I had Alexa first thing I probably 
would have had an Alexa home with things

2306
01:45:12,051 --> 01:45:12,884
that worked with Alexa,
but they genuinely like usually work 

2307
01:45:14,661 --> 01:45:15,920
with each other.
Do your lights,

2308
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:16,783
work with it.
And also what I have is I have a nest 

2309
01:45:18,921 --> 01:45:23,921
thermostat and I have a nest security 
camera and I think that's it.

2310
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,023
And I had smart lights but I stopped 
using them so it's mostly just the nest 

2311
01:45:28,371 --> 01:45:33,371
stuff and I can ask what the temperature
is upstairs and then say hey,

2312
01:45:33,771 --> 01:45:35,540
change the temperature to this and then 
it'll do it.

2313
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,620
So I don't have to run out and find the 
thermostat and change it myself.

2314
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,990
I remember hearing that,
um,

2315
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:43,063
Bill Gates had some pin that you would 
put on when you entered into his home 

2316
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:51,170
and when you go into certain rooms,
if you had a pin on it would recognize,

2317
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,033
oh it's bill.
Bill likes the temperature at this 

2318
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:56,360
level.
He likes this art on the wall.

2319
01:45:56,361 --> 01:46:00,350
So he had have lcd screens that would 
display different images.

2320
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:03,050
That's almost too much modularity.
Like I,

2321
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:07,070
I kinda,
I like it a general state of like things

2322
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:08,870
are the same unless I want them to 
change.

2323
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:10,023
Like that would be kind of weird.
Like every time you leave the room the 

2324
01:46:11,421 --> 01:46:12,254
art changes behind you when you walked 
back in and it changes back and you 

2325
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:16,220
leave again.
It's kind of a lot.

2326
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,780
Uh,
but yeah,

2327
01:46:17,781 --> 01:46:18,614
like just like a couple things,
like I have the Google home app where 

2328
01:46:21,291 --> 01:46:22,190
I'll like,
yeah,

2329
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:26,210
changes the temperature once in awhile 
or a you get,

2330
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:28,820
there's this thing I've considered 
getting the ring doorbell.

2331
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:30,410
Yeah.
Which has a camera,

2332
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:32,210
but I don't really use the doorbell that
much.

2333
01:46:32,211 --> 01:46:34,320
It's mostly packages get delivered to 
work instead of home.

2334
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:36,553
Yeah,
that's about it.

2335
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:39,980
Yeah.
The Alexa and the Google home,

2336
01:46:39,981 --> 01:46:42,010
they're like,
what the big concern that people have is

2337
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:42,853
it's listening to you all the time.
Like there was a store that I read 

2338
01:46:45,291 --> 01:46:46,124
about,
there was a murder investigation and 

2339
01:46:47,931 --> 01:46:52,630
that they were trying to get the records
of Amazon Alexa Wild,

2340
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:53,603
you know,
this murder investigation was going on 

2341
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:55,914
because they think they could have like 
listened to the conversation and then 

2342
01:46:58,351 --> 01:46:59,310
people are like,
wait a minute,

2343
01:46:59,530 --> 01:47:01,860
this fucking thing.
Just listening all the time.

2344
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:03,900
Well it is,
but it's not,

2345
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:06,570
don't worry about it.
It'll help you.

2346
01:47:06,571 --> 01:47:08,430
Yeah.
If you get murdered dee,

2347
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:09,900
you don't want anybody to get away with 
it.

2348
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:10,950
Do you?
True.

2349
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,320
Yeah,
that is a lot.

2350
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:15,300
Yet it's got to listen like.

2351
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:19,380
So the whole privacy thing,
I have honestly have to think about that

2352
01:47:19,381 --> 01:47:20,430
a lot.
Mike.

2353
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:25,460
My compromise in my own head personally 
is I don't have privacy and I know it so

2354
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,070
I might as well get something back for 
it,

2355
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,760
which is convenience.
So like if,

2356
01:47:31,810 --> 01:47:34,560
if I'm going to have like this Google 
assistant on my phone,

2357
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,420
I already have a gps and Wifi and all 
these sensors in my phone,

2358
01:47:38,430 --> 01:47:39,263
I might as well like Google of course 
they know where I am so I might as well 

2359
01:47:41,941 --> 01:47:44,940
get something for it.
So maybe I'll get like shortcuts to like

2360
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:46,290
where I need to go,
you know,

2361
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:49,080
where my work is just gimme a shortcut 
to traffic to work.

2362
01:47:49,081 --> 01:47:51,430
Like that's what's weird and says you'll
be home in 12 minutes.

2363
01:47:51,431 --> 01:47:52,470
Like pitch.
How do you know where I lived?

2364
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:53,490
Yeah,
exactly.

2365
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:54,780
How do you know when I'm home?

2366
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:55,613
But if you're going to know that,
which I know you are because you're 

2367
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:58,950
google,
then give me something back.

2368
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:00,390
Right.
And you know,

2369
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:03,030
restaurants near me.
Like how do you know where I am?

2370
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:06,450
You're watching me all the time.
You're constantly basically.

2371
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:10,950
So it knows like I have a couple of like
preferences that seem like pretty minor,

2372
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:11,784
like what sports teams do you like?
What sports do you enjoy watching or 

2373
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:14,964
like what sort of topics do you enjoy?
And if you open my google assistant it 

2374
01:48:17,551 --> 01:48:18,384
will tell you like here's the score of 
the game you were about to check the 

2375
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:23,670
score to here's the traffic.
I have a flight later.

2376
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:24,803
What is going to do and I know it's 
going to do this is it's going to tell 

2377
01:48:26,761 --> 01:48:29,130
me when it's time to leave based on 
traffic,

2378
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:30,023
based on my location to arrive to my 
flight 90 minutes before the scheduled 

2379
01:48:33,811 --> 01:48:34,644
departure.

2380
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:37,770
It's going to tell me when to leave 
because it knows where I am.

2381
01:48:37,771 --> 01:48:40,290
It knows where the airport I'm leaving 
from is it knows my flight,

2382
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:41,543
my flight time and it knows I need to 
get to the airport in 90 minutes before 

2383
01:48:44,281 --> 01:48:46,500
the flight.
Does Google own ways now?

2384
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:49,830
Uh,
they either own ways or bought.

2385
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:51,750
I think that yeah,
I think they bought waste.

2386
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,480
So when you get something through Google
maps,

2387
01:48:54,481 --> 01:48:56,700
it does kind of the same thing that 
weighs does,

2388
01:48:56,701 --> 01:48:57,370
right?
Yeah,

2389
01:48:57,370 --> 01:48:57,871
yeah,
yeah.

2390
01:48:57,871 --> 01:48:58,704
They use data from which people who live
in these neighborhoods were ways is now 

2391
01:49:02,461 --> 01:49:03,440
rerouting.
You heard about.

2392
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:06,390
They are furious about that and I'm away
his person.

2393
01:49:06,391 --> 01:49:07,224
So like,
I know you're very familiar with the 

2394
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:11,070
rerouting and it's pretty hilarious.
It's hilarious.

2395
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:11,933
People had these sleepy little 
communities and now it's like it's 

2396
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:18,570
traffic streams of cars going through 
their neighborhood is great though.

2397
01:49:18,690 --> 01:49:19,523
Yeah,
it is great.

2398
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,730
It is great.
I mean it's,

2399
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:21,564
it's amazing how well it predicts your 
time arrival to and the whole like 

2400
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:28,140
notifying you when there's construction 
or police or something.

2401
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:29,101
Yeah.
No,

2402
01:49:29,101 --> 01:49:32,160
it's excellent.
The car's broken down the right lane,

2403
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:33,630
you know,
shift to the left.

2404
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:35,570
You're going to get around it.
Yep.

2405
01:49:35,870 --> 01:49:39,870
I'm,
I'm fascinated by all these advances and

2406
01:49:39,871 --> 01:49:42,250
where they're taking us.
And uh,

2407
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:43,123
I spent a lot of time thinking about it.
I spend a lot of time thinking about 

2408
01:49:45,811 --> 01:49:48,130
what the future or what

2409
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,260
the future holds and where all this 
stuff is going.

2410
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:55,650
And I never,
I never would have imagined 20 years ago

2411
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:58,233
that we would be all addicted to our 
phones and one of the big issues would 

2412
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:02,494
be like one of the new features in the 
iphone shows you how much screen time 

2413
01:50:05,111 --> 01:50:09,070
you have and because when we're doing 
this fitness challenge,

2414
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:12,250
your screen is on all the time because 
you're looking at your screen because it

2415
01:50:12,251 --> 01:50:13,084
shows you the score that you're scaling.
So it's like your screen usage this 

2416
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:19,600
month is up 900 percent.
Like oh no,

2417
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:24,400
that's not good at counting this month 
obviously because of that.

2418
01:50:24,401 --> 01:50:25,234
But there's something to addiction to 
phones and addiction to technology and 

2419
01:50:30,011 --> 01:50:32,410
the fact that it's so a part of our life
that I.

2420
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:33,483
I can only imagine it's going to get 
more and more immersive and we're going 

2421
01:50:36,061 --> 01:50:39,610
to become more and more symbiotic with 
all this electronics mean you're wearing

2422
01:50:39,611 --> 01:50:40,444
a watch that Paula tile and new things 
all the time and you have three phones 

2423
01:50:43,751 --> 01:50:44,250
with you.

2424
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:45,180
Yeah,
I.

2425
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:48,220
on one hand,
I know that it's gotten a,

2426
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:50,310
at least recently,
a little more in the spotlight.

2427
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:54,360
Like Google just added the same thing.
It digital wellbeing feature which tells

2428
01:50:54,361 --> 01:50:55,194
you how much screen time you've had in 
certain apps and we'll let you restrict 

2429
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:03,750
your usage of instagram by a certain 
number of minutes,

2430
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,830
whatever.
As soon the same thing.

2431
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:08,100
They both introduced that within six 
months of each other,

2432
01:51:08,130 --> 01:51:13,130
which is kind of fascinating.
But on the other hand I think I think in

2433
01:51:13,441 --> 01:51:14,274
my own head that I am not addicted yet.
I still unplug every weekend to play 

2434
01:51:20,251 --> 01:51:23,430
ultimate and then I plugged back in on 
Monday.

2435
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:26,800
When you say you unplugged,
meaning you don't check your email,

2436
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:28,660
check your texts?
No,

2437
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:29,290
I mean I,
I,

2438
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:32,980
if I get texts I get them but like as 
far as that mean.

2439
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,590
So like I have my stuff with me but like
when I go,

2440
01:51:35,591 --> 01:51:38,500
when we go play a tournament that's like
you'll have like five games in a day.

2441
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:40,870
So I'd get up at like 7:30.
You go to the fields,

2442
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:42,550
you put your bag down,
you warm up,

2443
01:51:42,551 --> 01:51:43,750
you play a game,
you warm up,

2444
01:51:43,751 --> 01:51:44,670
you play a game,
you warm up,

2445
01:51:44,671 --> 01:51:47,110
you play a game and you'd done about 
like four or 5:00

2446
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:47,860
PM.
Wow.

2447
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:50,680
All Day,
no phone activity.

2448
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:51,790
Yes.
That's amazing.

2449
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:53,410
You're not wearing your watch.
Yeah.

2450
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:55,390
Yeah.
I'm missing out on a lot of points.

2451
01:51:55,890 --> 01:51:58,960
I'd be whooping some people in this 
competition thing,

2452
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:01,090
but I'm clearly not.
Um,

2453
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:01,953
so yeah,
like all day and then we'll have a team 

2454
01:52:02,861 --> 01:52:04,840
dinner and then shower,
sleep,

2455
01:52:04,841 --> 01:52:06,820
wake up the next day,
day two of the tournament.

2456
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:10,260
Sunday you need instead of that risk 
drop,

2457
01:52:10,261 --> 01:52:13,490
you needed like a forearm strap that's 
like on out of

2458
01:52:13,490 --> 01:52:14,460
the way.
Yeah,

2459
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:18,710
like on like one of those tennis fan 
things.

2460
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:19,773
I know I have a couple of friends at 
that play ultimate with that on like 

2461
01:52:22,851 --> 01:52:26,470
under their jersey,
but like the watch is the points.

2462
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:28,490
Like I don't know if the watch,
if I put it up here,

2463
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:31,130
we'll still measure my heart rate and 
all that stuff the same,

2464
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:31,993
but my zone thinks thinks to a 
compression shirt and I know you can 

2465
01:52:34,311 --> 01:52:37,280
sync them eyes on thing to your watch.
The Apple Watch it that way.

2466
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:38,700
I don't know if you could.
I'm pretty sure you.

2467
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,553
What do you mean it syncs to a 
compression to compression shirt that 

2468
01:52:41,361 --> 01:52:44,810
has those little sensors sinks,
but through their.

2469
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:46,250
But

2470
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,820
yeah,
I almost bought it,

2471
01:52:48,821 --> 01:52:51,340
but he snapped the thing into the 
compression for all,

2472
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:53,060
for women in a shirt.
For my God,

2473
01:52:53,061 --> 01:52:55,370
I got to get a Bra.
I'm,

2474
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:58,940
I want to get one of those days because 
the mind's getting super sweaty,

2475
01:52:58,941 --> 01:53:00,590
man.
This thing is losing a lot of.

2476
01:53:00,591 --> 01:53:01,424
It's less density.
It's so gross to instincts that you can 

2477
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:08,010
wash it,
wash it in water and these led drivers.

2478
01:53:08,011 --> 01:53:10,100
So I thought it was electronic,
uh,

2479
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:11,600
isn't going to stink.
Just like,

2480
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:13,820
oh,
just the fabric part.

2481
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:15,123
Oh,
I just assumed that because all this 

2482
01:53:16,191 --> 01:53:18,300
stuff is like you have to voltage 
sensors.

2483
01:53:18,301 --> 01:53:19,134
It's just the sensors or making some 
sort of a contact with these buttons 

2484
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:25,220
which makes a contact with your.
Don't wash the sensor.

2485
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:27,590
Plastic metal.
So don't watch this,

2486
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:28,813
but the rest of it,
it has to go through these pads to get 

2487
01:53:31,011 --> 01:53:31,844
to your skin.

2488
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:34,230
I don't want it to be shitty.
Yeah,

2489
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:35,930
get this straight then.
Okay.

2490
01:53:36,110 --> 01:53:38,690
How many get the shirt?
But yeah,

2491
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,193
it's not,
almost,

2492
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,053
not quite yet.
It's not too late overnight that four 

2493
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:44,780
days.
Yeah.

2494
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:47,600
Um,
augmented reality,

2495
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,040
uh,
you know,

2496
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:49,933
I know that there is a,
there's talk about a contact lens that 

2497
01:53:54,891 --> 01:53:55,724
was being in development that was going 
to be some sort of a lens that's going 

2498
01:53:59,681 --> 01:54:03,860
to allow you to do like a lot of 
minority report type shit in front of.

2499
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:05,173
I think tech is tech as I know it is too
far from that to make that work just 

2500
01:54:09,921 --> 01:54:14,180
because you need like a contact lens you
think of is just like this clear thing.

2501
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:17,180
Maybe some circuits on it or whatever.
But like you need a battery,

2502
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:18,530
right?
And then you need,

2503
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:21,440
unless it operates off your body I 
guess,

2504
01:54:21,441 --> 01:54:22,274
but then you still need some smartwatch 
that operates off the heat of your body 

2505
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:26,430
is.

2506
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:27,263
I mean I don't know how direct,
like even if you do operate off of some 

2507
01:54:30,441 --> 01:54:31,274
other power,
says you need to get that power source 

2508
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:36,050
to connect to the electronics to make it
work,

2509
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:39,290
which still takes some space.
I don't know how much but see,

2510
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:41,120
I don't know.
It seems kind of far out,

2511
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:43,010
it's a,
it's a,

2512
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:46,070
it's a cool idea,
but it also seems really,

2513
01:54:46,071 --> 01:54:46,904
really difficult to put a contact lens 
directly in front of your retina and be 

2514
01:54:50,151 --> 01:54:52,850
able to focus on it and there's a bunch 
of questions I have about it.

2515
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:55,760
I don't know how reasonable or realistic
it is.

2516
01:54:56,060 --> 01:55:01,060
My real fear is that they're going to 
invent a better eye for blind people and

2517
01:55:03,531 --> 01:55:05,960
when they do like,
look how amazing this is.

2518
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:07,940
We've given blind people the ability to 
see,

2519
01:55:07,941 --> 01:55:09,170
again,
optical zoom,

2520
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:10,123
but now they also have all these other 
features that you don't have with your 

2521
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:13,010
regularized.

2522
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:16,430
Let us keep those bad boys out and put 
some fucking.

2523
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:18,720
Some robot eyes,
binocular eyes.

2524
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:22,310
I'm a little worried about that.
Realistically worried about that.

2525
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:23,750
It came.
It came from.

2526
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:24,973
We were watching this video once where 
there was a guy who got his arm and his 

2527
01:55:27,081 --> 01:55:27,914
leg bit off by sharks.
He got attacked by a shark when you're 

2528
01:55:30,801 --> 01:55:31,990
surfing.
So yeah,

2529
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:34,890
this carbon fiber hand that totally 
articulate,

2530
01:55:34,891 --> 01:55:37,460
it's like a real hand and he's standing 
there with his.

2531
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:38,773
From his knee down was an artificial leg
and he was walking around and moving 

2532
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:43,590
like a regular person.
I was like,

2533
01:55:43,591 --> 01:55:44,130
look at this guy.

2534
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,480
This is an incredible.
I'm like,

2535
01:55:45,481 --> 01:55:48,810
he's kind of a bionic guy because his 
hand was moving around.

2536
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:51,510
He could shake your hand and he seemed 
so normal.

2537
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:54,480
I'm like,
what if it gets like many,

2538
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:55,314
many generations better than this where 
it has like Luke skywalker when he got 

2539
01:55:58,671 --> 01:55:59,504
his hand chopped off by Darth Vader,
remember we got that robot hand and 

2540
01:56:02,730 --> 01:56:03,563
history.

2541
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,540
There's people working on this every 
day.

2542
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:09,050
So I kind of figure we're headed in that
direction where like,

2543
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:09,943
what's this Jamie?
So I just googled something at not out 

2544
01:56:12,651 --> 01:56:14,630
yet.
It's because this is called Macula,

2545
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:19,520
which is a Ar Lens that you were with a 
sunglasses.

2546
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:24,130
So in and together they make an air 
station

2547
01:56:24,850 --> 01:56:27,260
glasses,
a lens as a contact,

2548
01:56:27,261 --> 01:56:28,550
and then sunglasses

2549
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:30,040
picture that they,
uh,

2550
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:33,330
that's what they say they got.
So yeah.

2551
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,370
What is the Macula?
Sorry,

2552
01:56:35,490 --> 01:56:40,490
I have a lens here and then go over top.
What do about a creepy dude?

2553
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,430
Wow.
What a picture.

2554
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:44,310
It's not out yet,
it's just this,

2555
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:45,173
you can invest in it.
So it's more like how magic leap was 

2556
01:56:47,071 --> 01:56:48,170
about a year,
year and a half ago.

2557
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:50,730
Like I'm not invested in anything that 
uses guys are covered.

2558
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,240
Boy,
what's up with his face?

2559
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:53,520
Man?
It's a fucking robot,

2560
01:56:53,521 --> 01:56:54,600
man.
He's an alien.

2561
01:56:54,601 --> 01:56:58,820
He looks like the guy from men in black.
Remember when the alien put the skin on.

2562
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:01,773
Remember?

2563
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:02,783
That's what he looks like here.
Something wrong with the left side of 

2564
01:57:04,171 --> 01:57:05,004
his face,
man.

2565
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,870
He's wearing someone's skin.

2566
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:11,250
That's a weird system.
So a lens in a contact.

2567
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:15,700
So the battery might be in the glass and
the glasses and it's working and I don't

2568
01:57:15,701 --> 01:57:16,740
know how it's connected,
but.

2569
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:18,600
Hmm.
Wow.

2570
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:20,250
Well we.
This is.

2571
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:23,370
Who knows what this is.
Here's the other thing.

2572
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:26,490
I don't need the information that fast,
that bad.

2573
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,533
I'm okay with a one second delay of 
picking up my phone and checking it 

2574
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:32,400
instead of [inaudible] like,
what are you getting with?

2575
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:34,920
You saw the note.
The examples were like incoming call,

2576
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,260
the weather,
your emails,

2577
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,903
things like that.
Like information you can already get in 

2578
01:57:40,781 --> 01:57:42,750
two seconds by just.
Yep.

2579
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,550
I have an incoming call.
I have an email.

2580
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:47,880
I have a text like that pretty quick,
pretty quick.

2581
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:48,743
And I've,
I've said this before where someone has 

2582
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:51,323
asked me like,
are we at like the final form of 

2583
01:57:53,521 --> 01:57:54,810
smartphones?
Like where are they going to go?

2584
01:57:54,811 --> 01:57:56,550
Are we going to get bigger?
I'm going to get smaller.

2585
01:57:56,590 --> 01:57:57,423
Are they going to be implanted in you?
I think smartphones are at like pretty 

2586
01:58:01,711 --> 01:58:06,090
much their final form.
We're going to keep evolving the insides

2587
01:58:06,091 --> 01:58:08,460
of smartphones to be better.
They're going to get faster,

2588
01:58:08,461 --> 01:58:11,550
they're going to get more and more 
transparent,

2589
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:12,384
whatever.
They'll get like more interesting 

2590
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:14,004
looking,
but I think it's always going to be a 

2591
01:58:15,061 --> 01:58:18,870
thing I pick up and use and then put it 
back down.

2592
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:21,570
I think that's where we're at for a 
while.

2593
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:22,703
Um,
w what are your thoughts on Samsung's 

2594
01:58:24,361 --> 01:58:25,590
foldable screens

2595
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:29,890
that I am very curious about because 
again,

2596
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:34,840
sounds awesome,
but why do I fold it?

2597
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:35,793
Why?
What am I doing with it and how big is 

2598
01:58:37,151 --> 01:58:37,984
it going to get yet?
Am I so like maybe so we had this a 

2599
01:58:41,141 --> 01:58:43,660
while ago when we started first getting 
this big phones,

2600
01:58:43,661 --> 01:58:46,180
they were like,
oh you could have a really big phone,

2601
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:47,463
like a tablet,
but then you fold it in half and it's a 

2602
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:49,983
phone size now,
but like I might as well just have a 

2603
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:57,610
phone and a tablet unless I don't know 
if I need both to remember the Samsung.

2604
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:02,640
What was that giant thing that they had 
that was bigger than a note a while.

2605
01:59:03,131 --> 01:59:06,580
They have small tablets but they had a,
it was a phone.

2606
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,190
Oh,
the galaxy mega.

2607
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:11,163
Yeah,
they have like the weird thing is like 

2608
01:59:12,701 --> 01:59:13,534
that I think was like a six and a half 
inch screen and that's where we're at 

2609
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:16,560
now.

2610
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,500
Was it really?
Yeah,

2611
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:20,770
it was massive compared to what we had 
also in the market,

2612
01:59:20,771 --> 01:59:23,500
which was like five inch screens.
I never saw one in the wild.

2613
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:25,110
I reviewed one.
Yeah,

2614
01:59:25,111 --> 01:59:25,944
it was,
it was way bigger than any other phone 

2615
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:27,873
out,
but I'm pretty sure if I looked back 

2616
01:59:29,561 --> 01:59:31,870
that was like a six and a half inch 
screen.

2617
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:34,120
It was less than seven inch.
I think that's the sweet spot.

2618
01:59:34,121 --> 01:59:39,121
Seven inch screen tablet,
six inch screen phone and I think yeah,

2619
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:42,990
this is a six point two inch screen.
This is a six point five.

2620
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:46,290
Six point five inch screen.
So what's that?

2621
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:49,990
It was six point three.
So that's bigger than the galaxy mega.

2622
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:52,360
That's crazy.
Look at that thing.

2623
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,313
Endless entertainment mega for x zoom.
But that thing's still had the forehead 

2624
01:59:59,411 --> 02:00:00,244
and the bezels on the Chin and bad.
Really in comparison to that horrible 

2625
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:05,793
iphone eight.
It's Kinda the same galaxy mega 16 

2626
02:00:08,381 --> 02:00:10,930
gigabytes.
Woo Baby.

2627
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,620
Wow.
Look at that thing.

2628
02:00:14,621 --> 02:00:16,840
That's so weird.
I wonder what year that was.

2629
02:00:16,841 --> 02:00:18,140
That was like,
no,

2630
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:20,620
don't tell me.
That was probably college.

2631
02:00:20,621 --> 02:00:23,500
So like 2014,
20.

2632
02:00:23,501 --> 02:00:25,390
Pulled that thing out.
You were a pimp.

2633
02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:29,590
Like what are you doing with touch and 
shine as movies all the time?

2634
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:32,200
Battery life.
Forty four minutes.

2635
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:35,830
That was a fun time.
Yeah,

2636
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:38,950
it's crazy when you connect your phone 
to your car.

2637
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:41,260
Here's the other one that just happened.
The,

2638
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:43,990
this tiny palm phone.
Uh,

2639
02:00:43,991 --> 02:00:44,824
I don't know if you've seen this.
So it's like a super small phone 

2640
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:53,340
accessory to your normal phone,
so it does almost everything your normal

2641
02:00:54,251 --> 02:00:55,900
phone does,
but it's way smaller.

2642
02:00:55,960 --> 02:01:00,960
It has like a half of the.
It says congratulations.

2643
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:05,020
You've launched the stupidest product of
the year.

2644
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:10,120
If it's a phone accessory to your phone,
they could have just made a small phone.

2645
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:13,450
That would have been fine.
But then they made this,

2646
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:14,500
this whole thing.
We're like,

2647
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:15,363
oh,
but it has to connect to your other 

2648
02:01:17,591 --> 02:01:22,591
phone and then it uses the same phone 
number but it works sometimes.

2649
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:24,693
And steph curry is our ambassador and I 
don't know anymore why someone would 

2650
02:01:29,231 --> 02:01:30,064
want to get that.
So how close does it have to be your 

2651
02:01:31,461 --> 02:01:33,160
regular phone?
Uh,

2652
02:01:33,161 --> 02:01:36,250
I think it has its own data or 
something.

2653
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,840
I Dunno.
It's Kinda like an apple watch.

2654
02:01:37,841 --> 02:01:38,674
Like it's an accessory to your phone 
that kind of is the same form factor as 

2655
02:01:42,471 --> 02:01:43,460
a phone.
You put it in your pocket,

2656
02:01:43,461 --> 02:01:44,294
you like go to the gym and you just 
bring that instead of bringing the main 

2657
02:01:45,771 --> 02:01:46,604
phone or you just go on a hike and you 
just don't want to bring your whole 

2658
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,690
setup so you just bring the little

2659
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:54,240
be in the meeting with whatever cokehead
came up with that idea.

2660
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:55,393
I don't know.
I can't think of any other really great 

2661
02:01:57,551 --> 02:02:00,090
reasons to have it.
Well I think the iphone,

2662
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:02,650
the apple watch sort of has it nailed 
right.

2663
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:03,523
You get your notifications,
but if it's excessive or that you enjoy 

2664
02:02:06,941 --> 02:02:07,774
it even though you're not even using it 
for a lot of the features I'm using for 

2665
02:02:10,781 --> 02:02:13,300
the fitness aspect.
And what else do you use on it?

2666
02:02:13,950 --> 02:02:15,240
Whether or.
Yeah,

2667
02:02:15,241 --> 02:02:16,800
so like it's,
I have the four g version,

2668
02:02:16,801 --> 02:02:21,060
I get the weather and also it has the 
ability to make calls.

2669
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:22,410
I do,
but I never do.

2670
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:23,573
We never do.
Like if I wanted to call a restaurant 

2671
02:02:25,081 --> 02:02:26,250
and see what kind of,
you know,

2672
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:28,830
hours they have,
I could say hey siri and make a call.

2673
02:02:28,831 --> 02:02:29,780
But yeah.

2674
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,110
Yeah.
Now is there nothing commensurate in the

2675
02:02:34,111 --> 02:02:34,950
Google world?

2676
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:40,450
I mean there's other smartwatches.
There is technically A.

2677
02:02:40,450 --> 02:02:41,283
Samsung also makes their own,
but they have a galaxy smartwatch that 

2678
02:02:43,521 --> 02:02:45,610
has like a kind of a cool spinning 
thing.

2679
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:46,810
Yeah.
Galaxy Watch.

2680
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,113
Yeah.
It's probably the best android 

2681
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:53,020
compatible smartwatch.
Huawei has a kind of a cool one too.

2682
02:02:53,021 --> 02:02:53,854
Right?
So why we did this thing that I thought 

2683
02:02:55,541 --> 02:02:59,650
was is the good try.
It was a good try.

2684
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:01,563
It was a smartwatch that has a digital 
screen but then had a mechanical hand 

2685
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:11,670
like so that it looked like a normal 
watch on the screen is not on.

2686
02:03:12,430 --> 02:03:13,263
The problem with that is when you go to 
look at like your notifications or 

2687
02:03:15,761 --> 02:03:19,180
whatever you get the hands are blocking 
the screen.

2688
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,730
So they didn't really think too hard 
about.

2689
02:03:21,990 --> 02:03:23,770
I mean they,
they got to that point and they're like,

2690
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:24,633
oh you know what we'll do,
we'll have this button where you press 

2691
02:03:26,231 --> 02:03:30,550
it and then the hands like move out the 
way and then the screen,

2692
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:33,460
the notification will like move to the 
side so you can read it.

2693
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:38,410
It was.
They tried,

2694
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:40,510
they really tried.
They tried to be different.

2695
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:43,030
I respect the hell out of that.
Good try wowway.

2696
02:03:43,031 --> 02:03:44,440
But no.

2697
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:48,130
Now do people,
do companies ever come to you and say,

2698
02:03:48,131 --> 02:03:48,964
hey man,
you're really good at reviewing these 

2699
02:03:50,201 --> 02:03:51,160
things?
Um,

2700
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:52,630
are we [inaudible] up here?

2701
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:54,663
Uh,
Kinda sorta red came to me before this 

2702
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:00,773
existed in it's in this form a and it 
wasn't a prototype phase and they were 

2703
02:04:04,201 --> 02:04:06,210
still pretty far along,
but it was kinda like,

2704
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:08,970
should we do this?
Should we put this here?

2705
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:10,860
Should we keep the headphone Jack?
I was,

2706
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:12,650
I was giving them sort of,
yeah,

2707
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:14,700
they kept the headphone Jack.
Little things like that.

2708
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:17,460
Um,
but for the most part,

2709
02:04:17,461 --> 02:04:18,294
I think what a lot of people don't 
understand about product development is 

2710
02:04:20,251 --> 02:04:22,080
it happens many,
many,

2711
02:04:22,081 --> 02:04:24,350
many,
many months before you ever see the,

2712
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:27,000
the products show up.
So I don't know if you remember,

2713
02:04:27,001 --> 02:04:27,834
like all the leaks about the pixel xl,
all of them guarantee six months before 

2714
02:04:31,141 --> 02:04:32,160
the iphone came out.
It was done.

2715
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:35,640
Like they knew that that's what it was.
Gonna more than I think any phone that I

2716
02:04:35,641 --> 02:04:36,750
can recall.
Yeah.

2717
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:37,613
So that's the same as the iphone,
like they've been working on the 

2718
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:41,033
whatever the next iphone is,
they've been working on that iphone and 

2719
02:04:43,231 --> 02:04:44,064
it's probably going to be like a couple 
more months and then they're like 

2720
02:04:46,501 --> 02:04:50,580
finalizing design and things like that.
And so when you start to see phones come

2721
02:04:50,581 --> 02:04:51,414
out like around like September and 
October and they start to all kind of 

2722
02:04:55,291 --> 02:04:58,410
resemble each other and then another one
comes out and it looks the same.

2723
02:04:58,411 --> 02:04:59,244
It's not like they saw the phone in 
early October and they were like let's 

2724
02:05:01,501 --> 02:05:02,334
copy that.
And then they made the next phone two 

2725
02:05:03,451 --> 02:05:06,390
weeks later they've been working on this
forever.

2726
02:05:06,391 --> 02:05:07,224
So like when the whole,
like the whole notch thing was people 

2727
02:05:10,381 --> 02:05:12,550
were like,
oh I hope Google's trolling us.

2728
02:05:12,551 --> 02:05:13,384
Then that's not really the notch.
And they're going to have this phone 

2729
02:05:14,611 --> 02:05:15,444
with no notch.

2730
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:16,373
Now it's,
they've been working on this for a long 

2731
02:05:17,671 --> 02:05:19,080
time.
This is what they planned.

2732
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:23,070
What is that one phone where the back 
slides up for the selfie camera.

2733
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:24,413
So there's two,
I think what you're thinking of Apo 

2734
02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:26,243
fine.
10.

2735
02:05:26,410 --> 02:05:27,900
Yeah,
that's a pretty.

2736
02:05:27,901 --> 02:05:30,360
I like the idea,
it's pretty cool,

2737
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:31,111
but I'm like,
man,

2738
02:05:31,111 --> 02:05:33,840
how long is that thing gonna work?
That's the question.

2739
02:05:33,990 --> 02:05:37,130
So phones are no chips in there.
Yeah,

2740
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:40,050
any little bit of breeze motors?
Yeah.

2741
02:05:40,051 --> 02:05:42,570
Phones are solid state for the most part
for good reason.

2742
02:05:42,571 --> 02:05:43,404
You don't want a lot of moving parts in 
a phone that you're like running around 

2743
02:05:45,661 --> 02:05:46,494
with A.
There's another one called the Vivo 

2744
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:50,370
Apex.
A.

2745
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:51,870
No,
it's another vivo phone.

2746
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:52,793
Basically.
Nex is what it's called and it has just 

2747
02:05:54,661 --> 02:05:55,494
the selfie camera pop up.
Testing that one too and that's another 

2748
02:05:58,111 --> 02:05:58,680
thing.
It's like,

2749
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:00,900
well what if a grain of sand gets in 
there?

2750
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,460
Like is it toasts?
Immediately,

2751
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:05,190
drop that soccer on the beefy,
drop it while it's open.

2752
02:06:05,191 --> 02:06:08,000
Is that over by evo next?
Yes.

2753
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:10,740
Any excess or next?
I don't know if I'm supposed to say next

2754
02:06:10,741 --> 02:06:13,050
or whatever,
but that's a.

2755
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,720
it's an interesting.
It looks cool because now look,

2756
02:06:15,721 --> 02:06:17,370
you have the fingerprint reader under 
the glass.

2757
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:18,473
You have all the way to the bottom of 
the screen and then all the way to the 

2758
02:06:20,071 --> 02:06:21,960
top is the screen and then you just have
the selfie camera.

2759
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:24,020
It looks amazing.
Awesome.

2760
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:24,780
Yeah.
No,

2761
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:26,250
no bezels at all.
Yeah.

2762
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:27,113
Or basically no.
Bezels pretty much tiny chin at the 

2763
02:06:29,101 --> 02:06:32,400
bottom.
So that's the idea is like we're in this

2764
02:06:32,401 --> 02:06:35,430
sort of a race to get to a Bezel this 
phone.

2765
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:36,883
Um,
and I guess that's the closest we can 

2766
02:06:39,691 --> 02:06:40,524
get right now.
It's just having a little mechanical 

2767
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:42,780
thing pop out.

2768
02:06:42,780 --> 02:06:46,470
I think what we want is a,
the stuff to be behind the glass.

2769
02:06:46,580 --> 02:06:48,540
Yeah.
A camera behind the glass.

2770
02:06:48,541 --> 02:06:51,240
But then how would you see the image?
Yeah,

2771
02:06:51,330 --> 02:06:52,163
so I think if,
based on what I know about the physics 

2772
02:06:55,921 --> 02:06:56,754
of the technology you need,
you need an oled display and you need 

2773
02:07:00,271 --> 02:07:01,104
the camera to be behind the oled display
and then when you light up the camera 

2774
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,233
you need like a little black circle 
where those pixels are off so that they 

2775
02:07:09,871 --> 02:07:10,704
can shine through.
I don't know if this is all making 

2776
02:07:11,611 --> 02:07:12,444
sense.
I think you're still going to always 

2777
02:07:13,681 --> 02:07:18,681
have some sort of a black circle in the 
front of the phone somewhere.

2778
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,833
It's fascinating about iphone versus 
android is that there's so much more 

2779
02:07:23,071 --> 02:07:23,904
room for possibility with android 
because you have so many different 

2780
02:07:26,011 --> 02:07:29,220
manufacturers that are competing in that
marketplace.

2781
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:30,083
They're trying to find some sort of a 
way to shine and that was where the 

2782
02:07:33,571 --> 02:07:34,404
wall.
Wait,

2783
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:36,040
was it the mate rs

2784
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:37,443
with like the Porsche Design version 
where I thought that was a really 

2785
02:07:40,061 --> 02:07:42,520
interesting film because it was stupid 
expensive,

2786
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:47,910
but it had a gigantic battery and had an
incredible 20 megapixel camera.

2787
02:07:48,970 --> 02:07:52,240
Great night photos.
Low light photos.

2788
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:53,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

2789
02:07:53,261 --> 02:07:53,720
They,
they,

2790
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:56,160
they really tried to do like,
you know,

2791
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:57,850
Porsche designed does a lot of different
things.

2792
02:07:57,851 --> 02:08:00,180
They do sunglasses.
Yeah.

2793
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:01,663
Ballpoint pens.
They do all kinds of weird stuff and 

2794
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:05,500
really has nothing to do with the car,
but what they've really.

2795
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:06,933
They design.
They came up with something really high 

2796
02:08:09,581 --> 02:08:13,060
end and they showed there's some sort of
a market for that.

2797
02:08:13,150 --> 02:08:13,901
Is that it right there?
Yeah,

2798
02:08:13,901 --> 02:08:17,350
that's it again.
Phone now they did with the mate 20.

2799
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:20,590
They did the same thing,
it's a great looking fun,

2800
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:22,173
but it's a again,
when you look at like how much you have 

2801
02:08:24,491 --> 02:08:27,010
to pay versus what extra you're getting.

2802
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:31,700
You might as well just get the mate 20 
pro and not worry about the science.

2803
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:35,680
People want that Porsche design.
Then just to go look at me.

2804
02:08:35,681 --> 02:08:38,440
I'm a baller.
They made a bitch fade.

2805
02:08:38,890 --> 02:08:41,950
They did the same like Porsche does that
Lamborghini does that.

2806
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:44,260
A Ferrari does that?
Tesla does that.

2807
02:08:44,261 --> 02:08:47,650
There is a,
a Lamborghini addition.

2808
02:08:47,651 --> 02:08:49,350
Apo fine 10.
Yeah.

2809
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:50,813
Like carbon fiber and phone though.
You got to put it on the car and it 

2810
02:08:54,611 --> 02:08:56,050
looks dope on the car.
Of course.

2811
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:59,710
That's a dope looking phone period.
Did you mess with that phone at all?

2812
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:00,631
Uh,
I,

2813
02:09:00,631 --> 02:09:02,920
I mess with the May 20 but not the 
porsche design one,

2814
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:03,843
but it comes down to like using the 
phone itself is going to be pretty much 

2815
02:09:07,421 --> 02:09:09,790
the same.
Like once you get past like the design,

2816
02:09:09,791 --> 02:09:10,624
which is a little bit different,
you open up the phone and the software 

2817
02:09:12,521 --> 02:09:13,354
is you'd get a cool couple wallpapers 
but like it's the same phone and on the 

2818
02:09:16,661 --> 02:09:20,710
inside a little more storage maybe,
but basically the same thing.

2819
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:22,113
But I just,
I find it fascinating that they've 

2820
02:09:23,441 --> 02:09:26,650
decided to go that far out into the high
end,

2821
02:09:26,651 --> 02:09:28,300
deep end.
Yeah.

2822
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:32,680
I guess you have to differentiate 
yourself at $20,000,

2823
02:09:32,681 --> 02:09:33,160
right?
Yeah.

2824
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,993
Starts at $2,000.
So I guess as hype as you want to get 

2825
02:09:36,101 --> 02:09:38,320
about it,
like are you going to go pay $2,000

2826
02:09:38,321 --> 02:09:39,700
for that?
Probably not.

2827
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:43,290
But then when the note nine came out,
it kind of took a lot of the window.

2828
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:44,133
They're sales battery was the same size 
cameras for fairly similar big ass 

2829
02:09:48,761 --> 02:09:49,594
screen.
And the other thing about phones is we 

2830
02:09:52,041 --> 02:09:52,874
got all these phones that are a thousand
dollars now and it's made it so easy to 

2831
02:09:57,851 --> 02:10:01,110
just bump up the price of your phone and
not have anyone blink an eye.

2832
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:02,303
I've been thinking about that a lot.
We have the iphone 10 starts at a 

2833
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:06,670
thousand dollars,
right?

2834
02:10:06,670 --> 02:10:11,670
So then the iphone 10 art came out and I
think they could have priced it anywhere

2835
02:10:12,071 --> 02:10:15,310
from 6:50
to 8:50

2836
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:17,890
and they just nestle it right in there 
at 7:15

2837
02:10:17,891 --> 02:10:18,311
and you're like,
oh,

2838
02:10:18,311 --> 02:10:21,820
that's way cheaper.
So then this phone comes out Pixel Pixel

2839
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:22,833
and Pixel xl.
You probably don't remember what the 

2840
02:10:24,521 --> 02:10:28,000
Pixel to cost,
but the pixel three starts at seven 99,

2841
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:30,610
which seems like that's pretty 
reasonable,

2842
02:10:30,611 --> 02:10:33,470
right in that range.
That's a hundred $50 more expensive than

2843
02:10:33,471 --> 02:10:34,304
last year.

2844
02:10:34,950 --> 02:10:35,783
Why?
Like what's so much better about pixel 

2845
02:10:39,171 --> 02:10:41,860
three then pixel to that.
It's a dollar is more.

2846
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:43,003
The market is just lifted everything 
plus $200 so that a thousand dollars as 

2847
02:10:47,891 --> 02:10:50,360
a high end now.
And I think that's what's convinced.

2848
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:51,223
Companies like Wowway,
like if we want to compete with apple 

2849
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:55,820
and really make what seems and looks 
like a premium phone,

2850
02:10:55,970 --> 02:10:59,750
we have to charge $1,200
so that people know it's better than the

2851
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:01,790
iphone.
If we charge $800,

2852
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,920
they're not gonna think it's better than
the iphone.

2853
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:05,263
We have to charge more than apple 
charging to prove that we have more in 

2854
02:11:08,481 --> 02:11:09,270
our phone,

2855
02:11:09,270 --> 02:11:12,450
but plus is interesting because they're 
really reasonable,

2856
02:11:12,451 --> 02:11:13,680
but their specs are very high.

2857
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:14,790
I liked them.
They,

2858
02:11:14,791 --> 02:11:15,624
they've had a good history of like they 
usually listen to what people seem to 

2859
02:11:18,551 --> 02:11:19,384
want and a phone and they're also good 
at like picking high end numbers that 

2860
02:11:22,301 --> 02:11:23,134
look great on paper and usually 
translate pretty well to using the 

2861
02:11:26,381 --> 02:11:27,670
phone.
Uh,

2862
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:29,163
but they always cut out.
They cut as many corners as they can to 

2863
02:11:32,561 --> 02:11:34,990
get the price as low as they can.
Their phone.

2864
02:11:34,991 --> 02:11:37,420
Last year it was about 550 bucks,
right.

2865
02:11:38,110 --> 02:11:40,030
All glass,
but no wireless charging.

2866
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:42,220
But it's glass.
We have dual cameras.

2867
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:44,680
You hardly ever use a second camera,
but it's still cameras.

2868
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:47,710
Uh,
eight gigs of Ram snapdragon 8:45.

2869
02:11:47,711 --> 02:11:50,080
A lot of phones have the same specs now 
these days.

2870
02:11:50,081 --> 02:11:53,740
But like they've gotten pretty good at 
like going the opposite direction.

2871
02:11:53,741 --> 02:11:55,600
Like we're not going to charge a 
thousand bucks.

2872
02:11:55,601 --> 02:11:58,780
We're going to make a that same phone.
Trust us,

2873
02:11:58,781 --> 02:12:01,090
it's the same,
but for way less money,

2874
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:02,083
that's,
that's a much more popular direction to 

2875
02:12:03,491 --> 02:12:04,660
go.
As far as sales,

2876
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:05,663
no.
They've done the same strategy for the 

2877
02:12:06,541 --> 02:12:08,040
newest one plus.
Yep.

2878
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:10,500
And they're coming out with a new one 
this month.

2879
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,570
Oh,
one plus 16.

2880
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:16,170
They.
They keep the headphone Jack so far.

2881
02:12:16,290 --> 02:12:18,660
So far.
Jack is a weird one.

2882
02:12:18,661 --> 02:12:19,430
Right?
It's like,

2883
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:21,570
how is Samsung going to hold onto that 
sucker?

2884
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:22,433
Samsung's been very popular for keeping 
the headphone Jack and not having a 

2885
02:12:25,291 --> 02:12:26,124
notch.
They're like the last ones to have a 

2886
02:12:28,621 --> 02:12:31,140
headphone Jack and no notch.
Well,

2887
02:12:31,141 --> 02:12:35,070
I'm a big fan of the way the note nine 
looks when I'm using it.

2888
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:40,140
That's a beautiful device.
It feels net premium and the hand.

2889
02:12:40,170 --> 02:12:41,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

2890
02:12:41,850 --> 02:12:44,160
What do you think is wrong with it?
With no nine?

2891
02:12:44,210 --> 02:12:45,043
Yeah.

2892
02:12:45,070 --> 02:12:50,070
My biggest problem with note nine is the
front facing camera and the software and

2893
02:12:50,741 --> 02:12:52,750
the software is not even that bad.
It's just,

2894
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:56,050
it's gotten slow for me quickly.
A lot of times,

2895
02:12:56,051 --> 02:12:56,884
like I've been using note nine.
I also don't think it's the prettiest 

2896
02:12:58,871 --> 02:13:01,360
software.
I really like Samsung screens,

2897
02:13:01,361 --> 02:13:02,860
so I know they can make good looking 
stuff,

2898
02:13:03,010 --> 02:13:06,400
but I think if they made A.
I don't know if you remember Google play

2899
02:13:06,401 --> 02:13:07,234
addition when they used to do that,
if they made a Google play edition 

2900
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:11,193
galaxy note nine,
I would instantly by that phone that 

2901
02:13:13,231 --> 02:13:14,064
would be sick because I love Google's 
like software being cleaner and looking 

2902
02:13:17,441 --> 02:13:20,180
a little better.
If you look at Samsung software,

2903
02:13:20,181 --> 02:13:22,090
it looks kind of cartoony a lot of 
times.

2904
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:24,580
Very colorful.
Not a problem,

2905
02:13:24,581 --> 02:13:25,660
but it's just not my favorite.

2906
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:26,653
I know some people have figured out a 
way to use the google launcher on other 

2907
02:13:30,261 --> 02:13:32,790
phones,
so they other phones look like a pixel.

2908
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:33,840
Yeah,
you can.

2909
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:35,003
You can go.
You can only go so far back like you 

2910
02:13:37,381 --> 02:13:38,214
can.
You can use the Google launcher and you 

2911
02:13:39,391 --> 02:13:40,224
can use an icon packed use google icons,
but still you're going to have your 

2912
02:13:43,411 --> 02:13:45,520
settings pull down.
It's still gonna look like Samsung.

2913
02:13:45,521 --> 02:13:46,354
You're going to have in the apps,
like the settings app is still going to 

2914
02:13:48,751 --> 02:13:52,710
look like the Samsung settings app.
You're still gonna have three email apps

2915
02:13:52,711 --> 02:13:54,270
and three messaging apps and all this 
stuff.

2916
02:13:54,271 --> 02:13:55,060
Samsung on his does,

2917
02:13:55,060 --> 02:13:56,720
but yeah,
the messaging apps are weird.

2918
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,500
Do you want this one to beard to fault 
and like.

2919
02:13:58,510 --> 02:13:59,530
I don't know what that is.

2920
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:01,050
Yeah,
I just that one.

2921
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:03,030
I just want to use one and not have a 
message.

2922
02:14:03,031 --> 02:14:04,080
Plus.
Yeah,

2923
02:14:04,150 --> 02:14:08,280
like why is it better if you use a 
verizon Samsung note,

2924
02:14:08,281 --> 02:14:09,114
I think you end up with three messaging 
apps like verizon messages of rise in 

2925
02:14:13,231 --> 02:14:18,231
Messenger and then there's the message 
plus on this Google's messenger and it's

2926
02:14:18,321 --> 02:14:19,154
just a lot and then there's hangouts and
then how do I even get in touch with so 

2927
02:14:22,241 --> 02:14:23,010
on anymore.

2928
02:14:23,010 --> 02:14:23,843
It's a lot.
I'm wondering if there's ever going to 

2929
02:14:24,901 --> 02:14:25,734
be a time where something happens 
technologically where the walled garden 

2930
02:14:30,181 --> 02:14:33,510
of apple sort of dissolves and 
everything becomes accessible.

2931
02:14:33,770 --> 02:14:34,603
Apple will fight till they die to let 
that wall that they will never let that 

2932
02:14:38,511 --> 02:14:39,440
go down.
That's.

2933
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:43,730
That's like one of their biggest,
most prideful accomplishment is building

2934
02:14:43,731 --> 02:14:44,564
that wall.

2935
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:45,473
I mean,
they really have nailed it now other 

2936
02:14:47,101 --> 02:14:50,520
than brand loyalty and other than the 
prestige of having an apple product,

2937
02:14:50,521 --> 02:14:52,110
which is all very high.
Yeah.

2938
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:54,400
That walled garden,
that's where it's at.

2939
02:14:54,510 --> 02:14:59,510
Have you ever tried to leave an iphone?
I did like that's a thing.

2940
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:00,710
Yeah.
Okay.

2941
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:02,190
It was a fucking nightmare.
Yep.

2942
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:03,093
I,
I couldn't get text messages and very 

2943
02:15:04,851 --> 02:15:05,661
calm.
And here's the thing.

2944
02:15:05,661 --> 02:15:06,494
I even called up apple and I said,
I want you to remove me from your 

2945
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:11,810
message.
Yeah.

2946
02:15:11,810 --> 02:15:12,440
From your.
I'm,

2947
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:14,840
I gave them my email address.
I gave them a phone number,

2948
02:15:14,841 --> 02:15:18,440
the whole deal and they will why I go 
because I went with a pixel phone and it

2949
02:15:18,441 --> 02:15:21,440
was like a pause.
Like I just ate a baby.

2950
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:24,320
It's a different phone.
You Fox.

2951
02:15:24,321 --> 02:15:27,260
I'm trying to find a different phone.
Will let me out,

2952
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:29,540
let me out.
So then I call my friend.

2953
02:15:29,541 --> 02:15:30,290
I go,
hey man,

2954
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:32,220
send me a text.
Send me a text.

2955
02:15:32,990 --> 02:15:34,940
I sent that shit.
Nothing.

2956
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,100
Now I'm going to send you a text.
Nothing,

2957
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:38,390
nothing.
I'll go,

2958
02:15:38,391 --> 02:15:39,800
okay,
I'm going to shut it off.

2959
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:41,090
Turn it back on.
Nothing,

2960
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:43,250
you have to start with a new phone 
number.

2961
02:15:43,310 --> 02:15:44,540
The Wall.
Yeah.

2962
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:46,340
You have to literally start with a new 
number.

2963
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:49,390
You have to start from scratch and then 
people get that green mess.

2964
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:50,513
The reason why I don't make my main 
phone number and I found it because I 

2965
02:15:53,101 --> 02:15:55,590
know I'm like lowering myself into the 
garden.

2966
02:15:55,650 --> 02:15:56,483
Like I can use an iphone,
but that will probably never be my main 

2967
02:15:59,011 --> 02:16:00,300
sim.
I have two sims.

2968
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:03,090
My main number,
the one everyone has an android phone.

2969
02:16:03,091 --> 02:16:05,500
I think it'll stay that way as long as 
that's the way

2970
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:10,770
I feel like you in your particular 
profession as a and you're a reviewer of

2971
02:16:11,311 --> 02:16:12,144
all these things.
I think you kind of have to do that 

2972
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:16,050
because otherwise you'd be in this weird
position of

2973
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:18,690
not being able to leave.
That was the thing.

2974
02:16:18,691 --> 02:16:20,270
Okay.
So there is a video,

2975
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:21,173
Lou data.
Actually we keep saying Lulu from unbox 

2976
02:16:24,121 --> 02:16:25,680
therapy,
clarify.

2977
02:16:25,790 --> 02:16:27,330
Um,
which was like,

2978
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:29,230
it was.
We all went to ces in January,

2979
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:30,133
all in vegas every year in January.
And we just went around the room and 

2980
02:16:32,021 --> 02:16:33,790
just went,
what phone do you use?

2981
02:16:33,970 --> 02:16:34,803
I saw that,
which is what phone is in your pocket 

2982
02:16:36,551 --> 02:16:37,450
right now?
Take it out,

2983
02:16:37,451 --> 02:16:40,690
show us with fung,
use iphone after iphone after iphone.

2984
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:42,010
And there was a couple of pixels in 
there,

2985
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:43,900
but every time you ask an iphone person 
like,

2986
02:16:43,901 --> 02:16:45,400
so why?
And I felt and they're like,

2987
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:48,410
man,
I'm message facetime.

2988
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:49,323
Like that ecosystem is real.
You Louis seemed angry about being more 

2989
02:16:53,951 --> 02:16:55,750
people weren't using pixels.
Well,

2990
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:57,700
there was a whole thing about,
uh,

2991
02:16:58,210 --> 02:16:59,043
just whatever phone.
There's a lot of people who do a 

2992
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:05,230
sponsored videos where they'll talk 
about a phone as if they use it,

2993
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:06,213
but they don't.

2994
02:17:06,550 --> 02:17:07,383
And that was one of the things that at 
ces specifically that we kind of had a 

2995
02:17:11,021 --> 02:17:11,854
laugh with at our studio because you 
would think like if you watched 

2996
02:17:14,621 --> 02:17:15,580
everyone's videos,
like,

2997
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:16,930
oh,
everyone's using a wowway.

2998
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:17,793
Everyone.
I guess while we had a big budget for 

2999
02:17:18,821 --> 02:17:23,821
ces and they just paid a bunch of people
to make mate 10 pro videos at ces.

3000
02:17:25,330 --> 02:17:27,970
So if you,
if you went into watching a video,

3001
02:17:27,971 --> 02:17:31,450
like what phone is in everyone's pocket,
I think you would just assume everyone's

3002
02:17:31,451 --> 02:17:33,610
got away mate.
Ten pro and nobody did,

3003
02:17:33,730 --> 02:17:36,010
which is really funny.
That's dirty.

3004
02:17:36,190 --> 02:17:38,800
And then the other thing is about wally.
I hate trashing while away,

3005
02:17:38,801 --> 02:17:41,320
but I also kind of left trashing wildly,
uh,

3006
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:42,243
is they have a lot of money to pay 
celebrities to tweet ads for awhile way 

3007
02:17:47,801 --> 02:17:50,890
basically Gaga being one of them.
Right.

3008
02:17:50,891 --> 02:17:52,740
And you heard this story,
uh,

3009
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:53,853
so she's tweeted a bunch of wally ads 
and I noticed that while she's a brand 

3010
02:17:57,731 --> 02:18:01,570
ambassador for awhile way tweeting ads,
but how much he loves her Huawei phone.

3011
02:18:02,470 --> 02:18:03,303
If you look in the details of the tweet,
it's always via twitter for iphone and 

3012
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:10,150
it's like whatever.
She can use an iphone.

3013
02:18:10,151 --> 02:18:10,984
I don't care,
but I thought it was funny so I just 

3014
02:18:11,771 --> 02:18:13,570
tweeted it,
it blew up.

3015
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:16,780
And uh,
I had walway reached out to me like,

3016
02:18:16,781 --> 02:18:18,910
how did you find this?
How did you know,

3017
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:21,640
where did you,
is this a mistake?

3018
02:18:21,641 --> 02:18:22,930
Like,
could this be a pr?

3019
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,740
Like,
has this ever malfunction?

3020
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:25,211
I'm like,
no,

3021
02:18:25,211 --> 02:18:27,160
this is,
that's how twitter works.

3022
02:18:27,161 --> 02:18:29,620
Like you can see the data.
It's clearly an iphone.

3023
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:32,410
And I thought that was Larry.
Larry.

3024
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:34,150
That's my screenshot.
And so,

3025
02:18:34,151 --> 02:18:38,140
uh,
not only did Gaga Dope Bloch Gal Godot,

3026
02:18:38,141 --> 02:18:39,850
the fucking wonder woman lady.
Yeah.

3027
02:18:39,851 --> 02:18:43,240
Wonder woman,
wonder woman,

3028
02:18:43,241 --> 02:18:44,074
you fucking fake from an iphone.
It's just funny because look at the 

3029
02:18:46,931 --> 02:18:47,764
picture.

3030
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:51,820
She blocked you.
Not only did she blocked me,

3031
02:18:51,821 --> 02:18:52,654
but way since then has tweeted all they 
deleted like her latest tweets and 

3032
02:18:57,641 --> 02:18:58,474
repost them from an android phone and 
she's tweeted from android phone ever 

3033
02:19:00,521 --> 02:19:01,720
since.
I'll give her respect for that.

3034
02:19:02,430 --> 02:19:04,960
They probably told you lose all that 
cash.

3035
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:07,060
There's no way she's tweeting.
Like she has a team.

3036
02:19:07,090 --> 02:19:07,923
I get it.
But like whoever was on her team 

3037
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:13,030
tweeting from an iphone,
like the fact that she blocked you,

3038
02:19:13,031 --> 02:19:14,530
those,
those hilarious.

3039
02:19:14,531 --> 02:19:16,300
It's gross.
I thought it was.

3040
02:19:16,530 --> 02:19:17,850
Do anything.
No,

3041
02:19:17,860 --> 02:19:18,671
I didn't.
I think,

3042
02:19:18,671 --> 02:19:22,480
well I tagged her in and she probably 
was just getting barraged by like people

3043
02:19:22,481 --> 02:19:24,940
going,
well you're using an APP like an iphone.

3044
02:19:24,941 --> 02:19:25,774
Like why I'm I think event.
It was like a year later she unblocked 

3045
02:19:28,611 --> 02:19:29,444
me.
It was really funny.

3046
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:31,800
She unblocked me.
Thanks.

3047
02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:33,300
That's great.
Well,

3048
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:34,700
I really love her as wonder woman.

3049
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:37,460
And my friend Patty is actually 
directing that movie director.

3050
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:39,400
The first one she's directing the second
one too.

3051
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:40,570
So she says,
gals,

3052
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:42,110
a great gal.
Tell Gal I said,

3053
02:19:42,111 --> 02:19:43,490
hi Gal.
It's okay.

3054
02:19:43,491 --> 02:19:45,080
You got busted.
That's all going to happen.

3055
02:19:45,081 --> 02:19:46,970
You're not alone.
You're a 100 percent.

3056
02:19:46,971 --> 02:19:48,680
Not a lot.
That happened recently.

3057
02:19:48,681 --> 02:19:49,514
Um,
razor the company who made that a razor 

3058
02:19:52,521 --> 02:19:57,521
phone tweeted their official 
announcement tweet of the razor phone to

3059
02:19:57,860 --> 02:19:58,693
from an iphone.
How they speakers were excellent in the 

3060
02:20:03,891 --> 02:20:04,724
first one there.
Even better or they're better than the 

3061
02:20:05,961 --> 02:20:06,590
second one.
Yeah.

3062
02:20:06,590 --> 02:20:09,770
And the better.
The second one has ip 68 or 67?

3063
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:10,683
[inaudible] 67.
I'm pretty sure it's water resistant up 

3064
02:20:13,611 --> 02:20:15,590
to 30 minutes.
One meter,

3065
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:18,050
something like that.
You can splash it.

3066
02:20:18,051 --> 02:20:19,820
I wouldn't go under water with a splash 
it,

3067
02:20:19,821 --> 02:20:22,010
but 68 is pretty,
pretty damn good.

3068
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:22,963
Yeah.
Sixty eight is the new iphone at 68 is 

3069
02:20:24,441 --> 02:20:25,274
also the note.

3070
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:27,080
Yes.
Both are 68.

3071
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:29,330
Ten Rs.
Sixty seven.

3072
02:20:29,570 --> 02:20:32,810
P three,
pixel three is 68.

3073
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:33,703
I think also.
But the weird thing about Ip 

3074
02:20:35,271 --> 02:20:38,630
certification is it's just as far as I 
know,

3075
02:20:38,631 --> 02:20:39,464
the way it works is you just submit the 
phone for a certain test and if it 

3076
02:20:42,951 --> 02:20:45,080
passes then you get to say it's 
certified.

3077
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:49,460
And the only difference between Ip 67 
and [inaudible] 68 is ip.

3078
02:20:49,461 --> 02:20:53,450
60 seven is technically certified for 30
minutes.

3079
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:58,340
One meter an IP 68 is certified for 30 
minutes,

3080
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:03,400
one point five meters and the meter.
So sometimes it's two meters,

3081
02:21:04,191 --> 02:21:07,220
sometimes it's a little more,
but it's basically just a measurement of

3082
02:21:07,221 --> 02:21:08,560
water pressure.
Like if you.

3083
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:09,583
There's different half a meter.
I mean water's heavy but like it didn't 

3084
02:21:13,461 --> 02:21:15,920
seem that significant to me,
but it's basically just water pressure.

3085
02:21:15,921 --> 02:21:17,780
So he splashed the phone a little 
harder.

3086
02:21:17,781 --> 02:21:20,210
Is it going to break versus an ip?

3087
02:21:20,210 --> 02:21:21,650
60 eight phone.
I don't know,

3088
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:22,633
just seems safe to Ip 68 every time,
but it must be a big enough difference 

3089
02:21:25,491 --> 02:21:27,660
that some of them do it.
Yeah.

3090
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:28,940
Yeah.
Interesting.

3091
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:30,860
Yeah.
Well listen man,

3092
02:21:30,990 --> 02:21:32,810
I'm glad we finally get a chance to do 
this.

3093
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:33,970
It's really cool.
A lot of fun.

3094
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:36,920
Giant fan of your videos and I really 
did.

3095
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:38,330

like I said at the beginning,

3096
02:21:38,331 --> 02:21:41,750
I really do go you immediately.
I think you do a fantastic job.

3097
02:21:41,930 --> 02:21:43,790
You cover all the bases,
you do a great job.

3098
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:44,810
Awesome.
Awesome.

3099
02:21:45,230 --> 02:21:47,010
Keep it up that for sure.
