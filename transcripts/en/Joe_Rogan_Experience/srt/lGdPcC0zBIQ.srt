1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,390
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,890
two,
one.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,030
Boom.
And we're live.

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,470
Gentlemen.
Sam Majid.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,400
How are you?
Good.

6
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:09,240
Thanks.
Pleasure to meet you.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,460
Pleasure Joe for coming here.
Yeah,

8
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm very happy to get you guys together.
I mean that was,

9
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,561
I've been kind of looking at to do this 
for at least two years and finally it's 

10
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:19,350
arrived.
What's been your ultimate goal?

11
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,790
Like what was it?
Well,

12
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:25,791
he been.
Module is just a superstar that needs 

13
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:25,791
more exposure.
I mean,

14
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:30,411
he's like,
like he should be running half of 

15
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:30,411
civilization.
I mean he's,

16
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:32,910
he's really fantastically ethical.
You can put it in the back of a book,

17
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:33,660
isn't it?
Yeah.

18
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,240
But you should.
Shouldn't put that one.

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,590
Has to be in the back of the book for 
sure.

20
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,780
Definitely not in the front.
People will read it and go,

21
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:44,781
superstar of.
I can't blow up the book we wrote 

22
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:44,781
together unfortunately.
So yeah,

23
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,740
that is an issue to kind sam.

24
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,090
Thank you very generously.
Um,

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,530
are you,
are you,

26
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,310
are you suing the southern Poverty Law 
Center?

27
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,700
Is that what's going on?
Yeah,

28
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,290
in fact,
have an update for everybody because we 

29
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,421
crowd funded a lot of the early costs 
for the case against the southern 

30
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:02,820
poverty law center.
What did they do?

31
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,650
What does it,
what does it make that comment please?

32
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,050
Once upon a time,
yours truly,

33
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,070
a British Muslim of Pakistani origin was
listed in the United Kingdom on the 

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,260
Thomson Reuters well-check database 
under a category red terrorism 

35
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,130
designation while at the same time being
listed across the Atlantic in the United

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,930
States by the southern poverty law 
center as an anti Muslim extremists.

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,960
So I was both a Muslim terrorists and an
anti Muslim extremist according to two 

38
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:40,770
separate lists and of course that speaks
to some of the polarization in our times

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,040
in how irrational this conversation 
around extreme Islam,

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,290
Islam integration,
Muslims in the West has become.

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,810
I sued Thomson Reuters.
Well,

42
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,390
check the database.
This database is no joke,

43
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:56,391
it's like HSBC and and many,
many other banks use this database for 

44
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,310
background checks on where the clients 
can have a bank account with them.

45
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,840
So as a result of,
for example,

46
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,680
Thomson Reuters in their database,
Quilliam,

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,990
which is a counter extremism 
organization I founded 10 years ago,

48
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,410
had his bank accounts shut down in the 
United States because of the Thomson 

49
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,000
Reuters wild check database system that 
HSBC subscribes to.

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,680
Anyway,
we sued them.

51
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,100
They paid damages,
they issued an apology and they,

52
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,170
uh,
took my name off this terrorism 

53
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,400
designation list they have on their well
check database module.

54
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:28,950
I think maybe you should back up further
and just give your,

55
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,050
kind of your short form bio in terms of,
well why would you ever be on a 

56
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,400
terrorist watch list?
I'll do that.

57
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,990
Um,
but at the same time,

58
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,700
the southern poverty law center had 
listed me,

59
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,930
as I said,
as an anti Muslim extremist.

60
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,580
So we are also,
uh,

61
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,200
taking legal action against them.
And um,

62
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,420
I,
I will get to your point,

63
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:50,421
but I think just want to say that the.
I've just held the law firm on retainer 

64
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:55,180
lock and they were the ones that sued 
the Rolling Stone magazine for that 

65
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,840
college rape scandal.
Yep,

66
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,770
that's right.
Successfully got won that case.

67
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Claire Lock,
which is an announcement made here 

68
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:03,820
exclusively with you.
No one else knows this yet.

69
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,940
We have retained Claire Lock.
They are writing to the southern poverty

70
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:09,120
law center as we speak.
Um,

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,220
I think they've got wind of it,
the southern poverty law center as of I 

72
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,220
think either yesterday or the day 
before,

73
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,110
they've removed the entire list that's 
been up there for two years.

74
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,700
They've removed the entire list,
which also had Ayaan Hirsi Ali on it and

75
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,260
it's no longer available on their 
website.

76
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,950
Now,
is there logic that if you're a critic 

77
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,280
of Islam,
a radical fundamentalist Islam that you 

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,760
are somehow or another or racist 
extremist?

79
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,210
So that's pretty much what they've said.
If you criticize Islam ion myself who 

80
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:44,751
have come from within the community and 
you've had that experience that somehow 

81
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:48,121
that makes us anti Muslim,
there are a number of logical areas 

82
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:50,500
involved in that logical leap that 
they've made.

83
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,530
Do they have any distinction or is there
anything that they write that sort of 

84
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,770
points to why they would say that?
Uh,

85
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,090
one of them,
honestly,

86
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:03,091
the reasons they listed,
one of them was that I had a bachelor 

87
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:03,100
party in a strip club a year before I 
got married.

88
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,460
That makes you an anti Muslim 
extremists.

89
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:09,860
That was one of the reasons listed.
Oh,

90
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,490
nine slash 11 hijackers,
hijackers were they really listed that I

91
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:23,071
actually listed that,
which is part of the reason why we can 

92
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:23,950
prove malice because what has that got 
to do with anything but that doesn't.

93
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,720
Yeah,
that doesn't make any sense.

94
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,470
Yeah.
So that was,

95
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,500
that was a primary reason.
It was one of the three main reasons 

96
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,230
that you listed.
And another one was again,

97
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,280
false.
Uh,

98
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,520
they claimed that I had called for the 
criminalization of the face veil for 

99
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,910
Muslim women in the West,
which wasn't true.

100
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,940
I had called for a policy to be adopted 
were in banks and airports where you're 

101
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,100
not allowed to wear a motorcycle helmet.
You also shouldn't be allowed to cover 

102
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,170
your face,
a face in the name of religion,

103
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,080
which is very different according to the
criminalization,

104
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:56,140
per se of the face veil.
That's like saying you're not allowed to

105
00:04:56,141 --> 00:05:01,141
wear a motorcycle helmet and the bank.
So I believe in the criminalization of 

106
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:01,141
motorcycle helmets.
It's just absurd.

107
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:06,030
It's ridiculous.
So it was a mischaracterization of my 

108
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,030
opinion.
The artist to.

109
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,820
Yep.
And the other one,

110
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,290
uh,
the,

111
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,400
the reason they don't even read because 
they kept changing their reasons at the 

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,550
actual website has been,
um,

113
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,240
we've got the archive and it's been,
they've been changing it each time.

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,970
People have been pointing out the 
stupidity of their allegations.

115
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,060
So why do they exist?
What is the southern poverty law 

116
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,060
center's.
I mean,

117
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,720
this is a painful irony because if you 
roll back the clock now,

118
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:30,721
you know,
20 or some odd years there reasons to 

119
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:33,931
exist were great.
I mean this was the flagship 

120
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:37,381
organization that was suing the KKK and 
sovereign citizens and just the,

121
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:42,571
the far right white nationalists,
Christian nationalist movements in the 

122
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:45,790
US and in some cases to great effect.
And their,

123
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,791
and their concern obviously about 
extremists hate groups in the US was 

124
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,620
totally valid.
And I mean,

125
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,450
it was,
it became,

126
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,290
I mean,
now,

127
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,310
now that we will see how morally

128
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,310
confused they are,
people who have been shining a light on 

129
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,310
them and they,
they've,

130
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,240
they're this bloated organization that's
been taken way too much money and there,

131
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,090
I mean,
it's not,

132
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,130
it,
it suffers from other signs of,

133
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,620
of corruption or conflicts of interest.
But back in the day,

134
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,090
you know,
Morris dees was bringing the KKK to 

135
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,590
court and bankrupt in their various 
chapters and that,

136
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,210
that looked fantastic.
And now the social justice warrior moral

137
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:28,211
panic,
moral stupidity virus has gotten into 

138
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:32,291
their brains and they can't 
differentiate someone like Majid from a 

139
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:37,601
right wing Christian,
Neo Nazi hater of Islam,

140
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,960
right?
Or hater of,

141
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,120
of,
of people from the Middle East.

142
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,610
Uh,
and,

143
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,850
and so it is with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and 
have a.

144
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,250
now,
ironically,

145
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,050
you're off the website.
Now I'm on it.

146
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,240
I think I'm on it in a far more 
transitory way.

147
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:55,241
But the article that was written about 
my podcast with Charles Murray by vox 

148
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,910
hit the southern poverty law center hate
watch page.

149
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:02,420
And so there you had articles about Neo 
Nazi groups,

150
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,800
articles about the Austin bomber,
and then me and,

151
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,320
and my podcast with Charles Murray.
I definitely want to talk about that,

152
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,960
but I want to give people your 
background first,

153
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:15,350
the reason why you were on the list in 
the UK and in the first year

154
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,090
he's had to do with your actual 
background.

155
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,930
So I was born and raised in Essex in the
United Kingdom.

156
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,410
And I came of age in what I now refer to
as the battle days of racism in the 

157
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,360
United Kingdom.
Much has changed since then for the 

158
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,880
good.
But in those days there were a serious,

159
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,840
uh,
cases of violent racism that I've faced.

160
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,830
A hammer attacks,
machete attacks by actual neonazis.

161
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,590
I mean,
I've grown up.

162
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,840
This is the irony of this southern 
poverty law center listing.

163
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:48,170
I've grown up fighting neo Nazis on the 
streets and they've been attacking me 

164
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,990
with hammers and machetes because of the
color of my skin.

165
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
And you've got a bunch of white guys in 
Alabama,

166
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,440
a designating me in the same breath as 
they would designate,

167
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,480
designate these neo Nazis.
But that when I grew up in having that 

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,180
experience being falsely arrested by 
Essex police on a number of occasions,

169
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:07,290
profiled while the genocide in Bosnia 
was unfolding against Muslims in Bosnia,

170
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,890
I often say to an American audience,
when I'm speaking about this,

171
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:15,891
we all now here with you on the West 
Coast in this beautiful new studio you 

172
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:17,670
have,
congratulations and imagine the genocide

173
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:22,671
was unfolding on the east coast against 
a group of people with whom you 

174
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,540
identified and even if it's just on a 
human level,

175
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,600
human beings,
but you know,

176
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,860
even within a community identification 
would impact you in a way.

177
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,040
For example,
if you define yourself as a Jewish and 

178
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,420
there was a genocide against Jews on the
other side of this continent,

179
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,850
of this very country,
how it would impact you on,

180
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,830
on the west coast.
Well,

181
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,060
sorry over,
sorry.

182
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:42,840
Eva.
From London,

183
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,560
it takes us less time to fly from London
to Bosnia than it does from New York to 

184
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,160
La.
And so it really had a profound impact 

185
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,741
on Muslims across Europe when that 
genocide was unfolding and things were 

186
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:55,050
never the same again.
It radicalize an entire generation,

187
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,370
of course,
ideology

188
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,370
had a lot to do with that,
but the anger originally came from the 

189
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:01,770
genocide.
So at the age of 16,

190
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,890
what with the domestic racism and the 
situation in Bosnia unfolding as it did,

191
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,220
I joined his battalion,
which is a,

192
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,640
uh,
a non terrorist still legal in America 

193
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
and in Britain and across Europe,
a Islamist organization.

194
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,700
It was the first of the global Islamist 
organizations that aspire to resurrect 

195
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,860
the notion of a caliphate,
a which we've subsequently seen to great

196
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:27,900
damaging effect in the form of Isis 
Caliphate.

197
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,560
And,
uh,

198
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,580
the method of coming to power.
It was by infiltrating militaries in 

199
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,250
Muslim majority countries,
uh,

200
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,070
recruiting army officers and then 
instigating military coups,

201
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,340
whether that be in Turkey and Pakistan 
and Egypt.

202
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,380
These are the countries they,
they targeted and their aim would be to 

203
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,590
them through the military coup,
set up this caliphate,

204
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:49,020
which would then be an expansionist 
caliphate.

205
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,760
Uh,
and we'll conquer the world.

206
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,270
I mean,
that's,

207
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,340
it sounds crazy.
That's what they believe.

208
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,370
And that's what they're very,
very serious and intent on bringing 

209
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:58,370
about.
And now people,

210
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,020
when I say that,
believe me because they've seen the isis

211
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:06,021
experiment unfold,
but I joined a group that sought to do 

212
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:06,021
that.
Um,

213
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:08,580
through non terroristic means are the 
age of 16.

214
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,030
I ended,
ended up on the leadership of that 

215
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,030
organization in the UK.
UH,

216
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,500
ended up co founding that group in 
Pakistan in 1999 where I went,

217
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,150
I left the UK,
went to Pakistan,

218
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,080
was among the first,
the vanguard of British Pakistani 

219
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,080
members that went out there to set the 
group up.

220
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,300
Uh,
they've been about three or four a 

221
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,460
cupelets in Pakistan since an army 
officers had been arrested for being 

222
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,430
members of this group and many of them 
still in jail.

223
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,360
I spent a year in Pakistan,
went back while studying for my degree 

224
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,450
in the University of London,
would fly Monday,

225
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,930
would fly on Saturdays and Sundays to 
Copenhagen in Denmark.

226
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,810
I cofounded the Danish Pakistani chapter
of this group.

227
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,350
And then the third year of my degree 
because I was doing law and Arabic,

228
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,080
uh,
resulted in me having to go to an Arab 

229
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,410
country for the language you.
And so I chose Egypt.

230
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,270
And,
uh,

231
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,210
a day before the nine slash 11 attacks 
in 2001 I ended up in Egypt.

232
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,450
I went to Alexandria,
enrolled in the University of Alexandria

233
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,330
to study for the year of Arabic 
language,

234
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,550
which was a third year of my degree.
Um,

235
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,000
of course nine slash 11 happened.
And the climate changed.

236
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,070
The security climate change all over the
world.

237
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,020
Something we didn't know about nor 
predicted.

238
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,390
And on the first of April,
2002,

239
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,510
my house in Alexandria was rated by the 
Egyptian state security.

240
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,330
I was blindfolded.
My hands were tied behind my back.

241
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,730
I was then driven through the desert 
into Cairo,

242
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,590
to the dungeon of the state security 
headquarters in a building known as a,

243
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,680
as a LG has,
which is the main headquarters of an 

244
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:39,680
adult.

245
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,450
This internal state security.
We were held in the dungeons there for 

246
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,960
four days and they electrocuted most of 
the prisoners that they had.

247
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,270
They're tortured them interrogate to 
them.

248
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,870
On the fourth day,
I was taken to a prison,

249
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:56,871
known as muzzled Artora in Cairo,
put into solitary confinement for about 

250
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,770
three and a half months.
Then charged,

251
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,830
eventually sentenced to five years as a 
political prisoner under the Egyptian 

252
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,310
emergency law.
Um,

253
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,680
and serve my full sentence there in 
Egypt,

254
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,210
uh,
eventually left prison in 2006 and 

255
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,210
returned to the UK.
So,

256
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,980
so did,
did Amnesty International gets you out 

257
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,380
at all or they know they only can 
interest in paying for my release.

258
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,650
Nobody got me out because that's a 
finished my full prison sentence.

259
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,030
Um,
but what changed me and led to me to be 

260
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,210
the man that sits before you today is,
you're right,

261
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:35,420
Sam Amnesty's adoption of me and,
and,

262
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,720
and a few others in the case as 
prisoners of conscience.

263
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,420
And they took the very brave and bold 
step.

264
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,590
Now looking back at it,
because keep in mind the context here.

265
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,610
This is Bush was president.
Tony Blair was prime minister and we 

266
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,600
were in the thick of the war on terror.
We were in the middle of it and um,

267
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,140
I'm gonna see comes along and says we 
disagree with everything this guy stands

268
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,420
for,
but they don't believe in using violence

269
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:59,110
to bring their caliphate about.
And so we will defend their right to say

270
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,000
stupid things and they shouldn't be in 
prison,

271
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:02,440
they certainly shouldn't have been 
tortured for it.

272
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,100
So I'm amnesty adopted us as prisoners 
of conscience and I was 24 years old at 

273
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,100
the time,
by the way.

274
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,931
So everything I've just described to you
happened to me up until the age of 24 

275
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:15,691
when I was in prison.
And it was the first time in my 

276
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:17,130
relatively young life from 40 now,
right.

277
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,630
And,
uh,

278
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,100
I had never been defended by any 
mainstream pillar of mainstream society 

279
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,730
in that way before.
Nobody had spoken out for me.

280
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,970
And that had a,
a real huge kind of emotional impact on 

281
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,460
my psyche.
Um,

282
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,570
I've said in my autobiography that where
the hot leads,

283
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:39,571
the mind can follow.
And so I was now willing to consider 

284
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:40,480
alternatives because of amnesties work 
campaigning for me.

285
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,700
And so I spent the next four years in 
prison,

286
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,990
uh,
reading,

287
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,810
rereading Orwell,
uh,

288
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,700
every one of his books,
reading Tolkien,

289
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:51,700
reading classic English literature,
studying Islamic theology,

290
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,000
really trying to understand the world 
around me.

291
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,620
Um,
and I had four years to do so.

292
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,170
And I spent four years debating and 
discussing with,

293
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,650
um,
pretty much the founders of Egypt's 

294
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,691
manger,
hottest organizations who are in jail 

295
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:09,000
with me in the same prison,
including the assassins or the former 

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
president,
Anwar Sadat,

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,870
who had been killed in 1981 because of 
his peace deal with Israel and his 

298
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,771
assassins were in jail with me and 
they'd been in prison longer than I've 

299
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:16,771
been alive.

300
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:20,490
And so they had some collective years of
wisdom between them and most of those 

301
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:20,490
jihadis,
prisoners I was in jail with,

302
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,470
had over the course of those years to 
decades and more change their views and 

303
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,540
reformed.
They will still conservative religious 

304
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:30,610
Muslims something which I'm not.
Um,

305
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,230
and I never,
I don't claim to be in my,

306
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,120
in my work at the moment,
um,

307
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,180
but they were still religious Muslims,
but there were no longer a extremists 

308
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,940
and they were no longer what I call 
Islamists.

309
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,880
People that sought to implement their 
version of Islam over society.

310
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,390
And so they are in four years of 
constant debate and discussion with 

311
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:53,461
them.
People that I knew had more wisdom than 

312
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:53,461
me.
They'd been

313
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:55,940
in jail for longer than I've been alive.
I my views began slowly changing.

314
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I read a lot of the books they wrote 
about changing their own views and why 

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,791
they changed and upon my release I,
I eventually a good few months after my 

316
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:09,701
release,
I had to leave the organization because 

317
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,580
I no longer believed in an ideology that
I was prepared to die for.

318
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
That is fascinating that the shift came 
about in jail.

319
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,910
Speaking with assassin's among many 
others.

320
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,430
Yeah.
That.

321
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,810
That is really incredible.
You would think that most people think 

322
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,331
that when someone goes to jail usually 
whatever criminality that they have in 

323
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:26,870
them as segmented and hardened.
Yeah.

324
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,340
I'm.
I don't know why mine is an exceptional 

325
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:32,340
case because most people,
you're right.

326
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,791
Whether you look at say cotto who's 
known as the founding father of modern 

327
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,130
day jihadism,
he started off like me,

328
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,010
a non terrorist Islamist,
but in Egypt's jails.

329
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,510
In fact,
the very gentle I was held in,

330
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:46,511
he was tortured and he ended up becoming
the godfather of modern day terrorism 

331
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:49,820
through his book milestones or Marlin,
three in Arabic,

332
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,660
and yet that in my case,
for whatever reason,

333
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,400
I kind of went that bit further to 
question everything I believed in,

334
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,660
but that's not normal in most cases.
When you torture people in jail,

335
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,690
it ends up hardening and ossifying that 
ideology and people become as angry as 

336
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,460
you know,
they become the monster that they were 

337
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,460
seeking to defeat.
So you get out of jail,

338
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,650
what do you do then?
So I left the group in 2007 and by 2008 

339
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,800
in January.
So I finished my degree.

340
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,510
I had one year left of my undergraduate 
degree.

341
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,350
I graduated,
I did my masters at the London School of

342
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,350
Economics and political theory and while
doing the master's setup Quilliam and 

343
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,350
Quilliam,
we,

344
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,500
we bill as the world's first counter 
extremism organization.

345
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,070
It was meant to be,
we believe it is bringing us back to the

346
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:38,150
SPLC,
his allegation,

347
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,480
a Muslim response to extremism from 
people that have lived it and been 

348
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,560
through it.
Um,

349
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,780
my co founders were,
isn't mrs themselves who changed like 

350
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:48,780
me,
uh,

351
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,340
Muslims born and raised,
uh,

352
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,330
come from the community to have a 
community based response,

353
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,990
a Muslim response to this growing 
problem of extremism.

354
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,390
And this was 10 years ago and Isis 
emerged since then,

355
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,090
only demonstrating why this kind of 
response was needed.

356
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,330
And so for the southern poverty law 
center to designate somebody with my 

357
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:07,330
background,
with that trajectory,

358
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,230
with somebody who was prepared to die 
for this cause.

359
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,170
And so somebody who wanted to address 
these problems as a Muslim to call for 

360
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:19,970
reform for the good of my communities as
opposed to against them,

361
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,020
you know,
at the end of the day it can only 

362
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,020
benefit Muslim communities of extremism 
is put back in its box.

363
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,870
Um,
for them to then list someone like me as

364
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:29,990
an anti Muslim extremists.
It just really does shine a light on the

365
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:34,991
truth,
certainty of the situation we find 

366
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:37,241
ourselves in absurdity.
And the lack of real investigation or 

367
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,920
backing up their claims with actual 
facts and information.

368
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:47,921
And that brings me to your story with 
Charles Murray and vox and Ezra Klein 

369
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:50,250
was linger here for a moment that it's 
the same problem,

370
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,680
but not only is it a lack of 
investigation,

371
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:57,681
but when it gets pointed out,
and I forgot the guy's name at the SPLC 

372
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:59,340
who was quarterback in this,
but it wasn't more as ds,

373
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:04,341
but it was someone high up mark,
the poetic or the CEO of something coed 

374
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,010
I think is the.
Yeah,

375
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,550
I thought it was mark.
Anyways,

376
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,570
he's listed in the.
He's named in the Atlantic article that 

377
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,010
first put this on our radar,
but he.

378
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,610
They just doubled down.
I mean the,

379
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:15,870
the,
the,

380
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:20,871
the error cannot be pointed out clearly 
enough to trigger and much less than 

381
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,440
apology,
a,

382
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,440
any modulation of the claim.
They just.

383
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:30,210
People just doubled down in the face of 
obvious counter evidence and that's,

384
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,130
it's just not about a sincere engagement
with the problem.

385
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:40,131
And there's.
And there's this and there's so many 

386
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:40,680
variables here that make it make it a 
really toxic environment.

387
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,830
But one is that the,
the,

388
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:47,040
the locus of concern is never the 
individual.

389
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,020
It is the group is the tribe and so you 
can.

390
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,160
It's like they'll sacrifice any number 
of individuals to make the political 

391
00:18:55,321 --> 00:19:00,321
case.
They want to make a so they don't 

392
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:01,080
completely unrepentant when they're 
shown to get it wrong.

393
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:06,081
And so in your case and an ions case,
it's just such a such a grievous moral 

394
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:10,950
lapse because not only is it is the 
attack on you illegitimate,

395
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,480
it actually raises your,
your security concerns and it it.

396
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,260
It becomes a reference point for 
journalists who are confused,

397
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,710
who can't follow the plot or don't have 
the time to,

398
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,840
to fact check everything.
It makes you radioactive from the point 

399
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,221
of view of mainstream journalists 
because either they go to the southern 

400
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,980
poverty law center site to figure out 
who's worth talking to and they see a 

401
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,591
page where you're listed as a anti 
Muslim extremist along with people who 

402
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,150
bear very little resemblance to you 
ideologically.

403
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:45,570
Because there's probably a few people on
there who who could be described as anti

404
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:50,571
Muslim extremists.
And here are the 10 people you don't 

405
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:54,921
need to talk to about this problem,
whereas you're actually one of the most 

406
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:59,001
valuable voices.
I mean objectively one of the most 

407
00:19:59,001 --> 00:19:59,040
valuable voices,
but probably,

408
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,020
you know,
I can probably count on two fingers,

409
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,350
you know,
anyone who would rival your voice on 

410
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,350
this topic.
Uh,

411
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,350
so it's,
it's just mind boggling.

412
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,750
It's very difficult trying to keep this 
my closest.

413
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,730
Yeah.
It's very difficult.

414
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:14,731
You can swing it towards.
You can tweak it to say it's very 

415
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:14,731
difficult because,
um,

416
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,780
icon can't.
I can't fully explain to anybody what it

417
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:21,781
feels like to have lived an entire life 
from roughly the age of 14 being 

418
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:25,300
consumed by this issue of Muslims in the
west and this question.

419
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,240
And originally getting it,
answering it in one way,

420
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,840
and then still being consumed by the 
topic,

421
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,070
answering it in a different way.
As I now do,

422
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,760
I can't describe to anybody how much 
emotionally the toll that it takes to 

423
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:44,461
have your whole life have defined your 
whole life by trying to answer this 

424
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:48,100
question and because you for it.
Because

425
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,160
this is a question that concerns you 
when I joined these limits group,

426
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:56,161
I did.
I was wrong and adopted some really 

427
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:59,371
nefarious ideas,
but did so because I gave a damn and 

428
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:02,911
cared for a genocide that I saw 
unfolding and desperately wanted a 

429
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:04,390
solution.
So even when I became an Islamist,

430
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:09,391
I did so out of care and love and 
concern for what I believed was my 

431
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:13,711
community under attack.
So to have a bunch of people come along 

432
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:17,370
and say that I am anti the very 
community that I've believer of.

433
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,270
I have fought for all my life,
you know,

434
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,420
and have and my life has been consumed 
and defined by this.

435
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,750
It really is taking the one thing away 
from somebody that they have.

436
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,880
I mean,
I went to jail for this thing.

437
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:35,881
I have people have died in front of my 
eyes from the torture wounds in prison 

438
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:35,881
because of this thing.

439
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,900
To have someone completely ignorant in 
that way,

440
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,090
to,
to deprive me of having the,

441
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,930
of being able to claim that I have stood
for my community.

442
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,560
But by instead saying that I'm anti that
community,

443
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:50,230
it really does kind of make you feel 
like crap.

444
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,560
Jo,
when did this start happening?

445
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,710
This moral panic that you've constantly 
discussed in these flippant sort of 

446
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,391
accusations without real.
Any real solid objective reasoning 

447
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,110
behind calling someone like you or Ion 
Hirsi Ali,

448
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:13,111
who's the victim of female genital 
mutilation to say that she's an anti 

449
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:15,280
Muslim,
that she's Islamophobic is.

450
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,490
It seems to me it's almost insane,
but it seems to me to be prevalent.

451
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,720
This is something that is a common 
sentiment today that I don't recall ever

452
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,270
seeing anything like this one or two 
decades ago.

453
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,700
Yeah.
We might have a better sense than I do,

454
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:37,701
but I don't.
It's become increasingly salient to me 

455
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:42,111
just because I've been doing this work 
for better or worse and colliding with 

456
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:42,840
these people more and more.
But,

457
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,620
uh,
it's,

458
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,740
it's definitely an export from some 
trends in intellectual life that go back

459
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,590
50 years or more.
I mean,

460
00:22:52,591 --> 00:22:53,110
they always,
oh,

461
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:56,360
what postmodernism did,
and I mean,

462
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,070
you can go back further than that.
It's just there.

463
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,360
There's a,
there's a,

464
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:05,660
a framework,
a kind of pseudo intellectual framework 

465
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,790
where facts can't be talked about as 
facts.

466
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,860
They're,
they're intrinsically political.

467
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,220
They intrinsically convey power 
disparities.

468
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,380
Um,
you know,

469
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,060
science is just a tool of power sort of 
thinking,

470
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:20,790
and this goes back a ways,
but it is,

471
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,910
it's now seemingly ascendant on the left
in a way that is,

472
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,640
is just fairly bewildering amount.
It seems to be only two subjects.

473
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,550
Gender and race.
Those are the ones that get.

474
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,200
Those are the big ones.
I think it's,

475
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm sure we could find more if we take a
minute to think about it,

476
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:38,040
but there are,
those are,

477
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,850
those are,
those certainly dwarf every other.

478
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,890
Those are the ones where there's a wall,
there's a wall that you can't get 

479
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:46,890
through with reason

480
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,970
that this isn't quite raised.
This is the way it's drawn.

481
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,000
A lot of energy from concerns about 
racism.

482
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,520
Identity.
It is.

483
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,320
The perception is that Muslims are a 
politically beleaguered minority that 

484
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,640
have to be.
So it is like,

485
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:06,070
it is a great.
I mean people think there's,

486
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,910
you know,
it's racist to criticize Islam.

487
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,080
Has that made any sense?
I mean,

488
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,500
you know,
Ben Affleck being one,

489
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,780
but it is,
you know,

490
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:17,180
this is their minority in Los Angeles.
They're not a minute.

491
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,500
The second biggest religion on earth 
this is we're talking about one point 7 

492
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,930
billion people in there and the 
criticism of Muslim extremism for the 

493
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,161
most part is focused on societies where 
you have most cases,

494
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:34,280
a majority Muslim population,
you have women and gays and,

495
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,190
and freethinkers treated terribly.
And that's,

496
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:38,060
that.
That is the,

497
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,860
you know,
the center of the Bullseye in terms of,

498
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,260
you know,
what,

499
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,940
what one is criticizing when one talks 
about the accuracy.

500
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,120
So I,
that there was a lot of this stuff.

501
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:49,700
There's some,
this paranoia,

502
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:54,701
this son of a irrational approach,
this conversation that Sam suffered from

503
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,530
and when,
when,

504
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,270
when I first met him,
uh,

505
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,460
I Miss New York at the intelligence 
squared debate that heat that.

506
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,610
So Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Douglas Murray,
who I believe you've had.

507
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,940
Yes.
On this podcast,

508
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:12,941
we're on one side of a debate.
I was on the other side of this debate 

509
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:14,780
and the motion that we were debating was
Islam is a religion of peace.

510
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,830
I was back then arguing,
well,

511
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,870
half of my true belief is because I 
actually don't believe it's a religion 

512
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,910
of peace or war,
it's just a religion that is interpreted

513
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:26,810
in different ways,
but I had to pick a side and so I picked

514
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,280
that side in defending the motion and an
a on an will on the other side.

515
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,490
And there was a,
there was a dinner afterwards for the 

516
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:36,810
speakers and Sam was there.
And imagine you were there as a guest.

517
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,920
Yeah.
Um,

518
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,260
and so it's my,
well,

519
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,810
I didn't know who he was at a,
on an I were locked in conversation,

520
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,720
post debate conversation and uh,
uh,

521
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,690
ion invited Samhsa to have his say and 
she said,

522
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:52,310
I want to hear what Sam Harris has to 
say.

523
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,300
And so

524
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,680
context is relevant.
So we're at.

525
00:25:55,681 --> 00:26:00,681
So we had a public,
he's seen these intelligence squared 

526
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:01,110
debates that are there,
very well produced online.

527
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:02,520
I don't know that they're televised 
anymore,

528
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,750
but they're online.
They're,

529
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,850
they get a great theater in Manhattan 
and you know,

530
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,610
as an audience,
maybe a thousand people and,

531
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,750
and John Donvan the journalist is the 
impresario.

532
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,220
And,
but then this was a dinner afterwards,

533
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,150
were the organizers and the participants
been there,

534
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:23,151
there may be 70 people in the back room 
of a restaurant and Majid Nih,

535
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:28,941
we're not at the same table,
thankfully we were like 50 feet away 

536
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:32,691
from each other but facing each other.
And so he was at the table with ion and 

537
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,711
the other speakers and at one point that
everyone's getting debriefed about how 

538
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:40,140
this went.
And Ion says why a Sam Harris is here.

539
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,300
I'd like to hear what he has to say 
about the debate.

540
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,440
And so I look at my budget and he's 
okay.

541
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,050
He's either at least 50 feet away from 
me and I'm a.

542
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,410
I mean,
do you want me to say what I,

543
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:55,590
you?
So I would say so he had made moves in 

544
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,510
this debate that I considered 
intellectually dishonest.

545
00:26:57,511 --> 00:26:58,320
And,
and I mean,

546
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:58,780
he,
he's,

547
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,840
he's playing a game and this is not a 
real conversation.

548
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:05,730
This is a formal academic style of 
debate where his job is not to leave his

549
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:08,730
view open to influenced by the other 
discussions.

550
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:09,930
He's,
he's making a case.

551
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,540
Um,
uh,

552
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,820
and I didn't know it at the time,
but he felt unnaturally constrained by 

553
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,550
the format of the debate.
He had to argue that Islam is a religion

554
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:21,210
of peace and some of the moves he made 
there I thought were dishonest.

555
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,660
And so I said,
I'm a mom and I remember this more or 

556
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:31,941
less verbatim because we talked about,
and we've since transcribe it into a 

557
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:31,941
book,
but,

558
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,870
um,
I said,

559
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,580
Majid know everyone in this room 
recognizes that you have the hardest job

560
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:41,070
in the world and we're all very glad 
that you're doing it.

561
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,070
You have to somehow convince the next 
generation of Muslims that Islam really 

562
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,520
is a religion of peace and the jihad is 
just an inner spiritual struggle and 

563
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,110
that it'd be martyrs don't get 72 
virgins in paradise and all the rest.

564
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,190
And so my question for you is,
is this,

565
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,060
do you really believe that,
that this is the case now?

566
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:08,061
Or do you,
do you think that pretending that is 

567
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:08,061
the,
that is the case,

568
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:12,261
is the method by which you will make it 
the case that if you just pretend long 

569
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:12,990
enough and hard enough,
it'll become so

570
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:18,130
and the extra line here was.
And can you just be honest with us in 

571
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:18,290
the privacy of my final sentence was,

572
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,850
and you know,
we're not on,

573
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,280
we're not televised now,
can you just be honest with us here?

574
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,240
And uh,

575
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,660
so,
so I responded immediately and said,

576
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:27,920
are you calling me a liar?
And

577
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,390
Seventy we now 70 people and I'm like 
into my second gin and tonic and,

578
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,320
and he's given me the sort of Middle 
Eastern stare down across.

579
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,630
You repeat today said,
no,

580
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:45,631
no,
I'm asking you just hear that where 

581
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:45,631
there's no cameras,
can you just be honest with us?

582
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:45,631
And I said,
are you calling me a liar?

583
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,590
And it didn't go too well at all.
The entire,

584
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,090
everyone on the table kind of went quiet
and I didn't know who this guy was.

585
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:55,930
I never met him and I should have known 
who he was.

586
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,560
And then I think somebody are very 
tactfully changed the conversation and 

587
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,910
just completely veered off this.
And I'd never,

588
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,460
I never spoke to them again for another,
what was it,

589
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,210
a couple of three years we'd never 
crossed paths in San.

590
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:14,211
And the reason I bring this up is that I
was one of those guys that didn't want 

591
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,520
to entertain a conversation with Sam,
uh,

592
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,280
based upon the defensiveness when it 
came to this topic.

593
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,790
And I think that actually it's important
to say that to people that because you 

594
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,060
asked him a question about the Charles 
Murray situation,

595
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,330
a lot of people,
rather than actually wanting to engage 

596
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:30,940
with someone on the substance of their 
ideas,

597
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,940
that I think in the climate we're in 
today,

598
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,890
they're engaging with people based upon 
their,

599
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,730
on their feelings.

600
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,820
And those feelings are valid.
Of course everyone has the right to 

601
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,221
their feelings.
But we've got to try as hard as we to 

602
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:44,221
detach

603
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:47,160
those feelings from because that's 
clearly not what the principle of 

604
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,250
charity means.
You lend the person that you're speaking

605
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:52,550
to the best possible interpretation of 
what they're saying and,

606
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,580
and,
and allow them to clarify what they mean

607
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:56,350
as opposed to you putting into their 
mouths what,

608
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,570
what they mean,
and telling them what they mean.

609
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,010
I learned that,
you know,

610
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,500
because then two years later he reaches 
out to me and he says,

611
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,070
I think we can try again.
Are you willing to have a conversation 

612
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,070
with me?
And,

613
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,280
and I hadn't originally remembered it 
was the same guy,

614
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,940
so that's fine.
I got my foot in the door just because 

615
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,490
you didn't know who I was.
And then we had this conversation,

616
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:17,350
which,
it's a lesson for me because we had this

617
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:18,420
conversation.
It's,

618
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,440
it's,
it's called Islam in the future of 

619
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,440
tolerance.
It's become a book right?

620
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,120
Published by Harvard University Press.
We had this conversation that became a 

621
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,420
book that been made into a film,
which I think any couple of weeks now we

622
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:30,640
hear some news on that.
It's coming up with that.

623
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,590
So we did a lecture tour of Australia 
and the people who organize that,

624
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,930
she made a documentary that we realize 
this lesson to your question and that is

625
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:45,931
that I am somebody that didn't engage 
with him on the substance of his 

626
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:50,161
question,
but actually fired a misfire and 

627
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:50,640
emotional misfire on,
on,

628
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,190
on,
on,

629
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,220
on what was really questioning his 
motives for asking the question rather 

630
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,790
than actually addressing,
addressing the points he was making.

631
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:00,640
And I think that when I,
because I didn't remember who he was,

632
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,470
I then started the conflict conversation
in new,

633
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,700
uh,
without the memory of my original 

634
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:08,700
judgment on him and the conversation 
went really well.

635
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,620
So we've got to somehow be able to 
divorce ourselves from that background.

636
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:12,700
That can happen.
I mean,

637
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:13,900
it can be done.
It's just,

638
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,080
it takes people have strong character to
try to like abandon all preconceived 

639
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,660
notions from the past conversation.
Just start fresh.

640
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,370
Yeah.
I unfortunately,

641
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:28,360
this example of,
of a kind of a signal success has,

642
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,600
has caused me to,
in the end kind of miss band a lot of 

643
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,551
energies.
There's assuming that trying to 

644
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,200
replicate it.
I keep thinking I keep walking into 

645
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,200
another situation and thinking this is 
possible.

646
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,550
Is that why you deleted twitter?
Well,

647
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:41,910
I,
yeah,

648
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,490
yes.
Um,

649
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,540
so you haven't deleted your account?
I'm still on twitter,

650
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,070
but I,
I will,

651
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,840
uh,
based on this reason episode,

652
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:54,841
I use it.
They're fascinated by people and their 

653
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:57,700
struggles with social media with like 
detaching from it,

654
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:00,820
reattaching from it,
getting addicted to it.

655
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:04,810
I mean I know so many people that will 
look at their twitter at like 1:00

656
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:09,811
in the morning before they go to bed and
something pisses them off and then they 

657
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:11,500
can't sleep really common.
I was not,

658
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,980
I don't consider myself someone who had 
a,

659
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,880
a,
a real pathology with that amount was,

660
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,080
you know,
I have,

661
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,730
I dunno,
6,000

662
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,880
tweets or 7,000
tweets over the course of many years,

663
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,430
so I'm not,
I was not tweeting that much.

664
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,220
I was not even looking that much.
I was,

665
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:34,050
I was fairly disengaged and I've never 
used facebook as a.

666
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,170
I've never,
I just use.

667
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,850
Facebook is kind of a publishing 
channel.

668
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:40,240
I never engaged with comments,
but I was looking

669
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,050
enough and it,
it was one,

670
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,860
it was clearly making me a worse person.
I mean,

671
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:46,200
I just,
it,

672
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,250
I was,
I was reacting to stuff that I didn't 

673
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,561
need to react to and it was amplified in
certain criticisms and voices which need

674
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:56,450
not have been amplified.
And in this,

675
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,540
in this last case,
it just turned a create a huge explosion

676
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,990
in my life.
I was in the middle of a vacation,

677
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:10,970
which I basically torpedoed because of 
what I saw on twitter and it was just,

678
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
it was like the perfect infomercial for 
why you don't want to be engaged with 

679
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,630
your vacation.
How while.

680
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,800
So I'm in the middle of the first 
vacation I've taken with my family for a

681
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:24,440
very long time.
It was at least a year and wow.

682
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,540
And so,
you know,

683
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:31,541
we're on Hawaii and just like I'm 
supposed to put everything down to be 

684
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:32,480
the best father and husband I can be.

685
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,920
Right.
And that was my intention.

686
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:36,200
That's what was happening.
Uh,

687
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,230
it happened for a good solid 24 hours 
and then I pick up my phone and I see 

688
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:48,461
that that raises salon and Glenn 
Greenwald and Ezra Klein had all 

689
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:51,120
attacked me in the space of an hour just
like now it's,

690
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,820
this goes out to millions of people.
He was also was asking about the Charles

691
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,460
Murray thing.
Yeah.

692
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,420
Well,
truth is,

693
00:33:56,421 --> 00:34:01,421
I can't even see what I,
I didn't look at what Greenwald had 

694
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:01,421
done.
Um,

695
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:03,320
he was circulating.
Somebody is video about me,

696
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,900
how I'm,
I think I'm a racist in that video.

697
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:11,510
Reza Aslan blocks me,
so I can't even see what if he attacks 

698
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,510
me by name,
but he blocks me so the hay,

699
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,450
so I can't even see what his export.
But uh,

700
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:16,820
so I,
but I just saw the aftermath of that,

701
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:17,720
you know,
lots of stuff.

702
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,720
Lots of notifications coming to me with 
both of us tagged.

703
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,700
And then Ezra published this.
I suppose I should back up a however 

704
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,550
painful way to describe what happened 
here.

705
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:33,551
But.
So I had Charles Murray on my podcast a 

706
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:36,130
year ago and Charles Murray's this,
this a social scientist who published 

707
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:41,130
the bell curve back in the nineties,
which was a book about Iq and,

708
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,480
and success in,
in western societies like our own.

709
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,440
And uh,
uh,

710
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,750
it's a book where he worries a lot about
the cognitive stratification of society.

711
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:55,751
We have a society that is selecting more
and more for a narrow band of talents 

712
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:58,880
that are fairly well captured by what we
call Iq.

713
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,930
And there is a kind of winner take all 
situation where people are really,

714
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,910
you know,
500 years ago,

715
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:08,060
if you had a,
a very high Iq and you're,

716
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,130
you're just pushing a plow next to your 
neighbor.

717
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,130
You had no real advantage.
But now you can start a hedge fund or 

718
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:15,590
you can start a software company.
And we're,

719
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:19,730
we're seeing this real shocking 
disparity.

720
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,980
And in a good fortune,
really.

721
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,810
Uh,
so,

722
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,700
uh,
he wrote this book,

723
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:30,100
it had a chapter on race which talked 
about the disparities in,

724
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,240
in racial groups,
statistically observed disparities.

725
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,770
And,
uh,

726
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,830
the claim about the source of those 
disparities was by even the standards of

727
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:46,530
the time,
but certainly the standards of today and

728
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,400
incredibly tepid mealy mouthed,
just hand waving.

729
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,740
It was not this,
you know,

730
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,220
here comes the Third Reich Declaration 
of,

731
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,640
of white supremacy.
It was undoubtedly,

732
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:04,641
there are environmental engineers,
etic reasons for this and we don't 

733
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:05,070
understand them,
you know,

734
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,280
it was just like,
to think that is one or the other.

735
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,890
We're not in a position to know what the
mix is of,

736
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:12,270
of,
of influences now.

737
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,750
Um,
and that is a virtually any honest 

738
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,220
scientists take on the matter.
Um,

739
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,140
and certainly today,
I mean,

740
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,980
it's only become more so,
uh,

741
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,700
but that went off like a nuclear bomb.
I mean,

742
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,800
that was just,
that was such a,

743
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,210
um,
uh,

744
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,680
I mean it's,
it's the most,

745
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,780
um,
so,

746
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:36,690
and at the time I never read the book,
I just thought this had to be.

747
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,400
That's cool.
It would be vilified for,

748
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,500
for that obs and he,
he's been vilified ever since then,

749
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:47,501
ever since I've ignored him.
He need deep platformed and assaulted 

750
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:48,140
recently.
So that's what happened.

751
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,300
So,
so he went to Middlebury to give a talk,

752
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,850
you know,
20 some odd years,

753
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:55,010
25 years after he wrote this book.
Oh,

754
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:56,840
by the way,
he's also listed by the southern poverty

755
00:36:56,841 --> 00:37:01,841
law center and so that,
that that's what contributed to the d 

756
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:03,770
platforming and the violent protest 
against him at Middlebury.

757
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,040
What's crazy is the whole thing is a 
propaganda for the superiority of the 

758
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,060
Asian race and everyone's going to say 
that they,

759
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,970
we'll talk about white supremacy and far
and above.

760
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:19,971
I mean,
that's basically what his book proved 

761
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,301
and you know,
they're suing Harvard now there's a 

762
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:24,580
group of Asian students that are suing 
Harvard because they're discriminated 

763
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,870
against because they're required to have
higher scores because they're assumed to

764
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:27,530
be smarter.

765
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:32,650
So the standards for Asian students 
entering into Harvard is higher than 

766
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:32,650
white people.
Wow.

767
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,310
Yes.
Well,

768
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,940
Asian privilege has a big problem.
Yeah.

769
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,490
Your grandfather was working on the 
railroads in California as an indentured

770
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,100
servant and all by privileged trickled 
down.

771
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,770
There's obviously a lot of factors that 
lead to icu to,

772
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,710
to hire cute,
but to ignore what those are,

773
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:52,590
to ignore it completely to ideology.
Yes,

774
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,610
exactly.
Only ideology and this idea that you 

775
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,221
cannot look at statistics,
you cannot look at facts and in your 

776
00:38:00,221 --> 00:38:01,760
conversation with Ezra Charles,
that sort of or as reclined rather.

777
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:06,761
That's what I got is that this is,
this is an ideological issue and that 

778
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:07,650
you,
you,

779
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,790
it's almost like an impossible subject 
to breach,

780
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:16,090
like you can't even discuss the fact 
that certain races demonstrate low Iq 

781
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:22,301
and then let's look at what could be the
cost of those even discussing that 

782
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:27,010
somehow or another is so inherently 
racist that it must be ignored or it 

783
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,571
must be silenced and that you must first
concentrate on all the various 

784
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:33,440
injustices that have been done to those 
people who have this lower Iq.

785
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Yeah.
Well let me just take a couple minutes 

786
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:38,500
to close

787
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,040
the various doors.
Take owl that are now a jar based on 

788
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,340
what we've said on your holiday and you 
get so.

789
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,280
So we'll just take a little more 
context.

790
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,150
So yeah,
as you said,

791
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:51,151
Charles Murray went to Middlebury 
College and was d platform and he was 

792
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:54,121
not only the platform,
so the usual the platform and with the 

793
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,641
students turning their back to the 
speaker and shouting and not let 

794
00:38:56,641 --> 00:38:58,480
anything happen,
but the professor who invited him,

795
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:01,300
who is a liberal professor who wanted to
essentially debate him,

796
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,030
he wants to act when they're leaving the
hall,

797
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,900
they both get physically attacked by a,
a crowd of students.

798
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,820
Charles was,
was not hurt.

799
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:15,450
His host,
a female professor got a concussion and 

800
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:19,411
a neck injury that,
that still persist and this now more 

801
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:19,411
than a year later.
So I was like,

802
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:20,230
Shit that she was actually a registered 
Democrat by this.

803
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,430
No doubt.

804
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:26,490
And,
and they're driving out in an suv where 

805
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,100
that gets,
I mean someone pulls a stop sign out of 

806
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,040
the sidewalk and I still got the 
concrete ball on the end of it and this 

807
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,580
suv gets smashed with this concrete laid
and stop sign.

808
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,940
I mean this was,
this is happening at one of the most 

809
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,410
liberal privileged colleges on earth.
It's nuts.

810
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,680
So anyway,
that was the thing that put Marie on my 

811
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,591
radar after all these many years of my 
ignoring him and I had actually I felt 

812
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:53,200
guilty because I had declined to be a 
part of at least one project because his

813
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:54,520
name was attached,
right?

814
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,230
Because I just thought that this guy is 
radioactive.

815
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:58,720
He's,
he's got some white supremacist agenda.

816
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,550
I had believed the,
the,

817
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,230
the,
the lies about him.

818
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,360
Uh,
and then I saw this and I thought,

819
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:09,361
okay,
well maybe he is the canary in the coal 

820
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:11,221
mine or,
or certainly one of the canaries in the 

821
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:11,221
coal mine that I had ignored where the,
as you say,

822
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:15,820
there's certain topics are considered so
politically fraught that you cannot 

823
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:18,280
discuss them no matter what is true.

824
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,570
Like this is like,
it's just a,

825
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,660
you know,
there has to be a firewall between your 

826
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,770
conversation about reality and these 
sorts of facts.

827
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,770
Uh,
and so,

828
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,240
you know,
he said he's been suffering from having 

829
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,130
transgress that boundary.
And so I had him on the,

830
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:41,150
on the podcast a being fairly agnostic 
about his,

831
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,210
his actual social policy commitments and
his political concerns.

832
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,740
And just wanting to talk about,
uh,

833
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:54,230
you know,
the facts and so far as we touch them 

834
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,470
lightly,
they had zero interest in intelligence,

835
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:59,470
a as measured by Iq a,
although it's an interesting subject,

836
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:00,060
but I hadn't,
you know,

837
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,100
hadn't spent much time focused on that 
and I had a truly zero interest in 

838
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:09,880
establishing differences between 
populations with respect to intelligence

839
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:12,970
or anything else.
But I see what's coming.

840
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:17,971
I see the fact that,
that the more we understand ourselves 

841
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:21,660
genetically and environmentally,
the more we will if we go looking or 

842
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,831
even if we're not looking,
we will discover differences between 

843
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:25,831
groups.

844
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:29,790
And the end game for us as a species is 
not to deny that those differences exist

845
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:35,521
or could possibly exist.
It's too deny that they have real 

846
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:37,510
political implication.
I mean with the,

847
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:42,511
the political employ,
the political framework we need is a 

848
00:41:42,511 --> 00:41:45,701
commitment to,
to equality across the board and a 

849
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:47,870
commitment to treating individuals as 
individuals.

850
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:52,871
There's nobody who's the average of a 
population is meaningless with respect 

851
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:58,421
to you.
And that will always be so and I'm and 

852
00:41:58,881 --> 00:41:59,570
whatever,
you know,

853
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,980
whatever diversity of talents there is 
statistically in various populations,

854
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,460
we want societies that simply don't care
politically about that.

855
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:16,511
I mean that's just,
it's just not what it's our political 

856
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:22,901
tolerance of one another and supportive 
of one another is not predicated on 

857
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:27,650
denying individual differences or even 
statistical differences across groups.

858
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:31,700
It can't be because we know that there 
are people walking around like a,

859
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,280
you know,
Elon musk who gets out of bed every 

860
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,280
morning and does the work of like 4,000
people.

861
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,130
Right?
And people who just are struggling to 

862
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,061
work at starbucks and hold down a job.
And our political system,

863
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:52,880
we don't say one person is more valuable
politically and socially than another,

864
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,690
even though one person is capable of 
doing massive things that,

865
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,620
that,
that,

866
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,050
that,
uh,

867
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,580
many,
most other people aren't.

868
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:04,210
It's when it comes time to,
to write laws and create institutions 

869
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:07,520
that protect that,
that support human flourishing.

870
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,360
We,
we have to engineer times that raise all

871
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:12,290
the boats.
And so,

872
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:12,800
you know,
and,

873
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:17,801
and you know,
they're legitimate debates about the 

874
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:20,621
social policies that will do that and 
they're legitimate debates about facts 

875
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:22,650
so we can debate scientific fact and,
and you know,

876
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,620
the,
the results of,

877
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,100
you know,
psychometric testing or,

878
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,560
or behavioral genetics that are relevant
to this question of intelligence,

879
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,920
uh,
and we have a good faith debate about 

880
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:35,920
the data.
And then we can have a good faith debate

881
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,850
about social policy that should follow 
from the data.

882
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:43,210
But what's happening on the left now is 
on either at either of those two tiers 

883
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:49,421
of conversation,
there are just straight up allegations 

884
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:49,421
of,
of,

885
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:52,300
of racism that hits you the moment you 
touch certain certain.

886
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:52,630
Yeah.

887
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,660
Can I say that?
The,

888
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,100
that,
what he's just summarize that.

889
00:43:55,101 --> 00:44:00,101
And what I've heard sounds to me as 
being more humane than the implications 

890
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,390
of the argument that the left who were 
opposing will.

891
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:07,250
Sam has just said,
oh,

892
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,760
because if you think about it,
the implications of their argument would

893
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:15,761
be there.
They want to deny the facts because 

894
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:15,761
they're scared that those facts

895
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,690
word

896
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,860
from which there would be derived a 
policy that would reflect those facts 

897
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,720
and otherwise in their minds they are 
marrying those two.

898
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:30,721
They are marrying the notion that if in 
statistical observance there are 

899
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:31,890
variances in Iq between groups

900
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,040
in their minds that means the policy 
should follow from that,

901
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,640
so it's why they're resisting what he 
saying.

902
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:44,300
Whereas what he's saying is there is no 
connection between what the policy 

903
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,421
should be and what the facts may be 
because of the kind of world we want to 

904
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:50,601
live in,
a should aspire to equality regardless 

905
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:53,661
of what the science is saying,
because one is policy and one is 

906
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:54,240
science.
I freely agree with you on that,

907
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:56,610
but I don't think that's necessarily 
exactly what they're saying.

908
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,170
Well,
I think what they're saying is,

909
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:03,171
and what they're doing is they almost 
feel so guilty that any discussion 

910
00:45:03,171 --> 00:45:06,621
whatsoever about race can't be held 
unless you repeatedly bring up all the 

911
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:12,201
instances of racism and suppression that
indiscrimination that that group has 

912
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,280
suffered from.
It's like you can't.

913
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:19,310
It doesn't exist as a statistic island.
You have to bring everything in together

914
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:25,161
if you don't do that,
that's where their protest comes from 

915
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:28,160
and I think that was one of the things 
that I got from your conversation with 

916
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,590
another client,
wasn't willing to just discuss what's 

917
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,210
the implication of these issues and 
completely dismissed this.

918
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,180
This fact that Asian people score far 
better.

919
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,460
There is not a.
there's not a place for that by,

920
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,870
by conceding on the data.
It's almost as if they fear that the 

921
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,801
implication must necessarily follow that
the policy will also be supremacist in 

922
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:49,290
that way.
I wonder.

923
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:54,710
I honestly think what we talked about 
before is a big part of it is 

924
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,700
ideological idea sport and that they're 
just volleying back.

925
00:45:56,701 --> 00:46:01,701
I don't think they're willing to take.
I think one of the real strengths of 

926
00:46:01,701 --> 00:46:04,851
character that you demonstrate in a 
debate or any discussion of facts is 

927
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:08,750
when uncomfortable truths rear their 
ugly head that are counter to your,

928
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:10,080
uh,
your personal position.

929
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,600
You have to be able to go.
You got a really good point.

930
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,610
You've got a good point.
There's something to that.

931
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:15,870
I see what you're saying.
Okay.

932
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,490
This is what my concern would be into.

933
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,920
This would be a rational,
real conversation.

934
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:25,130
This is what I would worry about,
and then you would I'm sure say 

935
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:25,130
absolutely.
I would worry about that as well,

936
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,640
and then you would have this sort of a 
discussion.

937
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:28,830
I didn't get that from that conversation
you had.

938
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,570
I got ping pong,
I got blah,

939
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:30,950
blah,
blah,

940
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,310
blah,
blah,

941
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,710
blah,
blah,

942
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:36,711
blah.
I got this rallying back and forth of 

943
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,591
ideas rather than two human beings not 
digging their heels into the sand.

944
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,160
Just trying to look at the ideas and 
look at the statistics and look at these

945
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:49,161
studies for what they are and look at 
Charles Murray and what he's gone 

946
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:52,251
through and should we be able to examine
these statistical anomalies should be 

947
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:57,261
able to examine athletic superiority.
Should we be able to examine a 

948
00:46:57,261 --> 00:47:00,090
superiority that a Asians show in 
mathematics and a lot of the sciences,

949
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,240
should we.
Should we be able to or should we just 

950
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,311
dig our heads in this?
Should we just let things sort 

951
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:07,311
themselves out and quietly ignore all 
the reality?

952
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:08,550
Yeah.
I don't know why,

953
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,560
so I should say that I am,
I certainly understand people's fear 

954
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:19,430
that if you,
that anyone who would go looking for 

955
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,100
racial difference is very likely 
motivated,

956
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,640
motivated by something unethical or 
unsavory.

957
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,110
Right.
So like,

958
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,480
like you could imagine,
you know,

959
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:29,481
white supremacists being being super 
enamored of this

960
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,770
possibility that these data says yes and
they all.

961
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:37,830
Yes.
And so they look at the Asian 

962
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:37,830
statistics.
Uh,

963
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:38,800
so,
so that's,

964
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:42,880
I get that right.
And there is some things that,

965
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:45,070
and this was the question I had for 
Charles Murray on,

966
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,490
on that podcast,
I said like,

967
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,900
why pay attention to any of this?
What is the upside in the,

968
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,260
in the infinity of,
of interesting problems we can tackle 

969
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,520
scientifically.
Why focus on population differences?

970
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:58,930
And you know,
frankly,

971
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:01,630
I didn't get a great answer from him and
his answer his answer,

972
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,930
his answer is,
well,

973
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:08,470
I think the best version of his answer,
which I agree with,

974
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:11,920
but still it may not justify certain 
certain uses of attention.

975
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:17,310
It's just that if you,
there's this massive bias that I'm 

976
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:24,210
basically,
we're all working with a blank slate 

977
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,660
genetically,
and therefore any difference you see 

978
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,230
among people is a matter of,
of environment.

979
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:34,530
And so,
so then you have people have privileged 

980
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,370
environments and people who have 
environments that,

981
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,170
that,
um,

982
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,300
uh,
where they're massively under resourced.

983
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,780
And so therefore any different 
representation at the,

984
00:48:46,431 --> 00:48:51,431
you know,
the higher echelons of success and 

985
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:52,030
achievement and power in our society.
Uh,

986
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:57,090
you know,
if there's 13 percent African Americans 

987
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,101
in theU ,
s if you look at the top doctors in 

988
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:01,340
hospitals or the top academics or the,
um,

989
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,550
you know,
the Oscar winners or wherever,

990
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:04,750
you know,
wherever you want to look for,

991
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:05,860
for,
for achievement.

992
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,520
If there are less than 13 percent 
African Americans in any one of those 

993
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,901
bins,
that has to be the result of racism or 

994
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:18,580
systemic racism.
That is the left,

995
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,020
the left word bias at this moment.
And so it is with Jews for antisemitism.

996
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:24,910
So it is for women.
Um,

997
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:29,911
you know,
there should be an equal representation 

998
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:30,940
of women in computer,
software engineers at Google,

999
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,750
at any lack of any disparity.

1000
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:39,750
There must be the result of either a 
just inequitable resources for kids in 

1001
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:48,001
schools or,
or somewhere along the way or I'm kind 

1002
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,860
of a selection pressure from the top 
that,

1003
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,230
you know,
we,

1004
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:51,540
you know,
we don't like women in,

1005
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:56,580
at Google or blacks at the Oscars.
And so that's the.

1006
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,030
So Marie's concern is if you believe 
that,

1007
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,810
and I'm not exactly what he said,
but this is,

1008
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,960
this is what I believe he thinks,
but I could be putting some words into 

1009
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,631
his mouth here,
but this is certainly what many other 

1010
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:12,940
people on his side of the debate thing,
if you believe that you will,

1011
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:17,941
can consistently find racial bias and 
antisemitism and mysogeny where it 

1012
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:20,260
doesn't exist.
Right?

1013
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:21,830
So like if you,
if you go look,

1014
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,270
if you go to a hospital and the,
and this is a real problem there,

1015
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,720
like,
like you know,

1016
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:30,810
the academic departments in the medical 
schools at the best medical schools are 

1017
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:34,451
under massive pressure to find like real
diversity in representation at the 

1018
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:39,020
highest level you need to find a ta head
of cardiology,

1019
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:40,040
his black right.

1020
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:44,000
Um,
and if you and you and the fact that you

1021
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:48,920
haven't done that is a sign that there's
a problem with you and your organization

1022
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,710
and your process of hiring.
Now,

1023
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,870
if it's just the case for whatever 
reason,

1024
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:58,871
that there are not many candidates 
likely have less than 13 percent for 

1025
00:50:58,871 --> 00:51:00,800
that field or to take the,
you know,

1026
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:03,050
the James Damore memo memo at Google,
right?

1027
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,450
If it just is the case that women forget
about this,

1028
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:08,720
is that this was beyond aptitude.
This just goes to interest.

1029
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:11,480
If it's the case that women,
for whatever reason,

1030
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,020
genetic and or environmental are less 
interested in being software engineers 

1031
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:23,230
on average than men are than you then 
having 20 percent women's coding 

1032
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:27,080
software at Google is not the price.
It's not Google's problem,

1033
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,280
it's just the fact that this is the 
popular,

1034
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:34,330
what the population interests are.
Now we should no doubt racism still 

1035
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:39,641
exists,
no doubt misogyny and sexism still 

1036
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:39,641
exists there.
There are,

1037
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:41,630
I mean there's proof of this to be found
as well,

1038
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:46,631
but if to assume an absolute uniformity 
of human,

1039
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:52,290
of interest and aptitude in every 
population you could look at is just 

1040
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,000
scientifically irrational.
That would be a miracle

1041
00:51:56,050 --> 00:52:01,050
that were the case.
So at this stage allow me to remind 

1042
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,691
everybody that was sam summarizing what 
he thinks Charles Murray was saying as 

1043
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:03,691
opposed to Sam w.
no,

1044
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:04,380
nope,
no.

1045
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:07,690
My final point is it's just a true 
point.

1046
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:13,250
Their jeans,
almost everything we care about are 

1047
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,940
massively influenced by genes.
Not One hundred percent to you though is

1048
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:18,370
that people have taken your summaries of
other people's stuff,

1049
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,760
but that wasn't even necessarily Charles
Murray's position.

1050
00:52:21,761 --> 00:52:26,761
Your.
It's your summary of his position in 

1051
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:28,330
relationship to this.
This fight against that.

1052
00:52:28,331 --> 00:52:33,331
The thing that I would add and the thing
where there's some daylight between the 

1053
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:33,331
two of us,
me and him

1054
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:38,340
on my podcast is this is so toxic to be 
trafficking in population differences 

1055
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:49,420
with respect to icu,
that and it's not,

1056
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:54,450
it's not absolutely clear what social 
policies turn on really nailing down 

1057
00:52:55,031 --> 00:52:55,780
these differences.
I mean,

1058
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,600
so you could go want me to take it even 
more toxic as an example.

1059
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:01,810
Perhaps it's like you could decide,
uh,

1060
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,720
you know,
the Roma in Europe that the Gypsies like

1061
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:08,620
this is like a very isolated,
beleaguered community.

1062
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,180
Who knows how in bread it is.
Um,

1063
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,790
I don't know.
It's just this is a,

1064
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:18,180
this is an outlier community.
Like anyone who's going to want to do 

1065
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,530
massive Iq testing on the Roma.
What's the,

1066
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,210
what's the point of doing that?
Right?

1067
00:53:22,211 --> 00:53:22,740
Like,
you know,

1068
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,610
like it seems like a,
just a,

1069
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,970
a kind of political time bomb to devote 
resources in that way because we know 

1070
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,530
that the policy you want whatever new,
whatever this,

1071
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:43,610
the main ICU is of any group,
the policy you want is to give everyone 

1072
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,220
whatever opportunities they can avail 
themselves of.

1073
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:52,220
So we want,
we want people to have the best schools 

1074
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:52,790
they can use and then we'll find people 
who need to be in,

1075
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:55,290
in more remedial schools for whatever 
reason,

1076
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:56,310
or you know,
people like,

1077
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,610
you know,
the one population that has 10 times the

1078
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,040
amount of dyslexia than another 
population say,

1079
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,830
and they'll be undoubtedly genetic 
reasons for that,

1080
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:09,860
you know,
there may be environmental reasons for 

1081
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:09,860
that as well,
but there's,

1082
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:14,330
we need to be able to cater to all of 
those needs with just this fundamental 

1083
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:20,631
commitment to goodwill and equality 
without being panicked that we'll find 

1084
00:54:20,631 --> 00:54:24,450
stuff that just blows everything up.
But on the left there,

1085
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:29,451
there's the sense that the only way to 
move forward toward equality is to lie 

1086
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:35,420
about what is scientifically pause,
plausible and demonize anyone who won't 

1087
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:35,420
lie with you.

1088
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,090
That's the ideological point that this 
is a new thing though,

1089
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,020
right?
I mean,

1090
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:44,610
relatively speaking,
this,

1091
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:49,611
uh,
this hard nose stance from the left of 

1092
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:49,611
the equality of outcome.
And,

1093
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:53,340
and the only reason why there wouldn't 
be 50 percent women or 50 percent black,

1094
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,860
50 percent in it.
You just pick any marginalized group.

1095
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,360
The only reason why it wouldn't be even 
across the board with all other races is

1096
00:54:59,361 --> 00:55:02,020
because of discrimination.
This is a fairly new stance.

1097
00:55:02,021 --> 00:55:02,580
So I mean,
there were,

1098
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:07,581
there were moments that were fairly well
publicized that I don't forget when 

1099
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:11,961
Larry Summers got fired from Harvard,
so Larry Summers was the president of 

1100
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:14,811
Harvard and he's a famous economist and 
he gave a speech for which she was 

1101
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:16,730
fired.
Uh,

1102
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,990
there might be a little more color as to
why he was fired.

1103
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:23,040
He was fired because he,
he wants the wheels started to come off.

1104
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:28,490
He didn't,
he had alienated enough people that he 

1105
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:28,490
didn't have friends to kind of prop him 
up.

1106
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,430
But,
but the thing that pulled the wheels off

1107
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:33,630
was that he gave a speech and he said,
we know there are,

1108
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:39,080
are differences in,
in the bell curves that describing a 

1109
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,190
mathematical aptitude between men and 
women.

1110
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:46,790
And this explains why there are many 
more top flight male mathematicians and 

1111
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:50,370
engineers than women.
And it's not that they even,

1112
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,770
it's not that the,
uh,

1113
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,240
the means of the,
uh,

1114
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,000
the,
the,

1115
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,560
of the bell curves are different.
So the,

1116
00:55:57,561 --> 00:56:02,561
the means could be the same,
but there could be more variant so that 

1117
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:02,720
the tails are thicker in the case of,
of the mail,

1118
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:03,600
but bulk herbs,
so at the,

1119
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,330
at the absolute ends,
both the,

1120
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,640
the low end and high end,
you have many more people.

1121
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,090
So you know,
if you're,

1122
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:13,620
if you're going to ask you what's the in
the same size population,

1123
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,670
how many people do you have at the 99 
point nine,

1124
00:56:17,671 --> 00:56:21,540
nine,
nine percentile of aptitude in math.

1125
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,110
Say it could be that you have and 
there's,

1126
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:29,130
there's a fair amount of data to show 
this many more men at the tails than 

1127
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:29,650
women.
Right?

1128
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:34,651
And,
and that's true for grandmasters in 

1129
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:34,651
chess,
right?

1130
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,280
It's just this is not a,
a,

1131
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,960
and it may be true for something like,
you know,

1132
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,940
playing pool,
you know,

1133
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,460
I mean they're,
they're,

1134
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:43,150
they're just differences and that may 
not be entirely environmental.

1135
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:45,700
Almost certainly are not entirely 
environmental.

1136
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,110
Uh,
that is one,

1137
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,520
right?
It's a big issue in the world of pool 

1138
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,620
men and women play separately and 
there's no reason physically why they 

1139
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:55,620
shouldn't.
Yeah,

1140
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:55,620
they're not,
it's not a strength game,

1141
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,120
but women are allowed to play in men's 
tournaments,

1142
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:03,121
but they never.
When Jean Baluchis was a woman who was 

1143
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:06,990
a,
she was like one of the only women ever 

1144
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,511
compete and beat men.
She's like an extreme outlier and this 

1145
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:12,661
was like,
I want to say it was in the late 

1146
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:12,661
seventies and eighties.

1147
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:16,690
And other than that there's been a few 
women that have done well in 

1148
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:19,921
tournaments,
but when they come to Major League 

1149
00:57:19,921 --> 00:57:20,680
professional pool tournaments,
they're almost always one by men.

1150
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:21,120
Um,
and um,

1151
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,340
when I say almost,
I mean like 99 point nine percent.

1152
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:27,010
So there was a,
a Commonwealth Games have been happening

1153
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:32,130
as we,
it was just over the last couple of 

1154
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,170
weeks and there was a male to female 
transgender athlete in the weight 

1155
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,760
lifting category.
That's a whole nother ball.

1156
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:41,820
Participated in the women's competition 
and the Commonwealth Games at the time 

1157
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:48,481
of her joining hadn't yet put down a 
rule asked to testosterone levels in 

1158
00:57:48,481 --> 00:57:53,400
females competing.
And so this male to female transgender 

1159
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,290
person qualified in the female games and
was as you'd expect,

1160
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:01,650
I'm winning in all of the Games and was 
the front runner and destined to win the

1161
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:07,381
competition as a male to female 
transgender person and the only reason 

1162
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:11,880
and it would have led to a huge crisis 
in the Commonwealth Games because there 

1163
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,010
was some resistance to this notion.

1164
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,960
I'm out.
Of course,

1165
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:18,961
the questions that arise is this fat men
will naturally with higher levels of 

1166
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:19,060
testosterone.
For example.

1167
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,360
The only reason it didn't lead to the 
crunch time and that was a huge scandal 

1168
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:24,360
of,
of,

1169
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,580
of winning is that she injured herself 
in the competition and by sheer 

1170
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:28,900
accident.
Yeah,

1171
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:34,020
I saw that.
I can expand on that a little bit 

1172
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,031
because I've actually gone through this 
extensively because there was a woman 

1173
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:39,691
who was used to be a man,
was competing in mixed martial arts 

1174
00:58:39,691 --> 00:58:40,480
against women and just beating the shit 
out of them.

1175
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:44,710
And I was saying that this is,
this is a mistake and that you're.

1176
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,740
You're looking at whether someone should
be legally able to identify as a woman 

1177
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,040
portray themselves.
A woman,

1178
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:51,730
absolutely.
Yeah.

1179
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,030
Do you have the freedom to become a 
woman in quotes?

1180
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,110
In our society?
Yes,

1181
00:58:56,111 --> 00:59:01,111
but you can't deny biological nature and
there's physiological advantages to the 

1182
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:05,611
male frame.
There's specifically when it comes to 

1183
00:59:05,611 --> 00:59:06,310
combat sports,
that's my wheelhouse.

1184
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:11,370
I'm an expert.
I understand there's a giant difference 

1185
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:14,551
between the amount of power that a man 
and a woman can generate and if you're 

1186
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,980
telling me that a guy living 30 years of
his life as a man that's,

1187
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:20,590
that's essentially like a woman being on
steroids for 30 years.

1188
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,130
Then getting off and

1189
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:27,130
then having regular women being forced 
to compete with her and try to pretend 

1190
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,640
this a level playing field.
It is not.

1191
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,620
There's a difference in the shape of the
hips,

1192
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,750
the size of the shoulder,
the density of the bones,

1193
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:37,970
the size of the fists.
That's a giant factor in your ability to

1194
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:40,340
generate power is the size of your 
fists.

1195
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,680
It's also an ethical problem and it's 
not just competition.

1196
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:46,310
Here is he have girls getting beaten up 
by someone who used to be a man.

1197
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:51,311
Yes,
but people came down on me harder than 

1198
00:59:51,311 --> 00:59:52,610
anything that I've ever stood up for in 
my life,

1199
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,190
never in my life do I think there's 
going to be a situation where I said,

1200
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,540
hey,
I don't think that guy should be able to

1201
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:58,400
get his penis removed and beat the shit 
out of women,

1202
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:03,490
and then people like you're out of line,
but that's the summary of this.

1203
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,050
That's literally what happened.
This is a conversation that I had with a

1204
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:10,010
woman online as well during this whole 
thing.

1205
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:15,670
She said she,
this person who had turned into a woman 

1206
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,750
has always been a woman and I said,
but she was a man for 30 years.

1207
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:18,170
She goes,
no,

1208
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:19,430
she's always been a woman.
I go,

1209
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:24,560
even when she had sex with a woman and 
fathered a kid and she says,

1210
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,060
yes.
Even then I go,

1211
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:31,061
well,
we're done because you're just talking 

1212
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:31,061
nonsense.
This is ideology,

1213
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:32,710
ideology cover exact.
The front says they are just that.

1214
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:37,750
She had a male physique.
This person who was arguing with me 

1215
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:41,480
wants to claim this moral high ground of
being the most progressive and they're 

1216
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:46,001
always looking to step on top of anybody
who's less progressive than than and 

1217
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:49,190
complaint and proclaim superiority,
and this is the ideological sport.

1218
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,970
This is the idea sport that you see with
what people are playing.

1219
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,570
Ping Pong with our ideas and not 
listening you.

1220
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,500
You need to listen to experts in when 
you're.

1221
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,040
Especially when you're talk about 
martial arts,

1222
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,600
there's a the the.
The difference is so profound and the 

1223
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,151
results are so critical because you're 
talking about a sport where the 

1224
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:12,170
objective goal,
the goal is clear.

1225
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:14,900
It's very clear.
Beat the fuck out of the other person in

1226
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:19,901
front of you,
so anything that would give you an 

1227
01:01:19,901 --> 01:01:22,331
advantage in beating the fuck out of 
that person should be really looked at 

1228
01:01:22,331 --> 01:01:25,871
very carefully and not thrown through 
the lens of this progressive ideological

1229
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:28,910
filter that we're going through right 
now because that's what it is.

1230
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:32,330
I mean that's how people are looking at 
it and it's with weightlifting as well.

1231
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:36,350
When transgendered athletes going to 
weightlifting competitions,

1232
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:41,300
the male to female transgender athletes 
are overwhelmingly dominant.

1233
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,470
I mean,
is this,

1234
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,420
is this a coincidence or it's.

1235
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:49,420
No,
it's someone who had fucking 

1236
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,891
testosterone pumping through their 
system and n and a y chromosome their 

1237
01:01:50,891 --> 01:01:52,040
whole life and now all of a sudden we're
supposed to say no.

1238
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,000
She's a woman.
She's a.

1239
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,030
she's dainty.
She's got size 14 feet.

1240
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,210
She's got gorilla hands.
Like what in the fuck are we doing?

1241
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:01,340
So,
so I think as you said earlier,

1242
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,400
it's she is a woman,
but for the purposes of competition 

1243
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:06,740
against other women,
you know,

1244
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:11,741
legally she's a woman at that stage.
She goes through that identity 

1245
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:12,020
transition,
but I think we have to recognize it.

1246
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:17,021
I think even many traditional feminists,
I'm making this point much to the angle 

1247
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,090
of the Trans community.
They're hold on you.

1248
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,160
What you're doing in this way is 
actually we fought so hard and so long 

1249
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,000
for these female spaces where we have a 
space of our own and that's people that 

1250
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,621
used to be men are coming into those 
spaces is actually quite literally 

1251
01:02:33,621 --> 01:02:33,830
beating the crap out of us spaces.

1252
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,560
Whether it's in boxing,
whether it's in weight lifting and 

1253
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:39,560
martial arts,
they are,

1254
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:45,410
by definition they dominating or this of
course they offer what the reasons 

1255
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:48,291
you've said experts that they're calling
upon or almost all transitioned doctors,

1256
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:53,631
surgeons or people that have 
transitioned themselves when they speak 

1257
01:02:53,631 --> 01:02:58,101
to actual board certified 
endocrinologist and some of the only do 

1258
01:02:58,101 --> 01:03:01,371
it off record,
but one of 'em forget her name.

1259
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:04,980
She was in one of the big mixed martial 
arts publications.

1260
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,900
Ramona crushed sec,
I believe is her name.

1261
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,740
She's saying,
no,

1262
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:13,790
not only does it it it actually doing 
this transition like from male to 

1263
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,300
female,
you're forcing your.

1264
01:03:16,301 --> 01:03:21,301
You're putting estrogen into the system,
so the bone density change that would 

1265
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:25,671
ordinarily take place if you removed,
so it's testicles and stopped the 

1266
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:25,671
distance,
the production of testosterone.

1267
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:31,180
Estrogen preserves bone density,
so you're actually retaining the male 

1268
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:31,180
bone density.

1269
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:36,230
There's so many problems with this and 
that and that was one of the other 

1270
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,230
things.
They say,

1271
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,300
well,
oh,

1272
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:37,890
the Olympics,
the Olympics allow it.

1273
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,470
The Olympics are very ideologically 
based.

1274
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,330
There's not a whole lot of science to 
this.

1275
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:47,520
This transition thing of allowing male 
to female athletes to compete in the 

1276
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,251
Olympics and there's an extreme amount 
of corruption in the Olympics as it is 

1277
01:03:52,711 --> 01:03:57,711
with the IOC being in bed with water,
the world antidoping agency and the way 

1278
01:03:57,711 --> 01:04:01,821
they handle this Russian scandal,
I mean this Russian scandal that was 

1279
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:02,100
highlighted in that fantastic 
documentary,

1280
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:06,900
icarus like fucking crazy,
the Olympics or not to be trusted.

1281
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:11,901
That is a gigantic multibillion dollar 
business where the athletes get paid 

1282
01:04:11,901 --> 01:04:15,861
zero money.
It is inherently corrupt from the top 

1283
01:04:15,861 --> 01:04:15,861
down,
no doubt about it,

1284
01:04:15,861 --> 01:04:20,720
so to to call upon them is to see who 
should be competing as a woman fuck off.

1285
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:22,980
They're not the experts.
This is.

1286
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:26,190
This is not something that's been 
examined and this is coming from someone

1287
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:31,310
who.
One of my jobs is examining and 

1288
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:32,640
commentating on fights.
That is a big part of what I do.

1289
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,670
I understand fights and I know what it 
looks like when a man's beating the shit

1290
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:40,671
out of a woman and that's what it looked
like when this person was fighting 

1291
01:04:40,671 --> 01:04:40,671
women.
It was.

1292
01:04:40,671 --> 01:04:41,730
There was a massive physical advantage,
massive,

1293
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,390
not a skill advantage.
What was the,

1294
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,300
you mentioned something about the 
reaction that you got to that.

1295
01:04:45,301 --> 01:04:46,440
What was the trouble you're going to 
insult?

1296
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:48,570
People are so mad at me.
I mean it was just so many.

1297
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:51,360
Not only that,
they took my words out of context.

1298
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:56,361
They quoted all these different gender 
transition doctors saying that there's 

1299
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:01,650
no science behind this and the science 
behind it being totally fair and totally

1300
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:02,040
equal.

1301
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:06,200
It's just not and people know it.
Everyone knows live.

1302
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:11,350
They couldn't put Cris Cyborg against 
this guy and give him a run for his 

1303
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,180
money the wrong way class or that's the 
other way.

1304
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:17,450
That's the other thing,
and we're dealing with a similar 

1305
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:19,401
situation like that in Texas.
I don't know if you know about the girl 

1306
01:05:19,401 --> 01:05:19,401
who was.
She was born a girl.

1307
01:05:19,401 --> 01:05:23,140
She's transitioning to a boy in high 
school taking testosterone,

1308
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:25,990
but in Texas they only allow her to 
compete as a girl,

1309
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:31,140
so she dominated the Texas state 
wrestling championship two years in a 

1310
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:31,990
row and it's horrific because she's on 
steroids.

1311
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:35,560
She's on testosterone for this kind of 
stuff.

1312
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,170
Doesn't matter because they're testing 
chromosome.

1313
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,360
She's a woman.
She was born a woman,

1314
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:41,290
right?
She's born a girl.

1315
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,140
So because the fact that she's 
transitioning to be a boy,

1316
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,100
they don't give a shit.

1317
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,780
You're a woman.
You're not going to wrestle against men.

1318
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,310
You're a girl.
You're not going to wrestle,

1319
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:53,340
wrestle against boys.
So they have allow her under extreme 

1320
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:53,340
protests.
It's terrible.

1321
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,250
She wants to compete or he,
I should say,

1322
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,460
wants to compete as a boy.
They won't let him.

1323
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,630
They say,
no,

1324
01:05:58,631 --> 01:06:00,430
you were born a girl.
You have to compete as a girl.

1325
01:06:00,431 --> 01:06:04,170
So when he competes everybody booze,
it's off.

1326
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,980
It's fucking awful.
I mean,

1327
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:06,260
it's,
it's,

1328
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,580
it's really devastating question for you
that way around.

1329
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:13,060
If it's female to male transition,
uh,

1330
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:18,090
somebody that used to be a woman that 
transitions to a man and wants to 

1331
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,120
compete with the men,
they don't have an advantage.

1332
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:22,120
They don't know.
They don't allow to disadvantage if they

1333
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:24,250
win in that context.
They've actually done really good.

1334
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:25,400
Yes.
Right spot.

1335
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,680
Look,
women can beat men.

1336
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,150
Yeah,
I mean it happens all the time.

1337
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:33,150
At Jujitsu.
There's especially in Jujitsu in 

1338
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:33,150
particular because it's such a technique
based art,

1339
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,840
but it is possible.
There's.

1340
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:39,870
There's also a woman named Jermaine 
Duran to me who's a worldclass mixed 

1341
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:43,411
martial artists whose multiple time 
world champion of fought a man and 

1342
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:43,450
knocked him out.
It's a crazy video.

1343
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,120
She fostered a real man.
Them with a straight right.

1344
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,440
It's.
It is possible for them to win if their 

1345
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,361
skill level is so far superior that it 
overcomes the inherent strength 

1346
01:06:54,361 --> 01:06:58,711
advantages,
but a woman to male transition would be 

1347
01:06:58,711 --> 01:06:59,660
at a severe disadvantage against a 
natural man.

1348
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,280
So would you be in that Texas case?
They clearly have it wrong.

1349
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:06,220
They should.
They should allow him to to compete with

1350
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,860
this and would you be.
Whereas I can.

1351
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:13,950
I think all three of us probably 
instinctively would resist the notion 

1352
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:16,771
that a female,
a male to female athlete competes with 

1353
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:18,310
other females because they'd have to 
resist that.

1354
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:23,310
Yes.
But would you be for a female to male 

1355
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:23,860
athlete competing with men?
Yes,

1356
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,200
because I don't think there's.
There's no,

1357
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:30,620
there's no advantage,
but here's the problem and the consent 

1358
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,170
is sort of running the other direction.
There she is continually putting herself

1359
01:07:32,171 --> 01:07:35,680
or he's putting himself in harm's way 
knowingly,

1360
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:41,170
and I'm not opposed to a woman fighting 
a man if she so chooses like I'm not 

1361
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:45,031
opposed to bull riding if you want to.
I'm not lobbying to get bull riding 

1362
01:07:45,031 --> 01:07:49,930
outlawed,
but if you want to be so fucking stupid 

1363
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:50,050
that you climb on top of a 2000 pound 
angry animal,

1364
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,540
go for it.
Yeah,

1365
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:52,810
maybe you should be able to do whatever 
you want.

1366
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:55,570
I think you should be able to jump out a
fairly good aeros airplanes.

1367
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,100
You know,
if you want to parachute,

1368
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:58,750
you should be able to risk your life.
Parachuting.

1369
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:04,470
The difference lies in just massive 
advantages and that there's a massive 

1370
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,370
advantage in transitioning from male to 
female,

1371
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,770
female to male.
Here's the other problem.

1372
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,020
Female to male.
You have to take testosterone.

1373
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:13,570
You can't legally take testosterone and 
compete.

1374
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,690
It's been a giant in mixed martial arts 
because for the longest time there was a

1375
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:22,691
loophole and the loophole was 
testosterone therapy and they were 

1376
01:08:22,691 --> 01:08:25,811
allowing testosterone replacement 
therapy for male athletes that were 

1377
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:27,740
either older or it's.
It was a.

1378
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:32,510
It was a symptom of having pituitary 
gland damage,

1379
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,820
which comes from head trauma,
which come,

1380
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,250
which means really essentially your 
career should be over,

1381
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:40,130
your body's not producing hormones 
correctly,

1382
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:44,030
and that's a very common issue with 
people that have been in war.

1383
01:08:44,031 --> 01:08:46,060
People that have been blown up by an 
IED,

1384
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:51,100
people that had been hit a lot.
Even soccer players a lot of times show 

1385
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:55,440
a diminished levels of testosterone and 
growth hormone because of pituitary 

1386
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,810
gland damage.
So you wouldn't even allow that.

1387
01:08:56,811 --> 01:09:01,811
So a female to male would be in a whole 
nother problem in combat sports because 

1388
01:09:01,811 --> 01:09:04,130
it's not legal for you to take 
testosterone and compete

1389
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:05,970
right.
Well,

1390
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:11,040
to bring this full circle back to me,
sitting at the pool destroy to destroy 

1391
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,451
my vacation on twitter.
So how long did you spend working on 

1392
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:14,451
this article?
So again,

1393
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:14,900
this was.
This was like,

1394
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:17,810
I must have hated you.
How much was she mad?

1395
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,940
Well,
that it was kind of the perfect storm,

1396
01:09:20,941 --> 01:09:25,941
but there were,
there were a few things that relieved 

1397
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:26,070
the pressure.
One is there was another family from our

1398
01:09:26,071 --> 01:09:26,880
schools,
so they're like,

1399
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,790
my daughter had a friend,
another couple.

1400
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:34,850
That step that we,
that my wife could socialize with and 

1401
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,910
having another couple,
they're forced me to sort of put on my 

1402
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:38,620
social face at dinner and it.

1403
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:39,420
Well,
yeah,

1404
01:09:39,421 --> 01:09:40,520
it's not cheating to look at.
Yeah.

1405
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,080
The thing is,
it's actually not that feeling.

1406
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:48,120
It's horrible,
but it's not mean to say it

1407
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,550
that way.
He's putting on your social phase.

1408
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:54,160
It actually changes your psychology.
I mean like if you have,

1409
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:59,190
if you,
if you have to drop your problem in 

1410
01:09:59,190 --> 01:09:59,190
order to be a normal sane person with 
people you don't know all that well,

1411
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,480
you're actually a happier,
more normal person.

1412
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:06,770
If it had just been me and my wife had 
dinner while I'm dealing with this blow 

1413
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:06,770
up,
I just,

1414
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:10,430
you know,
it just never would have the cloud 

1415
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:10,430
would,
wouldn't have left.

1416
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:10,430
So anyway,
um,

1417
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:10,840
I,
uh,

1418
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:14,080
I was trying,
I was trying not to engage.

1419
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,210
And so I didn't want to have to write 
anything new to deal with this.

1420
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:21,310
This is what I viewed as just an 
egregious attack on,

1421
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,970
on my intellectual and moral integrity.
Uh,

1422
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:28,170
and so when I saw this article from 
Klein,

1423
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,800
um,
I realized I had this email exchange 

1424
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:33,800
with him at the end of which I said,
listen,

1425
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,340
if you,
if you continue to slander me,

1426
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:40,090
this is the head like a year previously 
because there had been released,

1427
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,480
I release this so,
so I said,

1428
01:10:43,481 --> 01:10:44,500
but I said,
at the end of this exchange,

1429
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:49,501
if you continue to slander me,
and if you misrepresent the reasons why 

1430
01:10:49,501 --> 01:10:52,531
we didn't do a podcast because we,
we had had talked publicly about maybe 

1431
01:10:52,531 --> 01:10:54,610
sorting this out on a podcast a year 
ago.

1432
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,990
But I found the exchange with him by 
email.

1433
01:10:56,991 --> 01:11:00,940
So in such bad faith,
I found him so evasive and dishonest.

1434
01:11:00,941 --> 01:11:05,941
And again,
just plain ideological pingpong as you 

1435
01:11:05,941 --> 01:11:08,170
said,
and not actually engaging my points that

1436
01:11:08,171 --> 01:11:08,710
I said,
listen,

1437
01:11:08,711 --> 01:11:13,711
if you,
if you lie about this and you keep 

1438
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:13,711
slandering me,
I'm just going to publish his email.

1439
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:17,400
I think the world should see how you 
operate as a journalist and as an editor

1440
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:22,890
like he hit,
he had declined to publish a far more 

1441
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:23,840
mainstream opinion defending me and 
Marie and inbox.

1442
01:11:23,841 --> 01:11:24,810
I mean he,
and it was just,

1443
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:30,220
it was,
it was truly slanderous and misleading 

1444
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:33,261
everything he's published on this topic 
and he has a huge platform by which to 

1445
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:33,261
do it.
So,

1446
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:35,340
which I enjoy.
I really like box.

1447
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:35,700
Yeah.
No,

1448
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:37,920
I mean I've,
I've read vox.

1449
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:39,360
We pleasure as well,
but it is,

1450
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:43,500
it once you see how the sausage gets 
made on many of these things,

1451
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:44,310
but once,
once your,

1452
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:49,311
the news item,
you can see that there's very little 

1453
01:11:49,311 --> 01:11:49,470
journalistic scruple in the background 
there.

1454
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,570
So I,
um,

1455
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:57,380
I was mad I didn't want to have to spend
my time on vacation writing a retort to 

1456
01:11:57,871 --> 01:12:00,120
this thing,
but I felt like I had to respond.

1457
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:01,290
And again,
this is an illusion.

1458
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:05,160
It was like a sheer confection of 
looking at twitter.

1459
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:10,190
And if I hadn't been looking at twitter 
I wouldn't have felt they had to 

1460
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:10,190
respond.
Um,

1461
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:13,470
and so I responded in the laziest 
possible way,

1462
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:16,260
which I just published the email 
exchange because it's already written,

1463
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:19,350
I don't have to write anything,
you just hit send essentially.

1464
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:24,380
And of course the rest of the world 
didn't know you actually meant to be on 

1465
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,871
vacation right now.
And so there's no context to them as to 

1466
01:12:26,871 --> 01:12:28,290
why you were still.
I,

1467
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:33,291
I massively underestimated the amount of
work even my own fans would have to do 

1468
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,200
to understand why I was so angry and 
that email exchange.

1469
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:42,200
So I came off like the angry bastard in 
the email exchange and he came off as 

1470
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:46,140
this just open minded ready to dialogue 
guy.

1471
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:51,440
Whereas if you follow the plot and you 
saw what he had published about me and 

1472
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:56,430
Ann Marie previously,
this thing that has hit is now on the 

1473
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:57,230
hate watch page SPLC.
Uh,

1474
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,280
he was being totally disingenuous and 
evasive and just,

1475
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,330
they didn't match to his article did 
they not,

1476
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:07,890
not at all.
And so I just kept getting more tuned up

1477
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:13,240
and,
and so I published this thing not 

1478
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:13,240
realizing,
not,

1479
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,440
you know,
it was definitely a mistake to publish 

1480
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:18,440
the email exchange.
Just pragmatically not,

1481
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,240
I don't,
I don't think it was unethical because I

1482
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:25,260
told him I was going to do it in advance
if he kept kept it up.

1483
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:28,980
It was just a,
it was totally counterproductive because

1484
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:31,510
it was his,
he was far more reasonable people,

1485
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:33,060
couldn't he original article.

1486
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,440
Well,
it seems like you that do a lot of work 

1487
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:38,440
to understand it.
But the thing is he wasn't,

1488
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:38,440
it was sued.
He was,

1489
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,370
it was,
it was an appearance of a reason,

1490
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:42,270
but it was,
it was not.

1491
01:13:42,271 --> 01:13:45,000
And then we.
So we finally did this podcast.

1492
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,180
I'm a year hence,
you know,

1493
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:50,550
this is now my last podcast is now,
you know,

1494
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,180
two weeks ago.
And uh,

1495
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,440
you know,
it was basically as bad as I was 

1496
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,621
expecting a and I basic,
I feel that I met the person who I 

1497
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:04,761
thought I was dealing with in the email 
exchange and he was fundamentally 

1498
01:14:04,761 --> 01:14:07,150
unresponsive to any of my points.
And you know,

1499
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,010
as you say,
Joe,

1500
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:12,010
just trying to score political points to
his,

1501
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,620
toward his audience.
And the thing is he has.

1502
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,120
What's that mean?
There's many,

1503
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:21,121
there are many asymmetries here,
but one crucial one is that he has an 

1504
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:25,711
audience that doesn't care about whether
or not he's responsive to the thing that

1505
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,490
his,
his opponent or interlocutor just said,

1506
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:30,730
right?

1507
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,700
It's,
they're not tracking it by that metric.

1508
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:38,020
They're tracking it by,
are you making the political points that

1509
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:39,060
are ongoing,
that are,

1510
01:14:39,061 --> 01:14:42,410
that are massaging that you know,
outraged part of our brains like our go,

1511
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,970
do you have your hands on our Amygdala,
you know,

1512
01:14:44,971 --> 01:14:46,960
and,
and are you pushing the right buttons?

1513
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:52,350
And so he's talking about racism and 
white privilege and I'm granting him all

1514
01:14:53,651 --> 01:14:54,460
of that and say,
listen,

1515
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,900
let me tell you why that's not relevant 
to my concerns.

1516
01:14:58,901 --> 01:15:03,901
And what happened here with Marie.
I'm not gonna I'm everything you're 

1517
01:15:03,901 --> 01:15:03,901
going to say about the history of 
lynching.

1518
01:15:03,901 --> 01:15:04,450
I'm going to grant you.
Right?

1519
01:15:04,451 --> 01:15:05,840
That's not the,
we don't.

1520
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,560
There's no daylight between us there.
And,

1521
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:11,530
but the thing is,
I have an audience that is,

1522
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:16,120
that care is massively about following 
the logic of a conversation.

1523
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:21,121
If somebody makes a point that is even 
close to being good in response to me,

1524
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,280
my audience is like,
you know,

1525
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:24,850
okay,
Sam,

1526
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:26,150
what the fuck are you going to say to 
that?

1527
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:28,650
And if and if I drop that ball,
I,

1528
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:30,330
I lose massive points.
Right?

1529
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:35,580
Whereas I'm often finding myself in 
conversation with people who don't have 

1530
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:36,010
to care about those kinds of audiences.
I mean,

1531
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:41,011
that's,
that was the one I had one with this 

1532
01:15:41,011 --> 01:15:41,140
disease,
the title of the best podcasts ever.

1533
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:46,470
I mean,
he knows his audience does not care 

1534
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,470
about him,
honestly.

1535
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,290
Representing,
in this case,

1536
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:47,730
the doctor

1537
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,340
who was that guy even,
I mean at least Ezra Klein,

1538
01:15:50,341 --> 01:15:51,020
he could say,
okay,

1539
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:53,690
editor of Vox or whatever.
Where did you even find that?

1540
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,010
On twitter?
On twitter.

1541
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:58,930
That's again the twitter growth,
the ruination of podcasts.

1542
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,100
Until this day,
I don't even know who this bloke is,

1543
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,060
who,
this guy is.

1544
01:16:02,061 --> 01:16:04,740
Just some crazy guy.
Me and Nancy.

1545
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,580
What did he call me?
It was because at one point he was going

1546
01:16:07,581 --> 01:16:11,000
on about me being some form of enabler 
of your bigotry and yeah,

1547
01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:15,210
well I mean you're an uncle tom native 
informant or whatever it is,

1548
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,140
but I can show.
I could see this is the.

1549
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:22,010
This is why it's so frustrating because 
I have pretty much memorized inside out,

1550
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,910
back to front the Islamist ideological 
narrative and I could sit here right now

1551
01:16:25,911 --> 01:16:30,080
and play that game with you,
that game of ping pong without conceding

1552
01:16:30,081 --> 01:16:31,220
anything,
and this is where,

1553
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,980
you know,
I feel our conversation went really well

1554
01:16:33,981 --> 01:16:38,981
because it was stripped away from all of
that bullshit and we had a genuine 

1555
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:43,840
conversation.
It's still to this day very easy for me 

1556
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,361
to to play the tune of the Islamist and 
score those points,

1557
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:52,930
especially because some of what I've 
been through school those points and 

1558
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:54,770
just get locked in a.
essentially it's ego,

1559
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,610
but it's,
it's a,

1560
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:57,620
it's,
it's not an intellectual conversation.

1561
01:16:57,621 --> 01:16:58,230
It's a,
it's,

1562
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:00,200
it's a game of you know,
who,

1563
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:05,210
who is,
who is basically checking the right 

1564
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,421
boxes in their own little confirmation 
bias to their own audience and that 

1565
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:09,170
doesn't interest me,
but it's frustrating.

1566
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,160
You're also,
you're also

1567
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,740
the best person on the other side of 
that conversation now.

1568
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:15,140
So there's a series of videos on 
Youtube,

1569
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:16,680
I think it's called Merry Christmas,
Mr.

1570
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:22,740
That's right.
And so on youtube you can watch him 

1571
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:23,000
pitted it against people who are playing
this game,

1572
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:25,760
you know,
Islamists and jihadists of various sorts

1573
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,950
in a.
and that he,

1574
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:33,120
Majid is,
is meeting them on your interview show 

1575
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,521
is mostly in the UK where they're 
pretending to be more benign than they 

1576
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:37,110
are.
And that module is,

1577
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:42,120
you know,
finding the question that sort of pulls 

1578
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:42,830
back the mask on the theocrat and it's 
hilarious.

1579
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:46,580
It's very funny that one video that you 
publish on your blog.

1580
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:51,680
I've sent to dozens of my friends that 
one video where there's this guy and is 

1581
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:56,550
addressing this enormous group of people
and he's talking about is this radical 

1582
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:58,790
Islam or Islam?
That was a conference in Norway.

1583
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,450
That was just,
I mean,

1584
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:05,750
just straight up in Islamic jihadist 
addressing a crowd of seemingly 

1585
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:07,850
mainstream Muslims in Norway,
but he,

1586
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:09,260
just by,
by show of hands,

1587
01:18:09,261 --> 01:18:09,860
you know,
is it,

1588
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:13,050
are we extremists if we think apostates 
should be killed,

1589
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:16,140
it's pretty stunning.
It's an amazing document.

1590
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,890
Yeah.
In respect to the way they want to treat

1591
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,480
homosexuals apostates,
I mean,

1592
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:26,530
the whole thing is,
is this Islam or is this radical Islam 

1593
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:28,250
talking of ideology,
blinkering statistical data,

1594
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,410
um,
on the subject of homosexuality.

1595
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:34,730
So in the United Kingdom,
a poll was done last year asking,

1596
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,310
so there've been two poles gauging 
public Muslim attitudes towards gays.

1597
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:44,810
Uh,
the first asked how many Muslims in the 

1598
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,350
UK find homosexuality is morally 
acceptable and zero percent.

1599
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:50,150
This is by the way,
by professional polling companies,

1600
01:18:50,151 --> 01:18:52,820
not just some student that's devised a 
poll on twitter.

1601
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:58,240
A professional polling company found 
zero percent of British Muslims 

1602
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,040
responded to a poll saying that they 
found homosexuality morally acceptable.

1603
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:03,380
And then a year later,
which now last year,

1604
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:05,870
another poll a was a,
was conducted.

1605
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,110
And,
uh,

1606
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:12,130
that was a,
an ICM poll asking where the British 

1607
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:16,031
Muslims,
how many British Muslims believe that 

1608
01:19:16,031 --> 01:19:16,430
homosexuality should be criminalized or 
remain legal.

1609
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:17,990
And,
uh,

1610
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:23,320
I think it was roughly 52 percent,
52 percent if my memory serves me 

1611
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,681
correctly,
said of British Muslims said that they 

1612
01:19:26,681 --> 01:19:26,681
would wish for homosexuality to be 
criminalized.

1613
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:31,840
And of course,
what does criminalization of 

1614
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,170
homosexuality mean under shadier and a 
traditional Islamic jurisprudence,

1615
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:38,290
we know that it's punished by death.
So these are these,

1616
01:19:38,331 --> 01:19:41,720
this is scientific data from gauging 
know attitudes,

1617
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:44,270
British Muslim attitudes towards 
homosexuality,

1618
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:49,630
but the ideological blinkers will,
will kick in and refuse to see that 

1619
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:49,800
truth.
And these aren't Islamists.

1620
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:51,140
Unfortunately,
my dialogue with Sam,

1621
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:56,141
we talk about this,
that there are the Islamists who wants 

1622
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:56,141
to,
who actively want to take over a country

1623
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:58,790
and enforce their version of Islam.
Then there's underneath that there's a,

1624
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:02,330
a softer landing of very,
very conservative stroke,

1625
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:05,900
fundamentalist attitudes that 
unfortunately have become widespread.

1626
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,010
And here is an example of that is that

1627
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
is being gauged by scientific polling 
methodology that tells us there's a 

1628
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,190
problem.
And unfortunately,

1629
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:18,720
if one were to speak in this way,
especially in Europe,

1630
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:24,380
one is received by my own political 
tribe and that's liberals center left 

1631
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:29,750
and further,
one is a met with denial and called a 

1632
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:33,861
bigot simply for relaying these facts.
A quarter of British Muslims when asked 

1633
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:40,011
about the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo 
offices in Paris a quarter said that 

1634
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:45,681
those attacks are justifiable.
They sympathize with the attackers as 

1635
01:20:45,681 --> 01:20:47,670
opposed to the victims who were the 
staff at the Charlie Hebdo offices.

1636
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:52,730
So this is what led you to be put on the
southern Harvard speaking in these 

1637
01:20:54,001 --> 01:20:54,410
terms.
And,

1638
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,730
and unfortunately it's reporting polling
data.

1639
01:20:56,731 --> 01:21:01,731
And what it does for me is to say this 
is why it's so important to address 

1640
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:01,830
these issues,
to have these conversations,

1641
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:07,490
to try and empower those Muslim voices 
that are seeking to challenge this sort 

1642
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:08,320
of,
these sorts of attitudes and,

1643
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,930
and carve out a space.

1644
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:10,450
And if,
if,

1645
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:15,900
if,
if one can do that with Catholicism in 

1646
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,681
Europe and,
and go through a reformation and end up 

1647
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:18,681
with an enlightenment and end up with 
secularism in the West.

1648
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:23,540
Um,
what I often say is American liberals 

1649
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,170
are very happy,
challenging their own Bible belt and yet

1650
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:30,171
we have a Koran belt within our 
communities and if I'm attempting to 

1651
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:33,981
replicate the equivalent of challenging 
the Bible belt within Muslim 

1652
01:21:33,981 --> 01:21:35,370
communities,
it means addressing these issues and yet

1653
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:40,050
they grant to themselves the right to 
challenge the Bible belt within America.

1654
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:45,380
And yet if we were to challenge what I 
call the Koran belt in Europe were 

1655
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:48,120
suddenly called bigots.
Islamophobes is this,

1656
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:52,920
is this static has been moving.
Has it been adjusting and changing?

1657
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:56,250
Is there any sort of a recognition that 
there's an issue with this?

1658
01:21:56,490 --> 01:22:01,490
So you know,
the emergence of Isis really did bring 

1659
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,270
it to the fore and it really did quiet 
and some of the voices.

1660
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:08,270
It also did increase the hysteria from 
the far left because they began 

1661
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:12,230
panicking thinking,
actually we're going to lose this 

1662
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,301
debate.
And that's where I noticed their 

1663
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:16,021
labeling became even stronger.
But the emergence of Isis did wake up a 

1664
01:22:16,021 --> 01:22:17,880
lot of people to,
to the challenges we're facing here.

1665
01:22:17,881 --> 01:22:21,810
Because so many European born and raised
Muslims went over to join isis.

1666
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,490
And of course,
think about it in this sense,

1667
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:28,491
the most infamous notorious execution 
sell that I think were erroneously 

1668
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:33,000
called the jihadi beetles in the press 
because actually it really does,

1669
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:38,720
it's an insult to the Beatles,
but it was a diminishes the true horror 

1670
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:38,720
of these guys,
you know,

1671
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,980
they call him jihadi John and,
but the isis executioners basically that

1672
01:22:40,981 --> 01:22:45,981
entire cell of the media,
face of ics execution cell were all 

1673
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:51,081
British Muslims.
And that should tell you something that 

1674
01:22:51,081 --> 01:22:51,081
we've got the worst terrorist group 
educator.

1675
01:22:51,081 --> 01:22:52,140
I mean,
the thing is at university graduate,

1676
01:22:52,141 --> 01:22:57,141
like every variable that the far left 
wants to marshal to explain this 

1677
01:22:57,141 --> 01:22:59,550
phenomenon,
like lack of educational opportunity,

1678
01:22:59,551 --> 01:23:02,400
lack of economic opportunity,
lack of social integration,

1679
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,070
mental illness.
Uh,

1680
01:23:04,071 --> 01:23:04,590
you,
you can,

1681
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,100
you find people

1682
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,240
who had massive opportunity.
I mean,

1683
01:23:08,241 --> 01:23:09,240
it's a bit like you were,
I mean,

1684
01:23:09,241 --> 01:23:11,080
you weren't a jihadist,
but you are an Islamist.

1685
01:23:11,081 --> 01:23:16,081
But let me,
you're a person who can basically play 

1686
01:23:16,081 --> 01:23:16,081
in a game.
He wanted me here.

1687
01:23:16,081 --> 01:23:16,280
You got to get his.
He's,

1688
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:21,300
he's,
he's somebody who backed to the 

1689
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:21,300
superman.
He can run,

1690
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:21,640
he can run for political office.
He hasn't been elected yet,

1691
01:23:21,641 --> 01:23:22,210
but he,
you know,

1692
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:23,380
he should be.
I mean,

1693
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:26,920
this is the quarterback of the football 
team

1694
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:31,720
in this context is a candidate for 
recruitment.

1695
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:33,220
We'll think of.
Think of it this way.

1696
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:35,890
We've got the the worst terrorist group 
in our lifetime.

1697
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:37,980
It one can reasonably say,
is Isis right though?

1698
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:39,760
The worst terrorist group,
at least in living memory,

1699
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:45,120
is isis and the worst cell nrcs,
the execution cell came from a fully 

1700
01:23:46,511 --> 01:23:49,420
developed,
for want of a better term,

1701
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:52,490
first world country,
and that was Britain and Mohammed.

1702
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:54,490
I'm was he the leader of that execution.
Sell,

1703
01:23:54,491 --> 01:23:56,380
graduated from the University of 
Westminster,

1704
01:23:56,381 --> 01:24:01,381
was given as a young child was given 
political asylum by Britain because his 

1705
01:24:01,381 --> 01:24:04,870
family were Kuwaiti and they fled the 
invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein,

1706
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:09,640
the country that the west liberated and 
he turned against that country.

1707
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,760
So he had every reason to like Britain.
Britain gave my home,

1708
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:15,610
gave him a actually physically bricks 
and mortar house,

1709
01:24:15,611 --> 01:24:18,610
gave his family on social costs.
They gave him social housing.

1710
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:23,970
They educated and he graduated from 
university and they liberated his 

1711
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:26,440
father's country from an aggressor.
And this man turned against this country

1712
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:28,360
that helped him and his family and his 
nation.

1713
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,120
Was he captured or did he go?
He's dead.

1714
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:34,740
One of them has been captured,
but he's currently being held in Turkey.

1715
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:38,410
It would be fascinating to listen to his
rationale.

1716
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,280
Well,
it's not that the other one,

1717
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:42,230
I forgot his name,
but he was just interviewing tim.

1718
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:47,290
Did you don't get a lot out of him.
He was interviewed by female Arab 

1719
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:47,850
journalist.
No,

1720
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,440
that was.
And so on.

1721
01:24:50,441 --> 01:24:52,400
And dismissive character.
Yeah.

1722
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:52,750
Yeah.
He,

1723
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:54,260
he,
he refused to talk about March.

1724
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:54,780
He said,
uh,

1725
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:59,850
you know,
these are accu accusations and 

1726
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:00,050
allegations you're making and I will 
wait to trial.

1727
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,600
In the end,
he kind of cut the interview short.

1728
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,310
He seemed a little put out that she was.

1729
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:05,520
Oh yeah,
he did.

1730
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:06,770
So it says,
I'm looking at you now.

1731
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,440
Imagine she's the interview and she's 
asking me questions and I'm looking at

1732
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,760
direction in your direction.
He literally never laid eyes on her and 

1733
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,780
it was bad nlp.
It's so intense and it's such,

1734
01:25:23,941 --> 01:25:24,270
it,
like,

1735
01:25:24,271 --> 01:25:27,480
as you say,
radioactive subject to it's,

1736
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:32,650
it's just fascinating to watch white 
liberal progressives just scamper away 

1737
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:34,170
from this.
But the flip,

1738
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:39,210
the flip side of the Isis thing has been
the refugee crisis which has made,

1739
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:42,750
which has really empowered both extremes
frankly,

1740
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,360
that the far left and the far right so 
you have the far right.

1741
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:50,880
You are obviously with the wind in their
sails worrying about this influx of 

1742
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,860
people from the Middle East and,
and you know,

1743
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:57,020
and beyond North Africa,
uh,

1744
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:02,360
and just the change of culture in their 
societies and a lot of these concerns 

1745
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,070
are plausible,
but because only

1746
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:09,070
the far right and a few other decent 
people like Douglas Murray will talk 

1747
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:11,330
about the plausible concerns.
Uh,

1748
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:14,450
the space has just been vacated.
So you just have the far right,

1749
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:15,800
far,
far right,

1750
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:20,801
populous politics being enabled and then
you have this delusional open borders 

1751
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:22,890
left that won't.
Uh,

1752
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:26,420
we talked about the problem that I told 
Sam about this,

1753
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:28,070
but it bears repeating.
Um,

1754
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:33,390
I was having a conversation with someone
as an executive at Youtube and I asked 

1755
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:36,641
them why someone got a community 
guideline strike on their account 

1756
01:26:36,641 --> 01:26:40,250
because they posted up a video on their 
playlist that they enjoyed of Sam Harris

1757
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,950
and Douglas Murray engaged in a 
conversation.

1758
01:26:42,951 --> 01:26:43,580
I'm like,
I go,

1759
01:26:43,581 --> 01:26:47,090
why would that get you a community 
guideline strike in?

1760
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:48,710
This woman said,
because it's hate speech.

1761
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,560
I got a problem with the last name,
Maria.

1762
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,950
Apparently Maria Douglas Murray causing 
me problems.

1763
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:57,080
Somebody worked.
She was a big executive at Youtube.

1764
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,700
She said,
it's hate speech.

1765
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:00,050
And I told her,
I go,

1766
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:01,310
did you listen to it?
I go,

1767
01:27:01,311 --> 01:27:02,120
you didn't listen to it.
I go,

1768
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:07,121
this is stunning that you would just say
it's hate speech that you just be so 

1769
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:11,141
dismissive of it so quickly.
And she talked to me as if I was her 

1770
01:27:11,141 --> 01:27:14,861
employee.
Like I was not allowed to question her 

1771
01:27:14,861 --> 01:27:15,110
and she was just going to say what she 
said and I was going to shut up.

1772
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:20,270
And it was a fascinating conversation.
I know this is no lie on vacation.

1773
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:20,720
No,
but it was.

1774
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:24,590
I did a podcast with Douglas and 
apparently it got flagged.

1775
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:29,890
Someone else put it up on their account 
and I got flagged as hate speech and so 

1776
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:30,960
strikes you can get your account 
removed.

1777
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:31,510
I've

1778
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:36,510
got a phrase for this and I'd been.
I'd been rallying for it on on social 

1779
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:38,890
media for a couple of months now and I 
call it a a digital blind spot.

1780
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:43,660
There's a cultural bias on social media 
where because of,

1781
01:27:43,661 --> 01:27:48,661
and it's intellectually lazy because 
because social media is essentially a 

1782
01:27:48,661 --> 01:27:48,661
California and invention,
right,

1783
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:52,320
and we're in the home state of where 
most of this came from it.

1784
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:57,620
It's got a very Californian based 
worldview which cares a lot about white 

1785
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:01,861
supremacy and doesn't care about many 
other forms of bigotry that exists out 

1786
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:05,761
there in the rest of the world,
which by the way is the majority of the 

1787
01:28:05,761 --> 01:28:05,761
world.
So on twitter right now,

1788
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:08,470
of course there's A.
Miley Annapolis has been banned.

1789
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:14,070
Tommy Robinson has been burned as in 
taking off now twitter is a private 

1790
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:17,301
Tommy Robinson.
He's the former leader of the British 

1791
01:28:17,301 --> 01:28:20,460
English Defense League,
which was at one time Europe's largest 

1792
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:20,650
anti Muslim street protest group.

1793
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:25,830
I helped him leave that organization is 
still what many views I completely 

1794
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:28,861
disagree with,
but nevertheless he doesn't support or 

1795
01:28:28,861 --> 01:28:29,860
nor advocate for terrorism.
Why was he removed?

1796
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:31,210
Well,
so twitter,

1797
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,610
twitter is a private company.
It can choose to remove whoever it wants

1798
01:28:33,611 --> 01:28:38,611
for whatever reason,
and we'll judge it for his 

1799
01:28:38,611 --> 01:28:40,030
inconsistencies.
But he was ostensibly removed for hate 

1800
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:40,030
speech,
as was minor Eunapolis.

1801
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:43,780
Now,
the point being that still till this day

1802
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:48,870
and before people misquote me and 
completely say that I'm now defending 

1803
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,880
hate speech and,
and it's a and their right to speak with

1804
01:28:51,881 --> 01:28:56,881
hateful views on twitter.
This is my actual point that til this 

1805
01:28:56,881 --> 01:29:00,031
day did you know that Hezbollah,
which is a known and recognized 

1806
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:02,760
terrorist organization,
so forget hate speech for a moment,

1807
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:08,240
a terrorist organization that believes 
in actually killing civilians and Hamas,

1808
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:13,730
a known and recognized terrorist 
organization that believes in bombing 

1809
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:15,030
babies on buses as a form of resistance.

1810
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,990
They still have accounts on twitter.
Um,

1811
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,460
and,
and,

1812
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:19,780
and my point is,
is that this is the,

1813
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:24,830
this is the blind spot that I've flagged
twitter about this on many an occasion.

1814
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,640
This is the cultural blind spot.
This is the digital blind spot that the,

1815
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:33,300
the dude sitting in California in 
wherever who is monitoring this stuff,

1816
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:37,050
and it's probably more than one person.
They don't give a shit that there's some

1817
01:29:37,051 --> 01:29:42,051
brown person in the Gaza Strip that 
believes it's okay to kill Jewish 

1818
01:29:42,121 --> 01:29:47,121
babies.
They don't give a shit because it's a 

1819
01:29:47,121 --> 01:29:47,121
brown person saying it in the name of 
Islam.

1820
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:52,130
What they care about is a nonviolent yet
says stupid things guy because he's 

1821
01:29:52,681 --> 01:29:55,170
white,
called Tommy Robinson in England or Milo

1822
01:29:55,170 --> 01:30:00,170
Yiannopoulos,
saying stuff that they obviously that 

1823
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:02,631
touches their sensitivities and it's so 
intellectually lazy to flag that 

1824
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:06,951
immediately and to borrow it from social
media because you're comfortable with 

1825
01:30:06,951 --> 01:30:06,951
it.

1826
01:30:06,951 --> 01:30:10,340
You recognize white supremacy.
It doesn't take any effort to recognize 

1827
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:13,671
it.
You don't have to invest in studying 

1828
01:30:13,671 --> 01:30:13,671
this stuff to know what white supremacy 
is.

1829
01:30:13,671 --> 01:30:17,810
It takes a bit of effort to study Brown 
peoples ideas that you're unfamiliar 

1830
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:22,611
with and recognize.
Here's a terrorist organization that's 

1831
01:30:22,611 --> 01:30:23,730
freely operating on social media.
I know specifically on twitter,

1832
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:27,270
I've actually pulled up their handles.
I think one of the concerns that twitter

1833
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:29,250
has,
and I think this is a valid concern,

1834
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:34,280
is that when you have people that are 
saying hateful things and you have 

1835
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:35,460
people that are saying whether it's 
white supremacy or whatever,

1836
01:30:35,461 --> 01:30:40,461
even if it's stupid,
the problem is there is a rallying cry 

1837
01:30:40,461 --> 01:30:44,931
of trolls that follow behind them and it
builds up momentum and it gets pretty 

1838
01:30:44,931 --> 01:30:49,311
stunning and that was what was happening
with Milo and by silencing Milo off 

1839
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:54,261
twitter.
They have essentially removed him from 

1840
01:30:54,261 --> 01:30:54,261
the public discourse.

1841
01:30:54,261 --> 01:30:57,570
You don't hear about him anymore because
of this because of these things,

1842
01:30:57,630 --> 01:30:59,790
but imagine what that does in Arabic 
with the terrorist groups.

1843
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:06,050
Everything you've just said,
by the way I agree with and multiply 

1844
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:09,141
that for groups that have infrastructure
in multiple countries with actual 

1845
01:31:09,141 --> 01:31:11,940
organizational hierarchies and plan 
means of distributing,

1846
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:14,940
distributing their ideas across entire 
populations,

1847
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,150
physically fighting in wars right now 
such as Hezbollah and Syria,

1848
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,490
killing Sunni Muslim rebels,
you know,

1849
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:25,690
and so imagine that and the and the way 
you are able to rally a mob in Pakistan 

1850
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:26,610
on blast,
for me as an example,

1851
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:31,790
all it takes for some personal and 
social media to accuse and other 

1852
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:34,370
personal blast for me and they're 
probably going to get killed the very 

1853
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:34,370
next day and it happens all the time.
But,

1854
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:38,160
but because these Californian based 
social media companies are unaware of,

1855
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:43,550
of the,
of the cultural implications of those 

1856
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:43,550
sorts of organizations and groups and 
listed terrorist groups.

1857
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,450
Mind you,
they are this completely.

1858
01:31:45,451 --> 01:31:47,490
No,
no barring on any of their activity.

1859
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:52,730
There's also the same thing that you 
have with youtube and with a lot of 

1860
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:56,031
these other social media organizations 
and companies is they don't have to 

1861
01:31:56,041 --> 01:32:00,220
respond or give you any reasons.
They can say it violates

1862
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,410
our terms,
but what are those terms?

1863
01:32:02,411 --> 01:32:04,210
Those terms aren't even listed.
It will be vague,

1864
01:32:04,211 --> 01:32:05,440
like no hate speech.
Okay.

1865
01:32:05,441 --> 01:32:07,930
Well what's hate speech?
Like what do you say?

1866
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,490
Like what is.
What are you,

1867
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,010
what is your clear policy?
What are your guidelines?

1868
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:14,860
How does someone avoid violating your 
guidelines?

1869
01:32:14,861 --> 01:32:19,861
They don't say,
and how is the president of the United 

1870
01:32:19,861 --> 01:32:22,320
States not nonviolent?
Violating those demonetization is 

1871
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,281
another way that they do it.
They'll remove the ability to put 

1872
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:26,281
advertising on,
on,

1873
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:30,220
on a conversation that they don't like 
and it doesn't have to be like my 

1874
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,470
conversation with Douglas Murray was 
demonic d without any explanation.

1875
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:33,610
None.
Zero.

1876
01:32:33,611 --> 01:32:35,140
They don't have to.
Douglas is,

1877
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,760
he's talking to this kid.
He's a hundred percent.

1878
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,820
Yeah,
but if you listen to our act,

1879
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:44,800
the actual context of our conversation,
there was nothing even remotely remotely

1880
01:32:44,801 --> 01:32:45,950
hateful about it.
Yeah.

1881
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:51,210
Yeah.
I mean these are probably the companies 

1882
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:51,210
they've got the right to,
to choose what are the policy.

1883
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:55,560
The only thing I would expect from a 
private company is show a consistent 

1884
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:55,560
policy tools.
These things,

1885
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,880
you know,
if you don't like hate speech than Brown

1886
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:02,880
band Brown people who were also 
advocating more than just the hate 

1887
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:02,880
speech,
but actually preaching volunteerism.

1888
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,400
Right,
right.

1889
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:05,860
Yeah.
It's a strange time for this man because

1890
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:10,861
it's also a time where you can 
communicate so instantaneously.

1891
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:14,650
It's fantastic in that regard.
You can get ideas out so quickly,

1892
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:19,651
but these hubs of information like where
the information gets distributed are,

1893
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:26,310
are controlled by people that I don't 
think ever knew that they were going to 

1894
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,550
have this sort of responsibility.
I don't think.

1895
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:30,840
I think you're seeing that with 
Zuckerberg and these trials were the,

1896
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:31,360
the,
the,

1897
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:33,460
the speeches that he's given in front of
Congress.

1898
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,130
Like when you see him on television 
talking about it,

1899
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:40,270
you get the sense that this is a guy 
that never prepared for this had no idea

1900
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:45,271
this was going to happen,
and then all of a sudden from this 

1901
01:33:45,271 --> 01:33:48,390
simple social media platform that was 
supposed to be friends sharing photos 

1902
01:33:48,551 --> 01:33:52,570
and just talking about girls not set up 
to put women.

1903
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,040
There was a lot of that,
you know,

1904
01:33:54,210 --> 01:33:55,600
but I've been to,
and what was twitter?

1905
01:33:55,601 --> 01:33:57,220
I mean twitter was essentially just,
you know,

1906
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:57,880
uh,
I mean,

1907
01:33:57,881 --> 01:34:00,160
do you remember the old days of twitter?
It would be,

1908
01:34:00,161 --> 01:34:05,161
you would use your name like is doing 
this,

1909
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:06,970
like sam,
Sam Harris,

1910
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:10,300
like Sam Harris is at the movies.
You would say that almost if you were in

1911
01:34:10,301 --> 01:34:15,301
a third person that was the original 
form that people would use twitter come 

1912
01:34:15,301 --> 01:34:15,400
after that.
It was weird.

1913
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:20,430
It was a weird way of talking and then 
people started just writing what they 

1914
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:25,380
thought and it just became and then 
became ideology and then it became a 

1915
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:30,510
sharing links,
sharing links and interesting articles 

1916
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:30,510
is a big part of it.
But this,

1917
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:33,520
to me that's the only good part of it 
now.

1918
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:38,521
Like I,
like I've just discovered that and that 

1919
01:34:38,521 --> 01:34:41,320
was most of my attachment to it.
I mean I genuinely use it to,

1920
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:41,990
as a,
as,

1921
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:42,780
as,
as,

1922
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:45,340
as a curator of newspapers.
I follow interesting people,

1923
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:48,850
they they tweet interesting stuff and I 
and I consume it that way,

1924
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,600
but noticing what's coming back at me in
the Atlantis.

1925
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:57,610
I put something out,
know a podcast and then I looked to see 

1926
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:58,070
it's being received on

1927
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:01,640
twitter and I don't tend to do that in 
other forums.

1928
01:35:01,641 --> 01:35:03,800
I don't really look at facebook comments
much.

1929
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:06,970
I don't look at Youtube or Youtube 
assessable.

1930
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:07,530
Right.
I mean,

1931
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:10,220
so even if they're for you that the 
comments are horrible,

1932
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:13,280
why is that?
I don't.

1933
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:17,590
It's been started on the youtube 
comment.

1934
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,640
Friends.
It's spread everywhere else.

1935
01:35:19,641 --> 01:35:20,650
It's very strange but.
So I.

1936
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:25,750
But one thing I found that you can 
change your settings and twitter where 

1937
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:27,200
you,
you a screen out,

1938
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:30,740
people who don't have a twitter egg 
photos,

1939
01:35:30,741 --> 01:35:35,741
they don't have a real photo.
You can screen out people who haven't 

1940
01:35:35,741 --> 01:35:38,291
had their email confirmed and I think I 
just did those two things and like 90 

1941
01:35:39,261 --> 01:35:41,060
percent of the hate went away.
It was amazing.

1942
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:43,380
Like it just,
just doing that just.

1943
01:35:43,381 --> 01:35:45,350
It was amazing.
Thank you for that.

1944
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:46,950
You should do that.
Except I'm.

1945
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:51,200
I think it's better to not actually even
look at what's coming back at.

1946
01:35:51,201 --> 01:35:52,790
You would have taken it off your phone?
No,

1947
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,850
I think so too.
I think looking,

1948
01:35:54,851 --> 01:35:59,851
looking at it,
my wife Rachel will be very happy with 

1949
01:35:59,851 --> 01:36:03,281
that and then she should.
I think she'd probably wish that I did 

1950
01:36:03,281 --> 01:36:03,710
tweak on it to.
Do you read things and get angry?

1951
01:36:03,711 --> 01:36:03,740
I'm,

1952
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,660
I don't,
I don't react sometimes.

1953
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,520
I like to think I don't react in this 
way,

1954
01:36:07,521 --> 01:36:12,521
but I mean I can't,
I can't say that because actually 

1955
01:36:12,521 --> 01:36:12,521
probably I have some times,
but you know,

1956
01:36:12,521 --> 01:36:15,100
I get all that same kind of.
It's interesting because I took,

1957
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:18,560
I took a stance on the Syria strikes.
And what was your stance?

1958
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:20,020
Well,
I just think that um,

1959
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,370
uh,
especially now in hindsight,

1960
01:36:22,371 --> 01:36:24,590
were there no,
no casualties involved at all.

1961
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:29,720
There were only three injuries.
I think we had to take a stance that 

1962
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:34,330
succeeded where Obama failed in,
in making sure that red line was 

1963
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:37,451
maintained,
that the use of chemical weapons cannot 

1964
01:36:37,451 --> 01:36:39,940
be tolerated.
Even if it was symbolic even it was 

1965
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:42,231
highly symbolic.
I think sometimes symbolism is 

1966
01:36:42,231 --> 01:36:42,231
important.
So I took that stance and uh,

1967
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,210
it got a lot of love on twitter.
Well,

1968
01:36:44,211 --> 01:36:44,540
yeah,
of course,

1969
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:45,830
because that's actually,
that's against the grain.

1970
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:48,260
A public opinion at the moment is it was
against the strikes,

1971
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:49,970
so fully acknowledged that when I took 
the stance,

1972
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,530
but I argued a case and I set the case 
out in both on my sky news show.

1973
01:36:54,531 --> 01:36:59,531
I have a show,
I'm a cohost on the pledge and also on 

1974
01:36:59,531 --> 01:37:02,231
my radio show and LBC.
I repeatedly argued for why I think is 

1975
01:37:02,231 --> 01:37:03,630
important that we don't allow for 
chemical weapons and they used to become

1976
01:37:03,631 --> 01:37:05,270
militarized in our world.
Um,

1977
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:10,320
and so it was interesting because I 
posted the Sky News clip of me sort of 

1978
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,640
talking to camera about my reasons for 
this and the.

1979
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:12,300
And,
and uh,

1980
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:16,610
I have this screen grab of the reaction.
It's actually hilarious.

1981
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:20,210
It's just a puddle of blood.
It is the two extremes.

1982
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:24,550
They actually started fighting with each
other about who's right about there.

1983
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:25,530
So obviously,
look,

1984
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,600
here's a clip,
why we must intervene in Syria after 

1985
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,291
that chemical that blah blah.
The first one is a guy with an actual 

1986
01:37:32,291 --> 01:37:32,960
swastika Nazi symbol on his profile is,
is wonderful,

1987
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:33,810
and it says,
you know,

1988
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:36,680
at Nordic Scott is is handled Thomas 
James,

1989
01:37:36,681 --> 01:37:41,681
he says,
Magid wants Britain to intervene in 

1990
01:37:41,681 --> 01:37:42,890
Syria because Putin and acid are kicking
his isis buddies office's end of story.

1991
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,300
Right?
So there's the guys basically saying,

1992
01:37:44,301 --> 01:37:49,301
but my real reason for calling for that 
is because I'm supporting isis against 

1993
01:37:49,301 --> 01:37:52,301
the regime.
The guy immediately often responds to 

1994
01:37:52,301 --> 01:37:53,870
him and it's called [inaudible] and he 
says,

1995
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:56,180
what do you want about Nancy Demoss?

1996
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,350
Magid is funded by.
Your law is a far right.

1997
01:37:58,351 --> 01:38:02,190
Uncle Tom.
So they're fighting with each other.

1998
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,280
They actually,
no,

1999
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:07,560
this is a captures that,
but they're arguing with each other over

2000
01:38:07,561 --> 01:38:11,520
whether I'm in his camp or his camp.
The far right and the far left,

2001
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,580
basically you didn't have the words 
publicists in the world or the best one.

2002
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:16,940
So I should take myself out of that 
equation.

2003
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,210
Let them fight each other.
It would be even better.

2004
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:18,640
Really.
It,

2005
01:38:18,641 --> 01:38:23,641
that's the move to set something like 
that upset the far right and the far 

2006
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:27,711
left against each other.
And you can just sneak away while 

2007
01:38:27,711 --> 01:38:28,560
they're fighting.
That's how nuts it is.

2008
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:32,640
The twitter kind of horses,
the extremes are,

2009
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:37,700
are um,
I mean they're equally irrational and 

2010
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:40,630
the fact that you could be at the 
epicenter of,

2011
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:43,570
of each prompt a both of their problems.
Yeah.

2012
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:48,620
That you're,
you're a covert jihadist and you're an 

2013
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,501
anti Muslim bigot.
It seems like there's more conspiracy 

2014
01:38:51,501 --> 01:38:55,131
theories in terms of like what someone's
actual motivation for what they're 

2015
01:38:55,131 --> 01:38:57,420
saying now than ever before to because 
it's so easy to express them.

2016
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:58,830
So someone could say,
no,

2017
01:38:58,831 --> 01:39:00,480
you know,
he's far right or no,

2018
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:01,220
you're,
you're,

2019
01:39:01,221 --> 01:39:03,690
you're just trying to support isis like 
this.

2020
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:08,430
This is this ability to like find some 
nefarious reason for your actions.

2021
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:13,450
But again,
it's reducing one's opinion to the 

2022
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:13,450
lowest base,
you know,

2023
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:15,750
dodgy motive as opposed to applying the 
principle of charity.

2024
01:39:15,751 --> 01:39:19,380
So if joe says something now I can 
either sit here and actually think,

2025
01:39:19,381 --> 01:39:20,610
no,
I don't trust this guy,

2026
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:24,150
I don't respect him and therefore I'm 
going to reduce his opinion to the worst

2027
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:26,640
possible interpretation that he could 
possibly mean.

2028
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:30,960
And then use that against him.
Or I could continue to ask what you mean

2029
01:39:30,961 --> 01:39:32,520
by that because I'm assuming you're a 
good,

2030
01:39:32,521 --> 01:39:37,521
decent human being in origin and perhaps
you mean something that I haven't yet 

2031
01:39:37,521 --> 01:39:37,521
quite grasped.

2032
01:39:37,521 --> 01:39:41,600
And then I'll ask you,
clarify your own opinion in your own 

2033
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,911
words.
And I think it's unfortunate that many 

2034
01:39:43,911 --> 01:39:45,420
of our conversations today in the far 
left is as guilty of it as the far right

2035
01:39:45,421 --> 01:39:48,450
and they like to think they're not,
which is part of that righteousness that

2036
01:39:48,451 --> 01:39:51,390
blinds them from actually committing 
this very same injustice.

2037
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:52,770
They accused the far right of 
committing.

2038
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:53,540
And that is,
uh,

2039
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:56,280
uh,
it's the same bigotry in a mirror image,

2040
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:58,110
I call it the bigotry of low 
expectations.

2041
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:03,380
The low expectations they have that 
Muslims are somehow unable to adhere to 

2042
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:03,380
common,
decent liberal,

2043
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:08,121
secular democratic values.
And so it's actually a plaguing our 

2044
01:40:08,121 --> 01:40:12,351
conversations if only we were able to 
strip away our ideological baggage in 

2045
01:40:12,351 --> 01:40:14,250
entering conversations and,
and allow for,

2046
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:15,330
you know,
that honest,

2047
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:20,420
honest conversation.
But of course we say that and then you 

2048
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:23,151
try to replicate our success in a number
of occasions and found yourself 

2049
01:40:23,151 --> 01:40:24,300
incredibly frustrated while you are one 
more time.

2050
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:26,610
Well,
it's unfortunate.

2051
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:28,860
I found the one reasonable person to 
have a fight with.

2052
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,430
Well,
it just seems like this is a side effect

2053
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:37,431
of this increased ability to communicate
and that there's so much noise and 

2054
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,910
there's so much going on.
I mean,

2055
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,210
it's just the most fantastic time for 
the distribution of information.

2056
01:40:42,211 --> 01:40:47,211
There's never been a time where it's so 
easy to distribute information in human 

2057
01:40:47,211 --> 01:40:47,211
history.
It's really crazy.

2058
01:40:47,211 --> 01:40:48,330
But I don't think we know what to do 
with it.

2059
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:53,570
And I think when you deal with people 
who have such rigid ideologies and they 

2060
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:54,520
this incredibly

2061
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,070
easy ability to express these 
ideologies,

2062
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,620
there's just so much clashing.
It was just so much,

2063
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:04,830
so much noise and nonsense.
And when someone says something that 

2064
01:41:04,901 --> 01:41:09,901
they know that they don't have to back 
up with facts because they know that 

2065
01:41:09,901 --> 01:41:09,901
they're there,
people were on their position,

2066
01:41:09,901 --> 01:41:11,400
will support it.
You say the right keywords,

2067
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:12,910
you know,
white privilege,

2068
01:41:12,911 --> 01:41:15,340
whatever you want to say.
And then boom,

2069
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:19,020
you're going to get a whole slew of 
people like those two people in your,

2070
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,190
your mentions battling it out with each 
other.

2071
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:26,400
You're just like kind of picking fights 
and starting these little fires and 

2072
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,400
letting other people to

2073
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,130
go to war.
You know what I think we've done,

2074
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:32,160
and it's again,
the advent of social media is that we 

2075
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,580
are speaking with my friend mark about 
this and we've democratized truth and 

2076
01:41:34,931 --> 01:41:39,931
when you democratize truth in that way,
the earlier thing you mentioned about 

2077
01:41:39,971 --> 01:41:44,971
sports,
combat sports and your expertise in 

2078
01:41:44,971 --> 01:41:47,461
their field.
If I had come back at you and spoke at 

2079
01:41:47,461 --> 01:41:50,941
you with as much authority as you claim 
in your expertise with having absolutely

2080
01:41:51,101 --> 01:41:56,101
no history in that expertise whatsoever 
and assumed that I have as equal right 

2081
01:41:56,261 --> 01:42:00,460
to an unresearched claim to truth in my 
opinion,

2082
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:04,780
as you do and who has a lifetime of 
experience in that field.

2083
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:08,230
There in lies a problem that I'm 
aggregating to myself.

2084
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,490
This notion,
this,

2085
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:14,580
this,
this kind of belief that my opinion 

2086
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:17,450
though,
I of course have an equally legal right 

2087
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:19,681
to express it,
but it doesn't mean it carries the same 

2088
01:42:19,681 --> 01:42:19,681
weight as your opinion when it comes to 
combat sports and it shouldn't.

2089
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:24,900
Unfortunately,
I think what's happened with the advent 

2090
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,970
and worse still you could add your 
expressing that opinion as a person of 

2091
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:31,951
color as somehow therefore it's an 
criticizable by you because it's his 

2092
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:35,620
truth.
Otherwise you are racist and it's Mike.

2093
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:39,400
That's the key word that it's my truth 
and so the problem with that is when you

2094
01:42:39,401 --> 01:42:42,160
relativized truth in that way,
is that then I can speak to you on on an

2095
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:47,190
equal footing about combat sports,
which only a mad person who hasn't had 

2096
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:51,391
that history in comments.
What would think would aggregate to 

2097
01:42:51,391 --> 01:42:51,391
themselves,
right?

2098
01:42:51,391 --> 01:42:51,850
To do so,
but social media I think has allowed for

2099
01:42:51,851 --> 01:42:54,280
that to happen.
I gave a Ted talk in about,

2100
01:42:54,281 --> 01:42:59,281
I think it was roughly 2011 about the 
dangers of this happening in social 

2101
01:42:59,281 --> 01:42:59,300
media,
dividing us all,

2102
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:03,520
but I'd say now that if I were to pitch 
that Ted talk today,

2103
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:05,080
I did it at Ted Global.

2104
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:09,100
If I were to pitch that Ted talk today,
it wouldn't be accepted because it's not

2105
01:43:09,101 --> 01:43:14,101
something new now.
It's now people know that how social 

2106
01:43:14,101 --> 01:43:16,651
media is has divided us,
but back then it was new and innovative 

2107
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:21,120
enough as an idea for Ted global to say 
we want you to speak about this on and 

2108
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:21,550
it's still up online,
but if people watched it today,

2109
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:22,960
they think,
how on earth did that become a Ted talk?

2110
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:27,280
Because there was this heady day back 
in,

2111
01:43:27,281 --> 01:43:27,910
you know,
five,

2112
01:43:27,911 --> 01:43:28,810
six,
seven years ago,

2113
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:32,890
this kind of hope filled moment where 
everyone thought Google,

2114
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:37,920
facebook and twitter and generally 
social media and also tech companies 

2115
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:42,060
were like the good guys that these 
companies weren't actually companies 

2116
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:44,140
that they were on our side against the 
corporate world and it turns out.

2117
01:43:44,141 --> 01:43:46,300
I think we've just hit this moment.
You mentioned Zuckerberg.

2118
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:51,301
We,
I think we've culturally come to this 

2119
01:43:51,301 --> 01:43:51,800
moment now where think symbolized by his
testimony at Congress

2120
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,240
that those,
that,

2121
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,740
that,
that honeymoon period is over,

2122
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:59,770
people now view him,
I think quite firmly and squarely as a 

2123
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:03,881
ceo of a very rich company as opposed to
a guy in my club that I'm friends with 

2124
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:06,800
WHO's on my side against the world,
you know,

2125
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:07,800
and that's how,
you know,

2126
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:13,040
Google used to have that slogan,
don't do evil jumbly they still have it.

2127
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:19,280
I mean the problem is the incentives are
all wrong and so actually I was just at 

2128
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,130
Ted and will they give you a sense of 
how far the rod has spread here?

2129
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:27,131
So I was,
I found myself at a dinner sitting next 

2130
01:44:27,131 --> 01:44:29,741
to a neuroscientist who thought that 
this Ezra Klein thing followed me around

2131
01:44:32,581 --> 01:44:37,581
at Ted and it's because many people have
listened to the podcast and he thought 

2132
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:40,790
Charles Murray should have been 
physically attacked at Middlebury.

2133
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,860
This is a neuro as a neuroscientist.

2134
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:47,000
Academic was impeccable person.
Otherwise.

2135
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:48,230
I mean,
I think he was,

2136
01:44:48,231 --> 01:44:51,380
after we wound up having to fight a or a
dinner over it,

2137
01:44:51,381 --> 01:44:53,960
I think he was somewhat chagrined by 
having expressed that opinion,

2138
01:44:53,961 --> 01:44:55,430
but I mean,
that's how,

2139
01:44:55,460 --> 01:45:00,460
how emotionally hijacked people are by 
this issue and uh,

2140
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,160
but it's a,
um,

2141
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:03,710
that's incredible.
It was just.

2142
01:45:03,711 --> 01:45:05,750
Yeah,
it was the other thing that's new.

2143
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:08,870
This is the other thing that it's new.
The left advocating for violence.

2144
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:10,280
This is very new.
Yeah.

2145
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,000
Yeah.
I mean,

2146
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:15,320
I always felt like the left was a 
nonviolent.

2147
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:19,390
The whole idea behind being progressive,
like nonviolence was,

2148
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:23,880
was a genuine aspect of that.
And free speech to things.

2149
01:45:23,881 --> 01:45:25,640
Yeah.
Those are two things that have been sort

2150
01:45:25,641 --> 01:45:30,641
of stopped.
That free speech is fine as long as 

2151
01:45:30,641 --> 01:45:32,570
you're not saying speech that I disagree
with and nonviolence.

2152
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:35,330
Sure.
In less we need to use violence,

2153
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:37,420
which is in the people that are saying 
it.

2154
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:41,030
Like if you watch these anti for people 
like Jesus Christ,

2155
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:46,180
the most incompetent,
violent people you've ever seen in your 

2156
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:46,180
life.
It depends.

2157
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:46,760
It depends.
Your sensibility.

2158
01:45:46,761 --> 01:45:50,900
Does that ever make it funny?
You guys are terrible at it.

2159
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:56,110
There's videos of these guys practicing,
there's videos of Antifa they had got 

2160
01:45:56,541 --> 01:46:01,541
together and decided to train and 
prepare for violence and so they're 

2161
01:46:01,541 --> 01:46:05,471
doing these martial arts classes.
They have people teach them like holy 

2162
01:46:05,471 --> 01:46:08,801
shit,
like at the average high school kid 

2163
01:46:08,801 --> 01:46:11,351
could fuck you guys up.
Like this is the most ridiculous thing 

2164
01:46:11,351 --> 01:46:11,351
I've ever seen in my life,
but it's almost like they're.

2165
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:16,360
They realize that there's not that much 
danger in what they're doing and they 

2166
01:46:16,431 --> 01:46:19,460
can kind of play with danger.
They can play with violence.

2167
01:46:19,461 --> 01:46:21,770
They can put the masks on their,
you know,

2168
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:25,370
they're not in Israel.
They're out at the Gaza Strip.

2169
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:30,410
Are there a bunch of counts as a guy.
There's a guy who went to my old 

2170
01:46:30,410 --> 01:46:32,711
university I graduated from,
so asked before I did my masters at the 

2171
01:46:32,711 --> 01:46:35,681
NSC,
so as has been embroiled in a strike at 

2172
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:37,631
the moment as the student's union has 
been supporting professors who were on 

2173
01:46:37,631 --> 01:46:41,411
strike and it's over the pension and 
pension rights in refused government 

2174
01:46:41,411 --> 01:46:42,020
refusing to raise their pension rights 
and whatever,

2175
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:44,150
and some of the students came out and 
strike,

2176
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:47,350
fall up students defending the 
professors and they put,

2177
01:46:47,450 --> 01:46:49,920
they put forward a ring preventing from 
attending

2178
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:51,490
their classes and,
and,

2179
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:56,590
and a,
a female black lecturer wanted to cross 

2180
01:46:56,590 --> 01:47:00,981
the strike lines to go into teach her 
students a white male public school 

2181
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,140
educated,
very,

2182
01:47:04,141 --> 01:47:08,880
very middleclass protester far left,
physically attacked her.

2183
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:12,600
He physically attacked a female black 
professor.

2184
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,630
So gone is suddenly gone.
Is The white privilege gone?

2185
01:47:15,631 --> 01:47:17,520
Is the male attacking a female?
You know,

2186
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:20,640
gone is all of that non violence.
All the above.

2187
01:47:20,641 --> 01:47:25,641
The name of ideology he legitimized and 
allowed himself to attack a black 

2188
01:47:25,641 --> 01:47:26,160
female,
by the way.

2189
01:47:26,161 --> 01:47:27,270
Oh.
And she was also Muslim,

2190
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,050
so she,
when she went into the prep,

2191
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:36,410
he would've had the right Sheila.
She actually said that in her interview 

2192
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:36,410
she said,
I'm a black Muslim female and this white

2193
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:38,550
kid is just a tip for wanting to teach 
my class.

2194
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:40,650
This is crazy.
This is crazy.

2195
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:42,450
This is a crazy world we're in,
man.

2196
01:47:42,451 --> 01:47:43,380
This is.
Do you.

2197
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:48,390
Are you optimistic about the future?
Yeah,

2198
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:56,060
I say that because it's going to take a 
lifetime's work and I don't think that 

2199
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:59,001
in our lifetime much is gonna Change.
I think maybe for the next generation.

2200
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:05,860
What is the picture of how do you 
conceive of your job at the moment and,

2201
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:06,700
and what,
uh,

2202
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:09,490
what is the status quo?
For instance,

2203
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:13,810
isis or the Islamic state is sort of 
fading from most people's memory now.

2204
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,030
I mean,
even mine,

2205
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:21,031
I'm A.
I'm spending much less time thinking 

2206
01:48:21,031 --> 01:48:21,031
about it because it seems to visit.
So let me tell you a story

2207
01:48:21,031 --> 01:48:21,930
so I can answer this question with a 
story.

2208
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:23,520
So radical,
which is my autobiography,

2209
01:48:23,521 --> 01:48:25,140
has a US publication,
right?

2210
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,480
I'm in the UK.
It's random house penguin.

2211
01:48:27,481 --> 01:48:29,160
It's published by the biggest publishing
house.

2212
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:32,850
When I came to publishing theU ,
s I approached publishing houses,

2213
01:48:32,851 --> 01:48:37,851
but it was after bin Laden was killed 
and so when we approached 10,

2214
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:38,850
20,
whatever,

2215
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:41,700
publishing houses the problem solve,
they all said no.

2216
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,170
They said the problem solved.
They said,

2217
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,270
we think,
you know,

2218
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:45,870
we wish you'd come to us five years 
earlier,

2219
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:48,270
but problem solve now there's not a 
problem anymore.

2220
01:48:48,271 --> 01:48:53,271
And uh,
and a bit like what you mentioned is 

2221
01:48:53,271 --> 01:48:53,271
sort of your expertise.
And,

2222
01:48:53,271 --> 01:48:55,140
and I,
I have been consumed by this subject all

2223
01:48:55,141 --> 01:49:00,141
my life and there are a few people on 
this planet that I would take seriously 

2224
01:49:00,141 --> 01:49:01,980
on this subject.
I'm outside especially of Quilliam.

2225
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:04,920
And there are other organizations,
they have some really good people,

2226
01:49:04,921 --> 01:49:07,740
but I know them all and we regularly 
speak.

2227
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:10,110
So I would say it's all of these 
publishing houses.

2228
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:15,440
I can assure you 100 percent this 
problem not only has not been solved is 

2229
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:18,810
going to come back around in a far west 
way than you can ever have imagined.

2230
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:21,720
This is before isis came along.
None of them believe me.

2231
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:23,640
Of course.
What then happened,

2232
01:49:23,770 --> 01:49:28,770
my cook book eventually got published by
some very small publishing house in the 

2233
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:31,410
US and has done quite well for them,
but the point of the story was this.

2234
01:49:31,411 --> 01:49:33,810
Isis came around and people were 
suddenly like,

2235
01:49:33,811 --> 01:49:35,280
oh my God,
where did this come from?

2236
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:40,820
Of course,
those of us who had been monitoring the 

2237
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:40,820
situation knew this was going to come 
back around very,

2238
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:43,200
very heavy.
Now that isis has been pushed back,

2239
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:48,250
and this is where this story is sort of 
the point of the story is we've got to 

2240
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:51,990
resist the temptation to believe the 
problem has been solved because the the 

2241
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:55,951
organization known as Isis,
which isn't a bureaucracy has been 

2242
01:49:55,951 --> 01:50:00,061
fought back,
but the ideology upon which that 

2243
01:50:00,061 --> 01:50:02,770
organization was built is still very 
much alive and it's still strong.

2244
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:07,840
What al Qaeda did while the whole world 
was focused on Isis was exploited,

2245
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:13,170
that opportunity to rebuild and regroup 
and they've been a rebuilding and Syria.

2246
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:16,600
Now they are stronger than they have 
ever been,

2247
01:50:16,601 --> 01:50:21,601
even under binladin because for the 
first time in the history of that 

2248
01:50:21,601 --> 01:50:24,991
organization,
they are firmly embedded within the 

2249
01:50:24,991 --> 01:50:27,781
Syrian population as a genuinely kind of
viewed by the people that they were 

2250
01:50:27,781 --> 01:50:30,940
fighting on behalf of as a grassroots 
resistance organization.

2251
01:50:30,941 --> 01:50:33,960
Whereas before that they were seen as a 
terrorist group that was like a,

2252
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:39,210
just like a vanguard.
They've embedded themselves in the 

2253
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:39,520
Syrian population,
in the Yemeni civil war.

2254
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:41,680
They've embedded themselves in north 
Africa,

2255
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:46,740
east Africa and in Pakistan,
and they are resurgent and they are 

2256
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:50,431
grooming Hamza bin Laden,
who has been not in some and the 

2257
01:50:50,431 --> 01:50:53,020
grooming infant leadership and a time 
will come maybe in a couple of months,

2258
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:58,021
maybe in a couple of years where they 
announced Hamza bin Ladin as a new 

2259
01:50:58,021 --> 01:50:58,990
leader of al Qaeda currently at Simon's 
Zawahari.

2260
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:04,350
When they do that,
once they're grooming has been complete 

2261
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:04,350
and assuming Hamza isn't killed,
uh,

2262
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:09,780
up until then,
all of the fragments of what remains of 

2263
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:11,500
Isis will probably rejoin all kind of 
under Hamza bin Laden.

2264
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:15,220
And you'll have a stronger than ever 
before on Kaleida organization.

2265
01:51:15,221 --> 01:51:20,221
And we've got to,
we've got to remember that we never 

2266
01:51:20,221 --> 01:51:20,221
expected isis to emerge.
Emergent,

2267
01:51:20,221 --> 01:51:20,980
kind of.
We'll come back with a vengeance.

2268
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:24,180
It.
What is the,

2269
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:27,370
the politics between the remnants of 
Isis,

2270
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:29,250
isis and al Qaeda.
Well,

2271
01:51:29,251 --> 01:51:34,251
how has it been hard in succession to 
the leadership solves that problem of 

2272
01:51:34,251 --> 01:51:37,591
the.
Because the isis guys were originally 

2273
01:51:37,591 --> 01:51:39,640
all kind of Isis was al Qaeda in Syria 
and they broke away after bin Laden died

2274
01:51:39,641 --> 01:51:42,550
because they didn't.
They had pledged allegiance to bin Ladin

2275
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:45,760
and the new leader of al Qaeda,
Ayman Suare is by all accounts,

2276
01:51:45,761 --> 01:51:48,460
a rather uncharismatic.
And you know,

2277
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:49,720
he's a,
he's a pediatrician.

2278
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:52,870
He's not really a kind of bin Laden.
Had the pediatrician.

2279
01:51:52,871 --> 01:51:53,350
Yeah,
he's a pro.

2280
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:58,380
He's Egyptian.
He's an Egyptian pediatrician from a 

2281
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:58,380
very well off Egyptian family by the 
way.

2282
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:02,940
I think his grandfather was the Egyptian
ambassador to the UN pharmacists and 

2283
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,480
it's been loud and clearly had the 
charisma,

2284
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:06,160
the wealth,
the presence,

2285
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,390
the looks.
He had all of it.

2286
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:10,280
That doesn't as worries,
you know,

2287
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,340
competitive bin Ladin.
It does.

2288
01:52:11,341 --> 01:52:16,341
It doesn't say if the guys that broke 
away from all kind of centers a watery,

2289
01:52:16,481 --> 01:52:18,850
the current leader,
we pledged allegiance to be lighting,

2290
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:21,130
we owe you nothing.
You're not our Amir,

2291
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:26,250
our leader.
If Hamza bin Ladin comes back in as the 

2292
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:30,481
leader of all kind of,
it solves that problem because of those 

2293
01:52:30,481 --> 01:52:33,811
remnants of Isis have a loyalty to the 
bin Ladin Name and had been in family 

2294
01:52:33,811 --> 01:52:37,861
and they remember what they consider 
their glory days fighting under on the 

2295
01:52:37,861 --> 01:52:37,861
bin Laden.

2296
01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:41,020
That's not nice to hear.
That's no good.

2297
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:41,330
No,
no.

2298
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:46,350
The problem has not gone away.
I can tell you that the problem and the 

2299
01:52:46,350 --> 01:52:49,591
problem is the ideology and it will not 
be dealt with until we deal with this 

2300
01:52:49,591 --> 01:52:50,510
ideology and it's why it's so dangerous 
to.

2301
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:55,870
You know,
there was this awful term that I railed 

2302
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:56,540
against.
It was so frustrating to see.

2303
01:52:56,541 --> 01:53:01,541
Under Obama's presidency,
the US State Department officially 

2304
01:53:01,541 --> 01:53:02,690
adopted as their name for challenging 
this problem.

2305
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:06,860
They adopted the term al Qaeda inspired 
extremism.

2306
01:53:07,670 --> 01:53:10,280
Of course it isn't.
It isn't al Qaeda,

2307
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:15,281
that it inspired extremism.
It's extremism that inspired al Qaeda 

2308
01:53:15,281 --> 01:53:16,340
and it's for the purposes of political 
correctness,

2309
01:53:16,341 --> 01:53:21,341
you adopt this term and the State 
Department officially that we're 

2310
01:53:21,341 --> 01:53:24,041
fighting across the world.
We are fighting al Qaeda inspired 

2311
01:53:24,041 --> 01:53:25,040
extremism.
My former organization,

2312
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:30,520
his caliphate espousing organization 
that believes in their ideal caliphate 

2313
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,790
that gays should be killed,
a doctorate,

2314
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:36,791
she should be stoned to death.
They were there before all Kinda and 

2315
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:37,860
this ideology has been there before on 
cod.

2316
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:42,890
Okada was one of a long line of groups 
that came as a result of the Islamist 

2317
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:44,990
ideology and we've got to start focusing
on the ideology itself,

2318
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:50,320
not the physical groups that spring up 
from it because they can change their 

2319
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:50,320
name.

2320
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,960
As you point out,
there is a another layer to the ideology

2321
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:55,630
that is all that is even more well 
subscribed,

2322
01:53:55,990 --> 01:53:58,210
that present social and political 
problems.

2323
01:53:58,211 --> 01:53:59,680
So for this one,
as you said,

2324
01:53:59,681 --> 01:54:03,760
there are conservative Muslims who don't
support al Qaeda.

2325
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:05,260
They're not jihadists.
They they can.

2326
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:09,640
They would honestly say bin Ladin 
doesn't represent my brand of Islam,

2327
01:54:09,910 --> 01:54:14,910
but these are still people who will,
who will say that homosexuals should be 

2328
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:15,060
killed.
So,

2329
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:20,150
so there,
there's the apparent allies against 

2330
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:25,110
extremism can still be people with so 
with religiously mandated social 

2331
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:29,350
attitudes that just cannot be 
assimilated in cosmopolitan societies.

2332
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:34,090
Uh,
so people who are worse,

2333
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,760
worse than worse than Al Qaeda inspired 
extremism.

2334
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:39,520
There's just this notion that on the 
left,

2335
01:54:39,521 --> 01:54:40,630
and,
and this was,

2336
01:54:40,631 --> 01:54:45,631
this came out of Obama's mouth and it 
came out of Clinton's mouth and it's 

2337
01:54:45,631 --> 01:54:45,890
largely why she's wasn't president.
Uh,

2338
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:50,440
it's not,
it's just generic extremism,

2339
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:51,330
right?
So that,

2340
01:54:51,340 --> 01:54:55,390
like in the same sentence that you have 
to worry about the caliphate.

2341
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:57,050
You have to talk about,
uh,

2342
01:54:57,210 --> 01:55:00,380
abortion doctors being killed in the US 
once every year,

2343
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:01,360
15 years.
So you read,

2344
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:06,361
of course,
you remember because President Obama 

2345
01:55:06,361 --> 01:55:06,361
refused to use the word Islamist 
extremism.

2346
01:55:06,361 --> 01:55:09,981
Of course trump has the other problem.
He thinks that like rumpelstiltskin by 

2347
01:55:09,981 --> 01:55:09,981
repeating it enough,
you've solved the problem.

2348
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:15,420
But,
but actually one of the elements in 

2349
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:15,540
which he was correctly critical of Obama
was an,

2350
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:20,541
I was at the time vocally critical of 
Obama's reluctance to use the word 

2351
01:55:20,541 --> 01:55:24,471
Islamist extremism.
And we've got no problem when we talk 

2352
01:55:24,471 --> 01:55:24,480
about,
you know,

2353
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:29,820
uh,
when we talk about white supremacist 

2354
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:32,331
ideology,
we don't mean that all white people are 

2355
01:55:32,331 --> 01:55:32,331
supremacists,
you know,

2356
01:55:32,331 --> 01:55:36,650
what we were doing here is it's actually
attributing precisely specifically what 

2357
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:40,950
the ideology is and believes in white 
supremacy and likewise Islamist,

2358
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:42,300
you know,
it's important.

2359
01:55:42,301 --> 01:55:47,010
So we can that ideology,
I'm still while not calling it Islam,

2360
01:55:47,490 --> 01:55:52,490
right?
So we're still giving a bit of a leeway 

2361
01:55:52,490 --> 01:55:52,490
there for everybody else,
all the other Muslims,

2362
01:55:52,490 --> 01:55:53,370
but to call it Islamic extremism,
Mr.

2363
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:55,110
recognize that it's an offshoot of 
Islam.

2364
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:58,080
It's a manifestation,
extreme or otherwise obvious lamb.

2365
01:55:58,470 --> 01:56:03,470
And thereby we are acknowledging that 
it's justification's are in Islamic 

2366
01:56:03,470 --> 01:56:05,250
scripture as well as of course,
a multiplicity of other calls,

2367
01:56:05,251 --> 01:56:08,040
these grievances and what have you.
But we cannot ignore that.

2368
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:12,450
It also rests on justifications that are
derived from the Islamic scripture.

2369
01:56:12,451 --> 01:56:14,760
I mean,
I can cite for the Arabic that tells you

2370
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:18,360
in the Koran itself to cut the hand of 
the thief or to lash the adulterer.

2371
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:19,950
Um,
you know,

2372
01:56:19,970 --> 01:56:22,770
these are all Heidi for the saying of 
the prophet that says,

2373
01:56:22,771 --> 01:56:24,870
kill the person that changes their 
religion.

2374
01:56:24,871 --> 01:56:28,110
This is scripture.
And so of course there are other factors

2375
01:56:28,111 --> 01:56:33,111
involved as well,
but one of the factors that gives rise 

2376
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:33,111
to this,
uh,

2377
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:35,370
is the unreformed scripture that these 
extremist site.

2378
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:38,460
And so we have to acknowledge that Islam
has a role to play.

2379
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:40,180
I often say that,
you know,

2380
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,000
because again,
under the Obama presidency,

2381
01:56:42,001 --> 01:56:45,360
it was frustrating that the common 
refrain was to say that Islam,

2382
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:48,480
this has nothing to do with Islam.
This is absurd.

2383
01:56:48,481 --> 01:56:51,390
Is arguing that the Spanish inquisition 
had nothing to do with Catholicism.

2384
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:52,920
He went even further.
One point,

2385
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:57,921
didn't he at one point say that not only
does this have nothing to do with his 

2386
01:56:57,921 --> 01:57:01,161
mom,
this has less to do with Islam than any 

2387
01:57:01,161 --> 01:57:01,420
other related intimately that if it was 
just he bent over backwards.

2388
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:03,780
It's nice saying the crusades have 
nothing to do with Christianity.

2389
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:06,060
Gentlemen,
unfortunately.

2390
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:09,750
Have to wrap this up.
I really appreciate you guys coming on.

2391
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:13,230
It was a real pleasure to meet you and 
your book.

2392
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:18,530
It's the book is Islam and the future of
tolerance and actually were the one 

2393
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:22,440
thing we do have to announce is we're 
going to Sydney and Auckland.

2394
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:27,860
Yeah.
Two of us and Douglas Murray and both 

2395
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:29,250
Weinstein brothers were we're going to 
wreck those towns.

2396
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:34,310
Oh my goodness.
We're going to have you doing live 

2397
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:36,861
podcasts a day long conference generic.
No,

2398
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:44,640
but it'd be great to get both of them 
together that rarely.

2399
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,120
Those guys are awesome.
I'm really grateful to meet both of them

2400
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:49,690
and you as well.
Thank you guys.

2401
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:50,820
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
