1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,660
Four three,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,613
two,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,453
one.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,200
Robin Black Gentleman.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:09,940
What's up buddy?

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,381
Hey man,

7
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,200
it's great to see you.

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,760
Are you fresh back from Singapore?

9
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,240
I am,

10
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,451
yeah,

11
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:15,340
I was in Singapore like 48 hours ago.

12
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,530
Did they make that special
shiny silver one for you?

13
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,130
Because that looks like this
design for you know it's,

14
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,761
I mean,

15
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:22,061
yeah,

16
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:23,710
it does Kinda look like
it's designed for me,

17
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:24,880
which is why I wanted that.

18
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,300
Yeah,

19
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,380
it's a rock and roll.

20
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:27,430
One Championship.

21
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:28,570
One AFC championship.

22
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,150
So what's it like over there man?

23
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,810
Let me explain to everybody.

24
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:34,630
One FC is like the Asian
version of the UFC.

25
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:38,300
It's a gigantic organization that
has been going on for how long now?

26
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,560
Yeah,

27
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,560
2011 so solid seven years and
really high level fights over there.

28
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,681
Amazing,

29
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:45,411
amazing fight.

30
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,500
Singapore itself is wild.

31
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,930
So I went over there to chat with them.

32
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:50,990
So chat tree,

33
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,143
city of tongue,

34
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,890
Robinson and he and I
had been chatting and,

35
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,540
and I love kind of how
they see martial arts.

36
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,370
So they don't call it even fc anymore.

37
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:01,420
It's just one championship.

38
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,070
They don't even use the word fighting.

39
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:03,730
Really.

40
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,870
It's martial arts.

41
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,050
And the way I see it and the way I studied
martial arts and share it is an art

42
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:12,970
form like painting or yoga or you know,

43
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:13,660
things,

44
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,530
things of that nature.

45
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,281
Less spectacle.

46
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:18,280
That's always how I've seen it and I was
how I love it and that's how they see

47
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,930
it and that's how they present it.

48
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,010
And that's,

49
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,010
it's presented from this
sort of inspirational own
your history kind of way in

50
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:26,890
Asia.

51
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,440
And that was what attracted
me to them right away.

52
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,303
I mean it's,

53
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,200
it's definitely an art form.

54
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,580
It's values based,

55
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:37,870
like they're kind of seeking to inspire
people through these athletes and

56
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:38,291
artists.

57
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,490
It's pretty fucking cool.

58
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,430
So what,

59
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,530
what's motivating them to take
this a sort of radical approach?

60
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,830
So it's wild that you say that
because to me this is the approach.

61
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,400
So I think what we do or the way that we
presented in North America is radical.

62
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,830
I think martial arts is an art form.

63
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,020
Martial arts is this inspiring thing.

64
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,771
I mean you take,

65
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:05,200
say for example on loud song,

66
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,500
he is there 185 pound
and 205 pound champion.

67
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,880
He's from me and Mar,

68
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,890
they have never had a world champion
in any sport ever in their history.

69
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:17,080
I don't think they've had a
gold medalist in the Olympics.

70
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,340
They've never had that.

71
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,370
This guy's a two division
champion that will,

72
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:24,580
and that when I talked to [inaudible]
about it and he was talking sort of about

73
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:28,420
why he sees it this way and why
he's proud to present it this way.

74
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:29,230
He's like,

75
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,810
he knows without question
that there are kids.

76
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:36,811
And he won his 205 pound title in me
and mark in a stadium in Myanmar and he

77
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:37,570
said,

78
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,220
he knows without question
there's a kid in,

79
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:41,200
they're going to become a
lawyer one day because of that.

80
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,940
And they can feel it and it's real.

81
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:43,774
It's not like,

82
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,540
it's not like a marketing strategy.

83
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,010
Like this is how they see martial arts
and it's how martial arts is viewed in

84
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:51,760
Asia.

85
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,593
Martial arts,

86
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,300
I get to travel so much now
it's viewed different in Russia.

87
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,830
It's few different in Brazil.

88
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,430
Hello?

89
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,263
Viewed in Russia.

90
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,700
Russia is wild man.

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,010
I

92
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,110
got to work for uh,

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,033
ACB,

94
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,441
you know,

95
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,274
ACB.

96
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,230
Yeah.

97
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,070
Not Organization,

98
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,861
big organizations.

99
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,861
So in Russia it's very masculine and it's
about about victory and about showing

100
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,260
your power and your
strength and it really,

101
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:14,511
and,

102
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,820
and Russia is like that,

103
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,391
you know,

104
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,460
it's a reflection kind of of Russia.

105
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,743
Yeah.

106
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,320
Um,

107
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,460
the martial art thing,

108
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,380
I absolutely agree with you on that.

109
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,970
It is an art form,

110
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,920
but I also think it's a fight like
Gilbert Melendez versus Diego Sanchez.

111
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,460
Yup.

112
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,840
That's an art form.

113
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,730
But it's a fight that was,

114
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,160
that was a fucking wild fight.

115
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,940
And there's no way that's just art.

116
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,650
That's,

117
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,400
that's art and a fight.

118
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,810
It's both things.

119
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,060
Is that a fight is hard.

120
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,163
It's a way.

121
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,730
It is in a way.

122
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,310
It's an expression of your personality,

123
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:51,320
your individuality.

124
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,841
It's heart.

125
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,860
Your fearlessness.

126
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,240
100% but it's a fight.

127
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,740
I'm not scared of the word fight.

128
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:55,951
No,

129
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:56,260
I'm not

130
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,561
like,

131
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,250
I like it.

132
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,090
I like that word.

133
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,180
But it is an art form.

134
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,720
Yes.

135
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,553
Fights are art.

136
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:02,981
Yes,

137
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:03,341
definitely.

138
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,130
I mean like Anderson Silva's
second fight with shale son,

139
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,810
the way he landed that need of the body
on the ground with that is just art.

140
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,673
That's art,

141
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,131
you know?

142
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:12,964
I mean,

143
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,301
if you,

144
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,990
you go back to Leo Machida just landing
that front kick on Vitor Belfort,

145
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,560
that's our into is,

146
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,000
it's especially for someone who practices

147
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,923
martial arts,

148
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,460
you see the beauty in that you're like,

149
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,121
ah,

150
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:29,010
it's like a flower blossoming or
sunrise or just something perfect.

151
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,950
The impossibility of it
is what's so beautiful.

152
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Like these guys are so unwilling partners
and they have such like a desire to

153
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,280
accomplish what they want to accomplish.

154
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,310
To kick that guy in the face from that
position with Victoria has a lifetime of

155
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:47,364
this,

156
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,460
a lifetime of being able to not let you
do that and for you to first be willing

157
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,840
to be free enough to try it,

158
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,711
you know,

159
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:55,951
and,

160
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:56,784
and to,

161
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,800
to express it in that moment.

162
00:04:58,801 --> 00:04:59,760
It is definitely hard,

163
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:00,051
but I,

164
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:00,601
I'm with you.

165
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,180
Fight doesn't intimidate me at all.

166
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,201
You know,

167
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,610
a fight is a beautiful thing.

168
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,400
A fight is we fight for
things all the time.

169
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:08,710
You know,

170
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,040
it's a metaphor for life
itself when you fight.

171
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,770
I think

172
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,330
bull rightly so,

173
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,360
are concerned with the idea of violence
against someone who's an unwilling

174
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:20,170
participant.

175
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,960
And that's how they think of fighting.

176
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,080
They think of it as this thing
that they want nothing to do with.

177
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,760
They don't want any
violence in their life.

178
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,050
They don't want anybody to hurt them.

179
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,550
And I completely understand that.

180
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,440
I understand that position.

181
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,360
But that's not what it is.

182
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,620
When it's a competition.

183
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,580
I mean,

184
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:36,821
I,

185
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,190
it's a tired expression because
I've said it too many times,

186
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,320
but my perception of what fighting is
is high level problem solving with dire

187
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,420
physical consequences.

188
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:45,560
Yes.

189
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,860
Time.

190
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,570
And then the physical consequences
are what make it so special.

191
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,320
You know?

192
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,153
No question,

193
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,203
no question.

194
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,800
Times make the good times better,

195
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,571
you know,

196
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:57,010
and the,

197
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,500
the,

198
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:57,710
the,

199
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,710
the possibility that bad things can
happen to you and do sometimes happen even

200
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,650
to the great ones,

201
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,281
you know,

202
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:04,491
I mean,

203
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:08,150
you see great fighters had been
KOD and come back and you know,

204
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:08,750
there's,

205
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,321
that's a,

206
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,300
there's something about
that where you realize like,

207
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:11,661
hey,

208
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,430
even fade or it can get knocked out.

209
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,331
You know what I mean?

210
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:14,661
Hey,

211
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:15,350
even,

212
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,591
you know,

213
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:19,100
Anderson Silva can get play
cocky and get caught by that.

214
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,210
Chris Weidman left hook.

215
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,391
I mean,

216
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,170
this is just,

217
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,130
this is just the game

218
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,930
and you know,

219
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,880
I think in Asia in particular,

220
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,610
but there's different pockets of,

221
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,340
of how these this is viewed
and how the philosophy of,

222
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,670
of connecting to martial
arts and fighting is viewed.

223
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,030
And in Asia you would see a certain
amount of the fighters would see being

224
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,470
losing badly is,

225
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:42,840
uh,

226
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,400
uh,

227
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,233
opportunity,

228
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,710
a chance because to come back and win
again or to come back and show that you're

229
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,730
able and you,

230
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,760
you were given the gift
of trying and failing.

231
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,863
You know what I mean?

232
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,780
Do you know you man,

233
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,120
you know?

234
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,451
Yeah.

235
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:56,770
That's a great way to approach it.

236
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a great way to look at it.

237
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,090
You know what I mean?

238
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,090
That there really is a lesson that the
average person can take in their life.

239
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:08,830
Like every time a person does
have a bad thing happen to them,

240
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:12,520
it's an that dead terrible feelings
and opportunity to rise from the ashes.

241
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,310
Yeah.

242
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,800
And winning when it's,

243
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,780
when you're just winning at everything.

244
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:21,890
And things come easily to you
that I'm sure it still feels good,

245
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,520
but when you've gone through really hard
times or when you've been challenged by

246
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,170
something or do you drop lower,

247
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,780
the high of the success is so much higher.

248
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:31,160
It's so much of a longer journey.

249
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,293
Personally,

250
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,860
when we've spoke before and
when we talked about cm punk,

251
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:37,970
when he was fighting the first time,

252
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,390
I was like,

253
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,210
this is stupid.

254
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:39,641
You know,

255
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:40,750
and this guy is,

256
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,690
is pushing,

257
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,400
stacking himself into a position to try
to not fail by making the challenge so

258
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,020
difficult that even if he fails,

259
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:48,854
you don't really,

260
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,230
but this is fully different now,

261
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,383
but now I'm,

262
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,490
I'm cheering for him because
he was humiliated like he was.

263
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,940
He didn't just fail.

264
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,440
He was humiliated.

265
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,070
He,

266
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,800
he in front of everybody was shown to be,

267
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,070
you know,

268
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,020
people would judge them as weak or people
the judgment that he would feel his

269
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,400
bad and he sat,

270
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,270
I'll go do it again.

271
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,403
He,

272
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,090
we are now in a completely different
context because that's a guy who epically

273
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:21,050
failed in front of everybody and
then dealt with that and now says,

274
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,940
I will try the journey again and this
will make me a better person and I now I

275
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,020
fully endorse this,

276
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:27,890
I'm cheering for him.

277
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,211
Well,

278
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:32,320
he's now fighting a fighter who's
commensurate in talent and there's nothing

279
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,900
wrong with being a
beginner in martial arts,

280
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,830
but there's something wrong with thinking
that you can be a beginner and fight

281
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:40,240
Micky gall big time.

282
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:40,730
Absolutely.

283
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,500
It was a foolish venture and I,

284
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:42,880
I,

285
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,560
I wa my approach to it was this is going
to be a very good lesson for people

286
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,770
that are fans of positive thinking
and they think that's enough.

287
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,160
That shit is not enough.

288
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,100
If you weigh 110 pounds,

289
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,731
you get positive.

290
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,650
Think your way to the bank.

291
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,470
Frances and Ganos still
gonna Punch your brains out.

292
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,820
There's just no way around it.

293
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:08,030
And a guy who has really very little
experience in martial arts and has

294
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:11,100
rudimentary control of his body.

295
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,731
I mean,

296
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,680
that's what I saw when I saw him training.

297
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,211
When I saw him training,

298
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:15,570
I was like,

299
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,350
oh my God,

300
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,580
he's getting killed

301
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,950
in that context.

302
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,870
And I,

303
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,840
but he belongs here.

304
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,450
Yeah.

305
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,283
And that's,

306
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,200
and everything's contextual.

307
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,650
Like,

308
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,660
just because I thought that was stupid.

309
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,560
It was stupid.

310
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,790
It was stupid.

311
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,710
But that doesn't mean in this context,

312
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:32,550
I can't look and go.

313
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,820
There's a guy who didn't need to,

314
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,840
he doesn't need to come back.

315
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,920
He doesn't need to try again.

316
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,030
He doesn't need to go into the gym.

317
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:39,864
And I've been there.

318
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,710
You're in the gym and everyone's gone out,

319
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:41,911
man.

320
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,270
You did.

321
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,103
You did good.

322
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,800
I didn't do guy fucking failed
miserably in front of everybody.

323
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,950
And then show up there cleaning the
mats and work really hard and said,

324
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm going to try it again.

325
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:51,720
Uh,

326
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,440
and yes,

327
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,130
that fight still him and this guy
still should take place somewhere else.

328
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,241
Oh,

329
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:57,200
a hundred percent sure.

330
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,700
I mean,

331
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,850
shouldn't even be on the
Tuesday night contender show.

332
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,330
No,

333
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,571
no.

334
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:01,170
It shouldn't.

335
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,310
Should be in some amateur event somewhere
because that's really what they are

336
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,770
there.

337
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,130
They're guys learning how to compete.

338
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,880
Yeah.

339
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,390
Um,

340
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,100
during the first fight in the paper view.

341
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,521
Yeah,

342
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,720
that's fucking crazy.

343
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,190
But that has nothing to do with them.

344
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,120
That is a reflection on the
company that's on a perception on,

345
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,740
on the choices that the machine makes.

346
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,550
Um,

347
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,420
and we also gave them a juicy contract.

348
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,283
Yes,

349
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,140
make that valid or viable
right to make money off it.

350
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,870
But that again,

351
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,010
I think it makes,

352
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,780
it makes it deeper and harder and
more chances to fail epically and,

353
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,070
and I lost twice in a row and then
still want it to fight again and still

354
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:41,880
because it,

355
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,930
I really want it to,

356
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,400
and,

357
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,860
and it was important to me and it meant
something to me and I was going to

358
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:48,660
change as a human being by doing it.

359
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,980
And I was ridiculed.

360
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,690
I can relate to what he's going through,

361
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,240
but I did it on a little
show and in Winnipeg,

362
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,074
Manitoba,

363
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,973
we know what I mean.

364
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,330
I would never have put myself
in that place to look bad,

365
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:04,950
but here he is and here it is and
I'm cheering for him as a store,

366
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:09,951
as a human being in a weird situation
that has been put himself into a deep dark

367
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:16,920
hard spot and saying my way out of this
is to try really hard and really go in

368
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:17,260
and,

369
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,600
and the chance all of that I would want
for him if I knew them and he was my

370
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:26,550
friend is to fight your way through some
adverse situations to be able to be in

371
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:29,190
it and find when it's hard you discover,

372
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,960
yeah I can handle it when it's hard,

373
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:31,590
I can,

374
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,740
I can get up when I've been dropped or
I can fight through not being able to

375
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:35,310
breathe.

376
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,690
If he loses and does that,

377
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,160
it will have been worth it for him.

378
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,020
No matter how much ridicule he'll take,

379
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,250
it will have been worth it for him.

380
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,140
What was really weird watching him walk
to the cage was that he was approaching

381
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,900
and liga pro wrestling fight cause he
had done so many of these pro wrestling

382
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:52,230
matches that he was walking to
the cage with like pro wrestling,

383
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,190
mannerisms,

384
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,980
everything.

385
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,830
And I all,

386
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,480
I was watching this and I,

387
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,820
you know,

388
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,660
I did like an internal head shake.

389
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,840
Like fuck yeah,

390
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,040
like this.

391
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,873
You can't,

392
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,540
it was a terrible idea.

393
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,890
Like whoever his side said
that he could fight Micky Gall,

394
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:09,880
you're out of your fucking mind.

395
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,150
Watch that kid fight once a
kid is very good on the ground,

396
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,260
very good.

397
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,360
Big and strong young standups.

398
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,200
Not bad either.

399
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:17,710
You know,

400
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,390
and he's tough as shit and he's smart,

401
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,220
he's clever and he's mean.

402
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,720
He's mean fucker.

403
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,560
And that is at that stage
he was maybe one to know,

404
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:26,891
I think,

405
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:26,951
uh,

406
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:27,784
maybe too,

407
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,050
but it's still the lowest level that
there is in the entire elite world of

408
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:32,381
fighting.

409
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,480
Not that it didn't matter the way.

410
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:35,260
One,

411
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,190
like you saw it,

412
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,080
you saw the way it took that guy's back
and the way sinks hooks in when he was

413
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:43,050
on top and just delivering that type.

414
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,983
Yeah,

415
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,640
that's,

416
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,110
and you're 100% right.

417
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,580
What if somebody is watching that?

418
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,000
That is the reality of
thinking I won't really war I,

419
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll put myself in a
situation that I can't win,

420
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,850
but I've got guts and heart and
I believe I'm going to do it.

421
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,120
You get the metaphorical version
of that punch in the face.

422
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,170
If you go through life like that,

423
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,760
yes you do and you know what?

424
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:07,210
You shouldn't do it in fighting because
you don't want those punches in the face

425
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,500
if you can't avoid them.

426
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,693
Like if,

427
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,950
if you're in a situation where you're,

428
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,970
you want to prove your toughness and
you want to be battled against someone

429
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:19,900
who's of your skill level and try to
figure your way through the maze of this

430
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:20,740
contest,

431
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,850
that makes sense.

432
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,750
What doesn't make sense is getting
punched in the face unnecessarily.

433
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,980
And when you fight,

434
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,233
in my opinion,

435
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,170
when I looked at that fight,

436
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:29,650
I was like,

437
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,330
Mickey galls going to smash him.

438
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,160
This is just how it's going to go.

439
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,980
There's very few fights where I can tell
you this is absolutely gonna happen.

440
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,370
Like,

441
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,300
here's a perfect example.

442
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,370
Ropy Hofeld dose on Joe's,

443
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:39,851
uh,

444
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:40,321
against,

445
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:40,510
uh,

446
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,350
Colby Covington.

447
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,520
I don't know what the fuck's happened.

448
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,210
No idea how to,

449
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:43,570
no,

450
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:43,751
no.

451
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:44,441
We're going to get in there.

452
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:45,220
They're gonna throw it down.

453
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,940
Let's see.

454
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,773
Let's see.

455
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,130
Micky gall versus,

456
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,151
you know,

457
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:49,984
um,

458
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,320
I forgot to cm punk.

459
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,031
What's his real name?

460
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,070
Phil Jackson.

461
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,030
No apartment.

462
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,370
Whatever.

463
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,040
Yeah.

464
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,873
Cm punk.

465
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,450
What is it?

466
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,710
Jamie Brooks.

467
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,220
Brooks.

468
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,640
Brooks.

469
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,473
Phil Brooks.

470
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:04,991
Sorry,

471
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:05,620
Phil.

472
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,453
Um,

473
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,211
I was like,

474
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:07,361
well,

475
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:07,541
he's,

476
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,790
this is a terrible idea
because he's just going to get,

477
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,070
you can only get punched in the
face so many times in your life.

478
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,450
Yeah.

479
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,450
And you have a number,

480
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:14,350
whatever the number is,

481
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,184
everybody's different.

482
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,560
Mark Hunt's number seems
to be extraordinarily high.

483
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,870
Yeah.

484
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,703
You know,

485
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,520
there's some people that could
just take it and this is true,

486
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,510
but you know,

487
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,940
you don't want it when you can't avoid it.

488
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,571
And he could,

489
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:28,760
he's not gonna avoid it in that fight and
I'm just going to get smashed and less

490
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,110
make,

491
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,040
he caught a crazy armbar early in the
fight and that was what he gave him.

492
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,760
That's,

493
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,120
yeah.

494
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Other than that he's getting his face
smashed in and you should not do that if

495
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:37,954
you don't have to.

496
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:38,883
But that,

497
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,870
I remember when we spoke about it,

498
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:45,871
it's unconscious incompetence and that
if you don't know what you don't know,

499
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,990
like it's a really
fucking weird place to be.

500
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,980
And we go through life
that way a lot of times

501
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,710
in a lot of different
contacts until you find out,

502
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,760
you know,

503
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
conscious incompetence where like,

504
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,101
oh fuck,

505
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:59,510
I don't know anything about this.

506
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,920
And he wasn't even at that point.

507
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,650
Now he's at that point and
he has a lower level thing.

508
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:04,100
So,

509
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,150
and you know,

510
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:05,660
he didn't,

511
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,850
it was a mistake to start down this road.

512
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,990
But you're down at now.

513
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,303
You're on it now.

514
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,203
So,

515
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,103
you know,

516
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,690
it seems to me that,

517
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,531
I mean,

518
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:15,610
he's taken,

519
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:15,911
what,

520
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:17,500
two years since that fight.

521
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:17,660
Yeah.

522
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,660
It's been about two years getting there
and we've subsequently got to see Micky

523
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,740
Gall and some contests against
some really tough guys age.

524
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:26,940
Yeah.

525
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,270
Yeah.

526
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,300
Beat some good guys.

527
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,381
And we got to see like,

528
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:29,651
okay,

529
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:31,060
this kid is fucking for real,

530
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:33,250
which is what we suspected all along.

531
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,040
But we don't know anything about Phil.

532
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,390
We haven't seen him spar,

533
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:38,450
we haven't seen retrained.

534
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,480
But from what I saw when I
first saw him training the,

535
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:43,180
the first,

536
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,421
you know,

537
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,570
when I first saw him
sparring and moving around,

538
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:46,200
it's like,

539
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,771
God damn,

540
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:47,920
there's a lot of work to be done.

541
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,310
Like,

542
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,641
you know,

543
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:51,250
like first steps of
Everest work to be done.

544
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:51,850
It's like,

545
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,331
this is,

546
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:52,780
um,

547
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,340
we're not talking about a guy who has
like a deep background in martial arts,

548
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,610
like a Brock Lesnar wrestling
is absolutely a martial art.

549
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,870
He was a legit top of the
food chain amateur wrestler.

550
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:05,610
He was a fucking

551
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,620
monster and a physical monster.

552
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:07,890
I mean,

553
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,140
yeah,

554
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,410
that and a psychological monster,

555
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,630
like fighting his skills for sure.

556
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,760
But it's your body and it's your mind.

557
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,970
And when you are a heavy competitor,

558
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:19,140
when you focus,

559
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:22,140
when you're able to focus in the deepest,

560
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,000
most fearful conditions,

561
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:24,390
you know,

562
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:24,481
uh,

563
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:25,590
Brock Lesnar did that,

564
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,400
you know,

565
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,233
and uh,

566
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,590
physically when you're aware,

567
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:29,071
like you said,

568
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,180
we are aware of where your body
is in space and how to control it.

569
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,810
That can take a lifetime.

570
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,420
And so it's a weird one,

571
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:36,880
but

572
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,930
something you also develop as a child,

573
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:39,950
as a young kid.

574
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,130
Like when you're in your
developmental years,

575
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,180
1314,

576
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:44,601
15,

577
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:48,320
you're body's growing and it's growing
into whipping kicks and punches and

578
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,450
shooting takedowns and landing chokes.

579
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,430
Your body develops that way.

580
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,660
When you're a full grown man in your
thirties and then you're starting to throw

581
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,430
roundhouse kicks in
front kicks and you're,

582
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,070
your body's all goofy
and shit and it doesn't,

583
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,150
doesn't want to listen.

584
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:02,511
Right?

585
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:03,680
It's not pliable.

586
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:04,820
It's not elastic.

587
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,070
It says that you're a different animal.

588
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,080
You can still learn anything.

589
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,790
You at 50 years old,

590
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,620
you can take up anything in the world.

591
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:15,410
You'd take up anything and you should,

592
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:15,581
yeah,

593
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:16,500
you should be shitting,

594
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,160
you know,

595
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,210
go in the NFL with it.

596
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:22,020
Or if you start playing piano when you're
50 you should learn to play piano and

597
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:24,060
show all your friends
that you know the song or,

598
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,530
but you can't go like,

599
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,101
you know,

600
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:29,670
be in a concert piano scenario
where you're going to fail and,

601
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,020
and doing it and saying,

602
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:31,171
you know,

603
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:36,171
I believe doesn't make a difference
when you can't physically or mentally or

604
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:37,710
psychologically do these things.

605
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:42,420
But I still think learning and growing
and chasing things and self improvement

606
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:43,620
is the root of who we are.

607
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,480
I agree.

608
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,751
Yeah.

609
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:45,680
I think it is too.

610
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,830
But you can't be a 34 year old man has
never boxed a day your life and have a

611
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:50,190
goal

612
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,440
to in 12 months fight Loma Chanko no,

613
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,033
no.

614
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,010
It's never going to happen.

615
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,450
And if it does happen,

616
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,860
it's going to be a disaster.

617
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,190
And that there are giant exceptions like
one in a million of things where people

618
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:05,221
do things,

619
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,830
but there's always some other explanation.

620
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,690
And often it is as a youth,

621
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,190
they created the neural pathways and the
physicality and the connection to their

622
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:14,880
body.

623
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,510
You know,

624
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,110
I was,

625
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,320
uh,

626
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,780
I did gymnastics when I
was a kid and I loved it.

627
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,500
It's great base.

628
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,921
Yeah,

629
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:20,551
I loved it.

630
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:20,761
And,

631
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:21,540
and,

632
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,620
and you know,

633
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,010
it helps you physically
understand where your body is.

634
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,930
And so later on in life,

635
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:32,190
I was always at least okay at
sports because I understood
how to move my body in

636
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,670
space and I understood where my hand was
compared to my foot and how I balanced

637
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:36,060
and,

638
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,370
and to learn that as a child,

639
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,140
somebody who was a master of something
as a kid who at 30 picks up another thing

640
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,450
and has some really
advanced learning abilities.

641
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,870
There are exceptions that
we see rare exceptions,

642
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:49,410
but,

643
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,041
but you're right,

644
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,960
I mean reality still reality.

645
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,831
I wonder too,

646
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,480
if those exceptions are genetic,

647
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:58,020
I wonder if like maybe perhaps someone
in their family was a great athlete and

648
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,640
it's transferred through their genes,

649
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,680
which I am as I get older,

650
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,940
a firm believer in,

651
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,570
um,

652
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,710
I just don't think we know enough
about what transfers through genes.

653
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,210
But there's some freaky shit I see
in my kids in particular where I go,

654
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:12,541
okay,

655
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,520
that is my fucking personality.

656
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,010
That's the something and I'm
not teaching her to do this.

657
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,140
This is something that's in her like this,

658
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,430
the repetitive g like exercise,

659
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,110
like doing things over and over again,

660
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,790
obsessively like there's,

661
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,200
there's some weird shit that like,

662
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:28,570
I'm like,

663
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,030
I wonder if that's a neural pathway
that's passed down through the DNA.

664
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,800
I mean it just seems like there could
be a person who's never engaged in

665
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,371
athletics,

666
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:42,240
but maybe their grandfather was like a
world champion boxer and then one day

667
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:46,100
they put on the gloves and then they just
sorta like start moving around and the

668
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:46,561
coach was like,

669
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,250
Hey,

670
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,480
what the fuck's going on here?

671
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,100
Where'd you learn how to
throw a jab like that?

672
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,840
I'm forgetting.

673
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,400
Francis and Ghana's coach's name,

674
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,760
I forget his name is Fernando Lopez.

675
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,480
Yes.

676
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,070
He's a wonderful guy.

677
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,240
A smart guy.

678
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,141
Really.

679
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:04,230
He's been around like the best
of the best through Europe,

680
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:07,650
so and Cameroon to France and these areas.

681
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:11,940
And he's seen the best of the best
that that genetic crop of humans has to

682
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:12,774
offer.

683
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,640
And then Francis and got it walks into
his gym and you talk to Y'all next time

684
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:22,020
you see for an end to ask them about
this cause you see his eyes light up like

685
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,570
that thing where this like a
color in the eye and he's like,

686
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,111
you know,

687
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:25,950
I just knew,

688
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:26,850
like he said,

689
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:31,350
I watched him do things in his awareness
of his body and how he could physically

690
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:31,981
express himself.

691
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,140
He said he had just never seen
anything like it and this is,

692
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:34,860
you know,

693
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,090
week one in the gym,

694
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:37,320
he said first sparring session.

695
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,180
He didn't really know how to fight yet,

696
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,740
but he said he saw him adapting and
learning within the round against somebody

697
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:45,990
who knew how to fight and
you see it in his eyes.

698
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:46,200
He,

699
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,100
he literally found fucking Unicorn

700
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,310
just strolled in off
the street and came in.

701
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:52,144
And then he was like,

702
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,451
man,

703
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,890
if he's had some work ethic,

704
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:54,724
if he is like,

705
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,710
you know,

706
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,370
if he's passionate about this,

707
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,350
if he can commit and learn and all that,

708
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:00,430
it goes physically,

709
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:01,720
genetically speaking,

710
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,770
this human being,

711
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,120
the length of his bones,

712
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:04,480
the,

713
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,130
the speed of his neurology,

714
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,030
all of these things he said you just
knew and you see it in his face.

715
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:10,600
You're like,

716
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,051
oh fuck.

717
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,250
That must have been wild.

718
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,460
Like it must have been wild to,

719
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,830
to experience that when you
have a lifetime of seeing.

720
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:19,421
Yeah.

721
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:21,760
It's like that scene
in the color of money.

722
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,110
I don't know if you ever saw the movie
of course with Paul Move Paul Newman and

723
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:28,810
Tom Cruise when a Paul Newman,

724
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:29,680
here's Tom Cruise,

725
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,120
break the balls for the first time.

726
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:31,871
It turns a rose.

727
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:33,880
What the fuck is going on over here?

728
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,440
And he looks over and he sees his kid.

729
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,191
There's,

730
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:40,030
there's certain people that just have
this crazy talent and when someone has

731
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:45,031
been around for a long time as a
coach and had a bunch of untalented or

732
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:47,710
reasonably talented are
very talented people.

733
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:47,891
This,

734
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:52,600
this big stew of humans coming to their
gym and you see that one unicorn that

735
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,630
steps in and he's also
case where his father,

736
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,970
I mean he doesn't have a backer,

737
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,590
he didn't have a background in martial
arts before he started training,

738
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,240
but his father was a great street
fighter and it's entirely possible that

739
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,930
something was carried on through him or

740
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,410
something was present in both.

741
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:12,760
That allowed them both to be capable
of doing that rather than the learn to

742
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:13,271
pass.

743
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:16,630
Cause we don't know how that
passes genetically from,

744
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,800
from behavior.

745
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,430
We know that genetically we may
behave similar to our parents,

746
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:22,080
our kids,

747
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,250
right.

748
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,310
When we don't know if that came from that.

749
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,503
But uh,

750
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,280
I just,

751
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:33,030
I'm a hoe this weirdly uncomfortable
thinking about genetics because I don't

752
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:37,150
like the idea that we're limited by them.

753
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,070
And I know that we're not on some level,

754
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,391
but we are,

755
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:40,900
but,

756
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,450
but then I'm not going to play basketball.

757
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,220
He has since Lebron James.

758
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:46,780
But if we identified no,

759
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,081
no,

760
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:47,914
we're not.

761
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,670
No.

762
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,220
Where we do,

763
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,031
it's not going to go.

764
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:50,471
Whoa.

765
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:50,820
Okay.

766
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,010
No,

767
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,720
there's some,

768
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,790
there's definitely some truths.

769
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,001
I mean,

770
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm five foot six on a tall day.

771
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,060
Like that is a genetic
limitation that is undeniable.

772
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,910
Right.

773
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,350
Um,

774
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,730
but if we're looking at things
and we decide that our genes,

775
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,890
have you seen the movie
Gattica they ever seen them?

776
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:09,280
We've been,

777
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,080
I did see that movie a long time ago.

778
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,580
That's why my favorite movies ever.

779
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,653
Matt,

780
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,030
Ethan Hawke.

781
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,600
Train hoc.

782
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:16,960
Yeah.

783
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,730
I always think of him as Uma Thurman.

784
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,593
Yeah,

785
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,613
she's in it.

786
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,221
I know,

787
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:24,220
but I think of him cause he
used to be married to her.

788
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:24,521
I'm like,

789
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:24,641
oh,

790
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:26,890
that's Uma Thurman Thurman.

791
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,021
But you know what I mean?

792
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:28,854
Yeah.

793
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,120
In that movie,

794
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,970
his brother is genetically
superior to him,

795
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,520
but he beats his brother in the
swimming contests all the time.

796
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:37,870
And at the end his brother is like,

797
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,130
how are you doing this?

798
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,671
And he said,

799
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,710
I never saved anything for the swim back.

800
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,250
I was just going to
swim to the other side.

801
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:43,650
And his brothers,

802
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,980
like there is no fucking other side.

803
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,910
But it was a [inaudible].

804
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,743
I know it's a movie,

805
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,790
but it was a mindset.

806
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,320
Right.

807
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,960
And the truth is that's like talent.

808
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:51,261
Okay.

809
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,530
So you're talented at certain things
and Jamie's talents a certain things.

810
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,370
Francis and Ghana.

811
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,940
Talented talent multiplied
by effort equals skill.

812
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,890
Yeah.

813
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,870
Then skill multiplied by
effort equals accomplishment.

814
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,060
So effort counts twice,

815
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,690
right?

816
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:08,781
Yeah,

817
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,190
for counts fucking twice.

818
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,920
But then you get effort with a
talented guy with freak genetics,

819
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:18,921
like a Lebron James or a Michael Jordan
or Brock Lesnar and then you get some

820
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:19,490
crazy

821
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,030
results.

822
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,420
Yes.

823
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,720
Oh,

824
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,230
big time.

825
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,780
And the guy who doesn't have the,

826
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,660
the talent but had effort twice,

827
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:28,010
effort was applied twice.

828
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:33,200
We'll go as far as the man or woman
will go as far as they possibly could to

829
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:37,040
actualize their true potential
by committing themselves to,

830
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,070
to effort and not going,

831
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:40,221
well,

832
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:40,791
I can't do it.

833
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:41,480
So forget it.

834
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,060
By applying effort over
and over and over again.

835
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,560
And then once you've developed talent,

836
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,610
more effort to take that talent and
do something that twice used effort,

837
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,950
we'll get you as far as you possibly can.

838
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,761
If you say,

839
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:52,941
well,

840
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:53,990
I'm not gifted,

841
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:54,771
I'm not talented,

842
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:56,270
so I won't put in any effort.

843
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,740
You have no idea how far you can go.

844
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,860
So I absolutely cannot
beat Francis in Ghana,

845
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,020
but by not thinking that I'm too limited
by my jeans and continuing to apply

846
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:06,291
effort,

847
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,460
regardless of my jeans,

848
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:11,090
I can get to the best possible
place I can as an individual.

849
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,020
Do you know what I mean?

850
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,150
So I think that that on some,

851
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,920
you don't want to go down some road
that you cannot be accomplished,

852
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,640
but you also don't want to not go down
roads because you're not genetically

853
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:23,570
predisposed to them.

854
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:24,800
I think African get you somewhere.

855
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,190
It definitely can get you somewhere.

856
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,550
But I think what we're talking about here
is what I love about life is that it's

857
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:30,384
messy.

858
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:30,900
Yeah.

859
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,561
That there's not,

860
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:33,360
it's not one plus one is two,

861
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:33,700
isn't it?

862
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,130
There's not as Zeros and ones.

863
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:35,581
It's just,

864
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:36,960
there's a bunch of factors.

865
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,280
Does a lot of shit going on,

866
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:38,880
man.

867
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,430
And that's why when something
magical takes place,

868
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,271
when you get,

869
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:42,930
uh,

870
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,560
you know,

871
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:43,890
uh,

872
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,070
uh,

873
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,210
George Saint Pierre,

874
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:45,901
or when you,

875
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,340
you get a mighty mouse,

876
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,540
when you get someone who's like,

877
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:49,230
Whoa,

878
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,950
look at that,

879
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,430
like this,

880
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,700
there's so many factors
that lead you to be,

881
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,030
uh,

882
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,421
Gennady.

883
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:55,450
Golovkin yeah.

884
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,350
There's so many different
things have to fall into place.

885
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,450
Or here's a guy,

886
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:00,690
like,

887
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,890
how about Michael Bisping?

888
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Michael Bisping is just one of the
toughest motherfuckers ever example.

889
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:08,760
Yeah.

890
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,720
But you found the perfect,

891
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,110
yeah.

892
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,800
Michael Bisbing is one of the
toughest motherfuckers ever.

893
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,000
He's not extraordinarily
talented in any one form of MMA.

894
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,100
He's not like the fastest guy.

895
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:21,450
He's not the strongest guy.

896
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,350
He doesn't have this great background
in Brazilian Jujitsu where he's just a

897
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,670
worldclass strangler.

898
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:27,720
And if he gets your back,

899
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:28,554
you're fucked.

900
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,700
There's none of those things.

901
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,860
He's just tough as fuck.

902
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:34,410
And he's one of the most
mentally strong guys.

903
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,840
Like even Tim Kennedy who
was here the other day,

904
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,321
Tim Kenny,

905
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:37,740
he's like,

906
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:37,981
God,

907
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:39,180
I hate to give him a compliment.

908
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:39,381
Police.

909
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,070
So fucking tough can't,

910
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:41,940
you can't deny them.

911
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,160
You

912
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,630
can't.

913
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,090
So,

914
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,410
and,

915
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,910
and that goes right back to this,

916
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:49,911
and I think this is at the
root of questions about
life because Michael Bisbing

917
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,390
genetically tough.

918
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,140
Is he genetically mentally tough or
did he work really hard and just push

919
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:56,100
himself through things?

920
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:58,440
And that one day when it
got really fucking tough,

921
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,280
he didn't give up,

922
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,080
which taught him that
he shouldn't give up,

923
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:02,520
which taught him to go even further,

924
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,780
which made him push himself or was
it in all likelihood it's both.

925
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,930
But Michael Bisping free of that
effort to continue to because um,

926
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,570
oh,

927
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,380
what's his name?

928
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,180
Think of the mentally toughest guy that,

929
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,990
um,

930
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,411
I'm just,

931
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:17,700
I have a thing with names sometimes,

932
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,470
even names I know I'll describe.

933
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,830
Guy's got a chain and he's howling
and he's does it power slam.

934
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:23,890
But I can't think of ramping up.

935
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,200
I can't think of rampage,

936
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:25,720
but,

937
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,380
uh,

938
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,790
uh,

939
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,780
big elbows.

940
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,520
You've had him probably on the podcast,

941
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,200
a tough hairy chest.

942
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,343
Um,

943
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,283
uh,

944
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,661
who am I thinking?

945
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:36,790
I'm hundred and 70 pounds
fought Damien Maia,

946
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,050
Matt,

947
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,690
Matt Brown.

948
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,190
Oh yeah.

949
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,240
But that's an example.

950
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,570
I can literally say,

951
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,470
she could literally say all these things,

952
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:47,790
but the name will escape me.

953
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,100
It's a strange thing happens to me.

954
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,500
I worked with John Early in the morning,

955
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,250
right?

956
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,570
I worked with John Ramm Dean for you.

957
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:58,680
This is one of my best friends.

958
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,600
And he would literally
just see it in my eyes,

959
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,270
just like I won't have the name and I'll
throw out one or two of those factoids.

960
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:04,021
And he always had it.

961
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:04,854
It'd be like Matt Brown.

962
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,840
So that's why having good
friends with his great,

963
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,300
you'll know your pants.

964
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,143
Yeah.

965
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,550
Yeah.

966
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,990
But we've talking to Matt
Brown and on the phone,

967
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:13,170
I,

968
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:13,620
uh,

969
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,431
doing an interview with them.

970
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,060
I said,

971
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,860
you're one of the mentally
toughest guys there is.

972
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,694
And he said,

973
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,780
I don't think I am.

974
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,410
He said,

975
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,900
if I think I'm mentally
tough for one moment,

976
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,250
I will not do all of the things
necessary to walk in mentally tough.

977
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:26,910
He said,

978
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,620
he's like,

979
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:27,930
Ma,

980
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,460
I am not mentally tough.

981
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,870
The mental toughness is a result of all
of the hard work and preparation that I

982
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:36,150
have done to be able to
do it in that moment.

983
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,400
And you heard it in his voice.

984
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,050
He had no doubt that this was so,

985
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,090
and I think he's right.

986
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,530
I think he's right.

987
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,451
I think he's right too.

988
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:47,540
But he's also mentally tough him
because he also does those things.

989
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,750
But one of the things that about Matt
Brown that separates him is that that guy

990
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,480
empties out in the cage.

991
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,670
He separates himself
from the pack because he,

992
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,990
he's so for Roche bus like that
guys for Roche's remember when,

993
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,750
when he stepped into the
cage we were watching,

994
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,310
I think we're doing a fight companion,

995
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,490
but we're um,

996
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:11,050
maybe we were wearing it anyway when he
stepped into the cage and fought Diego

997
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,360
Sanchez when he,

998
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,860
when he stepped into the
octagon and screamed and roared,

999
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,630
it was literally like an animal.

1000
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,470
I mean it was,

1001
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:23,060
it was far verocity defined and
that's just how we fights man.

1002
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,040
That kind of just empties out.

1003
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,450
Like whatever the fuck he's guy.

1004
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,710
He's not holding anything back,

1005
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:27,921
man.

1006
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:28,021
He,

1007
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:29,090
he goes for it.

1008
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,240
And that's why I think when we
were talking about fight an art,

1009
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,880
to me that's an art of human expression.

1010
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,091
Like,

1011
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:39,210
I think that is to be a capable,

1012
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:39,481
I mean,

1013
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:40,790
whether you're um,

1014
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,000
you're doing jazz or punk rock,

1015
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,290
it's human expression.

1016
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,380
Whether are Matt Brown or
your some elegant mover.

1017
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,660
It's still the same art at its root.

1018
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,570
But you remember that elbow he fired
on Diego Sanchez and that's fine.

1019
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,500
It was there and there.

1020
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:55,810
The,

1021
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,300
these moments are there a
lot when you're analyzing,

1022
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:01,180
fighting and looking at it
from that other perspective,

1023
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,240
these fight ending moments are there.

1024
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:03,641
They're,

1025
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:06,400
there are way more often
than these guys realize,

1026
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,430
but when they spot them like
Matt did in that moment,

1027
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,150
this is,

1028
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,280
I have a free shot from an angle.

1029
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,350
Time has slowed down enough that I see it.

1030
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,800
I can see the little red arc of where
it's going and I'm going to put this,

1031
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,870
I'm going to end this fight.

1032
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,710
It,

1033
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,020
it's,

1034
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,550
there's a visceral like,

1035
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,950
like uh,

1036
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,170
it's period is when
people look at you see it,

1037
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,173
see?

1038
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,580
Yup.

1039
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,640
Just like that is fucking art to me.

1040
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:32,320
But watch the lefthand,

1041
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,710
the reach and the hold and it's like,

1042
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,660
there is no doubt with
what's happening here.

1043
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,043
There is no doubt.

1044
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,900
Diego Sanchez is another curious
example because he's also a guy who is

1045
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,010
ferocious,

1046
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,170
like a ferociously tough guy.

1047
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,590
But there's always been something about
his movements that makes him come up

1048
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,210
short against the best of the best.

1049
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,470
And I mean you're talking about a guy
who's so fucking mentally tough as well.

1050
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:03,910
Like I always bring his fight against
Jake Ellenberger who is a brutal knockout

1051
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:06,220
artists at one 70 and Diego really,

1052
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,230
I mean Diego fought at one 45 remember?

1053
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,480
And Diego really is a tweener.

1054
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,270
He's like a little too small for 55.

1055
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,430
I don't know how the fuck
he made it to one 45.

1056
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:19,210
He basically starved his body
away and probably did some error,

1057
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,530
irreversible damage.

1058
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,020
But he will was like,

1059
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:26,680
his movements are always
just shy of elite.

1060
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,260
And I've always wondered
what is that like?

1061
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,180
It's almost like even if you see that,

1062
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,320
go back to that clip again,

1063
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,211
but you don't have to.

1064
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:34,870
It's okay.

1065
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,960
But there's something about
even the way he steps,

1066
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:38,300
yeah,

1067
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,390
he's not stepping the way,

1068
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,541
uh,

1069
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:42,310
Tj Dillashaw steps.

1070
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,331
You know what I'm saying?

1071
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,164
He's,

1072
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,410
I see it as his sort of intention.

1073
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:48,490
It's his over into,

1074
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:49,031
Oh God,

1075
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:50,170
that is so nasty,

1076
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,760
nasty and so perfect.

1077
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,070
But I see he wants it badly.

1078
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:54,790
Like he is,

1079
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,200
he's over engaged.

1080
00:31:56,201 --> 00:32:00,940
I think it's psychological as much as
anything I would say in Albuquerque.

1081
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,810
Look at that.

1082
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,130
The placement of the left hand there,

1083
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,260
there's just no doubt where this is going.

1084
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,160
And it is the moment
that Matt Brown created,

1085
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,960
like he created that moment.

1086
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,293
Um,

1087
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,370
see hair chest to her charts.

1088
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,730
It's funny.

1089
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,860
That's one of my reminder cues,

1090
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:18,694
right?

1091
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,270
Uh,

1092
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,661
but,

1093
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:20,494
uh,

1094
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,340
I think so.

1095
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:24,370
I watched Diego train in
Albuquerque and I love the guy.

1096
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:24,730
Um,

1097
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,950
I was there doing interviewing Cobb,

1098
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:31,150
who is my favorite artists
probably to watch for many reasons.

1099
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:34,990
I'm not really sure exactly why people
can't tell you why their favorite band is

1100
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:35,561
their favorite band.

1101
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:36,160
But I can all,

1102
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,710
there are many things I can describe it,

1103
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,690
but I was there to interview
for Monster Zim Itsm a,

1104
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:46,410
a website in South Korea that
when I became a freelancer,

1105
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,060
they were like,

1106
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,800
we'd like to give you some work.

1107
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,071
I'm like,

1108
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:49,904
well that'd be amazing.

1109
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,923
We'd like you to go.

1110
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,370
He just fought do whole choice.

1111
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,200
We'd like you to go
interview Mr Cub Swanson.

1112
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:54,411
I'm like,

1113
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:55,250
this is bad ass.

1114
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,250
It's like my favorite fighter.

1115
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:57,350
I'm going to send me to Albuquerque.

1116
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,890
And then I hung out in the gym and analyze
them and watched and made notes about

1117
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:05,891
what I could and Diego try and super
intense and he like does everything super

1118
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,010
intense and and as much as he loves
yoga and the different types of Yoga and

1119
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,650
meditation has allowed
him to do it differently,

1120
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,480
that hyper intensity,

1121
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:19,280
I think that doesn't allow the sort
of soft relaxation that's necessary to

1122
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,870
really do what you're describing.

1123
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,083
You know?

1124
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,920
I know what you're saying.

1125
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,140
Like the one of the things that people
don't understand about striking hard and

1126
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:31,490
like having real power is that you're
not fully tense through the entire

1127
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:31,941
movement.

1128
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:36,710
There's a lot of parts of striking where
the momentum starts and you're almost

1129
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:38,120
like completely loose,

1130
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,300
like up until instance before the
point of contact and then it's playing.

1131
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,900
There's this,

1132
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,900
there's this weird thing
that real knockout artists
have that you don't see in

1133
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:53,750
these fucking tense windmill guys.

1134
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,430
Windmill guys are too tight.

1135
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,030
Totally.

1136
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,400
But a guy like Ray Robinson will throw up.

1137
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,511
Like there's a,

1138
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:03,980
there was a gene Fullmer ray Robinson
Kao clip from the other night.

1139
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,250
Uh,

1140
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:04,560
I was,

1141
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,460
I was watching online.

1142
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,520
I must have washed it
like 13 times in a row.

1143
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,870
But you watch them Landis,

1144
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,980
I think it was a left hook,

1145
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,210
but you watched the
punch land like cheeses,

1146
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:15,380
like the snap that that guy had.

1147
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,510
But that snap is not,

1148
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,643
it's not,

1149
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,660
it's not fully tense.

1150
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,590
Here it is right here.

1151
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,540
Like look how nice and soft ts.

1152
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,401
Yeah.

1153
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,300
Soft.

1154
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,400
Look at that lead.

1155
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,670
That left Hook right there.

1156
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,121
That one's,

1157
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:29,871
softens them up,

1158
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:30,704
ties him up.

1159
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,560
But everything is like
the way it's flowing.

1160
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:33,700
That,

1161
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,160
yeah,

1162
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,993
he's swimming.

1163
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,271
Yeah.

1164
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:36,104
I mean it's just,

1165
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,390
he was a amazing boxer,

1166
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:38,691
dude.

1167
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:42,470
And you're talking about a guy who had
like a hundred and something fights,

1168
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:42,800
right?

1169
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,100
It's,

1170
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,290
he's almost gentle.

1171
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,661
I like,

1172
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:46,070
he's soft is the right word.

1173
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,180
There's a suppleness.

1174
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:47,740
There's a,

1175
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,730
there's a calmness,

1176
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:50,650
there's a relaxation and mentally too,

1177
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:54,710
like you know that idea of there's a
storm going on and in the middle of their,

1178
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,600
this calm area,

1179
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,740
that gentleness,

1180
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:57,000
that,

1181
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,580
that calmness has to be in your
mind to allow you to do this.

1182
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,220
And that's where Diego is.

1183
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,503
Look at that.

1184
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,730
Come on man.

1185
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:05,710
Just look at this,

1186
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,350
that,

1187
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,880
that's fucking incredible.

1188
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,461
And I left,

1189
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:09,021
took right here.

1190
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:09,854
Here it is.

1191
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,310
Yeah.

1192
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,670
I mean,

1193
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,670
and even just to create that moment and
to see that moment and to set it up and

1194
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:20,030
lay traps and see when the
guys moving his hands down,

1195
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,320
see when he's coming forward.

1196
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,720
See is patterns and 10
they can do those things.

1197
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:24,120
Yup.

1198
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,710
Yup,

1199
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,190
Yup.

1200
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,810
But it's that kind of power in that
left hook that does not come from,

1201
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,313
that's just a,

1202
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,890
that's just this little
twist that he does.

1203
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,811
Like come on.

1204
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:38,010
But here

1205
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,020
it is right here in slow Mo Bang.

1206
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,900
And it's just hip and there's like,

1207
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,170
so I did,

1208
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm sure you saw it or I think you saw it.

1209
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:47,010
I did a little breakdown of your kicks.

1210
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,293
I did see that.

1211
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:48,871
And it's just,

1212
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:52,800
that's what I was zooming in on was
this double pulse and that's real.

1213
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,060
That's daddy is the neurology
of high athletic performance.

1214
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:57,570
Um,

1215
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,770
so I have these friends
that I've developed that
I've gathered over the years

1216
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,120
and I love what I do,

1217
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:03,450
man.

1218
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,580
Like I'm happy every single day.

1219
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,640
And a big part of it is I've met these
people that I have these conversations

1220
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:14,280
with and sometimes they're
very long and deep and,

1221
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,490
and they've some,

1222
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:19,800
I have friends that are a phd psychologist
and this one guy doctor Stu McGill.

1223
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,723
Do you know who he is?

1224
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,631
His name?

1225
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:21,931
Yeah.

1226
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:22,830
You've probably heard that name.

1227
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:26,010
I'm sure somebody has mentioned it
because you're around different athletic

1228
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,060
types of all types.

1229
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,650
He is the world's foremost
expert in the spinal cord,

1230
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:33,390
in neurology of athletic performance,

1231
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,380
spinal cord,

1232
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,720
the spinal cord and how and your neurology
and your nerves and how your nervous

1233
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:42,030
system and George St Pierre
has worked with him a lot.

1234
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:42,540
He,

1235
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,250
if you ask him about him this week,

1236
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,960
he would talk about them extensively.

1237
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:50,961
So doctor Stu and I became friends and
it's a big compliment because he sought

1238
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:56,091
me out based on seeing my work and saying
that guy knows some things I want to

1239
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:56,491
talk to him,

1240
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:58,620
which was a plaque and
deep compliment to me.

1241
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,040
And now we became friends and we chat
all the time and one of the things we

1242
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:06,810
constantly talk about is the double pulse
and neurology and people talk about a

1243
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,580
fast twitch fiber.

1244
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,510
It's not a fiber as that's just
terms we've started to hear.

1245
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,190
It's a fast twitch and neurology.

1246
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,461
It's,

1247
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:16,410
it's a base,

1248
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,360
a fast ball hitters have it.

1249
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,111
You know what I mean?

1250
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:24,111
That neurology where you you there's
a pulse of tension and then a complete

1251
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:27,780
relaxation until the pulse of tension.

1252
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:28,410
Again,

1253
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,590
the Bruce Lee's one inch punch
was the simple example of them.

1254
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,620
But that is how that is the neurology
of high athletic performance and that's

1255
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:39,120
what I zoomed in I when I was looking
at your kick cause you can see it quite

1256
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:39,900
clearly.

1257
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,770
There's the moment,

1258
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:41,604
there's the relaxing,

1259
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:41,950
those are,

1260
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,380
and it ends up being more of a whip.

1261
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,040
And stew,

1262
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,930
Doctor Stu has all these incredible
analogies because he's examined this in so

1263
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,490
many different angles and layers,

1264
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:53,100
which is the beauty of
analyzing anything for years.

1265
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,020
And he'll use terms
like you can't shoot a,

1266
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,010
a cannon out of a canoe and you
think about that and you're like,

1267
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:00,250
of course we can use all walk,

1268
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,350
but if it's tense and then
shoots or you can't push a rope,

1269
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:04,920
right?

1270
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,700
You push a rope,

1271
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,420
right?

1272
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,841
And so,

1273
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,820
but you can whip a rope through tension,

1274
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,800
relaxation and tension again.

1275
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:14,400
And that neurology is the
neurology of high performance.

1276
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,263
And George,

1277
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,890
you talked to George about neurology.

1278
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:21,210
He'll go deep down some shit to George
Saint Pierre because he studied this to

1279
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:24,360
understand himself and what he was
doing at a high level with doctors too.

1280
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,613
Um,

1281
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,830
but it is a fascinating
thing because when you think,

1282
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,360
we often will say,

1283
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:30,570
you know,

1284
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,480
fighting is 90% mental sipping.

1285
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:35,620
This cop is 100% mental.

1286
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,843
You know,

1287
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,170
my brain told my body
to reach out and do it.

1288
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:42,790
My brain made this choice.

1289
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:44,590
I activated everything.

1290
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:44,921
Use,

1291
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,150
it's all your brain,

1292
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,050
everything.

1293
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,510
And once you get to a
high level of performance,

1294
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,500
you know how to punch and kick and you
train like crazy and you make the things

1295
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,840
happen by themselves
almost by training so much,

1296
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:57,910
they take so little
attention in decision making.

1297
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,730
It becomes about maximizing
your nervous system,

1298
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,050
how your nervous system.

1299
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,000
And I think that's true
of almost anything.

1300
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,310
And that's not the steer right there.

1301
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,203
Yeah.

1302
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,570
Yeah.

1303
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,090
That Susie training with
the charge and doctors too.

1304
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,740
I couldn't see his face looks
like a bar graph and to be honest,

1305
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,940
yeah.

1306
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:18,850
But uh,

1307
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,571
that is got,

1308
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:20,770
I'm whipping the ball around.

1309
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:20,980
Yeah.

1310
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,140
I'm not sure exactly what he's doing
or why they're dumbbell presses,

1311
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,650
but I'll put you in touch with them often.

1312
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,720
So it's like a,

1313
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:31,080
it looks like he's got some heavy
weight at the end of a rope.

1314
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:31,831
Yeah.

1315
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:34,860
And I guess engaging the
core through the use of,

1316
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:35,670
you know,

1317
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,360
probably asking him to only engage
certain things to counter balance the

1318
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:40,194
movement

1319
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,721
prize,

1320
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:41,890
to see George waring,

1321
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,020
your typical a running shoe
when he's training with the,

1322
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,690
the thick heel.

1323
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:48,100
And you know,

1324
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,530
I'm still surprised to
this day when I see,

1325
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,310
uh,

1326
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,270
we're going to talk about neurology
and activating muscles and tissues.

1327
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:59,830
Like there's so many athletes is still
train with those big cushy bottomed

1328
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:00,664
running shoes.

1329
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,180
I mean,

1330
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,880
I think that is crazy victim.

1331
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,783
It's weird.

1332
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,000
Yeah,

1333
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,391
it's weird.

1334
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:04,631
I mean,

1335
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:06,430
you should be doing that
kind of shit barefoot,

1336
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,510
especially a fighter.

1337
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,800
You fight barefoot.

1338
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,020
You should be wearing
nothing on your feet.

1339
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,020
The only thing connecting you
to a stable surfaces your foot.

1340
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:15,590
Yeah,

1341
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,120
I agree 100%.

1342
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:17,810
Um,

1343
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,690
sometimes when we're trying
to make sense of these things,

1344
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,610
we go to multiple different
sort of perspectives of it.

1345
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:28,340
So I'll take what I learned
from Doctor Stu and,

1346
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,520
uh,

1347
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,750
he's just my friend now as well.

1348
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:33,020
So I like hanging out and chatting
with him about like way out there,

1349
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:33,980
aspects of these things.

1350
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,780
But you talked to Irwin
[inaudible] as well,

1351
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,370
who has a different sphere of connecting
to this kind of thing and Irwin starts

1352
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:44,870
with the foot and you've had our one
on the and he starts with the foot and

1353
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:45,591
everything else.

1354
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:46,251
It makes sense,

1355
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:46,431
right?

1356
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:50,750
I got to throw a punch and the important
part is going to be my foot through the

1357
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:51,141
leg,

1358
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:51,831
through the hip,

1359
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:52,661
through the core,

1360
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:52,930
and,

1361
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,190
and relaxed until the moment that it hits.

1362
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:56,270
But it all starts on

1363
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,360
nick.

1364
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,170
Nick's,

1365
00:40:59,170 --> 00:40:59,531
excuse me.

1366
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:02,470
When I asked Nick Curse on
about training athletes,

1367
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,453
like what's the,

1368
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,530
the thing that he thinks
fighter should work on the most?

1369
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:06,430
He's like foot strength.

1370
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,601
What?

1371
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:07,991
I was like,

1372
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:08,824
wow.

1373
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,521
And I thought about it.

1374
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:09,701
I'm like,

1375
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:09,970
whoa.

1376
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,541
Of course.

1377
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,170
Right.

1378
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,250
That's how you push off.

1379
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,270
That's how you move.

1380
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,720
I'll give,

1381
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,190
your feet are weak and they get tired.

1382
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:16,120
He can't move well,

1383
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,290
which I've experienced.

1384
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:18,340
I'm sure you've experienced,

1385
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,180
um,

1386
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,980
when your feet are weak and tired,

1387
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:21,581
like if you,

1388
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:25,030
if you don't run and then you try to run
one of the first things you get tired

1389
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:25,620
of your feet.

1390
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,340
Yeah.

1391
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,340
The very worst injury I've ever had in
my life by far was plantar fasciitis of

1392
00:41:32,101 --> 00:41:32,820
both feet.

1393
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,860
Oh my last fight.

1394
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,540
And I was through training and everything.

1395
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,720
And then I had my fight in Montreal
and the whole strategy was put,

1396
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,510
getting to a place where I could be
safe and use better knowledge of the

1397
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:49,190
situation to fatigue the other guy.

1398
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:49,881
So the whole,

1399
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:53,300
a lot of the seven or eight minutes
of the fight took place with me,

1400
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:54,530
pressuring him against the fence,

1401
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,970
just driving off both feet,

1402
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,610
pressuring against the fence
to try to land things are make,

1403
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,530
create lines for different weapons.

1404
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,120
And it's only eight minutes,

1405
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:04,640
but eight minutes of
intense drive from my feet.

1406
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,320
And then we went on vacation the very
next day and that night we grabbed

1407
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:13,130
Margarita's and we walked around the
resort and in my feet were destroyed for

1408
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,840
acutely,

1409
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,070
for three or four days.

1410
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:17,270
Like I couldn't walk.

1411
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,690
And the inflammation
was so unbelievably bad.

1412
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:21,560
It was like bricks.

1413
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,461
And,

1414
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:22,730
uh,

1415
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,730
even for months after it was visualized
him tried to ice ice or I would get in

1416
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:30,920
immediately into the cold pool and
spend the day in the cold pool drinking

1417
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:32,270
Tequila and hopes that it would help.

1418
00:42:32,271 --> 00:42:33,104
And it's kind of,

1419
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,663
yeah,

1420
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,900
foot pain is,

1421
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,210
that's one of the things that are hurt.

1422
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:44,211
Dominick Cruz in his comeback fight when
he fought Tj Dillashaw you notice he

1423
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:46,020
was like kind of limping a little.

1424
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,820
We were attributing it to the leg kicks.

1425
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,260
He said that's not the case.

1426
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:53,340
He said what was going on was he had
plantar fasciitis because you know he had

1427
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:58,430
multiple injuries that he was re re
recovering from during that training camp.

1428
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,740
And when he got knee surgery and he came
back from that and he tore his groin,

1429
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,500
he tried to like really
ramp up as training,

1430
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,780
who's doing a lot of sprinting and a
lot of different things with his feet.

1431
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,021
You know,

1432
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:13,650
cause obviously he's very
footwork intensive with his
fighting and he fucked his

1433
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:14,011
feet up.

1434
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:14,251
Man.

1435
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:17,910
His feet just weren't and conditioned to
do the kind of stuff that he used to be

1436
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:18,744
able to do.

1437
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,050
And the first thing he got was
plantar fasciitis shop had it too.

1438
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,790
He told me it was.

1439
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,540
That's one of the worst
things he's ever had.

1440
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,370
Think of this for the big picture
meaning of this far Dominic.

1441
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:34,580
So you got somebody else and they're going
about fighting and their their career

1442
00:43:35,671 --> 00:43:36,930
as a martial artist,

1443
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:40,950
a competitive fighter one way and
Dominic goes about it a different way and

1444
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,330
through Dominic's choices,

1445
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,200
moving training,

1446
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,053
footwork,

1447
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,270
he avoids a lot of the damage
that these guys will take,

1448
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,040
but you can't avoid,

1449
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,420
something's going to go right.

1450
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:52,590
So instead of taking,

1451
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,260
getting kicked a lot and punched in
the head and taking all those things,

1452
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,460
the training necessary to make that
not happen fucks up something else.

1453
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:01,110
Like you can't get away from it.

1454
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,780
You're going to work yourself
until your body gives up.

1455
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:08,990
Even dom brilliantly finding a way to
work outside of taking the damage that

1456
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:12,120
they take still could not get
away from damaging his body.

1457
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,190
Tj Dillashaw versus Cody Garbrandt.

1458
00:44:14,191 --> 00:44:16,920
The rematch is one of the most
intriguing fights of the year for me.

1459
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:17,910
I'm really,

1460
00:44:17,911 --> 00:44:22,560
really curious about that fight because
I know those guys were tightly matched

1461
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:27,150
in the gym and I know that Cody correct
him with a big right hand before TJ put

1462
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:27,930
him away.

1463
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,763
And so,

1464
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,590
and it was,

1465
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:30,060
yeah,

1466
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,590
he was stunned and he rocked.

1467
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,090
And I believe when Cody cracked and
it was towards the end of the round,

1468
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,630
he was,

1469
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,991
yeah.

1470
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,420
And so he had an opportunity to recover.

1471
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:39,601
I mean,

1472
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:43,500
who knows if he had caught that right
hand the first minute of the round what

1473
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:44,334
had gone on.

1474
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,140
But when Tj recovered from that and then
lend that head kick and then you know,

1475
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,730
knocked him out and put him away,

1476
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,540
you,

1477
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,010
you got to see like,

1478
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,490
oh,

1479
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,510
what a high level high stakes
game these two guys are playing.

1480
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,400
And you know,

1481
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:01,860
Tj has through bang,

1482
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:05,790
Ludwig has really radically
improved his movement,

1483
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:06,870
his footwork,

1484
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,681
his angles,

1485
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:08,514
his approach.

1486
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,630
He's so versatile with his
ability to switch stances,

1487
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,441
his ability,

1488
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:13,651
I mean,

1489
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:18,300
he's constantly cutting angles and
striking as he switching stances.

1490
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:21,270
And there's so much
information coming at you.

1491
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:22,320
If you're fighting him,

1492
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:22,740
your,

1493
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,300
your brain's overloaded.

1494
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:27,660
If you're not used to that and even
the guys who used to train with them,

1495
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:30,570
I believe in Alpha male are not
used to what he's doing now.

1496
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,660
I agree because it's a,

1497
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:32,494
it's at a,

1498
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,560
at a far higher level that said,

1499
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,400
Cody still has a fucking
missile in his right hand.

1500
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,200
It's so goddamn fast.

1501
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:43,140
His hand speed is so fast and his,

1502
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,160
his fluidity and efficiency
in his boxing is so good.

1503
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,390
It's just a very,

1504
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:49,620
very interesting fight for me.

1505
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,110
That's about as good as it gets right now,

1506
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:57,150
like from the raw materials of those
guys and the skills that they have.

1507
00:45:57,191 --> 00:46:00,440
But I am definitely
with you as far as that,

1508
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,500
my deep curiosity of the choices
of the coaches and because,

1509
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,050
and you talk to some
of them different ones,

1510
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:08,231
you know,

1511
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:13,090
I've got a few key friends that I talk
to on a very regular basis and so what it

1512
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:13,924
will take,

1513
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,230
what we would decide to do to train to
make our guy the best in the world or try

1514
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:19,750
to be the best in the world in 10 months.

1515
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,380
If we take a different strategy and we
start to build them to be the best in the

1516
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,550
world in three years,

1517
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,020
it's a different game.

1518
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,030
And that's what Dwayne,

1519
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,720
Dwayne is sad.

1520
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,090
We will and it's,

1521
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,640
it's fucking hard work for Dwayne to like,

1522
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,000
that's the thing that people
won't necessarily appreciate.

1523
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,331
They'd be like,

1524
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:37,441
oh,

1525
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:38,320
he's a brilliant coach.

1526
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,520
That's nonstop,

1527
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:44,521
constant searching and examining and
trial and error and reinterpreting his

1528
00:46:45,461 --> 00:46:47,650
language of understanding where the,

1529
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,140
where the chaos is and understanding,

1530
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,890
you know,

1531
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,790
can we make this guy believes something's
happening or are we too deep in it

1532
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,710
that he doesn't think that and it fails.

1533
00:46:56,711 --> 00:47:00,040
Like what levels of
misdirection or too deep,

1534
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,090
how good is he?

1535
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,340
And when I talked to them
leading up to that one,

1536
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:04,174
it was like,

1537
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:04,780
you know,

1538
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,780
the conversation was about
making Cody believe in,

1539
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,320
anticipate something wrong.

1540
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:13,540
And that's the root of all of all combat,

1541
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:13,751
right?

1542
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:17,230
Like you make me think this is coming
and I do this and he took me in the body.

1543
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,520
And the layers,

1544
00:47:18,521 --> 00:47:19,390
the multiple layers,

1545
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:20,200
like you just said,

1546
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,090
overloading the ability to,

1547
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,930
you're trying to catalog what's
coming and how you chunk that,

1548
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,650
uh,

1549
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,150
we don't necessarily understand.

1550
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,590
So your brain be going,

1551
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:29,801
okay,

1552
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:31,390
this is all the stuff from the left,

1553
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:33,730
which happens when this happened or the,

1554
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,100
the,

1555
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,620
the legs are doing this or you're running
algorithms in your brain and we don't

1556
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:38,830
know.

1557
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:39,970
I don't know what yours is.

1558
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,250
I don't know how you
categorize my threats.

1559
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:44,890
I don't know whether you categorize
anything from my right hand or anything in

1560
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:47,680
combination or if you're watching
the patterns of my shoulders,

1561
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,700
I have no idea.

1562
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:54,030
So Dwayne and anybody else playing with
this concept is trying to figure out how

1563
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:58,450
you'll read this and use that against you.

1564
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:59,171
And to me,

1565
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:00,004
that's the,

1566
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,150
the layer of complete mind
blowing nature that like,

1567
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:04,990
what did you say?

1568
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,040
Chess with dire consequences or problem.

1569
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:07,874
Solvable problems.

1570
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,431
Fucking hard.

1571
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:11,710
Those problems are now how many there are.

1572
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:12,790
That's the game.

1573
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:13,010
And,

1574
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,210
and it can be done at this level
because their skills are so good.

1575
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,230
They're minds are so good.

1576
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,340
They're physically so good,

1577
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,121
they're capable,

1578
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:19,811
they're fearless,

1579
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:20,561
they're confident,

1580
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:24,580
they have all of those raw materials and
now we're playing a game that most of

1581
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:29,581
us cannot comprehend and they've also
sparred countless hours to those each

1582
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:32,930
other and they've told each other
lies for long periods of time.

1583
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,360
Lies on lies.

1584
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,120
I one time went with a,

1585
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:39,610
I worked for a company called
the score fighting series.

1586
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,530
It was really a brilliant show.

1587
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:43,750
Like it was kind of Canada's Bella tour,

1588
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:47,500
like it was on the same network and
they aired Bella tour and it was very,

1589
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:49,540
very good developmental league stuff.

1590
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:54,760
And that company brought in Forrest
Griffin and then a bunch of poker players

1591
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,480
and they were on a train together
and and contest winners on the thing.

1592
00:48:58,481 --> 00:49:02,050
Got To ride on this train with Forrest
Griffin and a bunch of poker pup but high

1593
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:03,210
level pro poker players.

1594
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,010
And I was there and that was
the first time I met Forrest.

1595
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:07,150
And this is a killer,

1596
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:07,984
smart dude.

1597
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,710
But you watch these poker players who
are all riding together and they all know

1598
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:14,530
each other and they are just telling
each other lies all the time,

1599
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:18,280
trying to tell stories about things
that represent the fact that they are,

1600
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,270
you know,

1601
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:22,360
conservative when really they're risk
takers are trying to tell each other

1602
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:24,010
things that make them think they're crazy.

1603
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:28,000
But really they're calculating like they
are telling each other lies ongoing and

1604
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,410
they're gambling with each other and shit.

1605
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:30,940
It's a completely dejected,

1606
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,113
generative,

1607
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,740
but that's the kind of thing that's
happening on some level with these,

1608
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:40,000
the high level fighters to making them
think certain things about what they will

1609
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:43,120
do or believe they'll do
almost everything they say.

1610
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,290
Um,

1611
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:44,980
we should,

1612
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,980
the fans and the audience we should assume
is a game chip is like a something to

1613
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:50,530
make.

1614
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,110
The other one believes something
that might in that moment,

1615
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:54,310
let me land that kick.

1616
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,510
If he thinks that I'm,

1617
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,021
you know,

1618
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:56,561
whatever,

1619
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:56,850
right.

1620
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:01,850
It's manipulative stuff and at that
level that is just so unbelievably

1621
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:02,830
fascinating.

1622
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:03,610
It really is.

1623
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,131
It really is.

1624
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:05,710
In the stakes are so high and you know,

1625
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,270
the kick lands your hero,

1626
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,460
the kick misses and you get
caught with a left hook,

1627
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:10,294
you're a loser.

1628
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:10,691
You know,

1629
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:14,920
there's just so much at stake with
every single choice you make and all,

1630
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:19,690
all those choices have to be almost
subconscious or semi-conscious because

1631
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:21,010
you've got to be in the Zen state,

1632
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,970
you gotta be flowing.

1633
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:23,920
So everything has to be prepared.

1634
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:24,963
You have to have,

1635
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:25,983
you know,

1636
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,740
while you're in there,

1637
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:28,010
you have

1638
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,090
to have no regrets.

1639
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:32,720
You have to be able to just flow and
you have to be able to capitalize on any

1640
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:33,230
movement,

1641
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:33,501
any,

1642
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:34,311
any opening.

1643
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:37,850
You say you got to pounce and they have
to be in condition to execute all these

1644
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:38,390
things.

1645
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,030
So you have to have had the
physical discipline and the
mental fortitude to push

1646
00:50:42,031 --> 00:50:45,050
yourself through training to a level
that you probably didn't think you could

1647
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:45,884
get to.

1648
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:46,530
And,

1649
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,540
and I want to pounce with the opening,

1650
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,070
but what if it's a lie?

1651
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:50,680
Right?

1652
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,141
Right.

1653
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:51,600
Like,

1654
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,750
what if Matt Brown slot line
on that thing was actually,

1655
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:56,290
that one would be hard to be alive,

1656
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:59,310
but there are other ones where it feels
like that one little opening but instead

1657
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:02,790
Tj is going to catch you or Cody's
lined you up to draw you into something.

1658
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,750
So God damn fast to his
hand speed is so ridiculous.

1659
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:07,111
He fasts,

1660
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:10,650
I go back to the Tom saw modified and
Almeda has really never been the same

1661
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,390
again.

1662
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,710
I'll made it going into
that fight was undefeated,

1663
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:17,460
was thought to be the dark horse of the
division like w look or future world

1664
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:18,210
champion.

1665
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,340
And Cody lit him up like a Christmas tree.

1666
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,870
And the way he did it was so
definitive that you like Jesus.

1667
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:28,800
Like there could be no doubt this guy
has real world championship potential.

1668
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,641
You know?

1669
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:34,641
And I think that the Duane Ludwig
factor is so fucking huge or really,

1670
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:35,690
really do.

1671
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,280
And I,

1672
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:36,600
I,

1673
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,150
I've seen Dwayne's work in like Dwayne,

1674
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:45,170
unlike a lot of guys has notebooks like
binders full of ideas and his system is

1675
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:48,460
a,

1676
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,030
it's a very declared system.

1677
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,270
It's not like loosely based work.

1678
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,780
We always work off the jab.

1679
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,820
We've got good footwork,

1680
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,100
none.

1681
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:56,760
There's none of that.

1682
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,310
No.

1683
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,400
Like there's a system to his,

1684
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:04,401
like he has a belt system to his style
and his style is based on for people

1685
00:52:05,281 --> 00:52:06,114
don't know.

1686
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,140
Dwayne was a worldclass kickboxer
worldclass Muay Thai fight.

1687
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:11,490
I mean fought Ramon Dekkers,

1688
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,050
I mean fought some of
the best of the best,

1689
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,920
had some amazing fights in
both MMA and in kickboxing.

1690
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:22,190
And he was a really talented guy and
then transitioned on to being a coach.

1691
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:27,261
And the obsession that he has towards
coaching is really at a higher level than

1692
00:52:28,441 --> 00:52:30,150
even his obsession towards fighting.

1693
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:31,160
And he talks about that,

1694
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:33,630
that his passion is teaching people.

1695
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:34,464
He loves it.

1696
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:39,450
He loves being able to mold students
and he's found the perfect muse or the

1697
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:43,610
perfect willing participant
in Tj and teaching him.

1698
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:48,611
I have a very unique friendship and
very unique student mentorship sort of

1699
00:52:49,591 --> 00:52:50,221
relationship.

1700
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:51,030
It's really,

1701
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,950
really interesting to watch
the two of them together.

1702
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,600
Wild.

1703
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,590
Now the the Super Jam with
20 guys and then you've got,

1704
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,280
uh,

1705
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,320
and Dwayne has tons of athletes too,

1706
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:00,670
but,

1707
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,140
but a commitment and connection to Tj.

1708
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,000
Then you've got Matt Hume and Demetrius,

1709
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:07,820
like you've got a few of
these guys who are just like,

1710
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:08,181
we,

1711
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:09,014
you,

1712
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,740
we will funnel all of my experience
through everything through this super

1713
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:13,310
athlete.

1714
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,320
But like you talk about those books,

1715
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:20,480
the only way that you get to a point of
this level of mastery that we're talking

1716
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:25,481
about is that you must go
down some fucking road for
six months that amounts to

1717
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:30,420
nothing so that you learned that road
isn't the road and the only way and you

1718
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:31,680
can't give up too worldly.

1719
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,660
And what if by going down at long enough,

1720
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:36,930
some different concept about how you
switch your feet in a certain moment.

1721
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,000
You think maybe that ain't it.

1722
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,080
But you have discovered that by pushing
through some of these concepts long

1723
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:43,291
enough,

1724
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:46,410
you find it so you stick with it
long enough and it turns out no.

1725
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,970
Dwayne and or anybody else reaching
that level of mastery has gone down some

1726
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:55,200
rabbit hole for months or
years and discovered the
only value they got out of it

1727
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:55,501
was,

1728
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:55,800
well no,

1729
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,960
there's lots of value that
wasn't the rabbit hole.

1730
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,490
And the,

1731
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,360
the process of searching this rabbit hole
has made me better at searching rabbit

1732
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:03,780
holes.

1733
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,190
So those two values,

1734
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,420
some of the stacks of his books are things
that didn't work and he will probably

1735
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:11,670
appreciate those just as much
as any of the ones that did.

1736
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,480
It was also,

1737
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,310
Tj is approach is really interesting
to me because Tj is obsessed with

1738
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:22,311
improvement and knowledge and he keeps
talking about his fight Iq and you know,

1739
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:23,220
him and Dwayne,

1740
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:24,001
I've been around them,

1741
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:24,870
I've trained with them,

1742
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:25,681
I've worked out with him,

1743
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:28,710
I watched him coach Tj and I mean they're,

1744
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:31,080
they're constantly working on the minutia.

1745
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:36,090
They're constantly working on finite
details and improving every single aspect

1746
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:38,700
and tightening things up.

1747
00:54:38,701 --> 00:54:40,300
And it's really interesting.

1748
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,300
Tj is a fucking open book man.

1749
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:42,601
I mean,

1750
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:42,841
he's,

1751
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:43,230
uh,

1752
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:43,800
he's,

1753
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,251
he,

1754
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:48,230
you can talk to that guy about
anything and he's considering it.

1755
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,350
He's thinking and he's like,

1756
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:49,741
oh,

1757
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:50,041
okay,

1758
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:50,731
I see what you're doing.

1759
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:51,564
I see what you're doing.

1760
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,111
Like he's,

1761
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:54,930
he's a guy who's always
trying to take in information,

1762
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,110
you know,

1763
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:56,710
that's,

1764
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:01,710
so these are the things when
we do watch this kind of thing,

1765
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:06,850
whether it is martial arts or even
your jazz or football or whatever,

1766
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,040
there are these lessons that are there,

1767
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:09,520
like,

1768
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,720
we should do that.

1769
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,240
My corresponds to go
through life doing that.

1770
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:15,250
We're not supposed to look
at Tj Dillashaw and go,

1771
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:15,641
wow,

1772
00:55:15,641 --> 00:55:16,331
isn't that crazy,

1773
00:55:16,331 --> 00:55:16,750
that guy,

1774
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:17,620
if we do that,

1775
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:18,730
our lives will get better.

1776
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:19,564
Right?

1777
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,160
I got two.

1778
00:55:21,161 --> 00:55:24,130
So I get to work for Tsn in Canada,

1779
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:26,320
which is like ESPN at
in the states and we,

1780
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:29,640
I'm myself and Aaron broadens that
are like the two person division.

1781
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,590
It talks about about a UFC and fighting.

1782
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,083
And uh,

1783
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,103
we,

1784
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:35,500
uh,

1785
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,840
they went and when George
was fighting Michael,

1786
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,591
they went and said,

1787
00:55:38,591 --> 00:55:39,370
you know,

1788
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,680
could you approach your friends
with George and his people?

1789
00:55:41,681 --> 00:55:44,800
Could you approach them about doing a
half hour long documentary on him about

1790
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,480
his comeback and training and stuff?

1791
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:48,310
And I did.

1792
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,040
And at first George was open to
it and is Rudolph has manager.

1793
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:52,331
I was like,

1794
00:55:52,331 --> 00:55:52,661
Oh God,

1795
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:54,970
I hear the word documentary
and I know what that means.

1796
00:55:54,971 --> 00:55:57,550
It's going to be months and is going
to be cameras and it's going to be a

1797
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:58,631
distraction.

1798
00:55:58,631 --> 00:55:59,464
I said,

1799
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,270
I'll just travel with George
and I have the best producer,

1800
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:03,671
Simon,

1801
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:07,330
the best producer we have and we'll just
travel with them and they said yes and

1802
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:09,850
so I got to travel with
George for a month,

1803
00:56:09,851 --> 00:56:12,010
six weeks off and on New York,

1804
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:12,903
La,

1805
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,500
Montreal life eating ice cream
train with Freddie Roach.

1806
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,051
Yeah.

1807
00:56:18,051 --> 00:56:18,884
Yeah.

1808
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,830
When is this going to come out?

1809
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,940
It did come up before,

1810
00:56:21,941 --> 00:56:23,020
so mostly in Canada,

1811
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,440
but I'm going to send a message.

1812
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,270
I'm going to send a message immediately
after we get off here to Simon and the

1813
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:28,841
rest of them and say,

1814
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:30,160
where is that right now?

1815
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:30,850
And then I'll,

1816
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:32,560
I'll tweet it out because
did learned a lot.

1817
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,820
Oh Man.

1818
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:34,750
It changed my life,

1819
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:35,590
like yeah,

1820
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,570
because you don't get to be around the
greats of the greats and study them and

1821
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:41,321
we're friends.

1822
00:56:41,321 --> 00:56:43,940
So I can talk to him
like we hang out here,

1823
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,660
I got to fucking train
karate with his team,

1824
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:48,160
like point karate,

1825
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:48,830
you know,

1826
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,500
so it'd be all Robbins
training with us today.

1827
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,630
What kind of point karate
training do they do?

1828
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:54,790
And do they do this to
practice like blitzing?

1829
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:55,600
Yep.

1830
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,090
And just think of this like an eye.

1831
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,670
You were big on point karate like 2012,

1832
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:05,560
2013 and I didn't disagree
but I didn't really get there.

1833
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:06,394
It is.

1834
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,150
There it is.

1835
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:07,450
Yeah.

1836
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:08,620
It uh oh fuck.

1837
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:10,480
It was so magical to see like,

1838
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,280
and I wasn't just like how does he kick?

1839
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:12,581
And I'm like,

1840
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:13,414
how does he,

1841
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,970
why does he do the things he does and why?

1842
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:16,990
What's his motivation?

1843
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:19,540
And it really made me a better
human being getting to do that.

1844
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:20,440
But um,

1845
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,371
so what,

1846
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,240
I didn't really connect to a sit.

1847
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,920
Sometimes there's something so simple
and we don't see it cause we're in,

1848
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:27,531
we're deep in,

1849
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:28,390
up whatever we're in.

1850
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:32,380
But the idea of point karate
people right away and say,

1851
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:32,561
well,

1852
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:33,640
they're just touching each other.

1853
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:34,720
It's like a true,

1854
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,160
so if I'm training to just touch you,

1855
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:36,941
I'm not trying to hurt you.

1856
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:37,121
Okay.

1857
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,860
That seems like that's not valuable,

1858
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,450
but you're training to not,

1859
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:42,880
let me even fucking touch you.

1860
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:43,330
Right?

1861
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,190
If you can't get touched by me,

1862
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:45,910
how hard,

1863
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,650
impossible as it for me to hit you clean.

1864
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:48,791
You know what I mean?

1865
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,650
If your movement and your,

1866
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,740
your defensive systems and
your management of the,

1867
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,940
of the distance between our weapons and
targets are such that I can't fucking

1868
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:58,780
touch you.

1869
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,890
How can I hurt you?

1870
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:00,580
Right.

1871
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,810
If I can't even like get
touchy with my glove.

1872
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:02,890
Well,

1873
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:03,723
the thing is,

1874
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:09,190
here's what I think about point fighting
and what I think was valid about it is

1875
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:12,070
if you're just doing point
fighting with a point fighter,

1876
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,600
it is extremely frustrated.

1877
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:17,260
I fought in point fighting tournaments
when I was competing and we,

1878
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,123
there was,

1879
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,870
I came from a full contact taekwondo
background and we fought in these

1880
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:25,990
tournaments and the object was to knock
people unconscious and you would fight,

1881
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,260
you know there were three minute rounds
and you would fight and you would try to

1882
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:30,620
kick people into another time.

1883
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,490
A similar in Canada when it says what we,

1884
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,660
there was a lot of people that are
trained with that openly dismissed point

1885
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:38,320
fighting.

1886
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,020
And the reason why they openly dismissed
point fighting was cause they would

1887
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:43,180
stop every time someone would get touched.

1888
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,231
And I would be like,

1889
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:47,200
well in the real world or everybody
would say in the real world,

1890
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,150
you don't just stop when you get touched,

1891
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:50,470
you keep fighting.

1892
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,910
And so with our techniques,

1893
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:52,570
a lot of it,

1894
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,900
you would hit someone once and they would
counter it and then you'd set up the

1895
00:58:55,901 --> 00:58:56,950
big shot afterwards.

1896
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:58,360
Like this is part of the thing.

1897
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,760
And if the the referee kept stopping you,

1898
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,530
then you would never get anything done.

1899
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:07,390
But my thinking once I
got into MMA was okay.

1900
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:07,931
Yeah.

1901
00:59:07,931 --> 00:59:11,860
But if you can do that
and do the other things,

1902
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:15,310
it's like people dismiss
taekwondo because there were like,

1903
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:16,240
we'll talk window.

1904
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:16,650
He,

1905
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:16,900
you know,

1906
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,280
you get taken to the ground,

1907
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:19,720
you get your legs kicked out.

1908
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,583
Absolutely.

1909
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,280
But if you have

1910
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,280
takedown defense and you know Moitai
you can wheel kick someone into another

1911
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,240
fucking dimension.

1912
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:31,910
And we saw that with Edson
Barboza versus Terry Edom.

1913
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:36,470
We've seen these taekwondo techniques
manifest themselves in MMA and you realize

1914
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:36,650
like,

1915
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,190
oh,

1916
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,760
these are some of the most powerful
things you could do to a person inside a

1917
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:41,594
cage.

1918
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,560
But when you see the point fighting style,

1919
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,530
they'll like the Raymond Daniels
or the Michael Venom page.

1920
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:52,430
This ability to blitz if they
can do those other things too.

1921
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,780
This is another,

1922
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,831
another level.

1923
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:55,551
There's something to it.

1924
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,050
So as a fighter,

1925
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:01,670
I wasn't willing to dismiss point fighting
because I had been lied to already.

1926
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,121
I,

1927
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:05,720
when I went and took taekwondo
and then started kickboxing,

1928
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,640
first American kickboxing above the waist,

1929
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:11,360
first thing I realized is how easy it
was for me to get punched in the face.

1930
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:12,110
I was like,

1931
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:12,890
oh,

1932
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:13,341
okay.

1933
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:17,030
Now if I'm trapped in this ring and I
can't go anywhere and someone's throwing

1934
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,980
punches and I don't understand
how to get away from him,

1935
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:21,950
and I'm used to this taekwondo
style of having your hands down low,

1936
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:22,940
I'm getting fucked up.

1937
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,780
So I've been lied to.

1938
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:25,550
Talk Window is not the best martial art.

1939
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,450
None of the Ma.

1940
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:26,661
Yeah,

1941
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:27,580
there's exactly,

1942
01:00:27,581 --> 01:00:27,920
I'm nothing.

1943
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,370
Exactly.

1944
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:29,460
There is no best much.

1945
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:33,710
There's something absolutely
legit about that blitz,

1946
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,280
that karate blitz that
some of these guys can do.

1947
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:41,300
And I fought some really good guys and
those karate style tournaments in and I

1948
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,800
got an ass made out of me.

1949
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:43,671
I mean you,

1950
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:45,170
you don't know what to do.

1951
01:00:45,171 --> 01:00:48,830
Like and you get kicked and then
the referees point and you're like,

1952
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,970
you don't have a chance to fire back
because they're separating you guys.

1953
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,180
And I really absorb those lessons.

1954
01:00:56,181 --> 01:00:57,890
And I was like in MMA,

1955
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,200
that ability to close the
distance because every,

1956
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:02,450
in MMA there's so many guys,

1957
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,950
and Connor talked about this,

1958
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,070
there's so many guys that have
this Moy Thai stance and they're,

1959
01:01:07,071 --> 01:01:07,990
they're presenting,

1960
01:01:07,991 --> 01:01:09,350
it's very predictable target.

1961
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,610
They're standing right
in front of each other.

1962
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,790
And I think this stance
and especially this,

1963
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:14,990
the uh,

1964
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:15,741
change,

1965
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:16,031
the,

1966
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:16,200
the,

1967
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,090
the forward stance is one of the
reasons why [inaudible] has been caught,

1968
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:23,000
knocked out twice with front
kicks because he squares off.

1969
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:28,320
I veto explained this to me in like
Shit 1997 when I was training at Carlson

1970
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:31,040
Gracie's,

1971
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,540
he was explaining that,

1972
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:32,841
you know,

1973
01:01:32,841 --> 01:01:37,370
some kickboxers are going to have a hard
time in MMA even though they're really

1974
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:40,160
good kickboxers because the MMA stance,

1975
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:42,140
you really have to square off more.

1976
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,670
You can't stand like this.

1977
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:45,110
You can't stand like a boxer.

1978
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,110
And a kickboxer is a little
more open than a boxer.

1979
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,420
But then MMA is a little
more open than that.

1980
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:50,751
He's like,

1981
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:52,070
you almost have to be square,

1982
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:57,190
but that's square leaves you open to
front kick to the face and then turning

1983
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,031
side kicks in.

1984
01:01:58,031 --> 01:01:59,030
Side kicks to the body.

1985
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,650
Think about what Vito
has been dropped with.

1986
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,810
Jon Jones dropped him with
a side kick to the body.

1987
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:03,800
Soccer.

1988
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,950
Robert dropped him with a turning side
kick to the body to front kicks with

1989
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:07,850
front kicks to the face.

1990
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,340
It's because he presents
this square thing.

1991
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,080
But to him this is sprawl and throw
punches and throw that the like the blitz

1992
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:18,380
that we used on Vandelay Silva
and it worked much of his career.

1993
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,070
He either with it or lost

1994
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,281
with it.

1995
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:20,430
Yeah.

1996
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,080
And I'm have respect that thinking.

1997
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:27,290
But those types of doctrines
like is literally and in
martial arts in day to day

1998
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:30,780
life in anything,

1999
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,790
if you think anything is the other thing,

2000
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,720
you're totally wrong,

2001
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:34,140
right?

2002
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,360
Because if we all agree it's the thing,

2003
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:37,950
then we all acting like it's the thing,

2004
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:40,590
then we all start ignoring other
things and those things will work.

2005
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,000
So if you have to,

2006
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,700
if MMA you have to square up,

2007
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,040
all of a sudden some guy,

2008
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:48,410
some Connor comes out with a
different thing and you were wrong.

2009
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:53,820
That the guard is the one that is
glaring to me right now because,

2010
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,990
and I mean I've talked to some of the
smartest and the best and they will,

2011
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,640
and we do this over and over again.

2012
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,930
And we do it in everything.

2013
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:01,621
You know,

2014
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:02,390
you remember when you,

2015
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:03,030
you're,

2016
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,370
you cannot cross your feet
when you do an arm bar.

2017
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,061
Do you remember that?

2018
01:03:06,061 --> 01:03:07,360
Or like what the fuck,

2019
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,213
what are you talking about?

2020
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:10,531
Head kicks.

2021
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:11,640
Don't work in MMA.

2022
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:12,640
Like you know,

2023
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,100
this has been going on forever.

2024
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,020
Any absolute decision that this is
a fundamental rule is completely,

2025
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,270
that's where you're going to get fucked.

2026
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,400
And how about the low calf kick?

2027
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:23,820
Yeah,

2028
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,250
I mean the look Benson
Henderson was in my opinion,

2029
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:31,251
the first guy to bring him and he started
doing that back in the day but not to

2030
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:32,280
the effectiveness,

2031
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,290
the level of effectiveness
that we're seeing now.

2032
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,630
That low calf kick his fucking people.

2033
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,490
Oh that's really interesting.

2034
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,740
And then they'll adapt
and then it won't work.

2035
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:41,940
But that adaptation,

2036
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:43,980
we'll put something else available.

2037
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:48,270
Think of the problem with the low calf
kick is that you really can't condition

2038
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:51,030
the lower part of your leg the
same way you can your thighs.

2039
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,860
And I think it's going to keep working,

2040
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,630
but then we ask them to not get hit by it.

2041
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,780
So we'll make a change to not
get hit by and once we do,

2042
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,540
that'll force us to do something else
that someone will take advantage.

2043
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,120
It's amazing how quickly it works.

2044
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,580
Like if you see a guy get
hit with a brutal leg kick,

2045
01:04:05,581 --> 01:04:08,490
like it takes one or two and
then they start to feel it.

2046
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,500
There's something about
the first low calf kick.

2047
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:12,180
You see guys wobbly like that.

2048
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,190
That muscle is like really done.

2049
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:19,280
The insertion at the bottom is so small
and it's taking so much work like it's

2050
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:21,510
carrying so much.

2051
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,320
Yeah,

2052
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,100
it's,

2053
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,710
it's,

2054
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:26,220
and these are when things
work beautifully and again,

2055
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,610
like I used to take anything we would
talk about and I'd bring it back to

2056
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:30,300
fighting.

2057
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,990
Now I tend to take anything and fighting
and I tried to figure out what it means

2058
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:34,600
in life.

2059
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,410
Like I've kind of swell
over time of study.

2060
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,030
I've started to to do that.

2061
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:39,900
Right.

2062
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,820
And this is true of this kick can.

2063
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:42,601
It's true of anything.

2064
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:47,601
It's like the w w it works best when the
physiological truth that calf is small

2065
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:52,200
and weak and then works
with the systemic issue.

2066
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,680
He's got his foot there and the way he's
standing as such that you can hit it to

2067
01:04:55,681 --> 01:05:00,681
those two things together are making
that thing work right now if you can't

2068
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:02,610
change the strength of the calf.

2069
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:06,450
So the only thing we can change is how
available that calf kick is if we don't

2070
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:07,284
want to get hit with it.

2071
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,880
So we must change that.

2072
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:09,750
And if we do,

2073
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:13,080
we've changed a lot of different things
and now something else is available that

2074
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:17,260
Dwayne or Duke or somebody
else's already planning how to,

2075
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:22,300
how to take advantage that you've made
that adaptation and that that is for me

2076
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:24,340
what is eternally fascinating
about martial arts.

2077
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:24,790
But again,

2078
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:25,360
dots,

2079
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,550
those are the lessons
of life that are there.

2080
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:32,230
If you can't see that the world around
you has changed dramatically and you act

2081
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:33,340
as if it's the same,

2082
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:34,020
uh,

2083
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:34,853
you get fucked up,

2084
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,070
you will get fucked up.

2085
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:36,920
You know,

2086
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,410
I bring this to Paul daily
versus John Fitch because,

2087
01:05:40,411 --> 01:05:40,890
um,

2088
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:45,890
that fight was extremely frustrating to
Paul Daley and frustrating to a lot of

2089
01:05:45,991 --> 01:05:47,190
people that were watching it too.

2090
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,480
Cause John Fitch was just able to take
him down and kind of do what John Fitch

2091
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:56,130
does and hit him on the ground and kind
of beat him up and control the position.

2092
01:05:56,131 --> 01:05:56,361
And,

2093
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:57,001
and you know,

2094
01:05:57,001 --> 01:05:59,290
at the end of the fight
Paul's yell and boom,

2095
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,330
he seals.

2096
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:01,440
It was so strange,

2097
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,130
you know?

2098
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:02,700
And,

2099
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,930
but this is a guy that if
you just stand with him,

2100
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,670
he's going to fuck you up.

2101
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:12,000
Like if you just decide to trade
shots with Paul daily on your feet,

2102
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:15,090
he's got a left hand that is
a goddamn nuclear missile,

2103
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,421
you know,

2104
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:16,770
and he basically,

2105
01:06:16,771 --> 01:06:18,930
everybody he hits with that
thing goes night night.

2106
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:19,501
It's scary.

2107
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:20,610
Even Lorens Larkin,

2108
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,470
who's a seasoned striker,

2109
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:23,940
he got clipped by that left hand.

2110
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:24,181
It's like,

2111
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:25,014
Yo,

2112
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:26,200
the ability to make,

2113
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:30,790
generate and create that
amount of impact is elegant.

2114
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,653
It's like,

2115
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,680
it's like we are human bodies and minds
don't do all that many things that are

2116
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:41,800
that unbelievably beautiful and
rooted in our history as human beings.

2117
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:42,491
You know what I mean?

2118
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:47,491
This is at the basis of what it was to
survive and protect and expand and stuff.

2119
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:49,480
And you see it right there.

2120
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:51,880
When Paul Daley hits
somebody like it's unreal.

2121
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,730
The opposite of that scenario is,

2122
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:55,540
um,

2123
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:59,830
Johnny Hendricks was fighting Stephen
Thompson and Johnny Hendricks wanted,

2124
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,090
when Stephen would come in,

2125
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:04,950
he wanted to drill him with hooks and
upper cuts and then get to his body and to

2126
01:07:04,951 --> 01:07:06,250
take him down and do what,

2127
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:06,731
what,

2128
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,290
uh,

2129
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:07,480
uh,

2130
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,313
John Fitch did.

2131
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,460
But Steven's like,

2132
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:10,840
you're not doing that.

2133
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,260
And after he kicked him and beat him up
at distance and then finish the fight,

2134
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,020
Johnny was being
interviewed and he's like,

2135
01:07:17,021 --> 01:07:17,161
well,

2136
01:07:17,161 --> 01:07:17,994
that wasn't my knife.

2137
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:21,940
And Johnny is a classy guy overall
over the length of his career,

2138
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,170
he sometimes gets heat,

2139
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:23,891
but who cares,

2140
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:24,140
right?

2141
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,400
Like the opinion of the people
shouldn't matter to Johnny Hendricks.

2142
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,290
But Johnny said after he said,

2143
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:29,411
well,

2144
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:31,960
I was kinda hoping he'd
come in trade a little more.

2145
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:32,500
It's like,

2146
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,060
why the fuck would he do that?

2147
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,260
That's not his style.

2148
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,030
And that's what you want.

2149
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,040
He wants to do what you don't want.

2150
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:44,050
The whole goal is to do something that
benefits him in the scenario and does not

2151
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:44,651
benefit you,

2152
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:45,940
which would be exactly what he did,

2153
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:46,751
which is why,

2154
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:50,870
what brings you back to the Paul Daley
John Fitch fight like this is the answer

2155
01:07:50,871 --> 01:07:51,800
to that style,

2156
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:56,880
the answer to that styles take you
down and not ever let you get up and,

2157
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:59,780
and force John Fitches game on you,

2158
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,090
which is what makes
fighting so interesting.

2159
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,830
If John Fitch had just decided to go
cowboy and bite down his mouthpiece and

2160
01:08:06,831 --> 01:08:10,460
just wing punches that Paul daily
until one of them went to sleep,

2161
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,560
that would have been a
great fight for Paul Dalian.

2162
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:13,170
Great.

2163
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:13,470
China.

2164
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:13,950
Um,

2165
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:16,070
when Nick Diaz and Paul Daley did that,

2166
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,690
that was pretty happy and
that only happens again.

2167
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:25,750
You're creating a moment and it only
happens because nick was motivated by who

2168
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:28,280
he is in that moment.

2169
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:30,740
He wasn't motivated by
strategy even necessarily.

2170
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:31,011
He's like,

2171
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:31,850
fuck you.

2172
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:34,130
Like fuck you.

2173
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,970
And that however people will look at that.

2174
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:38,481
That is,

2175
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:38,870
again,

2176
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:41,690
it is an expression of the individuality,

2177
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:44,510
the authentic truth of who Nick Diaz is.

2178
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,310
That's why that's art.

2179
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,080
[inaudible] art and fight.

2180
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,220
That's a fight.

2181
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,440
This was got a fight,

2182
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:52,710
but that's a little bit of this.

2183
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,410
He just,

2184
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:55,910
he just kept the pace.

2185
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,230
He's just refusing.

2186
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,450
Paul just got too tired too quick.

2187
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,930
He was,

2188
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:03,560
he was willing and big shots
and look at Nick just oh damn.

2189
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:04,370
Right.

2190
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,031
He got clipped.

2191
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:06,640
That's his left hook you're talking about.

2192
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:06,950
Yeah,

2193
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:07,551
this is over.

2194
01:09:07,551 --> 01:09:07,761
Okay.

2195
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:08,361
It's all right there.

2196
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:08,780
We're done.

2197
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:09,081
No,

2198
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:10,520
cause nick won't be done.

2199
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,653
Well,

2200
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:12,411
I mean,

2201
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:12,981
who knows me.

2202
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:14,600
It was Paul's in better condition.

2203
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,890
But this is the end.

2204
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,930
The end is nick just battering him.

2205
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,570
It's crazy that he beat
him his striking contest.

2206
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,060
But he did it with Wale.

2207
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:24,680
He was always a great boxer.

2208
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:25,910
But I mean,

2209
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:26,721
and again,

2210
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:27,111
we're this,

2211
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:29,090
we're this a metaphor for life.

2212
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,910
Like you got a wall or the
greatest victories ever.

2213
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,470
The quintessential Nick Diaz fight.

2214
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,713
You're get to look at them.

2215
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:38,301
I know,

2216
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:39,134
right?

2217
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,120
And there are people who don't like him.

2218
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:41,630
Oh,

2219
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:42,880
I love that guy too,

2220
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,140
because that what we're,

2221
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,100
what we're searching for,

2222
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:49,100
I think is we are trying to
be authentically who we are.

2223
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,510
I think that's all we're doing.

2224
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,860
That's what Nick Diaz is.

2225
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:53,330
Whatever the fuck you think he is.

2226
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:58,510
He is authentically Nick Diaz and w and
the metaphor to me is Paul Daley is a

2227
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:01,400
wall and you can,

2228
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,790
you can dig under it or you can go around
it or you can trick somebody who gives

2229
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,510
you a rope or you can climb
it or you can dissemble it.

2230
01:10:08,511 --> 01:10:08,991
And Nick's like,

2231
01:10:08,991 --> 01:10:09,411
fuck it,

2232
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,400
I'm going to go through it.

2233
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,540
I'm going to go through it.

2234
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,140
And there are many ways to choose to
live your life and that's how Nick Diaz

2235
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:16,010
lifts his fucking life.

2236
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:16,670
And that's,

2237
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,600
that's beautiful.

2238
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,090
What sucks is that he
hasn't fought in forever.

2239
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,430
I mean he hasn't fought since
the Anderson Silva fight.

2240
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:23,264
That's crazy.

2241
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:27,650
It's crazy that they suspended him for
marijuana when Anderson Silva tested

2242
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:31,160
positive for steroids in that fight
and he got a shorter suspension.

2243
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:31,994
The nick,

2244
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,140
that's a reflection.

2245
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:36,110
That's a cultural leftover
cultural reflection.

2246
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:39,860
That's also the nick refuse to pay
the fine cause that's Nick d is being

2247
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:40,990
authentically Nicholas.

2248
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,830
You're not getting that money from me.

2249
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,713
Oh see ya.

2250
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:46,580
But you can admire that.

2251
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:47,414
Like some,

2252
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:49,850
some people will look at
that and go do just pay it.

2253
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:50,431
It'll go this way.

2254
01:10:50,431 --> 01:10:50,721
And he said,

2255
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:51,051
no.

2256
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:52,640
Fundamentally who I am,

2257
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:53,480
I cannot do that.

2258
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,270
I will get negative
consequences in my life,

2259
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:59,060
but I will be authentic to who I am.

2260
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,490
But nick is like 36 now I think.

2261
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:02,440
How old is Nick Diaz?

2262
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:02,840
No,

2263
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,250
34 he's 34 now.

2264
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,310
So yeah.

2265
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:06,020
Well Dude,

2266
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,130
his first fight in UFC,

2267
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:12,131
I believe he was 20 you know when he
fought Jeremy Jackson like way back in the

2268
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:12,141
day,

2269
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:13,980
he was 18 you

2270
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,221
know,

2271
01:11:14,221 --> 01:11:16,950
I mean he's been around man,

2272
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:17,431
you know,

2273
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:21,570
he's been a brown so he's still like
literally in his physical prime.

2274
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:22,500
I mean,

2275
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,840
and this is crazy
considering the fact that,

2276
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:28,230
I want to say the Anderson
Silva fight was three years ago.

2277
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,770
What is the way it feels?

2278
01:11:29,771 --> 01:11:29,980
Yeah,

2279
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,190
somewhere around there.

2280
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,720
I would love to see him
back in there again.

2281
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:34,440
You know?

2282
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,273
I don't know.

2283
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:35,451
No,

2284
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:35,531
no.

2285
01:11:35,531 --> 01:11:36,900
Got To get what you want to do though.

2286
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,460
I don't know if he really,

2287
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,151
truly,

2288
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:40,050
that's what he wants to do.

2289
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:40,430
He'll,

2290
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,370
he'll find a way to do it.

2291
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:42,204
And if he doesn't,

2292
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:42,580
yeah.

2293
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:42,990
You know,

2294
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:43,351
George,

2295
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:44,400
you got George coming in.

2296
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:45,503
I'm,

2297
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:46,710
I asked George,

2298
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,090
so my,

2299
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:48,871
at work,

2300
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:49,231
they're like,

2301
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:49,410
hey,

2302
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:51,360
can you see what's up with
George and this Nate Diaz?

2303
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:51,840
And I'm like,

2304
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,130
well,

2305
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:52,471
ask,

2306
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:53,010
but,

2307
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:55,200
and I'll ask honestly as a friend,

2308
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:58,560
and he knows that I'm also employed
by somebody who I have a little

2309
01:11:58,561 --> 01:11:59,131
conversation,

2310
01:11:59,131 --> 01:11:59,580
but,

2311
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:04,580
but I will never advert sacrifice a
friendship or like a longterm relationship

2312
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:07,430
to like find something out on that.

2313
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:08,303
Yeah.

2314
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,750
I don't care about,

2315
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:14,400
and I don't care about Twitter beefs
and I don't care about the breaking news

2316
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:14,911
and all that.

2317
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:15,744
It's just not interesting.

2318
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,070
It's not anything to do with my life.

2319
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,210
But I'll go ask George.

2320
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:19,440
So I asked George,

2321
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,120
who we are friends,

2322
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,700
we talked yesterday and uh,

2323
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,713
we will,

2324
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,660
he will tell me the truth and then,

2325
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,440
and something as simple as all,

2326
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:30,841
you know,

2327
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:32,190
not as fucking bullshit,

2328
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,810
maybe not in exactly those terms,

2329
01:12:33,811 --> 01:12:34,644
but he would say.

2330
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:35,760
But when I asked him about it,

2331
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:36,420
he's like,

2332
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:36,691
no,

2333
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:37,320
Bro.

2334
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:37,740
Uh,

2335
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,670
I haven't signed nothing.

2336
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,440
And I looked at that and like,

2337
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:41,191
oh my God,

2338
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:42,930
that's George tried to be deceptive.

2339
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,660
Like George would normally
go ass be ass man.

2340
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,494
That's not happening.

2341
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,240
I know I haven't signed anything.

2342
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,600
Well I know they've offered him knee,

2343
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:51,480
but that was George,

2344
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,340
who's Shitty at being deceptive,

2345
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,650
trying to be deceptive like he,

2346
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:55,921
yeah,

2347
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:56,701
so like you said,

2348
01:12:56,701 --> 01:12:57,391
they've offered it to,

2349
01:12:57,391 --> 01:13:00,060
they've offered it to him and by
saying I haven't signed it means he's

2350
01:13:00,061 --> 01:13:00,800
considering it.

2351
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,970
I think he's considering it,

2352
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:06,650
but I think he's also considering could
be number of off and then there's always

2353
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,290
the great Irish Leprechaun,

2354
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:10,850
you know mean.

2355
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:12,800
I think those are the two big fights.

2356
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:14,180
The two big fights or could be,

2357
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,590
but one 55 or even one 70 yeah.

2358
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,960
GSP wants to winner of Conor McGregor
versus could be not Nate Diaz insider

2359
01:13:20,961 --> 01:13:24,680
drops bombshell and this
is May 19th Saturday.

2360
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:25,281
Yeah.

2361
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:26,300
I'm sure he wants that.

2362
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,040
But that fight would
have to take place first.

2363
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:30,150
And who the fuck knows
when Connor or could be,

2364
01:13:30,151 --> 01:13:32,440
but fight afterwards if it's Connor,

2365
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,860
it might be a decade later.

2366
01:13:33,861 --> 01:13:34,071
I mean,

2367
01:13:34,071 --> 01:13:35,930
who the fuck knows what
that guys going to do?

2368
01:13:35,931 --> 01:13:39,080
Now when you give a guy like
Conor a hundred million dollars,

2369
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:39,771
you know,

2370
01:13:39,771 --> 01:13:41,000
I mean this is what happens.

2371
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:45,230
He's throwing dollars at bus windows
and losing his fucking mind and yeah,

2372
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,190
that's mad of Jamie,

2373
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:47,600
that UFC inside of a shop,

2374
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:48,740
was it?

2375
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:48,891
Yeah,

2376
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:49,820
it was on his podcast.

2377
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,070
I didn't saw that.

2378
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:51,903
Scroll down.

2379
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:55,880
UFC inside Brendan shot those who?

2380
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:57,610
Brendan Schaub as you fucking idiots.

2381
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:00,140
That fucking some obscure insider.

2382
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:01,963
Yeah,

2383
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:03,980
well I'm sure he does want that,

2384
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,380
but if they offer him a fat
paycheck and they really should,

2385
01:14:06,381 --> 01:14:07,010
if they want.

2386
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:07,311
Look,

2387
01:14:07,311 --> 01:14:08,780
the UFC is in a weird position.

2388
01:14:08,781 --> 01:14:08,960
They,

2389
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,770
they bought the company for $4.

2390
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,060
I don't know what it's worth,

2391
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,090
but I would guess it's probably
not really worth $4 billion.

2392
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,890
They have a giant monthly nut.

2393
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,240
It's fucking huge.

2394
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:23,650
The monthly nut that they have to make
caused them to fire a hundred employees.

2395
01:14:23,651 --> 01:14:23,801
I mean,

2396
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:26,440
there's a lot going on
and there's been some,

2397
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:26,780
you know,

2398
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:30,220
great fights and it's obviously
still incredibly popular,

2399
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,670
but you want to make those
big paper view bucks.

2400
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,380
You need the big name stars.

2401
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,480
GSP was always a big name.

2402
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:42,481
Star became even bigger when he came back
and beat Bisbing and one by finish and

2403
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,000
you've got them in a rear naked
choke and put them to sleep.

2404
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:48,640
I mean he's still a giant star.

2405
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,380
However he hasn't fought in
a while vacated at title.

2406
01:14:51,381 --> 01:14:52,690
It doesn't have the title anymore.

2407
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,120
So it's not as big of a deal to
the public size when his sit down.

2408
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:57,790
It is,

2409
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:58,151
it is.

2410
01:14:58,151 --> 01:14:59,500
People are dumb as shit man.

2411
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:00,543
Yeah.

2412
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,980
The funny thing to me is like,

2413
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,420
I always feel like,

2414
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,313
and,

2415
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:09,100
and I always feel like a
lot of these mechanisms,

2416
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,000
title shots,

2417
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:10,721
rankings,

2418
01:15:10,721 --> 01:15:11,554
belts,

2419
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:12,040
uh,

2420
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:12,551
you know,

2421
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,384
Twitter beefs.

2422
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:18,390
They weren't intended to be there as
a short term solution to give people a

2423
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:21,220
talking point until they saw how,

2424
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,380
till they got deeply
invested in connected.

2425
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:23,651
Right.

2426
01:15:23,651 --> 01:15:24,580
And I think that was,

2427
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:29,790
but yet somehow these sort of extra
outside distractions became the focus.

2428
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,050
Who the fuck cares?

2429
01:15:32,051 --> 01:15:33,340
Who's the number eight guy?

2430
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:38,320
And who cares if these guys are mad at
each other on Twitter and the belt itself

2431
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:39,910
as a mechanism for discussion.

2432
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,350
What matters is the fight.

2433
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:41,750
And,

2434
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,300
and I know that it's like,

2435
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:43,961
yeah,

2436
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:47,200
but you're obsessed with
fighting most people,

2437
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:50,890
if you show them what's really going on
there and contextualize the fact that

2438
01:15:50,891 --> 01:15:54,310
these two human beings have dedicated
their life and take an all of the

2439
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:57,820
knowledge in human history to put
on the line in this moment of,

2440
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,490
of severe intensity and consequence,

2441
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:04,570
he won't care as much about whether
somebody has an interim title,

2442
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:05,583
you won't know

2443
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:06,960
you won't and you won't.

2444
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:11,700
But the average Joe blow by a paper
view once a year is going to care.

2445
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,133
Maybe.

2446
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:13,640
Well,

2447
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,140
I mean that's the idea behind
stripping Tony Ferguson.

2448
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:16,650
Yeah,

2449
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:17,071
I mean,

2450
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:17,400
why,

2451
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:17,971
why strip?

2452
01:16:17,971 --> 01:16:18,400
I'm why,

2453
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,141
why takeaways?

2454
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:19,801
Interim title,

2455
01:16:19,801 --> 01:16:20,940
let them keep the interim title.

2456
01:16:20,941 --> 01:16:21,960
If you want to strip Connor,

2457
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,180
just strip Connor,

2458
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,031
that's trip Connor.

2459
01:16:24,031 --> 01:16:26,220
And then Tony's obviously
going to go through surgery.

2460
01:16:26,221 --> 01:16:27,270
Tony didn't do anything wrong.

2461
01:16:27,271 --> 01:16:28,260
He fell and hurt himself.

2462
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:33,110
But I think at the root of it is the
filicides is an incorrect philosophical

2463
01:16:33,111 --> 01:16:33,560
belief.

2464
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,393
So when I,

2465
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:38,330
if I talked to people at the UFC
and I talked to them periodically,

2466
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,453
um,

2467
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:42,620
and I'll discuss
something with them about,

2468
01:16:42,621 --> 01:16:43,130
you know,

2469
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:45,050
and it's generally at
different times been like,

2470
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:45,830
hey man,

2471
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:48,590
you can see the work that I'm doing
and you can see people like it,

2472
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:52,910
could I contribute something
x or y and then I'll mention,

2473
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,810
you know,

2474
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,040
they will then say,

2475
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:55,341
well,

2476
01:16:55,341 --> 01:16:56,030
you know,

2477
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:59,180
you've got like a really
unique way of approaching it.

2478
01:16:59,181 --> 01:16:59,620
We think,

2479
01:16:59,620 --> 01:16:59,830
you know,

2480
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:02,120
we got so many casual fans watching on,

2481
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:05,260
on Fox or on these TV stations.

2482
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:07,070
It's just such a casual audience.

2483
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,290
And I think about it,

2484
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,710
it's like nobody questions at the,

2485
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:15,590
the percentage of people that are a casual
fan that is watching anything is very

2486
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:16,550
close to zero.

2487
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,290
Very close to zero.

2488
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:19,070
Yeah.

2489
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,270
Because the casual,

2490
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:20,761
the,

2491
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:25,761
the not actively choosing what to watch
is being on a Netflix search or is

2492
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:30,350
somebody puts something on and I go in
and see what the rock is cooking in his

2493
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:31,184
kitchen,

2494
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:31,461
you know,

2495
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:31,780
or I said,

2496
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,950
what's your dog's name
and the Gold Dog Marshall.

2497
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:36,170
I go and see what fucking
Joe is feeding Marshall.

2498
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:40,820
Nobody's watching something they're
not interested in ever in our society,

2499
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,190
we are all conscious,

2500
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:42,830
uh,

2501
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:47,660
constantly and consciously choosing
what we consume at all times.

2502
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:48,500
And if we're sitting there,

2503
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:51,440
whether our boyfriend or girlfriend or
husband or wife and they're watching it

2504
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:52,820
were somewhere else,

2505
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:57,970
by feeding this nonexistent casual
audience and really believing they exist

2506
01:17:58,071 --> 01:18:00,560
despite all the evidence
that there was no such thing,

2507
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,660
you are now giving less,

2508
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:03,470
uh,

2509
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,760
importance to the,

2510
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:07,370
your actual audience who
is ready to go deeper,

2511
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:09,140
ready to see something more meaningful,

2512
01:18:09,141 --> 01:18:10,790
ready to be brought somewhere different.

2513
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:15,020
There is no casual audience of
almost anything in our modern world.

2514
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,450
I like what you're saying,

2515
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,080
but I disagree because people are
watching and they don't know what the fuck

2516
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:21,680
they're watching.

2517
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,790
I've done it with people.

2518
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:23,130
I've,

2519
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:27,710
I've unfortunately watch fights over
friends houses before cause I happened to

2520
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:28,820
be there and then,

2521
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:29,061
you know,

2522
01:18:29,061 --> 01:18:30,470
there'll be people
sitting around watching a,

2523
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:31,610
why doesn't he just do this?

2524
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:33,260
But they still chose to watch it.

2525
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:35,360
They still may not pay attention,

2526
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:36,470
but they made that choice.

2527
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,320
Let's say they're barely paying attention,

2528
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,720
they don't know what the
fuck they're watching.

2529
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:44,180
So a guy like you comes in talking
about artistry and all this and they,

2530
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,060
I think you are great.

2531
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,260
I love your approach,

2532
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:53,261
but I think your approach in their eyes
is a little bit too esoteric and complex

2533
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,420
and maybe it'd be balanced out
better with someone like me.

2534
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:57,650
Yeah.

2535
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,100
Yes.

2536
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:58,933
But you know what I mean?

2537
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:02,840
100% and as a result we're not over,

2538
01:19:02,841 --> 01:19:05,720
especially the last sort of year
or so I've looked at it like,

2539
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:06,740
you know,

2540
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:09,260
trying to force something like I'm not,

2541
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,910
I'm not sort of happily
saying that I would be,

2542
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,880
I would be in a relationship
with you and accept what you are.

2543
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:21,530
I'm saying I think we should be in a
relationship only I want to change you and

2544
01:19:21,531 --> 01:19:22,364
that's not right.

2545
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:22,831
Yes.

2546
01:19:22,831 --> 01:19:23,240
I'm like,

2547
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,560
I'm literally saying,

2548
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,750
I'm not saying put a role here.

2549
01:19:26,751 --> 01:19:28,940
Tell me what that role
you need and I'll do it.

2550
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:32,990
I'm actually saying I think it should
be different and that's why it's not a

2551
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:33,411
good fit.

2552
01:19:33,411 --> 01:19:37,880
And that's why I say a one championship
is a more logical fit for me because

2553
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:40,250
it's younger and it's in its evolution,

2554
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,650
but still growing

2555
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,880
think I agree with you,

2556
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:47,060
but I think it goes back to the money
cause I think there's so much money

2557
01:19:47,061 --> 01:19:50,000
involved in the UFC that they
have to make money every month.

2558
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:50,391
I mean it's,

2559
01:19:50,391 --> 01:19:50,800
it's there,

2560
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,820
it's there in a tricky situation.

2561
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,893
It's like,

2562
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:58,940
like if you're a guy and you make 500
bucks a week and you really like this car,

2563
01:19:58,941 --> 01:20:00,410
God damn that corvette is so nice.

2564
01:20:00,411 --> 01:20:00,951
I really like it.

2565
01:20:00,951 --> 01:20:01,041
Well,

2566
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:01,861
how much is the lease?

2567
01:20:01,861 --> 01:20:03,830
The lease is $1,000 a month,

2568
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:05,270
but you only make $2,000 a month.

2569
01:20:05,271 --> 01:20:08,040
How are you going to do that while if
I only pay 500 bucks a month in rent,

2570
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,720
I can kind of pull it off.

2571
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:10,390
Right?

2572
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:10,951
Like he,

2573
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:12,450
I guess he can,

2574
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,410
but you got to watch every penny and you
gotta be cautious and I think you could

2575
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:20,220
put yourself in these traps and then
you have to like really micromanage

2576
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:20,910
everything you do.

2577
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,470
Like we've got to make money
but we got to make money,

2578
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:27,590
but we got to make money instead of we
got to do what we like and put together

2579
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:32,520
what we like and do the best
possible version of what we like.

2580
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:35,790
Like a perfect example
is like this podcast.

2581
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,650
I don't have a boss.

2582
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,940
There's no overhead.

2583
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,833
I don't have,

2584
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:41,520
I mean I have a couple employees.

2585
01:20:41,521 --> 01:20:42,540
It's very easy.

2586
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,740
There's no worries,

2587
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:48,890
so I don't give a fuck if I have you on
to talk about stuff or a leap expert or

2588
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,580
I'm not going to have anybody on that.

2589
01:20:51,581 --> 01:20:51,841
I don't,

2590
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:54,120
I'm not interested in talking to because,

2591
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:56,070
and I'll talk about
whatever the fuck I want to.

2592
01:20:56,071 --> 01:20:56,610
I don't,

2593
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:57,101
I don't think,

2594
01:20:57,101 --> 01:20:57,311
God,

2595
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:57,780
I know.

2596
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,550
I don't know if people are
going to be interested in this.

2597
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:01,050
I need that advertising money.

2598
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:02,750
I need to say if you,

2599
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:04,230
because of that.

2600
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,020
I think it's one of the reasons why
the show has been successful because it

2601
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:09,660
honestly represents my thinking.

2602
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:14,870
It's like I am allowed to pursue my
interests and have these conversations and

2603
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,260
let it be pure.

2604
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,110
I think if the UFC took
that exact approach,

2605
01:21:19,111 --> 01:21:20,700
I think the product would be better.

2606
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:25,910
And I think if they had someone like you
breaking down the artistry of specific

2607
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:26,784
techniques,

2608
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,880
the air quote casual fan would be more
educated and they would learn more about

2609
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:32,731
it.

2610
01:21:32,731 --> 01:21:33,001
I mean,

2611
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:37,290
and you get some of that from Dominick
Cruz when he does his breakdowns on Fox

2612
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,330
and some of the other
fighters who do breakdowns.

2613
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:40,020
And um,

2614
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,660
when Daniel Cormier AA
does wrestling breakdowns,

2615
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,470
breakdowns,

2616
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:47,850
specific techniques of why they work and
why they don't work and what someone's

2617
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:48,061
doing,

2618
01:21:48,061 --> 01:21:48,894
right or wrong,

2619
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,190
you get educated,

2620
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:50,611
you know,

2621
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:53,440
and I tried to do the best I can to when
it comes to the ground in particular,

2622
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:57,270
which is what I think is
the most confusing aspect
of MMA for the casual fan.

2623
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:58,200
But,

2624
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:58,890
um,

2625
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:03,480
I think we should approach
the f the entire sport in the,

2626
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:03,750
the,

2627
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,960
the most illuminating way possible.

2628
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:10,260
And I think a guy like you and
your approach is very valuable.

2629
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:11,790
And I love your breakdowns.

2630
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:12,331
Thanks man.

2631
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:13,161
I'm a big fan of him.

2632
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,820
It's why retweet him all the time.

2633
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:19,821
I just think that you have a a very
unique and passionate and it not just

2634
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,950
passionate approach but it's genuine.

2635
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:24,150
Like I know you,

2636
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:28,260
I've talked to you when the cameras are
not on and you are just as interested in

2637
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:28,860
this.

2638
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:29,693
I really am.

2639
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,070
And I think we're just going through,

2640
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,120
thank you by the way man.

2641
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:36,510
I think where we're going
through whatever you're doing,

2642
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:40,200
if you're trying to seek some kind of
mastery and if you realize you're really

2643
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,010
early in it,

2644
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:42,840
you can do it by studying yoga.

2645
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:43,501
Some people do,

2646
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:44,221
some people do it.

2647
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:44,471
They,

2648
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:45,120
they're in,

2649
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,310
they go to church twice a week.

2650
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,260
You're just looking to try to grow.

2651
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,460
And if you do it with
something that you're deeply
fascinated and eventually you

2652
01:22:53,461 --> 01:22:55,890
kind of learn about
connections and all things,

2653
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:56,161
you know,

2654
01:22:56,161 --> 01:23:00,360
it's the study of martial arts or the
study of Yoga or the study of jazz or

2655
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,090
whatever teaches you about
connections in all things.

2656
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,590
And my life is so fucking good.

2657
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:05,960
And,

2658
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,390
and these little moments where I'm like,

2659
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,620
I don't know why these guys,

2660
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:09,483
I don't work for them.

2661
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,960
That doesn't make any sense.

2662
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:14,710
It doesn't make any sense for me to think
that because I get up in the morning

2663
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:15,641
and I sit in my car,

2664
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:19,900
I make my wife and I coffee and I sit
in my kitchen and I fucking analyze

2665
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:20,710
fighting.

2666
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:24,940
I sit down and I look at it and I look
for moments and I look for things.

2667
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:26,890
I think people will find fascinating.

2668
01:23:26,891 --> 01:23:30,370
I look for things that'll
teach us something about
life and I look for these and

2669
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:31,204
I'm make them.

2670
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:31,931
Then when I make them,

2671
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:36,280
people seem to like them and then that
gets me jobs commentating where I fly off

2672
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:36,790
and I get to,

2673
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:41,790
I mean I got it so fucking gun to
try to square peg my way into a large

2674
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:46,390
corporation because years back
I dreamed about working there.

2675
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,370
Sometimes you change your dream,

2676
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,420
sometimes it's okay to change your
route and find the world changes.

2677
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:53,254
Constantly

2678
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,170
be afraid to be flexible and you know the,

2679
01:23:56,180 --> 01:24:00,990
the idea of holding onto a dream for
your entire life despite your interest is

2680
01:24:00,991 --> 01:24:02,010
pretty ridiculous.

2681
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:02,430
Yeah.

2682
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,720
I mean there's things that I
wanted to do when I was younger.

2683
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:05,780
I don't want to do anymore.

2684
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:06,420
It doesn't,

2685
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:06,721
you know,

2686
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:08,970
you should follow your interest period.

2687
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:09,410
Yeah.

2688
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:09,590
Yeah.

2689
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:12,720
And if they change your
change as you change and grow.

2690
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:14,070
I mean these,

2691
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:18,540
like I talked about my waning love for
talk one doe when I realized that it

2692
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:20,250
wasn't really the right way to go.

2693
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,810
Well when I first started doing it,

2694
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:23,490
I thought it was the most
effective martial art.

2695
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:24,900
Once I realized it wasn't,

2696
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,430
I lost interest,

2697
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,380
I lost interest in competing in it.

2698
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:28,801
I just,

2699
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:30,960
it didn't seem like the
thing to do anymore.

2700
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:34,650
And I think that as you
grow as a human being,

2701
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,250
you're in,

2702
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,380
you should have other interests.

2703
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,101
I mean,

2704
01:24:38,101 --> 01:24:42,300
and I think the ones that are the most
intriguing in the most passionate,

2705
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:43,070
uh,

2706
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:43,400
are you the,

2707
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:43,741
you're the,

2708
01:24:43,741 --> 01:24:45,690
you're the most passionate of theirs.

2709
01:24:45,691 --> 01:24:48,930
They're going to give you the
most reward if you pursue them.

2710
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,940
If you're more passionate about music,

2711
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,620
then you are about accounting.

2712
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:56,190
But you decided to stick with accounting
because it's what's paying your bills

2713
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:56,760
and like,

2714
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,001
man,

2715
01:24:57,001 --> 01:24:57,900
that's a dark road.

2716
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,730
That's a soul suck and road.

2717
01:24:59,731 --> 01:25:00,071
You're going to go,

2718
01:25:00,071 --> 01:25:00,150
yeah,

2719
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:00,710
down.

2720
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:01,080
Sit,

2721
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:06,080
it feels scary in for somebody in that
setting to change because in the short

2722
01:25:06,511 --> 01:25:07,530
run it will be painful.

2723
01:25:07,531 --> 01:25:10,960
But in the long run it will be
so valuable and less painful.

2724
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:11,600
Yeah.

2725
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,120
Yeah.

2726
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:12,630
Listen,

2727
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:17,520
20 years have way less pain is such
a great trade for two years of pain.

2728
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:20,980
But if you're that guy with that corvette
that you got that lease on and you

2729
01:25:20,981 --> 01:25:22,810
could barely fucking make those payments,

2730
01:25:22,811 --> 01:25:25,420
you can not take any chances.

2731
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:27,490
You have to just work those extra hours.

2732
01:25:27,491 --> 01:25:27,611
Well,

2733
01:25:27,611 --> 01:25:30,190
if I just put in two hours
of overtime every day,

2734
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:32,050
that's still only 10 hours of work a day.

2735
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,600
But that was two hours at 20
bucks an hour and a little out.

2736
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,130
We started doing those calculations.

2737
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:36,760
And that's how you,

2738
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:37,750
that's how you get fucked.

2739
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,340
And that's how you get trapped.

2740
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:40,210
And next thing you know,

2741
01:25:40,211 --> 01:25:43,550
you've got a family and you've got kids
and you definitely can't move and you

2742
01:25:43,551 --> 01:25:46,210
got a mortgage and you definitely
ain't pursuing any music dreams.

2743
01:25:46,211 --> 01:25:46,430
Now,

2744
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:47,050
motherfucker,

2745
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:47,530
that's true.

2746
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:48,221
And this is,

2747
01:25:48,221 --> 01:25:49,840
this is the trap that life leads.

2748
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:50,730
Yeah.

2749
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:51,031
You know,

2750
01:25:51,031 --> 01:25:51,690
um,

2751
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:52,590
I watched,

2752
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:54,090
so I do a one man show now.

2753
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:55,500
So I built where the friend,

2754
01:25:55,501 --> 01:25:56,880
I built a one man show.

2755
01:25:56,881 --> 01:25:57,320
It's like,

2756
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:57,401
oh,

2757
01:25:57,401 --> 01:25:58,560
we're going to theater setting,

2758
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:58,771
right?

2759
01:25:58,771 --> 01:25:59,190
Yeah.

2760
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:00,450
Like how do you do that?

2761
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:01,350
Do you use video?

2762
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:03,090
How it is for,

2763
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:05,460
we put it for um,

2764
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,590
drunk tedtalks right.

2765
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:12,600
So it's four story driven
parts of life that uh,

2766
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:16,340
take you on a bit of an
in theory and in practice.

2767
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:18,860
So far people seem to
be inspired or find it,

2768
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:19,491
you know,

2769
01:26:19,491 --> 01:26:20,121
compelling.

2770
01:26:20,121 --> 01:26:21,860
And people have cried Adam them before,

2771
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:22,940
which is really quite moving.

2772
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:24,620
But I go to a dog gate,

2773
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,570
they may be shit especially.

2774
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:26,900
Yeah.

2775
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:27,650
Um,

2776
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:28,483
but uh,

2777
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:28,850
I,

2778
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,110
I did it with,

2779
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:32,180
so I decided I wanted to do that.

2780
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:36,150
I decided I want to get up and
tell stories and hopefully a fun,

2781
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,320
entertain people or find them,

2782
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,730
inspire them or take them somewhere.

2783
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:42,740
And I did it.

2784
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:46,650
Partly I watched your show and then that
would have never in a million years.

2785
01:26:46,651 --> 01:26:49,310
So when I saw you in Vegas would never
in a million years thought I could do

2786
01:26:49,311 --> 01:26:53,750
that because it's clearly a lifetime of
training and development and improvement

2787
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:57,080
and trial and error and thousands
and thousands of repetitions.

2788
01:26:57,081 --> 01:27:01,700
And you look at that and you don't look
at an Olympic gymnast and say I can do

2789
01:27:01,701 --> 01:27:01,941
that.

2790
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:02,591
And that's kind of,

2791
01:27:02,591 --> 01:27:03,740
so I didn't think of it at all.

2792
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:08,780
But then I saw Brendan do his show and
it was awesome and I realized he only

2793
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:10,190
started working on this two years ago.

2794
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,030
You know what I mean?

2795
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:13,310
And all he represents is hard,

2796
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,210
hard work,

2797
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,000
sacrifice and drive to learn.

2798
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,740
And that's possible.

2799
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:18,981
Yeah.

2800
01:27:18,981 --> 01:27:23,900
Which shop is doing is what I said to
him as you are essentially using an

2801
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:27,290
athlete's work ethic and
applying it to an art form.

2802
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,870
And that's what's awesome about him.

2803
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,880
He's a funny guy who realize like,

2804
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:33,050
I can do standup,

2805
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,450
I just need to put the
time in and you know,

2806
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:36,530
I've seen that guy kill,

2807
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,491
I mean kill.

2808
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:39,220
And he's been doing
comedy for like two years,

2809
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,090
you know,

2810
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:40,390
that

2811
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:41,223
is inspiring.

2812
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:42,290
That should in,

2813
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,410
you should be aware when you see that,

2814
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:47,920
that that means something you work on
for only a couple of years as possible,

2815
01:27:47,921 --> 01:27:49,360
if you're driven and smart and,

2816
01:27:49,361 --> 01:27:50,500
and really committed.

2817
01:27:50,501 --> 01:27:51,670
And that's what I took out of his shell.

2818
01:27:51,671 --> 01:27:53,200
Plus he explained to me the process.

2819
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:55,150
So I decided I'm doing it right.

2820
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:58,960
So I booked about five months ahead
in Winnipeg because there was a UFC in

2821
01:27:58,961 --> 01:28:01,390
Winnipeg and that's my
hometown to do a small theater.

2822
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:01,931
And I'm like,

2823
01:28:01,931 --> 01:28:02,171
okay,

2824
01:28:02,171 --> 01:28:03,004
five months.

2825
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:03,521
And I'm like,

2826
01:28:03,521 --> 01:28:04,720
what the fuck do I do?

2827
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:06,930
So I called up a good friend of mine gray.

2828
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:07,480
I'm just you,

2829
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,111
when you booked it,

2830
01:28:08,111 --> 01:28:09,250
you didn't have to have a show.

2831
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:10,923
I didn't have the shell.

2832
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,640
Maybe months yourself.

2833
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:13,270
Yeah.

2834
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:13,721
So,

2835
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:14,480
and I cut,

2836
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,450
but I had one plan that
was going to call up.

2837
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:19,510
My friend Graham is the door
who is a playwright and um,

2838
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:22,270
and a writer for vice and a
bunch of other stuff and uh,

2839
01:28:22,271 --> 01:28:24,790
and very smart and interesting
and we're good friends,

2840
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,320
but we have very different perspectives.

2841
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:26,950
And I said,

2842
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:27,671
I booked this show.

2843
01:28:27,671 --> 01:28:28,570
It's in six months.

2844
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:29,920
I need 40 minutes.

2845
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:30,790
It's gotta be eye.

2846
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:31,450
And he's,

2847
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:36,010
he has told some of my stories and vice
before getting drunk with sumo wrestlers

2848
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:36,821
and different,

2849
01:28:36,821 --> 01:28:37,571
different stories.

2850
01:28:37,571 --> 01:28:37,981
And so he's,

2851
01:28:37,981 --> 01:28:38,814
how much do you weigh?

2852
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:42,790
A one 56 and you got
drunk with sumo wrestler?

2853
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:43,120
Scary.

2854
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,371
Oh,

2855
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:44,140
scary.

2856
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,160
It was really like,

2857
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,960
it was joyous.

2858
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:47,711
Like it was,

2859
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:50,950
you've never seen anything
like this became big though.

2860
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:51,370
Yeah.

2861
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:51,581
Oh,

2862
01:28:51,581 --> 01:28:52,211
you should see it.

2863
01:28:52,211 --> 01:28:54,240
So Byamba do you know who'd be is?

2864
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:54,821
He's like,

2865
01:28:54,821 --> 01:28:55,061
okay.

2866
01:28:55,061 --> 01:28:58,090
So if you ever see us
Sumal on TV that's beyond.

2867
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:03,240
So he's the guy like in the Geico
commercial do I being a figure skater,

2868
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:04,890
tiger woods of sumo wrestling.

2869
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:06,210
And he is a genius.

2870
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:07,021
He's a world champion,

2871
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:09,000
but he's also an entertainer.

2872
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,070
So he lives in Hollywood and he's very,

2873
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:12,210
very blips here.

2874
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:12,750
Yeah,

2875
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:13,020
yeah.

2876
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,680
He is sumo Russell's,

2877
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:14,871
yeah,

2878
01:29:14,871 --> 01:29:15,704
there he is.

2879
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,490
Yeah,

2880
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:18,090
he is from Mongolia.

2881
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:22,950
But he spends a great deal of time here
working as a television personality and

2882
01:29:22,951 --> 01:29:24,450
an actor and whatever.

2883
01:29:24,451 --> 01:29:26,070
But he's still just look fat.

2884
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:26,491
Oh,

2885
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:27,750
he's got it looks jacked.

2886
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:29,820
Like go to that one where
he's doing that muscle pose.

2887
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,030
Don't worry there.

2888
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,280
Yeah.

2889
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:31,520
Yeah.

2890
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,680
See that's like those shoulder
muscles through all that fat.

2891
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,970
That guy looks like a tank.

2892
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,211
Well,

2893
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:37,050
people don't realize,

2894
01:29:37,051 --> 01:29:41,550
but underneath there is like you or
underneath there is like Tj Dillashaw.

2895
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:42,151
You know what I mean?

2896
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:46,770
There is muscular person underneath
all those additional layers of fat and

2897
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:47,720
fleshing skin.

2898
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:48,320
There was a,

2899
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,620
there was a powerful athlete,

2900
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:52,200
a real benefit and being not fat.

2901
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:53,340
Uh,

2902
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:53,581
yeah.

2903
01:29:53,581 --> 01:29:56,400
Force power generation like momentum,

2904
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:57,120
the ability,

2905
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:57,660
I mean,

2906
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:02,190
if the other guy is that big and our goal
is just to smash into each other until

2907
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:03,780
one of us has taken from the platform,

2908
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:04,050
right.

2909
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:05,040
You're not that big,

2910
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,600
it's going to be very difficult.

2911
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,110
Right.

2912
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:11,670
So it's like an arms race of size over
generations where they just got bigger

2913
01:30:11,671 --> 01:30:12,810
and bigger out of necessity.

2914
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:13,830
Because if you're bigger,

2915
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,401
I mean,

2916
01:30:14,401 --> 01:30:15,234
what am I going to do?

2917
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:16,383
Uh,

2918
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,660
we could in theory,

2919
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:20,910
maybe I could use your size against your,

2920
01:30:20,911 --> 01:30:25,830
I could use technique and strategy
and smarts to take you off,

2921
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:28,130
but I could be big and also to that,

2922
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:28,710
right,

2923
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:28,920
right.

2924
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,630
So why not v also big.

2925
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:31,130
So it,

2926
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:34,440
it arms raised to that point
and there are little guys,

2927
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:35,783
but uh,

2928
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,770
but to watch this guy that's with them,

2929
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:38,890
then he got killed.

2930
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:40,230
He was an impractical jokers.

2931
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:42,331
But yeah,

2932
01:30:42,331 --> 01:30:46,200
beyond that is like he's the most famous
sumo guy in the world and I got wasted

2933
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:49,080
with him at the world combat
games and Saint Petersburg,

2934
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:49,890
Russia.

2935
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:51,390
So I got to commentate it.

2936
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:51,871
Right.

2937
01:30:51,871 --> 01:30:55,980
So I was in Saint Petersburg
and I absolutely love,

2938
01:30:55,981 --> 01:31:00,420
I've found a niche where I
get to commentate like real
traditional martial arts,

2939
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:03,930
a fair bit of done taekwondo
and karate at the Pan Am Games.

2940
01:31:03,931 --> 01:31:07,530
And I did the world so much
championships or the world combat games.

2941
01:31:07,531 --> 01:31:09,210
I do the World Woo Shu Championships,

2942
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:11,070
which is Kung Fu and Sanda.

2943
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:15,660
And so I've carved out this niche where
I get called for these and develop

2944
01:31:15,661 --> 01:31:18,600
expertise in these different
areas and get to experience them.

2945
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:21,330
And see the little details that
change when you change something.

2946
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:25,980
And so I got to commentate sumo and
then after he seemed to like me and he's

2947
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:26,370
kind of like,

2948
01:31:26,370 --> 01:31:31,340
you were drink and it
was something that like,

2949
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:36,390
it's he drink vodka while
you were in Russia to Russia.

2950
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:37,620
So I love Russia.

2951
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:38,600
I do.

2952
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,433
I really do.

2953
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:40,620
I love the Russians.

2954
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:44,520
I love that our view of
combat and of artists,

2955
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:46,230
martial arts and and stuff,

2956
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:48,000
they're very straight.

2957
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:48,510
Like,

2958
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:48,781
you know,

2959
01:31:48,781 --> 01:31:52,140
when you negotiate to commentate or
to do some work that just straight,

2960
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,580
this is what we can pay you.

2961
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,200
This is what we expect of you.

2962
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,191
If you do that,

2963
01:31:56,191 --> 01:31:57,090
we're all going to be happy.

2964
01:31:57,091 --> 01:31:57,924
Like it's very,

2965
01:31:58,270 --> 01:31:59,410
very little bullshit.

2966
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:00,010
Uh,

2967
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,720
Frank Mir does commentary
for them over there,

2968
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:01,871
right?

2969
01:32:01,871 --> 01:32:02,051
Yes,

2970
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:02,710
he does.

2971
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:03,400
Yeah.

2972
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,270
He's very good.

2973
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,133
Frank Mir,

2974
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,690
I would hope that someone
would hire him in America.

2975
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:11,970
They can't afford them because I wasn't
getting paid way too well in Russia.

2976
01:32:11,971 --> 01:32:12,480
In Russia.

2977
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:12,811
Really?

2978
01:32:12,811 --> 01:32:13,500
No kidding.

2979
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:13,740
Yeah.

2980
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,280
For him.

2981
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,810
He said that's why he couldn't
do a deal with [inaudible]

2982
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,770
and his deal with ACB,

2983
01:32:19,771 --> 01:32:20,980
who he loves and respects things,

2984
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:23,190
become sort of partners in there with uh,

2985
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:23,770
with,

2986
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:23,940
uh,

2987
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,470
Mr [inaudible] who runs it,

2988
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,580
where frank is now a part partner
of the presentation of it.

2989
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:31,080
Went for American shows.

2990
01:32:31,081 --> 01:32:31,770
He'll be part,

2991
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:33,360
he'll be part promoter.

2992
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,600
And I think Frank May even get
away from some of the commentary.

2993
01:32:36,601 --> 01:32:38,130
As much as he's good at it and loves it.

2994
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:41,220
I think he's interested in some
of the other aspects of it now,

2995
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:42,360
you know.

2996
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:42,870
Um,

2997
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:43,530
but uh,

2998
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:43,711
yeah,

2999
01:32:43,711 --> 01:32:45,240
they pay very well.

3000
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:47,190
They and they pay the athletes very,

3001
01:32:47,191 --> 01:32:47,790
very well.

3002
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:51,860
You can be a guy that had a couple of
UFC fights or a belt or a fighter too.

3003
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:56,130
They'll give you 60,000 us cash in your
hand in an envelope at the end of it.

3004
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:57,230
Yeah.

3005
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:57,980
That's great.

3006
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:58,221
Well,

3007
01:32:58,221 --> 01:33:00,230
it's always great that
fighters have more options,

3008
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:00,891
you know.

3009
01:33:00,891 --> 01:33:01,400
And uh,

3010
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,850
I know Bella tour has become a
viable option to a lot of fighters.

3011
01:33:04,851 --> 01:33:05,151
You know,

3012
01:33:05,151 --> 01:33:08,360
like guys like Ryan Bader or
making good money over there now.

3013
01:33:08,361 --> 01:33:08,840
And,

3014
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:09,440
and you know,

3015
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,930
Roy McDonald obviously
who's the champion now.

3016
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:13,101
I just think,

3017
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:13,640
uh,

3018
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,570
we need more of those.

3019
01:33:14,571 --> 01:33:15,170
You know,

3020
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:15,920
I,

3021
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,380
I know that Oscar de la Hoya
is getting into the mix now,

3022
01:33:18,381 --> 01:33:20,930
but just the approach that he's making,

3023
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,240
it seems to me to be ridiculous.

3024
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:25,160
The old school promote us approach,

3025
01:33:25,161 --> 01:33:29,690
get some big name and then invest
all your time in that big fight.

3026
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,031
But it's,

3027
01:33:30,031 --> 01:33:30,380
yeah,

3028
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,990
that's the same thing you were
just talking about the UFC,

3029
01:33:32,991 --> 01:33:35,840
the challenge they face now is
that we need another big one.

3030
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:36,770
We need another big one.

3031
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,140
It just seems like that

3032
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,011
that approach.

3033
01:33:40,011 --> 01:33:40,820
Like we just,

3034
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,301
we know,

3035
01:33:41,301 --> 01:33:41,631
okay,

3036
01:33:41,631 --> 01:33:42,970
if this wasn't the upper,

3037
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:44,390
would this be the ideal approach?

3038
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:45,210
No,

3039
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:46,220
it's never the ideal approach.

3040
01:33:46,221 --> 01:33:48,380
The ideal approach is to do
the best fights possible.

3041
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:53,710
The ideal approach is not necessarily to
make the most money or to have the like

3042
01:33:54,951 --> 01:33:56,330
the most spectacular thing.

3043
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,830
Like,

3044
01:33:56,830 --> 01:34:01,380
like when they were really promoting
Ronda Rousey and the rematch with a,

3045
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,400
or the fight with Amanda Nunez
and didn't promote Nunez at all.

3046
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,413
I was,

3047
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,320
I,

3048
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:06,651
you know,

3049
01:34:06,651 --> 01:34:06,981
I was like,

3050
01:34:06,981 --> 01:34:08,990
this is my huge Ronda Rousey fan.

3051
01:34:08,991 --> 01:34:09,824
Everybody knows that.

3052
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:10,361
Um,

3053
01:34:10,361 --> 01:34:11,270
I think she's a,

3054
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:12,440
she's a legend.

3055
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:12,651
I mean,

3056
01:34:12,651 --> 01:34:14,270
what she did for women's MMA,

3057
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:19,500
she essentially was the reason why the
UFC decided to have women's MMA was one

3058
01:34:19,941 --> 01:34:20,390
woman.

3059
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:21,860
Everyone's running around and fighting.

3060
01:34:21,861 --> 01:34:22,131
Now.

3061
01:34:22,131 --> 01:34:22,964
I was here that day.

3062
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:23,280
It

3063
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,980
just passed her by and
it happened so quick,

3064
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,760
you know.

3065
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,190
But Amanda Nunez,

3066
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,100
I was thinking even
before Holly Holm Beater,

3067
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:33,750
Amanda Nunez was the big threat.

3068
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,271
I'm like,

3069
01:34:34,271 --> 01:34:37,320
that girl could knock you
fucking dead with one punch.

3070
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:41,700
She is such a ruthless striker and
she's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt.

3071
01:34:41,701 --> 01:34:41,941
I'm like,

3072
01:34:41,941 --> 01:34:44,070
this is a terrible matchup for Rhonda.

3073
01:34:44,071 --> 01:34:44,904
I thought,

3074
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,200
cause Ron does hands,

3075
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,430
although good,

3076
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:47,941
you know,

3077
01:34:47,941 --> 01:34:49,260
and getting better and you know,

3078
01:34:49,261 --> 01:34:52,050
really was starting to look
like a polished striker.

3079
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:57,690
Still doesn't have nearly the kind of
power that Nunez has and the ability that

3080
01:34:58,141 --> 01:34:59,930
I could Nunez Nunez is,

3081
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:02,300
she can take it as well as receive it.

3082
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:06,680
We just seen Rhonda sort of have these
blitz moments with like Batchko Hey,

3083
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:07,011
uh,

3084
01:35:07,011 --> 01:35:07,530
and you know,

3085
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:11,000
and kind of Sarah Mann
bricks just smashed through.

3086
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:15,860
But when you see the overall
game like versus Holly Home,

3087
01:35:15,861 --> 01:35:16,850
then you've got to see all this.

3088
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:20,030
There's a lot of limitations here and
trying to smash through the bricks if the

3089
01:35:20,031 --> 01:35:22,210
bricks aren't there and
the bricks head kick you,

3090
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:22,971
you know what I mean?

3091
01:35:22,971 --> 01:35:23,240
There's,

3092
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,500
there's a lot going on there.

3093
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:24,851
So we're,

3094
01:35:24,851 --> 01:35:27,570
we're seeing the layers
upon layers upon layer.

3095
01:35:27,571 --> 01:35:29,900
So what happens after you
get to the first layer?

3096
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,550
Oh well you don't have a second layer.

3097
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:32,331
You're your,

3098
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:33,121
this is your layer,

3099
01:35:33,121 --> 01:35:34,370
your layer straight forward,

3100
01:35:34,371 --> 01:35:35,204
move ahead.

3101
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,440
And you know,

3102
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:37,670
coaching is to blame as well.

3103
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:37,941
There's a,

3104
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:39,440
there's a lot of things there,

3105
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:42,740
but the fact that they weren't
even promoting Amanda Nunez,

3106
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,600
you have the very first ever openly
gay women's MMA champion in the UFC

3107
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,900
era comes out and is interesting aspect

3108
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,300
and she's a fun girl.

3109
01:35:51,301 --> 01:35:52,170
She's interesting,

3110
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:52,861
you know,

3111
01:35:52,861 --> 01:35:55,340
and she's a fucking killer man.

3112
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:56,640
She's a fucking killer.

3113
01:35:56,641 --> 01:35:57,900
And that you showed it in that fight.

3114
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:00,060
They had an opportunity
to make another star.

3115
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:01,013
Instead,

3116
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,940
they didn't make this other star.

3117
01:36:02,941 --> 01:36:04,980
And then you look at her
most recent paper view,

3118
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:06,690
I heard the numbers were abysmal.

3119
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,560
Vallely I heard,

3120
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:10,920
see if you can find out what the
numbers were because someone told me,

3121
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:11,780
I think it was shopped,

3122
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,910
told me there were 85,000
people view by wow.

3123
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:15,971
Which is scary.

3124
01:36:15,971 --> 01:36:20,971
You should be at this point you have
to stop and wonder is there anything we

3125
01:36:21,131 --> 01:36:23,050
could do strategically different?

3126
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:27,170
Like just because something worked all
the way along in any business or in

3127
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:28,240
anything you're doing,

3128
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:32,740
there might be a time to take a slightly
different approach or to change one of

3129
01:36:32,741 --> 01:36:35,440
the fundamental beliefs of how
we do business or something.

3130
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:36,573
You know what I mean?

3131
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:37,780
What you can't do is just go,

3132
01:36:37,781 --> 01:36:37,931
well,

3133
01:36:37,931 --> 01:36:39,160
hopefully the next one will be good.

3134
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:39,431
I mean,

3135
01:36:39,431 --> 01:36:44,250
you watch that happen all the time to
some massive change in your business or in

3136
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:47,230
life and that change,

3137
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:48,293
uh,

3138
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,060
at first people deny that it's there,

3139
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:50,810
right?

3140
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:53,720
They deny it and then they say it's a
niche and then they say it's a blip.

3141
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:58,190
And then by the time that it's actually
in the heat of something scary or

3142
01:36:58,191 --> 01:36:59,090
challenging happening,

3143
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:02,870
you've wasted two or three years that you
could've used adapting to be ready for

3144
01:37:02,871 --> 01:37:03,030
it.

3145
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:03,480
Yeah.

3146
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,260
You know what I mean?

3147
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:04,520
No.

3148
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,353
Do you know what you mean?

3149
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:05,910
Yeah.

3150
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:06,331
I mean,

3151
01:37:06,331 --> 01:37:11,310
I think that what would you got to
do when you have a champion that has

3152
01:37:11,311 --> 01:37:12,450
spectacular results?

3153
01:37:12,630 --> 01:37:14,720
Like Amanda knows you've got
to hype the shit out of her.

3154
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:15,683
Invest,

3155
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:16,380
invest,

3156
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:17,400
hype the shit out of her.

3157
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,680
And that would have made
the Ronda Rousey fight.

3158
01:37:19,681 --> 01:37:23,250
I think even bigger if you show
her smashing me should Tate,

3159
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,113
you show her,

3160
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:24,481
you know,

3161
01:37:24,481 --> 01:37:25,890
smashing Sarah McMahon,

3162
01:37:25,891 --> 01:37:28,660
you show what she's capable
of like she's a fucking once

3163
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:29,370
for sure.

3164
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:29,731
For sure.

3165
01:37:29,731 --> 01:37:34,440
And you talked to Mike Brown or anyone
there who's been around the greats and

3166
01:37:34,441 --> 01:37:35,460
that they talk about it.

3167
01:37:35,461 --> 01:37:40,461
But this level now where they are the
brilliance of where what we've seen.

3168
01:37:40,711 --> 01:37:45,300
It's another example if you think that
only fighting to stand up when you're in

3169
01:37:45,301 --> 01:37:46,134
guard is right.

3170
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:46,890
Uh,

3171
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:48,930
or only keeping somebody down as the game.

3172
01:37:48,931 --> 01:37:50,100
And the only thing you
have to worry about us,

3173
01:37:50,101 --> 01:37:50,760
they'll stand up,

3174
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,590
they'll submit you,

3175
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:51,740
right?

3176
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:54,740
Like as soon as you don't
recognize where you are in,

3177
01:37:54,741 --> 01:37:56,010
in change of the,

3178
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,960
the river of life and time,

3179
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,700
you sometimes get fucked up.

3180
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:00,420
And,

3181
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:01,253
and uh,

3182
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:01,921
you know,

3183
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:02,191
it's a,

3184
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:03,001
it's a fascinating thing.

3185
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:06,240
I know I literally was just in Singapore
and I just spent days with this

3186
01:38:06,241 --> 01:38:07,050
company,

3187
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:09,450
but they see the world differently.

3188
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:12,300
They're strategy is simply,

3189
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:12,890
they're a,

3190
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:17,640
they're a values based company that
believes in the values of these things and

3191
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:18,474
tries to,

3192
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:22,200
to show people and share martial
artists reef for the greater good.

3193
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,000
And it's not some business,

3194
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,220
it's what they truly believe.

3195
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:29,100
They truly are going
about and making choices.

3196
01:38:29,101 --> 01:38:30,450
And when chattery says,

3197
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:33,480
I would not hire Conor
McGregor because he represents,

3198
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:38,540
he's dead fucking serious people who
represent his ideas is and what he sees,

3199
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:41,370
and I shouldn't speak for him at all.

3200
01:38:41,371 --> 01:38:42,480
He's a brilliant man.

3201
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:42,901
By the way,

3202
01:38:42,901 --> 01:38:43,291
this guy,

3203
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:43,710
he's a chef,

3204
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:46,290
he was a homeless kid with,

3205
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:49,710
with a single parent that
later became educated.

3206
01:38:49,711 --> 01:38:53,790
And then moved to America and went to
Harvard and then started managing a

3207
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:56,250
corporate funds and
became a Moitai champion.

3208
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:57,930
And this is all easily documented.

3209
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,390
This is who that individual is.

3210
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,320
And he's lived that life based on honor,

3211
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:05,154
respect,

3212
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:06,310
you know,

3213
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:06,900
um,

3214
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,340
teamwork excellence,

3215
01:39:08,341 --> 01:39:09,180
that mind,

3216
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:11,280
that is what built that company.

3217
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:15,690
And one is a billion dollar company now
it's $1 billion company that's in 1.7

3218
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,980
billion homes in Asia.

3219
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,740
This isn't some mythological idea.

3220
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:24,510
This is a guy who's built a
massive company based around
these values and that's

3221
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:25,530
a different thing.

3222
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:25,981
He's been,

3223
01:39:25,981 --> 01:39:26,850
what does he say about common?

3224
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:27,330
Oh,

3225
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:27,810
sorry.

3226
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:28,230
Yeah,

3227
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,100
I go off on this.

3228
01:39:29,101 --> 01:39:29,310
No,

3229
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:29,870
it's cool.

3230
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:30,270
Uh,

3231
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:34,890
so he looks at it as the things
that he says and the way that,

3232
01:39:34,891 --> 01:39:35,251
and again,

3233
01:39:35,251 --> 01:39:36,150
I shouldn't speak for him,

3234
01:39:36,151 --> 01:39:36,840
this was the,

3235
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,673
what I've gathered,

3236
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:42,980
throwing things and creating conflict
and controversy as your currency is not

3237
01:39:42,991 --> 01:39:43,950
something to be proud of.

3238
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:44,521
It's an interesting,

3239
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:45,870
we were putting it as your currency.

3240
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,130
Yeah,

3241
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:47,460
yeah.

3242
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:48,120
I get it.

3243
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:48,810
You know,

3244
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,250
and that sounds because,

3245
01:39:50,251 --> 01:39:51,890
and I'm not quite all the,

3246
01:39:51,891 --> 01:39:53,250
although I've drank the Koolaid,

3247
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:55,680
I believe in what they're
doing and I see it as real,

3248
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,900
not only cause my values line up with it,

3249
01:39:57,901 --> 01:40:01,530
but I think they are going to grow
dramatically as a result of some of these,

3250
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:02,850
the way they see the world.

3251
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:03,960
But not only that,

3252
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,100
but I'm still also immersed
here and I like Connor,

3253
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:10,050
I think of Connor,

3254
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:15,030
I worked for TSN because Connor fell out
of a march to a red carpet to shake my

3255
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:17,070
hand while the my boss was watching.

3256
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,060
You know what I mean?

3257
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:18,780
Yeah,

3258
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:18,961
yeah.

3259
01:40:18,961 --> 01:40:20,220
Like the great,

3260
01:40:20,221 --> 01:40:23,130
some of the most interesting moments I've
had are with that guy and some of the

3261
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,180
most interesting,

3262
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:25,051
you know,

3263
01:40:25,051 --> 01:40:29,760
many dozens of hours of trying to figure
out what's happening in research and

3264
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:31,440
growth has happened by studying that guy.

3265
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:33,510
And I see his,

3266
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:38,690
the games that he is willing to play as
part of his strategy for success as a

3267
01:40:39,151 --> 01:40:43,650
fighter and success trying to be
successful for his family and his future.

3268
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:45,990
I see it all connected
so I don't dislike him,

3269
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:47,300
but I respect this,

3270
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:52,410
this idea that conflict and
controversy are not good for us.

3271
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:53,290
I understand.

3272
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,340
But I also understand

3273
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:57,010
psychological warfare and I think
the condor is a master of that.

3274
01:40:57,011 --> 01:40:58,780
And that has a huge factor in victory.

3275
01:40:58,781 --> 01:40:59,021
I mean,

3276
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:01,690
this is something Miyamoto
Musashi use to his advantage.

3277
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:02,860
Um,

3278
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:03,201
you know,

3279
01:41:03,201 --> 01:41:03,460
when you,

3280
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,870
if you read the book of five rings,

3281
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:05,800
he,

3282
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:09,520
what Connor's doing is fucking with
people's heads the point where they,

3283
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:13,630
he has space in their head and
then Conor goes into the cage,

3284
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:15,040
like loose as a goose,

3285
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,110
relaxed and calm.

3286
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:18,580
So he's letting you know,

3287
01:41:18,581 --> 01:41:20,080
I don't give a fuck about you,

3288
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:23,500
but you give a fuck about me and
I'm going to fuck you up right now.

3289
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:23,801
And you're like,

3290
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:23,981
no,

3291
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:24,401
you're not.

3292
01:41:24,401 --> 01:41:25,061
You better not.

3293
01:41:25,061 --> 01:41:25,531
You can't,

3294
01:41:25,531 --> 01:41:26,050
I can't.

3295
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:26,883
This is too much.

3296
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:29,020
And Josie Aldo is the perfect example,

3297
01:41:29,021 --> 01:41:34,021
although was so out of composure a
although charged at him with that just

3298
01:41:34,331 --> 01:41:37,660
leaping left hook and just got
fucking waylaid on the way in.

3299
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,590
And Eddie Alvarez,

3300
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:39,850
the greatest game day performer,

3301
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:42,340
one of the Great Game Day
performance we've ever seen.

3302
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:44,410
And I talked to Ldl,

3303
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:49,440
that is one of my favorites and I
admire and am inspired by Eddie Alvarez,

3304
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:51,460
Michael Chandler too.

3305
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:54,070
You know those two are
like the same guy I lost.

3306
01:41:54,071 --> 01:41:54,904
You know,

3307
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,673
Eddie was like,

3308
01:41:56,740 --> 01:42:01,740
the plan was to wrestle a lot and stay
at distance and barely at all and I

3309
01:42:01,751 --> 01:42:05,050
stayed at distance almost the whole time
and barely Russell like he's just like,

3310
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:06,710
it was real like an I.

3311
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:11,200
And by not accepting it was real coming
in and suddenly you find yourself in

3312
01:42:11,201 --> 01:42:13,090
there and it's real and you
feel different and your,

3313
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:13,721
you know,

3314
01:42:13,721 --> 01:42:16,540
your mind is working differently and
your hormones are working differently and

3315
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:18,790
who you are and that moment
is different and you're like,

3316
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:19,661
holy fuck,

3317
01:42:19,661 --> 01:42:20,350
it's real.

3318
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:22,270
Had I prepared for it to be real?

3319
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:24,100
I could be in a different state right now,

3320
01:42:24,101 --> 01:42:27,010
but I denied that this was going to
be real and now it's fucking real.

3321
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,430
Santa Claus is real.

3322
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:29,651
It's real.

3323
01:42:29,651 --> 01:42:32,500
I also think you got clipped
early and I think that's a factor.

3324
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:32,801
You know,

3325
01:42:32,801 --> 01:42:36,220
you get caught on the chin like that and
your legs give out real quick and you,

3326
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:36,760
you're just,

3327
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,550
your brain doesn't work right and know
your body doesn't work right anymore.

3328
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:40,510
I think that's a factor.

3329
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:45,810
The ability that Connor has to land those
sharp shots that come out of nowhere

3330
01:42:46,421 --> 01:42:51,100
and blitz you and come at you so fast
and just drop those shots on you.

3331
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:55,540
I mean his left hand is a fucking laser
beam and that's so good planning it.

3332
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:56,740
That's what that is.

3333
01:42:56,741 --> 01:42:58,210
The definition of it.

3334
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:03,070
He's so good at landing that shot and
he's also good at landing a bunch of other

3335
01:43:03,071 --> 01:43:03,640
shit too.

3336
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:03,971
Man,

3337
01:43:03,971 --> 01:43:05,110
me pick you apart.

3338
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,161
He's a,

3339
01:43:06,161 --> 01:43:07,390
he's a real dynamo.

3340
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,253
I just,

3341
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:12,730
I hate to see things like what happened
in New York and Brooklyn and he threw

3342
01:43:12,731 --> 01:43:15,100
the Dolly at the bus
and smashed the window.

3343
01:43:15,101 --> 01:43:15,461
It's like,

3344
01:43:15,461 --> 01:43:17,680
so it's so fucking stupid.

3345
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:21,820
All that thuggish shit running in with
a bunch of other guys and everyone's

3346
01:43:21,821 --> 01:43:23,620
screaming at w was what?

3347
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:24,490
What did he do?

3348
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:27,550
He smacked your friend in the face because
your friend friend was talking shit.

3349
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:28,301
So you know,

3350
01:43:28,301 --> 01:43:28,571
I mean,

3351
01:43:28,571 --> 01:43:30,690
and even the way smacked
him was pretty general.

3352
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,051
You know what I mean?

3353
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:35,020
And Artem called him a
coward and he said didn't,

3354
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:37,090
he doesn't find Connor's a real fighters.

3355
01:43:37,091 --> 01:43:37,420
Like,

3356
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:38,253
listen man,

3357
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:39,510
he's rushing.

3358
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:40,413
You're rushing.

3359
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,070
You guys got to sort this out on your own.

3360
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:43,270
That is how they sorted it out.

3361
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:44,050
And look,

3362
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:46,600
it was a pretty calm
sorting out in my opinion.

3363
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:47,800
I mean they didn't stomp him,

3364
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:49,270
they didn't beat his ass.

3365
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:51,160
But once we get to that point,

3366
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,160
I mean I get

3367
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:52,330
it.

3368
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:52,480
They,

3369
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:52,630
yeah,

3370
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:53,031
once we,

3371
01:43:53,031 --> 01:43:56,660
you're doing something and I'm responding
what's he responds that happens every

3372
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:57,201
day in gangs,

3373
01:43:57,201 --> 01:43:57,891
in wars,

3374
01:43:57,891 --> 01:44:01,820
in Northern Ireland and Ireland and all
types of religions that's been going on

3375
01:44:01,821 --> 01:44:02,480
forever.

3376
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,640
Nobody ever wins when that happens,

3377
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:05,120
it just goes,

3378
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,350
it just perpetuates it.

3379
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:09,170
And when you watch it and then
there'll be a lot of people,

3380
01:44:09,171 --> 01:44:14,171
you see this scenario and like Habib's
fans or friends or supporters and condos

3381
01:44:15,261 --> 01:44:16,094
and they're like,

3382
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:16,281
oh,

3383
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:17,060
he did this.

3384
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:18,080
They're both wrong.

3385
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:19,003
And nobody,

3386
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:20,240
everybody always,

3387
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,550
when somebody does something
bad to somebody else,

3388
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:25,010
they almost always feel like
something was but done bad to them.

3389
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,530
Very few people instigate
that was perceived.

3390
01:44:27,531 --> 01:44:28,364
Something happened.

3391
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:32,960
They perceive a slight and you know
some people you do one thing to them and

3392
01:44:32,961 --> 01:44:33,441
then they're like,

3393
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:34,340
okay mother fucker,

3394
01:44:34,341 --> 01:44:35,660
now it's to eternity.

3395
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:38,840
Well that doesn't make any sense either.

3396
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:40,730
You look like a fool,

3397
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:42,293
you know,

3398
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,870
you just can't throw a dolly at a bus.

3399
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:45,380
No.

3400
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:45,741
You know,

3401
01:44:45,741 --> 01:44:48,560
filled with other fighters
because it's so selfish.

3402
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:50,750
I mean all those people that got caught,

3403
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:51,501
you know,

3404
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:54,710
I mean Ray Borg got cuts in his eyes.

3405
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:56,510
I mean this is the whole
thing is a disaster.

3406
01:44:56,660 --> 01:45:00,020
So my theory based on
bits of information that,

3407
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:02,810
that we have is that Connor,

3408
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:03,644
on some level,

3409
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:04,340
it really,

3410
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,650
I mean it reinforces constantly.

3411
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:06,930
If he,

3412
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:10,700
if your kid does something terrible that
we know is bad and he'd give him candy

3413
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:14,270
every time they're going to do
some batch yet give her candy.

3414
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:15,710
Every time she does something,

3415
01:45:15,711 --> 01:45:18,050
that reward conn has been rewarded.

3416
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:19,101
He gets richer,

3417
01:45:19,101 --> 01:45:19,671
more famous,

3418
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:20,630
more influential,

3419
01:45:20,631 --> 01:45:21,351
the belts.

3420
01:45:21,351 --> 01:45:26,060
And he's been given candy
every time he's done this.

3421
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:26,960
And it works.

3422
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:27,920
And I mean,

3423
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,890
there is parallels in the
political system in America.

3424
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:34,790
There's parallels all over the world
that by acting out in these strange ways,

3425
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:37,760
it's so bizarre and
unsettling that we reward it.

3426
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:39,220
You know that name for a band?

3427
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:40,190
Candy for Babby.

3428
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:41,240
Yeah,

3429
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:41,480
that'd be,

3430
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,670
there's a punk band,

3431
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:45,590
but that's what's happening.

3432
01:45:45,591 --> 01:45:45,801
Right?

3433
01:45:45,801 --> 01:45:48,650
And so now we take it and he's,

3434
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:50,920
and then you add the strategy
element that you're talking about,

3435
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:51,111
right?

3436
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:52,550
So he's looking at it and it's like,

3437
01:45:52,551 --> 01:45:53,384
okay,

3438
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:53,990
uh,

3439
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:55,280
Habib would be a great fight.

3440
01:45:55,281 --> 01:45:56,270
I'd like to fight in Russia.

3441
01:45:56,271 --> 01:45:58,280
He likes challenges is as hard,

3442
01:45:58,281 --> 01:45:59,114
but let's do it.

3443
01:45:59,360 --> 01:45:59,541
Now,

3444
01:45:59,541 --> 01:46:02,150
if I create some viral controversy,

3445
01:46:02,151 --> 01:46:03,230
which I did with,

3446
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:03,941
with Paulie,

3447
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:04,774
Mala nausea,

3448
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,870
who's a have you,

3449
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,213
do you know Polly?

3450
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:08,450
I've only talked to him on Twitter.

3451
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:09,120
I don't know.

3452
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,250
I fucking love Polly.

3453
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,240
And I like him as a dude.

3454
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,133
I really do.

3455
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,010
Um,

3456
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:16,340
uh,

3457
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:16,701
but,

3458
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:17,534
uh,

3459
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:19,850
so he created that in
the work and it's like,

3460
01:46:19,851 --> 01:46:20,420
okay,

3461
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:20,751
whether,

3462
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:23,120
how on what level he's strategizing this,

3463
01:46:23,121 --> 01:46:23,840
he's like,

3464
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,190
let's go do some pushing.

3465
01:46:25,191 --> 01:46:27,470
And shoving with Habib and has
guys some given the finger,

3466
01:46:27,471 --> 01:46:28,550
it'll be caught on cameras.

3467
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,120
What?

3468
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,500
What one thing we know about Connor,

3469
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:31,370
he's always late,

3470
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:33,103
always late.

3471
01:46:33,110 --> 01:46:34,910
He didn't plan to get there
when they're on a bus.

3472
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,740
He planned to get there
when they're in the hall.

3473
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:37,671
He planned to get there.

3474
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:41,030
When does a bunch of people around it's
security and it's easy to manage little

3475
01:46:41,031 --> 01:46:44,930
push and little shove in a couple of
cameras and all of a sudden his $5 million

3476
01:46:44,931 --> 01:46:47,990
pay day is a $12 million payday in
Russia and everybody's going crazy.

3477
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:48,381
It'll work.

3478
01:46:48,381 --> 01:46:48,990
It's brilliant.

3479
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:49,823
But he's late.

3480
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,690
So he shows up there on the bus.

3481
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:53,670
Now the cameras are out
and what's he going to do?

3482
01:46:53,671 --> 01:46:54,660
He's got to perform.

3483
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:55,890
He came there to perform it,

3484
01:46:55,891 --> 01:46:56,730
came there to do a thing.

3485
01:46:56,731 --> 01:46:58,020
We showed up and now it,

3486
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:03,260
now it goes sideways and that's the
most likely scenario is that it was a,

3487
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:04,800
let's do it.

3488
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,580
It'll be,

3489
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,260
it'll feel right for us as,

3490
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,760
as defending our friend,

3491
01:47:08,761 --> 01:47:12,110
but also it will have some inherent
value in the cameras come out and nobody

3492
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,501
will get hurt.

3493
01:47:12,501 --> 01:47:12,590
Yeah.

3494
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:13,070
Well,

3495
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:14,360
I think you're probably right there.

3496
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:15,050
It's got to get,

3497
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:15,920
he's got a good point,

3498
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:20,060
but obviously it's a terrible
thing to do and stupid.

3499
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:20,601
You know,

3500
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:20,811
there's,

3501
01:47:20,811 --> 01:47:22,160
there's a way to manage that,

3502
01:47:22,161 --> 01:47:23,120
but then is people say,

3503
01:47:23,121 --> 01:47:23,450
well,

3504
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:23,691
you know,

3505
01:47:23,691 --> 01:47:26,450
now it becomes like the WWE and you know,

3506
01:47:26,451 --> 01:47:27,040
there's,

3507
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:32,040
there's people that love real fighting
that have a real hard time with these

3508
01:47:32,661 --> 01:47:37,661
fake WWE style scenarios where you
know that whether it's Colby Covington,

3509
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:39,670
yeah.

3510
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:39,891
You know,

3511
01:47:39,891 --> 01:47:41,750
like he did a promo recently.

3512
01:47:41,751 --> 01:47:42,584
We had a,

3513
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:47,180
a girl by the pool and the girl
sat in his lap and she was like,

3514
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:52,210
obviously had a plan script and
it seemed kind of Corny people.

3515
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:56,120
There's people who think that's great
and there's people fucking hate it.

3516
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:57,013
I'm the hate it.

3517
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:57,411
Yeah.

3518
01:47:57,411 --> 01:47:58,191
I'm the heated too.

3519
01:47:58,191 --> 01:47:59,024
I don't,

3520
01:47:59,090 --> 01:47:59,331
I mean,

3521
01:47:59,331 --> 01:48:00,950
I don't have a real
problem with pro wrestling.

3522
01:48:00,951 --> 01:48:04,010
I joke around about it all the time
and I get the fact that people like it.

3523
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:07,130
I don't like that kind of
shit bleeding into MMA.

3524
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,090
I think it's dumb

3525
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:09,290
bad.

3526
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:10,123
It's also,

3527
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:10,850
I mean,

3528
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:11,683
again,

3529
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:17,230
if you're viewing it as inspiring
artistry with which there are lessons to

3530
01:48:17,661 --> 01:48:20,600
fucking live your life on one hand and on,

3531
01:48:20,601 --> 01:48:22,970
and then that's how I truly see it,

3532
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,790
an interface with it
and experience it and,

3533
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,280
and share it and,

3534
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:30,020
and want to see people get to feel that.

3535
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,250
And then on the other hand,

3536
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:35,390
you're sort of putting together these
weird scripts to sell pay per views,

3537
01:48:35,391 --> 01:48:39,530
but I mean wrestling that stuff that
came up in wrestling because it isn't

3538
01:48:39,531 --> 01:48:40,960
inherently real.

3539
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,580
It needed those extras.

3540
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:43,820
It needed all that stuff.

3541
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:47,180
If we understood how
brilliant Colby Covington was,

3542
01:48:47,181 --> 01:48:50,150
if we understood how brilliant
of a combat sportsman he was,

3543
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:51,680
he wouldn't have to do that.

3544
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,900
But he's doing that and that's
what got him a title shot.

3545
01:48:53,930 --> 01:48:54,141
Right?

3546
01:48:54,141 --> 01:48:54,920
So on the other side,

3547
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:55,880
the other side of the coin,

3548
01:48:55,881 --> 01:48:56,630
we're wrong.

3549
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:59,930
You want to know if we understood
he would get it based on that.

3550
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,370
But we don't understand.

3551
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:01,810
We,

3552
01:49:01,810 --> 01:49:02,601
we the royal,

3553
01:49:02,601 --> 01:49:03,800
we don't get it.

3554
01:49:03,801 --> 01:49:08,210
It's like I'll see people talk about
fighting after and there'll be like there

3555
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:09,230
and some people's,

3556
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:13,900
this is their idea of covering a fight
and our fans or people and everybody's

3557
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:14,750
entitled to their own thing.

3558
01:49:14,751 --> 01:49:15,584
But they'll be like,

3559
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:16,011
yeah,

3560
01:49:16,011 --> 01:49:16,161
the,

3561
01:49:16,161 --> 01:49:17,990
the show was kind of a lackluster fair.

3562
01:49:17,991 --> 01:49:18,890
Not a lot of finishes.

3563
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:19,600
Fuck.

3564
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:24,600
Could you have 20 brilliant athletes have
it interact and some that your opinion

3565
01:49:25,221 --> 01:49:28,850
of how it did or it didn't
excite you is super valid to you.

3566
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:31,050
But that's not what we were watching that.

3567
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:31,240
Right.

3568
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,410
But what I'm talking about is
like what got him a title shot?

3569
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:36,830
My title shot is being an asshole
because of the reality that we live in.

3570
01:49:36,831 --> 01:49:37,650
That's what he had to do.

3571
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:37,821
Right,

3572
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:37,910
right.

3573
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:40,040
I mean like what he did in
Brazil after he beat Damien,

3574
01:49:40,041 --> 01:49:41,380
Maia said this is a shit hole.

3575
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:43,190
That's literally what
got him the title shot.

3576
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:44,720
I mean if you really
stop and think about it,

3577
01:49:44,721 --> 01:49:45,500
he's ranked,

3578
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,730
what does he ranked number three?

3579
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:49,630
He's only beaten Maya and
he's beaten some other people,

3580
01:49:49,631 --> 01:49:54,010
but it terms of top 10 contenders in
terms of like real world class fighters,

3581
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:57,340
there's a lot of guys that are out
there that have fucked up a lot of other

3582
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:58,570
people like wonder boy.

3583
01:49:58,580 --> 01:49:58,931
It was like,

3584
01:49:58,931 --> 01:50:01,750
how is this guy fighting for the
title and for an interim title?

3585
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:02,584
And I'm not.

3586
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:05,710
After he's gone through those two
big fights with Tyron Woodley,

3587
01:50:05,950 --> 01:50:06,431
beaten,

3588
01:50:06,431 --> 01:50:07,080
Jorge Mas,

3589
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:07,570
doll,

3590
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:10,180
beaten all these debate and Johnny
Hendricks beaten all of these different

3591
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:10,870
fighters.

3592
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:15,290
Colby beat Damien Maia and that's the
really the big name on his resume and

3593
01:50:15,330 --> 01:50:15,520
yeah,

3594
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,070
but it's also because he's going to
be fighting Hofeld dos Anjos who's a

3595
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:18,904
Brazilian.

3596
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,830
He said a lot of stupid shit about Brazil.

3597
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:21,531
Brazilians hate.

3598
01:50:21,531 --> 01:50:22,990
And Brazil's a giant market.

3599
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:25,130
It's an easy sell and this is,

3600
01:50:25,170 --> 01:50:27,760
this is what he's talked himself
into and it's a tough fight.

3601
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:29,170
Don't make no mistake about it.

3602
01:50:29,171 --> 01:50:32,410
The guy that beat Damien Maia
is a tough fucking fighter.

3603
01:50:32,411 --> 01:50:33,730
Colby A.

3604
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:33,840
Yeah.

3605
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:34,740
And again,

3606
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:39,690
you talked to Dean Thomas or Mike Brown
and they two years back when they were

3607
01:50:39,691 --> 01:50:39,901
taught.

3608
01:50:39,901 --> 01:50:40,600
And I would,

3609
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,930
I'm the Jorge Mass fuddled freak,

3610
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:43,500
right?

3611
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,750
That's one of those special artists to me.

3612
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:47,130
And so I'll be asking,

3613
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:47,551
you know,

3614
01:50:47,551 --> 01:50:51,480
like when I'll see Mike or a dean or
these guys or anybody around that,

3615
01:50:51,481 --> 01:50:51,751
I'm like,

3616
01:50:51,751 --> 01:50:51,961
hey,

3617
01:50:51,961 --> 01:50:52,231
how's,

3618
01:50:52,231 --> 01:50:52,951
how's Jorge doing?

3619
01:50:52,951 --> 01:50:53,820
What's he working on?

3620
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:56,710
What is he changes and they'll talk on,

3621
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:57,810
he's always training with Colby.

3622
01:50:57,811 --> 01:50:58,580
He's a fuck.

3623
01:50:58,580 --> 01:50:59,430
He's a deadly,

3624
01:50:59,431 --> 01:51:00,990
he's one of the greats in the Jim Hill.

3625
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:03,180
The two of them are first
there last to leave.

3626
01:51:03,181 --> 01:51:07,620
Like you've heard about how good
he was under that public surface.

3627
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:08,340
And I,

3628
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:09,390
but I see what you're saying,

3629
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:11,910
based on what we've created,

3630
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:17,420
he doesn't have much of a choice if he
wants to achieve his goals other than

3631
01:51:17,761 --> 01:51:18,301
doing it this way.

3632
01:51:18,301 --> 01:51:19,470
And the guys who are good at it,

3633
01:51:19,471 --> 01:51:19,861
jail,

3634
01:51:19,861 --> 01:51:22,140
obviously the jail is like
really good at one of the best,

3635
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:22,983
whatever greatness.

3636
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:23,940
And he's an entertainer.

3637
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:24,360
Yeah.

3638
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:25,410
And don't you love jail?

3639
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:27,360
I love chatting fucking love child.

3640
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:32,750
And yet this is something
I find distasteful about
this art form is that game

3641
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,700
yet somehow channel is so lovable.

3642
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:36,751
I love child.

3643
01:51:36,751 --> 01:51:37,130
Right?

3644
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:42,130
But it's because there's a natural love
of that kind of performance and Colby

3645
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:46,530
and I've played around with it a little
bit when I played in a band where you

3646
01:51:46,531 --> 01:51:48,990
would be rude and arrogant
and play that kind of game.

3647
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:50,280
It's not,

3648
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:51,713
it's hard.

3649
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:52,770
It's hard.

3650
01:51:52,770 --> 01:51:53,400
It's hard to do.

3651
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,680
It's hard when it's hard to be convincing.

3652
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:57,600
It's also hard to be hated all the time.

3653
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,441
That's real.

3654
01:51:58,441 --> 01:51:59,010
Like you,

3655
01:51:59,010 --> 01:52:04,010
you will feel the hatred of the all
Brazilians who truly hate you even though

3656
01:52:05,431 --> 01:52:06,490
you were playing a game.

3657
01:52:06,491 --> 01:52:07,920
Getting real about that shit.

3658
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:10,550
Zillions are extremely patriotic,

3659
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:12,110
very nationalistic.

3660
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:13,640
You Talk Shit about Brazil,

3661
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,630
you better duck.

3662
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,310
Yeah.

3663
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:16,490
Hey,

3664
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:17,530
they know the boomerang.

3665
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,393
And in fact,

3666
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:25,450
even if you were talked to somebody like
a stereotypically passionate person,

3667
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:29,240
we're talking about here and you
said it's a joke and they'd be like,

3668
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:31,820
you can't make that joke right there.

3669
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:32,930
Point isn't that.

3670
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:34,760
I don't care if he was kidding.

3671
01:52:35,030 --> 01:52:39,830
The fact that he was willing to do that
is so disrespectful to all of us that we

3672
01:52:39,831 --> 01:52:41,000
must slit his throat.

3673
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:44,690
And that's what they'll chant when he
goes to walk out there and they mean it.

3674
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:45,740
They do mean it.

3675
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:46,280
But meanwhile

3676
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,150
he just doubled down.

3677
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:49,610
He didn't give a fuck even after he
got hit in the head with the boomerang,

3678
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:51,140
still doubling down,

3679
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:52,400
swinging for the fences.

3680
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:53,151
What other choice,

3681
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:53,984
I guess,

3682
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,440
look,

3683
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:59,440
it has got him to the dance and if he
wins two Saturdays from this one or one

3684
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:01,610
Saturday,

3685
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:02,930
how's it going next one,

3686
01:53:02,931 --> 01:53:04,100
his tail and Wonderboy.

3687
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,113
Yeah,

3688
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:06,930
that's another one to talk about it.

3689
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:07,690
Yeah.

3690
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:08,780
But if he wins,

3691
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:10,190
if he wins,

3692
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:11,330
he will have a belt.

3693
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:11,661
I mean,

3694
01:53:11,661 --> 01:53:13,520
it's not the real belt.

3695
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:14,870
I mean it's an interim belt,

3696
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:17,270
but it guarantees them
a shot at the real belt.

3697
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:17,940
Yeah.

3698
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:18,171
You know,

3699
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:19,610
so it gets very interesting.

3700
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,100
So he's like,

3701
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:26,800
I know that I my look at these sort of
systems and the areas around that I have

3702
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:31,700
a negative bias.

3703
01:53:31,701 --> 01:53:32,200
Like,

3704
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:32,450
you know,

3705
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:33,283
it's not about that.

3706
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:34,310
And I know that's,

3707
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:39,650
that's negative to me about the belt
or the rankings or beef or whatever.

3708
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:43,430
But the belt cannot mean
what it meant before.

3709
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:47,810
By the nature of once upon a time
there were only ever 27 of them and now

3710
01:53:47,811 --> 01:53:49,400
there's been 340 of them.

3711
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:52,310
By nature it cannot be as
valuable as it once was.

3712
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:52,910
Right.

3713
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,410
And when there's two in yours,

3714
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:58,880
it inherently cannot have
the value because scarcity
is where value comes from.

3715
01:53:58,970 --> 01:53:59,181
Yeah.

3716
01:53:59,181 --> 01:54:00,860
It's really just a promotional tool.

3717
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,240
It's a marketing tool and it's a,

3718
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:03,710
it's a questionable one.

3719
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:04,281
You know,

3720
01:54:04,281 --> 01:54:04,611
there's,

3721
01:54:04,611 --> 01:54:08,780
there's a real good argument that it's
a bad idea to have these interim title

3722
01:54:08,781 --> 01:54:09,860
shots because you know,

3723
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:10,100
like,

3724
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:10,640
okay,

3725
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,570
well what's the rules?

3726
01:54:11,571 --> 01:54:13,490
You just decide when to
have an interim shot,

3727
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,230
especially with a guy like Tony Ferguson,

3728
01:54:15,231 --> 01:54:15,590
right?

3729
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:20,090
He Beats Kevin Lee Spectacular
Phi triangles and off
lost to nobody after that

3730
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:21,830
last one.

3731
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:26,060
One the interim title and then you
strip it because he falls down during a

3732
01:54:26,061 --> 01:54:26,690
promotion.

3733
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:28,100
He trips on some wires.

3734
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:29,300
I mean this isn't,

3735
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:33,680
I mean it's not like you went and did
something stupid outside of fighting.

3736
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:36,800
He was just doing a promotion
and tripped on some wires.

3737
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:40,340
So freak accident and that really,

3738
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:44,390
if we move away all of the things and
just look at the systems at play and how

3739
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:45,224
and why it's there.

3740
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,161
If he was,

3741
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:48,620
if he had another 2 million
Instagram followers,

3742
01:54:48,621 --> 01:54:49,454
that would not happen.

3743
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,690
You're right and that's it.

3744
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:51,231
You're right.

3745
01:54:51,231 --> 01:54:52,970
It's strictly that that is true,

3746
01:54:53,010 --> 01:54:53,380
right?

3747
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:53,840
Yeah.

3748
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,040
I mean Tony was a giant,

3749
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:55,940
huge star.

3750
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:57,050
There's no way they would strip them.

3751
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:57,530
No.

3752
01:54:57,530 --> 01:54:57,950
Yeah,

3753
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:58,460
no,

3754
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,660
but by not being,

3755
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:00,890
cause he's a character.

3756
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:01,310
He's,

3757
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:02,300
he's an odd ball.

3758
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:03,410
He has a unique,

3759
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:04,244
he's one of a kind.

3760
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:05,990
We should celebrate that.

3761
01:55:06,290 --> 01:55:07,370
He's one of a kind.

3762
01:55:07,371 --> 01:55:08,270
He's an individual.

3763
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:09,320
He's different than everybody.

3764
01:55:09,321 --> 01:55:10,154
That's awesome.

3765
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:11,270
If you're going to strip Connor,

3766
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:12,830
which they did and you have,

3767
01:55:12,831 --> 01:55:14,690
could be fight for the title,

3768
01:55:14,691 --> 01:55:16,610
the true title and you know,

3769
01:55:16,611 --> 01:55:16,911
look,

3770
01:55:16,911 --> 01:55:19,880
that's arguable whether or not you should
do that should probably be two interim

3771
01:55:19,881 --> 01:55:21,800
fights or to an interim titles,

3772
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:22,710
which will be cool.

3773
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:24,140
He's not beating the champion.

3774
01:55:24,141 --> 01:55:25,370
If he didn't beat the champion,

3775
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:26,540
he beat ally Quinta.

3776
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,940
How is him beating owl?

3777
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:30,750
I acquaint to a more valid
than Tony beating Kevin Lee.

3778
01:55:30,751 --> 01:55:31,461
That's crazy.

3779
01:55:31,461 --> 01:55:32,180
It isn't.

3780
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:32,931
It's crazy.

3781
01:55:32,931 --> 01:55:33,740
It doesn't make any sense.

3782
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:34,071
I mean,

3783
01:55:34,071 --> 01:55:35,740
not no taking anything away against Al,

3784
01:55:35,741 --> 01:55:38,540
but Al took that fight on
unfucking one day's notice.

3785
01:55:38,541 --> 01:55:38,910
Yeah.

3786
01:55:38,910 --> 01:55:42,590
So it's even more ridiculous and
awesome and awesome and awesome.

3787
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:43,780
That was a great fight.

3788
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:43,980
It was

3789
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,371
really fun.

3790
01:55:44,371 --> 01:55:44,870
Yeah.

3791
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:45,641
Well there's,

3792
01:55:45,641 --> 01:55:46,680
there's a bunch of,

3793
01:55:46,681 --> 01:55:46,831
yeah,

3794
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:48,630
it was really fun and I like,

3795
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,640
Quinta is another one of these guys.

3796
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:53,040
How can you not be inspired?

3797
01:55:53,041 --> 01:55:58,041
Seeing a guy like life is traveling along
and all of a sudden you have this one

3798
01:55:58,441 --> 01:55:59,400
shot at something,

3799
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:00,450
you're not ready.

3800
01:56:00,451 --> 01:56:01,171
You don't have,

3801
01:56:01,171 --> 01:56:02,700
you haven't prepared in the ways you want,

3802
01:56:02,701 --> 01:56:03,151
but you know what?

3803
01:56:03,151 --> 01:56:03,961
I'm going to go for it.

3804
01:56:03,961 --> 01:56:04,200
Right.

3805
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,700
That's a life lesson.

3806
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:08,390
And there's also like I,

3807
01:56:08,490 --> 01:56:12,360
there's a forgiving nature to this
machine that is kind of admirable.

3808
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:14,010
Like Alice created problems.

3809
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:18,420
Al Has had conflict with that company
and then they were still like,

3810
01:56:18,421 --> 01:56:18,841
you know what?

3811
01:56:18,841 --> 01:56:20,600
Let's do this area.

3812
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:21,430
The

3813
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:22,263
did it though.

3814
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,810
They did it because they wouldn't,

3815
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,160
they wouldn't use Paul Felder
the fucking athletic commission.

3816
01:56:28,161 --> 01:56:28,941
That's all ridiculous,

3817
01:56:28,941 --> 01:56:29,774
ridiculous.

3818
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:33,620
I mean all their wisdom,

3819
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:36,950
they decided that Paul Felder
isn't ranked high enough.

3820
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:37,610
Like

3821
01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:38,520
you don't know shit.

3822
01:56:38,521 --> 01:56:40,010
I don't even know where
rankings come from,

3823
01:56:40,011 --> 01:56:43,220
which is a bunch of people like
hanging out to kind of watch,

3824
01:56:43,221 --> 01:56:43,971
fighting a bunch of,

3825
01:56:43,971 --> 01:56:45,980
making an arbitrary choice
and then combining it.

3826
01:56:45,981 --> 01:56:46,650
Like,

3827
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:47,241
do you know what,

3828
01:56:47,241 --> 01:56:47,750
um,

3829
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:49,550
what a first class noticer is.

3830
01:56:49,551 --> 01:56:50,840
Have you ever heard this term a fa?

3831
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:55,860
So a first class noticer in business
or any number of things as somebody who

3832
01:56:56,650 --> 01:57:01,580
over times you start to see the different
systems and how they interact with

3833
01:57:01,581 --> 01:57:02,660
each other and you are one,

3834
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:05,600
you clearly are a first class noticer.

3835
01:57:05,601 --> 01:57:06,950
You see big picture,

3836
01:57:06,951 --> 01:57:07,611
small picture,

3837
01:57:07,611 --> 01:57:09,800
combine how the outside
right now you're like,

3838
01:57:09,801 --> 01:57:10,460
well the,

3839
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:13,250
the commission did this
but Paul felter did that.

3840
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,850
Rankings are this way and you're able to
pull all these things together and look

3841
01:57:16,851 --> 01:57:17,210
at it.

3842
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:17,720
Right?

3843
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:21,710
And if you look at any of these things
from that perspective of how the systems

3844
01:57:21,711 --> 01:57:22,190
all work,

3845
01:57:22,190 --> 01:57:24,080
the whole thing barely makes sense.

3846
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:24,920
You know what I mean?

3847
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:27,500
Paul Felder is brilliant.

3848
01:57:27,670 --> 01:57:28,030
Paul,

3849
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:29,690
if he's a dangerous fight day,

3850
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:35,150
including Khabib and committed
and mentally strong and a striver,

3851
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:38,670
worldclass striker and his
striking his fucking deadly.

3852
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:42,180
And he's not just a striker
in terms of punching like owl.

3853
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,040
He's a really nasty kicker.

3854
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:44,371
I mean,

3855
01:57:44,371 --> 01:57:44,971
Al can kick.

3856
01:57:44,971 --> 01:57:45,120
Yep,

3857
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:45,953
no doubt about it.

3858
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:48,690
But Paul was a bit more achieved in,

3859
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:49,290
in his,

3860
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:49,700
uh,

3861
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:51,870
he's got more weapons,

3862
01:57:51,871 --> 01:57:52,710
more complex,

3863
01:57:52,711 --> 01:57:57,711
spinning back fists and elbows and
knees and nasty leg kicks and you know,

3864
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:01,350
went three hard rounds with Barboza
and went toe to toe with them.

3865
01:58:01,351 --> 01:58:01,531
I mean,

3866
01:58:01,531 --> 01:58:02,251
he's that good.

3867
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:02,980
He's that good on it

3868
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:03,790
and smart.

3869
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:04,240
Yeah,

3870
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:04,670
he's,

3871
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:06,800
he's a great analyst
for a such a young one.

3872
01:58:06,801 --> 01:58:07,730
But when you look,

3873
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:08,181
so you're like,

3874
01:58:08,181 --> 01:58:09,380
how is that possible?

3875
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:12,770
Because that's really hard and it's a
different skill set than just being a good

3876
01:58:12,771 --> 01:58:16,730
fight this language and being able to
rationalize things and all these different

3877
01:58:16,731 --> 01:58:17,120
things.

3878
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:20,060
But you look back and he
did it on the small leaks,

3879
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:22,130
which he didn't need to do.

3880
01:58:22,190 --> 01:58:24,200
He pursued because it
was of interest to him.

3881
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:27,110
He pursued it to get good
at it because he loved it,

3882
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:29,960
which means he's predisposed
to thinking that way.

3883
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,610
So now you also have a thinker,

3884
01:58:32,090 --> 01:58:32,923
a fighter,

3885
01:58:34,010 --> 01:58:35,810
incredibly dangerous striker,

3886
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:40,190
a guy who can play complex games in
it and you in your infinite wisdom,

3887
01:58:40,191 --> 01:58:44,530
don't think he can fight Habib because
somebody somewhere said that he put a

3888
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:46,480
seven next to his name instead of a three.

3889
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:47,240
There was a lot

3890
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:47,630
real,

3891
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:51,490
real problems with the athletic
commission and we won't go into depth.

3892
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:52,970
I don't want to cause any problems.

3893
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:54,040
But uh,

3894
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:54,330
they,

3895
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:55,610
they had some real issues.

3896
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:56,230
They're young,

3897
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:56,780
they're new.

3898
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:57,021
Yeah,

3899
01:58:57,021 --> 01:58:57,890
there's a lot of nonsense.

3900
01:58:57,891 --> 01:58:59,090
It was going on behind the scenes.

3901
01:58:59,510 --> 01:59:01,760
But I think that what,

3902
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:06,620
what was interesting about that
fight was we got to see al step up.

3903
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:10,840
We got to see Khabib have some
issues with striking and you know,

3904
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:11,810
we got to see,

3905
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:13,393
I mean,

3906
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:14,331
what,

3907
01:59:14,331 --> 01:59:16,610
what I don't like about it is this whole,

3908
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:18,290
the whole championship thing.

3909
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:21,650
What I don't like about it is he didn't
beat the champion to become a champion.

3910
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:23,840
They just sort of like set this fight up.

3911
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:25,670
Al Wasn't preparing for that fight.

3912
01:59:25,671 --> 01:59:29,240
He was preparing for a three round
fight and then Tony gets stripped.

3913
01:59:29,241 --> 01:59:29,751
All those things.

3914
01:59:29,751 --> 01:59:30,550
I don't,

3915
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:30,970
yeah,

3916
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:32,860
it because they don't make any sense.

3917
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:33,660
They don't take anything,

3918
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:34,271
make any sense.

3919
01:59:34,271 --> 01:59:36,130
Because if we go back to the,

3920
01:59:36,290 --> 01:59:41,230
if we have some kind of value root of
what we're about other than the necessity

3921
01:59:41,231 --> 01:59:41,680
to,

3922
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:44,820
to sell things based on the
same marketing that we use,

3923
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:47,050
we wouldn't have to be in that situation,

3924
01:59:47,051 --> 01:59:49,840
but we find ourselves
there and when you're on,

3925
01:59:49,841 --> 01:59:51,400
when you're on the bottom of half guard,

3926
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:53,950
you just have to work your way out of
half guard and that's what that machine

3927
01:59:53,951 --> 01:59:57,160
has to do and that's what you
know Habib has to do and that's,

3928
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:58,450
you got an artificial stand up.

3929
01:59:58,780 --> 01:59:59,290
Yeah,

3930
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:00,123
exactly.

3931
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:03,091
Got stood up.

3932
02:00:03,091 --> 02:00:03,720
Exactly.

3933
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,080
Yeah.

3934
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:04,880
I don't know.

3935
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:07,680
I don't know Wonderboy until,

3936
02:00:07,681 --> 02:00:08,160
man,

3937
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:08,941
that's a big fire.

3938
02:00:08,941 --> 02:00:09,150
Yeah,

3939
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:10,020
that's a Saturday.

3940
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:10,830
That's fucking,

3941
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:11,810
that's chaos stuff.

3942
02:00:11,811 --> 02:00:13,440
Fight is very interesting to me.

3943
02:00:13,590 --> 02:00:14,371
I am very,

3944
02:00:14,371 --> 02:00:14,671
very,

3945
02:00:14,671 --> 02:00:16,050
very interested in that fight.

3946
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:16,920
Me Too.

3947
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:17,161
Yeah.

3948
02:00:17,161 --> 02:00:19,340
I want to see what happens
when till fights Wonderboy,

3949
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:24,350
because I was stunned by how easily till
ran through cowboy and cowboy in all

3950
02:00:25,981 --> 02:00:27,120
fairness is not,

3951
02:00:27,330 --> 02:00:28,141
in my opinion,

3952
02:00:28,141 --> 02:00:30,570
a real one 70 he's a tweener.

3953
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,020
I think cowboy would be a one 65 you know,

3954
02:00:34,021 --> 02:00:35,190
and I think maybe it,

3955
02:00:35,191 --> 02:00:38,340
his struggles to make one 55
maybe she'd be 10 pounds heavier.

3956
02:00:38,341 --> 02:00:41,460
And I think that 10 pound
weight class thing is real.

3957
02:00:41,461 --> 02:00:43,080
I think that's where it should be.

3958
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:44,610
Every 10 pounds.

3959
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:47,670
Darren till is a fucking huge guy.

3960
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:48,533
So Steve,

3961
02:00:48,690 --> 02:00:49,090
yeah,

3962
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:52,140
they're both very tall and strong,

3963
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,370
but till you know,

3964
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:56,150
regularly is well over a hundred I mean,

3965
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:57,690
well over 200 pounds.

3966
02:00:57,720 --> 02:00:58,110
Yeah.

3967
02:00:58,110 --> 02:00:59,520
He's walking around at like,

3968
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:00,930
um,

3969
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:01,291
you know,

3970
02:01:01,291 --> 02:01:05,430
fucking two oh five and shit and
cutting down to one 70 it's a good one,

3971
02:01:05,431 --> 02:01:05,700
man.

3972
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:06,533
It's a really,

3973
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:07,230
you know,

3974
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:10,920
there's so many little odd
ball variables and unknowns,

3975
02:01:10,921 --> 02:01:11,250
right?

3976
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:13,350
Like we literally,

3977
02:01:13,470 --> 02:01:15,090
when we go and we look at these,

3978
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:20,070
the more you've studied and analyzed
and commentated fighting for 20 years of

3979
02:01:20,071 --> 02:01:20,760
your life,

3980
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:23,070
the more you realize how
little we actually know.

3981
02:01:23,071 --> 02:01:27,210
Like we have about two or seven
or 18% of the actual information,

3982
02:01:27,570 --> 02:01:28,171
you know what I mean?

3983
02:01:28,171 --> 02:01:30,090
And we're trying to work
with it and the big one.

3984
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:30,840
So when,

3985
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:32,700
when Cody fought TJ or,

3986
02:01:32,701 --> 02:01:33,260
um,

3987
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:34,093
um,

3988
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,153
Dominic,

3989
02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:36,000
I was like,

3990
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,710
I just don't see how he can win.

3991
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:39,240
I don't see how Cody can win.

3992
02:01:39,650 --> 02:01:40,381
And then somebody to say,

3993
02:01:40,381 --> 02:01:40,491
well,

3994
02:01:40,491 --> 02:01:41,151
why did he say that?

3995
02:01:41,151 --> 02:01:41,931
He knocked out all these guys?

3996
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:42,141
I'm like,

3997
02:01:42,141 --> 02:01:42,471
well yeah,

3998
02:01:42,471 --> 02:01:44,450
it's hard to get to Dominic.

3999
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:47,450
And we've never seen evidence of
him doing well after those minutes.

4000
02:01:47,451 --> 02:01:49,610
The evidence isn't there to see it.

4001
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:51,590
Of course 100% wrong,

4002
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:53,090
but there,

4003
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:55,610
but you have to go by
what evidence you have.

4004
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:59,590
What have we seen or what information
have we gathered that can allow us to make

4005
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:01,610
a decision to me?

4006
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:03,380
Cody Garbrandt did not have,

4007
02:02:03,381 --> 02:02:05,750
there was no evidence he can
be Dominic and then boom,

4008
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:08,240
beats up Dominic and you're blown away.

4009
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:09,860
And that's an exciting feeling.

4010
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:11,001
And that is,

4011
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:12,080
I think what's at play here.

4012
02:02:12,290 --> 02:02:16,940
Is there any evidence that that Darren
till can do what Rory Macdonald couldn't

4013
02:02:16,941 --> 02:02:21,200
do and Jorge mass but all couldn't do
and get to a guy who has that movement,

4014
02:02:21,201 --> 02:02:23,360
that blitz thinking that karate's um,

4015
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:23,990
uh,

4016
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:25,670
those karate instincts
we were talking about,

4017
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:27,950
we've seen no real evidence of that.

4018
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:29,750
But that doesn't mean he can't do it.

4019
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,370
It doesn't mean he can't do it,

4020
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:32,870
but the evidence isn't there.

4021
02:02:32,871 --> 02:02:33,920
I don't know about that.

4022
02:02:33,921 --> 02:02:37,190
I was stunned by his ability to
close the distance on cowboy,

4023
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:38,450
that nasty left.

4024
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:38,681
Oh,

4025
02:02:38,681 --> 02:02:39,950
well they'll be landed over the top.

4026
02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:40,250
Yeah.

4027
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:41,570
The way he put them away.

4028
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:42,051
I don't know.

4029
02:02:42,051 --> 02:02:44,960
I think that's pretty good evidence
that he's a fucking monster.

4030
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:45,620
I agree.

4031
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:47,840
And his fights previous
in the UFC as well,

4032
02:02:47,841 --> 02:02:50,150
although they didn't have a
lot of fanfare behind him,

4033
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:51,141
you know,

4034
02:02:51,141 --> 02:02:52,100
stunning results.

4035
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:54,410
And then you talk to people that know him,

4036
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:54,891
you know,

4037
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:58,100
talk to people that know his striking
document and people that have seen him in

4038
02:02:58,101 --> 02:03:00,410
the gym and understand what
he's been through in his life.

4039
02:03:00,411 --> 02:03:01,400
And he's a young guy.

4040
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:04,170
I think he's only 25 how
old is Darren [inaudible]?

4041
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:07,610
I'm pretty sure he's 25 Celso never lost,

4042
02:03:07,611 --> 02:03:08,090
right?

4043
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:08,780
Never.

4044
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:09,630
It's a fucking beast,

4045
02:03:09,631 --> 02:03:09,950
man.

4046
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:10,120
Yeah.

4047
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:11,180
And then you see the pictures,

4048
02:03:11,181 --> 02:03:12,670
even the 25 years old.

4049
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:13,640
That's wild man.

4050
02:03:13,641 --> 02:03:16,370
And but what I'm saying is I would have,

4051
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:19,880
I would not be the slightest bit surprised
if he could do it because we've seen

4052
02:03:19,881 --> 02:03:24,740
enough over time to know that
what a 23 year old is capable of,

4053
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,750
they'll see the whole game differently.

4054
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:31,520
They'll see their understanding of where
they are in relation to the other guy

4055
02:03:31,521 --> 02:03:34,640
is so different that it just on one day,

4056
02:03:34,641 --> 02:03:37,340
all of a sudden all these 25 year
olds are just so fucking good.

4057
02:03:37,341 --> 02:03:40,070
And we don't really have
the language to explain why.

4058
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:41,270
You know,

4059
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:42,380
can we just say,

4060
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:42,831
oh,

4061
02:03:42,831 --> 02:03:45,020
he was able to close the
distance on Stephen Thompson.

4062
02:03:45,350 --> 02:03:46,040
If he does,

4063
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:46,850
we'll say yes,

4064
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:50,270
but then the question would be
how when nobody else could do it,

4065
02:03:50,630 --> 02:03:52,760
how and why could he do it?

4066
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:54,950
And that's always what obsesses me.

4067
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:56,660
If you see him do it,

4068
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:58,460
there is now the explanation isn't,

4069
02:03:58,670 --> 02:04:02,480
he was better at closing the distance
or his range management was excellent.

4070
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:02,781
Dot.

4071
02:04:02,781 --> 02:04:03,740
That's true for a bit.

4072
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:05,030
But then my next question,

4073
02:04:05,031 --> 02:04:06,140
the next morning we'll be like,

4074
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:07,490
how the fuck did he do it?

4075
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:07,940
What?

4076
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:09,200
What changed now?

4077
02:04:09,201 --> 02:04:10,230
What about the,

4078
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:12,620
the entirety of the game itself,

4079
02:04:12,621 --> 02:04:14,990
the systems of the
relationships of two fighters.

4080
02:04:15,110 --> 02:04:19,640
What changed in such a way because of
his behavior and that's where it gets to

4081
02:04:19,641 --> 02:04:20,840
me really,

4082
02:04:20,841 --> 02:04:21,471
really wild.

4083
02:04:21,471 --> 02:04:25,190
Because right now nobody gets to Stephen
Thompson and I mean nobody really at

4084
02:04:25,191 --> 02:04:25,800
all.

4085
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,830
Well Tyron is knocked him down
twice about him really badly.

4086
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,410
There's 50 minutes,

4087
02:04:30,411 --> 02:04:31,520
50 minutes,

4088
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:32,780
and he had like the fight.

4089
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:34,760
Those are the moments in the
fight where they engaged.

4090
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:36,960
See the problem with those
two Tyron Woodley fights,

4091
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:38,123
Woodley fought

4092
02:04:38,150 --> 02:04:39,510
Wonderboy the right way.

4093
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:40,570
That's how you got to fight them.

4094
02:04:40,571 --> 02:04:41,401
You don't engage.

4095
02:04:41,401 --> 02:04:42,221
And when you do engage,

4096
02:04:42,221 --> 02:04:43,950
you've got to be absolutely
convinced you're going to land.

4097
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:46,440
And Tyron did and did land and hurt them.

4098
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:48,120
I mean you looked at those two fights.

4099
02:04:48,121 --> 02:04:49,650
Tyron is the one who's the wrestler,

4100
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:51,600
but he's also the one that hurt Wonderboy.

4101
02:04:51,601 --> 02:04:52,720
Wonderboy never heard tire.

4102
02:04:52,721 --> 02:04:53,430
And in those fights,

4103
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:54,020
nope.

4104
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:56,090
Tyron had him very close to being now.

4105
02:04:56,460 --> 02:05:01,350
And I just wonder if
Wonderboy is starting to slip.

4106
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:01,891
You know,

4107
02:05:01,891 --> 02:05:02,820
you got to wonder,

4108
02:05:03,030 --> 02:05:05,610
you gotta wonder if all
his years of combat sports,

4109
02:05:05,611 --> 02:05:08,240
all of his years of kickboxing and
you've got to remember this guy,

4110
02:05:08,241 --> 02:05:10,620
he's one of the most spectacular
kickboxing records ever.

4111
02:05:10,750 --> 02:05:10,950
Yeah,

4112
02:05:10,950 --> 02:05:11,131
I mean,

4113
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:15,780
what is it like 57 and oh or something
like that and kickboxing and then he gets

4114
02:05:15,781 --> 02:05:17,310
into MMA and you know,

4115
02:05:17,311 --> 02:05:19,350
he loses to Matt Brown,

4116
02:05:19,351 --> 02:05:21,000
he gets kind of beat up on the ground,

4117
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:22,673
comes back,

4118
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,930
has some really good fights and you know,

4119
02:05:24,931 --> 02:05:27,780
it's been in there with world class
fighters and beaten some world class

4120
02:05:27,781 --> 02:05:28,500
fighters.

4121
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,520
But he's also,

4122
02:05:29,521 --> 02:05:32,060
I want to say he's 34 35 right.

4123
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,610
And that was a lot of fights,

4124
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:37,330
although we didn't get until
recently until those three examples,

4125
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:39,040
he had really get hit all that much.

4126
02:05:39,041 --> 02:05:41,080
But it's still the wearable
tech Stephen Thompson

4127
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:42,410
find out how wonderful it is.

4128
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:44,560
It might even be 35 yep.

4129
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:48,340
The hips and the knees and the
shoulders and that whole five 35.

4130
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:48,730
Yeah.

4131
02:05:48,730 --> 02:05:49,150
Yeah.

4132
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:49,960
Um,

4133
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:50,793
but,

4134
02:05:50,860 --> 02:05:53,050
and there's also that what he,

4135
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:56,260
I mean he developed
mastery in what he does.

4136
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:56,860
Yeah.

4137
02:05:56,860 --> 02:05:59,140
And once you've developed that elite,

4138
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:02,380
elite top level of reached
your highest potential,

4139
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:03,850
it's hard to keep going.

4140
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:09,540
And then the masses start to close that
distance though the general young kid

4141
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:10,360
start,

4142
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:10,571
you know,

4143
02:06:10,571 --> 02:06:11,560
a kid at Tristar,

4144
02:06:11,561 --> 02:06:12,640
like some of their young guys,

4145
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:16,300
they have that and they've had Thompson
in there for years and for us has been

4146
02:06:16,301 --> 02:06:20,260
able to study people like that up
close and they all studied Leo Odo.

4147
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:25,060
Now the young guy can do a lot of those
things at a much higher level than

4148
02:06:25,150 --> 02:06:26,500
fighters that came before them.

4149
02:06:26,501 --> 02:06:28,810
So your level of mastery starts,

4150
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:31,540
you plateau to a point that
it's hard to go beyond.

4151
02:06:31,541 --> 02:06:31,860
It's,

4152
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:35,590
it's really hard work and sometimes it
requires you to get a little shittier for

4153
02:06:35,591 --> 02:06:40,591
a bit too to go past that
plateau to weekend or get
worse by having to reexamine

4154
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:46,000
what you believe and the way that you
train or the way that you fight to break

4155
02:06:46,001 --> 02:06:46,660
through a plateau.

4156
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:49,300
You've got to kind of be
willing to go backwards a bit.

4157
02:06:49,510 --> 02:06:51,580
And when you're fighting
Tyron Woodley's of the world,

4158
02:06:51,581 --> 02:06:52,780
you cannot go backwards.

4159
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:55,000
So it's kind of kind of stalls you there.

4160
02:06:55,001 --> 02:06:55,780
So,

4161
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:58,750
but ultimately the big question also is,

4162
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:02,710
is there some other strategy that
hasn't yet been done that is a Stephen

4163
02:07:02,710 --> 02:07:04,120
Thompson beater and that low leg kick?

4164
02:07:04,121 --> 02:07:06,310
You talked about that mate.

4165
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:07,990
So I cannot get to you.

4166
02:07:08,010 --> 02:07:11,860
So what would I prefer when I'm
fighting Stephen Thompson body lock.

4167
02:07:11,861 --> 02:07:14,530
If I can get to the body lock
cover up and down to get to a body,

4168
02:07:14,531 --> 02:07:15,550
like I got to touch them.

4169
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:16,691
That's really hard.

4170
02:07:16,691 --> 02:07:20,260
He stops me from doing that or
I got to hit him or kick him.

4171
02:07:20,261 --> 02:07:21,011
But when I do that,

4172
02:07:21,011 --> 02:07:22,000
he moves away and hits.

4173
02:07:22,150 --> 02:07:26,160
What if I can just get to the
edge of his sort of bubble of,

4174
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:27,080
of,

4175
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:27,690
of hot,

4176
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:29,710
that hot range where he can hurt you.

4177
02:07:29,890 --> 02:07:31,630
And maybe that low leg
kick is a part of that,

4178
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:32,350
you know,

4179
02:07:32,350 --> 02:07:33,310
maybe that low leg kick,

4180
02:07:33,311 --> 02:07:36,550
just getting on the outside of it
where you're still somewhat safe,

4181
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:38,380
but you can smash him up a little bit.

4182
02:07:38,381 --> 02:07:40,300
Maybe those are a weapon
that hasn't been used.

4183
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:41,110
Well it's,

4184
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:46,110
this is also arguably the best striker
that wonder boys ever faced in MMA,

4185
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:47,700
arguably,

4186
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:48,130
right?

4187
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:50,560
I mean Moskva is very
talented striker as well.

4188
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:51,280
Uh,

4189
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:56,280
but Wonderboy is a master of that front
leg and that front leg is a real tricky

4190
02:07:56,891 --> 02:07:57,340
one.

4191
02:07:57,340 --> 02:07:57,730
Cause the,

4192
02:07:57,730 --> 02:07:59,320
that karate style that he uses,

4193
02:07:59,321 --> 02:08:00,820
he keeps his hands down low.

4194
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:04,750
He stands totally sideways on you and
you got to get past that front leg side

4195
02:08:04,751 --> 02:08:06,430
kick and Johnny couldn't get past it.

4196
02:08:06,431 --> 02:08:08,590
Hendricks got lit up by that front leg,

4197
02:08:08,591 --> 02:08:11,470
side kick and then front roundhouse
kick to the face right afterwards.

4198
02:08:11,471 --> 02:08:12,304
It's just,

4199
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:15,100
there's a lot going on with that
front leg if you're not used to that.

4200
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:15,881
And then if you,

4201
02:08:15,881 --> 02:08:17,260
if he'd get too obsessed with it,

4202
02:08:17,261 --> 02:08:18,320
the back leg comes.

4203
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:19,480
Yeah.

4204
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:22,000
Till is a way better.

4205
02:08:22,650 --> 02:08:24,460
He's a way better master of distance.

4206
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:28,120
He understands distance and strike and
he knows how to close that distance with

4207
02:08:28,121 --> 02:08:29,320
explosive power.

4208
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:30,453
Very interesting.

4209
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:32,490
Cause and before he fought cowboy,

4210
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:37,200
his successes were fighting at
distance and smashing guys who came in.

4211
02:08:37,290 --> 02:08:39,300
So he does do that.

4212
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,520
He does by doing it,

4213
02:08:41,550 --> 02:08:43,410
you understand it on a different level,

4214
02:08:43,411 --> 02:08:44,280
you connect to it.

4215
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:45,810
It is it in a mood tie way.

4216
02:08:45,990 --> 02:08:50,990
Whereas Wonderboy doesn't the cry way
and Wonderboy is fantastic at moving his

4217
02:08:51,001 --> 02:08:54,130
waist back and forth like
a snake and jumped on.

4218
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:55,100
He's really good at that too.

4219
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:55,591
Yes.

4220
02:08:55,591 --> 02:08:57,200
Tony Ferguson's really fucking good.

4221
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:58,110
Yeah.

4222
02:08:58,110 --> 02:08:58,560
Yeah.

4223
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:59,250
And that,

4224
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:01,740
so w when I get to go study,

4225
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:02,390
um,

4226
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:04,360
Sanda and Kung Fu and you,

4227
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:05,550
there are,

4228
02:09:05,550 --> 02:09:06,630
some of my friends are like,

4229
02:09:06,631 --> 02:09:06,781
well,

4230
02:09:06,781 --> 02:09:07,614
you know,

4231
02:09:07,650 --> 02:09:08,461
like enjoy it.

4232
02:09:08,461 --> 02:09:08,701
I'm like,

4233
02:09:08,701 --> 02:09:08,941
Nah,

4234
02:09:08,941 --> 02:09:11,250
this is going to be some
brilliant shit to learn over here.

4235
02:09:11,251 --> 02:09:13,980
This and some of that long fist stuff.

4236
02:09:14,010 --> 02:09:14,970
Like people will often say,

4237
02:09:14,971 --> 02:09:15,101
well,

4238
02:09:15,101 --> 02:09:16,560
Kung Fu is not super relevant.

4239
02:09:16,710 --> 02:09:20,940
Some of that long fist reaching where I
move my body through space to reach you,

4240
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:22,650
which people would say is dangerous,

4241
02:09:22,651 --> 02:09:23,484
you get counted.

4242
02:09:23,650 --> 02:09:25,590
Well I check the answer
is don't get countered.

4243
02:09:25,591 --> 02:09:27,780
The answer isn't discard
a valuable weapons.

4244
02:09:28,290 --> 02:09:29,370
And so you see some of that.

4245
02:09:29,371 --> 02:09:30,900
Tony does that stuff really,

4246
02:09:30,901 --> 02:09:31,261
really,

4247
02:09:31,261 --> 02:09:31,840
really well.

4248
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:32,910
A lot of really cool.

4249
02:09:32,911 --> 02:09:37,911
He does see him work with the wing
Chung cool man wing chunk too.

4250
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:40,950
When I'm sitting in your
guard wanting to beat you up.

4251
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:41,551
Tell me that.

4252
02:09:41,551 --> 02:09:43,080
Isn't wing Chung just were attached.

4253
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:44,063
That's what that is.

4254
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,270
That's what that is,

4255
02:09:45,271 --> 02:09:45,610
right?

4256
02:09:45,610 --> 02:09:45,910
Yeah.

4257
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:50,050
I mean there's techniques in every
single art that are like an established

4258
02:09:50,051 --> 02:09:51,820
realistic art that are valuable.

4259
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:52,451
You know,

4260
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:52,751
and there's,

4261
02:09:52,751 --> 02:09:56,190
there's gotta be something in wing
Chung the people are missing for sure.

4262
02:09:56,220 --> 02:09:57,053
For sure.

4263
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:58,403
Santa,

4264
02:09:58,470 --> 02:10:03,470
I mean art's psych that people would look
at and Mike Discard because they would

4265
02:10:03,961 --> 02:10:06,030
think they're limited
to only this scenario.

4266
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:09,210
Well that scenario happens
if I'm in your garden,

4267
02:10:09,211 --> 02:10:10,044
I want to fight.

4268
02:10:10,170 --> 02:10:10,950
We are,

4269
02:10:10,950 --> 02:10:11,880
that's that scenario.

4270
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:14,610
So that thing may not be useful to fight,

4271
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:15,803
you know,

4272
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:16,673
Frank Mir.

4273
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:19,390
But that thing will be useful in
a context when you're fighting.

4274
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:19,841
Well,

4275
02:10:19,841 --> 02:10:21,070
how about Jon Jones?

4276
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:25,960
His use of you grab his wrist and he comes
over the top of an elbow that is hand

4277
02:10:25,961 --> 02:10:26,520
tramping.

4278
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:26,680
Yeah,

4279
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:27,160
for sure.

4280
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,630
I mean it really wasn't is what it is.

4281
02:10:29,350 --> 02:10:30,310
Leverage a Sherif.

4282
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:30,850
Oh Yeah,

4283
02:10:30,850 --> 02:10:31,550
limb distraction.

4284
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:31,930
Yup.

4285
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:32,710
That's old school.

4286
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:33,170
The structure.

4287
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:33,620
Yeah.

4288
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:34,040
How and

4289
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:37,040
why that hasn't been
rabid hauled a lot more,

4290
02:10:37,070 --> 02:10:40,770
although he's do start to see
that and that moment where were,

4291
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:41,540
you know,

4292
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:42,620
I get to all four,

4293
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:45,680
I get to four points that I'm going to
stand up and you just kind of decide,

4294
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:46,011
okay.

4295
02:10:46,011 --> 02:10:46,491
That's all right.

4296
02:10:46,491 --> 02:10:49,400
We'll get back to the fence in
that process of standing up,

4297
02:10:49,401 --> 02:10:50,900
a lot of guys throw a fight,

4298
02:10:50,901 --> 02:10:55,250
finishing kick there or just at least
take that chance to smash your leg with

4299
02:10:55,251 --> 02:10:55,491
one.

4300
02:10:55,491 --> 02:11:00,140
Like there's free shots that exist in
these moments and Jon Jones is a master of

4301
02:11:00,141 --> 02:11:00,950
finding them.

4302
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:01,783
He really is.

4303
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:02,300
Yeah.

4304
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:05,690
I hope they figure out what the fuck
they're going to do with him soon.

4305
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:10,691
I don't know where they stand now in
terms of like his suspension or what have

4306
02:11:11,151 --> 02:11:11,361
you,

4307
02:11:11,361 --> 02:11:13,700
but here's my ultimate goal,

4308
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:14,593
my hope,

4309
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:17,480
my dream is that core me a fight,

4310
02:11:17,481 --> 02:11:22,481
Steve Bay for the heavyweight title and
somewhere around then they announce when

4311
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:23,741
Jon Jones,

4312
02:11:23,741 --> 02:11:24,830
the suspension is up,

4313
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:27,250
they announced John Jones
versus Brock Lesnar.

4314
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:29,060
Love it.

4315
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:30,080
I love it.

4316
02:11:30,081 --> 02:11:30,770
I just,

4317
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:34,220
I mean look at their body types and
look at what they are and where did they

4318
02:11:34,221 --> 02:11:34,701
come from.

4319
02:11:34,701 --> 02:11:34,941
I mean,

4320
02:11:34,941 --> 02:11:36,050
I love it,

4321
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:39,530
but I know you've sat down
with John and and stuff,

4322
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:41,360
but what did you like,

4323
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:43,910
what did he feel like you
do you know what I mean?

4324
02:11:43,911 --> 02:11:44,744
Like what,

4325
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:47,090
what Reed did you get from him?

4326
02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:51,530
Did you feel like he was saying the things
that he thought you wanted to hear or

4327
02:11:51,531 --> 02:11:53,810
did you feel he was
being honest and genuine?

4328
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:54,763
Definitely both.

4329
02:11:54,770 --> 02:11:55,730
Easy and honest.

4330
02:11:55,731 --> 02:11:57,950
And he's also had some
things that he planned out.

4331
02:11:58,370 --> 02:11:59,420
I like John a lot.

4332
02:11:59,450 --> 02:12:00,440
I really love that guy,

4333
02:12:00,830 --> 02:12:03,260
but I think he surrounds himself
with a bunch of knuckleheads.

4334
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:04,513
I think he's,

4335
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:07,490
he's around too many people
that are a bad influence.

4336
02:12:07,491 --> 02:12:09,080
And I think he's,

4337
02:12:09,081 --> 02:12:10,310
he's a wild man.

4338
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:14,660
And I think when he's a wild man around
other people that are sort of indulging

4339
02:12:14,661 --> 02:12:15,530
that stuff with them,

4340
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,820
this is the word that I get,

4341
02:12:16,821 --> 02:12:18,710
not just from what I know,

4342
02:12:18,711 --> 02:12:22,550
but from the people that know him very
well is that he's just around the wrong

4343
02:12:22,551 --> 02:12:23,180
people.

4344
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:23,421
You know,

4345
02:12:23,421 --> 02:12:24,800
he's got bad influences.

4346
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:26,173
I mean,

4347
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:28,400
if you can identify that,

4348
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:29,630
then you must change it.

4349
02:12:29,631 --> 02:12:30,171
Yet it's not,

4350
02:12:30,171 --> 02:12:32,960
it's not to take any personal
responsibility away from him either,

4351
02:12:32,961 --> 02:12:37,640
because I'm sure he also makes
for a bad influence to them.

4352
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:37,921
Right.

4353
02:12:37,921 --> 02:12:38,081
I mean,

4354
02:12:38,081 --> 02:12:38,150
I'm,

4355
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:40,700
the fucking baddest man on
the planet can live like this.

4356
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:41,910
I'll live like this to fuck it.

4357
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:44,750
Let's do more coke and know
it's what's party harder.

4358
02:12:44,751 --> 02:12:45,530
Let's drive fast.

4359
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:46,363
Let's go drunk.

4360
02:12:46,670 --> 02:12:47,000
Um,

4361
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:47,980
I don't know.

4362
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:48,320
You know,

4363
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:49,400
I don't know what the answer is.

4364
02:12:49,401 --> 02:12:49,620
We're,

4365
02:12:49,620 --> 02:12:51,020
we're a guy like John,

4366
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:51,321
you know,

4367
02:12:51,321 --> 02:12:52,250
I really don't know.

4368
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:52,551
I mean,

4369
02:12:52,551 --> 02:12:53,384
it's a,

4370
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:55,610
it's got to have that
come to Jesus moment.

4371
02:12:55,611 --> 02:12:56,210
Yeah.

4372
02:12:56,210 --> 02:12:57,043
Or not.

4373
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:57,441
You know,

4374
02:12:57,441 --> 02:13:01,370
maybe he just keeps doing what he's doing
and keeps beating everybody's ass and

4375
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:04,700
people keep forgiving them and
hopefully it doesn't wind up in jail.

4376
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:07,820
But he should for sure
get a driver for sure.

4377
02:13:07,821 --> 02:13:09,260
Get someone to fucking drive him around.

4378
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:09,800
That's a bad,

4379
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:10,790
that's a good bandaid.

4380
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:11,601
But it's not going to be,

4381
02:13:11,601 --> 02:13:12,860
that's not the problem solver.

4382
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:14,120
The truth is I think,

4383
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:18,590
I mean we get to live
the life that we want.

4384
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,900
Like we get to choose
the things that we do.

4385
02:13:20,901 --> 02:13:23,690
Like we have free to a certain
extent to a certain extent.

4386
02:13:23,691 --> 02:13:26,000
I know freewill is something
that's been deceived,

4387
02:13:26,001 --> 02:13:26,801
discussed and it's,

4388
02:13:26,801 --> 02:13:28,010
it's a fascinating concept,

4389
02:13:28,190 --> 02:13:29,420
but to some degree,

4390
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:30,111
you know,

4391
02:13:30,111 --> 02:13:32,070
we are offering own lives,

4392
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,581
you know,

4393
02:13:32,581 --> 02:13:32,731
and,

4394
02:13:32,731 --> 02:13:34,950
and if it isn't going
the way that you want it,

4395
02:13:35,470 --> 02:13:38,430
small tiny changes can
push it a different way.

4396
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:39,433
Yeah.

4397
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:42,050
It's a matter of whether or not
he's willing to make those changes.

4398
02:13:42,051 --> 02:13:42,830
And you know,

4399
02:13:42,830 --> 02:13:45,800
right now I'm sure he just
wants to get his license back,

4400
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:47,060
you know?

4401
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:51,110
But like when I see him like having
these battles back and forth with chuck

4402
02:13:51,111 --> 02:13:52,160
Ladell Online,

4403
02:13:52,161 --> 02:13:54,650
like you got a bark away from that.

4404
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:56,030
Like Chuck Odell,

4405
02:13:56,031 --> 02:14:00,260
some old warrior who is clearly
taking too many shots like,

4406
02:14:00,350 --> 02:14:02,120
and you know the s you know,

4407
02:14:02,121 --> 02:14:07,121
calling him an old man and saying all
this stuff and it's like just be the

4408
02:14:07,251 --> 02:14:08,900
better man in this situation.

4409
02:14:08,901 --> 02:14:09,121
You're,

4410
02:14:09,121 --> 02:14:12,230
you're the top of the heap right
now at the top of your game.

4411
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:17,560
You don't want some young guy doing this
to you 15 years from now talking to you

4412
02:14:17,721 --> 02:14:18,261
that way.

4413
02:14:18,261 --> 02:14:18,501
I mean,

4414
02:14:18,501 --> 02:14:19,050
this is the,

4415
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:20,600
these are the dark days,

4416
02:14:21,170 --> 02:14:22,850
but when we turn the TV on,

4417
02:14:22,970 --> 02:14:26,150
I don't care if you watch CNN
or Fox or CNBC or whatever,

4418
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:30,740
or the NFL or hockey or
fighting or whatever.

4419
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:34,640
A lot of what we see is a bunch of
heads who somebody has said you choose

4420
02:14:34,641 --> 02:14:37,010
different sides or they know
that's what they should do.

4421
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:39,200
And then they just argue and we watch it.

4422
02:14:39,230 --> 02:14:39,860
We're taught it,

4423
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:41,150
we see it every single day,

4424
02:14:41,210 --> 02:14:42,043
all the time.

4425
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:42,841
You crazy.

4426
02:14:42,841 --> 02:14:46,980
It drives me crazy and transmits
to fighting the sports guy talk.

4427
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:47,990
Yeah,

4428
02:14:47,990 --> 02:14:51,840
that drives me nuts when it comes to
fighting because they have this sort of

4429
02:14:51,841 --> 02:14:56,841
robotic predetermined pattern of
behavior that they apply to football and

4430
02:14:58,291 --> 02:15:03,291
baseball and I just feel like
fighting is just more personal,

4431
02:15:03,391 --> 02:15:05,790
more intimate is there's more on the line,

4432
02:15:05,791 --> 02:15:06,780
there's more at stake.

4433
02:15:06,781 --> 02:15:11,781
It means more to me and when I see that
dopey sports guide jock talk applied to

4434
02:15:12,421 --> 02:15:12,871
fighting,

4435
02:15:12,871 --> 02:15:13,740
it makes me angry.

4436
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,060
It makes me angry too,

4437
02:15:15,090 --> 02:15:17,550
but for different reasons as well.

4438
02:15:17,551 --> 02:15:19,440
One is this,

4439
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:23,970
this doesn't apply exactly as you said
and the other one is the city of apply to

4440
02:15:23,971 --> 02:15:26,490
football or anything
because it's ritualistic,

4441
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:29,340
like it acts as if this
show doesn't exist.

4442
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:31,080
The reason it looks,

4443
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:34,380
so we were talking about how things
meanings change once upon a time.

4444
02:15:34,381 --> 02:15:35,760
That was a professional speaker.

4445
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:38,130
Now that is a rehearsed over,

4446
02:15:38,131 --> 02:15:38,970
strategized,

4447
02:15:38,971 --> 02:15:42,810
constructed artificial speaker and in a
world where someone watches the fucking

4448
02:15:42,811 --> 02:15:47,190
Joe Rogan podcast or goes on and sees
Dwayne training guys or watches a

4449
02:15:47,191 --> 02:15:50,670
supermodel on Instagram or
sees what the rock is cooking.

4450
02:15:50,671 --> 02:15:51,504
Like I said,

4451
02:15:51,810 --> 02:15:53,520
we see real people everywhere.

4452
02:15:53,521 --> 02:15:57,600
So now this becomes
ritualistic and artificial.

4453
02:15:57,710 --> 02:16:00,620
It's a strip club Dj to hey
come into the top stage.

4454
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:05,120
It's like that pre determined
sort of pattern of behavior.

4455
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:08,150
The they adopt this pattern and you know,

4456
02:16:08,151 --> 02:16:12,200
there's a lot of people that adopt that
sports guy pattern and there's a lot of

4457
02:16:12,201 --> 02:16:13,940
shitty writers that do it too.

4458
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:19,460
And they apply that insulting
style of writing to combat sports.

4459
02:16:19,461 --> 02:16:23,680
And some of them have never been inside
a cage and most in life and apparently

4460
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:24,573
even trained.

4461
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:24,980
Yeah,

4462
02:16:24,980 --> 02:16:25,361
no it,

4463
02:16:25,361 --> 02:16:25,551
it,

4464
02:16:25,551 --> 02:16:26,384
it's,

4465
02:16:26,450 --> 02:16:27,283
if you,

4466
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:30,040
if you have not been kicked

4467
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:31,690
in the fucking head in
front of your mother,

4468
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:33,800
you have no right to criticize.

4469
02:16:33,810 --> 02:16:35,120
Never saw me fight my mom.

4470
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:37,200
I fucking got got God.

4471
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:38,663
I got,

4472
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:39,940
I wouldn't want that pressure.

4473
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:44,080
A couple of punches happening and I
get caught in the guillotine and I'm

4474
02:16:44,081 --> 02:16:47,350
thinking I'm okay and I'm driving my
shoulder in and then I start to go out and

4475
02:16:47,351 --> 02:16:47,801
I'm just,

4476
02:16:47,801 --> 02:16:51,760
and I kind of hit him in the eye tap and
I look up and my mom is right fucking

4477
02:16:51,761 --> 02:16:52,330
there.

4478
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:53,200
She's right there.

4479
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:55,510
And my mom.

4480
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:56,710
My family is wonderful,

4481
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:57,071
right?

4482
02:16:57,071 --> 02:17:01,450
Like I got the best wife that the humans
have ever had in my parents and her

4483
02:17:01,451 --> 02:17:01,970
parents.

4484
02:17:01,970 --> 02:17:06,790
I'm surrounded by great people and I
know that my mother literally was looking

4485
02:17:06,791 --> 02:17:07,624
at me like,

4486
02:17:07,630 --> 02:17:08,590
I'm proud of you.

4487
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:09,610
You know,

4488
02:17:09,610 --> 02:17:10,241
don't worry,

4489
02:17:10,241 --> 02:17:10,930
this happens,

4490
02:17:10,930 --> 02:17:12,400
but my memory has are going

4491
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:15,250
well.

4492
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:16,480
She's probably just sad.

4493
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:17,230
Yeah,

4494
02:17:17,230 --> 02:17:17,501
sure.

4495
02:17:17,501 --> 02:17:18,370
She's going to shake her head.

4496
02:17:18,371 --> 02:17:19,204
Yes,

4497
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:19,601
it was.

4498
02:17:19,601 --> 02:17:19,991
Yeah,

4499
02:17:19,991 --> 02:17:21,850
but I mean if you haven't been to that,

4500
02:17:21,851 --> 02:17:23,380
if you haven't experienced failure,

4501
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:27,550
if you haven't been carried
out on a stretcher as
everybody booze you or it felt

4502
02:17:27,551 --> 02:17:29,080
victory or been terrified,

4503
02:17:29,290 --> 02:17:34,290
you cannot logically criticized them
because you don't understand the thing.

4504
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:37,600
If you haven't done it,

4505
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:39,310
if you have some respect for it,

4506
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:40,153
I'll respect you.

4507
02:17:40,230 --> 02:17:42,420
Just just understand what
they're going through like you.

4508
02:17:42,421 --> 02:17:44,950
I don't think you necessarily have
to have gone to war to be a war

4509
02:17:44,951 --> 02:17:45,784
correspondent,

4510
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:46,990
to understand it,

4511
02:17:46,991 --> 02:17:47,741
to talk about it.

4512
02:17:47,741 --> 02:17:51,730
You don't have to have shot someone to
be able to understand what people are

4513
02:17:51,731 --> 02:17:54,670
going through or at least
try to comprehend it,

4514
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:56,210
but have some respect about it.

4515
02:17:56,260 --> 02:18:00,610
There's a way to criticize technique
and movement without being insulting.

4516
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:03,100
And I think this is a part
of the problem with this.

4517
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:06,220
The sports guy attitude
isn't insulting attitude.

4518
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:07,600
It's a judgmental one.

4519
02:18:07,601 --> 02:18:07,790
Yeah.

4520
02:18:07,790 --> 02:18:12,650
It's judgmental and mocking and I
think they played a Johnny lunchbox.

4521
02:18:12,670 --> 02:18:17,530
I think they play to dumb dumbs and I
just that it really hurts my feelings when

4522
02:18:17,531 --> 02:18:21,760
I see that sort of strategy applied
to covering mixed martial arts.

4523
02:18:21,870 --> 02:18:22,210
Yeah.

4524
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:23,410
And like I said,

4525
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:28,560
it acts as if as less and less
people consume this older but valid,

4526
02:18:31,380 --> 02:18:31,920
um,

4527
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:32,200
uh,

4528
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:37,200
interface television less and less and
more and more are consuming other things

4529
02:18:37,631 --> 02:18:39,120
that are different and new and,

4530
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:39,970
and stuff.

4531
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:43,000
It's bizarre that the
old one starts to say,

4532
02:18:43,001 --> 02:18:43,151
yeah,

4533
02:18:43,151 --> 02:18:44,290
well we still do it this way.

4534
02:18:44,490 --> 02:18:44,680
Right.

4535
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:48,850
You can't do it that way because people
now it looks weird and old now it looks,

4536
02:18:49,090 --> 02:18:53,320
it's context has changed
because we have seen thousands,

4537
02:18:53,330 --> 02:18:57,340
we've seen what Michael Chandler eight
today and how he helped his son and this

4538
02:18:57,341 --> 02:18:57,941
guy is saying,

4539
02:18:57,941 --> 02:18:58,181
well,

4540
02:18:58,181 --> 02:18:58,990
you know,

4541
02:18:58,990 --> 02:19:00,580
a striker versus grappler like,

4542
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:02,530
and it's just,

4543
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:03,370
you haven't evolved.

4544
02:19:03,370 --> 02:19:03,610
They,

4545
02:19:03,610 --> 02:19:03,860
yeah,

4546
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:08,170
you have to step in and
this applies to us all.

4547
02:19:08,290 --> 02:19:11,770
You have to reset up and look at where
you are and what it's meaning is and

4548
02:19:11,771 --> 02:19:12,250
realize,

4549
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:12,640
oh,

4550
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:13,151
technology,

4551
02:19:13,151 --> 02:19:15,280
change the audience change
the world changed my life,

4552
02:19:15,281 --> 02:19:17,170
changed the economy,

4553
02:19:17,171 --> 02:19:18,004
changed the market.

4554
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:19,240
All of these things have changed.

4555
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:20,320
I'm still the same.

4556
02:19:20,470 --> 02:19:20,920
I met,

4557
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:21,850
I'm a dinosaur.

4558
02:19:21,851 --> 02:19:22,571
That doesn't make sense.

4559
02:19:22,571 --> 02:19:23,261
I can't do that.

4560
02:19:23,261 --> 02:19:24,094
I must change.

4561
02:19:24,190 --> 02:19:24,610
Right?

4562
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:26,410
But the reason sports,

4563
02:19:26,411 --> 02:19:27,140
television,

4564
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:28,040
the NFL or

4565
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,970
many of these things,

4566
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:33,020
news doesn't is it starts out
that there are innovators.

4567
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:38,140
So in fighting it was Dana White and
the fatigue does and you guys and vital

4568
02:19:38,361 --> 02:19:43,361
young innovative creators and then as
it grows you need organized thinkers.

4569
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:48,920
You need people who can organize and
structure something so that it can grow.

4570
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:52,400
The problem is they get really good at
structuring hierarchies that get really

4571
02:19:52,401 --> 02:19:56,690
good at structuring business in such a
way that they are then in charge and then

4572
02:19:56,691 --> 02:19:57,411
when it changes,

4573
02:19:57,411 --> 02:19:58,760
you need those creatives again.

4574
02:19:59,030 --> 02:19:59,570
But the,

4575
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:03,830
but these structure guys are there and
they've built these formulas that they

4576
02:20:03,831 --> 02:20:05,510
are then bound by where it's like,

4577
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:05,811
well,

4578
02:20:05,811 --> 02:20:08,210
of course we're going starting with the
opening shot and then we're going to go,

4579
02:20:08,211 --> 02:20:09,500
we're right here in Brazil,

4580
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:10,880
shot of the Christ,

4581
02:20:10,881 --> 02:20:11,571
the redeemer,

4582
02:20:11,571 --> 02:20:13,060
and then we'll go and here we've got a,

4583
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:14,600
oh it's so unbelievable.

4584
02:20:14,601 --> 02:20:16,220
Matchup with the winner gets a title shot.

4585
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,300
Those are rituals.

4586
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:21,560
It was a bizarre formulaic rituals
created when they mattered and there were

4587
02:20:21,561 --> 02:20:24,500
valuable by highly
intelligent people that,

4588
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:27,380
that were required to make this work.

4589
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:28,790
But now you need different people,

4590
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:29,840
you need a different thought,

4591
02:20:29,841 --> 02:20:30,261
you need crew,

4592
02:20:30,261 --> 02:20:32,960
the creatives back in and
they usually don't want that.

4593
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:34,201
Yeah.

4594
02:20:34,201 --> 02:20:34,641
I think,

4595
02:20:34,641 --> 02:20:34,860
uh,

4596
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:39,860
I like your point about
different approaches and I
think one of the best ways to

4597
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:44,820
maybe perhaps have a different approach
is to have more intense coverage of

4598
02:20:44,821 --> 02:20:45,750
training footage.

4599
02:20:45,940 --> 02:20:46,291
You know,

4600
02:20:46,291 --> 02:20:49,680
and I think they're doing that with the
embedded series of those online things.

4601
02:20:49,681 --> 02:20:51,360
I'd like more people to check those out.

4602
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:55,620
I think if more people got
an understanding of how
much is involved in this,

4603
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:57,900
like when people get injured
and pull out a fight,

4604
02:20:57,901 --> 02:21:01,290
it's like some people will freak out
and complain and write a bunch of stupid

4605
02:21:01,291 --> 02:21:01,531
shit.

4606
02:21:01,531 --> 02:21:03,540
Like I don't know what
happened to Mirko Cro cop,

4607
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:06,090
but you can't say anything bad about him,

4608
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:07,620
but he's a superhero.

4609
02:21:07,621 --> 02:21:07,891
The Guy,

4610
02:21:07,891 --> 02:21:09,420
if that guy pulls out of a fight,

4611
02:21:09,421 --> 02:21:09,871
you've got to go.

4612
02:21:09,871 --> 02:21:10,081
Well,

4613
02:21:10,081 --> 02:21:14,280
he obviously must be too hurt to
fight and this is part of the game,

4614
02:21:14,610 --> 02:21:14,971
you know?

4615
02:21:14,971 --> 02:21:15,240
I mean,

4616
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:19,020
but I've read some ridiculous shit that
people have said about Mirko online.

4617
02:21:19,021 --> 02:21:21,480
Like I went to Canelo's
page the other day.

4618
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:22,740
Oh my God,

4619
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:25,230
there's pictures of Canelo
Alvarez and people are,

4620
02:21:25,231 --> 02:21:25,500
you know,

4621
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:26,880
judging his body and saying,

4622
02:21:26,881 --> 02:21:27,990
it looks tiny now.

4623
02:21:27,991 --> 02:21:28,390
And,

4624
02:21:28,390 --> 02:21:33,390
and there's all these emojis of pills
and needles all throughout his entire

4625
02:21:35,150 --> 02:21:36,190
Instagram posts.

4626
02:21:36,191 --> 02:21:36,811
There's fucking,

4627
02:21:36,811 --> 02:21:38,430
the comments are ruthless.

4628
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:41,270
Just ruthlessly fucking insult.

4629
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:42,040
Dang.

4630
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:42,290
I mean,

4631
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:44,210
this is just the world we live in.

4632
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:47,960
I did a breakdown on
Vito and like you know,

4633
02:21:47,961 --> 02:21:51,250
he'd go in and then Instagram is the law,

4634
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:54,770
at least in my experience is the
least negative cause it's the newest.

4635
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,810
What's the most top negatively youtube.

4636
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:57,300
I agree.

4637
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:58,010
Yeah,

4638
02:21:58,010 --> 02:21:59,210
because it's the oldest,

4639
02:21:59,270 --> 02:21:59,780
right?

4640
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:03,050
It's the oldest because
as things get older,

4641
02:22:03,380 --> 02:22:06,560
a lot of negativity is around and
positive people leave positive.

4642
02:22:06,561 --> 02:22:11,030
People leave because they go on there
on the early part of the technological

4643
02:22:11,570 --> 02:22:12,770
adoption life cycle,

4644
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:16,730
positive people are innovators and early
adopters and they go onto the newer

4645
02:22:16,731 --> 02:22:20,300
thing and then you leave behind the
people who are negative and made the whole

4646
02:22:20,301 --> 02:22:22,460
place go septic and then that
is argue with each other.

4647
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:24,550
I wonder if that's the case I want,

4648
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:26,070
I've never figured out

4649
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,140
what is wrong with youtube comments,

4650
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:33,440
but there are so ruthless like whenever
I have a liberal woman on in particular

4651
02:22:35,350 --> 02:22:38,740
who you have on with an open mind and
are interested in their perspective.

4652
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:41,840
Some of them are my friends like
Abby Martin when when she's on,

4653
02:22:42,110 --> 02:22:45,260
I don't even fucking touch those Commons
or Whitney Whitney Cummings is on.

4654
02:22:45,261 --> 02:22:47,450
I don't mean I don't look
at the comments period,

4655
02:22:47,630 --> 02:22:48,081
period,

4656
02:22:48,081 --> 02:22:48,914
but if I did,

4657
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:51,680
those would be the last ones that I
would look because Dave looked at them

4658
02:22:51,681 --> 02:22:53,780
before and like Whitney
contracts in me and she's like,

4659
02:22:53,781 --> 02:22:54,000
what?

4660
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:54,833
And the fuck.

4661
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:55,770
And I was like,

4662
02:22:55,770 --> 02:22:57,300
don't read that shit.

4663
02:22:57,301 --> 02:22:58,860
It's like don't taste the poison.

4664
02:22:58,870 --> 02:22:59,330
Yeah.

4665
02:22:59,330 --> 02:23:00,163
If the,

4666
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:02,250
wherever the positive people are,

4667
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:03,990
if you're going to spend time.

4668
02:23:03,991 --> 02:23:04,830
And I like too,

4669
02:23:04,831 --> 02:23:08,970
because if 50,000 people
watched me do a breakdown,

4670
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:10,620
that means a lot to me.

4671
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:11,040
Yeah.

4672
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:13,100
And if 60 of them commented,

4673
02:23:13,170 --> 02:23:13,680
I'm gonna.

4674
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:15,990
If I can schedule on the day 45 minutes,

4675
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:18,360
I'm going to take the time and
thank as many of them as I can,

4676
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:20,910
but only where the good way only
where the positive ones are.

4677
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:23,810
Not that I want to be reinforced
that what I'm doing right.

4678
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:28,350
I'm not going to spend the time on people
who are going through life so negative

4679
02:23:28,470 --> 02:23:29,840
that I can't get through to them anyways.

4680
02:23:29,870 --> 02:23:30,060
Right.

4681
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:33,810
Somebody who's going through life looking
for something and trying to to either

4682
02:23:33,811 --> 02:23:36,780
be inspired or learn
something or by positive,

4683
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:38,940
those are the people that
you should spend time with.

4684
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:43,170
And it's also like the reverse of giving
candy to your kid when they're bad.

4685
02:23:43,171 --> 02:23:43,421
Yeah.

4686
02:23:43,421 --> 02:23:46,080
It's like don't go give those
people candy when they're negative.

4687
02:23:46,081 --> 02:23:48,000
If you want them to get away from that,

4688
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:49,500
you want their lives to get better,

4689
02:23:49,501 --> 02:23:52,020
which it will if they
stop having that behavior.

4690
02:23:52,410 --> 02:23:53,190
Yeah.

4691
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:54,800
Maybe of

4692
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:56,110
from are just so broken.

4693
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:56,530
They,

4694
02:23:56,530 --> 02:23:59,470
it's just like their structure is so poor.

4695
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:03,820
The structure of their thinking is so
poor and you know all a lot of them are

4696
02:24:03,821 --> 02:24:07,090
like shut-ins and does a lot of people
with mental illness that are just

4697
02:24:07,091 --> 02:24:08,290
constantly commenting.

4698
02:24:08,291 --> 02:24:08,770
Yeah.

4699
02:24:08,770 --> 02:24:12,280
I mean and then there's the
argument to like kill the comments,

4700
02:24:12,281 --> 02:24:14,440
but then people get furious at you.

4701
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:18,820
We had an issue for a while and it was
an accidental issue and the issue was

4702
02:24:18,970 --> 02:24:19,990
during the stream,

4703
02:24:20,110 --> 02:24:24,190
we don't allow the live chat because it
was always like con to your mother's a

4704
02:24:24,210 --> 02:24:28,630
con like Horse Shit because people
would just try to get attention.

4705
02:24:28,631 --> 02:24:32,440
If we read that stream while
we were doing the show,

4706
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:35,620
the show would be inexorably altered,

4707
02:24:35,860 --> 02:24:36,693
you know,

4708
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:37,181
you'd,

4709
02:24:37,181 --> 02:24:38,640
you'd be altered by like what,

4710
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:39,190
what,

4711
02:24:39,190 --> 02:24:40,000
what are you saying?

4712
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:40,780
Don't say that.

4713
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:42,880
Like you would read it and
then that would be the show.

4714
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,440
The show would be these
people as well as you.

4715
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:45,941
Well,

4716
02:24:45,941 --> 02:24:50,920
it's just not necessary or
valuable because of the fact
that we had the comments

4717
02:24:50,921 --> 02:24:53,110
killed during the live feed.

4718
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:53,830
You couldn't,

4719
02:24:53,830 --> 02:24:57,550
you couldn't chat during the live
feed when we would transfer it over to

4720
02:24:57,551 --> 02:24:58,384
youtube.

4721
02:24:58,710 --> 02:24:59,260
Um,

4722
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:02,710
the comments would be disabled
and people went crazy and the,

4723
02:25:02,730 --> 02:25:03,700
and I had a tweet about it,

4724
02:25:03,701 --> 02:25:04,091
but look,

4725
02:25:04,091 --> 02:25:05,560
I'm not disabling the comments.

4726
02:25:05,561 --> 02:25:07,570
I don't know what this glitches,

4727
02:25:07,571 --> 02:25:08,530
but they're gonna figure it out.

4728
02:25:09,250 --> 02:25:14,250
But Shab decided to disable his comments
on purpose and do they fucking went

4729
02:25:15,701 --> 02:25:17,680
crazy and they were attacking him,

4730
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:21,580
but what are the numbers that give a shit?

4731
02:25:21,581 --> 02:25:22,060
Like who,

4732
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:23,920
have you ever commented a youtube video?

4733
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:24,040
Have

4734
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,990
you ever watched a youtube
video and commented about it?

4735
02:25:25,991 --> 02:25:27,040
I don't think I ever have.

4736
02:25:27,070 --> 02:25:27,903
I never have either.

4737
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:30,170
I don't know anybody worth
a fuck that has that.

4738
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:33,880
That's part of the problem is like I know
there's some really positive comments

4739
02:25:33,881 --> 02:25:37,660
and people who were healthy people were
just interested in debate and discussion

4740
02:25:37,661 --> 02:25:39,340
about particular topics,

4741
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:41,980
but when you're dealing with
all these negative people,

4742
02:25:41,981 --> 02:25:43,060
like what are the numbers?

4743
02:25:43,150 --> 02:25:46,240
If you have a million people
watching a youtube video,

4744
02:25:46,290 --> 02:25:47,850
are we talking about a
hundred people there?

4745
02:25:48,850 --> 02:25:52,360
Is it even if I don't even think it's
the south 200 it might not even be a

4746
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:54,190
hundred you might be
dealing with like 30 cunts,

4747
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:55,210
you know what I mean?

4748
02:25:55,210 --> 02:25:57,940
And they're the ones who are going to
be mad that you disable the comments.

4749
02:25:57,941 --> 02:25:59,740
But does that really matter?

4750
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,311
And it is.

4751
02:26:00,311 --> 02:26:01,510
This is keeping that,

4752
02:26:01,570 --> 02:26:03,490
that cesspool open,

4753
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:07,960
keeping that commode open for them to
dump their fucking verbal diarrhea into.

4754
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:10,600
Is that really feeding the bay?

4755
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:12,940
Is that giving the kid
candy for being an asshole?

4756
02:26:12,970 --> 02:26:13,600
Is it the same?

4757
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:14,160
Maybe.

4758
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,030
Maybe I went,

4759
02:26:15,031 --> 02:26:15,864
saw you,

4760
02:26:16,210 --> 02:26:16,680
uh,

4761
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:20,940
stand and talk to 600 people
who came to your shell.

4762
02:26:21,210 --> 02:26:23,160
You had an in depth conversation,

4763
02:26:23,161 --> 02:26:23,911
chem trails,

4764
02:26:23,911 --> 02:26:27,660
this and fucking fighting that
with each of them in the eye.

4765
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:31,890
You spent for sure four hours when you
took a bunch of friends out for dinner

4766
02:26:31,891 --> 02:26:32,521
and invited me,

4767
02:26:32,521 --> 02:26:33,360
which was really cool.

4768
02:26:33,420 --> 02:26:33,990
Anyway,

4769
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:34,381
thank you.

4770
02:26:34,381 --> 02:26:35,041
I Brag about it,

4771
02:26:35,041 --> 02:26:35,760
all of that.

4772
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:36,061
Uh,

4773
02:26:36,061 --> 02:26:37,740
and then I saw you walk across.

4774
02:26:37,770 --> 02:26:39,240
That was four hours for sure.

4775
02:26:39,930 --> 02:26:40,500
Okay.

4776
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:41,520
Two to four hours.

4777
02:26:41,521 --> 02:26:42,510
I don't know the exact number.

4778
02:26:42,750 --> 02:26:46,560
Then I see you walk across the casino
and in that time you do it again for

4779
02:26:46,561 --> 02:26:48,640
another half hour as you know,

4780
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:49,493
Joey Diaz.

4781
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:50,670
Oh.

4782
02:26:50,671 --> 02:26:50,961
You know,

4783
02:26:50,961 --> 02:26:51,600
like,

4784
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:55,020
and then we sit down and somebody comes
over as soon as you sit down and they

4785
02:26:55,021 --> 02:26:55,171
say,

4786
02:26:55,171 --> 02:26:55,291
Hey,

4787
02:26:55,291 --> 02:26:55,561
can I get,

4788
02:26:55,561 --> 02:26:55,920
and you'd go,

4789
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:56,581
fuck off man,

4790
02:26:56,581 --> 02:26:57,390
I'm meeting.

4791
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:58,890
That's the guy who will tell the world,

4792
02:26:58,891 --> 02:26:59,940
Joe Rogan's and Asshole,

4793
02:27:00,270 --> 02:27:03,690
that guy say fuck off whenever.

4794
02:27:03,710 --> 02:27:04,160
Yeah,

4795
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:04,440
I can't,

4796
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:09,440
you can't just stop your meal every time
someone comes over 800 inter like human

4797
02:27:10,801 --> 02:27:11,970
deep interactions,

4798
02:27:11,971 --> 02:27:13,260
meaningful interactions,

4799
02:27:13,261 --> 02:27:14,790
that one can fuck off.

4800
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:15,041
Well,

4801
02:27:15,041 --> 02:27:16,210
I don't want to say fuck off.

4802
02:27:16,211 --> 02:27:21,211
I just think that people
have this distorted idea of
space that they should just

4803
02:27:21,971 --> 02:27:24,910
be able to invade your space where
you literally have a mouthful of food.

4804
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:25,571
And I mean,

4805
02:27:25,571 --> 02:27:26,380
I've had it happen.

4806
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:26,651
I've had,

4807
02:27:26,651 --> 02:27:28,180
it happened when I was
feeding my daughter,

4808
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:29,081
have her in my lap.

4809
02:27:29,081 --> 02:27:31,930
He'll be a cog in a selfie
and you definitely can't
get a selfie right now while

4810
02:27:31,931 --> 02:27:32,741
I'm feeding my daughter.

4811
02:27:32,741 --> 02:27:33,700
Get the fuck Outta here,

4812
02:27:33,701 --> 02:27:34,130
man.

4813
02:27:34,130 --> 02:27:36,050
That's just a misunderstanding of,

4814
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:37,173
of space.

4815
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:37,640
Yeah.

4816
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:38,473
And

4817
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:41,720
there it is a strange thing.

4818
02:27:41,721 --> 02:27:42,260
I mean,

4819
02:27:42,260 --> 02:27:44,210
I didn't watch my wife,

4820
02:27:44,470 --> 02:27:44,720
uh,

4821
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:46,400
was asking me because I was in Singapore.

4822
02:27:46,430 --> 02:27:47,330
If I watched the,

4823
02:27:47,331 --> 02:27:47,810
um,

4824
02:27:47,810 --> 02:27:48,770
the royal wedding,

4825
02:27:48,771 --> 02:27:49,130
I'm like,

4826
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:49,870
Nah,

4827
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:50,703
fuck,

4828
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:53,330
understand that at all.

4829
02:27:53,331 --> 02:27:55,220
I don't understand the
motivation for doing it.

4830
02:27:55,490 --> 02:27:56,920
I don't even want to get it too.

4831
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:59,630
But those are still humans.

4832
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:02,290
Like those are still people
there and that's the,

4833
02:28:02,330 --> 02:28:04,880
people don't understand that woman shit.

4834
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:06,590
She does it this way here.

4835
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:07,340
Yeah.

4836
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:07,910
You know what I mean?

4837
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:08,550
They just,

4838
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:08,980
they're,

4839
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:09,681
they're people.

4840
02:28:09,681 --> 02:28:12,980
And can you imagine if the person asks
you what you're feeding your daughter?

4841
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:13,913
Somebody did that.

4842
02:28:14,060 --> 02:28:15,080
Maybe the first time he'd be like,

4843
02:28:15,081 --> 02:28:15,261
well,

4844
02:28:15,261 --> 02:28:17,210
I can't believe it's good
once took a selfie with me,

4845
02:28:17,211 --> 02:28:18,170
but after that it would be,

4846
02:28:18,370 --> 02:28:19,970
it's still living your human life.

4847
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:21,093
The only one you have,

4848
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:22,250
you just can't interrupt

4849
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:25,040
people while they're sitting at dinner
with their family or with their friends.

4850
02:28:25,041 --> 02:28:26,860
They're just sitting there cutting food.

4851
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,820
It's just like they don't owe you that,

4852
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:29,181
like can,

4853
02:28:29,181 --> 02:28:30,390
you shouldn't ask for that.

4854
02:28:30,470 --> 02:28:32,120
It's just not the way to do it.

4855
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:33,343
It's just not,

4856
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:35,690
and you've got to know
when people can't stop.

4857
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:37,040
They just can't just say hi.

4858
02:28:37,041 --> 02:28:38,000
Can you just say hi?

4859
02:28:38,050 --> 02:28:38,360
Yeah.

4860
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:39,200
No one can say hi.

4861
02:28:39,201 --> 02:28:41,030
Everybody wants to
dress up their Facebook.

4862
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:42,920
Everyone needs that fucking selfie.

4863
02:28:42,921 --> 02:28:43,754
It's just like,

4864
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:44,480
Eh,

4865
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:44,721
we're,

4866
02:28:44,721 --> 02:28:47,270
we're in a weird space
with that stuff that,

4867
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:49,400
that whole social media shit,

4868
02:28:49,401 --> 02:28:52,320
because people want something
from you that they get up to.

4869
02:28:52,490 --> 02:28:55,370
It's not just their fam
and they want to say hi,

4870
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:57,920
they want something from you
to make them look cooler.

4871
02:28:58,190 --> 02:29:00,620
And it's like you can
give them some currency.

4872
02:29:00,621 --> 02:29:03,590
It's like you're a Pokemon
and they can pick you up and

4873
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:04,700
get a point for,

4874
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:05,533
it's weird.

4875
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:06,373
It,

4876
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:07,243
um,

4877
02:29:07,310 --> 02:29:08,143
so I,

4878
02:29:08,290 --> 02:29:08,841
I told you,

4879
02:29:08,841 --> 02:29:09,674
I was saying,

4880
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:14,780
Oh shit for breezy over doom got flat
and he was just going to fight in Russia,

4881
02:29:14,781 --> 02:29:16,160
I think against all neck.

4882
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:16,720
Yeah,

4883
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:17,330
yeah.

4884
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:17,660
Yup.

4885
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:18,450
Well that's not how,

4886
02:29:18,450 --> 02:29:19,283
that's a wrap.

4887
02:29:19,370 --> 02:29:20,210
That's a wrap on that.

4888
02:29:20,290 --> 02:29:20,720
Well,

4889
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:24,740
he's 40 years old trying to compete in
something that's a young man's game.

4890
02:29:24,890 --> 02:29:25,491
That's the thing.

4891
02:29:25,491 --> 02:29:27,440
It's like you can get mad,

4892
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:32,660
you can get outraged and
that's a reasonable result
or reasonable response if

4893
02:29:32,661 --> 02:29:32,991
you want.

4894
02:29:32,991 --> 02:29:33,980
But if you rationalize,

4895
02:29:33,981 --> 02:29:34,820
if you have empathy,

4896
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:38,390
it's like this guy still wants to do this
thing that his body won't allow him to

4897
02:29:38,391 --> 02:29:39,020
do.

4898
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:42,230
And so he's willing to bend
the rules to attempt it.

4899
02:29:42,380 --> 02:29:44,470
He failed and now he's going
to have to pay the cost.

4900
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:45,030
Francis.

4901
02:29:45,030 --> 02:29:45,301
Yeah.

4902
02:29:45,301 --> 02:29:47,190
It's a month after his knock out.

4903
02:29:47,191 --> 02:29:48,390
Lost a Volkov.

4904
02:29:49,050 --> 02:29:49,410
Right.

4905
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:51,990
Volkov fuck tomorrow among jurors.

4906
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:53,730
That guy's fucking dangerous.

4907
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:54,271
Big,

4908
02:29:54,271 --> 02:29:54,751
long,

4909
02:29:54,751 --> 02:29:56,490
tall knockout artist.

4910
02:29:56,650 --> 02:29:58,630
The heavyweight thing
is a whole other thing.

4911
02:29:59,130 --> 02:29:59,963
The thing man.

4912
02:29:59,970 --> 02:30:03,750
And when you get these seven footers
that can kick ass like Volkov.

4913
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:05,040
That's a fucking nightmare.

4914
02:30:05,070 --> 02:30:05,880
What does he like?

4915
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:07,110
He's at least six 11

4916
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:07,440
right.

4917
02:30:07,440 --> 02:30:07,960
Scary.

4918
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:08,670
What crops?

4919
02:30:08,670 --> 02:30:09,230
How tall he is.

4920
02:30:09,230 --> 02:30:10,170
He's a big guys,

4921
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:12,140
bigger than than doing by a lot of,

4922
02:30:12,141 --> 02:30:12,681
call it six,

4923
02:30:12,681 --> 02:30:13,011
six,

4924
02:30:13,011 --> 02:30:13,281
six,

4925
02:30:13,281 --> 02:30:13,671
seven,

4926
02:30:13,671 --> 02:30:14,660
somewhere in that range.

4927
02:30:14,661 --> 02:30:15,120
Right.

4928
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:15,953
Or doom.

4929
02:30:16,030 --> 02:30:16,863
Six Four.

4930
02:30:17,050 --> 02:30:17,780
Right.

4931
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:18,501
Somewhere around that.

4932
02:30:18,501 --> 02:30:23,150
And have you ever met Brett Rogers
who's Brett Rogers Rogers and now Brett

4933
02:30:23,150 --> 02:30:23,760
Rogers fought,

4934
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:24,530
uh,

4935
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:25,070
uh,

4936
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:25,601
Brett grim.

4937
02:30:25,601 --> 02:30:26,030
Rogers.

4938
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:26,863
Yeah.

4939
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:27,713
Yeah.

4940
02:30:27,890 --> 02:30:28,820
But that guy,

4941
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:31,150
that's the biggest
person I've ever really,

4942
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:31,491
yeah,

4943
02:30:31,491 --> 02:30:33,950
like I don't know what
it was about his frame,

4944
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,530
but I was trying to
interview and it's only six,

4945
02:30:36,531 --> 02:30:37,490
nine or six,

4946
02:30:37,491 --> 02:30:38,031
eight or something.

4947
02:30:38,031 --> 02:30:41,030
But it was the physical frame
of him and I was just like,

4948
02:30:41,031 --> 02:30:44,180
it was so wild as a triple h in a
restaurant one time and I was like,

4949
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:44,840
whoa,

4950
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:45,710
like giant dude.

4951
02:30:45,890 --> 02:30:46,500
He's,

4952
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:47,333
he's big,

4953
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:49,100
big athletes like this.

4954
02:30:49,101 --> 02:30:49,770
Like what the,

4955
02:30:49,770 --> 02:30:52,070
the force that they can
generate like in Gannon,

4956
02:30:52,220 --> 02:30:53,390
that ability to,

4957
02:30:53,570 --> 02:30:56,780
to create that type of power and impact.

4958
02:30:56,781 --> 02:30:57,614
This is a crazy

4959
02:30:57,650 --> 02:31:01,460
picture of Afghanistan and
extra professional basketball
player and a god who

4960
02:31:01,461 --> 02:31:02,750
looks like a tiny person.

4961
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:04,010
So weird.

4962
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:04,611
It,

4963
02:31:04,611 --> 02:31:04,940
God,

4964
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:07,010
it looks like I look
what I stand next to him.

4965
02:31:07,330 --> 02:31:10,040
Not Quite as much contrast
but pretty ridiculous.

4966
02:31:10,041 --> 02:31:10,641
But there it is.

4967
02:31:10,641 --> 02:31:11,474
Look at that.

4968
02:31:12,670 --> 02:31:13,920
I mean that's absurd.

4969
02:31:13,930 --> 02:31:15,100
Fucking crazy.

4970
02:31:15,310 --> 02:31:15,781
We just,

4971
02:31:15,781 --> 02:31:16,120
there's,

4972
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:17,140
there's more always,

4973
02:31:17,141 --> 02:31:18,430
but I have a Chihuahua,

4974
02:31:18,950 --> 02:31:21,030
the Chihuahua and you have your dog,

4975
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:22,800
you put them beside each
other and you're like,

4976
02:31:22,830 --> 02:31:24,090
that can't be the same species.

4977
02:31:24,091 --> 02:31:24,601
I know.

4978
02:31:24,601 --> 02:31:25,201
It's weird.

4979
02:31:25,201 --> 02:31:25,441
Right?

4980
02:31:25,441 --> 02:31:27,360
Then humans are just
like dogs and that way,

4981
02:31:27,390 --> 02:31:27,571
you know,

4982
02:31:27,571 --> 02:31:29,500
we vary so wildly size.

4983
02:31:29,530 --> 02:31:30,363
Yeah.

4984
02:31:30,590 --> 02:31:31,800
He listened to let's wrap this up.

4985
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:37,170
Tell people where they can get
your breakdowns and your MMA stuff.

4986
02:31:37,380 --> 02:31:38,580
If you're from Dublin,

4987
02:31:38,581 --> 02:31:39,270
Ireland,

4988
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:42,780
I'm there doing my one man show June
22nd how often are you doing this?

4989
02:31:42,810 --> 02:31:46,470
I'm doing this will be the fifth
I think there was one practice,

4990
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:48,180
one sort of friends and family.

4991
02:31:48,181 --> 02:31:49,080
I learned a lot from it.

4992
02:31:49,081 --> 02:31:50,160
Then Winnipeg and London,

4993
02:31:50,161 --> 02:31:52,080
Ontario and I did cause I knew,

4994
02:31:52,420 --> 02:31:52,860
you know,

4995
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:56,040
harmonic and they've got some good
friends there that would be supportive and

4996
02:31:56,041 --> 02:31:56,460
that was good.

4997
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:59,400
Then I sold out a little venue
in Toronto and what really,

4998
02:31:59,401 --> 02:32:01,440
really well and then now Ireland,

4999
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:06,090
so the 22nd and I'm in Ireland on my
Instagram page you can click through,

5000
02:32:06,091 --> 02:32:07,050
but and John,

5001
02:32:07,051 --> 02:32:08,190
Kevin has got to be my guest.

5002
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:09,540
Beautiful website.

5003
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:10,913
It's coming up.

5004
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,980
It literally could be coming up
today or in the next couple of days.

5005
02:32:13,981 --> 02:32:15,150
I think it's Robin black,
