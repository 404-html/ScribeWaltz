1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,260
I was influenced by hotel a massively.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:04,650
Yeah,

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,200
like as a new faculty drinking too.

5
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,010
Did that,

6
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,301
oh no,

7
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:08,134
I was thing.

8
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,000
No I was fine.

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,833
I told you I came in,

10
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,970
explained that because
this is a crazy story.

11
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,500
You didn't say this on the podcast.

12
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,630
I have when I was in 1997,

13
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:20,070
Rollingstone magazine wrote a six and
a half page article about me calling me

14
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:21,690
the number one party in
the mall in the country.

15
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,100
It's actually gets a little weirder.

16
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,180
But are you doing standup back then?

17
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,390
No,

18
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,223
just partying.

19
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,640
Just had a notorious reputation of
Florida state for being like funny,

20
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,320
but being a wild party animal.

21
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,580
Like what kind of Shit were you doing?

22
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,540
Just Fun Shit.

23
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,374
Like uh,

24
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,040
like fun.

25
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,600
I think Wa loudest guy in the room.

26
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,260
Shit.

27
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,140
You know like I remember I used to climb
up on this telephone pole outside the

28
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,310
bars on Tennessee street.

29
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,990
There'll be 500 people out
there and I just stand up.

30
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,490
I go,

31
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,950
everyone shut the fuck up and listen.

32
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,810
If you want to smoke weed,

33
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,080
go to my house and the
cops are all sitting there.

34
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,370
I have tons of weed,

35
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:57,210
enough for everybody and we're all
gonna have a blast and get eye.

36
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,260
If you know where I live.

37
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:58,891
You're invited.

38
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,090
If you don't ask someone,

39
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,480
just no one tell the fucking cops and
you'd have literally 500 people just

40
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:07,140
giggling at the idea that someone was
offering them weed in front of the cops

41
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:07,800
face.

42
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,390
And what are the cops
say when you did this?

43
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:09,650
Uh,

44
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,800
they would laugh too.

45
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,080
Like one time for an election,

46
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,201
uh,

47
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:17,280
gotten naked for this election and just
shit on a pizza box and won the election

48
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,230
election for what?

49
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,920
For my fraternity or just got up naked
and shit on a pizza box and then every

50
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,520
you want.

51
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,353
And then I won.

52
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,170
Did you wipe?

53
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,220
Not just shit.

54
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,203
I just shit,

55
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,760
I learned one very important
lesson when you go number two,

56
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:30,720
you also go one,

57
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,420
cause I pissed all over the feet
on everyone that was sitting.

58
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,020
I can't stop it when you go one.

59
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,200
And so I won the election.

60
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,190
So like all these stories came out and
then rolling stones like let's do a

61
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:44,641
fucking,

62
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,810
let's do an article on him.

63
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,700
Oh my God.

64
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,521
It gets crazier.

65
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:47,731
Ready?

66
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,060
Sorry for the you already for the
part that you go that you go bullshit.

67
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,530
I will never say bull shit.

68
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,730
I've heard enough of your stories.

69
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,290
So uh,

70
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,910
so Oliver Stone optioned the rights
to my life and then from the article.

71
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,310
So then I try to stand up and I moved
to New York to start doing stamps.

72
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,410
I did it once and to in a tile house,

73
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:05,700
you know,

74
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,230
we went amazing.

75
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,480
I can offer my own morning
show in Tallahassee.

76
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,051
Really?

77
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:10,380
Yeah.

78
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,011
Oliver Stone option.

79
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:11,581
The rights in my life.

80
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,460
Like I start doing stand up five minutes
later will Smith sees me to stand up

81
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:15,930
and I get a deal
development deal with him.

82
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,000
Like right out the gate
it's like bill burst style,

83
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,010
like been doing standup
for no time at all.

84
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,520
Development deal based on the article and
that the fact that I could competently

85
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:27,330
do stand up somewhat and then the
development deal falls apart with Oliver

86
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:27,480
Stone.

87
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,230
All the guys that have submitted their
scripts for Oliver Stone's movie about my

88
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:31,800
life,

89
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,600
then get their intellectual property back.

90
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,720
One of the guy takes his movie changes,

91
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:40,260
my name sells at National Lampoon
and it becomes a movie Van Wilder.

92
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,240
So theoretically,

93
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,890
and I say this theoretically loosely,

94
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,240
I'll never be able to sue.

95
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm never would sue,

96
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:46,914
I never would sue.

97
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,840
But I went into national lampoon and did,

98
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,130
do you remember Kevin Couch?

99
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,590
He used to have a showing nationally,

100
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,783
XM radio.

101
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,901
And I told him,

102
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,171
I said,

103
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,220
bring some exact sin.

104
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,140
I've always wanted to
find out if this is true.

105
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,980
So then he brought some execs in and

106
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,370
I start telling the story just like I
am you one of the guys fucking locks up.

107
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,030
Like,

108
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,480
hold on,

109
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,313
stop right now.

110
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,951
What do you want?

111
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,611
What's going on here?

112
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:07,600
Is this like an ambush?

113
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,051
And I was like,

114
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:08,171
no,

115
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,660
I just want to be able to
tell it on radio and no,

116
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,440
I'm not lying.

117
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,490
That's all I care about.

118
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,640
All I care about is the
story being like true.

119
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,193
And he was like,

120
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,071
what do you want?

121
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,330
Like your own radio show.

122
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,010
I'm like,

123
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,500
Ugh,

124
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,310
fine.

125
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,000
And then he's like,

126
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,490
we'll do a show parting with the
original Dan while are you happy?

127
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,563
And I was like yeah.

128
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,420
And so then he was like pretty much I
was like so I can say true but yeah we're

129
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:30,730
worried you were going to sue them.

130
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,800
We were telling stories
this week and about like,

131
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,220
like one time at okay one time,

132
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,830
one morning I thought I was,

133
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,060
my parents were at a town,

134
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,860
my little sister was 10,

135
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:45,490
I was probably 21 I was drinking a
lot at the time cause it was you know,

136
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,390
party animal shit.

137
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,280
And then I was pissing a lot of places
that like in the round houses like I

138
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:54,600
pissed on my ex girlfriend's dining
room table and was walked in by her dad.

139
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,730
Do you want to talk about
a fucking nightmare?

140
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,111
Waiting,

141
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:58,441
waiting,

142
00:03:58,441 --> 00:03:58,711
waiting,

143
00:03:58,711 --> 00:03:58,951
waiting.

144
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:01,410
Were you pissed on the dining room?

145
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,540
MEDOC her dad walked
in and caught her dad,

146
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,980
Larry Medoc in Orlando.

147
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:08,341
Larry,

148
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:08,881
if you're listening,

149
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:09,120
I,

150
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,010
I w I'm guilty.

151
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,050
I so here's,

152
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,440
okay cause I never really
accepted blame for it.

153
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:20,250
I always said it never fucking happened
cause it cause I didn't want it to cause

154
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:20,701
I didn't want,

155
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:21,060
okay,

156
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,980
why did you do it was thanksgiving.

157
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,200
It was right after the rolling
stone magazine came out and so,

158
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,960
and I go back to party on what do you
mean the rolling Stone magazine with a

159
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:28,620
number,

160
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,920
the rolling stone in 1997 call me the
number one party animal in the country

161
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,860
just for someone who doesn't know
and then that was a big deal.

162
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,400
I became famous and I
became famous in like Tampa,

163
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,060
Florida,

164
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,451
Tampa,

165
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:39,961
Tallahassee,

166
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:40,441
Gainesville,

167
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:41,160
Orlando,

168
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,770
anywhere that I had people with
four went to Florida state lived,

169
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,360
I was paying you.

170
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,061
They knew who I was.

171
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:45,450
They were like,

172
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,560
cause the fucker party guy.

173
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,710
So if I went out shots really we'd any
do people put drugs in my hand like it

174
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,340
was fucking insane.

175
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:55,200
I get Roofie I got roof a couple of times.

176
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,640
So you became like a celebrity partier.

177
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,030
I became the guy that I'd walk after the,

178
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,661
before the article,

179
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:01,441
I was just the loud,

180
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,130
fun,

181
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,960
shirtless guy on top of the bar,

182
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,430
getting everyone in a frenzy.

183
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,320
And then when the article came out it was
like the fucking lineman would come to

184
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:10,591
the bar.

185
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:13,320
I drank at Yonnie's and they'd
pull me aside and they're like,

186
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,220
you're drinking with us tonight.

187
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,720
We want to drink with a party animal.

188
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,870
And then I just be up with these lines
and like four lineman and we'd be just

189
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,900
doing shots and shots and shots
and these guys are 350 pounds,

190
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,850
two to 18 at the time,

191
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:27,300
probably like going through to 18
and probably more like two 25 but,

192
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,340
but and so I became like,

193
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,630
like I say famous,

194
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,870
I say like reality show famous like
the way Snookie her first season was,

195
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:36,630
you know,

196
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,840
so that's how you were in your
town and you're in Tallahassee.

197
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,110
If I went like right after that
article came out in Tallahassee,

198
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:44,760
definitely in Orlando,

199
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,820
I knew 40% of the bar
knew who I was in Tampa.

200
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:51,390
Everyone knew who I was back when
people actually read magazines that it's

201
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,610
bigger reality shows before the Internet,

202
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,230
before the Internet is a big one for,

203
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,520
it's like you were in this,

204
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:59,840
so like you were was on Oprah called
and wanted me to be on her show,

205
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,250
but she wanted my parents to be on to,

206
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,851
and mom was like,

207
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,830
I'm not gonna do that
at my fucking parents.

208
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,180
So I did everything I did like
fucking they sent you ready for this?

209
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,940
This is how bizarre this
eight period period got,

210
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,890
they sent ESPN send a tour bus with two
actors in it to come shoot a commercial

211
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,310
of partying with me of what it's like
to party with a number one party animal

212
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,361
for the x games.

213
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:20,541
Right.

214
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,620
They wanted to like the,

215
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,050
and one of the actors
was Johnny Knoxville,

216
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,520
fucking bizarre shit.

217
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,690
So Johnny Knoxville,

218
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:27,890
we meet and he says,

219
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:28,724
you do drugs.

220
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,883
And I was like,

221
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,310
I was like,

222
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,791
in my head,

223
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,090
I'm like,

224
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,361
yeah,

225
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:32,841
I'm an adult.

226
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,320
Let's do it.

227
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,670
So going to this tour bus,

228
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,800
I never done pills like pills.

229
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,270
And so he liked pores
like Clemson on shit.

230
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,750
Nope,

231
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,060
nope.

232
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,350
Yeah,

233
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,111
little stronger.

234
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,100
Probably like Pete
Tylenol PM probably still.

235
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,230
He's just poured some tea,

236
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,090
some Tylenol or whatever it was.

237
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,080
He pours it with my hand.

238
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,930
And so I like thumb one,

239
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,591
like finger one,

240
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:55,580
hold it down and he gives me too and I
pop one and then he starts passing a bow.

241
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,020
So you are being calculated about it.

242
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:57,321
I was like,

243
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,220
I don't know what the fuck I'm taking.

244
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,091
I have no idea.

245
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:00,230
And I haven't started drinking.

246
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:00,580
I haven't done it.

247
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,131
Like I'm just like,

248
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:01,964
what the fuck?

249
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,930
And then not like someone might not die
of a fucking overdose around on that

250
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:06,460
guy.

251
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:06,920
Yes,

252
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,161
but he,

253
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,210
this was before jackass.

254
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,870
This is,

255
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,440
they were just great.

256
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
This is like five,

257
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,360
10 years before jackass.

258
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,230
Those are wild dunes.

259
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,010
And Johnny Knoxville is passing bills
around and he's lightened a Bong Bong hits

260
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:16,251
and he's,

261
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,440
you gotta be careful with that guy
videos he's putting in videos of,

262
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:19,880
of,

263
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,780
of uh,

264
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,591
of Bam.

265
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,990
Margera trying to bring a bottle
over his head and he's like,

266
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:24,590
watch this.

267
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,300
And I were laughing our tits off.

268
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,550
This is well before anyone
knows what the fuck this is.

269
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,810
And then I look at the other guy,

270
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:30,830
I forgot the other guy's name,

271
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,581
but I go,

272
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,151
what was that?

273
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:32,511
And he was like,

274
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,960
dilauded you never had
dilauded go it's dilaudid.

275
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,291
And he was like,

276
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,470
it's like pharmaceutical heroin.

277
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:36,861
It's awesome.

278
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:37,311
You're gonna love it.

279
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:37,880
And I was like,

280
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,990
thank God I only took one.

281
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,801
Jesus Christ.

282
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:40,371
That's like what?

283
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,070
Like they used to give chicks
in the wild west movies.

284
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,400
Yeah.

285
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,300
When they had an issue.

286
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,200
I have,

287
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,350
she needs some dilaudid.

288
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,830
Dilaudid.

289
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,650
Yeah.

290
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,150
So we ended up partying all night.

291
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,230
We take this tour bus out,

292
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:51,690
fill it up,

293
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,131
dresses,

294
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:52,491
women,

295
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:53,660
throw herself down the stairs.

296
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:57,350
This is women fucking the corner of
the craziest nights that drinking beer

297
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,550
bottles over our heads.

298
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,370
It was the craziest
fucking night of my life.

299
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:02,830
Cut.

300
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,670
Uh Oh yeah,

301
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:03,831
yeah,

302
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:03,961
yeah,

303
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:04,110
yeah,

304
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,490
yeah.

305
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:04,851
So,

306
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,600
um,

307
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,021
there were no,

308
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:06,440
they were,

309
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,970
they were a fake breakaway beer bottles.

310
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,440
But we were like,

311
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,810
but we had seen Bam do it
and we thought it was funny.

312
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,720
So we were doing it with
these fake breakaway bottles
but were outfitted with a

313
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,350
real bottle.

314
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,890
Bam.

315
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,210
I think it was Bam and his posse.

316
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:18,560
But it was the CKY posse.

317
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,830
They were trying to break a
beer bottle over their head.

318
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,350
The rolling stone stuff was
crazy when that came out.

319
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,550
It was like being famous.

320
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,430
Cut Back to how I pissed
on my girlfriend's table.

321
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:28,921
Yes.

322
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,020
So thank you.

323
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,520
So that was like unwinding.

324
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,670
That was like untangling a necklace.

325
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,530
So,

326
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,360
so we go out in Orlando,

327
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,310
this is right after Thanksgiving
when everyone's home.

328
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,800
So everyone I know from
Orlando's at every bar,

329
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,960
all in like church street I
think is the name of the street.

330
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,000
So we go out and it's fucking chaos.

331
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:47,834
I'm with my girlfriend,

332
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,550
her sister and her sister's boyfriend
who was the coolest fucking guy and he'll

333
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,623
always have weed.

334
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,860
So we go out and buying me shots.

335
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:56,671
We're getting fucking hammered.

336
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,110
Her parents had just bought a house,

337
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,680
just bought this brand
new house just like I,

338
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:02,880
and it was their dream house.

339
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,840
We had Thanksgiving together.

340
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:04,830
We held hands,

341
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,360
talked about how at the table,

342
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,610
how this is everything we've
worked for guys as a team.

343
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:09,390
We saved,

344
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,650
we scrimped week anyway,

345
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,560
we go back to her house and I'm like,

346
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,430
I'm not fucking done.

347
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,290
Like I want to keep
drinking and this Guy Dan,

348
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:16,620
he's like,

349
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:16,861
oh yeah,

350
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:17,610
me too.

351
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,370
So we get like a 12 pack of beer and
we'd go out to the dock and d and that's

352
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:21,810
all I remember Danny.

353
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,630
Then the next morning we counts
everything to me because my,

354
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,910
she walks in the first
thing in the morning,

355
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,650
did you piss on my dining room table?

356
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,191
And I'm like,

357
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:29,461
no,

358
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:30,390
why would I fucking do that?

359
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:30,961
I'm a grown man.

360
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:31,760
I don't piss on tables.

361
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,250
She was like,

362
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,660
my dad said he caught
you pissing on our table.

363
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:33,811
I'm like,

364
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:34,680
your dad is crazy.

365
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,050
He doesn't like me cause I'm in the party
animal and he's trying to get me out

366
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:37,381
of your life.

367
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:38,340
That's what's fucking going on.

368
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,951
And you can gather.

369
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:39,880
Fuck I can remember going to blame me.

370
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,613
I'm the party animal.

371
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:41,731
No,

372
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,050
I'm straight.

373
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,883
I'm sure.

374
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,913
I'm sure

375
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,350
the fuck you're talking to right now.

376
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:50,460
He wants me out of your life.

377
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,480
Number one party animal,

378
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,020
the country,

379
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,830
but something to that.

380
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,011
Yeah,

381
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,460
I'm sure I actually used the words so

382
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,433
you probably had it.

383
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,180
She should have it explaining it.

384
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,531
Aw.

385
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:01,610
Did you ever think about getting,

386
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,500
I'm the party animal tattooed
anywhere in your body.

387
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,720
I was thinking about getting a squirrel
with a beer can and a cigarette that

388
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,040
said the party squirrel on at one time.

389
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,100
Who's going to fucking question that
too so we can tell me what your 10 to

390
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:13,430
about.

391
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,580
If I pulled you over,

392
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,910
if I was a cop and I pulled you over
and you had a party squirrel Tatooine I

393
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,220
immediately take you to jail.

394
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,821
I'm like,

395
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:22,910
I know this guy did something fucked
up in the last couple of months.

396
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,410
You've just got to get it out of them.

397
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,880
We just going to sit down and go,

398
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:26,601
you know what you did?

399
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,400
Just tell me we know what you did.

400
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:29,151
Just tell me.

401
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:30,440
We'll all get out of here early.

402
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:31,850
We'll get you a nice quick sentence.

403
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,590
Just tell me what happened.

404
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,570
So I don't even know what
you're talking about.

405
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:36,060
Okay,

406
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,870
so,

407
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,540
so she get back in your fucking car.

408
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,650
She goes out to the breakfast
table where family is.

409
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,543
Oh my God,

410
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,410
how much piss are we talking about here?

411
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,700
In my head,

412
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,510
it didn't happen.

413
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:47,830
And your head,

414
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,351
it didn't happen.

415
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:49,510
You didn't highly blacked out.

416
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,353
Fucking,

417
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,051
I swear to you,

418
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:51,950
all my children right now,

419
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,911
I laid in that bed,

420
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:53,271
rolled over,

421
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:53,541
and I went,

422
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,150
how far Wayman then how do you,

423
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,791
how do you know your home?

424
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,990
He didn't fucking sell you down the river.

425
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,030
Maybe he pissed on a table
and then say that you did it.

426
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,410
That's why he woke you up in the morning.

427
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,440
He knew you blacked out and then you
blame you for pissing on the table.

428
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:04,520
That's what's going
through my head right now.

429
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:05,990
As I rolled back over and I go,

430
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:06,371
fuck them.

431
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:07,210
Maybe you can go bad if your,

432
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,690
but maybe,

433
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,920
maybe that would be called shitting,

434
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,430
but yeah,

435
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,070
maybe we call it a Brian train wreck.

436
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,120
You smoking a regular
cigarette over there?

437
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:17,411
No,

438
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,244
it's got wheat in it.

439
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,403
All right.

440
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,243
So,

441
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,150
so Danny,

442
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,300
the boyfriend comes in and he's like,

443
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,100
comes in and his eyes are like so excited.

444
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,080
He goes,

445
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,170
I heard you piss on their table.

446
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,401
And I'm like,

447
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:30,731
no,

448
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,930
why is everyone fucking saying that?

449
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:32,530
And he's like,

450
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,470
cause her dad walked in on your
pissing on the table and I said,

451
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,460
he's fucking lying.

452
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:36,970
He goes,

453
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,360
man,

454
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,670
he is pretty set in the,

455
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:42,250
he saw you pissing on
their dining room table.

456
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,821
And I go,

457
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:43,390
Danny,

458
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,650
I don't remember fucking anything.

459
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:45,400
He goes,

460
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,641
he goes,

461
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:46,600
well we got these beers.

462
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:47,411
We went out to their doc.

463
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:47,831
Do you remember that?

464
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,041
And I go,

465
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:48,790
yes.

466
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,361
And he was like,

467
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:49,991
and I had a joint.

468
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:50,261
And I go,

469
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:50,471
okay,

470
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:50,921
I remember that.

471
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:51,221
And he's like,

472
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,240
and then you ate the joint.

473
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:52,601
And I was like,

474
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,434
I don't that.

475
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,821
And he goes,

476
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:55,091
yeah,

477
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:55,481
I said,

478
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,610
hold this and you ate it and laughed.

479
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,550
And then we killed all the
beers out there and I go,

480
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,001
fuck,

481
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,750
we did.

482
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,081
And he was like,

483
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:02,231
yeah.

484
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,120
And then you start piecing
back like little things.

485
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:04,570
I go,

486
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,490
did we get stuck in a
phone booth last night?

487
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,511
And he's like,

488
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:07,961
no,

489
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,930
we got locked in their
food cabinet like in their,

490
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,400
in their food closet,

491
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,570
like a pantry because in their pantries
were eating and their kitchen and then

492
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,480
this and this.

493
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,751
I start,

494
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:17,171
remember I go,

495
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:17,800
yeah,

496
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,390
so like a girlfriend come out.

497
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,250
The girlfriend's coming
and it was a sliding door,

498
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,970
so it was,

499
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,890
we were eating and the
girlfriends came out,

500
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:24,730
the sisters and they go,

501
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,080
you're fucking making a ton of noise.

502
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:28,600
So me and Danny went into
the pantry and shut the door,

503
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,300
but then we couldn't figure out how to
open it because there wasn't a handle.

504
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,870
You guys were hammered and he's had a
pantry and they shoved you in the pantry

505
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:35,890
to quiet you down.

506
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,860
We shoved ourselves into the pantry
so that we could continue eating.

507
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:39,131
We were like,

508
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:39,761
we're going to bed.

509
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:40,270
They left.

510
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,051
We went to the Pantry,

511
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,770
shut the door,

512
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,970
and then I remember sitting in the pantry.

513
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,480
I do remember this distinctly is us
being in the pantry thinking we were in a

514
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:46,991
phone booth,

515
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,700
laughing how hard all,

516
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,920
they had all this food in this
phone booth and we're like,

517
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,290
he believe this boom news
has fucking Doritos in it.

518
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,610
So then that's all I remember.

519
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,510
So then he says to me,

520
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,300
he goes them and he's really adamant.

521
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:01,940
So he leaves.

522
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,070
I lay back down and I'm like,

523
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,900
I can't believe I'm being
framed for this shit.

524
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,080
All the sudden I start,

525
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:09,040
do you ever have one of those we use,

526
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,810
remember the dream you had last night?

527
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,660
And I distinctly remember
seeing her dad in his underwear.

528
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:14,494
In my dream.

529
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:15,641
I'm like,

530
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:15,911
wait,

531
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,890
I did have a dream about
her dad and his underwear.

532
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:18,724
That's odd.

533
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,773
And then I was like,

534
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,460
but he was in here yelling at me.

535
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,241
There's not a jury.

536
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,650
And yet she has with an old man.

537
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,160
No,

538
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,481
he,

539
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:25,450
what happened was,

540
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:25,931
and this,

541
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:26,890
and then I start going,

542
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,641
oh shit,

543
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,720
this totally did happen.

544
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,550
I woke up in the middle of the night,

545
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,920
walked out to their dining room table,

546
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,730
erect and tried to go to the bathroom.

547
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,710
You know how you kind
of try to lean it down.

548
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,130
So I must have been making a ton of
noise at their dining room table.

549
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,600
Pissed on their dining room table,

550
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,950
full blown pissed on their dining.

551
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:45,784
When you tell me this now,

552
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,170
now I'm remembering.

553
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:47,530
I'm like,

554
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,190
Oh shit,

555
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,210
I fucking do remember.

556
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,350
You remember being erect?

557
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,240
I remember,

558
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,551
I remember,

559
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:52,210
I remember,

560
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,740
I just remember trying to pee.

561
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:55,840
You know how when you have one of
those nights where you're like in the

562
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:56,171
bathroom,

563
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:56,411
you're like,

564
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:58,660
I can't get to like lean forward.

565
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:00,280
So I'm leaning forward over
their dining room table,

566
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:01,060
trying to Piss,

567
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,050
making a ton of noise,

568
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,250
knocking everything off of it.

569
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,730
He comes out in his tighty whities I
remember that because she came back in and

570
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,320
I go to see your dad were
tidy whities and she goes,

571
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:08,791
he does well,

572
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,160
I don't want to,

573
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,993
nevermind.

574
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,840
I then you can't dream.

575
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,131
I like,

576
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:12,901
no one wears off.

577
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:13,734
So anyway,

578
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,900
I dream about tighty whities twenties
let's say 26 25 so here's the worst part.

579
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:22,990
He yells at me and he goes,

580
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:24,160
where the fuck?

581
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,270
What the fuck are you doing?

582
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:25,750
And I said,

583
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,130
I'm going to bed.

584
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,233
And he said,

585
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,620
where's your bed?

586
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:29,940
And I,

587
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,120
and I pointed to the dining room table.

588
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,050
I go right here.

589
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:32,381
And he goes,

590
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:32,900
what?

591
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,191
So I,

592
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,810
David Blaine the tablecloth,

593
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,800
pull it,

594
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,330
lay on the bed on the,

595
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,610
on top of their table at the table.

596
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:42,760
You pissed him in my own business
and my own this in a superman,

597
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,660
cape full of Piss,

598
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,550
just lit curtain myself.

599
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,500
Go back to sleep and he gets me up and
walked me into my bed and puts back in my

600
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:51,771
bed.

601
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:52,250
And I'm like,

602
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,120
what a nice guy.

603
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,050
We,

604
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,930
it gets so with our
relationship was fucking doomed.

605
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,830
Like there was no,

606
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,640
I get up.

607
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,630
That is a nice guy.

608
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:03,830
He's a really nice Larry Maddock is a
saint because if that happened on one of

609
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:05,240
my daughters and my house,

610
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,830
I would have beat the fucking kid's ass.

611
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,910
So I get up.

612
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,743
Would you really man?

613
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,260
No.

614
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,150
Do it like that again though.

615
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,400
I would beat the fucking kids ass.

616
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,113
Passionate your voice.

617
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,350
Have you ever considered acting?

618
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,330
Maybe Ip?

619
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,950
All the time when I'm really wasted.

620
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,750
Like if I black out drunk night,

621
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,150
I'll wake up and think like,

622
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,341
Oh,

623
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:23,300
I have to pee right now.

624
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:25,610
And I always like put on a
shirt the next morning like,

625
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:25,761
oh,

626
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:26,900
why is it smelled like urine odd?

627
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,800
I did it again.

628
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,993
I'm done.

629
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,210
I do it all the time when I drink a lot.

630
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,060
So when you drank a lot,

631
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,893
you'll piss the bed.

632
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,150
I think I get confused and
I wake up and I'm like,

633
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,140
I just pee on my
champions suitcases alive.

634
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,203
Like

635
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,960
really drunk people.

636
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:42,711
Peanut suitcases.

637
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:42,851
Yeah.

638
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:43,940
That's actually fairly common.

639
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:44,130
Yeah,

640
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,400
it happens maybe twice a year.

641
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,600
The last time you were here,

642
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,820
there's a fucking story
about the Russian mob.

643
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,350
We tease these bitches.

644
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,570
We let these people right now on Twitter,

645
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:54,800
they have been going crazy all day.

646
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:58,310
Do not let Bert Kreischer get out of
there without the Russian mob story.

647
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,000
Right.

648
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,230
Tell us what the fuck happened.

649
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,490
All right.

650
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,490
This is in 1993 probably I
think is what I went to Russia.

651
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,320
I was taking rushing
classes at Florida state.

652
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:13,640
I thought they were Spanish classes
because I thought there has been this

653
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,750
glasses because I,

654
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,240
it was a noon class and I
signed up and then I was like,

655
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,950
fucking sweet Spanish at noon.

656
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,970
I can phone that in.

657
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:23,060
And then I get there and
they start writing in a new
language and new alphabet.

658
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:23,391
And I'm like,

659
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:23,900
all right,

660
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,040
this clearly isn't Spanish.

661
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,270
So then I said,

662
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,781
I'm going to leave.

663
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:27,620
And the teacher's like,

664
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,250
listen,

665
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,083
don't leave.

666
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,923
Um,

667
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,830
because if you leave,

668
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,200
we can't have a class and I
can't get my master's degree.

669
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,591
So,

670
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:34,520
but if you stick around,

671
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,571
I'll talk to,

672
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:36,320
you have to have class.

673
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,160
I get done the end of the class.

674
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:37,994
She was like,

675
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,451
listen,

676
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:38,811
don't,

677
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:39,410
uh,

678
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,800
you know,

679
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,990
if you don't leave and I want
and just show up at class,

680
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:42,824
I'll give you a c.

681
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,610
I was like,

682
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,270
done,

683
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,930
done.

684
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,920
So I took Russian,

685
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,851
I took Russian one,

686
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:47,031
two,

687
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:48,490
and three because these kids need it,

688
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,630
another guy in the class
to take these classes.

689
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:51,950
So then finally I take rush.

690
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,570
I'd take it right from
when we go to Russia,

691
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,680
we go to Russia.

692
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,521
But this is Rochelle.

693
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,500
Like when the mob ran Russia,

694
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,543
like are you,

695
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,740
are you guys aware of that?

696
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,250
No.

697
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:01,730
Okay.

698
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,330
In like the nine late nineties
mid nineties the Marbury
and everything that had

699
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:06,110
to do with Russia.

700
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,460
So when going over to Russia,

701
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,294
you had to,

702
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,950
you had to literally pay off the
mob in order to go and study abroad.

703
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,250
So we paid off the mob and they gave us
in return to banditos too young mobsters

704
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,910
who would go everywhere with us.

705
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,200
They lived in our hotel,

706
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,550
they stayed with us.

707
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:23,870
They went on tours with us.

708
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,350
They weren't,

709
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,430
they were did everything with us.

710
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:29,240
Their names are eager and Sasha and
when we got our teaser was like,

711
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:29,571
listen,

712
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:30,620
this is Igor and Sasha.

713
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,870
They will be ghosting us with my
teacher who was there with me.

714
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:34,010
It was like during the fucking mob,

715
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,360
Igor inside go inside.

716
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,670
They were guy named
Bruce and they were like,

717
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:38,120
and they were,

718
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,361
oh,

719
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:39,120
it gets worse.

720
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,953
So,

721
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,881
so they like,

722
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:41,270
listen,

723
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,440
whatever you do to our class,

724
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,400
do not talk to them.

725
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,390
Do not interact with them.

726
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,310
Do not engage them.

727
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,750
They're only here to shadow it.

728
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:50,340
So in my head I'm like fucking
get to know these guys,

729
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:50,880
right?

730
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,030
Like get a bottle of vodka,

731
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:52,821
a six pack of Baltic,

732
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,300
go knock on their door.

733
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,111
Now mind you,

734
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,340
I speak no Russian at the time,

735
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,380
no rushing because I'd never
studied in any of the classes.

736
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,100
So first night there a knock on Igor in
Sasha's room and they're having a party

737
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:04,050
in there and like fucking all
their friends are in their room.

738
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,880
They lived right next to me and Kendra,

739
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:07,590
my teacher lived across
the hall from Igor.

740
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,150
So knock on their door,

741
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,420
Igor opens the door and he
looks like a fucking thug.

742
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,140
He's got,

743
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,160
he's got like a wife beater on a cigarette
of beer and he just looks at me in

744
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,990
Russia and he just goes sto.

745
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,990
And now the second he says
that I start panicking.

746
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,010
All the phrases I had in my head that
I was trying to say all disappear.

747
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:29,790
And all I say to Igor in
Russian is I am the machine.

748
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,160
And so,

749
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,791
but I just said,

750
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,624
y'all machine though.

751
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,640
And he went stole.

752
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,080
And now I don't know what I said.

753
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:40,291
I'm like,

754
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:40,471
did it,

755
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:40,951
what did I just say?

756
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:41,784
I'll fuck you up.

757
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,031
Like,

758
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:42,481
and I go,

759
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:42,721
I go,

760
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,471
I am the machine.

761
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:44,160
And he goes,

762
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,940
say it again.

763
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,211
I said,

764
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:46,044
I have let me scene.

765
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,000
And then he starts laughing and he
brings me into the room and he's like,

766
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,690
hold on,

767
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,380
say it again.

768
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,310
And so I say it to the room,

769
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:51,180
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.

770
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:51,450
I'm like,

771
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,171
I'm the machine.

772
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:52,501
And they're like,

773
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,780
you're the machine and the machine.

774
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,430
I said that all fucking
night with these guys.

775
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,200
That's the communication we had.

776
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:01,500
As I said on the machine and Igor
and Sasha and I became best friends,

777
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:01,950
right?

778
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,100
We did everything together.

779
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,260
If we went on a field trip,

780
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,761
they would tell me,

781
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:06,151
machine,

782
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:07,380
you don't need to go on the field trips,

783
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,243
come drink with us.

784
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,510
So now,

785
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,470
uh,

786
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,380
cut to one day we have to
take a train to Moscow.

787
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,460
No different mob.

788
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,650
Ran The train to Moscow and a driftwood,

789
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,340
Tra tra Marbury and Moscow and Igor,

790
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,711
Sasha,

791
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,360
we're not allowed to cross
boundaries and it's all me.

792
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:21,661
They said,

793
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,320
listen,

794
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,071
we're not going to go with you,

795
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:23,970
but we've taken care of you.

796
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:28,380
We've talked to the mobsters on the
train and in Moscow because we had to pay

797
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:28,930
them too.

798
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,590
They,

799
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,870
they weren't allowed to come with you.

800
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:31,740
There weren't allowed to come with us.

801
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,980
And we're paying a different mob
now to protect us on the train,

802
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,350
making a different mob
to protect us in Moscow.

803
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,191
Holy Shit.

804
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,300
So they said,

805
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,021
we've taken care of it.

806
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:40,711
Don't worry about it.

807
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,990
So they take me to the train and uh,

808
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,600
they introduced me to our tune.

809
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:44,731
Who?

810
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:45,241
Gangsters?

811
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:45,630
Igor.

812
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,463
Igor.

813
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,120
Igor.

814
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,340
Where do you three words
that afford dude's Igor.

815
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,600
And there's not a lot of names in Russia.

816
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:52,051
It's Alex.

817
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:52,884
Igor or Sascha.

818
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,470
What about fuel?

819
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,303
So,

820
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,410
so Igor,

821
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,010
Igor,

822
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,843
he,

823
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,720
my ego says,

824
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:58,554
so these are yours.

825
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,820
This is the machine.

826
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,980
If you give them alcohol,

827
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,890
you'll have a great time.

828
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,200
So even when you like through the roof,

829
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:04,470
they were like,

830
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,010
awesome.

831
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,371
Don't worry,

832
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,210
we've taken care of you.

833
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,890
We were sitting in first class.

834
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,060
You're not sitting with your class.

835
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,650
You're sitting in first class to Moscow.

836
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,610
And I'm like,

837
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,151
Holy Shit,

838
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:13,020
this is what I'm talking about.

839
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:13,950
And I bring another guy,

840
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,700
John Bolshoi,

841
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,151
big John.

842
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,850
I bring him with me to
go sit in first class.

843
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:18,331
And sure enough,

844
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:18,491
man,

845
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:20,700
we were fucking FirstClass
just meet these two.

846
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:22,590
Igor is John the conductor?

847
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,860
I shit you not the conductor
before the train takes off,

848
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,030
comes into the room.

849
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,080
I swear to you,

850
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,730
rips off the band on this thing.

851
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,470
Says this is the
president for the machine.

852
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,270
It would be an honor
to do a shot with you.

853
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:33,991
And I'm like,

854
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:34,650
Whoa,

855
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,610
this is fucking right.

856
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:40,170
So I do a shot with its conductor and
we pound this vodka within like fucking

857
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:40,531
30,

858
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,191
45 minutes.

859
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:42,630
We're done all the vodka in the room.

860
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,350
Whoa.

861
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,640
We're drinking hard.

862
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:47,890
And my classes all in coach and I'm
sitting in first class and eat more Negro.

863
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:48,940
Like let's go get more Ivanka.

864
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,361
And I'm like,

865
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,010
done it.

866
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,250
These guys run the fucking train.

867
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,031
So we get up,

868
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:55,240
we walk into the bar cart
and a biggie or says machine,

869
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,500
grab a Apollo,

870
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:56,980

00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,280

872
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,360
grab some bread club.

873
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:58,780
And I'm like,

874
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,613
that's bread.

875
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,940
I'm understanding Russia.

876
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,510
He's like,

877
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,320
grab some Sia,

878
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,980
this cheese.

879
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,580
I'm like,

880
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,420
I'm learning Russian.

881
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:04,781
I'm looking at,

882
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:05,730
John is standing behind me.

883
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:05,960
It's like,

884
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,670
eh.

885
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:06,931
He's like,

886
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:07,291
Grandpa,

887
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:07,630
can I go?

888
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,291
I know that one.

889
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,040
And he's like,

890
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,910
grab all the money,

891
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,960
grab all the rubels.

892
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:11,231
And I go,

893
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:12,064
what?

894
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,380
I look around and were
robbing the bar cart.

895
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,210
What?

896
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,080
The bartender standing like this.

897
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,230
Everyone's standing against the wall
and I'm sitting behind the bar with a

898
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:21,041
handful of rubles,

899
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,660
a bottle of vodka and
a thing of bread going,

900
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,860
holy fuck.

901
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,911
John looks at me.

902
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:25,600
And he's like,

903
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,051
just take it.

904
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,900
Let's go take all the
fucking cash out of the bar.

905
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,500
Cart,

906
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,380
bartender doings,

907
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,530
not making eye contact
every and their pat.

908
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:33,520
Everyone just lets it happen.

909
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,300
It's the mob.

910
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,070
They ran everything in Russia.

911
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,730
Everything.

912
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,210
Wow.

913
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,750
And so we get done and we go back to
our room and it's a totally different

914
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:41,140
energy,

915
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,780
like very like very sketchy,

916
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,220
you know?

917
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,630
And,

918
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,431
and he freaked out.

919
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,211
Now I'm free talks.

920
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:46,511
I'm like,

921
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:46,870
fuck,

922
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,850
I just robbed the car like no
one else saw anyone rubbed.

923
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,860
The bark are except for me and my teacher,

924
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:51,340
Val,

925
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,900
who's at the time was our chaperone,

926
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,920
didn't speak any Russian.

927
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,390
She comes to our first class cart,

928
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,250
opens the door and says,

929
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:58,480
I need to talk to you right now.

930
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,860
And I was like,

931
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:00,161
listen,

932
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:00,491
and she goes,

933
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:02,410
I told you that you're in big trouble.

934
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:03,590
You I my classmate,

935
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,160
your classmates that told me what happened
big where it takes a sip of vodka,

936
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:07,240
spits in her eyes and goes,

937
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,800
no one talks to the machine like that.

938
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,491
I'm like,

939
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:10,330
whoa.

940
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:12,370
He spit vodka in her eyes,

941
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,200
fucking it is and the,

942
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,660
and then shuts the door and
then it looks at me and he says,

943
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:17,410
don't worry,

944
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,243
I got you.

945
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,940
When it gets dark,

946
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:22,120
we're going to have a lot of
fun and he pulls out a thing,

947
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:22,720
a keys.

948
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,280
He's got keys to the whole fucking train.

949
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,790
He's like,

950
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,200
we're going to rob everyone when the,

951
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,910
when it gets dark now I'm like,

952
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:28,451
fuck,

953
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:30,130
why did I get myself into like,

954
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,060
this is bad news,

955
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,080
bad fucking news.

956
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:34,660
So we get stark and sure enough,

957
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:35,620
then we start robbing the train.

958
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,820
Go through my class first.

959
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,290
We'd fucking open the door.

960
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,310
Literally Norma crawl in,

961
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,180
pull the bags out.

962
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,240
John and I would go through them and
try not to steal like anything important

963
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,770
and Biggie or would stand guard.

964
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:45,880
And if anyone woke up,

965
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,850
he'd take us civil vodka
and spit in their face.

966
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,260
And it was,

967
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,481
I mean,

968
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:51,131
it's sketchy now.

969
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:51,641
It's sketchy.

970
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:52,474
It's not even fun.

971
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,890
These guys aren't fucking,

972
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:54,071
no,

973
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:54,191
no,

974
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:54,341
no.

975
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:54,941
They're loaded though.

976
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,451
They're hammered.

977
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:56,284
Piss drunk.

978
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,120
We rubbed my whole class and then,

979
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:58,720
uh,

980
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,220
and then we end up,

981
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:03,040
they end up taking off and going into
the car and me and John are sitting in,

982
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,600
in the first class car just thinking,

983
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:04,991
we're fucked,

984
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:05,200
man.

985
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,621
We're fucked.

986
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,460
We robbed the train.

987
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,730
We prompt the bar cart and they come
back and they're just fucking angry,

988
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:10,001
drunk,

989
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,200
like piss angry drunk.

990
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,360
We pull in Moscow and my teacher,

991
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:14,040
Val,

992
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,380
uh,

993
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,041
comes to the door,

994
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:15,874
opens it and said,

995
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:16,691
I'm just letting you know,

996
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:17,560
we've called the police.

997
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,431
So it was like,

998
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,240

999
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,230
So Igor,

1000
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:20,651
Igor,

1001
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:21,161

1003
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:21,971
Don't worry.

1004
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:22,511
Fuck the police.

1005
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:23,021
Fuck the police.

1006
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:23,710
This is Russia.

1007
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,880
Who the fuck she thinks she is?

1008
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,840
This isn't America.

1009
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,650
This is Russia.

1010
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,483
We run everything.

1011
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,210
I'm like,

1012
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:28,750
Ugh,

1013
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm going to fucking go to the gulag.

1014
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,653
Sure enough.

1015
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,531
Sure enough,

1016
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:32,920
man,

1017
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,540
the cops are sitting on the,

1018
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,433
on the middle,

1019
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,150
like the middle.

1020
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,100
You know where people get off the train,

1021
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:40,060
that little receiving area.

1022
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,260
My class is sitting there,

1023
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,640
my whole class or in the pajamas,

1024
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:43,390
they're crying.

1025
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,150
Their bags had been gone through their
fucking giving statements to the cops and

1026
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:50,660
the cops are writing them down and I'm
sitting with Igor and Igor and John in

1027
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:53,090
the fucking car and they're just still
drinking and smoking and they're like,

1028
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:53,750
fuck this.

1029
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,141
Fuck this.

1030
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,100
We'll take care of this right now.

1031
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,230
They walk outside out to the cops and
start yelling at the cops and I'm like,

1032
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,083
mother Fucker,

1033
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,700
this is not how I would
have taken care of this.

1034
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,360
Just,

1035
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,751
I don't know.

1036
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:03,680
I don't even know what they're saying,

1037
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:04,491
but they're just shouting in.

1038
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:07,670
The cops are shouting back
and then finally biggie or
just starts pointing at me

1039
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,150
and I'm like,

1040
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,301
oh,

1041
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:09,860
he's been in this whole
fucking thing on me.

1042
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,080
Like I'm going down for the whole thing.

1043
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,020
And then the cop starts pointing at
me and telling me exists as it did.

1044
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,310
It's by the owner or whatever he's saying,

1045
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:17,210
come here right now.

1046
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,950
So I fucking walk out.

1047
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,950
And it's that moment where you
find the hash on your body.

1048
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,110
You know they find it and
you're going to jail forever.

1049
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,380
Is that that moment that walk where
your asshole gets cold and you're like,

1050
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:29,330
this is it that express fucking,

1051
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,193
that's the moment.

1052
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,010
And I'll walk all the way across the
soul fucking trailer to get to him.

1053
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:37,160
I get right up to the cop and
the cop looks at me and he goes,

1054
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,260
I understand you're the machine.

1055
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,191
And I was like,

1056
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:40,341
yeah.

1057
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:40,701
And he goes,

1058
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:41,001
tonight,

1059
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:41,990
you party with us.

1060
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,200
What?

1061
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,520
Right.

1062
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,050
So then we went out and
partied with these cops.

1063
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,400
So the cops did nothing,

1064
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,234
fucking nothing.

1065
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,740
They were so excited to meet the machine.

1066
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,760
What's it really like?

1067
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,291
This fucking,

1068
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:50,811
it was the,

1069
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:51,171
it was,

1070
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:51,671
it was,

1071
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:52,100
it has,

1072
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,040
it was a nickname there
no one funny in Russia.

1073
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,903
Is that what it is?

1074
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,451
No,

1075
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:56,990
there was no,

1076
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,890
there was no humor.

1077
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,480
There was no with you.

1078
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,441
Is that what it is?

1079
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:00,671
Is,

1080
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:01,520
is no one funny.

1081
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:03,140
And then you come along
and you're hilarious.

1082
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:03,561
So they were like,

1083
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:04,370
we're partying with you.

1084
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:04,551
Yeah.

1085
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:04,851
And I was,

1086
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:05,750
and I was just loud.

1087
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,280
Like there's not a lot
of Lao people like you.

1088
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:10,400
Would you be willing to move to
Russia to be their bitch and to like,

1089
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,190
Nah Dude,

1090
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,820
those guys scared me one night.

1091
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,770
The guy did you party with these guys?

1092
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,230
Oh,

1093
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,080
I party with Igor.

1094
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:18,290
And you were on the train only.

1095
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,010
And then I partied with the cops in Moscow
with John and then for one night and

1096
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,870
then we hid from them cause they want it.

1097
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,090
They like the cops wanted,

1098
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,040
uh,

1099
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,400
the cops were ski were scary.

1100
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,410
More scary than the
gangsters because they,

1101
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:30,740
you,

1102
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,850
they could not get in trouble.

1103
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,531
Like they either were like,

1104
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,760
drive my cop car and you're like,

1105
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,900
what the fuck drive my cop cost.

1106
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,430
Fucking do they drive on the
left side of the same side as us?

1107
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,120
Uh,

1108
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,990
I don't remember.

1109
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,640
I was there for three months.

1110
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:44,474
You'd think I'd know.

1111
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,381
I have no idea.

1112
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:47,120
I was drawing on the same side as us,

1113
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,841
but they,

1114
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:48,440
but they,

1115
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,100
I mean like the whole experience
in Russia was just amuse.

1116
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,790
Just,

1117
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,780
I remember one time we,

1118
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,830
Igor and you're going to,

1119
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:59,030
Sasha had said they were going to get a
boat for us for Russian may day or Labor

1120
00:25:59,031 --> 00:25:59,660
Day.

1121
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,201
And they're like,

1122
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:00,291
yeah,

1123
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:00,680
we got to,

1124
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,513
um,

1125
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,460
they're going to have a big
boat for our whole class.

1126
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:05,390
We're all going out in the boat.

1127
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,070
So I get up early for the day,

1128
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:10,160
we're going out on the boat and I go
over to his room and Igor is eating dried

1129
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:10,461
fish,

1130
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:11,600
drinking beers.

1131
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,591
And I was like,

1132
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:12,980
what's better?

1133
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,281
And he's like,

1134
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm fucked.

1135
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,151
I go,

1136
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:14,271
what?

1137
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:14,511
And he goes,

1138
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:15,344
we got no boat.

1139
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:15,711
Like,

1140
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:16,101
what do you mean?

1141
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:16,311
He goes,

1142
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:16,630
I've,

1143
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,900
I've tried everything
to try to get a boat.

1144
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,890
I can't get a fucking boat.

1145
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,790
And we've promised the class of boat
for the tour is supposed to have a boat.

1146
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:23,691
And so we're like,

1147
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:24,171
oh fuck.

1148
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:24,531
And he goes,

1149
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:26,270
and then all the sudden the
phone rings and he goes,

1150
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,133
we got a boat.

1151
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:27,891
I go,

1152
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:28,400
we do.

1153
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,671
And he goes,

1154
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:29,180
yeah.

1155
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,950
So we start walking to the dock,

1156
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,540
we're carrying a fucking big case of beer,

1157
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,770
my whole class cameras and fucking to
their little passports around their neck.

1158
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,660
And one of his buddies just
walks up and he's like,

1159
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:39,171
hey.

1160
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:39,501
And he's like,

1161
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:40,334
hey.

1162
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,710
And then we just get to the dock and
there's a boat there and we get on it and

1163
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:44,544
take off.

1164
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,960
And halfway through we realize like,

1165
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,070
I just stole the fucking boat.

1166
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,690
He just stole the boat.

1167
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:52,200
And he was like rushing
must be just fucking crazy.

1168
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:53,040
Insane.

1169
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,800
We went to,

1170
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,750
went to a big mob boss party
one night and he was like,

1171
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:58,410
tells them my boss.

1172
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:58,860
He goes,

1173
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,641
this is the machine,

1174
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,920
this is the guy who does this all happen.

1175
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,761
It just was loud.

1176
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:03,090
And then,

1177
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,770
and then I was partying with Eagle
and Sasha so much that like that.

1178
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:10,080
And they just tell their friends
or you gotta meet this guy,

1179
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,951
you gotta meet this guy.

1180
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:11,784
He's so funny.

1181
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,240
We're going to have to drink with you
and then we're going to do shots with

1182
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:15,990
Brooke crusher.

1183
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,651
You gotta be careful,

1184
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:17,040
man.

1185
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,710
You were selling yourself
as this incredible fun party
guy and everyone's going

1186
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:22,560
to want to do shots with you.

1187
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:22,721
Oh,

1188
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:23,071
I don't,

1189
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:23,311
I'm,

1190
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:24,144
I'm fucking,

1191
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,980
are you friends with Igor on Facebook now?

1192
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:26,210
Have you?

1193
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,080
I tried to find him a lot.

1194
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,310
I follow you on Twitter.

1195
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,280
It's really fascinating.

1196
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,470
And,

1197
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,390
and like their stories.

1198
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:33,230
I had to put in the book,

1199
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:34,610
I had to put the machine in.

1200
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,620
I can't not write that in there.

1201
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,281
And there's a lot of,

1202
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,690
there's like the Will Smith Story.

1203
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,680
I had to put it in,

1204
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,210
but then I wanted to do
the cerebral palsy one.

1205
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,840
I wanted to do one where I met Ralph
Sampson and when I was a kid I was,

1206
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,800
I got off Thompson.

1207
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,000
Um,

1208
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,430
he was a basketball player and I was,

1209
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,400
I went to school at,

1210
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,240
I went to,

1211
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,730
I was like in eighth grade I decided I
really want to be a basketball player and

1212
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:57,731
so I went to Villanova basketball camp
and Ralph Sampson came to speak and like

1213
00:27:57,891 --> 00:28:01,610
the first night I got a concussion and
the two best basketball players got

1214
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:02,780
pulled out for drinking.

1215
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,050
So the next day I had to sit out with two
that's basketball players and everyone

1216
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,040
thought we drank together.

1217
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,140
So now all of a sudden I'm 15,

1218
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,380
14 and everyone thinks I'm cool because
I'm partying with the 18 year olds.

1219
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,790
So Ralph Sampson comes,

1220
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,840
I thought this defined me.

1221
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,730
Ralph Sampson comes up to give a speech.

1222
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:17,031
He's like,

1223
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:19,550
I'm here to talk to you about two things.

1224
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,010
There's 5,000 kids on the gym floor.

1225
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,491
He said,

1226
00:28:22,491 --> 00:28:25,760
we were talking about basketball and
we're talking about discipline first let's

1227
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:26,571
talk about discipline.

1228
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:26,961
Who in here?

1229
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:27,560
Parties.

1230
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,500
And I was under the impression we
were all going to put our hands up,

1231
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,300
but I was the only fucking person.

1232
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,400
I just went trunk and he was like,

1233
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:34,581
oh,

1234
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:35,600
one person,

1235
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,561
5,000 kids.

1236
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:37,700
No one raised her fucking hand.

1237
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,301
He's like,

1238
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,080
how do you party?

1239
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,000
I was fucking 13 I know how to,

1240
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:41,750
I didn't,

1241
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,620
I never partied in my life.

1242
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:46,670
So all I said was hardy
and he fucking lost it.

1243
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,860
And 5,000 kids are slapping the gym floor.

1244
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:49,580
Like,

1245
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,540
Oh shit,

1246
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,010
we're going to make an example out of you.

1247
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:52,611
Party animal.

1248
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:53,660
He's lost the room.

1249
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,830
So he brings me up front to the in front
of all the kids and he makes me stand

1250
00:28:57,831 --> 00:29:01,070
up and he puts a basketball
behind my legs like this.

1251
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,200
And then one on my arms like this.

1252
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,341
And he's like,

1253
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:05,200
we party hardy.

1254
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:05,331
What?

1255
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:06,500
We're going to party hardy today.

1256
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,240
So I'm standing like this for his whole
fucking hour speech with basketball here

1257
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:11,631
and there.

1258
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:12,464
And he's like,

1259
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,670
and he keeps coming back to me.

1260
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,601
And by the way,

1261
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:17,690
I'm so in my head that I
have social anxiety disorder,

1262
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:20,600
but I'm in front of everyone
and I'm like being made fun.

1263
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,210
I'm being mocked that I wasn't
listening to his question.

1264
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:24,044
Somebody was like,

1265
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,880
you think you'll ever party again?

1266
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,421
I just said,

1267
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:27,254
yeah,

1268
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,810
and the fucking place went bananas.

1269
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,673
They're like,

1270
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,161
oh.

1271
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:31,521
And he's like,

1272
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,360
how do you party hardy?

1273
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:32,830
I was like,

1274
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,890
and I didn't know the answer.

1275
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:34,640
I just was like,

1276
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,473
with two hands,

1277
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,340
fucking people are losing.

1278
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,310
You think you do marijuana
and now I'm killing it.

1279
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:39,740
I'm like,

1280
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,370
I'll get to in college and these kids,

1281
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,670
I left that gym and everyone
wanted to talk to me.

1282
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,900
Everyone's like party animal.

1283
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:50,170
What are you doing and that you're still
holding the basketball between your

1284
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:51,960
legs the whole fucking time.

1285
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,220
You're cracking jokes
while I'm cracking jokes.

1286
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,510
And how long did you hold the basketball?

1287
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,393
An hour.

1288
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,050
That's a long time by my cousin
Abe almost brought him here today.

1289
00:29:59,051 --> 00:29:59,411
I should have,

1290
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:00,250
I didn't even think about it.

1291
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:03,340
My cousin aid was there at the
camp even cause he's from Philly.

1292
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,203
I didn't know anyone.

1293
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:04,961
My cousin,

1294
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:05,710
he was like,

1295
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,130
I didn't,

1296
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:06,910
I didn't know you partied.

1297
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,091
I go,

1298
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:07,924
I don't,

1299
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,280
I don't.

1300
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,170
I just thought we'd all
put our fucking hands up.

1301
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:11,981
He's like,

1302
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:12,161
no.

1303
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,480
Why would you put your
hands up if you don't party?

1304
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:13,781
I was like,

1305
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:14,680
I want it to be cool.

1306
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,180
So yeah,

1307
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,000
so like so now and then everyone
would come up and they'd be like,

1308
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:19,481
party animal,

1309
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:20,314
you partying harder.

1310
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,191
I'd be like,

1311
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:22,024
yeah.

1312
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,110
But then I became cool at that camp and
then I have friends and so I wrote that

1313
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,880
story is a little longer
and I gave it to them.

1314
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:28,390
I go,

1315
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,380
this is the best story.

1316
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:30,280
This defines me.

1317
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,420
And they're like,

1318
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,950
oh I'm not really.

1319
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,240
That's hilarious.

1320
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,650
So it's all partying stories,

1321
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:37,600
but it's like that's a hilarious story.

1322
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,523
Oh thanks.

1323
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,580
Oh nutty.

1324
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,080
That this could have possibly sent you
on a path when you were that young.

1325
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:44,490
Yeah.

1326
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,580
Know 13 years old.

1327
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:45,940
I just,

1328
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,330
I,

1329
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,160
and it's all just wanting to be accepted.

1330
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:48,730
I remember.

1331
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,920
Did you ever have one of those moments
where you'd go somewhere and you didn't

1332
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:51,670
know anybody?

1333
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,060
Sure.

1334
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,070
But you felt like everyone
fucking grew up together.

1335
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,581
Yeah.

1336
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:55,450
That's a weird feeling.

1337
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,340
I felt like that a lot as a kid.

1338
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:57,760
Yeah.

1339
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,230
But I thought that that define me.

1340
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:00,800
Cause then I became the Po.

1341
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,500
I became the party animal that
kind of lived up to whatever I,

1342
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:04,931
by the way,

1343
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,190
I went to high school the very next year.

1344
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:07,060
It didn't know anyone,

1345
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,440
so I'm sure that kind of,

1346
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:08,771
I was like,

1347
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:08,980
well,

1348
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,090
it worked in Villanova,

1349
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,583
so

1350
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,570
[inaudible]

1351
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,930
okay.
