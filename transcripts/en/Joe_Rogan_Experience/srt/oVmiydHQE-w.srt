1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello bitches honey,

2
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:03,951
y'all.

3
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:05,740
Yaz is tiny gentlemen.

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,220
He didn't meet,

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,940
I think he used to fight at
one 35 now he's won 25 right?

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,800
Isn't honey at one 30 he's the one 35
or one 25 not the biggest guy in the

7
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:15,250
world.

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,150
Find out what way it is.

9
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,050
I think he's a flyweight.

10
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,700
Now I might be wrong,

11
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,953
but anyway,

12
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,220
it doesn't look like a bodybuilder.

13
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,540
Anytime.

14
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,010
Oh,

15
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,880
dos Anjos caught him with that left high
kick and that's what I'm talking about.

16
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,714
Like he can,

17
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,673
he can add in.

18
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,391
Oh,

19
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,690
you don't know Jesus Christ.

20
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,311
Oh,

21
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:33,731
Jesus.

22
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:34,564
Fucking Christ.

23
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,513
Oh Jesus.

24
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,911
Oh Jesus.

25
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,560
Fucking Christ Jesus.

26
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,281
Oh Jesus.

27
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:41,740
He's going to win Jesus fucking Christ.

28
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh my God.

29
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,110
Oh my God.

30
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,993
Jesus.

31
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,040
This is fucking tremendous.

32
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,130

36
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,240

39
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,620
Oh yeah,

40
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,730
but he don't know where he is.

41
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,563
He doesn't know.

42
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:01,923
He doesn't know.

43
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,840
He doesn't know who he is.

44
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,540
This is hard and gets fucking skill.

45
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,990
Sakis I've been waiting

47
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,140
This is what I'm talking about.

48
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,570
This is what the fucking
problem is looking at you.

49
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,810
Every once in a while
you run into a brick.

50
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:19,644
Fuck the wall.

51
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,350
This Guy Diaz the fuck they did.

00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:23,184

00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,203
Get over.

56
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,600
There's a new 55 where
it's got to McGregor now.

57
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,130
Where's kind of the Gregor?

62
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,550
This is crazy.

63
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,361
I told you,

64
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:44,980
this is the fight of the bucket here.

65
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,370

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,793

God Damn Eddie Alvarez.

69
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,250
I told you I was excited
when you called me.

70
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,410
This is the fucking fight of the year.

71
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,280
Cock suckers.

72
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:05,390

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,191
She says,

75
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,390
I've got an anxiety attack.

76
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,830
He looks fantastic.

77
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,480
What I'm fucking talking about.

78
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,490
That was spectacular,

79
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:13,671

80
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:14,930

82
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:17,780

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,240
Boom.

84
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,620
That right hand landed there.

85
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,660
I think the legs go,

86
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,010
Oh shit.

87
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,181
Boom,

88
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:23,541

89
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,230
boom.

90
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,063
Still again.

91
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,980
Wham.

92
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,770
O He snuck it in right over the guard.

93
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,201
Oh,

94
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,210
we did the chicken dance.

95
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,430
I'll tell you what dos Anjos,

96
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,840
he weathered a fucking dollar store.

97
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,150
None for those sign.

98
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,990
Use a fucking savage to Conor McGregor.

99
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,360
You better pack a lunch if you want
to fuck with these motherfuckers.

100
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,800
These motherfuckers told
you this is the deck five.

101
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,180
Oh my God.

102
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:48,871
Eddie Alvarez.

103
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:49,810
Look at these common

104
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,750
Merica fuck you when you're dumped.

105
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:55,950
Fight smart content.

106
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:56,960
Nitrous but the pocket.

107
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,003
Wow.

108
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,340
This was at Joe Rogan is boy Mark Henry.

109
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:03,160
That guy is one of the
best coaches in MMA today.

110
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,420
Dude from new geography.

111
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,470
Suck my deck.

112
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,590
You'll walk when you're fucking
machines and your bullshit.

113
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,300
I'm paid some fucking dude.

114
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
Suck my Dick.

115
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,660
And his other client was Frankie Edgar,

116
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,853
but heart,

117
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,660
they show up with nothing but hard.

118
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,643
Yup.

119
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,520
And I'm a big fan of Henry's big fan.

120
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,750
Fucking tremendous

121
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,350
winner by Tko new one 50
are you fucking kidding me?

122
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,560
This just throws a tremendous
wrench into everything now.

123
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,120
Well you know what else it does?

124
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,880
It lets everybody know
how fucking God damn good.

125
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:43,860
Michael Chandler and I
told you on the phone,

126
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:44,311
Joe Rogan,

127
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:44,881
he came in,

128
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:45,750
he looked through bots.

129
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:48,240
The first fight he bugged Gilbert,

130
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,141
the other guy.

131
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,410
All the first five is
a slow fucking starter.

132
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:52,470
It's over now.

133
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,210
It's over now.

134
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,571
Well,

135
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:55,590
the first fight,

136
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,431
a lot of pressure.

137
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,210
First of all,

138
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,510
you know,

139
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,590
first fight in the UFC,

140
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:59,810
his career's on the line,

141
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,121
you know,

142
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:02,370
leaves Bella tour as a champion.

143
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,970
But it shows you how good do you see
how good Michael Chandler looked in his

144
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:06,804
last fight?

145
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,210
They,

146
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,850
these two had wars over
and star wars and Chandler,

147
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:12,510
uh,

148
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,580
just knocked out pit
bull in the first round.

149
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,521
Damn.

150
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,420
Eddie Alvarez look good.

151
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,800
I looked fucking tremendous.

152
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,820
I've got an anxiety attack.

153
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,654
Joe Rohde.

154
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,613
What's my guys?

155
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,850
What we're saying like the Eddie
Alvarez is the kind of guy occasion.

156
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,490
This is the shit we forgotten.

157
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,324
There's no,

158
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,420
you'll see tattoos on him
or a gold P and was at that

159
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,890
mother fucker all fucking hot.

160
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,940
And the animal man,

161
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,590
he hits hard to look at that.

162
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,310
Boom.

163
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,210
Oh Shit.

164
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,940
Oh Shit.

165
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,250
Dos Anjos took some,

166
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,710
Nah,

167
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,151
they'll sign.

168
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:49,390
Yes.

169
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,060
Oh my God.

170
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,680
Anybody else would have went down by now.

171
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,860
20 guys would have went down by now.

172
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,540
Fucking Eddie Alvarez.

173
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,360
He's a good dude.

174

184
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,941

00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:22,350
so he'll be back now sets up some
interesting folks though that being gone,

188
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,180
I now you got this,

189
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,970
this,

190
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,100
this throws a monkey
wrench into everything,

191
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,570
but you ain't beating this kid.

192
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,330
You Ain't beating this kid for
the next two or three fights.

193
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,930
Alvarez.

194
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,141
Yeah,

195
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:32,831
you ain't beating him.

196
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:34,420
This kid is a fucking Philadelphia guy.

197
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,010
He's been eating pizza for 20 years.

198
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,700
He's done.

199
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,990
You're going to give him a lobster tail,

200
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,963
docking lights out,

201
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,391
lights out,

202
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,224
pitch.

203
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,510
I wonder if he gets a number.

204
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,130
Give Madoff gets a shot at him next.

205
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,570
I wonder if that's what they set up.

206
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,920
You know,

207
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,080
it's hard to deny Nima
Grumet off his shot.

208
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,680
He's undefeated and he's
the number one contender.

209
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,410
This showroom.

210
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,270
This is beautiful.

211
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:57,920

213
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,481

214
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:00,170
man.

215
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,640
And he saw him do that chicken dance.

216
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,070
That's crazy that he didn't go down,

217
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:04,340
man.

218
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,580

00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,350
bombs.

224
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,550
This is fucking Carlos condit
jr he got hit with bombs.

225
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,320
He's just teeing off on him.

226
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,990

business right there.

227
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,350

253
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,310
You hang out with your boys and drink
non gluten and he loses his shit.

254
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,153
