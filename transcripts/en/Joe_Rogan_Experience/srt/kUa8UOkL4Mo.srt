1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,950
Here we go. Four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,170
Boom. And we'll live cat. How are you? I'm
good. How are you? Good to see you here.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,660
Thanks for having me. My
pleasure. My pleasure.

4
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,850
I'm looking forward to talking to
you for a while. I know it's, uh,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,610
I feel like been a long time coming.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,260
I don't even know how much
time we have affiliate.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,430
There's a hell of a lot to catch up on.
Yeah, there's a lot to talk about. Always.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,430
You're a getting ready for Boise. That's
your, uh, your next fine pleats fighting.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,290
I'm Marijn renowned, um, July 14th,
the end, the century link arena.

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,790
Now you took, you took a
good stretch off, right?

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,270
A couple of times. Yeah, a
couple of times. I, um, let's
see. After I fought Meesha,

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,770
I blew my knee and then
the world exploded in.

13
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:50,240
So I had I think 18 months off
between that and fighting, uh, Amanda.

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,880
And then after I fought Amanda,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,750
I saw Amanda was like September 27,
something like that.

16
00:00:56,751 --> 00:01:01,100
And I fought Ronda February 28th.
And then after Ronda,

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,860
uh,
took another big stretch off,

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,360
fought Juliana the following year,
July 9th,

19
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:10,490
and then this was another big stretch off.
So yeah,

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,640
it's been a little bit scattered,
but doing what I can.

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,700
Yeah, you are, you are doing
some crazy therapy to write some,

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,010
some interesting stuff down in San Diego.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,840
Yeah. So, um, there's, there's been
a few things I've been working on,

24
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:28,670
like I'm not a huge fan of
western medicine, you know,
like, uh, even, I mean,

25
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,550
you can call it alternative medicine.
It's like original medicine. I,

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,540
I appreciate looking at things like that
way more than, you know, big farm. But I,

27
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:40,070
uh, you know, one thing that, um,
you know, fighting has gotten me and,

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,100
and stuff with, you know, I think
it's more prevalent in women,

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,380
although I'm thinking it's
happening with men too,

30
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:48,980
is like our endocrine systems are not
happy with these weight cuts and they're

31
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:52,980
not happy with us. Like getting hit in
the head a lot of go figure. Right? Yeah.

32
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,310
So, um, you know, within all
of that I've just, you know,

33
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:01,550
had medical problems and things that
like I'm constantly working on and I feel

34
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:04,400
really good. I'm, I'm
constantly improving. But, um,

35
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,880
one thing I was feeling a
little bit stuck on was a wine,

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,790
I like some of the endocrine problem
issues, but, um, like I dunno,

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,520
I, I had, uh, had I went
to this facility in,

38
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:21,740
in San Diego is called, um,
Dang, why can't I remember, oh,

39
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:26,680
a mindset. And actually the UFC sent
me there because I mean, we have Usada,

40
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,260
we have all of these things
like, um, after fighting Amanda,

41
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,900
I got my head pounded for a
good four minutes there. Um,

42
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,640
I had a Tbi afterwards,
so that was like, uh,

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,280
immediately lowered my,
a estrogen lured my da ta,

44
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,310
my testosterone and I'm hypo thyroid.
Like I will always be hyperthyroid now.

45
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:50,360
Like I have to that fight. Yeah. Yeah.
And um, you know, still toughed it out.

46
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:54,170
So it was trying to do what I could
to go and fight Ronda as soon as I did

47
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:55,280
afterwards. And, you know,

48
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:58,850
part of my game plan is don't
get hit and which means like,

49
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,990
let's just dart out her and see
what happens. You know? So what,

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,820
that's what happens when you do that.

51
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,640
No, Tbi is traumatic brain injury just
in case if someone is listening to this

52
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:11,490
doesn't understand what we're talking
about. And then in the Rhonda fight,

53
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,570
if people don't know about that,

54
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:15,290
you just charged after and he got caught
in an arm bar and like, what was it?

55
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,370
Very quick,

56
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,160
14, 13, 14 sayings. But I did hit
her with a knee. I did throw her ass,

57
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,510
but she practiced a little Ninja
move and comedy alarm and it was,

58
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,610
it was over, you know, but I mean
even even her coaches were like,

59
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,780
you did what you're supposed to do there.
And She just got you. You know? So, um,

60
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,590
that would be an awesome fight to be
able to revisit one day as she even said

61
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:43,560
we'd do it. I mean, who knows her career
so open right now. She need to really,

62
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,480
I don't think she wants to.
I think,

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,740
I mean, who knows? You'd have to ask her,

64
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:54,200
but there's a lot of
lessons to be learned.

65
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:59,201
And what happened to her in terms of like
all of the distractions and Hollywood

66
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:04,250
came calling and there were scripts and
talk about doing road house and there

67
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:09,010
was all this, all this shit going on.
There was other than fighting, you know,

68
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,150
and then it was also,
look,

69
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:15,530
the sport has evolved so
rapidly in the women's,

70
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,060
women's MMA has gotten so high
level so quickly. And if you,

71
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,110
I'm sure you saw a man to his last
fight with Raquel Pennington, I'm like,

72
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:27,960
Holy Shit.
I mean that was a fucking,

73
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:32,150
the high level performance
from her and five rounds,

74
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,260
super high cardio, just put a
beating down and Raquel painting,

75
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:38,900
it's one of the toughest
girls in the world for sure.

76
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,230
Right? I do like, I mean I'm curious,

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,110
I was saying the same thing as the
fights going. Right. And then I have, uh,

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,080
some people in my ear next to me,
they're like,

79
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,670
well how long has it been since we're cal?
Fuck,

80
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,500
cause she didn't look her
or like [inaudible] she,
she looked a little tired.

81
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,960
She looked a little like not
her typical and then it's,

82
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,590
it's like she's a year and
a half off herself. Right.

83
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,670
Like right into a title fight,

84
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:05,410
which I have to say I'm a little bit
envious of because when I beat Misha,

85
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,800
I, when, uh, I was supposed
to coach ultimate fighter,

86
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,880
but that was all ultimately going to
end up in a title shot with Rhonda and I

87
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:17,881
blew my knee and my husband passed away
and there was like a long moment of

88
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,560
silence in there. And then when I was
able to come back, they made me read,

89
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,750
earn my title shot, you know? And so it
was like, wait, oh, we're doing that now.

90
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:26,584
Or just like

91
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,950
what would attractive
contenders are available.

92
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,130
Yeah, it looks good. I agree. Yeah.
I mean it was very young at that,

93
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,000
at that age or at that at the time.

94
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,440
Right. And in Bantam weight
right now there's like,

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,180
there's no standout contender and Raquel
had beaten some really good fighters

96
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:47,900
and she looked like the next in line.
And did she blow her knee out as well?

97
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,970
I want to say she got
like, Oh, I could be lying,

98
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:54,580
but I think she got like some
accident with a four wheeler,

99
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,320
like rolled over and broke
her leg or something.

100
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,270
I could like totally be
making that up though.

101
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:02,220
She could have just twisted it walking
down the street too. So I don't know.

102
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,620
Yeah. Now that you're saying that,
I do remember something like a Bro,

103
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,260
a broken leg, Jamie, you'll
find out what it is. Um,

104
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,030
but were you a,
were you surprised by that fight

105
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,900
between Raquel and Amanda?
Yeah, I mean, I didn't,

106
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,660
I didn't see where cal being the
one to beat her, you know. Um,

107
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,450
I do feel like Amanda's been working and
doing like, you know, improving, I mean,

108
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:29,730
she changed her camps.
The coaches that she's working with.

109
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:30,930
I tried out for a while at,

110
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,960
at one point too when I was trying
to find my spot and they're legit.

111
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,670
They're very good.
Um,

112
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,760
and American top team has a lot
of high level training partners,

113
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,870
both girls and guys, you know
what I mean? She had a good, uh,

114
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,130
a good decision made there. So
I, I see how she's improved. Um,

115
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,750
I think with the time off with Raquel,
I wasn't sure how it was going to go,

116
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:51,030
but also I just,
I just don't know.

117
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:53,940
I just don't see Raquel being to
be being the one that beats her.

118
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,120
It's so hard to tell
you no, right. I mean,

119
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,850
anybody on any given night at the
highest level, the game someone can,

120
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:02,940
when someone can be off,
someone can be a hard, yeah,

121
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,540
there's no math to be done in this sport.
There really isn't a,

122
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,940
math is ridiculous. So, I mean,

123
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:12,470
sometimes I hear like statistics on me
or definitions on me or labels on me and

124
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:16,460
I'm like, wait, I'm a,
I'm a known striker. Like,

125
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,860
I'd never would've thought I'd
be known as a striker. I mean,

126
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:22,070
I've been doing Jujitsu and wrestling
my whole life slog me and I'll take it.

127
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:26,780
Fuck yeah. You know? Yeah,
yeah, yeah. But even that is,

128
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,200
yes. But I mean that,
that in itself was like,

129
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,860
I love to wrestle and what can I
do once I've closed that distance?

130
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,470
While it's those, those short and
goals strikes, you know, there's,

131
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,800
there's needs and there's elbows there
that those are the most destructive

132
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,440
things I could possibly do to
someone when, when we're that close.

133
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,770
And to do all that work to get that close.
But granted,

134
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:49,160
that's all influenced by my time, what
I got to learn from that discipline. So,

135
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,510
you know, it's all relevant,
but um, you know, it's, uh,

136
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,220
it's always just interesting to hear
how you're now being categorized.

137
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,710
Yeah, it is weird. Right? But you are,
you are definitely a dangerous striker.

138
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,300
I mean,
you're dangerous.

139
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,190
I agree. I mean, I like it and, and I'm,

140
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,030
I'm enjoying constantly learning
and new things like the,

141
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,810
the basics were always hard for me to
get cause I wanted to do the big girl

142
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:18,080
stuff, you know, and uh,
you know, found my way,

143
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,650
like right in the middle of all of that.
And,

144
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:22,190
and find a way to use how
aggressive I am and how,

145
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:26,570
just like Dominique domineering, I can
feel in there and all of that. So it's,

146
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,090
it's like, I don't know, the,

147
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,750
I want the maximum amount of
damage without taking damage,

148
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:37,070
which is obviously the goal. Right.
But like I want to put it into a dance,

149
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:39,200
so it's like a little,
I don't know.

150
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,130
What made you decide to go to San
Diego? So you were at alliance now? Um,

151
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,330
moved from Colorado to San Diego.

152
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,620
A few things. So one of
them, one of them was like,

153
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:54,180
Colorado is a complicated situation for
me. I mean, I had gyms that they're like,

154
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,120
a lot just happened up there.
Um,

155
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,220
and I love my team elevation. Like I
love ice. I'm still close with everybody.

156
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:06,120
Like I go to Colorado for Christmas
holidays, I get still home, you know,

157
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:09,270
but a couple of things. One
with the head injury. Um,

158
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:12,640
Colorado is amazing for training,
right? It's amazing for building your,

159
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:15,540
your endurance and whatever.
But it is not good for healing.

160
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,810
Like you'll never see a doctor tell
someone with Alzheimer's or a Tbi or heart

161
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:26,040
problems or even like massive
allergies or um, what's the,

162
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,190
uh,
arthritis arthritis like those are not,

163
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,350
that's not a good place
for people to live with.

164
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:35,640
Any kind of inflammatory or like major
thing that needs to be healing because

165
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,150
your body's already working at
such a high level because yeah,

166
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:42,930
because the altitude, I mean the
thin air, the, the things like that,

167
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:47,931
it's just like I spent so
much time and so much money,

168
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,750
like figuring out what the hell
was wrong with me that, you know,

169
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:56,430
I ended up at the Mayo clinic spending
weeks at a time going to all their like

170
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,640
specialized different,
uh,

171
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,520
doctors and situations like that
for them to tell me like, you know,

172
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:06,000
if you want to heal, you want to give
yourself the best opportunity to hill,

173
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,180
you're probably not going
to do it up at altitude.

174
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,110
Like we would prefer seeing
you at sea level. Um,

175
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,420
so combined like I kind of,

176
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,040
I needed to almost exiled myself from
Colorado cause I want to love it.

177
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,580
And I was starting to, it was starting to
get like less colorful for me, you know,

178
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,750
cause I felt like I had the best there
was as far as coaches and the best there

179
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,560
was as far as training partners and the
situations like everything was as good

180
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:35,880
as it was going to get. Like it literally
was as good as it was going to get.

181
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,240
And it was like this can't be it.
Like I don't feel, I don't feel right.

182
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,110
No. And, and I was like, that means I'm
gonna have to take a change. You know,

183
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,800
when I was scared,
like I have a little boy,

184
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,160
like I'm taking them away from everything
we know and we just packed a u haul

185
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:54,810
and we left and we got to San
Diego in San Diego I went,

186
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,260
I wish I had written down like all the
gyms I went to and showed up at like

187
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,710
anonymously to, because I
didn't want them to, like,

188
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,990
I wanted to kind of catch them
with their pants down. Like,

189
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:07,350
what are you guys like right
now versus if you're prepared,

190
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:09,660
I don't want to show up and have
you have people here watching me.

191
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,220
I don't want you to put on a show,

192
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:15,150
like I want to catch you how you are and
like have you decide what you think of

193
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:18,180
me too. Because these needs,
this needs to be a fit. I mean,

194
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:22,680
fighting and coaching and training is
very intimate and it needs to be authentic

195
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,040
and real. The days I'm sitting there,
ugly white girl crying on the ground,

196
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,350
but I need,
I need you to tell me to keep,

197
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,980
stay on the erudite and you know what I
mean? Like, just let me cry, you know,

198
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,410
that kind of thing. And um, it's, uh,

199
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,490
so I went to all these places and like I,

200
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,790
the best part about it is that I got to
learn and train with so many fighters in

201
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,080
so many coaches that I like.

202
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,460
I'm so excited about the relationships
I made and the people I know. But, um,

203
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,730
like all of them, it was like, this
is awesome, but it's not the place.

204
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,040
This is awesome,
but it's not the place I came up to.

205
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,860
And I was very close to
going to American top team.

206
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,460
They had an awesome deal set up for
me to go, like helping me with my kid,

207
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:05,430
helping me with a good percentage
for training, like how uh,

208
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,850
living situation was going to be, they're
going to accommodate me really well. Um,

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,670
but when it was time to like pack my
car and go like something was like that

210
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,810
wasn't it, you know? And so I'm like,

211
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,900
I mean sweaty all the time,
like right here,

212
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,070
like in that look hot,

213
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,030
there's a lot of cool people in Florida,
but there's just,

214
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,310
there's some subhumans down there.
Yeah. I really appreciate it.

215
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:36,640
Like the Latin culture. I
mean, I'm all about, yeah,

216
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,980
it's Florida.
There's some fucking swamp people though.

217
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:47,800
There is no joke, no joke. Um, so, uh,

218
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,990
then I looked west, you know, um, I know
ed stores out here, he's my manager and,

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,550
and I had it a few pockets of people I
knew that can maybe be a support to me

220
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:59,860
and my kids. So, um, came to
la. If I was here, I was going
to go to the black house.

221
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,210
Uh, I think, um, uh, oh,

222
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,290
where's Kelvin Gastelum train again?
12 and gasoline.

223
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,650
You got to say his name wrong every time.

224
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:12,250
But where is he coached the
MEU ticket kings. Kings,

225
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,090
Kayla's going to kings black house.
And I was still trying to pick Jujitsu.

226
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,700
Like I wanted like a art of
Jujitsu guy or, or uh, you know,

227
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,320
just someone really good.
Yeah,

228
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:27,970
because I came from
traditional traditional
Jujitsu and like I love MMA and

229
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:29,770
mixing it up,
but I need that.

230
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,070
So I felt you were introduced to
purple for like ever like six years.

231
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,590
How come? So long? Because I'm being
a Weirdo about who promotes me.

232
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,700
Cause my husband,

233
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,500
my husband promoted me to probe about
and like I really want what whoever takes

234
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,900
over their lineage to be like that.

235
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,390
Like I don't want it a different
one from 10 different people.

236
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:56,560
Like I want that like I want
to pick and it be right.

237
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:01,330
And so actually now I'm super excited
because I just started training at Aptos

238
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,130
and I have so much respect for
Andre and his wife Angelica.

239
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,220
There's so many good fighters come out
of that gym to Great Jujitsu fighter. I,

240
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,370
I've been changing there
like four weeks now and I've,

241
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:18,130
I mean I've trained there before but like
every day for weeks now and I've only

242
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,250
had like one day where I walked
out feeling like a rock star.

243
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,220
The rest of the days they were whooping
my ass but it was good, you know,

244
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:27,340
like I needed that and it
tells me, you know, yeah.

245
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,680
And there it's just been so good and to
see myself that way and to hold people

246
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:32,921
that way.

247
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,730
Like I was the jit at Jujitsu me and I
was like killing it on the circuit for a

248
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:40,930
long time and then Emma May comes in and
puts this pressure on like even those

249
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:43,510
kinds of competitions, even though
they're not even the same animal.

250
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:47,440
And I'm annoyed that I let that bother
me and keep me from competing in between

251
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:52,160
fights because I loved that name in MMA.
You feel

252
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,100
weird about competing in Jujitsu
tournament? I think I did. I,

253
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,820
or maybe I thought I'd pick up
bad habits or I would do whatever,

254
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:02,690
but because maybe other people had
that experience, but like for me,

255
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:06,380
I need to see it for myself. Like if I
go and I do a tournament and I do great,

256
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,620
then hell yeah, I'm going to have higher
expectations of myself in a fight.

257
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,780
If I go and I do shitty. Okay, well,

258
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,290
like now I get to learn
like that competing is where
I get to learn everything

259
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,060
and spacing out these competitions.

260
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,530
Especially at the time I've had to take
off in between fights. Like I'm not,

261
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,990
I don't believe necessarily in ring rust,

262
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:27,080
but like when they say go,

263
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,150
I don't know what go means until a
little bit later than I'm expecting.

264
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,820
And it's been the pattern
in these last two fights.

265
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,690
You mean when the fight starts, you still
feel like, is this really happening?

266
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,630
Kind of. Well, even this last
night, this last fight with Caitlin,

267
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:44,930
like we got in and I was like, do I
remember what to do here? You know,

268
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:46,820
and I was like, fuck it,
I'm just a throw bombs.

269
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,810
And the whole time I was
just like, and I'm not eat,
that's not me there, you know,

270
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:54,050
it was just like chucking my hands at
her and hoping they land and if they

271
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:58,790
didn't like the fuck out, you know,
you feel like out of composure. Yeah,

272
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,620
until the,
until the third round.

273
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:04,070
And then the third round I was
awake and ready to go. And I mean,

274
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,430
I felt warmed up. I felt
right. And you know,

275
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,890
she was looking at the clock and backing
up and all of this and I was just like,

276
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:13,440
come here, come here. Like I'm ready to
fight finally, like come here. And uh,

277
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,430
you know, I don't know. So there's
something to be fixed about that.

278
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,750
And I don't think it's a
secret, but, um, I dunno.

279
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,170
I think maybe something with the warmup
I need to like fully like have like a

280
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,340
respiratory exhaustion before I go in
so I can simulate those first rounds.

281
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:33,230
Beating the hell out of the way.
Even in wrestling, I don't know.

282
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,170
You know, there's, there's
a lot to it. Like, Gosh,

283
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,770
we're bouncing around all these different
things. But I mean, one thing with the,

284
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,510
with that treatment center that I went
to is like, um, doing different things,

285
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:51,200
like dealing with your psychology, dealing
with like the synchrony in your brain,

286
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,770
you know,

287
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,060
having your brain function and then on
the same hurts at the same or different

288
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:59,810
areas of your brain. What did
they do exactly? So it's therapy.

289
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,730
So it's these magnets, right? Like
the, the main people in there. I mean,

290
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,480
it's beautiful.

291
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Not Beautiful but beautiful to
see sitting in the lobby waiting.

292
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,010
When you see people with
Alzheimer's come in,

293
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,630
like there's a man that wheels his wife
and every day and, and you can't, you can,

294
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,440
I think at the beginning of the week she
gets like an ivy so she's like a little

295
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,930
bit more up and Chipper, but by
the end of the week, you know,

296
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:27,500
she's a little bit more slouch and,
and stories like his,

297
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:31,160
where he's talking about, um, you know,
before they started going in there,

298
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,300
she would just go to the bathroom all
over and every day this man takes care of

299
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,130
his wife,
puts her makeup on her,

300
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,000
like goes and gets her hair done even
though she doesn't even know, you know,

301
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,760
and now she can at least tell him that
she needs to go to the bathroom. Like,

302
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,510
just be like, hey, it's time, you know,
and he can get her there and you know,

303
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,101
sort of,

304
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:53,670
kind of have like meaningful moments
that they haven't had in awhile for,

305
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,940
there's a ton of veterans in there and
active veterans to active military guys

306
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,134
that are,

307
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,410
they're doing these door breaches and
then they get their head rattled up too

308
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,830
many times and they're noticing they have
problems with some depression. I mean,

309
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:10,820
and these are high level
navy seals, high level, like,

310
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:16,230
like special forces that need, um,
need. They're expensive people.

311
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,551
They've,

312
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:19,020
there's millions of dollars poured into
these people and they're not ready to

313
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:21,840
let them go yet. So they're
like, how can we fix them,

314
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,700
give them this like performance edge
but still get them like he like healed

315
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:30,480
enough. But we need, we need to throw them
back in there. We need them, you know?

316
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,440
And so I've had to sit in on appointments
with the Department of Defense in talk

317
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:38,310
about my experience with it. I
had to, uh, I, I don't, I don't,

318
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,180
there's some really famous people I don't
even think I get to say cause I'd be a

319
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:46,620
dick and I'm probably be in trouble, but,
um, that I've sat in on and you know,

320
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:51,420
they've had their own issues
with mental health or PTSD or um,

321
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,210
uh,
they're like autism,

322
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,210
different things like family members of
theirs or whatever that I've sat in on

323
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:01,440
and kind of been helpful in talking
about because I went in there on two

324
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:05,530
different antidepressants. Um, and these,

325
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,270
I was put on at the Mayo Clinic and

326
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,090
felt like post the Nunez. Yeah, this
is how crazy am. I mean math is right.

327
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,040
You lose to Rhonda in 14 seconds.

328
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,530
You Kao Amanda Nunez,

329
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:22,130
Amanda Nunez beats the shit
out of Rhonda and 48 seconds.

330
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,530
That's, that's, you might be like
the perfect example. I'm a math,

331
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,670
you know, and I mean crazy. It's crazy.

332
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,680
I need you beaten down to UFC champion.

333
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,840
Well, in it, I mean, I took, it took
two and a half rounds for me to,

334
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,560
for me to sub Pennington too.
You know,

335
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,340
like there's nothing like,
you know, but who is it?

336
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,300
Pennington goes toe to toe
and round around with Holly.

337
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:52,150
Holly Knox Out Rhonda Too.
Like it's just this division.

338
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,840
His fight with Ashley.
Evan Smith to this day that the ending,

339
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,910
when she got her in that bulldog choke.

340
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,470
Oh Robert and blood and finished
her like literally one second.

341
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,510
It was a violent, crazy. I, I
screamed so loud at the end of that.

342
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:11,840
It was just fucking chaos.
That was, she's done.

343
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,010
She's had two fights that ended like
that with like one second to go.

344
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:20,500
She finishes the fight.
It's tough girl. So the,

345
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,240
anyway, MMA math is
ridiculous. It doesn't work.

346
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,670
And you might be the best example of how
it doesn't work, but so you go to this,

347
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,290
the, the Mayo Clinic puts you
on antidepressants because
you just feel like shit.

348
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:33,810
He like

349
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:38,670
shit. And because like the different
endocrine problems that I had,

350
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,330
right. So I can't have any of the
medications that'll help that.

351
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,340
So I have to be more conservative with it.

352
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:47,710
And one way they thought to
do it is because my cortisol
levels are really high.

353
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,040
They're talking about, um, and I
mean granted I have a lot of stress,

354
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,070
especially like, you know,
life hasn't been easy

355
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,820
fast. Like mom, your husband
passes away toughest,

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,410
probably the toughest sport on the planet,
trying to be the best at it. So yeah,

357
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,150
elite,
you're in the top 10 so you're,

358
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:07,690
you're in this weird position where you
never know when you're going to fire to

359
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,360
who you're going to find.
There's a constant amounts to,

360
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,380
and it's not like you're making
millions of dollars doing it either.

361
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,690
No. Well, and it's
expediting healing for me in,

362
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,940
and I also have a kid going
through what I'm going through,

363
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:20,750
so it's not like I get to like split
and cut corners and just, you know,

364
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:24,920
it's like there's maintenance to be done
at all times with that. So I go there,

365
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,150
they tell me,
you know,

366
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,970
we could probably lower your coders all
levels if we could load or lower your

367
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:32,980
stress levels. So we'll try
it. Antidepressants, what
did that make you feel like?

368
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:38,140
Flat as fuck. And like I didn't get my,
can I say fuck on this? Cause I said okay.

369
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,680
I know, I just didn't know if I have
a quota for, I'm like a bad person.

370
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:45,920
Like did I get handed to like a duck?
It added to a certain level,

371
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,380
zero restrictions. You can say whatever
you want in the shit out of it. Okay.

372
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,250
So got it. Um, so yeah,

373
00:21:55,251 --> 00:21:58,160
they,
they put me on the flat flat,

374
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,720
which like all that training camp
getting ready for Juliana. I'm just like,

375
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,990
I'm like, okay, I'll, it'll,
it'll take off in the fight.

376
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,760
Like I feel good in the fight. Like
when they say no ups, no downs,

377
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,740
no, no pissed off, like want to
kill, you know, nothing, you know,

378
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,580
and not scared but not
happy. No. And I was like,

379
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:22,520
why am I not nervous the way
that I get nervous? Like,

380
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,500
like I was okay, which you usually
like, especially two weeks out,

381
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:30,170
I have this like flesh of
emotions, you know, where I'm like,

382
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:34,660
fetal position in the corner, like
what the fuck? And then once it's over,

383
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:39,230
all I want to do is kill, you know. But,
uh, like, and I didn't have that either.

384
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:43,080
What kind of made me nervous because my,
my other friend buyer pancheck we, she,

385
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,590
she's a new 20 fiver.
Um,

386
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,400
we would always like call each other and
laugh at how dumb we are being at that

387
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,880
point. Like look at me, you know. And uh,

388
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:59,010
but that was all gone with the
shit that they put you on. Um, oh,

389
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:03,980
it was this one. Oh my gosh. Keep going.

390
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,750
PROZAC. What other have,
do you know what I mean?

391
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,040
Jeremy affects her Effexor and stupid

392
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,030
crazy pills twice a day. Just tic tacs.

393
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,500
So they put you on this stuff
and did they try different ones?

394
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,470
Uh,
no because a lot of time there isn't,

395
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,130
you know, and, and they're
looking, I'm like, I need the side,

396
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,300
this side effects matter.

397
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,490
Like these can be ones that
made me gain a bunch of weight.

398
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,660
They can't make me like I need
to still be able to sleep.

399
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:46,010
Like I have to be able to have like
enough highs, lows to be able to

400
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,080
function and learn and,
and whatever.

401
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:51,950
And so this is like the best they
could have for me. So anyway,

402
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,010
I fight that fight with
Juliana. You know, I,

403
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,770
I feel like the first round I
came out how I wanted, you know,

404
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:01,010
and then halfway through the second round,
like it was just awful.

405
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:05,300
Like she had my old coaches in her corner.

406
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,950
You know what's weird about that fight
is I could hear you and I could like, I,

407
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,380
this is where the flat
came in is like I wasn't,

408
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,850
I didn't feel like I was in the fight.

409
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:18,851
Like I could see her beans feet and I
could hear you talking about us and I,

410
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,150
I saw like I could hear Juliana's
coaches and it was breaking my heart.

411
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,430
They were coaching against me because
they were my Colorado gym and she went and

412
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:33,800
trained with them and I know she had
trained with them previously. So I mean,

413
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:38,450
before she had taken the fight. But to me
it was like fucked up to here, you know?

414
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:43,370
And it hurt me in a way, like it's,
I wish I could explain it better,

415
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:46,610
but it was like I heard them and I
just wanted to go home. You know,

416
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,710
I look at the clock and I'm like,
can this just be over?

417
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,230
I don't want to go back to Colorado.
I want to move.

418
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:55,970
Like I literally on this side of the cage,
I had my past in Colorado,

419
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:58,970
I had these coaches, I had the
drama with that, with that Jim,

420
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:01,580
like how everything went and,

421
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,320
and then on this side it was like all
new problems like San Diego, Eric,

422
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,250
and then we're good. Like there was
a lot of training partners there.

423
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:12,110
It was sunny, it was similar to Colorado
at different but in the right ways,

424
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,880
you know? And it was like,
I just wanted it out. Okay.

425
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,400
You were in San Diego trainer for
that fight or no? Yeah, I can't,

426
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,730
I just flew out for it. For, for the
training camp and why you flew out there,

427
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,260
you were still taking the antidepressants
and did that fight convince you to

428
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:27,030
stop taking them?

429
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,890
Yeah. So after that fight
I went to a, what did I do?

430
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:34,320
I think I went to the,
I was at the Pi,

431
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:37,980
I was working with Novinski and
people on like what to do about that.

432
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:42,000
I haven't talked to Gordon.
Dr. Gordon Moore. Gordon. Yeah.

433
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:44,220
To help me with all of that too.

434
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:47,190
Cause he thought there was
a more conservative way to
help me with those issues

435
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:52,160
as well. And so I knew I was talking
with him. I had him talk to them. Uh,

436
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,510
they were all trying to figure out a way,
but still there's like,

437
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,500
there's no way to even just naturally
bring you up. I'm thinking about retiring.

438
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,460
Yeah. And that, that's the thing is the
center was really the place that was,

439
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:06,630
is like, okay, I'm going to go
here. I've tried everything else.

440
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,070
I'm going to go here and if they
can't fix me then, then I'm,

441
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,340
I'm going to have to be done.

442
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,490
How crazy is that?
How fucking hard is Amanda Nunez hit?

443
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,930
It's nuts.
She does it like she,

444
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:20,270
I don't want to say she hits like a dude
cause that's kind of weird, you know.

445
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,700
But, uh, yeah, it's uh,

446
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,350
I remember being surprised.

447
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:30,490
I remember like having this open guard on
the ground and kind of like, come here,

448
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,160
you know, like I dare you. And then
she hit and I was like, Oh, oh,

449
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,250
oh you have those

450
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,370
and that you could see the look on
people's face when she hits him.

451
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:44,350
Like where you saw it
Rhonda like right away. Yeah

452
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,140
there's a part in that fight.

453
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,230
Cause I watched our fight
after and like you, uh,

454
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,930
she hit me and it like did say I think
it's right when it had to be when I hurt

455
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:58,080
my head cause it like drop my
arm and it dropped my neck.

456
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:01,650
And I just remember like seeing like the
little twin eat tweety birds and I was

457
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:04,230
pumped because I was like,
that's where the cartoons get it from.

458
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,410
Cause somebody explained that shit.
That's exactly where they got it.

459
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:10,350
It's like woo. And uh, and my arm,

460
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:14,850
like I couldn't get my arm back up and
I remember listening to you and you're

461
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:18,330
like, cousin not intelligently
defending herself. I'm like, listen Joe,

462
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,120
that fucker won't work.
You know?

463
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:27,840
And then she screwed up
because she grabbed my knee
and my knee was the one that

464
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:30,690
was like the catalyst to all my
problems over the last couple of years.

465
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,590
And it was just like, don't fucking touch
that. And after that it was just like,

466
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,890
I just angry when she grabbed you
in. Yes. Who's the wrong knee?

467
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,280
But I knew what she was
trying to do. Right. Yeah.

468
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,720
And then on top of that it's
like, it's just, I don't know,

469
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,490
the rest of it was just
like punishing her.

470
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:51,960
She's Kinda like Sassy before the
fight anyways. Like in awkward ways,

471
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,080
like not even like cool hypey ways,

472
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,430
like just staring at me really weird in
a room where it was just like me and Tim

473
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,500
Kennedy sitting there eating
like watermelon and stuff
after ins and I look over

474
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:06,300
and she's just like staring at me all
weird. I was like, Damn. Tim's like,

475
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,350
dude, what do we do? I'm like,

476
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:14,070
I can throw out a plate, a watermelon
water. I can throw a table. I don't know.

477
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,850
I don't know what tone we're doing here.
Right.

478
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,650
Wow. When, uh, when you stopped her.

479
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:25,070
We've played the recording
of you screaming like maybe
10 times on this podcast

480
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,530
because to this day,

481
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:33,750
that is one of the Ra's moments
I've ever seen inside the octagon.

482
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,620
Like when you, when you jump, like when
they stopped that fight and you screamed,

483
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,960
it was fucking bone chilling. It was,
it's so, I mean, I'm sure you've heard it,

484
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,650
but that here it is right here.
Play at Jamie.

485
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,130
That's like from your genes. That's
like, that's some cellular level shit.

486
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,760
Yeah, that's intense. Hey

487
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,150
Leaf. It's like I didn't
like, like we lived, you know,

488
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,100
like we lived, they didn't,
we, we get to eat. They don't,

489
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,980
and you know, it's, it's,
it's, it's a relief. It's,

490
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,580
Oh yeah, yeah. I mean you were,

491
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,560
like you said you lived, cause that
was, I mean, look, it's just a fight.

492
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,420
There is a referee,
you're going to be saved.

493
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,660
But one of the things that George Saint
Pierre said last week when he was on the

494
00:29:29,661 --> 00:29:33,800
podcast, he said, the mentality that
you go in there, the way you fight,

495
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:37,400
you are a warrior. Like you, you
know that you're going to be rescued,

496
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,590
but you are fighting for your life.

497
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,170
And when you're fighting a fucking
killer like Amanda and you get lit up,

498
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:48,100
like you didn't survive that first
round and then go back and stop her.

499
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,420
That's where that comes from.
I mean that was just fucking tense.

500
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,230
Well it's the, it's the practicality
to me, right? Like, yes, exactly.

501
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:59,980
We have a referee, we have cage walls,
we have whatever, you know, fans,

502
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,650
it's entertaining people.
But like I need to know,

503
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,300
I need to know that like, well
that'd be a nature, you know,

504
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:09,930
that'd be doing whatever
that be self defense that be,

505
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,900
oh fuck us fighting over a
territory or food or whatever.

506
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:15,730
Like I need to know what would happen.

507
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,220
Like if we had like that's
why I want these finishes.

508
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:22,630
We only get 15 minutes to be able to tell
ourselves what would have happened in

509
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:25,660
that situation. You know? And,
and when it goes to a decision,

510
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:28,630
I'm pissed cause I don't know,
you know, like you don't know,

511
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,760
especially these three round fights where
I'm waking up like these last couple

512
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,410
fights, like late in the fight,
I'm pissed because I'm like,

513
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:39,640
I don't know if that would have been
another 30 minutes or another two hours

514
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:42,520
that we're scrapping in the woods.
Like who gets the bone? You know,

515
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,180
I want to know. And, and so that's, it's,

516
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,770
it's crazy and issue of
practicality and the sheer survival.

517
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,840
And this is the way I get to know myself.

518
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,000
That's deep. Who gets the bone? Ooh.

519
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,230
Damn the way you just put it.
No,

520
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,280
I don't think I've ever heard anybody
put it that way. You need to know.

521
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,770
Yeah, that's intense. But I get it.

522
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,560
I get it. That's where that's
cream comes from. You got the bone.

523
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,420
So you go down to San Diego. What was
your shortlist before, by the way?

524
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,150
I'm a huge fan of, uh, Eric. Uh,

525
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:28,220
alliance is just one of the best camps
for sure. And I think Eric Delphia,

526
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,210
it's like probably one
of the most underrated.

527
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:33,240
And because he doesn't toot his own
horn. Yeah. He's like in the shadows,

528
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,860
laid back, doesn't want any intention.
She's not trying to get any attention.

529
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:42,750
Like he's the last guy to like request
attention, you know, but super,

530
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,510
super knowledgeable and one of
the best guys in a corner too.

531
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,350
Like his advice is always excellent.
I never,

532
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:53,150
never heard him say the wrong thing in
the corner. He's always like on point.

533
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,150
But what was your short list of
places to go to besides the wines?

534
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,430
Um, I went to, did you
go to New Mexico by? Yes,

535
00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:06,880
but I feel like I'm not trying to walk
in on Holly and like make sure weird.

536
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:10,200
Then they were going to fight each other
at some point. I know. And that just,

537
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,550
you know, I don't want to be that guy,
you know? Although I know I'm welcoming.

538
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:16,470
I know that everyone
there always been nice.

539
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:19,380
I've gone and train there
before and it's been good. Um,

540
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,430
but it's just not a
cool move, you know? Um,

541
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,700
I went down to Arizona with crouch.

542
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,870
Loved it there. Another great guy. Yeah.
Great. I feel the same way about him.

543
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,650
He same. Yeah. Very, very,
very humble. Very good.

544
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm super knowledgeable to up in La.
La was cool,

545
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,160
but it was a lot of that

546
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,060
driving around in the
traffic and congestion and I
couldn't sacrifice the like

547
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:49,250
the um, yeah. Is, is so many people here.

548
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,021
Yeah.
And,

549
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:54,530
and coming from Colorado and coming from
like chill out doorsy you can drive 20

550
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:58,940
minutes and be somewhere no one's ever
stood before too, like stuck in traffic,

551
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:00,800
breathing air.
You don't want to breathe like,

552
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,840
like everyone's a little pissed off,

553
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:06,760
but no one really knows why Jan is right.

554
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,050
Jamie's been saying this forever.
Yeah.

555
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,300
Yeah. Where would you go? Maybe
Colorado is so dope. Get their

556
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,140
food culture could be better there.

557
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:25,360
I wish we could combine that food
culture of culture. What do you went to?

558
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,380
I mean, I mean I'm, I'm in a health food.
I mean like ethnic food. I like every,

559
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:34,490
I like, I like trying new stuff all the
time. I'm not very like Food Cheney,

560
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,810
you know, I'm in a fire and meat.
Yeah. Are you are, you know,

561
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:43,250
it's so good. So good. So I've decided

562
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:49,040
I was go for the steak.
First of all, it's a great,

563
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:53,240
I love vegetables, but you can get them
anywhere. I can get them in Colorado.

564
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,020
Not really. I mean it's not exactly
the produce capital of the world,

565
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,940
but you can get them. Yeah. It's not
the best. Yeah. Just get a greenhouse,

566
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,010
grow some tomatoes on my spare
time. Yeah. Did you try Montreal?

567
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,610
Did you think about five
star? I, I did not. Well,

568
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:15,540
I thought about it but um, I don't,
I didn't get up to Canadia. Aye. Aye.

569
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,530
I went to Thailand,
I went to Mexico.

570
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:23,420
I went to you think about
going to Thailand. Yeah. Yeah.

571
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:27,710
I mean when I'm there especially, it's
like such, it's a Buddhist culture.

572
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:31,040
People are so happy.
I mean that you have your shit.

573
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,570
They're just like you have everywhere
else. But at the same time like,

574
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,680
like the Moyie Thai training is good.

575
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,340
I know the places I would go to Jujitsu,

576
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,320
the fair techs and pet TRS is,
is coming around in,

577
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:45,290
in pretty solid.
Like,

578
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:49,430
I've been considered that for this camp
just to kind of like make some changes

579
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,550
cause I really want to have that
influence and that like exposure to the

580
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:55,880
authentic when we tag.

581
00:34:55,881 --> 00:35:00,500
And like when I looked back at my most
successful and most happy times after

582
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,530
these three fights, I've lost three
in a row. Like that doesn't happen.

583
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,920
I'm not saying, you know, I'm like, no,
I'm better than this. Like something's up.

584
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:10,720
And I know there's a lot that I need
to work on. I mean like, uh, my, uh,

585
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,060
my life in general and I'm doing it and
I'm happy to be doing it and I'm happy

586
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:17,270
to be getting the lessons, even if this
is how I have to get him. Like fuck it.

587
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:21,860
At least I know. So, um, I tried
to look back and analyze like,

588
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:24,830
what was I doing when I
was my favorite fighter,

589
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,550
when I was feeling the best and
it was like very traditional,

590
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,160
thick Moitai in very traditional tech,
Jujitsu.

591
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,110
So that this camp has been something that
I'm gonna also be outsourcing because

592
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:38,430
I want to be like that

593
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,760
element. So I'm doing my, I'm doing an
actual Moitai with John Ex. He's uh, uh,

594
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,390
Jeremy Stevens, Muy Thai coach I think
too. And then my Jujitsu with Attos.

595
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,870
And then, cause before it was like I
would do these separate disciplines,

596
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:56,130
put them together and drills and sparring
and then go mango people and then like

597
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:56,761
have fun with it.

598
00:35:56,761 --> 00:36:00,330
Cause it's like these little goals I
had set this little bucket list I would

599
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:04,740
take into a fight with me and try to pull
those things off and that and then go

600
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:07,710
learn new stuff and then go
try to do that. That's why
I was constantly evolving.

601
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:08,490
Every fight,

602
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,060
even the fight with Amanda and I like
snapped her down and I had her by her head

603
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:15,780
and everyone's screaming news
news and like hold my beer.

604
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:20,730
And that's what I go to throw
her with the, you know, the
old, they call it a DDT.

605
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,380
I it wasn't, it was a freestyle like
front headlock suplex but it was like,

606
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,360
like I want, I want every fight to be
different and fun. Like know what I have,

607
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,780
but see what else I got
right thing. And, and that,

608
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,570
that I don't even get to play that right
now because I'm fucking up and I'm,

609
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:41,670
I'm not doing what I want in these fights.
So I decided to take steps backwards.

610
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:45,730
And how do you start and
training and training? I,

611
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,690
I don't know. It, it's something's,

612
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,050
something's been missing and I'm partially
wondering if it's that, you know,

613
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:56,130
so like every fight I'm looking
to make improvements and change.

614
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,580
Like I'm not going to ever sit here and
say I know everything and that it's just,

615
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,180
I have no excuses. Katelyn found a
way to beat me, you know what I mean?

616
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,940
Juliana found a way to beat me.
I kinda beat myself in that one too,

617
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:10,470
cause I let my head get into my,
you know, and that sucked in again,

618
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,000
another thing for me to have put time
in and I'm happy I did, but I mean,

619
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:18,630
that got me to move to San Diego. So I
mean, I'm, I'm happy for that message.

620
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:23,550
It costs me a lot of money
to get that message, but I'll
take it. Um, and Caitlin,

621
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,070
yeah. She found a way to beat me in, into,

622
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,070
have been beaten by Jujitsu when I feel
very accomplished in Jujitsu that like

623
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:30,480
stung differently.
You know,

624
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:34,010
it's done way differently than just
someone else getting their hand raise.

625
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,960
Do you feel when you're in training
that you're the same as you were before,

626
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:38,794
when you were at your best?

627
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,360
Um, when I was at my best, no, but it's
something I'm working on. Like I have,

628
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,550
I know I have like the
hangups that I have. I know
there's a ton of mental stuff,

629
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:54,320
you know, one, um, just how life
happened and, and constantly having,

630
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,860
like I had this expedited adaptation
to training. I had to get new coaches,

631
00:37:57,861 --> 00:37:59,270
I had to find new gyms,

632
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:03,370
I had to do all of this while
in grief and being under like,

633
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,310
like this isn't the most forgiving
crowd, you know, like when,

634
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,120
when you're having a shit day,
definitely not the worst. It's crazy.

635
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,500
It's crazy because it's such a,

636
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:18,050
like you're so exposed and you're so
vulnerable as a fighter and the fans might

637
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:19,534
be the meanest.

638
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Well and yes,
there is so mean and,

639
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,530
but I feel like I have the best fans too.
Like I have the ones,

640
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,330
the ones that really old, there's no
ride or die and like I'm so proud of him,

641
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:35,130
but um, like I didn't even start
doing my own social media. My,

642
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,120
my husband did my social media and so
all of a sudden I get thrown in to social

643
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:44,590
media and how social media works when I'm
at my most like low vulnerable and all

644
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:46,460
that shit.
I didn't know you're not supposed to,

645
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,440
I'm looking at it like investments, right?
Like I'm like, Oh, here's the stock.

646
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,590
I'm going to put money into this stock
and let's just see how it turned out.

647
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,780
I was like,
ah.

648
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,570
And I think the first person that ever
told me not to do that was callin like

649
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,310
later, he's like, never read the
cop. What are you doing Brian?

650
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:05,920
Cal doesn't reach because I don't
read the comments, but I'm like,

651
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:08,890
well how will I know how I did?
He's like, just fucking no in here.

652
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,730
Peers, you're, no, you'll know from your
coaches and you'll know, you'll know.

653
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,070
Well it's,
I mean it's sex when you know,

654
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:19,730
like six hours later you wrote some shit
that people are taking wrong or I mean

655
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,470
it's like an opportunist situation.

656
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:24,860
They like wait for you to
fuck up and they're like,
oh, right there, right there.

657
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:27,220
I'm like, you know, I didn't mean
to say that or you know what?

658
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:29,720
That's not how I meant it or whatever.
But hard

659
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,610
because everybody's text looks the same.
Yeah.

660
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:37,710
The tax that you would get from a Holly
Holm or someone you respect versus a

661
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:41,250
text he get from some fat slob
sitting there eating Cheetos,

662
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:43,950
farting into their hands.
The same person.

663
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,650
Like it looks the same as on text,

664
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:52,250
but it's just you're going to get like
some people that just want to hurt your

665
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:55,440
feelings because they suck
and their life is terrible.

666
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,950
Like I've never met a hater that's
doing great. Like there's no, no.

667
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:01,740
Haters are like, man, my fucking life is
awesome. But you know what I liked doing?

668
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,150
I go on Youtube and I just go make
comments that are just trying to hurt

669
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:08,790
someone's feelings.
I just try to cut them to the bone.

670
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Just say fucked up shit about dead
relatives, what they did wrong.

671
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,670
Those people were all just losers,
just fucking losers, you know? I mean,

672
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:20,160
there's just no way around it.
That's all they are.

673
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,750
It was so foreign to me because I mean
in wrestling, like I did wrestling,

674
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:25,790
I did soccer, volleyball, swimming.

675
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:30,791
Like I never ever heard
anyone be discouraging like
no one ever came to me and

676
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:34,560
was like, fuck you. You
suck. Yeah, you wouldn't

677
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,590
get that from someone
who was a fan or someone.

678
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,720
Even if someone's from an opposing
team and like she ain't shit this.

679
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,740
They're just saying that because they
want to beat you. You know? It's like,

680
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,810
but the, the haters that you're
dealing with online, they
just, there's a lot. Look,

681
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,150
life is fucking complicated.

682
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,180
It's hard to get right and as you're
seeing with your very difficult career,

683
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,890
there's, there's a lot of like
decisions to be made. There's you,

684
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,170
you can fuck it up. You got to
build back up again. Try. Right?

685
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:08,820
And you're a smart person who's
strong and successful for losers.

686
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,030
Life is impossible.
It's impossible.

687
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:17,090
And so they go through life just angry
and depressed and sad and failing at

688
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:18,690
everything they do.

689
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:22,620
But they still have a phone or they still
have a laptop and like you fucking con

690
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,560
flooding loser. And that's what you're
getting. That's what you're getting.

691
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,470
You're getting the all that anger
and you didn't even know this person.

692
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,333
Why are they angry at you?

693
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,610
Because they're angry at life because
life is fucked him in the ass.

694
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,710
That's they're angry.

695
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,870
They're angry at life because they
got dealt a shit existence. Right?

696
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:43,310
They have bad genetics, they have
a bad family, they have a bad job,

697
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:47,870
they live in a bad neighborhood, they have
bad people around them. They feel bad,

698
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,320
everything's wrong. And,
but they still get to talk.

699
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,720
They still get to talk shit and
they still get to type things,

700
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,250
type mean things out.
That's,

701
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,180
that's why he can't read
comments cause it's fucking,

702
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,750
the only thing you could do is inspire
with your work with you what you do.

703
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:05,480
And you do that already, you
know, and you're a human being.

704
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,790
You're gonna make mistakes and you're
going to do things right and going to do

705
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,624
things wrong,

706
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,760
and you're going to have these epic
moments and you're going to have these

707
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,610
failures because that's just a part of
like doing things that are complicated,

708
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,720
but you can't read the comments.
You definitely can't take them to heart.

709
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,910
Noted. Yes, no. Did he got me
good a couple of times I get, Oh,

710
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:27,510
fuck up your day. Yeah, day.
Yeah. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

711
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,990
Ken, what then happened? It's sad
because those people that are doing that,

712
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:33,250
they're in pain.
This is the know,

713
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,040
the only reason why they would lash
out at you like that and they go, no,

714
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,290
I'm just telling the truth.
Who just can't handle the truth.

715
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,690
Even if it was the truth.

716
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:45,520
The way in which people say it in the
reason why they're saying is because they

717
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,970
want to hurt your feelings.
They're not being kind. You know,

718
00:42:48,971 --> 00:42:53,170
there's a lot of that going on today.
I mean even then, even in the media,

719
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:57,220
the way people tell stories and write
stories and write articles about people,

720
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:00,550
it's like they're not,
this is not just that.

721
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:03,190
They're trying to tell the facts
and explain what's happening.

722
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,390
They're trying to cut people down
and hurt people and it's, this is,

723
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,050
I wonder how much of it has to do with
the fact that our fucking president does

724
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:14,440
that because it seems more
prevalent now than ever before.

725
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:19,470
It seems like there's like a trend and
I think a lot of like one of the things

726
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:22,060
about the president,
whoever the president is,

727
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,670
it's like there's some people that are
not going to listen to anything he says,

728
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:29,200
but there's a certain amount of people
that are gonna take his actions and use

729
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:31,280
it as almost like a barometer.
Yeah.

730
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,470
Example of how they should behave
and how this country behaves.

731
00:43:35,471 --> 00:43:40,471
It's like he's the top dog and when the
top dog is insulting people all the time

732
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:44,120
and saying shitty things and holds
it can be successful. Yeah. It's,

733
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,770
it lets people know there's, or you
want to get ahead. I want to get ahead.

734
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:51,490
You got to do like him and then they, they
go out and act like assholes too. Yeah,

735
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:56,080
that's a bummer. So anyway, you
go down to San Diego and what,

736
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,730
what are they doing for you that gets
you off of the antidepressants and gets

737
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:01,564
you feeling better?

738
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:06,400
Whoa. Uh, it's again, like you get in
there and I mean it's, it's scary to go.

739
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,490
Again, like I said, there's, there's
all these different people in there.

740
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,050
The man found the, the
research on it by, um,

741
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,120
treating his own autistic kid and,

742
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:19,510
and you can see the before
and after videos of this kid
and it's like, damn. Okay.

743
00:44:19,511 --> 00:44:21,430
And then, um, I brought my son into,

744
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:25,150
cause he has ADHD and he's off
his medication now as well.

745
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,610
So I'm going in there.
Uh,

746
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,700
they do a EEG first and then they can
tell which of your brain are firing it,

747
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,980
what hurts in seeing,
um,

748
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,490
the congruency is in like how all of
that is happening or not happening.

749
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,590
And then they kind of prescribed these,
these different,

750
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,130
these machines like on your,
on your brain that make, uh,

751
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,570
these like electric impulses,
but they're magnetic to, um,

752
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,060
kind of speed up or slow down the
different parts of your brain.

753
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,030
So if the front of your brain is moving
slower than the back of your brain are

754
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:01,950
those or, or whatever. So, um,
they're noticing obviously, uh,

755
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,280
patterns with fighters, hockey
players, football players, like,

756
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,810
like people that are leading with
their heads basically. Um, having like,

757
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,610
uh, and then with the veterans that are
like emotional things to where I mean,

758
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,020
and yeah, and then like, I mean,
having to compartmentalize as well,

759
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:23,550
like some of the shit they see should be
upsetting, you know, and, and, you know,

760
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:26,040
but there's, there's different ways
that we can train our brain to,

761
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,720
to drop things like that.

762
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:32,430
And then PTSD is when it's an involuntary
and it all comes in and, and that,

763
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:37,080
so, you know, I, I've
been diagnosed with PTSD.

764
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,990
I had walked in there with medication
because of being depressed, uh,

765
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,900
and the anxiety and all of that.
Like my symptoms were terrible.

766
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:49,830
And I know they're a combination
of things, but even like
my startle reflex, like,

767
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,310
you know, I could hear
someone come walking around
the corner like clack, clack,

768
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:55,950
clack here, their shoes. But the
second I'd see them, it would,

769
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:00,360
it would stop my heart for a second. And
that's like shit on your adrenal glands,

770
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:04,130
you know, and, and, um, all
this stuff was, you know,

771
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:07,950
an anxiety that, um, I don't know. It was,

772
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:10,740
it was hard to fall asleep
at night. Uh, you know,

773
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:13,630
my memory was crap and this is all,
you know,

774
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,220
different stuff happening in all these
other fighters that I know as well.

775
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,480
But I mean, like I said, I've
been trying things so much,

776
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,860
so much over the past few years that I
get excited about and either it works or

777
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:30,470
it doesn't. And, um,
the, the point is, is,

778
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,990
is now I found this and I
feel better from this, but I,

779
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,120
I was so excited about all
these other things. Like,

780
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:39,360
I can't just start telling everybody of
the new thing that I've found because

781
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:43,020
I've said that and been excited about
like everything else with this one,

782
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:47,880
this one, like the equal
scope, it's like, uh, it's uh,

783
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,070
um, same thing. It's kind of like a tens
machine or stem machine, but like a super,

784
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:57,930
super low frequency and that's bad
ass to like it, it helped on injuries.

785
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,360
Like if I rolled my ankle or hurt my toe,

786
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:03,120
like you could bring the
swelling down from this to,

787
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,680
to normal essentially in like an hour
and a half just working on with this like

788
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,450
tens unit on it. And, and I mean,

789
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,890
they originally used it for
race horses and for, you know,

790
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,430
super expensive million dollar horses.
Like the equipment they brought over,

791
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:22,431
it was like 90 grand and like s like
these really specific like special metals

792
00:47:23,701 --> 00:47:26,910
that were put into these plates and you
know, they would do stuff like that,

793
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,500
but that wasn't working on my head.

794
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,270
It was working injuries
and it was working on, um,

795
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:36,430
I want to say it helped with like my,
like digestive system maybe or my, um,

796
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,860
uh, I don't remember some, some
other things it was helping with too,

797
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,330
but what, you know, I,

798
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,070
I started doing that or I was doing that
when I walked into mindset and started

799
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:52,660
doing that treatment. And so what do they
do it? So you sit in a chair, you know,

800
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,600
and they ha they put this prescription
in this machine and the machine has kinda

801
00:47:56,601 --> 00:47:57,434
got like a,

802
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,440
like a arm that goes on in a specific
part of your brain and you, you know,

803
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:07,420
you close your eyes and it sends these,
these magnetic pulses into your head.

804
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,430
And I mean,
you don't feel anything.

805
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:13,150
It's almost like you can
hear what it feels like,

806
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,820
but I don't know how to describe it.
It's, it's a sense, it's essential,

807
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:21,950
but it's not, it's not exactly hearing
and it's not exactly feeling, um,

808
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:28,060
yeah. And I mean you, you leave the
place after your treatment. Like I go,

809
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:31,660
I would go twice a day.
It's 45 minutes away both ways.

810
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,850
So I am driving a lot everyday to go to
do this cause I want to give it a fair

811
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:39,910
shot. You do it every day? I do everyday.

812
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:44,340
I haven't gone these past couple of
weeks cause uh, stuff with my kids. Uh,

813
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,100
schedule school's almost out and then
wanting to try out different things with

814
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:51,130
different coaches as far as
these new disciplines go.

815
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,800
So I haven't been there as much.
But um,

816
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:58,890
yeah for the last August I believe
is is when I was like really,

817
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:03,370
really getting into it and go on
twice a day and 45 minutes each way.

818
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,360
Twice a day. Twice a
day, yeah. So you would,

819
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:11,460
you would spend 45 minutes one way and
then go back again and then go back,

820
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,230
watch his fucking move
closer to where the places,

821
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:18,220
because the alliance was
down there and so I would,

822
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,110
I would drop my kid off at school.

823
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,370
I would run and then I would go there.
I would do my treatment,

824
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,160
I go back to practice down
in southern San Diego,

825
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,300
then I'd get my son and then we'd go
up there for the afternoon session.

826
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,310
And then I'd come back down and,

827
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:35,800
and we'd go to his sports and
then I'd have my second two a day

828
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,430
that does not leave a lot of free time
for cats and Ghana. Oh Hell No. Oh No, no.

829
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,750
Just that alone can be stressful.
But I was seeing the results.

830
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,910
That was the crazy thing
is I was feeling better.

831
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,910
The results when I just
walked in, like, like God,

832
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:59,080
like I couldn't sleep. I had just,
uh, anxiety, like I had that,

833
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,880
that startle effect going like
the, um, my memory was shit.

834
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,680
And these were all things that I went
to the UFC pie to talk to them about.

835
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:11,530
Cause I'm like, I don't know what
to do. Like I, I want to fight.

836
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:15,910
They offered me to fight Chris
Cyborg at one 45. And I was like,

837
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,870
yeah. And I was like, well, like
hell yeah, let's take that. But like,

838
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:22,720
can you guys at least help me get this
shit figured out first, please? You know?

839
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:26,560
And they're like, sure. Um,
so Dunkin French, he's at the,

840
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,030
the, he's, he's, he's, so he went to
college and t and was that an oh no,

841
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:35,630
he was at Notre Dame using
this treatment with the doctor.

842
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,100
I'm Kevin Murphy that
runs the mindset. So, uh,

843
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,413
he was like,

844
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,840
this guy is doing a lot of things with
people as far as brain health. He's like,

845
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,050
go see them when you get back to San
Diego, it's kind of far from you.

846
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:51,770
But like give it a shot cat. And I
called the guy, I'm on the phone,

847
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,950
super frustrated, like super
emotional. I'm like, I'm,

848
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:56,930
I'm at my wit's end.

849
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:00,080
Like I've tried everything I can
think of like holistic views,

850
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:03,200
like chemical views, this
like everything. I mean,

851
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:06,230
spending money out of my pocket trying
to figure this out because none of this

852
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,810
is covered by the UFC.
Especially because you know,

853
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:10,670
not something I claimed in a fight.
I mean,

854
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:13,880
I fought Amanda and if you don't
claim that stuff within the 30 days,

855
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:17,060
like you're on your own. And of course
my head hurt. Of course I'm dizzy.

856
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:19,820
Of course the lights are bright.
Of course. I can't think. Right.

857
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:24,080
I got in a fist fight, you know, and I, I
wasn't doing good in it for awhile, so I,

858
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,480
I figured, you know, but
then a month and a half,

859
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:30,400
two months out when I wasn't
better. It's like, sure.

860
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,630
Even though it clearly came from that
fight, you still don't get covered.

861
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,840
[inaudible] what? Not One. It's
endocrine stuff too, you know?

862
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:42,260
And it's like there's very,
there's like how could they

863
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,600
dispute that? That's where it came
from though. You go, hey, sit down.

864
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,200
I want you to watch something and
just play that first round. Go.

865
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:51,750
What the fuck do you think happened?
I don't know,

866
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,700
but I mean if you play
that video for them,

867
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:57,930
if any buddy in the insurance
business was denying you coverage,

868
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:02,160
saying that didn't happen. D while
you were under the banner of the UFC,

869
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,560
like you're out of your fucking mind.
Watch that video.

870
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,210
What do you think is happening while this
fucking assassin is throwing bombs at

871
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:13,920
your face? I mean that's it. That
is crazy. That that's not covered.

872
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,190
Yeah, that makes me sick. Oh,

873
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:20,810
it's frustrating cause bye by like
literally you look at the papers like it

874
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:25,410
costs me more to fight then,
then it, then I make Lucy now

875
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,301
makes sense.

876
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:29,960
If it was dealing with a broken hand or
a torn ligament or something like that,

877
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,860
it might make sense in Mike.
It does not make any fucking sense.

878
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,520
If you're talking about brain injuries
cause anybody who understands how brain

879
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,350
injuries work know that there's,

880
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:43,040
there's a considerable amount of time
after a fight where you still are

881
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:47,360
suffering from symptoms and you might
decide 30 days later, 60 days later,

882
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:49,070
90 days later you've got
to do something about it.

883
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,760
All right, well I mean now I know now
I come out of a fight and I'm like,

884
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:56,060
my pinky hurts, my elbow hurts,
my hair hurts, my eyebrow hurt.

885
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:58,970
It's like when a claim all of this,
you know,

886
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:02,700
because before I was just being tough,
you know? Yeah, I'm fine with fuckers do.

887
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:05,990
This is why it's so crazy and I didn't
like, I didn't get it and I didn't know.

888
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,020
And then,

889
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,400
but they should know if they're in the,

890
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,680
they're in the business
of insuring fighters,

891
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,360
they should have a larger window where
people can claim head injuries. Right.

892
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:20,220
Well that's, I mean that it kind of
goes together with like any kind of,

893
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,540
any kind of mental, anything. Like
any, you talk about mental illness,

894
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,720
you talk about head injuries,
you talking about Tbi,

895
00:53:26,721 --> 00:53:30,270
it all goes into that stigma of like,
you can't see it, so it must not be real,

896
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,270
you know what I mean? Or,
or whatever. So it's like,

897
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,830
but that's the head injury
business. I mean, basically, yeah.

898
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,020
The point is to make
them drop and be done.

899
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,900
That's what everybody, I mean, it's not,
it's not the worst thing in the world.

900
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:44,460
The wind with a body kick or an arm bar.

901
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:48,000
But the reality is what people like is
to see head injuries were in the head

902
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:51,270
injury business. Right.
You know? Yeah. Yeah.

903
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:56,750
So how long after you starting with this
treatment do you start to see results?

904
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,960
So the first,

905
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:04,900
I would say the first thing I noticed
was my motor skills in practice.

906
00:54:04,901 --> 00:54:06,500
And so, you know, I would go,

907
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,690
so you think your motor
skills were impaired?

908
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,300
No, I, well I just feel like I had
a block. Like I said, like it's,

909
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:17,120
it was comical and I mean you can even
ask them at alliance. And it was funny.

910
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:22,580
It was funny, but not to have
like we're in class, you know,

911
00:54:22,581 --> 00:54:24,290
we're learning,
I'm watching the coaches,

912
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:28,820
like they do a drill and they explain
it and they look up. All right,

913
00:54:28,821 --> 00:54:31,120
everybody ready? Ready?
One, two, three go.

914
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,580
And we clap and I have no fucking
idea what we're doing. You know,

915
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,910
like we walk off and I'm like,

916
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,400
like there was even a couple
of times where they're like,

917
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,880
they clap and they're like, Kat,
what are we doing? And I'm like, um,

918
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:49,190
three kick. And they're
like, no, 20 pushups. And I'm
like, man, I'm not even like,

919
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,530
I'm not just a bad kid
like talking and like, no,

920
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,070
let's say like I'm in trouble
because I don't hear you.

921
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:58,610
I can like not lose eye
contact the whole time,

922
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:01,970
like sit here and I'm like focused,
but no,

923
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:05,900
I'm not retaining it and less like if it
has to be the last thing that they do.

924
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,370
Like we can't talk about shit if,
if,

925
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,860
if it's the last thing I see I
can go do it, I could go do it.

926
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,910
But if they're like all right and then
they explained some philosophy about it

927
00:55:16,911 --> 00:55:20,990
or do some movement or whatever, like
then I lose what we're doing. Like my,

928
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:22,910
my mind would just go
right to something else.

929
00:55:22,911 --> 00:55:27,520
Like I had a very hard time
concentrating and you know, it's,

930
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:30,920
it's crazy because when I got to this
facility, you know, I didn't know,

931
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,680
I didn't necessarily know what I
was walking into. But they have,

932
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:37,730
you do this questionnaire and like on
this questionnaire is like all of these

933
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:38,271
things.
I'm like,

934
00:55:38,271 --> 00:55:41,240
that's part of something like me not being
able to focus as part of something my

935
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:42,200
sleep,
that's part of something,

936
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:46,250
this startle effect is part of something
like me having these like completely

937
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:50,510
like specific things that are
all on. This was like, damn okay.

938
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:54,410
Like I didn't even want to see the EEG
because I was, I was scared. You know,

939
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:55,070
I was like,

940
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:58,130
what if you can't fix me and now I know
all the shit that's wrong with me like

941
00:55:58,131 --> 00:56:00,530
that, that sucks. But then you know,

942
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:02,900
they show you different
egs and they show you the,

943
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,890
they take it every single week and so
you actually get to see it and you get to

944
00:56:06,891 --> 00:56:09,050
see the level that you
were functioning at,

945
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,120
especially the different
parts of your brain. But then,

946
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:14,390
and the thing is that's awesome about
this is you get to keep the results.

947
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,830
Like unless you go do exactly what
you did and go fuck it up again,

948
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:22,130
like you get to keep it.
It's not like this maintenance package,

949
00:56:22,131 --> 00:56:26,410
which is you know, a problem
for these pharmaceutical
companies. There's, there's,

950
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,940
there's not a whole lot of retention on
it because once people get their brains

951
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:31,361
functioning,

952
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:33,730
as long as you're not sitting there
hitting your head against a wall,

953
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:38,230
like you get to keep feeling better. Like
these, these veterans get to go back to,

954
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,270
to combat or whatever it is, their job
is like we fighters get to go back,

955
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,140
football players get to go back. Like
I, I sat in with the chargers, uh,

956
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:50,560
medical staff and talked about
our stuff there as well. I, I,

957
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:55,570
I don't even remember who else there was
people from all over the country coming

958
00:56:55,571 --> 00:56:59,800
in asking about this, you know,
and, and needing to sit in and, and,

959
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:04,360
and they're looking at these egs
in particular. So what is it doing?

960
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:09,550
Like go, how was it fixing it? So
wine, um, I think it, you know,

961
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,970
there's something with what
goes on in your brain with,

962
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,770
with the thyroid stuff,

963
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:18,640
with the endocrine stuff is like getting
your damage to your hypothalamus. Right?

964
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:19,474
And that's like,

965
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,820
that kind of directs all of the
information that goes to your thyroid,

966
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:27,130
your thyroid, you know, then
sends out everything to your body.

967
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:30,400
And there when there's like
a disconnect there. Um, no,

968
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:32,800
it just screws everything up.
And then on top of it,

969
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:36,580
like now that we're cutting the
same way we've always had to cut,

970
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,090
but we don't get ivs. I mean, I mean you,

971
00:57:39,091 --> 00:57:44,091
you cannot 100% rehydrate your
brain within 45 or 48 hours.

972
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:50,200
Like you can get your body
decently hydrated, I believe,
but your brain is just,

973
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,700
it's its own thing,
you know.

974
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,900
And so now we don't have ivs are hydraulic
system in our brain is down and now

975
00:57:55,901 --> 00:58:00,250
we're rattling it even more
like dehydrated. I mean,
we're just going to have,

976
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:05,050
you know, bigger side effects, uh,
tire brains being dehydrated that now,

977
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:10,150
um, the damage that comes to the
hypothalamus to the pituitary, to the,

978
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:14,770
um, your thyroid, all of that that
goes on there, that, that they're,

979
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:16,090
they're saying that you can,

980
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,930
you can get it firing back at a level
that it was before it got hurt. Like,

981
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:24,040
as long as the cells are still alive
in it, they can reenergize those cells.

982
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,130
Now if you have like just a dead
part of your brain, you know,

983
00:58:27,131 --> 00:58:30,350
they're not bringing it back to life,
but they can um,

984
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:35,080
use these magnets to kind of fluff on
backup, give them back their energy,

985
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:37,720
their, their life and, and put in a,

986
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,190
put them in back into a functional way
that was something similar to you at your

987
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:45,100
healthiest and,
and make it,

988
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,490
I mean not more or less durable just back,
right?

989
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,050
Yeah. When you, when you were saying
motor skills, like what was wrong?

990
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,740
Cause that's one of the things that
they see in fighters that have taken too

991
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:59,700
many shots. They start having
the, they analyze fighters,

992
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:04,350
gates and one of the things that happens
is your legs get closer together. Um,

993
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,770
your, your balance is off
your, your steps are shorter.

994
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:12,360
You don't have that sort of like dynamic
fluid motion to your body and you're

995
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:16,010
having a heart, a harder time
with balance and just motor skill.

996
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,160
Yeah, totally. So how I felt
before going into there,

997
00:59:19,161 --> 00:59:23,120
it was all I had was the gas pedal.
I was like, just will, you know,

998
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:26,570
and just fuck them.
You know, just cause I,

999
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,540
I wasn't reading patterns
of people anymore.

1000
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:32,930
Like if someone leans this way
a little bit, I'm like, okay,

1001
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:36,030
I know what you're thinking.
Like if they set this way or that way and,

1002
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:40,650
and even me juking them and like
trying to like faint at them. Like I,

1003
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,940
I wasn't, I couldn't even see the
reaction I was making them make,

1004
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:47,810
like I knew what motions in my
muscular memory to make them do,

1005
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:51,800
but like I wasn't getting the feedback
because it, it just like wasn't,

1006
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,560
so that was one of the first
things I noticed was, you know,

1007
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:56,150
going back into practice and,

1008
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,840
and watching people's angles
and beating them to it and, and,

1009
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:03,440
and like remembering, I'm like, damn, I
don't just have to shoot to shoot. Like,

1010
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:07,580
I can wait and do it when it's
the right time or I can even like,

1011
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:11,040
like take advantage of, of
the fact that, you know,

1012
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,170
I'm making them step back or I can flash
fire and they're facing and jump on

1013
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:17,570
them at their knee jerk reaction,
you know,

1014
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:21,590
like these things of like being able to
manipulate the situation and make them

1015
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:25,760
adjust to me. Like I could see
that again and I could see, um,

1016
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,310
would you him before,
like when I just had go,

1017
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,820
all I had was when you
didn't see movement,

1018
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:34,730
like say if someone was going to spin
and they're like we're loaded up their

1019
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:38,810
hips. You didn't see, no, it just hit, hit
him first. What were you seeing? I all,

1020
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,120
I didn't,
all I saw was get their first,

1021
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,050
all I saw was like close the distance,
don't get hit in the head.

1022
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:49,820
Like make like get down and get
low and just be a linebacker,

1023
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:53,660
you know, and, and hit him because
I knew I wasn't seeing that stuff.

1024
01:00:53,661 --> 01:00:57,320
And the more I tried to see it, the
more I would just sit there and wear it.

1025
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:59,870
Cause I'm like any minute now.
I mean any minute now I'm going to,

1026
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:02,060
I'm going to catch the pattern,
I'm going to catch the pattern.

1027
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,890
And it wasn't popping up.

1028
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,930
So then all I had was just super
light sparring. Just moving around.

1029
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:13,580
You didn't see it? No, no, not really. No.

1030
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,060
Yeah, that's fucking terrified. I
was like, yeah, it was really scary.

1031
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:21,170
And like even I'd even get to like a
good position in Jujitsu and I'd be like,

1032
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:23,420
I know I know stuff here.
I know I know stuff here.

1033
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,970
But she didn't know what to do. What was
it? What was it? What was it? I know,

1034
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:30,530
I know stuff, you know? But like it wasn't
like, especially with adrenaline firing,

1035
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:34,450
like it wasn't just happening for me.
And so like three,

1036
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,540
four weeks into that,

1037
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:39,590
all of a sudden like that fog was
starting to go down a bit. Right.

1038
01:01:39,591 --> 01:01:43,980
And like part of it was, and then, and
then I'm also sleeping better, you know,

1039
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,710
to go before like during
like the first week. Oh yeah.

1040
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:51,260
Cause every fucking person I went to
could fix me and driving 45 minutes.

1041
01:01:51,261 --> 01:01:55,940
Like what the fuck?
Yeah, yeah. In a, in a,

1042
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:00,590
in a car I leased. So all
those miles, you know,

1043
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:05,450
it's like damn. And um, it's
uh, it's super frustrating.

1044
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:08,690
Yes. Everyone can fix me, everyone
can fix me. And then they don't.

1045
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:11,330
And then my heart's broken again and
then I go to the next one and then my

1046
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:13,790
heart's broken again and then, and then
the next one. So this one I'm like,

1047
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:14,631
I'm like,

1048
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:18,830
I'm not even going to tell people about
this because I'm sick of fucking hitting

1049
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:21,840
up and being excited about it and
telling them to come with me and then it

1050
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:24,360
doesn't work. And then I'm
that guy again, you know?

1051
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:27,900
And so going into this and then watching
it work and then seeing all the other

1052
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,670
people that was working for in there that,

1053
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:33,570
and they were never trying to push me to
promote it. They were like, just come in,

1054
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,360
just get here. You know, and
if you like it then until the,

1055
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:41,580
cause the UFC was talking about getting
one of the machines at the Pi and

1056
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:45,000
they're kind of going to have
me be like a Guinea pig for it.

1057
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,640
Ian Mccall went in there too,
but it didn't like he,

1058
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:52,170
he was doing his own kind of other stuff
that was making it so it wasn't working

1059
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:55,260
for him, but like I was all in, you know,

1060
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,030
that was making it so it wasn't,

1061
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,000
I don't think he was coming in often.
So I think,

1062
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:04,320
and the thing is is that it does stir
shit up, right? So like they, they,

1063
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,430
they mess with your,
the the levels because again,

1064
01:03:07,431 --> 01:03:11,540
they have to like if the back of your
brain is running at four hertz and, and,

1065
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:15,320
okay, eight is technically where like
you're sleeping, you're at rest like year,

1066
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,800
there's part of your brains that could
be under your resting hurts, right.

1067
01:03:18,801 --> 01:03:23,801
While the front of your brain is running
at 12 so that's like high anxiety but

1068
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:26,360
like low energy and, and, and they can,

1069
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:29,060
they can almost tell you how
you've been feeling lately,

1070
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:33,530
which was like nuts to me. Right.
And they can tell, you know,

1071
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:34,660
because of this and this that,

1072
01:03:34,661 --> 01:03:39,470
that you have some OCD tendencies versus
this person constantly feels like they

1073
01:03:39,471 --> 01:03:40,310
have no energy in,

1074
01:03:40,311 --> 01:03:44,780
their memory isn't working and they're
emotionally and capable of like being in,

1075
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,560
you know,

1076
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,810
being a positive force in a relationship
right now cause I don't have it so they

1077
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:53,390
could reach you should,
you should, you should.

1078
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:57,070
It's scary though cause I cute when you
see that like little like and they're

1079
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:57,810
like what's that?

1080
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,520
But it's for me it's, that's
a two hour drive. Shit.

1081
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,580
Yeah, I know that there, I don't
know if they have anything up here.

1082
01:04:03,581 --> 01:04:06,010
I know that they've,
they have a bunch all over.

1083
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,910
That is what it's called.
I couldn't,

1084
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:11,390
the website's not coming up but this
personalized repetitive transcranial

1085
01:04:11,391 --> 01:04:12,770
magnetic stimulation,

1086
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:16,890
a noninvasive therapeutic approach to
the treatment of Ptsd and other neuro

1087
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,320
neurocognitive disorders. Kevin,
Tim Murphy, MD, Vice Chair,

1088
01:04:21,321 --> 01:04:26,300
department of Radiation Medicine,
applied sciences, Uc San Diego Director,

1089
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:30,920
Pediatric Radiation Oncology Program.
Uh, Rady children's hospital,

1090
01:04:30,921 --> 01:04:35,480
San Diego. Wow. Yeah. So that's
where you're going. And um,

1091
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,190
I mean obviously during this whole thing
you have to be questioning what you do

1092
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,020
for a living.

1093
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,750
Oh yeah. Well, and it's like,
okay, so they can fix this.

1094
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:47,320
Say they fix it and then I go do it again.

1095
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:51,640
Cyborg. Right. I mean you were, you
were thinking about fixing it and you,

1096
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,680
you were going from one girl who hits
like a dude to another girl who might hit

1097
01:04:57,021 --> 01:05:00,220
like a bigger dude. Yeah. I
mean cyborgs fucking terrified.

1098
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:05,080
And it's like, I know healthy at
my healthiest, like no, no problem.

1099
01:05:05,081 --> 01:05:09,310
I believe that I believe in myself
like that. Like I can figure them out,

1100
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:12,160
especially in find a way
to not get hit doing it.

1101
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:16,400
Like I didn't get hit in my MMA career,
significant a hit,

1102
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:19,390
not one significant hit and tell Amanda.

1103
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,190
And then after that I was getting fucking
lit up. Right. And, and not even that.

1104
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:26,350
Even Juliana,
like she kind of opened him,

1105
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:31,210
bitch slap me a little bit from the
sides but I and but like I can find a way

1106
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:34,390
to, to like still control
it enough to be like,

1107
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:38,920
like very effective without taking
too much damage. But like that,

1108
01:05:38,921 --> 01:05:43,660
that slow of my, my motor
skills, my mechanics, it was,

1109
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:46,930
it was really bothering me. And that's
not how you go fight someone like Cyborg.

1110
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:50,140
You don't go in there with that
weight in your pocket. You know,

1111
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,640
it's so important that you're
talking about this because this is a,

1112
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,850
this is such a factor that
we don't see on the outside.

1113
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,990
Other people,
you know,

1114
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:01,480
other people than the people that are
really close to the talk to about these

1115
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:04,150
things. Like if we were
seeing you fight and you know,

1116
01:06:04,151 --> 01:06:08,620
when we see the decline of
certain fighters, you know,
you see certain fighters,

1117
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:12,040
they, they're in a couple really hard
fights and then you see it decline,

1118
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:15,820
like a real obvious decline in their
skills and their abilities. Very,

1119
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:20,800
very rarely are they opening up about
what's going on, about losing memory.

1120
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:24,040
About not being able to see
patterns and people about not,

1121
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:28,750
not having their motor skills in tune
anymore that things are off. You know,

1122
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,640
so you talking about this I think is,

1123
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:34,870
it's so important and it's so important
for young fighters to recognize like,

1124
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:39,280
Hey, this is also on the table.
Here's a great therapy for it.

1125
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,980
But this is also a possibility of,
you know,

1126
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:45,340
if you do fight a fucking
killer like Amanda Nunez,

1127
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,200
this is one of the things
that can happen to you.

1128
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:51,640
Oh, and it's partially because I
have, man, I have teammates. Yeah.

1129
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:55,140
I have people that are 10 times
worse than me that are just like,

1130
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,250
I mean the stuff I hear,
the stuff I see, it's,

1131
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,570
it's sad and it's scary and they have
kids and they're not going anywhere soon.

1132
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,800
You know what I mean? And they're passing
their Mris, you know what I mean? Like

1133
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:12,900
their MRRs cause what does it MRI
really see? I don't know. I don't know.

1134
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:18,020
But if they went to this place and got
all their brain mapped out and find out

1135
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:21,810
how everything is firing,
it might be a completely different result.

1136
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,240
Like we might be retiring
people way earlier,

1137
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:28,180
at least forcing them into therapy
way earlier as possible. Yeah,

1138
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:29,551
I mean in that,

1139
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:32,980
and that's the thing is it's like the
risk needs to be worth the reward and,

1140
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:36,430
and you know,
like right now in this sport it's,

1141
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:39,990
it's a juvenile and it's not
getting us like this kind of like,

1142
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,330
like I,

1143
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:47,250
I can't afford to take another two years
off because I went and I fought cyborg

1144
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:50,130
while I'm sick and something bad
happens to me. You know what I mean?

1145
01:07:50,131 --> 01:07:53,400
Like I want to be sharp and if,
and if that means I have to take time,

1146
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:58,610
take the time I took off off and get
healthy and do all of these different

1147
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,490
therapies, the conservative, traditional
and nontraditional, like all of that.

1148
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:07,170
And so I can feel the way I feel now.
Like I'm pumped and I'm excited.

1149
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:12,350
But like that is something that I really
want to know that people know they can

1150
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:17,120
go do. And it's not vulnerable.
It's not saying you're weak,

1151
01:08:17,121 --> 01:08:18,860
it's not something wrong with you.
Like,

1152
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:23,810
like it's your health and your longevity
and your future because that shit,

1153
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:26,300
if you don't treat it,
it doesn't get better.

1154
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,870
And like you don't understand the
depression, you don't understand like,

1155
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,020
and there's an identity that goes
away with, they see me and like,

1156
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:35,870
you failed or you can't do it
anymore, or whatever. Like that,

1157
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:40,730
that mental health aspect that comes
with the physical health of your brain,

1158
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:45,680
like that, all that all needs to, that
all needs to be more educated as far as,

1159
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:47,690
as these fighters go. As
far as all of it goes. Like,

1160
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:51,590
I'm happy to be the Guinea pig because
I'm damn, I just want to see everybody.

1161
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:52,424
Okay.
You know?

1162
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:56,130
Well, I'm, I'm happy that you're
talking about it, but it's, um,

1163
01:08:56,610 --> 01:09:01,590
it's been something that,
you know, I've talked about
quite a bit and, um, the, the,

1164
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:05,430
the real problems behind traumatic brain
injuries because I've had a bunch of

1165
01:09:05,431 --> 01:09:08,430
experts and I've talked to a bunch
of neurologists and I've talked to

1166
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:13,140
neuroscientists and people that are
really studying this stuff. And, um,

1167
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:16,140
I've been real vocal about it and it's,

1168
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,530
it's a tricky situation because
obviously I'm a commentator,

1169
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,260
but like when someone gets knocked out,

1170
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,870
I'm very vocal about them
taking a long time off.

1171
01:09:24,871 --> 01:09:28,800
And it was one of the things that happened
after Rhonda got knocked out by Holly.

1172
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,770
Um, they were talking about
getting her back within like,

1173
01:09:31,771 --> 01:09:35,790
it was like four or five months later
to to fight again and I was like,

1174
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,650
[inaudible], we're going to have a
rematch with Holly. And I'm like,

1175
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:41,400
you guys are fucking crazy.
Like you're crazy.

1176
01:09:41,401 --> 01:09:44,280
She shouldn't be doing anything.
She shouldn't be getting hit.

1177
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,770
She shouldn't it be
sparring. She, there's,

1178
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,500
she shouldn't be getting her head
rattled and she definitely shouldn't be

1179
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:54,240
fighting Holly fucking home who just
kicked her into another dimension five

1180
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:56,490
months later or whatever it
was six months later. I'm like,

1181
01:09:56,491 --> 01:09:59,130
there's no way this is not,
should not be happening.

1182
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,020
Like you don't even know
what's going on yet.

1183
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,420
You don't even know what kind of damage.
I mean,

1184
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:06,600
think of what happened with you and
Amanda did you stayed conscious at least?

1185
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:11,360
I mean, Rhonda got fucking flat
lined and then got hammer fist.

1186
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:13,770
It didn't the head while she was lined,
it was uh,

1187
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,770
one of the most brutal
knockouts in women's MMA ever.

1188
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:22,310
And you know, and you saw when she
came back and fought Amanda and,

1189
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:25,830
and got hit like right
away, that hesitation. Oh,

1190
01:10:25,831 --> 01:10:28,170
she was just stiffened up and the fear.

1191
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,260
And then also Amanda,

1192
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:34,890
I felt even before the Holly Holm fight,
I felt like Amanda was the,

1193
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,160
the more dangerous fight for
her because of her hands.

1194
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,820
Because Rhonda is always in this
position where she's closing the gap.

1195
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:45,360
She's getting close to you because she
wants to clinch up with you and throw you

1196
01:10:45,361 --> 01:10:48,600
and take you to the ground and arm bar
you and what have you. But with Amanda,

1197
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:52,770
you're dealing with a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
black belt who knocks people fucking

1198
01:10:52,771 --> 01:10:56,040
dead with one punch. Like it's
a terrible match up. I felt,

1199
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:59,400
and obviously that true proved to be true,

1200
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:04,401
but what drove me crazy was how dismissive
all these people behind the scenes

1201
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:05,130
were.

1202
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:09,240
All these agents and Hollywood people
and all these people that just have no

1203
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:14,130
idea what business they're in, they really
don't even understand this business,

1204
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,740
the business. It's basically
the business, like we said,

1205
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,880
of head injuries and you're just like,

1206
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,800
you're trying to sell
this thing where you're,

1207
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:26,970
you're dealing with someone who had a
fucking significant head injury and now

1208
01:11:26,971 --> 01:11:28,050
you're pushing it back in.

1209
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:32,130
There was someone who's really good at
delivering head injuries and is this,

1210
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:35,220
is this really all been mapped out?
I mean,

1211
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:37,990
what kind of training have
has changed? I mean, what you,

1212
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:41,940
she's still with the same coach. Has she
done anything differently? Like what,

1213
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:45,570
what do you think? What, what result
is going to be different? You know,

1214
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:50,571
and the downplaying of the significance
of a fucking ruthless knock out like

1215
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:53,370
that I just don't think
can be understated.

1216
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,300
I think people should take a long time
off when they get knocked out like that.

1217
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:58,290
A long time.

1218
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,080
Yeah.
Well,

1219
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:04,730
and I mean in especially some
sort of like invasive treatment,

1220
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:07,380
like from out the gates
or something like that.

1221
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:10,020
I looked at they should be
studied and I mean, I mean,

1222
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,620
I know they put a flashlight in
your eyes and ask you if you okay,

1223
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:15,290
send you to the doctor, do
whatever. But I mean like, and,

1224
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:19,610
and I think honestly that's what the
UFC is like effort was in, in this,

1225
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:25,280
in an offering. This information of this
treatment to me was to see like, hey,

1226
01:12:25,281 --> 01:12:28,970
is this something that would,
would benefit fighters in,
in a situation like that?

1227
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,980
It's at the Pi. I, it's not at the Pii,

1228
01:12:30,981 --> 01:12:35,450
but what they were saying is it
would be at the Pi, um, still.

1229
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:39,590
But the trick with it is that it is
something you need to, you need to go to,

1230
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:44,420
I need you to go to twice a day and
have that like schedule of it in that

1231
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:46,180
routine of it. But, uh,

1232
01:12:46,181 --> 01:12:51,181
says fighters like flying to only Vegas
for it and paying our own room and board

1233
01:12:51,321 --> 01:12:55,700
our own flight, potentially having to
fly our coaches and to have to, you know,

1234
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,800
keep us working and doing whatever
while we're working. I mean, it's just,

1235
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:03,960
I don't know. I mean, I don't know.
It's just tricky business. You know,

1236
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,620
it's real tricky business.
And how old are you now? 35.

1237
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,350
Do you wonder how much longer
are you going to do this?

1238
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,690
I like, I feel like I got like a
good couple of years left. Like I'm,

1239
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,490
I'm still having fun,
you know,

1240
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:19,060
and like the chest of it is still fun and
like the training is still fun and I'm

1241
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:23,220
still learning and like
enjoying it. And, um, I dunno,

1242
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:26,770
like getting through everything that I'm
getting through and learning everything

1243
01:13:26,771 --> 01:13:27,910
that I'm learning is like,

1244
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:31,150
it's so inspiring to me because
I definitely don't feel done.

1245
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:35,380
Like I still have so much fight in my
heart and like I really love putting my

1246
01:13:35,381 --> 01:13:40,120
hands on people and in always
like advancing and improving in,

1247
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:43,850
in the day I stopped
improving, you know? Uh,

1248
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:47,380
then I can look at that. But right
now, like I don't care about plan B,

1249
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,660
I don't care about what's next
because that's not what's happening.

1250
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:53,440
So your passion for doing this
still there? Yeah. And the purpose,

1251
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:58,240
the passion is, is huge. I love the
passion, you know, that to me is huge.

1252
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:02,350
But the purpose, like the bigger
picture, the, the what I'm doing here,

1253
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:05,650
what I was born to do,
what I was born to get through.

1254
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:07,870
Like I have to get through this,

1255
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,370
like I want to get through this
and I'm getting through this. I'm,

1256
01:14:11,371 --> 01:14:14,170
I'm watching myself and that is like,

1257
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:19,110
it's bad ass to me. It's
exciting to me. It's, it's, um,

1258
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:23,170
it's what I'm doing here, you know, and I,

1259
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:27,460
um, I'm all in like in, in, I can make,

1260
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,630
I can just make things for myself that,
um,

1261
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:36,430
I get to show myself every single day
that like no one could have ever told me,

1262
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,870
you know, it's all stuff
that I know firsthand from
my experience, from my world,

1263
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:45,580
from me trying things from me, risking
things like all of that. And, and,

1264
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:50,080
um, to understand myself
in, in, to know myself.

1265
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:53,230
Like it's been the biggest
reward out of all of this.

1266
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:58,030
Know yourself through the struggles and
know yourself through the fights. Yeah.

1267
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:01,210
All of it. I mean, and even
how much you get to learn,

1268
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:05,110
just even going into a fight, right?
Like, realizing, so going into a fight,

1269
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:08,350
being on antidepressants like,
okay, I'll wake up, I'll wake up.

1270
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:11,620
I don't know what this will do.
I feel flat. I don't feel flat.

1271
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:14,700
I'll be okay with these people there.
I'll be, I won't be okay with this.

1272
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,650
These people here,
like,

1273
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:20,560
like all of that is very
clear about things that like,

1274
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,920
this has my attention,
whether I know it or not,

1275
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:26,410
that that's something
in my life that needs,

1276
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,470
needs to be looked at and needs to be
addressed. Okay. There's direction.

1277
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:34,120
Like all I ever want is understanding
and direction. Like, I just want to know,

1278
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:38,010
you know, and so, um, I get
to deal with that, that,

1279
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,400
that leads me to come to San Diego.
San Diego is,

1280
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:44,050
is a new chapter in my life that
I get to name, you know, uh,

1281
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:46,360
also for my kid and myself.

1282
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:51,250
[inaudible] I get a reveal so much to
myself through trying different things and

1283
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:56,080
to just kind of like letting life take
me down the path that I'm supposed to

1284
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:59,110
without me sitting here
freaking out about control,

1285
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:03,360
freaking out about things that I,
I can do nothing about. You know,

1286
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:08,370
I just want to walk away from all of this
like content and happy with how I did.

1287
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,260
Whether that means I never
have my hand raised again.

1288
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,220
I don't think that's the case.
Like beating these girls,

1289
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:22,270
having the belt that is not a pipe
dream. I already beat them, you know,

1290
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:26,200
it's not like I'm incapable of that
and I'm just wishing I got my fingers

1291
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:27,160
crossed. You know, it's,

1292
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:32,580
it's not that my whole journey of my life
in sports from being a kid was to meet

1293
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:36,580
my highest, best, to be
my highest good. And,

1294
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,570
and that is what's
driven me the whole time.

1295
01:16:40,571 --> 01:16:45,571
I look at these girls and I respect
them because they're here doing what I'm

1296
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:48,790
doing. We're all just out here
trying to be the best at it.

1297
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:51,610
We're all trying to participate,
we're all trying to, you know,

1298
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:55,090
find ourselves in it and learn what we
can learn and go implement it, you know?

1299
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:57,670
And, and so for that, I have respect
for every single one of them.

1300
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:01,180
Some of them I like less than others.
Some of them I like more than others,

1301
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:05,770
you know, but, um, really like
we're building this stage together,

1302
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:10,070
we're doing this together, you know,
and I'm, I'm extremely proud to be part

1303
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,600
of something like this and my position
in it and my purpose in it is to,

1304
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:19,610
you know, find my personal
good, my personal best.

1305
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,850
And you know,
this has been extremely long road for me.

1306
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,020
Nothing has been easy and I respect that.
Like I'm grateful for that.

1307
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:30,140
Like all the things I know
because of the hard times.

1308
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:34,100
Like I feel fortunate to know,
you know,

1309
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:38,030
and I would never have learned them any
other way. And I get to handle them.

1310
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,490
And not only do I get to handle them,
I get to like,

1311
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:45,770
like relate and understand people and
see things differently because I get it,

1312
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:52,490
you know, maybe not exactly word
for word pinpoint per pinpoint. Oh,

1313
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:56,390
I'm having a chat to say that I
was going to make me fall over.

1314
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,200
But you know,
it's,

1315
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:01,910
it's all there and it all matters to
me and how I get through this really,

1316
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:06,050
really matters to me because
I know it matters to other
people too, you know? And,

1317
01:18:06,051 --> 01:18:08,720
and how they do inspires me as well.

1318
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:13,520
Do you know what you're going to do
when you stop? I, I just don't, I mean,

1319
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:18,530
I feel like there's this thing is there's
this awesome resume and building, right?

1320
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,690
You know, like I'm a UFC fighter, I'm a
national champion in wrestling. Like, I'm,

1321
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,580
um, um, I don't know.

1322
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:30,581
Constantly advocating and working on
working on myself and try and help get

1323
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,300
other people working on themselves too.
Like,

1324
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,960
I don't know what all that's going
to look like. And the thing is,

1325
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,710
is I don't even want to,
I don't want to look,

1326
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,590
I don't want to care about all that
yet because that's not where I'm at.

1327
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,140
And like,
I want to be all in here.

1328
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:45,290
I don't want to think about
what's next or plan B or,

1329
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:49,370
or how all of like all of that because
my heart is here. Right. You know,

1330
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:54,340
it's like what are you going to do in
your next marriage? Right. You know? Yeah.

1331
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,280
You know what I mean? Like I,
I'm right now I'm, I'm, I'm here,

1332
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,600
I'm doing what I'm doing.

1333
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:04,160
I'm not looking towards what's
next because right now I'm here.

1334
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:08,150
Yeah. No, listen, that's what you want to
hear from someone who's fighting. I mean,

1335
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:11,840
fighting should be all in that study
is the only way to approach it.

1336
01:19:11,841 --> 01:19:15,320
If you're a fighter and you're also a
neurosurgeon to part time real estate

1337
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:17,210
salesman,
good fucking luck.

1338
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:21,890
You don't have 100% to give everything.
You got one 100%

1339
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:23,870
especially with something like fighting,

1340
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:26,480
it's just such a crazy way to make living.

1341
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:30,170
You really have to be 100% committed
to it. It has to be your life.

1342
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,280
Yeah. I appreciate the
opportunity. I like.

1343
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:40,230
I like, I like everything I'm
doing right now, you know,

1344
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:42,340
and I feel like all of that
will be part of what's next,

1345
01:19:42,341 --> 01:19:46,490
but I like that that'll manifest.
That will figure itself out. I don't,

1346
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:50,500
I mean not to knock the like hippy
way of oh, everything will be great.

1347
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:54,850
I'm sure like when it's time I'll look
at that. But right now this is what I'm,

1348
01:19:54,851 --> 01:19:55,120
I'm looking

1349
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:55,980
at also the,

1350
01:19:55,990 --> 01:20:00,480
the kind of drive and discipline and work
ethic that you showed to become a top

1351
01:20:00,481 --> 01:20:03,060
level MMA fighter and a
national champion in wrestling.

1352
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:06,570
You could do anything with that.
Whatever you set your mind to.

1353
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,070
I really believe that.
I mean,

1354
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:12,540
I think the biggest problem that fighters
have when they retire is finding a

1355
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,100
thing to put their energy too.

1356
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:19,101
And then their identity because their
identity is of a fighter and when that is

1357
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:24,270
taken away from them, there's that.
And also the thrill. I mean there's,

1358
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:29,280
you guys are experiencing a level
of excitement and intensity.

1359
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,190
Like when you're talking
about two weeks out,

1360
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:34,980
you're crying in the fetal position
and going, what the fuck am I doing?

1361
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:40,450
But that all builds up to these moments
like that crazy primal scream after you

1362
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:43,410
stopped Amanda Nunez.

1363
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:49,350
That's a experience at very few people
other than people fight to the death are

1364
01:20:49,351 --> 01:20:51,480
feeling there's,
there's something,

1365
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:56,550
there's something that you guys are
experiencing that unless you're the person

1366
01:20:56,551 --> 01:21:00,270
in the woods fighting over that bone,
you really don't know. You don't know.

1367
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:03,690
And then for you to go to
regular life after that,

1368
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:07,610
it's going to be hard and it's going
to be hard for a lot of fighters. It's,

1369
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:12,640
it's very difficult for a lot of fighters
to find another thing that excites

1370
01:21:12,691 --> 01:21:17,010
them. The way finding excites them
because it's such a crazy pursuit.

1371
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,760
And then on top of that you're
dealing with what you're dealing with,

1372
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:23,940
but you're dealing with it
publicly. You're talking
about it, which I think is a,

1373
01:21:23,941 --> 01:21:27,210
you're doing a great service to
everybody when you're talking about your

1374
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:31,050
problems and your issues because there's
so many fighters that you know that

1375
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:34,650
they were experiencing this and that I
know that are experiencing this and you

1376
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:35,610
know everybody who,

1377
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:40,940
anybody who's done any sort of martial
arts competition and been in gyms,

1378
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,580
you're going to see people that
have that have taken too many shots.

1379
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:47,880
It's just part of the
game. And you, you know,

1380
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:53,050
it's what you're doing by talking about
it so openly while you're still a top

1381
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:57,270
level fighter is I think very,
very important for everybody. Huh,

1382
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,990
thanks. I'm trying, man.

1383
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,930
It's been allowed to try and things, but
I do, I do feel value in this. You know,

1384
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,270
and I mean exactly when people are done,
like there's some pride in,

1385
01:22:11,271 --> 01:22:15,420
in having to go get a nine to five or
whatever, you know, after being a level,

1386
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,180
a fighter at this level,
mind you should,

1387
01:22:18,181 --> 01:22:21,690
you not have the fucking brain
cells to be in. Like, it's like,

1388
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,140
like I got high functioning thing that you
can be proud of. You know, I mean it's,

1389
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:30,360
it can be really stressful to not live
up to the capability that, you know,

1390
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:33,390
you have what you're just not like
there's that wall or that fog or whatever,

1391
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:34,710
you know.
So I mean,

1392
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:38,250
I just think people maintaining
themselves and doing everything they can,

1393
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,740
however vulnerable it feels
like, fuck it. Do it. Like it is

1394
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:44,800
well that they could spread
this therapy across the country.

1395
01:22:44,801 --> 01:22:45,610
And how big are these?
Yeah,

1396
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:50,350
they have, I mean they look like
they, so they, they have, um,

1397
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,160
like mobile units, but again,
like it would need to be on,

1398
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:57,550
I don't know if it's on some sort of route
or whatever that people would need to

1399
01:22:57,551 --> 01:23:01,690
be able to show up to or
what. But um, they uh,

1400
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,150
yeah,

1401
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,830
I know they have one in Indiana.
I know,

1402
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,680
I know they're going to have one in
Colorado soon I think relative to the

1403
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:09,514
training center.

1404
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,490
And when you say mobile units,

1405
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:14,460
like how big are these mobile units
and are these effective as the one that

1406
01:23:14,461 --> 01:23:15,294
you're going?

1407
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:17,700
It's a creeper van. You know, it like a

1408
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:23,680
little dish of candy in there.
Yeah. It's like you get in and um,

1409
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:26,620
it's the same exact chair, you
know, and then they have their,

1410
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:30,940
they're trained to a nurse,
nowhere to put it on you. I don't.

1411
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,900
And then even the Eeg, I mean
it's like a, it's a wireless EEG.

1412
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:39,310
So I know that every week they make
you do the EEG, like same time,

1413
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:41,410
a relatively the same time.

1414
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:44,480
So they can keep good track of
what your brain is doing. And,

1415
01:23:44,481 --> 01:23:48,700
and how to prescribe the levels
to be at what on your head. Um,

1416
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:52,810
and I, I think they have
one in, uh, Arizona.

1417
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,820
I know there's one in Texas. Um, I want
to say there's 12 over the country,

1418
01:23:57,821 --> 01:23:59,290
but I can't tell you where.

1419
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:04,280
And the mobile one. I mean, how big is
this? I mean, is this something that uh,

1420
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:07,150
Jim could get and how is
it prohibitively expensive?

1421
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:10,620
I want to say again,
I might be full of Shit,

1422
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:13,890
but I think they're like
$100,000 for that machine.

1423
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:18,750
But I do know that they're being, um,
insurance will cover it because, uh,

1424
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:23,670
for the insurance will
cover it for Migraine,

1425
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:24,930
uh,

1426
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:29,610
PTSD and autism I think.

1427
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,240
I think that insurance will
cover it for that, but then, um,

1428
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:36,390
tricare's also accepting
them as an insurance as well.

1429
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:40,820
Wow. And so when they're doing
this to you and you know,

1430
01:24:40,821 --> 01:24:42,740
you said you got it in August,

1431
01:24:42,741 --> 01:24:46,340
you started doing it and you started
seeing improvements after he said four

1432
01:24:46,341 --> 01:24:47,174
weeks.

1433
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:50,120
Yeah, four weeks was like the
first time I saw improvements.

1434
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:52,550
And then the bigger improvements
where caming leader. Yeah.

1435
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,850
Does it, does it keep
getting better? I mean,

1436
01:24:54,851 --> 01:24:56,500
is it better now than it was last month?

1437
01:24:56,590 --> 01:25:01,020
Yeah, I mean, to the point where I
can, I'm, I'm okay not going for three,

1438
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:03,340
four weeks, you know, like, like I said,

1439
01:25:03,341 --> 01:25:06,430
these last few weeks I've been all about
me getting everything right to be in

1440
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:07,540
training camp right now.

1441
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,700
So you feel right now like
you felt before the news,

1442
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,530
right. In the way I'm changing. Like
I'm having fun with it again. Like I'm,

1443
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:16,820
I'm watching people,
I'm like fucking with them.

1444
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:20,450
Like I'll get them to step that way and
then I'll step that way and then I'll be

1445
01:25:20,451 --> 01:25:24,020
very satisfied. Oh my God. Especially
on for a while. Yeah, it was gone. And,

1446
01:25:24,021 --> 01:25:29,021
and like that is the art to me
is the games and the playing and,

1447
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:34,220
and the like getting you to do this
so I can do that. And then, you know,

1448
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:39,050
like that was what was fun. Yeah. Good.
Getting in a fight is not fun. Right.

1449
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:42,530
But the chess, that's
what's fun. The game, like,

1450
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,800
like making the oohs and the Ahs and
the crowd happen because you know some

1451
01:25:48,171 --> 01:25:52,250
gangster shit, you know what I mean?
Like that's fun. That part's fun.

1452
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:56,270
Going in and getting cut up and bloody
and having headaches and like your ankle

1453
01:25:56,271 --> 01:26:00,380
hurts for a month and it's not fun.
No one wants to do that on purpose.

1454
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:01,400
You know,

1455
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:05,090
I want to go in and do what I can not
get touched and then have it go on a

1456
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:06,440
highlight reel,
you know?

1457
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:10,550
And that wasn't happening for awhile and
even on this last one, it was just like,

1458
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:14,690
man, I felt better. I
totally felt better and, and,

1459
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,500
but what I needed to change wasn't that,
that that was fine.

1460
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,300
What I need to change as is other things
that I'm changing and I am, and again,

1461
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:24,710
like if that's how I have to learn it,
cool.

1462
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,560
But like it's all part of the process,
you know,

1463
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:32,480
I'm not no second in this entire thing.
Have I stopped believing in myself?

1464
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:37,670
No second. The only thing I worried
about was like, it was like, all right,

1465
01:26:37,671 --> 01:26:38,504
am I going to be,

1466
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,810
is my son changing my diapers here in
a few years if I keep doing this shit,

1467
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:44,300
you know, like, I don't
want that, does that,

1468
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,380
but I never stopped believing that this
is what I'm meant to do right here right

1469
01:26:48,381 --> 01:26:48,591
now.

1470
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:52,430
And I have time and I have more fights
and I have everything it takes to go out

1471
01:26:52,431 --> 01:26:56,780
and be every single one of these
girls. Some of them again, you know,

1472
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,970
I do know now when you're in camp,
um,

1473
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:04,570
how many days are you doing?
Two a days.

1474
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,690
Yeah. So some of them are, it'll be like,

1475
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,180
sometimes I'll have to add more
cardio in the morning. And so like,

1476
01:27:12,181 --> 01:27:15,840
if there's fasted cardio, if I'm heavy,
you know, depending on how that goes,

1477
01:27:15,841 --> 01:27:19,310
as it's like a science at about 45.
Like what do you walk around? Yeah.

1478
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:22,530
What do you walk around? I can
get all the way up to like, I've,

1479
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:27,150
I've been all the way up to 76, but that
was before. I didn't know that was when,

1480
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30,930
uh, I didn't, I was, I didn't
know I was hyperthyroid. Oh.

1481
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:35,820
So then we now I was eating like 600
calories a day and doing fasted cardio and

1482
01:27:35,821 --> 01:27:38,760
two workouts in my weight wasn't changing.
My coaches were like,

1483
01:27:38,761 --> 01:27:41,040
what the Fuck's wrong with
you? I'm like, I don't know.

1484
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:44,190
I guess the women in my family
get kind of big, so shit,

1485
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:49,200
maybe it's just not Midwestern style
hitting me now, you know? But, um, no,

1486
01:27:49,201 --> 01:27:51,180
and then when I went and
I got my panels does that,

1487
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:53,710
and like everything was all
screwed up, you know? And then that

1488
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,970
Nunez fine before the Nunez five.
What was the heaviest I got before then?

1489
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:03,040
I had never broke a
hundred. 150 552. Wow. Yeah.

1490
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,420
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1491
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:08,820
Yeah. I walked around like one 40 I
didn't even have to cut cut for Misha.

1492
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:13,440
I walked, I woke up in the morning like
two just didn't eat breakfast. Wow. Yeah.

1493
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:18,900
And then now I'm a big Mama. Jamma
like how I look at food and I get fat.

1494
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:24,970
No, but I don't hate it. Armour
thyroid or something. Um, uh,

1495
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:27,900
leave levothyroxin. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1496
01:28:27,901 --> 01:28:31,430
I take it every morning and like 15
minutes before I can eat anything heavy.

1497
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,360
You should look into armor thyroid.

1498
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,140
It's a thyroid that's made
from a pigsty Roy. And uh,

1499
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,170
apparently it's a,
it's more bio available.

1500
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:45,590
A lot of people have better results with
it. I would, I would, I would try it.

1501
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:47,550
I won't try. I wouldn't try
it now just cause I'm in camp,

1502
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:51,470
but maybe in between the next ones.
Yeah. I'm hyperthyroid to really yeah.

1503
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:54,720
Runs in my family. Yeah. My
family too. I didn't, um,

1504
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,970
I have a weight problem cause
I was working out a lot,

1505
01:28:56,971 --> 01:29:00,770
but I was getting headaches and uh,
I went to a doctor,

1506
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:05,280
get check at the end of the day, like a
say around like seven o'clock at night.

1507
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:10,560
Um, uh, after dinner I would
be so tired that I just like,

1508
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:15,450
I couldn't talk. I just had a lie down.
I couldn't hear it. I couldn't, Oh God,

1509
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:19,260
we're going to talk. Boom. And
I'd go out and it was like, God,

1510
01:29:19,261 --> 01:29:24,000
these headaches are weird. Like this is,
it didn't seem, it didn't seem normal,

1511
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,070
like the, the late, I guess it
was like after dinner headaches,

1512
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:32,100
like right before bed,
it was just, it was,

1513
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:34,440
it was not a normal exhaustion.

1514
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:36,960
I started getting nervous about it
and then when I got to checked out,

1515
01:29:36,961 --> 01:29:40,950
it made sense and my mom has it. My
sister has it, it runs in our family.

1516
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:42,360
Yeah.

1517
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:45,420
I don't know if it's that
genetic for my family,

1518
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:49,020
but you think it's from the head and I,
yeah, I mean it was right away. Yeah.

1519
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:51,400
It was onset. And then, um, you know,

1520
01:29:51,401 --> 01:29:54,330
and then you do these Mris and you do
all of this other stuff and it's like,

1521
01:29:54,331 --> 01:29:54,661
all right,

1522
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:58,290
well there's where your head hurts and
they're just what's wrong and you know,

1523
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:01,690
so I mean, it was just, it's
all too perfect, you know,

1524
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:03,620
puts together your camps,

1525
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:06,710
like who decides what you're going to
do as far as like how much work you're

1526
01:30:06,711 --> 01:30:08,210
going to do,
what kind of training you're going to do,

1527
01:30:08,211 --> 01:30:10,480
where they're going to do sparring
or they're going to do, so

1528
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:14,990
this training camp, um, I, I'm,
I'm outsourcing different things,

1529
01:30:14,991 --> 01:30:16,910
so I have like,
I,

1530
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:20,840
I talked to Eric Delphia
about it and like I said,

1531
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:25,120
I said I wanted to outsource the Jujitsu
and the Moy Tai and those are going to

1532
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:28,330
in itself takes so much
time. Right. And then, um,

1533
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:32,560
my strength and conditioning and I'm doing
with Chad missy is he's, he's mad ass.

1534
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,140
Uh, so my strength and conditioning
coach, Lauren Landauer,

1535
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:36,530
do you know who she is in Colorado?

1536
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:40,710
So he's like family to me or
he's been there for everything.

1537
01:30:40,711 --> 01:30:43,670
Like I didn't even know when he got there.
He, but he was always there, you know,

1538
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:47,570
um, he told me about Chad. Uh,

1539
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:50,660
and so I started doing
strength and conditioning with
him. I'm going to do that,

1540
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,270
um, three days a week. And then, um,

1541
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:57,380
I know that I want to get working with
the more traditional Moitai again.

1542
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:00,590
So I'm working with John
next two days a week, um,

1543
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:05,360
and I think he's going to arrange
my sparring as well. And then, uh,

1544
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,070
Andre Galvao I'm going to try to
work two or three days a week.

1545
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,510
And then,
um,

1546
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:16,940
so I handed all of that information
to Lauren Landau and my other coach,

1547
01:31:16,941 --> 01:31:20,120
my nutrition issues, Josh Ford.
Um, have you seen him before?

1548
01:31:20,121 --> 01:31:22,980
He's got like a tattoo
goatee on his face? No. Um,

1549
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:26,020
he's been doing my nutrition and um,
I've,

1550
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:30,260
he's known me since all I did was
Jujitsu, you know, so he's been around,

1551
01:31:30,261 --> 01:31:31,100
he knows my style.

1552
01:31:31,101 --> 01:31:36,101
He knows me as a crazy fighter and all
of that so close to between Lauren and

1553
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:38,450
Lauren,
Lando and Josh Ford there,

1554
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:41,570
they're putting it together based off of
what they've seen out of me in the past.

1555
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,760
But if you're going to Jujitsu and you're
doing a lot of Jujitsu training and

1556
01:31:44,761 --> 01:31:47,100
then you going to Moitai and
doing Muay Thai training,

1557
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:50,420
when do you get together
and do MMA training? Okay.

1558
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:54,400
That'll be the sparring days and
then there'll be a light spar slack,

1559
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,340
like Kinda drill day in
the middle in there too.

1560
01:31:56,420 --> 01:32:00,340
So are you sparring Moy,
Tai and sparring MMA?

1561
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,750
No,
I'm going to be swearing mme.

1562
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:05,320
So that'll be where I mixed together the
and like that's kind of how I like it

1563
01:32:05,321 --> 01:32:05,620
too.

1564
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:10,620
Like I like doing the disciplines separate
and then and then me finding where to

1565
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:14,320
put them in in a lot of times that's
where my freestyle wrestling just ties it

1566
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:18,280
all together. So you're more training
would basically just be technique drills,

1567
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:19,720
Thom Mayne,

1568
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:24,720
a Ninja moves on that and
your moves and then Jujitsu,

1569
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,440
are you going gear? No, gay.

1570
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:31,690
I did know Gif or I did give for like
the past four weeks and yeah, fuck man,

1571
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:33,460
shit hurts your feelings.

1572
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:38,460
But then obviously it's more
practical to do with the,

1573
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:41,310
to do the Nogi and now they
took the g off of me and man,

1574
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,980
I'm like a thousand miles an hour. I'm
so happy with myself. Slippery. Yeah.

1575
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:49,270
I'm like, you can't grab my
share. And what about wrestling?

1576
01:32:49,271 --> 01:32:52,900
Are you doing any wrestling
training? That part I, I will.

1577
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:56,530
I still got to figure it out down in
San Diego. I want a freestyle wrestler.

1578
01:32:56,531 --> 01:33:01,460
I'm not like, I got a great shot, I'm
good at shots and whatever, but I'm,

1579
01:33:01,461 --> 01:33:05,700
I'm way more about throws.
Like I like there,

1580
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:08,890
there's so much more efficient from,
yeah, I got awesome hips forum in.

1581
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:13,300
It's just like, man, they're,
they're high risk, high reward,

1582
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:15,970
but it's my funky style. Like
I just get them done. Right.

1583
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,540
And it's so much less effort when you
taught someone over their head on the

1584
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:21,250
ground and they don't know
where they are for a minute.

1585
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:24,490
There's so much to capitalize on there
with the equilibrium just off. And like,

1586
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:26,440
those are things I like,
like I count on,

1587
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:30,360
so I need to find that
freestyle situation yet. Um,

1588
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:33,190
I have good freestyle wrestling myself,
but obviously like,

1589
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:36,640
like it's good to stay on top of those.
Like it's my strength,

1590
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:40,210
but I need to keep my strength strong.
So I'm looking,

1591
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:43,120
I'm going to make that happen.
So what do you walk around that?

1592
01:33:43,121 --> 01:33:47,380
Right now I'm like one 55 and 56,

1593
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:51,640
seven 45 is a possibility.
Yeah. I mean, and I, I've,

1594
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,070
I've wanted to go there as
well. I mean, like I said,

1595
01:33:54,071 --> 01:33:57,970
not having that fluid on our brains
when we fight kind of bugs me.

1596
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:02,770
Like if I can walk down and one 45 and
eat breakfast, like, yeah. I mean I won't,

1597
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:07,450
I'm like eating clean eating right
everything perfect. I'm one 55.

1598
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:09,070
Yeah, because I watched one of the, uh,

1599
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:13,390
they had a video of Cyborg cutting
weight to make one 40 [inaudible] which

1600
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:16,030
didn't make any sense. There wasn't
even a weight class for one 40. Yeah,

1601
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:16,720
they were,

1602
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:20,410
I don't know what the fuck they were doing
with her or they were trying to prime

1603
01:34:20,411 --> 01:34:24,130
her for one 35 or seeing if
she could make one 35. Yeah.

1604
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:28,720
But she was like weeping and it looked
like she was dying and like what the fuck

1605
01:34:28,721 --> 01:34:29,554
man?
Yeah.

1606
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:33,120
Did she do the water cut and
that one like the, the bathtub?

1607
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:37,260
Well she did a lot of shit
but it was just hard to watch.

1608
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:39,760
And she gets big too.
Like they uh,

1609
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:41,970
I'm friends with the way
I'll be who's her boyfriend?

1610
01:34:41,971 --> 01:34:45,750
And he like hit me up when I
was supposed to fight Ronda,

1611
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:49,140
they were hitting me up during
my training camp. Like, Hey,

1612
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,370
cause I think they have,

1613
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:53,730
obviously they have beef and I think they
wanted it to be like kind of political,

1614
01:34:53,731 --> 01:34:57,530
but I'm just like not in to that. But
they were like, hey, how about Chris?

1615
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:58,040
You do you have

1616
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,000
any girl training partners?

1617
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:02,930
How about Chris come train with you to
get ready for Rhonda? And I was like, oh,

1618
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:07,250
maybe. I mean, how big is she? And they're
like, like, oh, one 82 and 83. And like,

1619
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:10,460
what, what is the, how does that help me?

1620
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:16,870
Another big motherfucker on me.
Like, Oh God. I'm like, um, thanks.

1621
01:35:16,871 --> 01:35:21,140
But like I got Neil Magni right there.
Dude over like these,

1622
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:25,960
those guys are one 82 yeah, I'm not
paying her hotel. She so fucking big.

1623
01:35:25,961 --> 01:35:29,950
That's so crazy. I mean, she really,
she probably be fighting one 65 yeah.

1624
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:34,510
And there there's a 55 you know,
common, hopefully. Yeah. I mean,

1625
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:38,170
I just don't know. I mean, there's
only so many 40 fives. I mean,

1626
01:35:38,171 --> 01:35:42,400
she's obviously got the belt at 45 but
I think even 45 is a brutal struggle for

1627
01:35:42,401 --> 01:35:47,200
her. And you know, as you said, you
could only do that so many times.

1628
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:51,310
It's taking a little bit of your life.
Every time you do that you're,

1629
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:53,360
you're chipping away at Oregon.
Yeah.

1630
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:54,780
And I just remember like,

1631
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:59,990
I remember coming into MMA and like
I used to cut to one 25 like dying,

1632
01:36:00,031 --> 01:36:01,830
dying and that,
so I was,

1633
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:07,020
I wanted to be ranked number one at one
25 that it was my goal before I moved up.

1634
01:36:07,021 --> 01:36:11,460
And like I, I did, I was ranked number
one, their beat everybody I could be.

1635
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:15,400
And then it was just kind of like the
last time I made one 25 I just, I,

1636
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:20,410
I fought a girl named to k Ohashi from
Japan and I remember it was like last

1637
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,160
minute cause I suppose to fight a girl,

1638
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:25,980
something happened to her and
then they replaced her with Tko.

1639
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:31,340
And I just remember being so happy that
we were at altitude because I was like,

1640
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:35,190
I think I had a heat stroke at the,
the water cut,

1641
01:36:35,191 --> 01:36:40,020
like the bathtub cut because I was
in the water for like 20 minutes.

1642
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:43,650
And I remember at 10 minutes I was like,
something's wrong, something's wrong,

1643
01:36:43,651 --> 01:36:46,320
something's wrong. And they're like,
you have to stay, you have to stay.

1644
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:50,190
And so the 20 minute line,
I like dove like a salmon,

1645
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:51,780
like out of the water.

1646
01:36:51,781 --> 01:36:56,280
And I passed out on my floor and they
gave no shits that my managers there and

1647
01:36:56,281 --> 01:36:58,770
I'm naked and like I don't,
I don't know,

1648
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:02,330
I'm out to the point where they're doing
the knuckle rub on my sternum, you know,

1649
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:06,570
to try to get me up and then um,
I'd rub on your skin, you know,

1650
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,830
trying to wake you up. That's
how they wake you up. Yeah.

1651
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,760
It's like in your sternum. Yeah. Cause
it's like something with the nerves hero,

1652
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:15,090
like hit your adrenaline
awake is crisis so bad.

1653
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,980
And so I'm up and I'm like,

1654
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,770
you know your hands and arms are
tingling and everything cause you're like

1655
01:37:19,771 --> 01:37:23,400
waking up, you know. And I'm like, I
don't want to get back in that bathtub.

1656
01:37:23,490 --> 01:37:27,300
Like put the sauna suit on me. I don't
like put it on me. I don't, you know,

1657
01:37:27,301 --> 01:37:31,320
so not that that like,
I mean health wise I was not okay,

1658
01:37:31,321 --> 01:37:32,970
but it was like I'm not
getting back in there.

1659
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:37,260
So they put this on a suit on me
and my hands are like freaking out,

1660
01:37:37,261 --> 01:37:42,261
like doing this weird shaky like t rex
arm thing and cramping so bad in my feet

1661
01:37:43,381 --> 01:37:44,970
were doing the same thing.
But it was like,

1662
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:49,350
like they had to cover me in the blankets
and put all of the stuff on me to keep

1663
01:37:49,351 --> 01:37:54,150
me hot cause I was not getting back in
that hot tub or the bathtub is terrible.

1664
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:57,420
And after that, like I remember I
felt it in the fight and I was like,

1665
01:37:57,421 --> 01:38:01,830
I'm so glad we're at altitude cause I
feel horrible. I can't do this again.

1666
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:06,030
And then I went up to 35.
Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yeah.

1667
01:38:06,610 --> 01:38:11,010
Is the worst part of fighting. It really
is. And it's so, it's so unnecessary.

1668
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:15,300
There's gotta be, I mean, what one FC
is doing, they've got some, uh, they're,

1669
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:19,350
they're eliminating weight cuts by
doing hydration tests and testing people

1670
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:22,080
several times during the camp,
finding out what your way,

1671
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:26,820
finding out what your actual weight is.
And Ben asked for him, went into, uh, the,

1672
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:31,080
the, the way they're doing it in
detail when I did a podcast with him,

1673
01:38:31,081 --> 01:38:32,970
but that seems to be the way,

1674
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:35,600
and they made everybody move
up a weight class essentially.

1675
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:40,170
I mean, and that's the thing is I, okay,
like contract contracts can still exist,

1676
01:38:40,171 --> 01:38:43,590
but maybe you're just contracted as a
fighter and you have to fight certain

1677
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:45,690
amounts of time a year or or whatever.

1678
01:38:45,691 --> 01:38:48,480
But to have people contracted
to weight classes is like,

1679
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:52,290
it's hurting the sport and it's obviously
hurting fighters individually as well.

1680
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:53,310
But like,

1681
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:56,800
it's just unnecessary. Well,
you should do as fuck. I mean,

1682
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:59,940
it'll be way more weight classes.
There should be more weight classes.

1683
01:38:59,941 --> 01:39:04,290
So there's more opportunities and you
should be fighting what you are when

1684
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,350
you're healthy. It's
hard enough. Well, fine.

1685
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:08,770
And I think especially
because the sport is, we can,

1686
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,920
I mean it's very blatantly
clear that it's, it's,

1687
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:14,140
this is not a bracketed sport.

1688
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:18,400
Like this is an entertainment sports now
it's clear like we're doing what puts

1689
01:39:18,401 --> 01:39:22,450
butts in the seats, right?
We're doing what's best for
the fans. So at that point,

1690
01:39:22,451 --> 01:39:25,420
what are these divisions really matter?
It's about the matchup, you know,

1691
01:39:25,421 --> 01:39:28,110
you can throw a belt on it,
any fight these days, like,

1692
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:31,360
so I think if we're going
to evolve the sport to,

1693
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:35,170
to having entertaining fights
or entertainment type fights,

1694
01:39:35,171 --> 01:39:39,730
like we should just evolve
the, the contracts to that
as well. Like, shit, I mean,

1695
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,540
it'll still save the entertainment
value. Like, look, you can get a,

1696
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:48,500
or catch weights even like, what do you
guys want to agree on? You know? Right.

1697
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:51,520
Like who's down for what?
If you had an ideal weight,

1698
01:39:51,521 --> 01:39:55,360
what would it be to fight out? Yes. Uh,

1699
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,710
probably 45, 45. Yeah.

1700
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:04,450
I feel like I'm skinny enough that I'm
like flying squirrel, flexible stuff,

1701
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:09,550
you know, but, uh, but still a
hell of a strong, you know? Um,

1702
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:12,340
but when you're dealing with someone,
like Cyborg is coming down from one 80.

1703
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:18,390
That's the thing that was me healthy.
Like it don't matter. Like, um,

1704
01:40:18,490 --> 01:40:21,600
I'm the water, she's a
rock, you know? And that,

1705
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:24,700
that's something I remember thinking when
I was going into 20 fives. It's like,

1706
01:40:24,701 --> 01:40:28,750
I'm going to be huge against all
these girls, you know, like they,

1707
01:40:28,751 --> 01:40:32,710
they may not be as dehydrated and fucked
up is me, but I can hold them down,

1708
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:37,180
you know, and, and I can do
what I want and eventually
break them. Right. You know,

1709
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:42,280
and she's, um, she's got that in
her back pocket too. Yeah. But like,

1710
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:46,810
you know, you get the, I thought
watching the Tonya Avenger fight,

1711
01:40:46,811 --> 01:40:49,720
like there was a lot of things that I,

1712
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:54,040
I saw in that fight against Chris and
I was like, damn, like that, that right

1713
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,540
there, there's, there's, uh, there's,

1714
01:40:55,570 --> 01:41:00,490
there's something I could do there
to me seemed like Chris is being very

1715
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:04,810
cautious and conservative and that she
was just picking her shots and just

1716
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:06,340
trying to be very professional.

1717
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:11,550
Like the way she was fighting was not
like this marauding rampaging destroy or

1718
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:13,240
like we've seen in some
of her other fights,

1719
01:41:13,241 --> 01:41:16,690
she fought much more technical and just,

1720
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:21,130
and Tanya evenger was throwing
wild fucking barstool type shit.

1721
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,780
She was just, she, her hands were
down. She's whinging big bombs.

1722
01:41:24,781 --> 01:41:27,520
She knew she had to go for
broke. And you know, Tonya,

1723
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,740
every Jew tough as fuck
just to take that fight.

1724
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:33,280
I mean the difference in size was so
apparent between the two of them when he

1725
01:41:33,281 --> 01:41:38,140
saw them inside the cage and you know,
is just, just a really tough woman.

1726
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:43,360
But her style, she was just trying to
be unpredictable and wild, you know?

1727
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:47,020
And cyborg was just moving in,
let just real,

1728
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,170
real professional and technical.
I felt like she was cautious.

1729
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:54,700
I mean he was a big fight for her too,
you know? Yeah, yeah. That was the first,

1730
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:59,530
was that the first
defense? What was that? No,

1731
01:41:59,531 --> 01:42:03,450
that was the first ballot because her
winning the belt for the belt. Right.

1732
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,480
And then that didn't happen again. Yeah.
And there may, it was like, see Ya.

1733
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:12,460
Germania randomly is like not interested.
Yeah. Wait, does she go there? She said,

1734
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:15,550
oh she's still fighting.
Well she remember right after the fight,

1735
01:42:15,551 --> 01:42:19,180
I interviewed her after she won.
First of all, that fight bothered me.

1736
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:22,960
It bothered me a lot cause she
hit Holly after the bell twice,

1737
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:28,120
one hard and really rocked her. And
I watched that. I was like, fuck man,

1738
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:30,170
that was a big shot.
And like you,

1739
01:42:30,171 --> 01:42:32,710
you could say you accidentally
did it once maybe,

1740
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:36,130
but she did it twice and
one time hurt her bad.

1741
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:40,750
And even so when I watched the
fight, I'm like, that's the, the,

1742
01:42:40,751 --> 01:42:43,870
the times when she hurt
Holly was after the bell,

1743
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,590
but Holly fucked her up twice in that
fight. She hit her with that question.

1744
01:42:47,591 --> 01:42:51,340
Mark kick cracked her and rocked her and
then she hit her with a straight left

1745
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:52,630
hand and dropped her too.

1746
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:56,470
I felt like Holly deserved the nod in
that fight and I definitely think she

1747
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:58,420
deserved the nod if you take points away,

1748
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,220
which I definitely think
she should've taken.

1749
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:03,520
She hadn't points taken away from her.
I just think I just didn't,

1750
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:07,900
it didn't sit with me well, and then
after the fight she said she needed,

1751
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:12,220
when I asked her about Cyborg, she's like,
yeah, I'm getting surgery. She's like,

1752
01:43:12,221 --> 01:43:15,370
I'm good. I got something wrong with my
thumb or something. So I was like, okay,

1753
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:18,990
she's going to get some surgery. And
then, then it became a ped issue.

1754
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:21,790
She said the Cyborg is
a lifetime ped cheater,

1755
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:25,240
that she's a performance enhancing drug
user and that everybody knows it and

1756
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:26,110
she's not gonna fight her.

1757
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:30,340
So she basically just gave up her
title and went back down to 35 I think.

1758
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:32,980
So she is fighting again.

1759
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:36,580
I don't know if she went and got surgery
on whatever it was gone going on with

1760
01:43:36,581 --> 01:43:40,630
her hand, but she is going to fight again.
But she hasn't since I don't believe.

1761
01:43:42,370 --> 01:43:45,850
I don't think so. Anything, see if he
could find that Germane to random me.

1762
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:47,350
See what she's,
who she's fighting next.

1763
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:52,820
She hasn't tweeted since November about
a fight then. Damn, November. Yeah,

1764
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:56,810
that didn't happen. See, that's the
person not investing in social media.

1765
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,440
Are you doing it right? Are you
doing it wrong? No. No. She was like,

1766
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:03,230
I'm just not interested in this anymore.

1767
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:08,450
Which is crazy because this is how
fucking Tufts cyborg is Germane to random.

1768
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:12,790
He fought a dude and coyote them. I mean
there's a Thai fight with her fighting.

1769
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:13,880
Yeah.

1770
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:18,880
I remember when I first started fighting
and like getting pointed at looking at

1771
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:22,970
like that. Like, here's why you want to
learn white tie. And I was watching her,

1772
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:23,870
I was like,
that girl is,

1773
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:28,160
she's looking dance to some wars
and she's like older too. I mean,

1774
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:31,760
I can't say older. I'm like one of the
older ones now, but she older than me,

1775
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:37,100
but she, um, she fucked up a dude.
She Kao to is tray right hand?

1776
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:38,600
I mean it's a,
I mean,

1777
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:42,740
and then if she fought a guy like knew
it was a guy signed up to fight a guy I

1778
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:46,760
fought on beat him and they're like
Cyborg. Yeah, I'm not doing that.

1779
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:52,340
That's how scared she is a Cyborg
and I get it. I fucking get it.

1780
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,030
Cyborg walking around 182 pounds.
I get it.

1781
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:00,300
I mean,

1782
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:05,300
it's a really open division one
45 right now and Megan Anderson,

1783
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:08,960
it's about to fight.
Is that at 45 85 I believe that's it.

1784
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:11,390
45 Megan innocence.
Big Girl.

1785
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:16,670
But girl legit 45 [inaudible] she's,
she's strong.

1786
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:21,680
She's in her prime. She's really tough.
She's good at everything. You know,

1787
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:26,710
she's a legit girl fighting Holly
in her first fight in the UFC. Also,

1788
01:45:26,711 --> 01:45:29,390
it shows how much they think of her,
but I mean,

1789
01:45:29,391 --> 01:45:33,030
how many fighters do they have at
45 he's like fucking three mean.

1790
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:37,310
Who the fuck is there? You've got
Holly who fought Cyborg and lost,

1791
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,130
and then you know w what else you got?

1792
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:44,600
You got Megan Anderson who was over in
Invicta and most people other than the

1793
01:45:44,601 --> 01:45:47,090
hardcore fans don't know about her.
You know?

1794
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:50,780
And she was trying to get her name
out there. So what do we got here?

1795
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:54,410
Is that the whole division?
The whole division?

1796
01:45:55,610 --> 01:46:00,230
Jesus Christ. Oh yeah, I know.
Well, Yana fought Cyborg.

1797
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:04,950
She little, isn't she? She got
nuked. Yeah. That was a, I mean,

1798
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,450
she did her best, right? She, when did
she fight Cyborg? Same night. I thought

1799
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:15,290
she looked good until
Cyborg got ahold of her.

1800
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,740
It's just like one of those things where
when Cyborg starts landing on girls who

1801
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:22,970
see the look in their face, what in
the fuck? What am I doing in here?

1802
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:29,090
I mean, I was most impressed with
Cyborg on her kickboxing loss when she,

1803
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:32,000
when she fought jewelry and a barge.
Did you ever see that fight?

1804
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:36,470
She fought her in Moitai Terina
bars is up fucking beast, man.

1805
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:41,530
I need her. The room in the face.
Yeah. Bars knocked her down with a,

1806
01:46:41,531 --> 01:46:46,531
a front kick to the face and she dropped
her and still cyborg was still chasing

1807
01:46:47,121 --> 01:46:51,270
after her for every fucking round. Yeah.
I was like dot girls. I mean, she's,

1808
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:56,100
she's big and she's strong and she's,
but mentally she's tough too.

1809
01:46:56,190 --> 01:47:00,270
Like she's, I mean to just a fight
that girl at during the bars had,

1810
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:05,370
she had I think almost three years
without a fight where she couldn't get a

1811
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:10,371
fight because nobody wants to fight her
because she's just a fucking bad ass Moy

1812
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:15,180
Thai fighter real long and tall and just
classic Dutch style Moy Tai, you know,

1813
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:19,380
and um, cyborg stepped up
fodder in lion fight. I mean,

1814
01:47:19,381 --> 01:47:24,120
when she was the most feared MMA
fighter in the world and said, fuck it,

1815
01:47:24,121 --> 01:47:25,230
I'll take a Moitai fight.

1816
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:30,630
Like zero Moitai professional fights
fought like one of the best girls ever.

1817
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:35,280
It's really pretty admirable. You know
how bad ass she is in that regard.

1818
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:39,870
It's cool. But you know, when you
have a division that's that small,

1819
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:43,260
it's like what, what do they
do? You know what I mean?

1820
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,050
What are you going to grow the girls,
make them get bigger, like, hey,

1821
01:47:46,051 --> 01:47:51,030
girls want some food. Hey, you know,

1822
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:52,260
I mean this isn't,

1823
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:56,730
this isn't the pride days where they can
just fill them up with, um, you know,

1824
01:47:56,790 --> 01:48:00,810
whatever the Fuck Gabi Garcia is on know,
toss him out there.

1825
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:02,790
You'd hate to have to be legit,
you know,

1826
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:07,670
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah. I mean it's, it's a,

1827
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:12,680
it's a weird situation cause I, I mean
I don't, I don't follow enough to,

1828
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,180
to know what is out there to follow

1829
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:21,020
victor or do you pay
attention to any other, uh,
organizations outside of the UFC?

1830
01:48:21,110 --> 01:48:25,040
No. No. I'm going and honestly, I
don't watch the UFC that much either.

1831
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:28,490
Cause I like, I don't have
cable. Like don't know,

1832
01:48:28,491 --> 01:48:32,870
I have Netflix and a DVD
player, like in school. Yeah,

1833
01:48:32,871 --> 01:48:36,270
we go crazy on eighties and
nineties movies. Wow. Yeah.

1834
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,820
Well look, with Netflix, you
kind kinda don't, I mean,

1835
01:48:38,821 --> 01:48:42,960
you could watch good shit all day
long. You don't really, I mean,

1836
01:48:42,961 --> 01:48:44,910
so many people have
severed their cable now.

1837
01:48:44,911 --> 01:48:47,400
They just don't want to do it anymore.
Fuck a commercial.

1838
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:52,890
And how much is cable? It's like a hundred
bucks a month or something like that.

1839
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:57,850
What's Netflix? 10 yeah, something like
that. Like get the fuck Outta here.

1840
01:48:58,150 --> 01:49:00,630
And it's not like you
run out of shit to watch.

1841
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:05,160
Like you could watch Netflix all day for
the rest of your life and never run out

1842
01:49:05,161 --> 01:49:10,080
of shit to watch. You know? It's a
weird time for those cable companies.

1843
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:14,830
It's like the only thing that really
keeps people buying cable, I think. Or,

1844
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:19,080
or direct TV. One of the big
things is live sports. Yeah.

1845
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:22,740
Like live sports is like one of those
things where you kind of have to have

1846
01:49:22,741 --> 01:49:25,020
direct TV or cable or something

1847
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:29,000
generational too. I mean, there's a
lot of people that just always had it.

1848
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:34,040
Yup. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My
generation, these young kids,

1849
01:49:34,041 --> 01:49:36,250
they don't give a fuck about it.
Yeah.

1850
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:41,720
John Young kids don't watch CBS and like,
see what the fuck is that?

1851
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:46,100
And if the weird thing is if you watch
regular TV now it's seems like you're

1852
01:49:46,101 --> 01:49:49,240
watching a machine.
Like you're watching some,

1853
01:49:49,241 --> 01:49:51,340
some shit from like a bygone error,

1854
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:54,400
like laugh tracks and then cut
to commercials. They're like,

1855
01:49:54,401 --> 01:49:58,140
what is this cliff hangers to
be continued? What is this?

1856
01:49:59,070 --> 01:50:03,710
This is weird. So what do you do when
you're not training other than the watch

1857
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:04,623
DVDs?

1858
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:10,150
I'm not really much like I'm trying
to get out in San Diego and like,

1859
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:13,440
like live, you know, in play by the like,

1860
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:17,350
I'll get to the beach when I can try
to soak up the sun and whatever. Um,

1861
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:21,830
really like I have a struggle
because I realized I came here to,

1862
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:23,500
to work.
Like I came here,

1863
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:27,460
I changed in my life to come out here and
be all in and be as successful at this

1864
01:50:27,461 --> 01:50:30,700
as possible.
So my day is about training,

1865
01:50:30,701 --> 01:50:34,900
about doing the like rehabilitation
type things that I need to do and then

1866
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:39,250
making sure my kids' needs are met and
you know, wash, rinse, repeat with that.

1867
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:42,460
Like I recently went to like,

1868
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:47,500
I've been to a couple escape
rooms. That's fun. Yeah.

1869
01:50:47,501 --> 01:50:52,090
They're super fun. Unless
you're not getting out, you
sit there and they're like,

1870
01:50:52,091 --> 01:50:55,970
hey, let's take your picture at the end.
I'm all pissed. I'm still here. Yeah.

1871
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:58,630
Yeah. I didn't get out.
We didn't get out either.

1872
01:50:58,631 --> 01:51:01,720
We got out of one room but it led us
into the second room and we're like,

1873
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,440
yeah, it's hard. I feel like
there's a, there's hard,

1874
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:08,440
it was hard for me being an
athlete because I'm like,
there's harder we can do,

1875
01:51:08,441 --> 01:51:11,350
like I can work harder at this,
but there was no working harder at it.

1876
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,360
Right. It makes you smarter. Yeah.

1877
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:17,000
It's also like weird shit
to put pieces together.

1878
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:22,540
Yeah. And then, um, let's
see, there's like a,

1879
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:23,680
there's like a horse,

1880
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:28,120
a rescue that I go down and I'll like put
time in down there and just kinda like

1881
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:32,290
be with the animals and feed them and
like you can re try to rehabilitate them.

1882
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:34,060
Some of them are scary man like,

1883
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:37,000
but it's cool cause they're actually like
something really to be scared of like

1884
01:51:37,001 --> 01:51:39,340
half the shit we're afraid of
is just in our head anyway.

1885
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:43,390
But there's this like gigantic animal
that doesn't know if it wants to kick you.

1886
01:51:43,391 --> 01:51:46,090
I love you. And it's like, you know,

1887
01:51:46,091 --> 01:51:49,270
trying to be friends so you can help
it and teach it. Stuff like that.

1888
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:52,180
That's taken some of my time.
It's been cool.

1889
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:54,930
That is weird with horses,
right? Like you could break them,

1890
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:58,210
you can lasso them and they'll
let you ride them. Like fuck,

1891
01:51:58,950 --> 01:52:03,420
like wild horses. People go out and
catch wild horses and ride them around.

1892
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:08,190
Like what other fucking animal can
you do that too? That's so strange.

1893
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:12,750
You know like that is really strange
that you could like get a horse.

1894
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:15,930
He got him in the bar and the horse was
like, fuck you, fuck you. And you're like,

1895
01:52:15,931 --> 01:52:19,710
no, fuck you. You get a rope around them.
And they're like, all right. All right,

1896
01:52:19,711 --> 01:52:21,780
you got me.
You're riding me around now.

1897
01:52:23,310 --> 01:52:25,810
It's very strange.
I mean,

1898
01:52:25,811 --> 01:52:28,830
it would have weird relationship
people have with fucking horses.

1899
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:33,330
It's very strange.
Oh Man.

1900
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:36,780
My friend Whitney Cummings
has a horse and she's all in.

1901
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:40,440
She's all in with his fucking horse.
She rides it bare back. She's like,

1902
01:52:40,441 --> 01:52:41,930
you have to have a
connection with the animal.

1903
01:52:41,931 --> 01:52:46,020
It has to feel you like not a satellite.
Alright, crazy. Absolutely. I've

1904
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:49,400
seen Clint Eastwood movies seems like
he's riding the horse pretty good with a

1905
01:52:49,401 --> 01:52:51,470
saddle on.
She doesn't do that.

1906
01:52:51,471 --> 01:52:54,710
And she rescued this horse and
she'd like on her Instagram,

1907
01:52:54,711 --> 01:52:57,440
she's always like riding around with this
fucking horse and hanging out with it,

1908
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:00,140
you know? And she's like spending
all this time with it. It's like

1909
01:53:00,490 --> 01:53:05,170
it is, I they call it equine therapy
and like, like I was trying to get,

1910
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:08,500
um, just because my brain was
working in all these ways,

1911
01:53:08,501 --> 01:53:12,550
like I got really excited
about that treatment center,
that, um, the mindset place.

1912
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:13,391
And then again,

1913
01:53:13,391 --> 01:53:16,330
there's all those other people in there
that are in there and the veterans and

1914
01:53:16,331 --> 01:53:17,090
stuff. I was like, man,

1915
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:20,650
if I could get someone them down
there working with these horses, one,

1916
01:53:20,651 --> 01:53:23,950
it gives them something to do cause the
ones that are disabled like their hate

1917
01:53:23,951 --> 01:53:26,560
in life and in that place,

1918
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:29,290
like it's awesome because after
a few months of being there,

1919
01:53:29,291 --> 01:53:31,870
they all want to know how
to help their like, like,

1920
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:36,580
tell me what I can do around here,
you know. And, um, even that without,

1921
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:38,350
I'm like, man, if I could
even get them down there,

1922
01:53:38,351 --> 01:53:42,690
like sometimes if all you do at this
place has shovel shit, you know, it's,

1923
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:47,080
it's still like you're around these
horses and um, this place in particular,

1924
01:53:47,081 --> 01:53:50,890
they're all rescues and it's called
Ferdinand's familiar and they've all been

1925
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:54,460
mistreated at some point or they were
trained to be something that they never

1926
01:53:54,461 --> 01:53:55,690
graduated to being.

1927
01:53:55,690 --> 01:54:00,690
And so they were trash and now they need
to turn these horses into like rideable

1928
01:54:01,421 --> 01:54:06,160
like horses or whatever. Like that's
the goal. And then they have this, um,

1929
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:09,970
it's near imperial beach. It's like
on that land, like right on Tiawana.

1930
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,440
So you get,

1931
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:16,510
the goal is to take them on this like
trail that goes all the way to the beach

1932
01:54:16,511 --> 01:54:18,190
and you can ride up and
down the beach like freely.

1933
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:22,070
Can you ride the beach to Tijuana
or is there a wall? Oh yeah,

1934
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:23,540
you can write it both.

1935
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:27,060
And it's like a see through wall
and you see them in through, yeah,

1936
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:30,830
I mean it's just like, it's like
panels. You can see right through it.

1937
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:35,270
Like I went down there and you
could swim around it. Yeah,

1938
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,190
I was thinking that the other day.
I'm like this,

1939
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:41,150
you guys are almost too tempting.
Like I almost want to go over there.

1940
01:54:41,151 --> 01:54:44,510
Is it right here? Yeah, it's there.
That's exactly where we ride.

1941
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:48,440
Fucking strange to me.
That is so God damn strange.

1942
01:54:48,441 --> 01:54:52,400
So which side is Tijuana? This is tia one
or the other side is the United States.

1943
01:54:52,401 --> 01:54:54,380
Right. And yeah, that's
exactly what it looks like.

1944
01:54:54,381 --> 01:54:57,290
They have their little umbrellas.
They're having their little barbecues,

1945
01:54:57,291 --> 01:55:01,670
like Chilean playing music,
having fun. Meanwhile we're
all over. They're like, Huh?

1946
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,380
Like I almost want to try to swim over
just to see if anyone is going to stop

1947
01:55:06,381 --> 01:55:10,970
you because there is a little bit of like,
if you keep going up that fence,

1948
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:15,320
they have like one car with
one dude who's watching,

1949
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:19,760
who's watching the border patrol. And it
seems so easy to get here from Mexico,

1950
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:23,450
right? All you have to. Oh,
and how deep can that fence go?

1951
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:28,910
Yeah. How deep can it go? I mean,

1952
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:32,600
it's put up here, put up your umbrella
and like a special angle and you're good.

1953
01:55:32,601 --> 01:55:36,200
We'll just climb.
This doesn't seem like it's impossible.

1954
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:40,250
I mean, I'm not the best climber in
the world by fucking guarantee you.

1955
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:43,980
I can make it over that fence a hundred
percent look. Yeah, you just grab a

1956
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,320
whole the Av, some gloves on so
you don't fuck. You're hands on.

1957
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:50,580
You're going to have to do some soft
soft sand Shane and cause that sprint

1958
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:53,330
afterwards. Again, bend your
legs out. Yeah, the sports world,

1959
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,580
but unless they're on Dune buggies,
they're not going to catch you.

1960
01:55:56,581 --> 01:56:00,570
Those fat fucks. I just, I
feel like swimming is the move.

1961
01:56:00,990 --> 01:56:03,610
Why climate? You just swim a couple
of hundred yards over. Yeah, right.

1962
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:07,380
It's like 200 yards.
Maybe it shit go left and then come back.

1963
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:11,580
It's so weird that like build that wall,
build that wall.

1964
01:56:11,581 --> 01:56:14,460
People are so crazy.
The whole thing is so strange.

1965
01:56:14,490 --> 01:56:18,630
I think one day we're going to look back
on countries like the human race one.

1966
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:21,720
I think one of the things that's happening
to the human race for sure is that

1967
01:56:21,721 --> 01:56:24,600
we're getting closer to each
other. We're getting, we can,

1968
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:29,700
like I'll read like tweets that someone
will post in Spanish or in Chinese or

1969
01:56:29,701 --> 01:56:34,020
whatever and you just press translate
and then you get to read it, you know,

1970
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:37,440
translate to English. And
I'm like, wow, there it is. I
could read this guy's words.

1971
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:41,450
And they have this thing called the
Google Pixel. Uh, it's uh, you know,

1972
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:45,090
it's a phone and um,
they have these pixel buds,

1973
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:49,110
these earbuds and these earbuds
will translate in real time.

1974
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:52,530
Like you could say some shit to me in
Spanish and it'll translate it in realtime

1975
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:53,790
to English.
Yeah.

1976
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:57,720
And how long is it going to be before
that's way better and that we're going to

1977
01:56:57,721 --> 01:56:59,250
realize that countries are stupid.

1978
01:56:59,470 --> 01:57:02,350
See, but I think, I mean, I agree
on that on the social media side.

1979
01:57:02,351 --> 01:57:05,690
Like I feel like social media has
made that connection for us on that,

1980
01:57:05,691 --> 01:57:09,110
like that I guess mental,
social side or whatever.

1981
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:13,220
But us as humans individually, like here
and now, right next to each other. Like,

1982
01:57:13,221 --> 01:57:17,300
I feel a huge disconnect, like
look at, I mean a century ago,

1983
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:21,650
more than less than, like you knew
who the town butcher was, right?

1984
01:57:21,651 --> 01:57:25,940
He knew who the blacksmith was. You knew
who the mayor was like you knew like,

1985
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:29,300
and everybody had their position,
your kids were safe to run around,

1986
01:57:29,301 --> 01:57:30,134
like everything.

1987
01:57:30,170 --> 01:57:34,140
Like everyone knew and there was
value to every single person for,

1988
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:37,190
for what it is that they're,
their craft was or who they are.

1989
01:57:37,191 --> 01:57:41,060
And now no one knows anyone.
And like people don't want to like,

1990
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:45,230
like I almost feel weird sometimes
that like, you know, my kids,

1991
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:49,700
my kid doesn't see all of
the same pictures that I
see because I have Facebook

1992
01:57:49,701 --> 01:57:52,430
and he doesn't or you know,
but I'm not ready,

1993
01:57:52,431 --> 01:57:56,690
like to have my kid exposed to
the library right there, you know?

1994
01:57:56,690 --> 01:58:00,320
And it's a terrible thing for kids to be
exposed to. Yeah. And, and I think that,

1995
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:03,770
um, you know, so like shoulder
to shoulder person, a person,

1996
01:58:03,771 --> 01:58:07,340
I feel like a bit of a disconnect,
you know? But social media,

1997
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:10,730
like we get to share information
sometimes not good information.

1998
01:58:10,731 --> 01:58:14,420
Sometimes you get information like the
fact that people are communicating I

1999
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:16,210
think is important. Um, it's,

2000
01:58:16,211 --> 01:58:19,580
it's making people take stands on
things that they're all finding out. Oh,

2001
01:58:19,581 --> 01:58:23,510
you believe that too? Or I think that
too, like cool. Like I can find my people,

2002
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:27,230
you know, but on the actual
like oxytocin, like social side,

2003
01:58:27,231 --> 01:58:28,850
people actually getting
to know each other,

2004
01:58:28,851 --> 01:58:33,460
like those like intimate relationships.
Like I feel like that part is,

2005
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:35,170
is suffering a little bit from it.

2006
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:38,300
Yeah. I think that's suffering
a little bit in real life. Um,

2007
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:40,070
because people were in cars,

2008
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:43,870
they're in traffic isolated than they go
to work and then a cubicle all day and

2009
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:46,720
they'd get home and they're in their
apartment or their house. Yeah.

2010
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:51,040
There's not a lot of like interaction
with people and it's just stink.

2011
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:54,280
This is just a side effect of modern life,
you know?

2012
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:57,130
And it's weird that there's so many,
like in La,

2013
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,610
there's so many people next to each other
and almost nobody knows their neighbor.

2014
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:02,450
It's a very strange,
right.

2015
01:59:02,670 --> 01:59:06,340
But what I'm talking about is I think
countries are stupid, like states.

2016
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:07,870
I think countries like states,

2017
01:59:07,871 --> 01:59:11,170
like I think we should build a wall over
Florida before we should build a wall

2018
01:59:11,171 --> 01:59:15,660
for Mexico. I mean, it's a,
Florida is a state, right?

2019
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:20,780
But Florida is just as alien as like
say Finland or something like that.

2020
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,580
I mean it's just, just the fact that
you can move out of Florida and like,

2021
01:59:24,581 --> 01:59:25,660
Fuck Florida, man, I'm going to,

2022
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:29,410
I'm going to move to Atlanta and he'd
go up there and like, nobody stops you.

2023
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:33,580
You just go. But if you're in
Tiawana like you like no dog,

2024
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:37,770
there's a fence up your pitch like
this. No, there's no crossing did to,

2025
01:59:37,771 --> 01:59:41,980
to me that seems like super fucking
strange and almost like guaranteeing that

2026
01:59:41,981 --> 01:59:45,970
those spots are fucked forever and the
only way those anything's ever going to

2027
01:59:45,971 --> 01:59:49,090
level out is if you let anybody
travel wherever they want.

2028
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:52,540
And nobody's willing to do that because
it might fuck up the good spots.

2029
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:56,470
Like la Jolla would be like,
no, no, no. You can't just
like, yeah, we're not equal.

2030
01:59:56,570 --> 01:59:59,830
Yeah. You can't just come over
from, I mean you think about it,

2031
01:59:59,831 --> 02:00:03,040
La Jolla has some of the wealthiest
real estate in the world. Right.

2032
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:06,010
And unbelievable.
Beautiful views.

2033
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:10,660
And you could walk to Mexico
from La Jolla. You could walk,

2034
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:15,070
I mean, what's the distance between
Tijuana and La Jolla? Let's guess.

2035
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:18,410
Let me guess. I'm gonna
say it's 50 miles. Is it 50

2036
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:23,020
I'm going to be 50 no, I, it's not that
many cause it's already it depending on,

2037
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:26,320
oh yeah. I would say it's
a 30 minute drive. Like,

2038
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:31,120
like moderate. Yeah. Normal
speed limit. Yeah. No traffic.

2039
02:00:31,121 --> 02:00:31,954
35 maybe.

2040
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:36,970
So maybe it's 30 miles. So it's like
a marathon, like a marathon run.

2041
02:00:36,971 --> 02:00:41,770
Which people do. They run it all. They've
run marathons. All Tom 2030 to 32 miles.

2042
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:44,890
Nine 30 so you're in fucking Tiawana.

2043
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:48,430
You were in a third world country and
one of the worst neighborhoods of a third

2044
02:00:48,431 --> 02:00:51,220
world country and 32 miles away.

2045
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:56,320
You have like these unbelievable mansions
on these bluffs overlooking the ocean.

2046
02:00:56,650 --> 02:01:01,010
Look Nigga, that shit crazy. That's crazy.

2047
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:05,890
And Clara Natto it's very weird.
Yeah, exactly. It's very weird.

2048
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:07,083
Yeah.

2049
02:01:08,090 --> 02:01:12,960
And, and yeah, that corn auto, the
island, that's all super wealthy people,

2050
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:16,440
right? Yeah. That's where
Dick Cheney lives apparently.

2051
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:20,530
Yeah. They, they have the ability
of shutting that whole island down.

2052
02:01:20,531 --> 02:01:22,840
If there's like vandalism or like,
cause it's,

2053
02:01:22,841 --> 02:01:26,290
it's got its entry and it's out like,
um,

2054
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,130
what is it called way?

2055
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:31,810
So it's not exactly an island
like it does attach to the land.

2056
02:01:31,811 --> 02:01:34,060
What does that call the
peninsula? Yeah. Yeah. So,

2057
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:37,820
but they have an ability,
uh,

2058
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:40,400
both the peninsula edge and

2059
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,190
the bridge to shut it down as a community.

2060
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:45,710
If Shit's going down on the island
and they don't want someone to

2061
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:50,400
get off, that's how rich they are. Yeah.

2062
02:01:50,490 --> 02:01:53,730
It's only one of the wealthiest
places in the world. And another one,

2063
02:01:53,731 --> 02:01:55,950
there's one off sawed off of Miami.

2064
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:59,670
There's like some little tiny island
that's filled only with rich people.

2065
02:01:59,671 --> 02:02:02,010
Star island, I think
so. It was called. Yeah.

2066
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:04,380
It's like one of the most
wealthy places on the planet.

2067
02:02:04,381 --> 02:02:07,410
It's one little spot off Miami
just filled with rich folks.

2068
02:02:07,411 --> 02:02:12,040
Waiting for a hurricane to fuck up though.
Is that it?

2069
02:02:12,041 --> 02:02:16,380
Star island is a tiny neighborhood
of massive houses in drama. Oh,

2070
02:02:16,381 --> 02:02:21,060
there's drama. I only see the big x on it.
Like fuck this place. Okay. Got a drama.

2071
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:24,780
Damn bad ass houses though. But
they have good brunch to, yeah,

2072
02:02:24,781 --> 02:02:28,500
that's a little too. So they have a little
bridge and it's a little tiny island.

2073
02:02:28,630 --> 02:02:33,090
All right. Good luck people.
Weird people are weird cat.

2074
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:36,240
That's not safe. It doesn't
feel safe. Not in Miami.

2075
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:40,770
I'm like that whole crocodiles,
the place is filled with pirates.

2076
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:45,570
That place is filled with weird shit.
It's just Florida is so strong. I love it.

2077
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:50,070
I'm joking around but I hate it. But
I love Miami. I just, it's so strange.

2078
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:51,990
It's such a,
every time I go down there I'm like,

2079
02:02:51,991 --> 02:02:55,530
you should have to have a passport
to come here. This is not America.

2080
02:02:55,531 --> 02:02:58,950
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
It's great, but it's, it's chaos.

2081
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:02,640
But then there's some Florida
spots like we like, okay Pensacola,

2082
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:07,320
if you just go fuck yourself,
would you say it's basically Alabama?

2083
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:09,960
I might as well be.
It might as well we,

2084
02:03:09,961 --> 02:03:14,160
other than Roy Jones jr I mean he came
out of there. You put pence on the map?

2085
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:16,680
Nope.
Do you do any boxing training?

2086
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:18,200
I do.
So I um,

2087
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:22,700
alliance has been real
helpful on my hands.

2088
02:03:22,701 --> 02:03:26,360
Like I would say there's a ton of
improvement as far as that goes. Like,

2089
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:28,520
and I never really
focused on boxing before.

2090
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:33,580
Like I worked Muy Thai and kickboxing
and between Dutch and Thai style,

2091
02:03:34,161 --> 02:03:39,040
you know, and then to go there and have my
hand sharpened was, was pretty cool. Uh,

2092
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:41,390
I just never, um, I,

2093
02:03:41,730 --> 02:03:46,730
it was hard for me to like to relate
boxing to any sport I'd ever done.

2094
02:03:47,961 --> 02:03:52,670
And like as a, as a athlete growing
up as a kid, like if I don't,

2095
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:54,800
if I can't understand
something that I'm learning,

2096
02:03:54,801 --> 02:03:58,640
I try to relate it back to some like
muscle memory of some motion I've done

2097
02:03:58,641 --> 02:04:02,570
before in some other sports like
volleyball or swimming or like what's the

2098
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:06,170
mechanics of how I've moved in,
something that I can even dance,

2099
02:04:06,171 --> 02:04:10,310
like turned into getting like some kind
of value out of so I can learn this

2100
02:04:10,311 --> 02:04:13,670
thing. And like boxing was not like
anything that I'd ever done before.

2101
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:17,210
Like you've never had a predominantly
hands on sport that I was good at.

2102
02:04:17,211 --> 02:04:19,830
So it's been the,
um,

2103
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:25,400
the most, uh, what's
the word? I don't know.

2104
02:04:25,401 --> 02:04:29,210
There's the,
the most work in the less,

2105
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:32,280
the least natural of all
of the disciplines. That's

2106
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:33,770
a come into cause for this word,

2107
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:37,800
but you've trained Moitai so much
tie his hands of it. Right. The

2108
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:41,290
thing I'm excited about, the most
employee ties the clenching and the cakes,

2109
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:46,800
you know, so to set up your wrestling,
right? Yeah. Right. And just having the,

2110
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:50,100
the hips and everything with that, that
came with wrestling and that came with,

2111
02:04:50,530 --> 02:04:54,240
you know, the footwork of, of soccer,
of dance, of all that, stuff like that,

2112
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:58,650
that contributed I think,
easily and translated easily over to that.

2113
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:02,250
But boxing was, um, not so much, you know,

2114
02:05:02,251 --> 02:05:05,850
but part of me also thinks like, you
know, some of that had to come with,

2115
02:05:05,851 --> 02:05:09,660
with learning, like, you, you gotta get
hit to realize you don't want to get hit.

2116
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:13,240
I'm like, I don't, I'm not ready. I
don't want to talk about that. Right.

2117
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:17,270
Like I don't want to get it. So best way
to learn how to move your head. Yeah.

2118
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:20,040
Yeah. And slip and roll with Shit. Yeah.

2119
02:05:20,690 --> 02:05:24,690
It hurts my feelings and get punched
in the face I'm sure. And I'm happy.

2120
02:05:24,691 --> 02:05:28,950
I'm the kind of person that it pisses
off, you know, like, so it makes me,

2121
02:05:28,951 --> 02:05:32,770
it makes me fight harder, you
know? But like it's stunning.

2122
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:34,081
It is stunning.

2123
02:05:34,081 --> 02:05:36,990
Especially when you get one of those good
ones in the nose and now your eyes are

2124
02:05:36,991 --> 02:05:39,820
watering but you're not crying like that.

2125
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:45,210
That weird stinging sensation.
Yeah. Yeah. Learning all of that,

2126
02:05:45,211 --> 02:05:49,320
that, that all was definitely within
the last few years and it's been,

2127
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:53,670
it's been fun. It's been not
fun but fun. When you see like

2128
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:57,130
the evolution, you know, a lot of
fighters are getting into yoga.

2129
02:05:57,131 --> 02:05:59,280
A lot of fighters are doing yoga.

2130
02:05:59,550 --> 02:06:04,350
A lot of fighters are finding that
they have like real benefits and uh,

2131
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:08,210
protecting their back and strengthening
a lot of their joints and their

2132
02:06:08,220 --> 02:06:09,130
ligaments and stuff like that.

2133
02:06:09,350 --> 02:06:09,470
Yeah.

2134
02:06:09,470 --> 02:06:13,660
Do you feel like it's supplemental towards
like the physiology of it or because

2135
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:16,420
it's something as far as
adding to the combative side?

2136
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,730
Uh,
I think both.

2137
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:22,620
I think for sure it's good for
your mental endurance because it's,

2138
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:25,500
it's hard. I mean it seems like
something that should be very easy.

2139
02:06:25,501 --> 02:06:30,220
You hear about Yogi, like, oh, housewives
do that shit, but if you do it 100% in,

2140
02:06:30,221 --> 02:06:31,370
especially hot yoga,

2141
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,100
you're stuck in that fucking box
at 104 degrees for 90 minutes,

2142
02:06:35,101 --> 02:06:36,230
sweating your ass off.
Yeah.

2143
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:39,670
And I'm pissed at about 60
minutes and that one. Yeah.

2144
02:06:39,671 --> 02:06:42,780
So there's definitely some
mental toughness that goes
into the 90 [inaudible]

2145
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:47,970
you endure, you endure a 90 minute hot
yoga class. But I think for your joints,

2146
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:50,490
for,
for your range of motion and flexibility,

2147
02:06:50,491 --> 02:06:53,250
there's almost nothing better
because you're so, so hot and sweaty.

2148
02:06:53,251 --> 02:06:55,950
Everything's loosened up and do,
you can get into like deep,

2149
02:06:55,951 --> 02:06:58,300
deep stretches and deep poses and,

2150
02:06:58,301 --> 02:07:01,800
and also like for your foot
strength and posture and balance,

2151
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:06,330
all that stuff is amazing. Amazing for
your back, strengthening your back,

2152
02:07:06,331 --> 02:07:10,320
your knees. Um, it's really good
for Jujitsu fighters. I mean,

2153
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:11,430
Jujitsu people love it.

2154
02:07:11,820 --> 02:07:16,410
So one of the best things for Jiu Jitsu
because Ju Jitsu so static, you know,

2155
02:07:16,411 --> 02:07:17,011
so much of it,

2156
02:07:17,011 --> 02:07:20,910
it's like holding on and like trying
to advance position and slowly,

2157
02:07:20,911 --> 02:07:25,140
and then there's these bursts of uh,
you know, like explosive movements,

2158
02:07:25,141 --> 02:07:29,490
but so much of it is just
clenching and isometric. Yeah.

2159
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:33,600
So much of it is that, and I think
you really benefit from being able to,

2160
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:38,440
you know, in these yoga poses, holding
these poses for 30 seconds. When you're,

2161
02:07:38,441 --> 02:07:40,870
your body's burning and
you're, you know, you're,

2162
02:07:40,871 --> 02:07:43,330
you're having a difficult
time to standing up.

2163
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:46,570
I think adding the heat
component to it too,

2164
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:48,510
especially if you're a
weight cutting finder,

2165
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:52,960
like getting to know your body and
in teaching it how to sweat, right?

2166
02:07:52,961 --> 02:07:57,340
Like this last training camp was pretty
awesome with that because I got a sauna

2167
02:07:57,341 --> 02:08:00,010
for my,
when I got us on a while ago,

2168
02:08:00,011 --> 02:08:04,600
I was using a red light for healing and
I was using the sauna because I know

2169
02:08:04,601 --> 02:08:08,680
that you can naturally boost your a growth
hormone if you're in that every night

2170
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:10,930
and and help yourself
before you go to sleep.

2171
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:14,380
So I was in that every night.

2172
02:08:14,381 --> 02:08:19,381
I tried to go in for like 45 minutes and
that was so helpful in going into the

2173
02:08:19,721 --> 02:08:21,640
fight week wait, cut. Because it was like,

2174
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:25,750
I know what it feels like when it's time
to get the fuck out and I know what it

2175
02:08:25,751 --> 02:08:27,940
feels like when it's time that I'm like,

2176
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:30,790
that sound like when
I'm dripping like crazy.

2177
02:08:30,791 --> 02:08:35,590
I still got another good 20 minutes of
me sitting here like this, you know?

2178
02:08:35,591 --> 02:08:36,390
And,

2179
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:40,540
and I think it's really hard on fighters
when they're not in a sauna or that hot

2180
02:08:40,541 --> 02:08:44,260
for their entire camp and then they just
expect that out of their body the day

2181
02:08:44,261 --> 02:08:46,090
before a fight. Yeah.
I think you're right.

2182
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:48,790
This is really,
really good benefits as you said,

2183
02:08:48,791 --> 02:08:51,580
two for recovery or reducing inflammation.

2184
02:08:53,070 --> 02:08:54,780
Yeah,
I thought it was hopeful.

2185
02:08:54,781 --> 02:08:58,080
I got a portable sauna to bring up
my fights with me. Oh that's nice.

2186
02:08:58,081 --> 02:09:01,820
Is it one you climb into and like
just your little head sticks out is

2187
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:04,920
uncomfortable as hell cause you can't
lean against anything or it'll burn your

2188
02:09:04,921 --> 02:09:06,560
ass in the chair.
Yeah.

2189
02:09:06,710 --> 02:09:09,960
The chair is like this little half
chair and by that point you're like,

2190
02:09:09,961 --> 02:09:13,590
Oregon's are so depleted in and
you're like leaning all weird anyway.

2191
02:09:13,591 --> 02:09:14,460
So it was just hell.

2192
02:09:14,461 --> 02:09:16,980
But I mean it gets it off and you
don't have to leave your hotel room.

2193
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:20,340
Oh that's nice too. Especially if
you're doing something on the road.

2194
02:09:20,341 --> 02:09:22,440
Like who was it that um,

2195
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:28,550
somebody that somebody was
fighting somewhere and they
didn't have hot water and

2196
02:09:29,011 --> 02:09:31,680
they couldn't make weight because
they didn't have the, the bathtub.

2197
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,890
I think it was a fuck.

2198
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:40,350
I'm trying to think of who it was. Thomas
have been stressful. Yeah, they were,

2199
02:09:40,351 --> 02:09:43,560
I think they were fighting in Brazil and
there was no hot water for some reason.

2200
02:09:43,561 --> 02:09:46,470
Like the hot water was down and
they all like, what in the fuck?

2201
02:09:46,471 --> 02:09:48,600
And they couldn't,
they want one up not making weight.

2202
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:53,010
I don't remember who it was.
I wasn't there for that event.

2203
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:56,760
But I remember thinking like that is one
of the real problems with doing these,

2204
02:09:56,761 --> 02:09:58,340
some of these gigs in the road,
you know,

2205
02:09:58,341 --> 02:10:03,180
you're traveling to these places and
there's no fucking hot water if there's no

2206
02:10:03,181 --> 02:10:05,860
sauna and no hot water.
How he's supposed to make weight.

2207
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:08,720
Oh, and it's awkward to be in
a sauna with your opponent too.

2208
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:14,020
I fought Carina Damn.
Uh, again as a 2,400,

2209
02:10:14,021 --> 02:10:15,490
25,
like a few years ago.

2210
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:21,930
There is Eric Anderson look
show was very respectful.

2211
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:22,980
Damn.

2212
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:27,860
Yeah. Yeah. The is Brazilian.
He knows. He was like, yeah,

2213
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:29,240
yeah,
but we,

2214
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:32,430
we were in North Dakota and we had to
go in and the same song in it became a

2215
02:10:32,431 --> 02:10:34,020
competition there.
I'm like,

2216
02:10:34,050 --> 02:10:37,700
God, I'm not getting out.
And when she, when she,

2217
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:39,380
like there was a point,

2218
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:42,740
like I'm sitting there with my coach
and I'm just like biting down yet,

2219
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:47,180
I don't even know how long we were in, but
it was like hard. It was rough. And, um,

2220
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:50,420
it's Kinda, yeah, exactly.
Like who's going to break
first? Who's gonna go first?

2221
02:10:50,421 --> 02:10:53,420
And she ended up being like, fuck
it. And she goes and she gets out.

2222
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:57,860
And I was like, Oh, you have quit in you.
And I already knew I wanted to fight.

2223
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:02,450
I won the fight. I was like, I saw
everything I needed to see. We're good.

2224
02:11:03,550 --> 02:11:05,510
Crazy.
That's so true.

2225
02:11:06,450 --> 02:11:09,690
Look, there's something to that. I mean,
you definitely don't want to die in there,

2226
02:11:10,530 --> 02:11:13,610
but there's, there's moments when
you're in the sauna, you know,

2227
02:11:13,650 --> 02:11:17,430
I have one here and there's this thing
that happens at like 30 minutes. We like,

2228
02:11:17,431 --> 02:11:21,290
what in the fuck am I doing? Well, you
start fucking weird now. You're like,

2229
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:25,080
I gotta get Outta here. I gotta get Outta
here. It's like claustrophobia. Yeah.

2230
02:11:25,170 --> 02:11:27,690
Like you're, you know that
if you just opened that door,

2231
02:11:27,730 --> 02:11:29,790
this cold air and you're gonna feel great,

2232
02:11:30,110 --> 02:11:33,170
[inaudible] just lost someone
that asks you a question,

2233
02:11:33,180 --> 02:11:35,790
just hoping it just opens the door
for a second. Let's open a door.

2234
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:38,640
Let me run out that door right there.

2235
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:43,200
But that is what creates those heat
shock proteins is that your body realizes

2236
02:11:43,201 --> 02:11:46,290
that it's in this terrible
situation where your way overheated.

2237
02:11:46,590 --> 02:11:50,640
So your body starts creating
these anti-inflammatory
proteins and that's what's

2238
02:11:50,641 --> 02:11:55,110
so good for your body. They did a
study, I think it was in, was it Norway?

2239
02:11:55,290 --> 02:11:55,891
A doctor,

2240
02:11:55,891 --> 02:12:00,660
Rhonda Patrick brought it up on the
podcast that they showed a 40% decrease in

2241
02:12:00,661 --> 02:12:04,560
mortality from all causes,
from use of daily Sauna,

2242
02:12:05,190 --> 02:12:10,020
40% decrease in heart attack, stroke,
cancer, everything across the board.

2243
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:13,200
It's unbelievably good for
you. Do you use the car? Yeah.

2244
02:12:13,201 --> 02:12:17,060
It's because your body
in reaction, the, the,

2245
02:12:17,061 --> 02:12:21,330
the response that your
body has in reaction to the
extreme temperature is just

2246
02:12:21,331 --> 02:12:25,350
to create all these anti inflammatory
properties and that's just so good for

2247
02:12:25,351 --> 02:12:29,430
your body. Inflammation is just the
root of so many different diseases.

2248
02:12:29,431 --> 02:12:30,990
And problems that we have.
Yeah.

2249
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:34,880
So do you, what is like the temperature,
induration duration recommended for that?

2250
02:12:34,990 --> 02:12:39,550
I think it's 170 degrees in,
I think 20 minutes is what they want.

2251
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:44,560
They want 20 minutes at 107 degrees,
170 degrees for um,

2252
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:48,580
for, I believe the test
protocol was four days a week.

2253
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:52,250
Is that the same statistic for
say like a Red Light Sauna?

2254
02:12:52,490 --> 02:12:55,010
It's a good question.
They didn't use a red lights on,

2255
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:58,100
they didn't use an infrared sauna,
so they just use the traditional sauna.

2256
02:12:58,370 --> 02:13:02,780
But the theory is that it doesn't
matter because what matters is your body

2257
02:13:02,781 --> 02:13:06,110
reacting to the temperature change and
that doesn't matter how it's getting to

2258
02:13:06,111 --> 02:13:08,420
you.
They used a regular like hot rock sauna.

2259
02:13:08,450 --> 02:13:11,570
That's what I have regular hot rock sauna.
But I don't think it matters.

2260
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:14,120
I think what really matters
is just extreme temperature.

2261
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:17,140
And there's a lot of people
believe in those infrared saunas.

2262
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:19,880
I think they're better. I don't
know. No, I just know your body,

2263
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:24,800
your body likes sauna. Whenever I do
it, I just feel better sleep all good.

2264
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:27,290
It's just better.
It just feels better for my brain to,

2265
02:13:27,291 --> 02:13:28,520
I just feel better about everything.

2266
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:32,280
I just think it's just like getting your
body heat it up like that and then it

2267
02:13:32,281 --> 02:13:37,020
cools off. It just chills everything out.
You just, everything feels looser. Quiet.

2268
02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:40,290
There's like a quiet afterwards.
Yeah. But yeah, it just,

2269
02:13:40,291 --> 02:13:42,870
everything feels like it works better,
you know?

2270
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,930
And then when I do it on a regular basis,
you know,

2271
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:49,500
but I feel the same way about cryotherapy
when I do cryotherapy on a regular

2272
02:13:49,501 --> 02:13:51,330
basis to everything seems to work better.
Yeah.

2273
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:52,270
See I,

2274
02:13:52,690 --> 02:13:57,690
I only do crowd therapy a couple times
and it hurt my boobs like so much that I,

2275
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:04,450
I'm, I just, I don't want to
go all ice bath and I mean,

2276
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:08,740
the thing is I'll get an ice bath
and I'm really like, I'll get in,

2277
02:14:08,950 --> 02:14:12,160
but I'm complaining the whole
way, you know? Like not,

2278
02:14:12,250 --> 02:14:14,620
not saying one nice thing
to you or your Mama.

2279
02:14:14,621 --> 02:14:18,870
Like I'm getting in there and I'll
do it when I'm ready and oh man,

2280
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:23,860
it's awful. Awful. And those cryotherapy,
things like I appreciate the speed.

2281
02:14:23,861 --> 02:14:25,180
I appreciate like the,

2282
02:14:25,630 --> 02:14:30,280
but like do you really feel that they
get through all of those layers of skin,

2283
02:14:30,281 --> 02:14:32,680
like down to the optimal
level on your tissue?

2284
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:36,710
Well, it's the same thing. It's cold
shock proteins. What happens is,

2285
02:14:36,711 --> 02:14:39,180
I mean if they really got it through
your skin, you'd be dead. Okay.

2286
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:40,760
They're really got through though.

2287
02:14:40,780 --> 02:14:45,470
But the idea is that your body produces
these cold shock proteins in response to

2288
02:14:45,471 --> 02:14:49,880
anything that's over are
under 150 degrees below zero.

2289
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:53,840
That's the sweet spot. Apparently when
you hit that hundred 50 degree below zero,

2290
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:57,380
your body produces all these massive
in anti inflammatory properties.

2291
02:14:57,381 --> 02:15:00,440
Cause again it thinks it's going to die.
So it's like freaking out.

2292
02:15:00,980 --> 02:15:05,980
And people with arthritis and people
with severe autoimmune issues where they

2293
02:15:06,591 --> 02:15:10,700
have a lot of inflammation, real, real
problems with their joints in their hands.

2294
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,490
They have huge results from cryotherapy.

2295
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:16,540
And there's a bunch of people
that go to my place that um,

2296
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:18,860
they say that it's really
essentially change their life.

2297
02:15:19,070 --> 02:15:22,400
They were just in pain all the time and
now they know all they have to do is go

2298
02:15:22,401 --> 02:15:24,620
there,
step in that thing for three minutes,

2299
02:15:24,650 --> 02:15:28,490
leave and they're going to feel better
and they just feel looser and relaxed and

2300
02:15:28,491 --> 02:15:32,150
whatever their flare ups and instead
of their condition deteriorating,

2301
02:15:32,151 --> 02:15:34,190
their condition improved and stabilized.

2302
02:15:34,690 --> 02:15:39,310
Thanks. So it's about your body in the
chemical value, not the cold itself.

2303
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:42,060
Exactly. It's about your
body freaking out. Yeah,

2304
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:44,200
go Yag is what does this bitch doing?

2305
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:47,400
It's 150 degrees below zero oh my God.

2306
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:51,870
And then when you get out of there, you
feel so good. That's what does it for me.

2307
02:15:52,050 --> 02:15:54,900
When I get out all my God,
I feel amazing.

2308
02:15:55,800 --> 02:16:00,800
It's like this rush of, it's just
the, what's it called, norepinephrine.

2309
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:04,310
Yeah, you're, you have this
rush of it in your brain.

2310
02:16:04,311 --> 02:16:07,870
It's like you just took an awesome
drug. He's feel fantastic. I get out,

2311
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:12,250
the sun feels great, people look better.
Everything just feels better. You know,

2312
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:14,030
I do two sessions too.

2313
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:17,870
I do three minutes and then I go out
for 10 minutes and then I go back in for

2314
02:16:17,871 --> 02:16:22,220
another three minutes.
That's how many times a week I try to do,

2315
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:24,110
depending on how many
times I'd do the sauna,

2316
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:27,500
I want to do one or the
other four times a week.

2317
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:30,220
So either I'm doing the
sauna or I'm doing cryo.

2318
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:35,530
So you don't do both in the same day.
Temperature manipulation? Yes, four time,

2319
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:37,210
four days a week.
And if I don't do that,

2320
02:16:37,211 --> 02:16:40,810
I do hot yoga [inaudible] which is
another form of temperature manipulation

2321
02:16:40,811 --> 02:16:44,950
obviously cause you're 104 degrees and
you know, you're there for 90 minutes,

2322
02:16:44,951 --> 02:16:48,970
sweating it out. And that, uh, I
mean it's not as hot in the room,

2323
02:16:48,971 --> 02:16:53,230
but your body absolutely has that same
feeling that it has inside the sauna

2324
02:16:53,231 --> 02:16:57,580
where you're just like claustrophobic.
I gotta get the fuck out of here. Yeah,

2325
02:16:57,770 --> 02:17:02,720
I'm going to try it.
I'll try it. Um, I will,

2326
02:17:02,721 --> 02:17:06,490
I'm gonna send you this Emoji. Like
that's how you'll know I'm there for them.

2327
02:17:06,491 --> 02:17:09,950
One Sauna, I'm good. I sit in there
and I just turned up the jams.

2328
02:17:10,130 --> 02:17:10,970
Well if you look good,

2329
02:17:11,090 --> 02:17:12,620
the song and just stick with a sauna.

2330
02:17:12,650 --> 02:17:15,800
I mean I think that they're
both really good. Yeah.

2331
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:19,310
What if I get in the cold shower
after the sauna is that account?

2332
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:20,140
It was this thing

2333
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:22,510
doing that too.
I like doing that after yoga,

2334
02:17:22,690 --> 02:17:24,880
especially in the winter when
the water gets real cold.

2335
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:28,420
I like to get in that fucking cold
shower and just really large. Yeah. I

2336
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:31,300
feel the two of them and you know,

2337
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:34,330
the UFC has that set up to where they
have the Jacuzzi right next to the cold

2338
02:17:34,331 --> 02:17:38,320
bath that they got that cold plunge.
It's like set to below 50 degrees.

2339
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:41,980
That's right. You hop in there, freeze
your ass off and then hop in the sauna.

2340
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:45,190
Apparently there's like really good
benefits to doing that back and forth like

2341
02:17:45,191 --> 02:17:45,910
that.

2342
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:49,920
Yeah, it was um, the last
fight out there is, uh,

2343
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:54,000
I was sitting in that hot tub and then,
cause I didn't have the sauna, uh,

2344
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:55,790
hooked up.
I just wanted to go in the hot tub and,

2345
02:17:56,050 --> 02:17:59,470
and then I laid on like the partition
and it had like one leg dangling in the

2346
02:17:59,471 --> 02:18:03,070
cold pool and one leg dangling.
And then the water's really good looking,

2347
02:18:03,071 --> 02:18:06,820
I'm sure. But when you're just starving
and dying and give no fucks anymore,

2348
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:10,480
it's just like I'm laying there like that
Mackenzie dern was laying over there.

2349
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:13,840
I look in the little worse than me,
but it's like, I guess, I don't know.

2350
02:18:14,010 --> 02:18:16,430
What did you think?
Would she miss weight by seven pounds?

2351
02:18:16,580 --> 02:18:17,930
Dutch shit's Kinda crazy,
isn't it?

2352
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:22,860
It's crazy because she, like,
I was literally sitting in
the locker room with her,

2353
02:18:22,890 --> 02:18:27,150
like we're giggling at UFC two 22 like,

2354
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:30,060
because we're both like curvy,
right?

2355
02:18:30,061 --> 02:18:33,810
And we're sitting in the locker room
laughing about how much that shit ways,

2356
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:36,540
you know, and it's like, what can you
do about that? And even if you could,

2357
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:39,540
do you really want to like,
I mean, I, I don't hate it,

2358
02:18:40,290 --> 02:18:45,180
but sitting in there and I'm
like laughing about it. And,

2359
02:18:45,181 --> 02:18:47,490
and that was what,
what was the date of that?

2360
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:52,520
March 3rd and then to come down much
over like she got her fight right away,

2361
02:18:54,451 --> 02:18:57,390
announced right away. You know that
she was fighting me. What was it,

2362
02:18:57,391 --> 02:19:00,870
Nate 19th or something
and it was just like that.

2363
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:05,550
Like when you have that data in mind, I
mean granted it's, it's not me, it's her.

2364
02:19:05,551 --> 02:19:08,250
It's, I don't have her body. I don't
have her problems. I don't have her life.

2365
02:19:08,570 --> 02:19:11,760
It's not my not,
it doesn't mean anything to me.

2366
02:19:12,060 --> 02:19:17,040
But to know you have a fight and
it's signed up and it's ready,

2367
02:19:17,041 --> 02:19:20,580
like at that point it's maintenance,
it's maintenance like that.

2368
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:23,670
That's not even doing anything different.
It's just maintenance.

2369
02:19:23,671 --> 02:19:28,280
But like these weight cuts are harder
and harder on us. We get older.

2370
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:31,010
I don't know what her body's
doing. I don't know. Yeah, she's,

2371
02:19:31,011 --> 02:19:35,330
I think she's 25 she's young and I don't,
I don't know. I don't know what that,

2372
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:38,240
to make 115 pounds asks of her and,

2373
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,190
and I don't know if she's
on her period or not.

2374
02:19:40,191 --> 02:19:43,580
I don't know if that makes a
difference to her. With me. I always,

2375
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:46,880
I always get mine the
day of wins I have other,

2376
02:19:46,881 --> 02:19:51,020
I have like three other girls for other
girls that I know that it's the exact

2377
02:19:51,021 --> 02:19:51,561
same thing.

2378
02:19:51,561 --> 02:19:55,400
Like the morning of made way about to
go downstairs and there's that fucker

2379
02:19:55,401 --> 02:19:56,234
looking at you right then

2380
02:19:58,180 --> 02:20:01,590
just like there's why I couldn't lose it
last two pounds. Sweet. I would like to

2381
02:20:01,890 --> 02:20:06,330
the John Crouch about what happened
cause uh, he asked her to leave the lab.

2382
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:10,770
Oh that was where she was at when
you asked, did she ever say why?

2383
02:20:11,250 --> 02:20:13,380
She didn't say why.
He didn't say why either.

2384
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:18,830
They're both playing it professional.
I don't know what happened, but she was

2385
02:20:19,050 --> 02:20:20,810
long time too though,
wasn't she? Well like,

2386
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:23,960
cause when I went to go train
down there, she, she was already,

2387
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:25,100
she was there one in the days.

2388
02:20:25,210 --> 02:20:29,560
Yeah. I don't know. I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. But I know her dad.

2389
02:20:29,710 --> 02:20:34,060
He's doesn't he teach in Arizona?
Magnetite I think so. Yeah.

2390
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:37,270
I'm hurt. Jiu Jitsu is fucking
nasty though, isn't it?

2391
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:42,150
So gnarly. Woo. Yeah, she's good. We
competed against each other. Yeah. Yeah.

2392
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:45,690
I was beating her ass. Well,
yeah. Well it was rough.

2393
02:20:46,470 --> 02:20:50,490
It was rough because I, I, it was
worlds, we were both purple belts.

2394
02:20:50,491 --> 02:20:52,200
I think it was the open division.
So I was like,

2395
02:20:52,470 --> 02:20:56,210
I was heavier than her by the
next weight class. And, um,

2396
02:20:57,110 --> 02:20:59,130
I,
I went to take her down.

2397
02:20:59,190 --> 02:21:02,520
I double leg are all big and
then like where we landed.

2398
02:21:02,521 --> 02:21:05,880
So if this is like the square,
we landed like right here.

2399
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:10,660
And so they called it out and so they
reset us in the middle. So no points. Oh,

2400
02:21:10,820 --> 02:21:14,940
so we get in the middle because she's
Mckenzie because I'm not resilient enough.

2401
02:21:15,330 --> 02:21:20,310
Maybe. So I would, they start
us again. I'm like, okay, no,

2402
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:22,590
did, I can't, don't go
near that line. Right.

2403
02:21:22,591 --> 02:21:27,300
So I go and I shoot another double picker
up, go take her down again. Same thing,

2404
02:21:27,301 --> 02:21:28,134
but like,

2405
02:21:28,890 --> 02:21:32,340
it's out of bounds again because it was
too close because my double is like a

2406
02:21:32,341 --> 02:21:34,560
tackle, you know? Right. And then, um,

2407
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:38,940
so we go back in the middle
and we shake hands and we go.

2408
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:42,630
So this time I go, shoot, I
pick her up and I look at the
ref like, like here, good.

2409
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:47,550
Is this good? Okay. Put her
down here. Yeah. So put it
down, go to pass her guard.

2410
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,200
And I passed. And then,
um, I think she had,

2411
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:55,620
I sat back for a straight
ankle lock and they're like,

2412
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:59,990
and they disqualified me. What? And
they're like, you can't have an ankle.

2413
02:21:59,991 --> 02:22:02,430
And they're like, you can't do that. I
was, I can't do what? And they're like,

2414
02:22:02,431 --> 02:22:04,620
you can't do that. And it's in
the rule books. I'm like, okay,

2415
02:22:04,621 --> 02:22:06,780
if I'm going to look in the real
rule books, what am I looking up?

2416
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:11,310
What can't I do? Thank you. Can't,
you can't do that. You need to go,

2417
02:22:11,311 --> 02:22:13,830
you're disqualified. I'm
like, tell me what I did.

2418
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:18,990
And they said that I reaped the knee,
but I like, I didn't like, I don't,

2419
02:22:19,050 --> 02:22:20,610
I really don't think I did.
You know?

2420
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:24,880
So you think they were just juke in
the system to try to get her to win?

2421
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:29,500
She's Brazilian. I don't
know. I don't know. It does.

2422
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:31,410
And it's happened to some tournaments.

2423
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:34,840
Yeah. And I mean they, they,
they sent, the thing is, is like,

2424
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:39,220
I love Ibj JF tournaments and I want to
compete in them for the rest of my life.

2425
02:22:39,221 --> 02:22:42,580
Like I, you know, so,
but, but yeah, there is,

2426
02:22:42,581 --> 02:22:44,440
there is some themes that go on there.

2427
02:22:44,441 --> 02:22:49,000
Like there's definitely birthrights that
gets you places that like that I would

2428
02:22:49,001 --> 02:22:51,910
really like to have, but at the
same time, I don't really know.

2429
02:22:51,940 --> 02:22:53,170
I don't want to have been born into,

2430
02:22:53,171 --> 02:22:56,230
I want it to make the statement of like
happier birthright. Like, I got this,

2431
02:22:56,231 --> 02:23:00,670
you know, I made it to some pretty
bad ass tournaments in, in, you know,

2432
02:23:00,671 --> 02:23:04,990
just like fighting the way I fight and
trying not to give a shit about all of

2433
02:23:04,991 --> 02:23:09,430
that. And like I continued to do that.
I want to do the same, you know. Um,

2434
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:12,940
but that was,
that was a rough one for me.

2435
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,410
Like I was excited about that tournament.

2436
02:23:14,411 --> 02:23:18,040
I trained hard for that tournament
and I think we were each other's like,

2437
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:22,600
I don't remember what match
into the tournament. It was
what to be disqualified.

2438
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:24,450
And I was like,
but I still,

2439
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:28,480
Carl specifically reaping the need.
Don't you have to go against the joint?

2440
02:23:28,970 --> 02:23:33,190
I don't know. I don't know. Like,
I wish I could draw you a picture,

2441
02:23:33,470 --> 02:23:38,060
show you a finger, Bang. Come up
with an excuse. We'll be, I mean,

2442
02:23:38,090 --> 02:23:42,710
the first two takedowns like we
weren't, okay. Maybe your first one,

2443
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:46,160
maybe the first one. We were on
the line out fine. The second one,

2444
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:50,600
like we hit the ground and then we
get it a little. So, but we were in,

2445
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:54,260
you know, and then the third one, I'm
being a Dick, you know? And I'm just like,

2446
02:23:54,290 --> 02:23:56,300
yeah, yeah, here good. You
know? And so they like,

2447
02:23:56,750 --> 02:24:00,110
they gave me the points and then I pass
and they give me the points and then I

2448
02:24:00,111 --> 02:24:04,940
sit back for that and now I'm disqualified
and it looks like swallow.

2449
02:24:05,300 --> 02:24:08,870
It is. And I like her, you know
what I mean? Like I like her.

2450
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:13,010
Her Dad was at my gym teaching
a seminar at my gym in Colorado,

2451
02:24:13,250 --> 02:24:14,360
like months earlier.

2452
02:24:14,361 --> 02:24:17,930
And so when the match is over and we go
and we're like standing next to them,

2453
02:24:17,931 --> 02:24:19,700
they're like,
sorry.

2454
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:25,470
Did you see the video that somebody made
on Instagram of her after one day in

2455
02:24:25,471 --> 02:24:29,940
Liverpool? No. Do you know
people make fun of her accent?

2456
02:24:29,980 --> 02:24:31,540
That it's not real?
Oh,

2457
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:35,280
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu one just told me
that recently that she apparently,

2458
02:24:35,730 --> 02:24:39,330
I don't know. I mean people
accents or weird to begin with.

2459
02:24:39,331 --> 02:24:41,460
Like why do people talk the way
they talk in the first place?

2460
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:45,210
Because the sound with the people around
them. Geographical. Yeah. I mean it's,

2461
02:24:45,211 --> 02:24:48,060
it's weird, but there's a video that
somebody made of Mckinsey during,

2462
02:24:48,061 --> 02:24:51,000
after one day in Liverpool and
this basically her talking,

2463
02:24:51,001 --> 02:24:53,410
but Darren tills voice instead.

2464
02:24:55,990 --> 02:24:59,180
It's a rough, it's rough. I'm not
playing that. Don't play a JV.

2465
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:02,880
Don't even pull it up.
I will not do that to her.

2466
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:09,270
But it's pretty funny. Yeah, because I
was super confused when I interviewed her.

2467
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:12,030
Um,
when she won in the UFC,

2468
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:17,830
they wanted a translator and I was like,
what are you talking about?

2469
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:21,550
Like she speaks perfect English.
Like this is really bizarre.

2470
02:25:21,551 --> 02:25:25,090
So George Greer Gel came
in, me and uh, he's like,

2471
02:25:25,091 --> 02:25:27,760
just in case she gets messed up anymore,
it's in like, I didn't even question it.

2472
02:25:27,761 --> 02:25:30,370
I was like, okay. I was confused.
I'm like, but wait a minute.

2473
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:33,820
I know she speaks perfect English.
Like this is ridiculous.

2474
02:25:34,030 --> 02:25:37,480
Raised in Arizona right now,
but she fucking speaks perfect English.

2475
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:41,260
So I don't know if they were selling it,
you know?

2476
02:25:41,261 --> 02:25:45,700
I don't know whose idea it was. I don't
know. I don't know. I don't get it.

2477
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:47,860
But the fucking Internet. Got It. Okay.

2478
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:53,510
Maybe they went, they went
crazy. Everybody was like,

2479
02:25:53,630 --> 02:25:56,600
what in the fuck is happening? I
didn't question it. I'm like, look,

2480
02:25:56,601 --> 02:25:58,590
I'm just here to interview her.
I just want her to, I mean,

2481
02:25:58,610 --> 02:26:01,790
she wants to speak in Portuguese, wants
speak in English. I don't give a fuck.

2482
02:26:01,791 --> 02:26:06,760
But I was like, why do you
need a translator? Like,
that's, that's insane. Damn.

2483
02:26:07,490 --> 02:26:10,520
I don't know all of that. I don't
know all that either. You know?

2484
02:26:10,550 --> 02:26:12,830
She definitely speaks
English really well though.

2485
02:26:13,070 --> 02:26:17,450
Does it? Is there a benefit to
not Brazilian? Well, yeah. I mean,

2486
02:26:17,630 --> 02:26:21,140
obviously that's a huge demographic
in this sport. Huge, Ooh,

2487
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:25,880
primarily the biggest other
than an American American.

2488
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:29,960
But I'm curious if there's
like a benefit or a marketing,

2489
02:26:29,990 --> 02:26:33,110
like is there there's or something
to that that would make that more,

2490
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:37,930
well, Brazilians have immense
national pride, you know,

2491
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:43,020
and her being a Brazilian and the daughter
of a Brazilian Jujitsu legend and you

2492
02:26:43,751 --> 02:26:46,690
know, and speaking perfect
Portuguese and English and, and just,

2493
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:49,420
I guess maybe that's the idea behind it.
I don't know.

2494
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:50,910
She's killing it though.

2495
02:26:50,911 --> 02:26:55,911
Like technically and with her style and
I mean like everything that she brings

2496
02:26:56,281 --> 02:27:00,840
to the table is, is already good. You
know? It's like don't fuck that up.

2497
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:05,220
Don't fuck with it. Some. Yeah. Who knows
what your dad again. Yeah. I don't know.

2498
02:27:05,221 --> 02:27:06,990
You know what?
Sometimes when I get around people,

2499
02:27:06,991 --> 02:27:10,260
like I feel bad because like I try
to be like really empathetic and,

2500
02:27:10,261 --> 02:27:15,261
and when I'm around like foreigners
and like I will totally slow down my

2501
02:27:15,931 --> 02:27:16,680
speaking,

2502
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:20,370
so they will get it to the point where
sometimes I think I look condescending.

2503
02:27:20,510 --> 02:27:23,700
Right. You know where I'm like,
I just want this conversation.

2504
02:27:23,701 --> 02:27:28,230
Who is easy as possible for you because
I'm already awkward and like let me help

2505
02:27:28,231 --> 02:27:30,420
you out. You know? That's a
different thing. But it's like,

2506
02:27:30,421 --> 02:27:33,300
you remember when Madonna had a fake
English accent and everybody was like,

2507
02:27:33,301 --> 02:27:35,700
pitch, you're from Brooklyn or
wherever the fuck you're from,

2508
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:39,960
not from England and you can't
do that stuff. Yeah. I mean,

2509
02:27:39,961 --> 02:27:43,410
depending on who she's around, I guess.
I don't know. Fuck. That's the thing,

2510
02:27:43,411 --> 02:27:47,940
like if you're around people that have
that accent, you'll, you will pick it up.

2511
02:27:47,970 --> 02:27:48,730
Yeah.

2512
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:50,830
When I was a kid,
I definitely had a Boston accent,

2513
02:27:50,831 --> 02:27:55,700
but I heard myself talk on TV once
when I was like 19 it was a Boston bag.

2514
02:27:56,810 --> 02:27:58,790
No,
I've got to get rid of that.

2515
02:27:58,820 --> 02:28:02,990
Like how did I pick that up so quick
and my family's all Minnesota rural,

2516
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:03,411
you know?

2517
02:28:03,411 --> 02:28:06,380
And so when I go home I get that and it
will stick around for a few weeks. Sure.

2518
02:28:06,470 --> 02:28:10,600
Especially if you drink, right?
Yeah, for sure. I'm real tired. Yeah.

2519
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:14,840
Or You have your round. All those people,
it's like comforting. Accents are funny.

2520
02:28:15,030 --> 02:28:16,470
It's strange.
You know they're,

2521
02:28:16,471 --> 02:28:19,590
they really are strange that
the like specific to regions,

2522
02:28:19,990 --> 02:28:22,190
it just shows you how people are,

2523
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:26,180
you know, southern accents and even
like England like you have like,

2524
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:29,510
like very,
very different like British accents,

2525
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:32,240
which I'm sure to them
sounds exactly like,

2526
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:36,170
you know Texas versus versus need work.
You know,

2527
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:38,040
just the different twain.
Yeah.

2528
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:42,500
My friend's wife is from Liverpool and
she was trying to explain scouse to me

2529
02:28:42,501 --> 02:28:46,070
like the way they talk and
Liverpool versus the way
they would talk and like say

2530
02:28:46,071 --> 02:28:50,300
London and let y'all sounded English
to me. You might as well be Australia.

2531
02:28:50,301 --> 02:28:54,980
And I was like, I don't get it. I get
that. You sound different than me.

2532
02:28:56,090 --> 02:28:57,470
I don't get what's happening though.

2533
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:01,100
I don't get the accent until
like somebody like, like,

2534
02:29:01,310 --> 02:29:05,870
like Darren tills clearly has
like that Liverpool accent.

2535
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:10,610
It's so clear. But I don't, I still don't
get it. I don't know what it is. You know,

2536
02:29:11,380 --> 02:29:15,740
you can say he's from London.
I'm like, oh, okay cool.
English, English isn't there?

2537
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:20,800
Is it like that or like whoever was a
rain there had like a list and so then

2538
02:29:22,070 --> 02:29:25,160
it'd be set and then that ended up
being the people picked up as like,

2539
02:29:25,161 --> 02:29:27,220
was it a compliment or
just how it happened?

2540
02:29:27,221 --> 02:29:30,680
Cause that's how things were like
pronounced when they were being explained.

2541
02:29:30,681 --> 02:29:31,610
Like,
I don't know,

2542
02:29:31,611 --> 02:29:35,300
maybe there's some kind of like speech
impediment that went along with every

2543
02:29:35,330 --> 02:29:39,170
different dialect.
And I mean that is what it is with Spain,

2544
02:29:39,210 --> 02:29:43,910
the way they pronounce certain words is
because like some fucking king somewhere

2545
02:29:43,911 --> 02:29:47,960
along the line had a list.
Strange, strange shit.

2546
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:52,030
Did you know that a place in Brazil
that has a list also? I forget. Really?

2547
02:29:53,260 --> 02:29:56,150
Oh I'm not, I'm sure there must be
like different axes. Brazil, right.

2548
02:29:56,151 --> 02:30:00,950
Brazil is fucking huge. I mean definitely
different singsong type tones. Tones.

2549
02:30:00,951 --> 02:30:04,790
I would say more. Yeah. Did you
ever, uh, train down there? Yeah,

2550
02:30:04,791 --> 02:30:08,150
I've been down there I think three times,

2551
02:30:08,151 --> 02:30:12,020
four times to train to chain
in the visit. I did. Uh, uh,

2552
02:30:12,021 --> 02:30:15,880
I wanted big old Jujitsu
tournament down there before. Yeah.

2553
02:30:15,890 --> 02:30:19,610
I think it was like Brazilian
nationals, something like that. So we,

2554
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:22,280
I would go down like get
fully ready to train,

2555
02:30:22,310 --> 02:30:27,110
get there the day before and cut because
once you're there and then compete the

2556
02:30:27,111 --> 02:30:28,010
second day I was there.

2557
02:30:28,011 --> 02:30:31,070
So the rest of it's vacation cause it's
like once you're there, all the food,

2558
02:30:31,071 --> 02:30:33,440
all of the like beach and like lazy,

2559
02:30:33,441 --> 02:30:36,170
like there's nothing in me that
wants to work hard as I could do.

2560
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:40,980
All I want to do is just enjoy the music
and the sounds and the people and I

2561
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,350
know how to cook down there. Those two.
Haas Korea's holy shit is brilliant.

2562
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:49,550
Brilliant. Well you guys have them in
San Diego. They have them everywhere now.

2563
02:30:49,551 --> 02:30:53,630
Thank God.
But a style of cooking is the best.

2564
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:57,660
Those skewers oversight over fire. That's
what I'm talking about. Meat over fire.

2565
02:30:58,050 --> 02:31:01,370
That's it. That's it. And then the
little sauces, like the creations,

2566
02:31:01,371 --> 02:31:06,080
just oil and lime and, and seasonings.
So good. Talking to more, you won't make,

2567
02:31:06,081 --> 02:31:08,720
wait. Oh my God. I'll always make, wait,

2568
02:31:08,721 --> 02:31:10,430
I'm just a little bit
more dead than others.

2569
02:31:12,060 --> 02:31:13,790
Why is cap cut off her leg?

2570
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:18,460
We just did two and a half hours
time just flew by. Right. So,

2571
02:31:18,461 --> 02:31:20,190
um,
good luck.

2572
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:23,580
Good luck in, um, in Boise. I'm
looking forward to seeing you fight.

2573
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:28,170
I'm very excited and I'm glad
we finally got a chance to
do this. And, uh, it's, uh,

2574
02:31:28,230 --> 02:31:32,400
is it causing Gunno MMA on Twitter?
What is your,

2575
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:33,833
do you know it?

2576
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:37,490
She's got to check her phone.
I know how to send stuff out,

2577
02:31:37,491 --> 02:31:40,070
but I don't know what it is.
Uh,

2578
02:31:40,071 --> 02:31:43,850
it is Alpha Katz and Co at Cat Zingano.

2579
02:31:44,210 --> 02:31:47,330
And then on my Instagram, it's Alpha
Cat Zingano. And then Facebook.

2580
02:31:47,331 --> 02:31:49,130
It's cat Zingano,
MMA fighter.

2581
02:31:49,240 --> 02:31:52,670
Cason Ghana. Ladies and
gentlemen. Thank you. I'm glad
we finally did this. Alright,

2582
02:31:53,050 --> 02:31:54,910
thank you. My pleasure. Bye everybody.

2583
02:32:01,490 --> 02:32:01,590
Hm?
