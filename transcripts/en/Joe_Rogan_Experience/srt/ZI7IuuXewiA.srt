1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,521
Well,

2
00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:00,941
like I said,

3
00:00:00,941 --> 00:00:01,631
we're going to try something.

4
00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:02,350
Um,

5
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,110
this is actually something I wrote in
Nashville with a couple of guys that I

6
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:08,740
don't know if it's ever going to come to
fruition or anything or I'm not sure if

7
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:09,060
it's going to,

8
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,540
if it will ever be on one of my records.

9
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,890
But I figured let's try
something like that.

10
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,450
Do something new.

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,880
I don't even know what this caught.

12
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,990
I think this is called a,

13
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,633
it ain't easy

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,550
with the Superman

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,880
Scott off from the stitches.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,280
No,

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,981
my hands.

18
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:54,814
But Sam

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,500
shanking other hand

20
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,480
when no kind.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,950
Some town.

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,220
Hey Z.

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,293
Oh

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,783
hey.

25
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,903
Z

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,373
China

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,433
stock.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,940
Hey Z.

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,153
Aha.

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:36,931
Wow.

31
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,150
This picture frame.

32
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,750
Okay.

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,190
Yeah.

34
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,790
This shit a photo graph

35
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,910
made me laugh

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,230
at him.

37
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,070
Now I'll go home.

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,913
Fine.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,540
Hey Z,

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,090
some town waiting as the hottest spot

41
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,780
you.

42
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,090
Oh,

43
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,240
we'll keep following

44
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,560
challenge from their stock.

45
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,320
Cytel away.

46
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,740
My new little more work on that one.

47
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,370
But please stop judging
yourself that she was beautiful.

48
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,660
Everybody jump around from town to town

49
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,950
slash gown

50
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,270
rats they snatch out.
