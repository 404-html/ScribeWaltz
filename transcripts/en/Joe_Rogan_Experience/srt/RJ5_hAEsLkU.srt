1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,830
The infamous Jamie double finger gun and
we're live.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:06,790
How are you sir?
Good.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,130
Seeing that it's coming back.
Looking healthy.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,430
Looking fresh.
When I stopped eating meat since I last 

5
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,670
saw I heard about that.
I want to talk to you about that.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,040
And uh,
I don't know that

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,810
correlating with health.
I,

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,930
every time I worry about this out loud,
I get hate mail from vegans and 

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,090
vegetarians.
You say stop,

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,290
you start putting your bullshit on us.
Well you,

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,390
they,
they don't like when you associate any 

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,041
negative consequences whatsoever with 
only in vegetables because it's because 

13
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,330
it's essentially a cult.
It's a wonderful cult of people that 

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,180
want to take care of animals,
be nice to animals,

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,000
but they're very tribal,
very tribal,

16
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:49,001
very cult like.
And if you say anything that's negative 

17
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:49,001
against Vegans,
they gang up.

18
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:52,520
I go to forums and I read the things 
they say they organize like little troll

19
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:56,210
attacks and they make youtube videos.
It's kind of hilarious,

20
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:57,890
like from a psychological standpoint.

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,830
Yeah.
I mean,

22
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:03,831
you know,
obviously I don't want it to become a 

23
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:03,831
new religion or my,
my one religion,

24
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:08,601
but there is a moral high ground to the 
position that I find very attractive 

25
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,690
because I felt like a hypocrite as a 
mediator now.

26
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:17,691
Um,
and I don't think there's necessarily 

27
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:17,691
extends to someone like you who hunts 
and feels okay about hunting.

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,260
Um,
and I don't have an argument against 

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,940
hunting the way I do against factory 
farming or,

30
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,390
or more,
more or less any of the way we get meat.

31
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,980
Um,
you know,

32
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,290
the,
the environmental implications of it,

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,770
but it's um,
so it is very captivating as a position 

34
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,030
and you feel like an ass and when,
once you,

35
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:44,031
once you go far enough into the inquiry,
you feel like an asshole not being 

36
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:48,951
sensitive to these concerns and just,
I'm ignoring how you're getting your 

37
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:50,460
food three times a day.
But,

38
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,110
um,
I'm not yet for me.

39
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:58,111
I maybe,
I'm sure there's individual variation 

40
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,171
and I'm not the smartest vegetarian in 
the world in terms of how I prepare my 

41
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:03,630
food and how attentive I am to it.
So the onus is somewhat on me,

42
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,310
but I,
I'm,

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,990
uh,
I'm not totally sure it's uh,

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,450
the healthiest thing for me so I,
you know,

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,890
so you say this started,
you said you look healthy.

46
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,910
Mbi,
I feel like my health is somewhat with 

47
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:18,910
reign under this has been about nine 
months.

48
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,850
Weathering,
um,

49
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,990
are you getting your blood checked?
Are You doing year 12 supplementation?

50
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,430
Yeah,
that's essential oils.

51
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,370
Essential [inaudible] is essential as 
well.

52
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:30,410
Most people are just not going to get 
enough from the sun.

53
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,490
And are you monitoring your intake of 
fatty acids and things along those 

54
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,710
lines?
Not really beyond the supplementation.

55
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:40,550
I'm,
I'm just,

56
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,140
uh,
trying to get the food in.

57
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah.
Well it's good.

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,440
It's all good stuff,
but it's really important,

59
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:49,310
like one of the things that people rage 
against,

60
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,000
unfortunately,
it's the stigma and it's fats,

61
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,390
it's dietary cholesterol,
dietary cholesterol and saturated fats 

62
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,070
which are critical for hormone.
And it's one

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,350
of the reasons why people when they get 
an all vegetable diet,

64
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,120
if you're not really careful with 
coconut oil,

65
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:07,350
you got to eat a lot of coconut oil.
I'm a big fan of Avocados.

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,700
I eat a lot of Avocados,
a lot of avocado oil,

67
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,550
coconut oil as well though.
Almond butter,

68
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,550
nuts,
things on those lines like you,

69
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,510
you really need to get those essential 
fats.

70
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,060
Well actually I'm not Vegan so I would 
like to be Vegan,

71
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,290
but.
But I'm still eating dairy.

72
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,260
And did you say you would like to be?
No one's holding you.

73
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,630
No one's holding you down to Goddammit 
Sam,

74
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,470
you need to have some milk?
No,

75
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,270
no.
I think just.

76
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,330
I think I would screw it up again.
I'm going to reap the whirlwind when 

77
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,830
from the Vegans,
but I should've brought you some eggs,

78
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,970
but I eat eggs.
I eat eggs and a,

79
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,050
but as you know,
you can only eat so many eggs and,

80
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,900
and so much dairy,
but I eat a lot of eggs.

81
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,890
The eggs are very good for you too.
Here's the,

82
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,220
there's another thing,
dietary cholesterol,

83
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,950
like people are always concerned with 
dietary cholesterol.

84
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:55,951
Well,
that was a big myth for the longest 

85
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:55,951
time.
As a matter of fact,

86
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:57,970
dietary cholesterol barely moves the 
needle and blood lipids,

87
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,280
a lot of them people have cholesterol 
issues.

88
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,610
It's sedentary lifestyle.
There's genetics,

89
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,510
there's all sorts of other variables,
but people with healthy lifestyles,

90
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,780
it doesn't seem to be that dietary 
cholesterol is bad for you.

91
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,040
And also it's essential for testosterone
production.

92
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

93
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,080
So I get a ton of,
or not a ton,

94
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:23,890
but I'm not trying to avoid saturated 
fat.

95
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,040
So I,
um,

96
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,860
I get a fair amount of.
You have a yard?

97
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,810
Uh,
yeah.

98
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,860
Could you raise some chickens?
No,

99
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,720
no,
not after this.

100
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:39,721
I'll take you to my house.
So I'll show you the chicken setup we 

101
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:39,721
have.
We just got five new ones.

102
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,370
We have an 18 now.
One of them died.

103
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,860
They just fucking die sometimes.
You don't know why.

104
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,120
Just go in the chicken coop.
One's dead father time got in there with

105
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,160
his side and they're getting kind of old
now.

106
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:56,161
Some of them,
I don't know how old the chicken lasts 

107
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:56,161
honestly,
but they're like pets.

108
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,970
They give you food,
like there's no negativity.

109
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,770
I opened the door,
they come up to me,

110
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:02,350
the run around.
I feed feel like there's no,

111
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,360
they're not trapped.
As a matter of fact,

112
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:09,361
they go into their pen at night,
like you leave it open and they wander 

113
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,180
around my.
I have a big yard.

114
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:15,181
They wander in my yard,
they eat a bunch of bugs and stuff and 

115
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:15,181
then they go back inside when they want 
to.

116
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,550
So there's no like animal captivities,
no cruelty.

117
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,970
There's nothing weird going on.
And so those eggs,

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,040
they're pretty much Karma free.

119
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,180
Oh yeah,
yeah.

120
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,350
No,
I don't doubt that.

121
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:31,351
It's just when you read the details of 
how our dairy and I mean it's near 

122
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,340
arguably as bad if not worse than much 
of the meat production.

123
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,530
So you know,
moving from eating,

124
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,070
eating me to being a vegetarian in some 
ways is a symbolic move ethically if 

125
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,220
you,
if you really wanted to,

126
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,750
to not participate in the machinery,
but there's an issue with me that's for 

127
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,530
vegetarianism.
There is an issue with the how they 

128
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:55,890
gather food.
I mean there's,

129
00:05:55,891 --> 00:06:00,891
there's a giant issue that people don't 
want to take into consideration is like 

130
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:02,780
how are they growing all this food?
How they growing all these plants.

131
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:07,781
Well,
one of the things they're doing is 

132
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:08,480
they're displacing wildlife that chewing
up this ground in these combines,

133
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,110
if you eat grain and particular combines
indiscriminately,

134
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,450
just chew up all that stuff and they get
deer,

135
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,710
Fonz,
mice,

136
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:16,820
rabbits,
rats,

137
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,820
rodents,
untold amount of bugs if you want to get

138
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:23,810
really deep.
I mean there's no like being a Vegan and

139
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:28,811
being a vegetarian is most certainly 
less cruel and less harmful overall,

140
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,390
but it's not Karma free.
It can't,

141
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,900
unless you're growing your own stuff.
If you can grow all your own vegetables 

142
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,990
and you essentially live on a small 
farm,

143
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,460
yeah,
you could.

144
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,150
You could do it and really feel good,
but it's.

145
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,990
If you're buying it in the store,
you're participating in factory farming.

146
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,991
Whether you like it or not,
you're just participating it vegetable 

147
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:52,991
farming,
but it's.

148
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,530
There's still issues.

149
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,560
Oh yeah,
yeah,

150
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,520
yeah.
Just,

151
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,260
just viewer.
I had this guy on my podcast boom.

152
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,090
Have a lady who's running this company 
called Memphis meats,

153
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,360
which is cultured meat is a startup in 
silicon.

154
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:06,990
Oh,
okay.

155
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,120
Um,
and then try that.

156
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,020
I haven't tried it.
No,

157
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,120
I want to try it,
but it was a fascinating conversation 

158
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,120
because he basically,
what's,

159
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,540
what's fascinating to me on two levels 
is one is just,

160
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:23,541
it's fascinating that we're on the cusp 
of being able to produce actual 

161
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,870
biologically identical meat.
That is,

162
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,650
that is totally cruelty.
I mean,

163
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,530
it's,
it's,

164
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,870
there's no,
there's no implication of cruelty at all

165
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:31,260
in it.
Right.

166
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,070
And you would just grow,
grow this in a Vat,

167
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:39,930
the way you brew beer essentially.
And uh,

168
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,130
so that's,
you know,

169
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:46,131
that seems like the future.
But what's interesting psychologically 

170
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,180
is that people have this,
this creepy feeling around it,

171
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:51,040
which is very strange because it,
so you,

172
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,780
I'm telling you,
I can take the misery and death out of 

173
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:56,780
the process,
right?

174
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,990
I can take the suffering animal out of 
it.

175
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:00,510
I can take the chaos of the 
slaughterhouse out of it.

176
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,800
There's no,
you know,

177
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,650
a cow that has been mistreated for its 
whole life,

178
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,130
stumbling in blood and feces on the way 
to the,

179
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,600
you know,
the killing floor.

180
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Um,
and somehow removing all of that makes 

181
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,200
it creepy or people,
right?

182
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,110
They want,
they want,

183
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:16,970
they want that.
I mean,

184
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,730
that's the natural way to get me,
and if I told you this is grown in a vat

185
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:25,731
by a guy in a white lab coat and has no 
xeno viruses and no bacteria,

186
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,850
nothing,
you know,

187
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:31,851
antibiotics were used to pump this thing
up and it's just the cells you want 

188
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,590
people start to just kind of an eerie 
feeling that,

189
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,350
that,
that I think we're going to get over.

190
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,320
But it's interesting psychologically 
that it's there in the first place.

191
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,150
Did you get that feeling or you just 
know the people know?

192
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,840
I hope they understand it.
I mean,

193
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,070
I'm,
I'm past it,

194
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,170
but I understand it.
Who Do you know that got it,

195
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,330
that just,
I just see the reaction that,

196
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,460
you know,
when I actually pulled this on twitter,

197
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm at 20 percent of pay,
like 15,000

198
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,130
people answered the poll.
So it was like,

199
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,160
it was a,
it's not a scientifically valid poll of 

200
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,540
the general population.
It's just whoever got it on my,

201
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,620
on my feet.
But um,

202
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,210
it was interesting to see.
I,

203
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,340
I,
I asked,

204
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,220
you know,
of the people who wouldn't switch,

205
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,280
I asked would you switch?
And something like 80 percent said they 

206
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,970
would switch if this was affordable and 
available and safe.

207
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,760
Um,
but of the people who wouldn't switch,

208
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,940
it was 25 percent wouldn't switch 
because it's just creepy and 25 percent 

209
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,270
assume that it was um,
a not healthy.

210
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,430
I think I forgot the,
the for the breakdown.

211
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,590
Um,
another 25 percent was we're already 

212
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,590
vegan or vegetarian and didn't want to 
eat meat,

213
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,580
but there was an ick factor for at least
25 percent of the people who wouldn't do

214
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,810
it.
I understand it.

215
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,960
I wonder how many people would go back 
to eating meat if they could raise it 

216
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:53,541
this way.
Like how many people who had gone vegan 

217
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,641
would go back to eating this 
scientifically created lab created beef?

218
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,540
I think enough for a series market.
Yeah,

219
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,750
for sure.
Well,

220
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,820
there'd be a serious market for it for 
sure.

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If they could get the cost effective.
Because last time I saw it was like 

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
quarter million bucks for a 
cheeseburger.

223
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,980
I think it's down.
I think it's $18,000

224
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:13,910
from me for.
I mean,

225
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,750
it'll eventually be like,
you know,

226
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,570
the Apollo computers now fit in your 
pocket much stronger in fact,

227
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:20,700
than the Apollo computers.

228
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,900
Well,
the sequencing,

229
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,540
the genome,
this,

230
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,090
this I just noticed,
which is fascinating.

231
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,990
Um,
sequencing the genome 15 years ago,

232
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,930
cost $3,000,000,000.
It's now 3000,

233
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,660
so it's a million fold reduction in cost
in 15 years.

234
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,130
That's insane.
So something like that,

235
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,240
things tend to scale that way.
So yeah,

236
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,030
that's a giant scale though when you 
talk about human history,

237
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,470
that's awesome.
Good Lord.

238
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:51,471
Imagine if you're a guy who spent 3 
billion of it 15 years ago and you're 

239
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:51,471
like,
God,

240
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:54,060
if I just fucking wait here would to 
saved so much money.

241
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,790
And that's mean.
We don't anticipate that.

242
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,990
When we think of how difficult it is to 
solve certain problems,

243
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,991
we don't.
And this is ray Kurzweil's point of 

244
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:06,690
records while who I think is,
is a bit of a cult leader.

245
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:10,770
And um,
I'm a carnival barker on many topics.

246
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,820
This,
this point,

247
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,770
he makes it again and again I think is 
quite valid,

248
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:18,771
which is when you're factoring how 
difficult it will be to get into the end

249
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:23,871
zone,
whatever that ends on is you're not 

250
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:26,241
tending to factor all of the 
improvements and the compounding 

251
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:26,241
improvements in technology along the 
way.

252
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,080
So I would love to get back to Ray 
Kurzweil,

253
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,290
but I wanted to bring up this point 
about did you.

254
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:35,330
One of the things about going Vegan,
especially when you proclaim and you go 

255
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,060
public with going Vegan,
if you back out of that,

256
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,800
that's where,
that's where I am as a vegetarian.

257
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,460
They get fucking mad.
They get mad.

258
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Did you see that family?
A couple that runs a bunch of Vegan 

259
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,440
restaurants.
Um,

260
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,410
and they decided to start eating meat 
again.

261
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,950
Even though they,
a Vegan restaurants,

262
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,080
they decided to start.
They have their own farm,

263
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,630
they raise their own cattle and they 
started eating their own cattle.

264
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,520
It was real weird too because they 
brought,

265
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,680
there was a lot of Jesus in their 
message,

266
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,880
right?
There was a lot of,

267
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:08,881
like Jesus said,
we're supposed to take care of the 

268
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:08,881
biblical quotes.
You know,

269
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:10,960
like really obscure biblical quotes 
about food,

270
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,680
like,
oh,

271
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:13,870
okay,
like what are you doing here?

272
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,150
But they have a.
Here it is.

273
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,630
Vegans were bold against owners of 
famous La Vegan restaurants after meat 

274
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,760
eating outed.
Well,

275
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,800
I think,
I don't think you could say the outage 

276
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,210
because I'm pretty sure they put it on 
their facebook page.

277
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,940
Like the guy was like first cheeseburger
and 15 years.

278
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,430
Is this,
this is cafe gratitude.

279
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,030
Yes.

280
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,580
Oh yeah.
So,

281
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,090
well the other thing that's hilarious 
about that restaurant,

282
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,880
which I like it.
The food is good,

283
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,560
but have you been there?
No.

284
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,730
So everyone,
now forgive me if this is no longer 

285
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,041
true,
but at one point every employee there 

286
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:50,041
did the,
um,

287
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,820
the landmark forum that the successor to
asked.

288
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,540
Oh,
that's right.

289
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,210
They get sued for that.
Who gets this?

290
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:55,720
This,
this,

291
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,720
this restaurant is one of the reasons 
why they closed one of the restaurants.

292
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,790
Can you explain that though?
Because.

293
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,990
Okay,
so landmarks.

294
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:02,170
So,

295
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,230
um,
which I've never done this.

296
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:06,330
So again,
I'm speaking outside the,

297
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,650
the cult walls.
But um,

298
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,380
so runner earhart was a,
a sixties.

299
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,310
Um,
you know,

300
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:17,810
human potential figure who started 
asked,

301
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm never met him,
um,

302
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,540
but,
uh,

303
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:26,590
you know,
obviously impressive enough as a person 

304
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,420
to get a lot of people to spend a lot of
time doing whatever he said.

305
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,250
And he had this,
he had this,

306
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,520
um,
a growth,

307
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,560
a course called asked,
which has been,

308
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,860
I mean,
you've seen it in many movies,

309
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:45,861
no name comes to mind now,
but some version of this where you can 

310
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,861
keep everyone in the room and the people
have to ask permission to go to the 

311
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,130
bathroom and there's kind of like a 
pressure cooker situation socially where

312
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:55,131
you have everyone sort of torn down.
I'm actually the classic case of this,

313
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:02,781
I think this,
this wasn't ss was the forum which is 

314
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:02,781
now the successor to.

315
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:05,790
So they were at one point hired to do 
coaching,

316
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,470
uh,
of,

317
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,400
you know,
various companies.

318
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:11,620
And I think they're hired by the FAA.
I wrote about this in one of my books in

319
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,640
a footnote.
It was the FAA FAA hired the forum to 

320
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,380
coach their,
their,

321
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,880
um,
uh,

322
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,430
administrators.
And one of the exercises they a force 

323
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,230
these guys to do is,
they almost certainly were mostly guys,

324
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,500
um,
they chained the boss to his secretary 

325
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,210
and had for like the whole day and they 
had to go to the bathroom together and 

326
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,210
like sort of,
you know,

327
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,280
ego annihilating experience.
Anyway,

328
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,300
this is,
this is the recipe that,

329
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,140
that,
that,

330
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:48,150
um,
one of the recipes that asked is 

331
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,621
pioneered.
This is not to say that people don't go 

332
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:50,621
to the forum and get a lot out of it.
I,

333
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,040
I've actually met those people.
But

334
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,150
the,
um,

335
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,420
every employee of this restaurant 
apparently has gone or used to go do the

336
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,870
forum.
Um,

337
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,160
so it's a very,
you walk into the restaurant and your 

338
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,160
interaction with,
with people in the restaurant is,

339
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,030
is unlike most restaurants,
people are just very,

340
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,540
you know,
lots of eye contact and,

341
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,810
and it's just,
it's an intense,

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,040
it's intense restaurant.
And also the stuff on the menu,

343
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,110
um,
this was just so lacerating I could 

344
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,110
never comply.
But the,

345
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,980
um,
the name of everything on the menu is 

346
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:24,980
like,
I am humble,

347
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,970
I am magical alliance.
So you have to,

348
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,920
you're,
you're meant to order it that way.

349
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,740
Like I am humble.
Oh God,

350
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:36,860
I'll have an I am humble and they're 
given to you.

351
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:38,910
It's your humble.
So that's that.

352
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,600
That becomes a little of.
That goes a long way.

353
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,380
Well,
they're retarded.

354
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,290
That's what's going on.
And if you go to is good though.

355
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,100
I,
I don't,

356
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:50,150
uh,
don't get me the wrong way.

357
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:55,151
The food is good,
but it makes sense then that they would 

358
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,791
go all Jesus,
he religiousy when they were trying to 

359
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:57,791
justify their meat consumption.
Jamie,

360
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,680
see soon as you pull up the quotes for 
them,

361
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,840
a justifying their meat consumption 
because it was real weird.

362
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,190
I was like,
how weird is that?

363
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:09,191
These guys are like using Jesus and 
religion to justify eating cows when 

364
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:10,130
they've been a Vegan for all those 
years.

365
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,130
What did you not listen to Jesus all 
those other years?

366
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:14,000
Like you're like,
fuck you,

367
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:15,320
Jesus.
I'm not eating meat.

368
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,590
Like what was the,
what was the turnaround there?

369
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:20,390
It doesn't make any sense.
Well,

370
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,200
I don't think you can pull veganism out 
of the Bible unless you know a.

371
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,310
well,
I guess if you go back to the garden and

372
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,820
there's nothing about them eating meat,
right?

373
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,740
It's just,
it was all provided from the trees.

374
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,820
There's no slaughterhouse in the garden 
and Riparian Ism is fairly old.

375
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Mean.
Vegetarianism has been around in Hindu 

376
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:39,900
cultures and so many different cultures 
forever,

377
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,630
but not veganism.
Right?

378
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,120
I mean,
veganism is really fairly recent.

379
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:49,121
It's pretty impractical in history.
Okay.

380
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,520
Hurting remanence of our best tool to 
restore fertility to the earth.

381
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:56,840
Keep the earth covered in reverse.
Desertification and climate change.

382
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:59,260
He wrote,
we need cows to keep the earth alive.

383
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,670
Cows make an extreme sacrifice for 
humanity,

384
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,900
but that's their position in God's plan 
as food for the predators.

385
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,790
Whoa.
Huh.

386
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,070
That's a strange quote,
but I think there was more of them,

387
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,720
but that's good enough.
But there was.

388
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:15,740
There was more of that kind of stuff.
Like all the sudden he's a predator.

389
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,100
Predators go after animals.
They chase him down and they kill them.

390
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,840
It,
I guess we're kind of predators in a 

391
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,161
way,
but we're some new thing where some 

392
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:30,161
completely new thing.
We.

393
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:34,240
We use weapons or we corral them and if 
you've got them corralled and you just 

394
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,291
stick in that no country for old men 
thing in their head and killing them 

395
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,170
with it,
I mean that's what they're doing,

396
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:40,440
right?
If you're doing that,

397
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,450
it's like,
I don't know if you're allowed to call 

398
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:45,450
yourself a predator.
Well,

399
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,090
historically were predatory and chimps 
are predators.

400
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,890
Know not.
Not entirely,

401
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,040
but they are that

402
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,280
too.

403
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,620
We're certainly a kind of a Predator,
but we're so much different now and this

404
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:59,621
is what we're talking about.
We're talking about factory farming and 

405
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,660
these weird businesses where they slam 
all these animals,

406
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,670
these entirely too small places and they
live in their own feces and urine and 

407
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,790
I'm sure you've seen that drone footage 
from the pig farm.

408
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,480
I've seen a lot of pig farm footage,
but I don't know if I've seen drone 

409
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,941
footage.
I don't think I've seen lakes of urine 

410
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:18,941
feces.
It's disgusting.

411
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:19,710
It's unbelievable.
They,

412
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:23,600
this guy flew this thing.
I mean they have these ag gag laws which

413
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:24,700
are evil.
Oh yeah,

414
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,200
and if you don't know what those means,
what that means.

415
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Ag Gag laws are laws that they make it a
federal crime to show all of the abuse 

416
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:40,451
of these animals,
to show factory farming because it'll 

417
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:43,871
affect the business so drastically and 
so radically when people are exposed to 

418
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:46,370
the truth that they've made it illegal.
Those laws should be illegal.

419
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,440
Those laws are scary.
They're scary aspect of human beings.

420
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,440
I've never seen this with some toxic 
lake.

421
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,540
It's a lake of pee and poop and all 
those things are stuffed to the gills 

422
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:57,710
with pigs.

423
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,980
Yeah.
That is a book,

424
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:00,970
um,
uh,

425
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,850
eating animals,
Jonathan Safran [inaudible] book,

426
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:08,851
which is worth reading if you think 
you're immune to the details because 

427
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,940
it's just.
I mean,

428
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,590
there's the,
there's two aspects to it.

429
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:15,760
There's the cruelty aspect,
which is actually three aspects.

430
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,530
There's the cruelty aspect,
which is horrific.

431
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,070
Um,
there's the environmental energy use 

432
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,970
issue which has also just totally 
untenable.

433
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:31,050
And then there's just the,
if you have any concern about your own 

434
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,410
health and the contamination,
I mean just,

435
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:37,411
just the getting all these antibiotics 
that weren't prescribed to you that you 

436
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,831
don't want,
but it's still getting into you through 

437
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:40,831
this,
this food chain.

438
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,730
Um,
and I mean,

439
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:47,110
just the stuff that they like the 
chickens,

440
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:47,400
I mean,
the,

441
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,430
the,
the details about chicken farming is 

442
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:52,710
almost the most horrible.
But I mean,

443
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,240
they're,
they're,

444
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,850
they're covered in just,
uh,

445
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,060
just the,
the foulest uh,

446
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,400
no pun intended.

447
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,730
Just the most disgusting material they 
go into like a broth that's just like 

448
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,830
pure bacteria and um,
uh,

449
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I mean they have to be washed with just 
ammonia or whatever they put on them.

450
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:18,091
I mean,
it's just to really wash with a moment 

451
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,091
that I,
I forget the details,

452
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,230
but it's just the read Jonathan Safran 
Safran for his book on this.

453
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,970
It's just,
um,

454
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,360
the,
uh,

455
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,860
the details of what goes on from the 
chickens.

456
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:29,860
Actually,
I think largely because they're so small

457
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,310
and it more of the process of killing 
them as automated,

458
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,860
that they almost get the worst of it 
because they're,

459
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,460
I mean,
they're just,

460
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:41,461
they're like,
they're getting singed before they're 

461
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:41,461
done before that.
I mean,

462
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:41,461
there's just,
it's just not.

463
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,270
I mean,
at least with a cow,

464
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:46,600
you've got a single person interacting 
with a single cow,

465
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:47,720
however,
and it's,

466
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,170
there's less chaos and in,
in the machinery,

467
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:53,290
but chicken is just get 'em pulverized.

468
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,700
And um,
I think,

469
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,280
I mean,
that's arguably,

470
00:20:57,281 --> 00:21:02,281
that's the one of the greatest pain 
points ethically comes around just just 

471
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,700
egg industry because fully half the 
chickens that the male chicks just 

472
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,930
immediately get,
get thrown into a,

473
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,990
literally like a meat grinder because 
they're not the same chicken that is a 

474
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,720
broiler chicken.
I mean,

475
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,120
the genetically they're not the same.
They don't,

476
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,600
they don't grow into the same kind of 
chicken that would be useful.

477
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:23,240
So they,
they're,

478
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,800
they're useless.
And so they don't lay eggs and you,

479
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,920
you don't eat them.
And so they just get a,

480
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,350
literally just fed into a,
like a woodchipper,

481
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,730
uh,
alive.

482
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,860
I mean there's no,
and again,

483
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,890
this is in some ways an artifact of them
being so small that it would be so much 

484
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,151
of a Ha,
just too much of a hassle to stun them 

485
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:45,151
appropriately.
Right.

486
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:46,200
If they had to.
They made a law.

487
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,600
We had to bury them all and put little 
crosses in the ground.

488
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,060
The labor intensive Jesus.
I mean I was like millions and billions,

489
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:59,241
you know,
I was on the highway and there was a 

490
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:00,771
chicken truck that was passing me,
one of those trucks that's containing 

491
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:04,401
live chickens and they just stacked to 
stacked and cages on top of each other 

492
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:07,890
cage on top of cage just shitting on 
each other and I'm watching this and I'm

493
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:12,891
like,
it's so weird that we're allowed to do 

494
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:13,170
that with some animals.
Like if you were doing that with horses,

495
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:18,171
people would lose their fucking minds.
Have you had dogs in boxes like that 

496
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,460
stacked and in the open air on the 
highway and you're driving down the road

497
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:21,690
with them.
People would freak out,

498
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,240
but no one bats an eye at these 
chickens.

499
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,970
This chicken truck is.
It's chickens or weird thing.

500
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:31,971
We have like a hierarchy of animals that
we love and we're not really big into 

501
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:33,660
reptiles,
not really big into birds.

502
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It has something to do,
I think with facial expressiveness a 

503
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:44,881
little bit.
And Mr Fisher also away down like the 

504
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,551
fact that fish have these cold 
expressionless faces no matter what 

505
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:47,551
happens,
that,

506
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:48,850
that's,
that cuts down on empathy,

507
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,150
but I think its size,
its facial display and it's also the 

508
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,560
sounds they make,
right?

509
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:56,970
So,
you know,

510
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,040
if a lobster could scream every time it 
went to the pot,

511
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,230
you know,
um,

512
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,340
it would be,
it'd be a different encounter with,

513
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:08,390
you know,
just how much do I want to eat this 

514
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,390
thing.
Um,

515
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,420
uh,
and so something obviously like an ape 

516
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:12,420
or something that's cute.
I mean,

517
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,030
it's amazing what a,
what a fluffy tail will get you the 

518
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,030
difference between a squirrel and a rat.
Right.

519
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,170
It's crazy.
It is crazy.

520
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,060
Squirrels could just hang out with 
everybody.

521
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,040
We're cool with them.
They look so close to rats.

522
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,600
So like,
God,

523
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:27,810
I'm so close.
It's like a hot girl sister.

524
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,580
It's like,
what the fuck?

525
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:30,090
Like,
so,

526
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,120
so much so close.
There was an article today about some 

527
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,631
woman who had rescued a lobster from a 
restaurant and dropped it off in the 

528
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:44,061
ocean and the journey of this all and 
how you should think of this lobster or 

529
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:46,220
something with a cute,
and if you did,

530
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,220
then you would appreciate her efforts 
and understand that this lobster,

531
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,700
even though they're not even capable of 
feeling pain in lobsters,

532
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,830
they don't have enough nervous system.
Their nervous systems aren't strong 

533
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,220
enough for them to feel pain.
They don't have the same sort of sensors

534
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,630
that we have.
Allegedly.

535
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,410
Yeah,
I don't.

536
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,520
I,
I,

537
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,060
I've threatened to do this actually when
I.

538
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,080
When I decided to become a vegetarian,
I said at some point maybe I will just 

539
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,390
do a,
a,

540
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:13,490
a taxonomy of the kind of a comparative 
neuroanatomy across species just to see 

541
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:16,340
where we could plausibly say,
you know,

542
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,620
the suffering really begins to matter.
The killing anything.

543
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,290
No.
Actually,

544
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:26,291
there,
there are what are called by Val vegans 

545
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,481
who eat clams and oysters and Mussels,
and I could get into that because they 

546
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:28,481
think that,
you know,

547
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:33,401
there's no way you can make an argument 
that there's no basis for suffering 

548
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:33,401
there.

549
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:34,240
Well,
if there's no feeling,

550
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:37,370
there's no suffering,
my argument against that Tau is lobsters

551
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,980
are clearly not happy when you throw 
them in boiling water.

552
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,910
So what's that reaction?
I think anything that can behave,

553
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,280
they can move right and move away from 
the stimulus,

554
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,490
the,
the evolutionary rationale for it to 

555
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,070
experience pain on the question of 
consciousness is difficult.

556
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,480
You know,
where consciousness emerges.

557
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:01,370
And I think there is clearly an 
unconscious pain mechanisms,

558
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,120
the same mechanisms that give us pain at
a certain level.

559
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,080
We can be unconscious and yet they can 
be just as effective.

560
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,520
I mean,
all of our reflexes are like that.

561
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:15,521
So you touch a hot stove,
you're pulling your hand away actually 

562
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:16,810
before you consciously registering.
Um,

563
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,400
and that's as it should be because 
you're faster that way.

564
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Um,
so it's possible to have unconscious 

565
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,071
pain,
but anything they can move very quickly 

566
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:31,961
is going to evolve and ability to move 
away from noxious stimuli and that,

567
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,990
um,
uh,

568
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:38,030
there's every reason to make that,
you know,

569
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:38,390
in,
in,

570
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:43,391
in evolutionary terms as salient and is 
as urgent as possible,

571
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,100
and then our pain responds is that for 
us,

572
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:51,101
and there's no reason to withhold that 
from any other animal that's clearly 

573
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:53,590
avoiding stuff with all of its power,
right?

574
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Yeah.
It seems to me that there's got to be 

575
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,250
all the way down to mushrooms because 
everybody eats mushrooms,

576
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,640
even vegans,
but mushrooms breathe in oxygen and they

577
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:09,641
breathe out carbon dioxide.
They're way closer to humans than they 

578
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:11,000
really are to plants.
They're weird.

579
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,360
They're a strange sort of an organism 
that's been mushrooms.

580
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,660
Yeah.
They're not necessarily like a plant.

581
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,720
I mean,
we think of them as a plan because they 

582
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:22,720
grow,
but they're a fungus.

583
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,280
It's a type of life form and they 
interlink through the mycelium.

584
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,980
It will.
Terence Mckenna.

585
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,630
Okay.
If you got him talking on mushrooms long

586
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,620
enough,
he would,

587
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,630
uh,
it's very spooky stuff that he thought 

588
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:35,870
about them.
But there's no nervous system there.

589
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,240
I think the crucial,
um,

590
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,340
variable is the complexity of a nervous 
system.

591
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,220
So suffering and pain and emotions.
Yeah,

592
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:47,970
I mean,
just when you're,

593
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:51,600
when you're.
So there's suffering is one component of

594
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:56,601
it,
but then there's just the question of 

595
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:57,790
what sort of experience can this 
creature be deprived?

596
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,520
Right?
So when you ask like,

597
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,770
why is it a tragedy or why would it be a
tragedy to,

598
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,540
to kill someone painlessly in their 
sleep,

599
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,710
right?
So there's no suffering there.

600
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:12,711
Right?
And if anything you've just ended 

601
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:12,711
whatever suffering they were going to 
have in their future,

602
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:15,390
why would that be a tragedy if it 
happened to all of us tonight?

603
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,050
Right?
Just,

604
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,410
you know,
this,

605
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:21,411
um,
some neurotoxin comes down from space 

606
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:24,441
and kills us all in our sleep and no 
suffering is associated with it.

607
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,030
The only,
uh,

608
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:27,990
you know,
ethically speaking,

609
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:30,600
the only problem there,
and it's a huge one,

610
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:35,601
is that it forecloses all of the 
possible happy future is most of us are,

611
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,080
all of us are,
at least some of us we're going to have.

612
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:44,081
So the,
all of the good things that we could 

613
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:44,910
have done over the next million years 
aren't going to get done.

614
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,590
Um,
all of the beauty,

615
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:48,120
all the creativity,
all of the joy,

616
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,220
all of that just gets canceled.
Um,

617
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,260
and so,
so leaving the,

618
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,300
the painfulness of pain aside,
you know,

619
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,310
why is it wrong to deprive any given 
animal of life?

620
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:06,590
Well,
they're in so far as that life has any 

621
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,991
intrinsic value in so far as that in so 
far as the being that animal is better 

622
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,220
than being nothing.
Right?

623
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,980
Then you're also just canceling all of 
that good stuff.

624
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,600
And for that,
you know,

625
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,320
for any good stuff,
you need a,

626
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,600
a nervous system.
Yeah.

627
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,870
If and for any pain you need to.
Nervous system.

628
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,310
So far as we understand this,
um,

629
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,520
though there are people who say any good
stuff,

630
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,420
what do you experience any original 
movement though,

631
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,480
right?
Like being prejudice about the 

632
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,600
experiences that plants are having been 
by being immobile,

633
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,820
you know,
have you ever thought ever paid 

634
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,590
attention to some of the more recent 
research on plant intelligence and weird

635
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,590
stuff that's going on with them?

636
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,590
Calculations and they're exuding,
I'm expressing some sense that causes a 

637
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,130
when they're being eaten,
causes other other plants.

638
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,550
Downwind changed their flavor to avoid 
predation.

639
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,540
There was a New Yorker article on this.
I forget when this came out.

640
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,380
We.
It's weird.

641
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,360
There's weird.
There's weird stuff that plants do,

642
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,600
which,
and I remember the details of that 

643
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,631
article aren't so clear to me.
I remember not knowing what to think 

644
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:14,571
about some of it,
but some of it clearly can be explained 

645
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:17,220
in evolutionary terms.
That doesn't imply any experience.

646
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,280
It just,
it could all be dark and it's all blind 

647
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,280
mechanism,
but so the,

648
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,160
it still has consciousness.
The consciousness as we know it is.

649
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:28,110
What's most valuable to you?
Well,

650
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:31,050
I think it's the only thing that's 
valuable to anything.

651
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,150
It's like when you're going to talk 
about value,

652
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,420
so it's like,
you know,

653
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,910
if this,
if this cup has no experience,

654
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:39,120
right?

655
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,120
So if,
if my trading places with it insofar as 

656
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,501
you can make sense of that concept is 
synonymous with just canceling my 

657
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:48,450
experience.
Well then there's,

658
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,530
there's,
this cup is unconscious.

659
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,240
There's nothing that is like to be the 
cup.

660
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:56,110
When I break it,
I haven't created a suffering.

661
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,190
I haven't,
I haven't done anything unethical to the

662
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:05,191
cup,
I have no ethical responsibilities 

663
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:08,311
toward the cup,
but the moment you give me something 

664
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:10,381
that can be made happy or be made 
miserable depending on how I behave 

665
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:12,970
around it or toward it,
well then I'm,

666
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,110
I'm ethically entangled with it.
And then it's.

667
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,170
And then,
and that begins to scale.

668
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,570
I'm in,
I think in a fairly linear way with just

669
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,380
how complex the thing is.
So,

670
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:27,330
and this is maybe something we even 
talked about on a previous podcast.

671
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,450
Um,
you know,

672
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,470
if I'm driving home today and I know bug
hits my windshield,

673
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,860
you know that that has whatever ethical 
implication it has,

674
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:40,861
but it's given what I believe about bugs
and given how small they are and given 

675
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:45,400
how little they do and given how 
primitive their nervous systems are,

676
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,250
um,
you know,

677
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,750
I'm not going to lose sleep over,
you know,

678
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,990
killing a bug.

679
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,680
If I hit a squirrel,
I'm going to feel worse.

680
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,340
If I had a dog,
I'm going to feel worse than his son was

681
00:30:56,341 --> 00:31:01,341
a kid.
Obviously I may never get over it and 

682
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:01,341
even if I live to be a thousand,
right,

683
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:03,370
so the,
the scaling and,

684
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:08,080
and granted there are cultural 
accretions there so you can.

685
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:11,590
I justify that the way I feel about a 
dog as opposed to a deer,

686
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:12,730
you know,
that there's a difference,

687
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:18,150
but the difference is one of richness of
experience in so far as we understand 

688
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,120
what other species experience,

689
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,100
you could make that argument to justify 
eating animals as opposed to being 

690
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,470
accountable.
Right?

691
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,220
You could say,
well,

692
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,520
what kind of experiences a deer have?
They're just running around the woods.

693
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,070
Try not to get eaten.
They eat grass they made.

694
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,100
It's very simple.
It's a very simple experience in 

695
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,531
comparison to your average person that 
lives in Los Angeles that reads books,

696
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,160
you know,
I mean someone who goes into a lot of 

697
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,160
trips,
someone has a lot of loved ones.

698
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,640
Someone who has a great career.
Someone who's deeply invested in their 

699
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,640
work.
Yeah.

700
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,800
Is much more.
Yeah.

701
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,990
Yeah.
There's much more complexity and the 

702
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,781
deer behave just as deer all over the 
place and it's a very primitive sort of 

703
00:31:59,781 --> 00:31:59,810
a life form.
Well,

704
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,840
if you go further and further back,
like what did.

705
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,910
It seems like you can keep going with 
that and one of the things that I that 

706
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,540
concerns me the most about plants,
not concerns me but puzzles me the most 

707
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,500
about plants is whether or not the way I
look at them,

708
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:15,540
me personally,
my prejudices about them,

709
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:19,350
I just not thinking at all of them as 
being conscious.

710
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:25,070
What if we think about things in terms 
of the complexity of their experiences,

711
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:30,111
just because we're,
we're prejudiced about things that move 

712
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:30,650
made.
It's entirely possible that like,

713
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,930
it's going to sound really stupid,
but I've said a lot of stupid shit.

714
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:37,080
I went into a grow room once,
like a pot grow room,

715
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,160
right?
This guy had his Mac daddy room and

716
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,270
I walked in.
I was like,

717
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,120
this is like being in a room full of 
people.

718
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,850
This feels weird as fuck.
It felt.

719
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:52,030
It felt very weird.
It felt like there was a tangible like 

720
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,350
vibe of life in there and there's no 
other way to describe that without 

721
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,740
sounding like a complete moron,
but,

722
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,170
but,
but it was my experience.

723
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,120
I know what it's like to be that more 
on,

724
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,870
but you know what I mean.
Take enough acid.

725
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,880
You know what you're talking.
I'm not saying that we shouldn't eat 

726
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:09,880
plants.
I'm not done.

727
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,681
I've seen people were ready up in arms 
with their twitter fingers ready to get 

728
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:17,201
off,
but what I am saying is it's entirely 

729
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:19,841
possible that all things that are alive 
have some sort of a way of of being 

730
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,820
conscious.
May Not be mobile,

731
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
may not be as expressive,
but there might be the stillness of you 

732
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:31,760
without language when you're in a place 
of complete peace,

733
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,890
when you're in a zen meditative state.

734
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:39,370
What about that?
Stillness is really truly associated 

735
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,101
with being a human are really,
truly associated with being an English 

736
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:44,120
speaking person in North America.
Almost nothing.

737
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,740
It's just an existence.
Right,

738
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,190
and then everything else sort of 
branches out from that and then humans,

739
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:54,370
we all make the agreement that of course
it branches out far further and wider 

740
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,581
than any other animal,
but how do we know that these plants 

741
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:57,581
aren't branching out like that too?
How do we know that?

742
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:00,650
Then if they're having some 
communication with each other,

743
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,890
if they're responding to probation,
if they're literally changing their 

744
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,430
flavor,
they're doing all these calculations and

745
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:12,431
all these strange things that they're 
finding out that plants are capable of 

746
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:12,431
doing,
like what?

747
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:14,930
What is going on there?
We don't know necessarily.

748
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,100
I'm agnostic on the question of how far 
down consciousness goes and I agree that

749
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:26,471
there's very likely a condition of 
something like pure consciousness that 

750
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:31,031
really is separable from the details of 
any given species.

751
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,130
I mean it's something that I've 
experienced myself.

752
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,160
It feels like you certainly have this 
experience,

753
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:38,750
what you know,
what its implications are.

754
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I don't know,
but you can have the experience of just 

755
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,431
consciousness and it doesn't have any 
personal or even human reference point,

756
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,660
so it's not.
It's not.

757
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:55,661
You're not even.
It doesn't even have a reference point 

758
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,230
in one of the channel that the human 
sense channels so you're not seeing.

759
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:02,231
You're not hearing,
you're not smelling and you're not 

760
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,130
thinking and you're yet.
You are.

761
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:09,210
So there is still just open conscious 
experience and whether that is.

762
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,640
That is what it's like to be a plant.
I don't know because I don't know what 

763
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,721
the relationship between consciousness 
and information processing in the brain 

764
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:21,770
actually is though.
It's not,

765
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:22,310
you know,
it's,

766
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:24,110
it's totally plausible.
In fact,

767
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,230
um,
I think it's probably the most plausible

768
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,260
thesis that there is some direct 
connection between information 

769
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,870
processing and integrated information 
processing and consciousness and that 

770
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,130
and that there is nothing that's like to
be this

771
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,390
cup and,
you know,

772
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:41,810
the atoms are not conscious and,
and,

773
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,450
and,
but yet,

774
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:46,170
but that the thesis that every,
that consciousness goes all the way down

775
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,530
into the,
the most basic constituents of matter,

776
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,170
um,
that,

777
00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:55,270
that thesis is called Panpsychism and 
philosophy and that's pan everywhere.

778
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,020
A psych is a mind.
Um,

779
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,020
so that the mind is sometimes everywhere
in nature.

780
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,990
That's not,
you can't rule that out.

781
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:09,100
I mean,
there's nothing we know about the world 

782
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,510
to rule that out.
What I think you can rule out is,

783
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,210
um,
the,

784
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:18,010
the,
the richness of the content of 

785
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,270
consciousness in these species.
And so,

786
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,660
so plants are not having conversations 
like this,

787
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,690
right?
So plants don't understand what we're 

788
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:26,690
doing.
There's no way they would.

789
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:26,690
There's just.
No,

790
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,310
they don't have nervous systems,
they're not there,

791
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,320
they can't be processing information in 
a way that would give them what we know 

792
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,990
as a,
as a rich experience.

793
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:37,620
But your point about the timescale and 
movement is,

794
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:39,070
um,
is totally valid if,

795
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:44,071
if,
if every time you walked into a room 

796
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:44,250
you're affirmed,
just turned and looked at you,

797
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,550
just oriented towards you and followed 
you around the room with its,

798
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,340
with its leading branch,
you would feel very different about,

799
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,410
it's the possibility that it's 
conscious,

800
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:55,650
right?

801
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,070
You'd be a good person to ask this,
but is that a,

802
00:36:58,071 --> 00:37:00,240
an urban myth that if you sing to your 
plants,

803
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,440
your plants,
music,

804
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:02,220
that they grow better?

805
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,180
Uh,
I haven't looked into it.

806
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:05,500
I would have.

807
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,640
When you define,
I would bet that it is.

808
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:12,641
Yes.
It sounds like one of those things will 

809
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:12,641
chicks who like crystals tell you.
Yeah,

810
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:12,641
no.
Yeah,

811
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,060
I would bet.
I would bet that it is.

812
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,970
I sing to my flowers and they grow so 
beautiful.

813
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:22,330
Yeah.
It seems like one of those things that 

814
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,771
people say,
I'm definitely not insinuating that 

815
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:23,771
plants would have as rich and experience
as human beings,

816
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:25,630
but I don't think a deer has as rich an 
experience.

817
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:25,950
No,
no.

818
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,100
As a human being either.
And it's just to me,

819
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:28,890
my,
um,

820
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:33,970
my,
my curiosity lies in the future of 

821
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,130
understanding plant intelligence.
Like wouldn't it be fascinating if we 

822
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,130
found out that they,
like,

823
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,570
one of the reasons why psychedelic drugs
puzzled me so much is that they exist 

824
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,930
and there's a lot of plants you could 
just eat them and you have your brain 

825
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:47,990
already has this place.

826
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,880
It'll go.
If you eat these plants,

827
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,590
like if you eat pod,
if you,

828
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:55,580
uh,
if you try the San Pedro cactus out this

829
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,160
spring,
uh,

830
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,410
you,
you can,

831
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,560
you can have these really powerful 
psychedelic experiences just from a 

832
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,251
plant.
Like why does the human mind interact 

833
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:06,530
with these plants like that?
Like especially fungus,

834
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,410
like when you have like major league 
mushroom trips,

835
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:14,411
it's very strange sort of feeling like 
you're in communication with another 

836
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,730
Mckenna described it best in that way.
That there's someone there that it's not

837
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:27,701
just you and hallucinations.
It has this distinct feeling that 

838
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:32,010
there's someone there and that someone 
according to the.

839
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:35,360
The hippiest of hippies is plan 
intelligence.

840
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,450
It's my mother,
Gaia.

841
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,460
It's the earth itself.
It's all life.

842
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,690
It's love.
It's God.

843
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:45,691
It's all.
It all exists inside the intelligence 

844
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:48,901
that's intertwined in nature.
It's one of the most things that one of 

845
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:51,070
the things that's most puzzling about 
the most potent of all psychedelics,

846
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:56,071
which is dimethyltryptamine,
that it's in so many different plants 

847
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:59,670
like to make dimethyltryptamine 
containing plants illegal would be 

848
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,811
hilarious because there'd be like 
hundreds and hundreds of plants they'd 

849
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:05,800
have to make illegal like including like
full Eris grass.

850
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,310
It's just really rich and five methoxy 
dimethyltryptamine,

851
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:11,440
which is the most potent potent form of 
it.

852
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,150
Also our own brains,
so every,

853
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:20,490
every brick,
every brain makes it a little weird 

854
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,260
little lizards that have retinas and 
lenses where their pineal gland is.

855
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,900
They're making it in their little screwy
little lizard brains.

856
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:28,220
We don't even know what the hell is for 
like the the,

857
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:33,221
the questions about are just so much.
There's so many more questions than 

858
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:33,550
there are answers.
They were like,

859
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,380
you've paid attention to,
um,

860
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,450
uh,
rick strassman stuff,

861
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,100
the general,
that book did you know,

862
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:44,101
that the cottonwood research foundation 
and actually found mice brains producing

863
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:49,801
dimethyltryptamine.
So it's been proven that it's actually 

864
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,440
been growing in the pineal gland,
the gland that they had always.

865
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

866
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:52,920
I,
I,

867
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,810
I had assumed that if I got that from 
the book or not,

868
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,710
but that's crazy

869
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,300
as a neuroscientist.
Like doesn't that kind of freak you out 

870
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,451
that those Egyptians had those third 
eyes and like all the eastern mysticism 

871
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:11,321
had that pineal gland highlighted.
It was like the on the end of shafts are

872
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:13,730
staff.
They would put those pine cones like how

873
00:40:13,731 --> 00:40:14,840
the hell they know all that.

874
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,620
Well,
there is a,

875
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I mean the third eye metaphor or I mean 
it's not as more than a metaphor,

876
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:23,910
you know,
anatomically,

877
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:24,960
but it's,
um,

878
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,940
it's a,
uh,

879
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:32,570
it's an,
it correlates with the kind of 

880
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,011
experience you can have.
I don't actually know if the experience 

881
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:37,311
people have.
That's the shocker of you need to talk 

882
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:38,850
in yoga terms.
Um,

883
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,680
I don't know if that has anything to do 
with the pineal gland,

884
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,850
I,
it may be because I don't know,

885
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,450
I don't think anyone's done this 
neuroimaging experiment where he can get

886
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:53,451
people who can reliably produce a,
a third eye opening sort of experience 

887
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,050
and,
and scan their brains while they do it.

888
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,860
In fact,
I'm almost positive that hasn't been 

889
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:00,860
done.
But,

890
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,731
um,
there is a phenomenology here of people 

891
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:07,911
having a kind of inner opening of,
it's almost certainly largely a matter 

892
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,580
of,
of visual cortex getting stimulated,

893
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:16,581
but you can,
you can meditate in such a way as to 

894
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:16,581
produce this experience.

895
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:17,030
And,
um,

896
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,790
it's also,
it's an experience that you have more or

897
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,220
less on,
on different psychedelics.

898
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Psychedelics are much more visual than 
others and certain doses in particular 

899
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,080
like mushrooms and DMT,
which I've never taken,

900
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:31,740
which,
which,

901
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,100
you know,
you can say better than I,

902
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:39,101
but it's,
it's reported to be quite visual and 

903
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:39,101
the,
um,

904
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,970
the experience,
uh,

905
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:42,950
so in most people when they close their 
eyes,

906
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:47,951
unless they have to,
having hypnogogic imagery is before 

907
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:47,951
sleep or they just have to happen to be,
you know,

908
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:50,720
super good visualizers of,
of imagery.

909
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,140
You close your eyes and you just 
basically have darkness there right now 

910
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:00,581
that now if you close your eyes and if 
you're listening to this and you close 

911
00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:01,130
your eyes and you look into the darkness
of your closed eyes,

912
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,710
this,
that actually is,

913
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,860
that's it.
That's a,

914
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:09,080
that is as much your visual field as it 
is when your eyes are open,

915
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:09,470
right?

916
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,470
I mean,
it's not like your visual field hasn't 

917
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,470
gone away when you close your eyes.
It's just,

918
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,790
it's now,
there's not much detail for you to 

919
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,360
notice again,
unless you are in some unusual state,

920
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,160
but that,
you know,

921
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,370
based on,
on different techniques of meditation.

922
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:28,370
And this happened spontaneously,
again,

923
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,980
with hypnogogic images or,
or with psychedelics,

924
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,700
that space can open up in to a,
just a massive world of visual display,

925
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:39,740
right?
So you can just see a full blown,

926
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:41,300
you know,
three d movie in there,

927
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,900
um,
and it's a,

928
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:46,330
uh,
um,

929
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,220
but most of us just take it for granted 
that when you close your eyes,

930
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,510
you,
you're functionally blind,

931
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:55,511
you can't see anything and you were not,
were not interested in that space,

932
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:59,960
but you can actually train yourself to 
look deeply into that space as a,

933
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,430
as a technique of meditation.

934
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:06,490
I don't want to interrupt you,
but does that have implications in 

935
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,621
people having eye witness testimony and 
eye witness experiences that turned out 

936
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:12,020
to not be true at all?
Because if you think about the,

937
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:12,670
the,
the,

938
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,680
the human mind and the imagination be 
able to being able to create imagery 

939
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,030
once the eyes are closed,
like you can in sensory deprivation 

940
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,941
tanks like 10 sensory deprivation tanks 
are that a lot of people's experiences 

941
00:43:24,941 --> 00:43:26,660
are very visual even though it's in 
complete darkness.

942
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,900
Now you know how people see things and 
they thought they saw something.

943
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:34,901
And it turns out to not be true at all,
whether it's big foot or whether it's a 

944
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:38,351
robbery or a suspect,
and they get the details completely 

945
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:41,740
outright,
but isn't it possible that under fear 

946
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,340
and when your your pulse is jacked up 
and your adrenaline's running and you're

947
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:51,041
worried about all these possibilities in
your imagination starts formulating 

948
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:55,720
predetermined possibilities.
You should be looking out for like what 

949
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,090
if it's big foot?
What if it's a Robert Wood?

950
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:01,091
If it's an alien,
what if it's at this and then these 

951
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:03,100
people that swear they saw these things 
that everybody knows they didn't like.

952
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,150
Maybe there was video footage or for 
whatever it was.

953
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,420
Is it possible that your brain can do 
that?

954
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:13,421
Two,
U and t can literally show you things 

955
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:13,421
that aren't real?

956
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:14,490
Oh yeah,
I can do that.

957
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,550
Although I think the unreliability of of
witness testimony and it's shockingly 

958
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:25,311
unreliable,
is more a matter of memory that the 

959
00:44:25,311 --> 00:44:29,070
corruption of memory and the way 
memories are recall are there especially

960
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:34,071
vulnerable when you're recalling them 
can be revised when you were in the act 

961
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:39,831
of recall.
And it's very easy to tamper with 

962
00:44:39,831 --> 00:44:39,831
people's memory,
you know,

963
00:44:39,831 --> 00:44:42,450
albeit inadvertently.
I mean you can do this on purpose too,

964
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:47,451
but,
but people just do it with bad 

965
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:47,451
interrogation techniques.
So you know,

966
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:47,451
the,
the,

967
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,590
the cop will ask you,
you know,

968
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,400
so when did you see the,
you know,

969
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:55,401
the woman at the crosswalk and he's just
put a woman at the crosswalk into your 

970
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:55,860
memory,
right?

971
00:44:55,861 --> 00:45:00,861
So because you,
you can't help it visualize a woman at 

972
00:45:00,861 --> 00:45:02,640
the crosswalk and his memory is very 
fragile.

973
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,700
And so when you're,
whenever you're giving an account of an 

974
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,990
experience,
even if it's an experience that happened

975
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,040
half a second ago,
now we're in the domain of memory.

976
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,720
Now we're in the domain of,
of,

977
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,820
of just what you can report a we're not,
it's not a matter of what you're 

978
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,410
consciously experiencing.
No.

979
00:45:22,411 --> 00:45:27,411
I know there was a case in India where I
believe it was a woman was convicted of 

980
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:32,751
murder through the use of an Fmr rye or 
a functioning magnetic resonance imagery

981
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:37,410
machine.
And through this Fmr I,

982
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:42,411
they determined in some strange way that
she had functional knowledge of the 

983
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:46,350
crime scene.
And the argument against that,

984
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:51,351
I believe,
was that she could have developed 

985
00:45:51,351 --> 00:45:54,960
functional memory of the crime scene by 
being told you're being prosecuted for a

986
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,640
crime.
You might go to jail for murder.

987
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:01,850
Here's the crime scene.
Like it's or just being unlucky enough 

988
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:05,700
to be familiar as,
I mean,

989
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,750
normally when this gets done and there 
are people who do it in the states,

990
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:12,180
but they don't use Fmri as their 
modality,

991
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:13,080
but they,
they do,

992
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:18,081
um,
they do sort of interrogate people's 

993
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:18,081
familiarity.

994
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:18,081
Uh,
and they,

995
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:18,810
they use eeg as a,
as a,

996
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,470
um,
as a way of monitoring.

997
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,300
Um,
uh,

998
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,130
their familiarity with those.
Show them,

999
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:31,270
you know,
if you are shown evidence from the crime

1000
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:34,440
scene that only the perpetrator could 
have seen,

1001
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,470
you know,
hopefully it's really something that 

1002
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:39,470
only the perpetrator could have seen.
But if,

1003
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,940
you know,
if they show you the picture and you 

1004
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:43,940
know,
you see the,

1005
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:43,940
Oh yeah,
you know,

1006
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,880
I have that Ikea End table and you know,
I have that dress from banana republic 

1007
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,070
or whatever.
Um,

1008
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:52,970
that just by dint of bad luck,
you're familiar with something that 

1009
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,120
you're being shown from the crime scene 
and especially if it's a murder,

1010
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:57,090
you're talking about someone who's.
She was probably intimate with.

1011
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,240
She probably knew them at least.
So she's probably been good house.

1012
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:05,270
Yeah,
I think that would be obviously a case 

1013
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,270
where you really couldn't do it at all.

1014
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,760
How does it work?
Why don't I know no one in the states as

1015
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:12,240
far as I know,
unless this has changed in the last year

1016
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,550
or so since I've paid attention to this.
You can't,

1017
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:17,310
this none.
None of this is admissible in court were

1018
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,520
only on India and it's only the one case
that I ever heard of crazy premature use

1019
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:25,020
of the technology.
But how does the technology work?

1020
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:30,021
Like what does it,
what does it actually seeing where you 

1021
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:30,021
have,
um,

1022
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:32,320
with Eeg,
I think this has worked out more.

1023
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:33,830
You can have a,
a,

1024
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:38,930
a,
a kind of a canonical familiarity 

1025
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,360
response to a stimuli.
If you've seen something,

1026
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:45,361
again,
if you've seen seen something for the 

1027
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:45,361
first time,
you know,

1028
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:47,140
is it would be a novelty response.
Seeing something for the third,

1029
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:49,960
fourth,
fifth time would be a different response

1030
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,730
and you can,
I mean,

1031
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:52,750
this has been,
um,

1032
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,040
uh,
again,

1033
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:59,050
it's been a long time since I've looked 
at this particular research and I don't 

1034
00:47:59,050 --> 00:47:59,050
know how,
you know,

1035
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,160
I don't know what they're calling these,
these wave forms now.

1036
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,160
I mean there was a p 300 wave form at 
one point and they're there way forms 

1037
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,940
that come from certain areas of the 
brain at certain timing intervals based 

1038
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:10,480
on,
you know,

1039
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,620
from the moment of,
of receiving a stimulus,

1040
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,270
you know,
let's say a photograph.

1041
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,480
Um,
and they are the hallmark of either 

1042
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,900
being familiar or not with this thing.
And um,

1043
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,810
yeah,
so I mean it's not,

1044
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,750
there's no question that at a certain 
point we will have reliable mind reading

1045
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,010
machines.
I think I'm not.

1046
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,990
I think it's really just a matter of 
time.

1047
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,320
I think there's also no question that we
don't have them now,

1048
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:44,290
at least not in a way that we can,
we can send some,

1049
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,950
send someone to prison on the basis of 
what their brain did an experiment.

1050
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,440
But I mean,
just,

1051
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,310
just as you,
I mean anything but a lot,

1052
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:59,330
a lot of this,
the most interesting stuff is 

1053
00:48:59,330 --> 00:48:59,830
unconscious,
but anything you're consciously aware of

1054
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:01,690
having seen before,
right?

1055
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,600
So if you,
if you were to show me this Cup,

1056
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:05,980
right?
And then,

1057
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:08,440
uh,
five seconds later say,

1058
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:10,430
is this the cup I showed you?
You know,

1059
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,430
I have a,
a very clear sense of.

1060
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,310
Yeah,
that's the cup,

1061
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:15,670
right?
So,

1062
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,950
and if you show me a completely 
different cup,

1063
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,960
I'm going to have a very clear internal 
sentiment.

1064
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,300
No,
that's.

1065
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,470
And that's not the cup.
If you're having that experience,

1066
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,670
you know,
that that is absolutely something about 

1067
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:33,631
the state of your brain that can be 
discriminated by a person outside your 

1068
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:40,471
brain running the appropriate experiment
is just our tools are still sufficiently

1069
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:43,110
course that,
you know,

1070
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,480
it's not like,
you know,

1071
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,690
sequencing your dna where we can say,
yeah,

1072
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:47,640
that was you.
And what's your,

1073
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:49,000
your uh,
blood at the crime scene.

1074
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,240
But,
um,

1075
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,040
eventually it will be,
it will be just,

1076
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:00,750
there'll be no basis to doubt it because
I'll be able to put you through a 

1077
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,131
paradigm where it'll just be clear,
I know your thoughts,

1078
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:06,760
right?

1079
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,850
So to think of how much faith you would 
have in this technology,

1080
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:14,851
if you could open your computer and read
any file a file of your choosing that I 

1081
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:17,860
have never seen,
right?

1082
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:21,530
So the contents of which are,
are completely blind,

1083
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:26,650
I'm completely blind to and I'm scanning
your brain while you're reading this 

1084
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,980
journal entry or a newspaper or 
whatever.

1085
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,040
And at the end of that I can say,
well,

1086
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,620
you know,
based on this report,

1087
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:38,621
you clearly read a story about Donald 
Trump and you,

1088
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:43,460
you actually don't like Donald Trump.
And I could tell you in detail about,

1089
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,520
you know,
what you were consciously thinking 

1090
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520
about,
um,

1091
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,980
you know,
if you did that,

1092
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,710
if you could do that 100 percent of the 
time,

1093
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,330
right?
At a certain point,

1094
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,350
the basis to doubt the validity of the 
mind reading machine would just go away.

1095
00:50:57,351 --> 00:50:58,350
You would just,
it would be like,

1096
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,500
you know,
it's like,

1097
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,100
are you here really hearing my voice 
right now?

1098
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,690
You certainly seem to,
you know,

1099
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:03,560
it's,
it's just,

1100
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,510
it would become a,
just a,

1101
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,850
a background assumption that the 
technology works at a certain point just

1102
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,400
as though the meat is scary.
The fake meat.

1103
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:16,630
That idea is terrifying.
The idea of losing the,

1104
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,070
the,
losing your thoughts.

1105
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,320
Yeah.
The ownership.

1106
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,410
Like losing a thought,
becoming non autonomous,

1107
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,650
like the idea of everybody sharing 
thoughts,

1108
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,690
it seems almost inevitable.
Well,

1109
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,300
this,
you know,

1110
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,390
I don't know that we would decide to do 
this.

1111
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,560
Certainly I don't think we would do.
We would do this all the time,

1112
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:41,561
right?
I mean it might be Sunday doing 

1113
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:41,561
something,
but no option.

1114
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:41,561
We might be compelled to do it.
I mean,

1115
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:42,890
if,
if you're at a murder trial,

1116
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,390
right?
If you,

1117
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,760
someone who may have killed somebody,
you,

1118
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,120
you,
I mean,

1119
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:52,140
the,
the fifth amendment becomes interesting 

1120
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,140
in that case.
But,

1121
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,140
um,
uh,

1122
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,020
we have worked that out for DNA 
evidence,

1123
00:51:54,021 --> 00:51:54,200
right?

1124
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,210
So you,
you have a right to take the fifth,

1125
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:59,360
but you don't have a right to withhold 
your blood from the proceeding.

1126
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,230
Right?
So I get,

1127
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:03,200
I get to look at your blood or your 
saliva so you don't have to talk,

1128
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:04,190
but I can read your mind.
Yeah.

1129
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,330
Yeah.
And that's,

1130
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,130
I think that's a.
well,

1131
00:52:07,131 --> 00:52:09,320
and it's,
this is like the iphone case,

1132
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:14,321
you know,
it's like I thus far decided that we 

1133
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:18,260
can't compel apple to unlock an iphone.
Uh,

1134
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,630
this is just the ultimate case of that.
So the,

1135
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,980
the argument in favor of apple is this 
is far too intimate and far too 

1136
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,330
comprehensive.
Look at a person's mind.

1137
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,340
Uh,
you know,

1138
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,140
once you have cracked their iphone,
you,

1139
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,480
you're basically walking around the 
corridors of their brain,

1140
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,720
um,
uh,

1141
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,100
that's a,
that's a slippery slope.

1142
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:45,101
We don't want to go down,
but ultimately we will be able to do it 

1143
00:52:45,101 --> 00:52:45,101
with brains.

1144
00:52:45,101 --> 00:52:50,020
And I think it obviously you're going 
gonna want all of the safeguards that 

1145
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:59,090
you can easily imagine and probably some
you have yet to imagine on this process,

1146
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:04,091
but safeguards in place.
I think this would be the best thing 

1147
00:53:04,091 --> 00:53:05,060
that could ever happen to us in terms 
of,

1148
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:05,810
of,
you know,

1149
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,960
when you look at a criminal justice 
system and that when you look at the 

1150
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,361
price we pay for not being able to tell 
whether someone is innocent or guilty or

1151
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:15,350
whether they're lying.
It is just,

1152
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:20,510
it is the most intolerable price that I 
see in society.

1153
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:25,511
It's just,
it's just the amount of human misery 

1154
00:53:25,511 --> 00:53:29,520
born of not being able to demonstrate 
that someone is lying reliably.

1155
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,830
It's just,
it's off.

1156
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,470
It's,
it's the biggest lever that would,

1157
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,480
I think we could pull certainly when you
have prisons that are filled with a lot 

1158
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:39,480
of people that are probably innocent.

1159
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:39,910
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1160
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:43,200
People who have gone to to the gallows,
no doubt.

1161
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:46,800
And we know innocent people who have 
been killed.

1162
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:50,580
And so one way to deal with as you be,
be against the death penalty.

1163
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:52,440
Right?
So there's always a chance to find their

1164
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:55,170
innocence.
But imagine being in prison on death row

1165
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:58,020
for 30 years and you know,
for rape or rape,

1166
00:53:58,021 --> 00:53:59,100
you didn't commit,
you know,

1167
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,380
it's um,
it's so horrible.

1168
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:02,790
Terrifying.
So yeah,

1169
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,540
that would be the major argument.
It would be such a simple solution.

1170
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:10,050
Really A,
now there are corner cases that wouldn't

1171
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:15,051
be solved.
I think there are people who are 

1172
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,000
delusional or easily self deceived who 
either would be lying and,

1173
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,030
but you know,
so convinced of the truth of their lives

1174
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:24,720
that they would pass this,
this lie detector presumably.

1175
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:30,290
Um,
and then there are people who are so 

1176
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:33,181
sick,
suggestible that they can be led to 

1177
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:33,181
believe something that's not true.

1178
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:37,280
I mean they'd be the people who can be 
convinced that you get these false 

1179
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,060
confessions of,
in response to a crime.

1180
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:39,520
I mean,
it's a,

1181
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,520
it's one of the strangest things in the 
world,

1182
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:42,080
but you know,
when,

1183
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,960
when someone gets murdered,
this doesn't get publicized very much.

1184
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:50,961
But it's a very common experience of 
police officers or police departments to

1185
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:56,301
hear from people in the community who 
are confessing to the crime and they 

1186
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:57,900
didn't commit it.
They just come in and they say,

1187
00:54:57,901 --> 00:54:58,560
I did it,
and they,

1188
00:54:58,561 --> 00:54:59,780
they give all this,
you know,

1189
00:54:59,781 --> 00:55:02,400
this bogus account of what happened and 
these,

1190
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,190
and this is a sign of mental illness or 
these,

1191
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:10,630
you know,
these are people I'm seeking attention 

1192
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:13,431
and some morbid way,
but there are people clearly who are so 

1193
00:55:13,431 --> 00:55:17,691
suggestible that they can either lead 
themselves to believe or be led by 

1194
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:23,190
others to believe that they've done 
things they didn't do.

1195
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,870
And,
and in,

1196
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,200
in just shocking detail.
There was another New Yorker article on,

1197
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:30,000
um,
uh,

1198
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,300
I think it was written by William 
Languish,

1199
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:33,970
um,
uh,

1200
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,460
this years ago,
but,

1201
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:36,200
uh,
on a,

1202
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:41,210
a satanic panic,
a case where a guy got a accused of 

1203
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,050
running a satanic cult,
uh,

1204
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,740
by I think his daughter who was in 
hypnosis,

1205
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,870
hypnosis recovery therapy,
right?

1206
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:57,360
Um,
so she had been led down the primrose 

1207
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,961
path by her therapist.
And so she obviously was fairly 

1208
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:04,461
suggestible and she recalled the most 
lurid,

1209
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,010
just insane Rosemary's baby style,
you know,

1210
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:11,970
cult,
uh,

1211
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,120
imaginable going on in her town where 
the friends of dad were coming over and 

1212
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,711
raping everyone.
And there was a human sacrifice of 

1213
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,240
infants and the infants were buried by 
the barn and um,

1214
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,500
she,
this,

1215
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
the dad was so suggestible that he just 
confessed and he was just,

1216
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:33,160
he and he was given more details and he 
went to prison.

1217
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,140
I don't know,
this is this now an old article.

1218
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,870
It's probably like 10 or 15 years old,
but this guy,

1219
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,000
this guy just fully confessed,
right?

1220
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,320
And,
uh,

1221
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,340
the journalist I believe was language.
Um,

1222
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,900
uh,
at the end they actually did a Ted guy 

1223
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:50,900
is now in prison,
right?

1224
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,930
The process is completed.
Justice has been done.

1225
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,300
Uh,
the daughter convinced that her,

1226
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:59,500
her dad has a satanic monster and uh,
as,

1227
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:04,501
as he,
and he's now in prison and they went in 

1228
00:57:04,501 --> 00:57:07,441
and interviewed him asking followup 
questions with just details that they 

1229
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:08,500
made up,
right?

1230
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:13,501
Because they began to suspect that he 
was just this kind of suggestibility 

1231
00:57:13,501 --> 00:57:13,501
machine,
right?

1232
00:57:13,501 --> 00:57:17,191
Who just would cop to anything.
And so they went in and they just made 

1233
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:17,350
up stuff like,
oh,

1234
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,040
you know,
there's,

1235
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,650
you know,
a few more details want to iron out.

1236
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:22,420
Your daughter said that there was a time
where,

1237
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:23,410
you know,
you got a,

1238
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:27,500
you brought in a horse and riding on the
horse and um,

1239
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,570
and then you killed the horse.

1240
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:28,840
I've,
I,

1241
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:34,230
I'm not,
I'm making these details up because I 

1242
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,230
don't remember.
But,

1243
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,230
um,
something that they just concocted.

1244
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,630
Right.
And he said,

1245
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,170
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1246
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:35,860
yeah.
That's,

1247
00:57:35,861 --> 00:57:36,530
um,
so,

1248
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,020
and he just copped to that.
It was,

1249
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:43,021
it became like a twilight zone.
It's like a perfect twilight zone 

1250
00:57:43,021 --> 00:57:45,121
episode where they,
like now you realize that this guy has 

1251
00:57:45,121 --> 00:57:45,940
been put away is just saying yes to 
everything.

1252
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,660
Right.
And that's,

1253
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,270
that's um,
so clearly that they resolve it.

1254
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,430
I don't know.
Again,

1255
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:56,431
I don't know if he ever wrote any 
followup on this because this as I 

1256
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:56,800
recall,
and this,

1257
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,720
uh,
this is like a 15 year old story.

1258
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,720
It just,
they ended with like,

1259
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:06,740
you know,
the twilight zone moment where now you 

1260
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:06,740
realize this guy is innocent and just 
saying yes to everything.

1261
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:09,840
And his daughter crazy,
she shares his jeans.

1262
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,200
I don't remember.

1263
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,670
I don't recall what the daughter did 
with that.

1264
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:14,710
Uh,
but he,

1265
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:16,260
um,
I mean the,

1266
00:58:16,261 --> 00:58:18,670
the story and perhaps there's more to 
the story,

1267
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:21,280
but the story on his face was totally 
exculpatory,

1268
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:26,281
like,
like the reader experience was you got 

1269
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:26,281
to let this guy out of prison tomorrow 
because you know,

1270
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,330
I'm fucked and he needed.
If he gets out and he's mine is probably

1271
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:36,331
so screwed up by this whole experience 
and if he really does believe that he 

1272
00:58:36,331 --> 00:58:39,580
ran these satanic rituals,
just the guilt and shame of it all.

1273
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,920
I mean we're assuming that his mind 
works.

1274
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,280
I mean this is the thing that I wonder 
how many people were like functionally 

1275
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,130
deeply,
deeply damaged,

1276
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,870
but they're functional.
Like they're there,

1277
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,590
they're going to the same schools and 
you go to,

1278
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:56,800
they work where you work,
but they're barely a person.

1279
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,260
They're like,
all their connections are all fucked up.

1280
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:01,150
Like if you went into the back wiring or
their head,

1281
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,340
if you were like an appliance repair 
person,

1282
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:04,750
like sell your TV's not working.
Huh?

1283
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,660
Let me go back here.
What the fuck is all this mean?

1284
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:12,661
How many people are like that,
that are just sort of kind of 

1285
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:15,181
functional?
My question is if we do get to a point 

1286
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:18,361
where you could read minds,
what if you go into their minds and you 

1287
00:59:18,361 --> 00:59:18,361
find out,
well,

1288
00:59:18,361 --> 00:59:21,010
this is what they really think,
like this is not a liar,

1289
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,190
this is a person

1290
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,200
who's seeing things that aren't there,
like a person who's completely 

1291
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,240
delusional,
like people that have these.

1292
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,540
I'm hallucinating a hallucinogenic 
visions like some people have like 

1293
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,690
really like deeply troubling visual 
images that they see match.

1294
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:44,710
If he's poor,
fucking people really are seeing that 

1295
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:44,710
and if you could read their mind,
you would.

1296
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:48,950
You would literally be inside the mind 
of a person whose mind isn't functioning

1297
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:52,040
and we can get sort of an understanding 
about what that would be like.

1298
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:52,880
Yeah.
Well,

1299
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:58,330
this has been done in a very simple way.
Where you with schizophrenia who mostly 

1300
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:01,871
have auditory hallucinations,
you can now detect auditory cortex 

1301
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,790
activity,
so mishaps,

1302
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:07,470
misinterpretations.
We just know that they're.

1303
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,300
They're auditory cortices are active in 
the same way that when you're hearing my

1304
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:12,500
voice,
it's going to be active.

1305
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,870
When they're hearing internal voices,
it's active.

1306
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,060
Whoa,
that's crazy.

1307
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,140
Which is what you would expect.

1308
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,560
Maybe be the surprise would be the other
way if it,

1309
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:24,860
if nothing was going on and auditory 
cortex and they were hearing voices,

1310
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:29,861
then wow,
then that would be more surprising to 

1311
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:29,990
me.
That's fascinating.

1312
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:34,991
You can watch the hallucinations take 
place inside the mind of the person and 

1313
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:41,981
you can stimulate hallucinations in 
people you can stimulate out of body 

1314
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:46,601
experiences and people with,
with transcranial magnetic stimulation 

1315
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:46,601
and.
Yeah,

1316
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:51,000
how do they do that?
They've been able to do that recently 

1317
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,260
and to try to give people the same sort 
of experience that they claim to have 

1318
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,240
had when like on the operating table.
That's what people have a lot,

1319
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,410
right?
When they're almost dead.

1320
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:58,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

1321
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,450
What's going on?
What is that?

1322
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,470
Well,
that is,

1323
01:01:01,471 --> 01:01:03,150
um,
uh,

1324
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:08,300
there's an area,
I believe this is the temporal parietal 

1325
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:08,820
junction,
which is sort of like here,

1326
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:14,220
um,
what you're pointing to a lot of time 

1327
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,330
talking to you and not talking to the 
millions.

1328
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,490
Um,
but uh,

1329
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,020
it's um,
you know,

1330
01:01:19,021 --> 01:01:22,010
where the temporal lobe and the parietal
lobes intersect.

1331
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:24,360
Um,
and the,

1332
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:29,361
um,
I think it was first discovered in 

1333
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:32,650
surgery on an epileptic where they,
so are you in,

1334
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:38,150
in any kind of resection of the brain 
where the people are awake because 

1335
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,130
there's no pain sensors in the brain so 
you can,

1336
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:44,140
you can stay awake while you're getting 
brain surgery and they tend to keep you 

1337
01:01:44,191 --> 01:01:47,400
awake if they're going to be removing 
areas of the brain,

1338
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:52,401
you know,
let's say a tumor or the focus of an 

1339
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:52,401
epileptic seizure,
um,

1340
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,770
and they don't want to remove working 
parts,

1341
01:01:55,771 --> 01:01:57,700
especially the language part.

1342
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,730
So,
so they're,

1343
01:01:58,731 --> 01:02:00,750
um,
they're keeping people awake and they're

1344
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:02,850
probing,
uh,

1345
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:08,060
those areas of the cortex to see what 
it's correlated within the person's 

1346
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,830
experience.
So you said there having them talk,

1347
01:02:10,831 --> 01:02:12,240
they're having them answer questions and
they're,

1348
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:17,300
and they're putting a little bit of 
current in that area which would be 

1349
01:02:17,641 --> 01:02:22,070
disruptive of normal.
And you know,

1350
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:27,170
you can see there they're mapping the 
almost entirely mapping language cortex 

1351
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:31,971
when they do this.
But there have been experiences where 

1352
01:02:31,971 --> 01:02:32,580
they,
they,

1353
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:36,090
I'm a neurosurgeon will,
will put a little current in,

1354
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:41,220
in an area near this region of the brain
and people will have this out of body 

1355
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:43,990
experience where they're,
you know,

1356
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,800
up in the corner of the room looking 
down on their bodies or um,

1357
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,130
you know,
the classic,

1358
01:02:50,131 --> 01:02:55,131
you know,
astral projection experience where the 

1359
01:02:55,131 --> 01:02:55,131
or the um,
um,

1360
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,930
the near death experience where,
you know,

1361
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,960
people have,
have risen out of their body or seem to 

1362
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,521
have risen out of their body and 
consciousness now seems to be located 

1363
01:03:04,521 --> 01:03:04,521
elsewhere.

1364
01:03:04,521 --> 01:03:05,800
And that's a,
um,

1365
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,130
uh,
there's just,

1366
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:08,670
uh,
the,

1367
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,330
the,
that region of the brain is,

1368
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,490
um,
I mean,

1369
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,170
virtually every region of the cortex 
does many,

1370
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,070
many things.
There's no,

1371
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:22,340
there's no one region of the brain that 
does one thing.

1372
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:23,940
You know,
there's a couple of exceptions to this,

1373
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,190
but the,
um,

1374
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,770
uh,
so the burden,

1375
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,800
the whole brain is participating in,
in much of what we do and it's just a 

1376
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,180
greater or lesser degrees of activity.
But in terms of your,

1377
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:37,440
your mapping,
your body in space,

1378
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:38,730
this is,
you know,

1379
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:43,731
the parietal lobe is,
has got a lot to do with that and when 

1380
01:03:43,731 --> 01:03:47,430
that gets disturbed,
you can have weird experiences.

1381
01:03:47,431 --> 01:03:52,431
You can have the experience of,
I'm not recognizing your body or parts 

1382
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:53,500
of your body.
You're like,

1383
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:53,820
you,
like,

1384
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:57,780
you don't really like Alien Hand 
Syndrome where you'd like your left arm.

1385
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:01,920
Uh,
seems seems like another person's arm,

1386
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:02,950
you know,
and people,

1387
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,040
you know,
try to disown half their body.

1388
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,860
Um,
and uh,

1389
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,890
you can trick people with visual,
um,

1390
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:15,340
uh,
changes of display like you can,

1391
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:19,780
you can wear headgear where you can make
me feel like it's like a,

1392
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:23,850
it's called the body swapping illusion.
I can feel like I am located.

1393
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:26,460
My consciousness is located in your 
body.

1394
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,070
Looking back at me,
there's a,

1395
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:31,230
there's a clever experiment that they 
did where,

1396
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:36,610
um,
that is the ultimate extension of what 

1397
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:39,030
has long been called the rubber hand 
illusion where you can,

1398
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,310
you can put like my two hands are on the
table.

1399
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:46,311
Now you can set up an experiment where 
if you put a rubber hand,

1400
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,620
um,
if,

1401
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,670
if you,
if you set this up in a way where I am,

1402
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,640
I am assuming I have my two hands here.
Um,

1403
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,070
you can,
uh,

1404
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,190
you can put a rubber hand in its place 
and um,

1405
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,230
touch,
touch this rubber hand with it,

1406
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,470
with a brush,
right?

1407
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,910
So,
so the,

1408
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:07,110
so I'm seeing the rubber hand get 
touched.

1409
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:12,111
W W with a brush and I'm a,
I can feel like my hand is being 

1410
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:18,951
touched.
Like it's like if my hand is being 

1411
01:05:18,951 --> 01:05:20,451
touched,
my hand is elsewhere under the table 

1412
01:05:20,451 --> 01:05:20,451
being touched with a brush at the same 
time.

1413
01:05:20,451 --> 01:05:23,170
I can feel like my hand is now the 
rubber hand,

1414
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:23,630
right?
I could,

1415
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,680
so I can feel like my hand is in place 
of the rubber hand based on visual and 

1416
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:31,110
tactile.
Um,

1417
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:33,310
you know,
the simultaneity of my scene,

1418
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:35,890
the rubber hand get touched with a brush
and my feeling my hand,

1419
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,750
which is now under the table being 
touched with the brush.

1420
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,350
I'm,
I'm not explaining that setup great,

1421
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,530
but people can look it up.
But you can do the same thing to a,

1422
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:50,070
to the ultimate degree with this video 
goggles display where I'm getting input,

1423
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,250
visual input from where you're standing.

1424
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,950
So like if you come up to shake my hand,
right,

1425
01:05:57,310 --> 01:06:02,310
I'm,
I'm seeing you come up to me and shake 

1426
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:04,741
my hand,
but I'm seeing it from your point of 

1427
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:04,741
view,
right?

1428
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:04,741
So like I'm getting,
you know,

1429
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:04,990
visual input from,
from,

1430
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:10,030
you know,
I now feel like I'm walking up to me 

1431
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,481
shaking my hand and you can,
you can just kind of feel like you are 

1432
01:06:12,481 --> 01:06:14,210
consciousness is,
is out,

1433
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,910
is over there,
you know,

1434
01:06:15,911 --> 01:06:17,850
outside your body.
Um,

1435
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,590
and it's just to say that,
that our,

1436
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:26,100
our sense of self,
our sense of being located where we are 

1437
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,700
in our heads is largely a,
and in some cases almost entirely a 

1438
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:34,630
matter of a vision,
right?

1439
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:37,570
It's a matter of fact.
The fact that you feel you're over there

1440
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:38,590
is because you're,
I mean,

1441
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:40,540
that's where your eyes are here.
You're behind your eyes.

1442
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:44,530
You feel like you're behind your eyes.
And when you and tricks of a vision can,

1443
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,540
can,
uh,

1444
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,400
seem to dislodge,
um,

1445
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,040
that's that sense of being located 
there.

1446
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,920
So stimulating one area of the brain 
electrically has been shown,

1447
01:06:57,411 --> 01:06:59,180
like even just transdermally,
just the,

1448
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,440
I guess,
what do they do?

1449
01:07:00,441 --> 01:07:02,030
They put little,
little,

1450
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:04,340
what are those things called?
Those little glue on things.

1451
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,770
Electrodes.
And they can.

1452
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,810
You're talking about eeg.
They're reading from the brain,

1453
01:07:10,811 --> 01:07:10,960
right?

1454
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:16,120
No,
I'm actually talking about some new 

1455
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,450
experiments that they've been doing that
they were talking about on radio lab.

1456
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,720
And apparently there's a bunch of,
do it yourselfers that or if you ever 

1457
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,100
listened to radio lab.
Amazing Awhile.

1458
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:28,180
But yeah,
amazing podcasts like one of the best 

1459
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:30,041
our.
But it has this one episode that dealt 

1460
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:33,401
with people learning certain skills 
while the outside of their brain is 

1461
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:34,340
being stimulated with like a little 
electrode.

1462
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:40,030
And this woman who was one of the 
reporters went to a sniper training 

1463
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:45,041
thing where they set up the scenario and
they give you like a fake gun and you 

1464
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:45,080
pointed the screen.
He tried to hit the targets as all these

1465
01:07:45,081 --> 01:07:46,560
things are happening.
Uh,

1466
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,750
she did it once.
Yeah.

1467
01:07:47,751 --> 01:07:49,850
Nine Volt Nirvana is the name of the 
episode.

1468
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:50,090
Right,
right.

1469
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,840
It is an outstanding episode.
It's so fascinating.

1470
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:55,070
Anyway,
she goes through one.

1471
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,440
She's terrible at it.
She just sucks terribly.

1472
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:02,740
Then they hook her up to this machine.
They attached this electrode to a 

1473
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,821
certain certain area of her brain,
stimulate one area of her brain and she 

1474
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:08,360
goes through it like a fucking sniper 
time,

1475
01:08:08,361 --> 01:08:10,550
slows down.
She gets 20 out of 20.

1476
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:16,030
So she goes from being a complete 
failure to being awesome at it and some 

1477
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:16,030
weird state

1478
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:20,980
that she described and they're talking 
about of the US government's using it 

1479
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,671
and they're trying to train soldiers and
snipers and people to try to understand 

1480
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:29,411
this mindset and try to achieve this 
mindset and that they're trying to do 

1481
01:08:29,411 --> 01:08:32,801
it.
And there's certain companies that are 

1482
01:08:32,801 --> 01:08:33,110
experimenting with it at least by 
stimulating the outside of your head.

1483
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:38,760
Was it.
So I could not know this particular 

1484
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:38,760
story.
I remember hearing that title though,

1485
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,691
but the transcranial magnetic 
stimulation is magnetic energy,

1486
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,160
which is,
you know,

1487
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,860
the,
the flip side of electrical energy.

1488
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:51,860
So if you apply a big magnet to the side
of your head,

1489
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:56,060
you are changing the electrical 
properties of your cortex.

1490
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,500
Is that what they're doing?
Well,

1491
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:57,850
no,
I'm,

1492
01:08:57,851 --> 01:09:02,851
I'm wondering if they've just made a 
transcranial magnetic device so small 

1493
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,640
that it's,
that it's um,

1494
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,760
I don't think it's Magneto is direct.
Current.

1495
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,360
Yeah.
Well,

1496
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:09,050
yeah.
Okay.

1497
01:09:09,051 --> 01:09:12,260
Direct current stimulation.
Transcranial direct current stimulation.

1498
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:13,370
Yeah,
that's what it's called.

1499
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,480
TCD will say.
Yeah,

1500
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,290
I'm unaware of the specifics of this,
but it's,

1501
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,210
it's been true for a long time that 
with,

1502
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,750
with,
with um,

1503
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:27,190
a much bigger device in a lab,
you can change a person's performance 

1504
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:30,880
for good or for ill on,
on various tasks just by and,

1505
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:35,910
and it's just an electromagnet which is 
focusing its energy on various areas of 

1506
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,470
the cortex.
So bizarre.

1507
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,210
Yeah.
Because what we're doing,

1508
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,360
I mean you are,
you are disrupting a neural firing,

1509
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:52,330
but your,
you can disrupt areas that are 

1510
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:54,470
inhibiting other things you want to 
release.

1511
01:09:54,471 --> 01:09:56,210
So it's,
it can be,

1512
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,480
it's not always synonymous with the 
degradation of performance mean you 

1513
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,681
could,
you could increase performance on a 

1514
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:08,021
certain task by taking one region of the
brain offline are more or less offline.

1515
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,810
Um,
but I'm not,

1516
01:10:11,811 --> 01:10:16,811
you know,
I'm not aware of how far they've taken 

1517
01:10:16,811 --> 01:10:18,340
it in terms of doing anything that seems
useful in terms of performing something.

1518
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:23,350
I mean what the research I'm more aware 
of is just using this to figure out what

1519
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:28,990
various regions of the brain are doing.
I mean I a mapping function because you 

1520
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:31,340
want to see if I disrupt area and area 
here,

1521
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:36,790
what,
how does that show up in an experiment 

1522
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:38,330
and that gives you some clue as to as to
what that region is doing,

1523
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:43,390
at least in that task.
As much as we know about the mind and 

1524
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:43,390
being able to do things like this.
Like overall,

1525
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:48,341
if you had a really like trying to map 
out the exact functions of the mind and 

1526
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:52,181
how everything works,
how far do you think we are along the 

1527
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:55,151
understanding that we halfway to think 
we understand half of how the brain 

1528
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:55,151
works.

1529
01:10:55,950 --> 01:11:00,950
Not what I mean,
I wouldn't even know how to quantify it 

1530
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:03,560
at this point.
It's just we know a ton,

1531
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:08,740
right.
And we know how we know a lot about 

1532
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:09,710
where languages and where facial 
recognition is.

1533
01:11:09,711 --> 01:11:11,030
And so your,
your,

1534
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:15,270
your visual cortex been really well 
mapped and um,

1535
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:21,070
uh,
we know a lot and the last 150 years 

1536
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:23,890
based on just the neurological injury 
and,

1537
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,290
and then in the last,
uh,

1538
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,640
decades based on imaging technology,
we know regions of the brain that,

1539
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:35,190
you know,
absolutely governed language and regions

1540
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:38,280
of the brain that have basically nothing
to do with language,

1541
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:39,390
you know,
to take one example,

1542
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,070
um,
and we know a lot about memory and we,

1543
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,730
we know about a lot about the different 
kinds of memory,

1544
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:48,090
uh,
but it's um,

1545
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:50,100
there's,
you know,

1546
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,780
I think there's probably,
there's much more.

1547
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:56,781
We don't know what's even more um,
because I kind of the greatest friction 

1548
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:01,020
in the system.

1549
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,830
There's not often a lot to do with what 
we know.

1550
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:05,580
Right.
So like the,

1551
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,740
like knowing is not enough for certain 
things.

1552
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:12,741
It's not because he tried to intervene 
is another part of the process,

1553
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:15,730
which where there are no guarantees,
I mean the,

1554
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:16,140
the,
the,

1555
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:21,141
the way we can intervene in the 
functioning of the brain is incredibly 

1556
01:12:21,141 --> 01:12:21,640
crude,
you know,

1557
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:25,500
pharmacologically or with surgery or 
with a device like that.

1558
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,170
Um,
so to get,

1559
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:33,710
to get from a place of really refined 
knowledge to a place of being able to do

1560
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:36,690
something we want to do with that 
knowledge,

1561
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,350
that's another step.
And that's,

1562
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:39,960
that's a step that is,
um,

1563
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,160
you know,
I,

1564
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:46,161
I,
there's no reason to think that we're 

1565
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:46,161
not going to take it at some point,
but it's an additional complexity to get

1566
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,930
inside the head safely and help people,
you know,

1567
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,370
or improve function.

1568
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,500
Um,
uh,

1569
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,670
even if you know a lot about what you 
know,

1570
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:57,180
those areas of the brain do,
but we don't,

1571
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:00,870
we don't know.
We haven't cracked the neural code.

1572
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:05,871
We don't know.
We don't know how consciousness is 

1573
01:13:05,871 --> 01:13:05,871
arising in the brain.
Um,

1574
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:09,630
we wouldn't know how to build a,
a,

1575
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:15,200
a computer that does what we do to say 
nothing of experience the world as we 

1576
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:20,160
experience it yet.
And um,

1577
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:25,820
and we may be going down paths where we 
will build it more by happenstance,

1578
01:13:26,221 --> 01:13:27,500
whereas like we will,
we,

1579
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:30,780
when we build it and not quite know how 
it's doing,

1580
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:35,781
what it's doing,
but it seeming to do more or less what 

1581
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:36,360
we do,
I would be doing it very differently.

1582
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,960
I mean,
so the,

1583
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:42,010
there are two paths are at least two 
distinct paths in artificial 

1584
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:46,521
intelligence and one path could take a,
could try to emulate what the brain is 

1585
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:50,670
doing and that obviously requires a real
detailed understanding of what the brain

1586
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:51,060
is doing.

1587
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:54,840
Another path would be to just ignore the
brain,

1588
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:59,990
right?
So like there's no reason why 

1589
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,330
artificially intelligent machines,
even machines that are super human in 

1590
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:06,890
their capacities need to do anything,
uh,

1591
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,410
that is similar to what we do with our 
brains.

1592
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:11,950
You know,
it wouldn't,

1593
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:13,510
you know,
neurochemical circus,

1594
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,980
so because they're going to be organized
differently and um,

1595
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,200
you know,
could be organized quite differently and

1596
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,480
obviously made of totally different 
stuff.

1597
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:27,930
Um,
so whether you want to go down the path 

1598
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:31,621
of emulating the brain on the basis of 
have a detailed understanding of it or 

1599
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:36,751
you just want to go down the path of 
maximizing intelligent behavior in 

1600
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,390
machines or some combination of the two,
they're there.

1601
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,550
They're not necessarily,
they're,

1602
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,950
they're distinct and,
and,

1603
01:14:45,951 --> 01:14:50,951
um,
one doesn't entail really knowing that 

1604
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:54,090
much about the brain necessarily.
So there's really two different ways 

1605
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:54,090
they can go about it.

1606
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,180
Either they could try to reproduce a 
brain,

1607
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:57,150
which people are,
they can make.

1608
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,430
Yeah,
I mean,

1609
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,060
if they can make fake meat,
why can't they make fake brain tissue?

1610
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,430
It seems like they could.
I mean,

1611
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:06,340
I know a woman got her bladder replaced 
with stem cells.

1612
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:11,341
Did you hear about that?
They took stem cells and recreated her 

1613
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:12,310
own bladder in a,
she had a bladder cancer,

1614
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:17,680
so they built her a new bladder and a 
laboratory and put her own ladder back 

1615
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,980
in her body.
That is sanely fascinating.

1616
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:25,981
Now,
if they can figure out how to extract a 

1617
01:15:25,981 --> 01:15:27,751
little bit of brain tissue thing is that
the brain is famously the most 

1618
01:15:27,751 --> 01:15:31,750
complicated object in the universe.
A bladder is essentially a bag,

1619
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,810
you know,
so it's a big leap.

1620
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:36,940
It's a big leap,
but it's not,

1621
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,300
um,
you know,

1622
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,980
I think it's a leap we will take and you
know,

1623
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:46,981
whether we take,
whether the May maybe a leap we take in 

1624
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:51,810
this step wise way where we build 
machines down a path that is not at all 

1625
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:57,331
analogous to recreating brains,
which allow us to then understand the 

1626
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,350
brain,
you know,

1627
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:00,190
totally.

1628
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,600
I'm in,
in the,

1629
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:07,340
uh,
in the Ray Kurtzweil sentence where we 

1630
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:07,600
can upload ourselves,
if that makes any sense.

1631
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,180
Um,
but it's a uh,

1632
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,470
uh,
I,

1633
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:18,550
I think,
I think information processing is at 

1634
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:23,060
bottom what intelligence is,
I think that is,

1635
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,790
that is not really up for dispute at 
this point that any,

1636
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:32,791
any intelligence system is processing 
information and our brains are doing 

1637
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:33,850
that.
Um,

1638
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:39,150
and any machine that is going to exhibit
the kind of general intelligence that we

1639
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:45,870
exhibit a and surpass us,
we'll be doing by dent of its hardware 

1640
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:52,441
and software.
Something deeply analogous to what our 

1641
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:52,441
brains are doing.
But again,

1642
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,140
it may not,
we may not get there based on,

1643
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:01,700
um,
directly emulating what our brains are 

1644
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,230
doing and we may get there before we 
actually understand,

1645
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,770
understand our brains in a way that 
would allow us to emulate it.

1646
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,070
It's always very interesting

1647
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,930
to me how it seems to be.
There's always a pushes and pulls in,

1648
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:19,931
in life and when you have things that 
are as horrific as factory farming and 

1649
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:25,901
people are exposed to it,
then there's this rebound and where 

1650
01:17:25,901 --> 01:17:29,201
people were trying to find a solution.
And I always wonder like if will that be

1651
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:31,880
the first artificial life that we 
create?

1652
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:34,340
Like Zombie cows,
like some made,

1653
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:39,341
if we've figured out that meat in the 
lab is not good because it has to 

1654
01:17:39,341 --> 01:17:39,440
actually be moving around for it to be 
good for you.

1655
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:42,260
Maybe maybe they'll come up with some 
idea to just look,

1656
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:47,261
we're going to make zombies were going 
to make livestock that essentially can 

1657
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:50,600
just move forward and consume food.
There's no thought whatsoever.

1658
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:55,780
These are zombies.
You can go right up to him and you wave 

1659
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:55,780
your hand in front of them.
They don't even move.

1660
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,700
Is it okay to kill those and then go 
from that to making artificial people?

1661
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:01,250
Because it seems to me that artificial 
people,

1662
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:06,750
it's going gonna happen.
I mean it's just a matter of how much 

1663
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,551
time,
if they're making bladders and then 

1664
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,351
they're going to start making all sorts 
of different tissues with stem cells to 

1665
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:12,070
try to replace body parts in Oregon's 
and they're,

1666
01:18:12,071 --> 01:18:17,071
they're gonna,
they're gonna work their way through an 

1667
01:18:17,071 --> 01:18:17,071
actual human body.
It's going to happen.

1668
01:18:17,071 --> 01:18:17,450
What do you mean?
You mean a,

1669
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,600
a brainless person that would be like 
spare parts for,

1670
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,430
for you?
For sure.

1671
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:26,390
That's an option,
but I think also an artificial human,

1672
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,290
I mean might take a thousand years,
but I think if we stay alive,

1673
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:35,320
if human beings rather,
if human beings continue to evolve 

1674
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,380
technologically within the next hundred 
years,

1675
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:39,920
we're going to have artificial people 
that are completely see that people.

1676
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:42,060
So we're going to build a biological 
person,

1677
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:47,090
hundred percent.
So it's that sense that synthesize 

1678
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:47,090
synthesized person,
right?

1679
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:47,090
So it's not,
we're not,

1680
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:47,540
you're not talking about the perfect 
robot.

1681
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:51,620
You're talking about an actual person 
built up cell by cell,

1682
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,730
yet you know,
there's no,

1683
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,970
there's no reason why that's not 
possible.

1684
01:18:58,971 --> 01:19:02,180
And whether or not we would do it is,
is another question.

1685
01:19:02,181 --> 01:19:02,450
But yeah,

1686
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:07,510
I had a,
I had this somebody would China where 

1687
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,510
you're.
Yeah,

1688
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,570
well presumably there are limits.
Even in China,

1689
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:12,260
they do an experience.
There's already with human embryos.

1690
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,090
I don't know what they're doing in 
China.

1691
01:19:14,091 --> 01:19:16,610
I believe they are.
I believe they got the goal to have that

1692
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:21,611
dog festival every year.
I see people tweet about China's a big 

1693
01:19:21,611 --> 01:19:22,130
place though,
can't remember them all in there,

1694
01:19:22,131 --> 01:19:23,210
but you know,
um,

1695
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:25,970
uh,
what does that gene splicing software,

1696
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:30,971
Chris Perrysburg to using crisper on a 
human fetuses or human embryos.

1697
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,110
Right?
So good luck,

1698
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,520
good luck world.
Well,

1699
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:38,540
so China is creating super athletes.
There are many issues there.

1700
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:44,270
Mean.
So when you're talking about a changing 

1701
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:48,210
the genome and you,
especially when you're talking about 

1702
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:48,210
changing the germ line,
you know,

1703
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,730
and then it gets passed onto future 
generations that,

1704
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:52,520
that has big implications.
But um,

1705
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,790
you know,
I don't see why,

1706
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:59,850
I mean this goes to,
it's like the artificial meat 

1707
01:19:59,850 --> 01:19:59,850
conversation,
so to,

1708
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:04,320
to grow meat in a vat is ethically the 
same thing as,

1709
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:11,670
at least my view.
It'd be the same thing as producing a 

1710
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:11,670
brainless cow,
right?

1711
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:13,230
The,
so you have the whole cow that you could

1712
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:15,070
slaughter,
but it has no brain.

1713
01:20:15,071 --> 01:20:20,071
And so presumably there's no experience 
in this animal,

1714
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,550
but it is the fully functioning animal,
right?

1715
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:26,390
So let's say you could produce that and 
it would be a,

1716
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:30,570
you would produce healthy meat.
It's just a messier.

1717
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,120
Presumably you have to feed this thing,
right?

1718
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:33,870
Um,
or,

1719
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,880
or I don't know how you get it to eat,
but you know,

1720
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,350
you'll say you feed it intravenously.

1721
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:40,290
It all begins to look weirder and 
Weirder,

1722
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:44,040
but there is no suffering there because 
there's no brain.

1723
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,200
Um,
I think we would,

1724
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:51,730
and I think we have decided to bypass 
that vision and just go straight to the 

1725
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:53,700
VAT and just build it up,
sell,

1726
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:54,330
buy,
sell,

1727
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:58,890
and build up only what we need,
which is the meatball or the steak or a.

1728
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:03,910
and so why have the author and the and 
the organs that you don't want and the 

1729
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:05,940
mess,
and I'm the kind of the energy intensive

1730
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:10,941
aspects of,
of producing whole animal and I think 

1731
01:21:10,941 --> 01:21:13,191
with like spare parts for humans rather 
than create a clone of yourself that has

1732
01:21:13,321 --> 01:21:14,770
no brain,
that you just keep in a,

1733
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,520
in a vat somewhere in your garage,
uh,

1734
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:20,550
where you can get spare kidneys when you
need them.

1735
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:25,910
Um,
we would just be able to print the 

1736
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:30,261
kidneys and that is that because that 
gets around a lot of the weirdness,

1737
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:32,370
right?
It'd be weird to have a copy of yourself

1738
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:35,810
that's just a spare parts,
uh,

1739
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,360
whereas it wouldn't be weird or at least
in my view,

1740
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:43,380
wouldn't be weird.
It would be fantastic to be able to go 

1741
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:46,131
into a hospital when your kidneys are 
failing and they just take a cell and 

1742
01:21:46,131 --> 01:21:46,320
print you a new kidney.

1743
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:48,150
Yeah.
Um,

1744
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:51,350
I think that can be expected.
And that's going to.

1745
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:52,820
I mean,
if it's possible,

1746
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:56,750
it seems like it's going in.
The bladder example you just gave is,

1747
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,790
is uh,
what's happening there.

1748
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:03,850
It's amazing.
But I always want to extrapolate things 

1749
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:06,170
to some bizarre place a thousand years 
from now for some reason because,

1750
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:06,530
uh,
I've,

1751
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:07,970
I've been,
you know,

1752
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,690
since I got into Dan Carlin's hardcore 
history,

1753
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:12,970
um,
I've,

1754
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:18,060
it really fucked my mind up about how I 
think about the past in this way that I 

1755
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,770
look like a thousand years ago in 
comparison to today.

1756
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,000
And I,
you know,

1757
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:23,660
I try to think,
well,

1758
01:22:23,661 --> 01:22:26,330
how much different will people be a 
thousand years from now?

1759
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,690
And it probably way more different.
Yeah.

1760
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,020
You know,
I mean the,

1761
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:33,320
the fascination that we have with 
ancient histories that we,

1762
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:35,780
one of the things obviously we want to 
know where we came from,

1763
01:22:35,781 --> 01:22:40,781
but also we can kind of see people today
doing similar shit if they were allowed 

1764
01:22:41,061 --> 01:22:43,400
to.
Like if everything went horribly wrong,

1765
01:22:43,401 --> 01:22:48,401
people at their base level of kind of 
similar today as they were a thousand 

1766
01:22:48,401 --> 01:22:53,110
years from now,
one of them might be running for 

1767
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:53,110
president.
We can talk about that.

1768
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:57,790
And when I think about the future a 
thousand years from now with the way 

1769
01:22:58,731 --> 01:23:03,731
technology is accelerating and the just 
the capacity that we have an ability 

1770
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,400
change,
things

1771
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:11,700
to change the world,
change physical structures to change 

1772
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,941
bodies,
to dig into the ground and extract 

1773
01:23:14,941 --> 01:23:18,630
resources like we're getting better and 
better at changing things and 

1774
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:22,831
manipulating things that extracting 
power from the sun and extracting salt 

1775
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:27,811
from the water.
There's like all this bizarre change 

1776
01:23:27,811 --> 01:23:30,331
technology that's consistently and 
constantly going on with people and it 

1777
01:23:30,331 --> 01:23:34,021
continues to get better when I think 
about a thousand years from now and 

1778
01:23:34,021 --> 01:23:37,261
artificial people and light and this 
concept of being able to read each 

1779
01:23:37,261 --> 01:23:40,771
other's minds and being able to map out 
imagery and pass it back and forth from 

1780
01:23:40,771 --> 01:23:44,090
mind to mind and like a clear 
spreadsheet form like a.

1781
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:45,670
What does that movie with Tom Cruise 
movie.

1782
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,290
Minority report.
Thank you.

1783
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:53,020
Mean that's the way it's on the way.
It's going to be incredibly strange to 

1784
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:53,730
be a person.
Yeah.

1785
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,700
Whether we will be people in a thousand 
years,

1786
01:23:57,701 --> 01:23:59,410
I think you would.

1787
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:05,100
Unless we have done something terrible 
and knocked ourselves back a thousand 

1788
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:05,100
years,
uh,

1789
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:09,610
I think we will decide to change 
ourselves in that time in ways that will

1790
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,240
make us.
And we,

1791
01:24:11,241 --> 01:24:11,920
you know,
they'll be,

1792
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:14,920
there may be many different species.
It's like tattoos,

1793
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:15,340
you know,
you,

1794
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:16,930
you have a bunch of tattoos.
I have none.

1795
01:24:16,931 --> 01:24:21,931
You could take that a lot further if you
can just begin really tinkering with 

1796
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:24,190
everything,
you know?

1797
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:29,460
Oh yeah.
If you want to get nutty and put the 

1798
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:29,460
bolts in your head and shit or just,
just give yourself a,

1799
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:33,230
just fundamentally different genetic,
uh,

1800
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,210
abilities,
right?

1801
01:24:34,211 --> 01:24:39,211
I mean like if you could just go,
you could become a different species if 

1802
01:24:39,211 --> 01:24:39,211
you took it far enough.

1803
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,720
Maybe that's what the aliens are.
Maybe that's why they all look the same.

1804
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,990
Maybe they figured it out like a little.
You got to look alike.

1805
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,200
Otherwise you can't appreciate each 
other.

1806
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,380
When one guy's weird looking,
one guy short,

1807
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:58,381
one guy's got a big nose.
Everybody is so confusing to many 

1808
01:24:58,381 --> 01:25:01,141
people.
I could hate everybody look exactly the 

1809
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:01,141
same.
So the government gets together with all

1810
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:05,521
the people to their planet and they go,
look where we have a problem with this 

1811
01:25:05,521 --> 01:25:05,521
good looking thing.
Bullshits holding us back.

1812
01:25:05,521 --> 01:25:07,120
A lot of people that are stupid,
that getting ahead,

1813
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:10,900
we've got all look the same blank,
emotionless and big giant eyes.

1814
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,620
That's it.
They all just went in with a passion for

1815
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:16,630
molesting cattle,
allegedly.

1816
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:20,680
I think that's people.
People are blaming that on the aliens.

1817
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,500
I had this guy on my podcast,
David Deutsch.

1818
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:24,130
Have you heard of him?

1819
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:25,780
He was a physicist at Oxford.
Yes.

1820
01:25:25,781 --> 01:25:26,950
I have.
Why ever heard of him?

1821
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:32,280
He wrote a book.
He gave it at least one ted talk and 

1822
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:35,110
he's written two very good books.
The first came out about 10 years ago,

1823
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:39,880
the fabric of reality and the more 
recent one is the beginning of infinity.

1824
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:45,190
And I'm extremely smart guy and I'm very
nice guy.

1825
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,020
And He,
um,

1826
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:52,800
he has this thesis which he,
he and I don't totally agree about the 

1827
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,380
implications going forward for ai,
but the,

1828
01:25:56,390 --> 01:26:00,040
um,
he's convinced me that his basic thesis,

1829
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:01,420
which is fascinating,
which is his,

1830
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:02,940
his,
um,

1831
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,040
the role

1832
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:09,040
that knowledge plays in our universe or 
the potential role that it plays and his

1833
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:14,030
argument is that in any corner of the 
universe,

1834
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:20,470
anything that is compatible with the 
laws of physics can be done with the 

1835
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:24,090
requisite knowledge.
So that as,

1836
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:24,400
uh,
his,

1837
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:29,410
his argument about how deep knowledge 
goes and therefore how valuable it is in

1838
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:34,601
the end.
So I'm queuing off your notion of 

1839
01:26:34,601 --> 01:26:35,070
building an artificial person.
I mean literally,

1840
01:26:35,071 --> 01:26:36,140
you know,
sell by salary,

1841
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,550
atom by atom,
if that.

1842
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:44,120
There's every reason to believe that's 
compatible with the laws of physics.

1843
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:44,960
I mean,
we exist,

1844
01:26:44,961 --> 01:26:45,520
right?
So we,

1845
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:49,100
we got built by the happenstance of,
of biology.

1846
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:53,820
Um,
if we had what he calls a,

1847
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,820
a universal constructor,
you know,

1848
01:26:55,821 --> 01:27:00,620
the smallest machine that could assemble
and the other machine atom by atom,

1849
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,570
um,
we could,

1850
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,070
we could build anything.
Adam.

1851
01:27:04,071 --> 01:27:04,850
Bye Adam.
Right?

1852
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:10,210
And um,
so he has this vision of it like you 

1853
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:12,250
could literally go into a,
um,

1854
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:17,680
an area of deep space that is as close 
to a vacuum as possible and you know,

1855
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:22,691
begins sweeping up stray hydrogen atoms 
and fuse them together and generate 

1856
01:27:25,611 --> 01:27:26,840
heavier elements.

1857
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:32,140
I mean literally,
so you could start with nothing but 

1858
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:32,140
hydrogen,
right and,

1859
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:36,130
and bay with the requisite knowledge,
few bit,

1860
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:39,080
build your own little fusion reactor,
create heavier elements,

1861
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:44,410
and based on those elements,
create the smallest machine that can 

1862
01:27:44,691 --> 01:27:47,360
then assemble anything else atom by 
atom,

1863
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:49,400
uh,
including more of itself.

1864
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:54,460
Right?
And you could start this process of 

1865
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,100
building anything from a person to,
you know,

1866
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:59,390
if there's something far more advanced 
than a person to a planet,

1867
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:01,880
but just anything is made of atoms,
right?

1868
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:03,480
Anything is organized and,
and,

1869
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:06,920
and so the,
the limiting factor in,

1870
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,010
in that case is always the knowledge,
right?

1871
01:28:10,011 --> 01:28:12,860
So it's either the eliminating factors,
either the laws of physics,

1872
01:28:12,861 --> 01:28:17,861
either this can't be done because it's 
physically impossible or the knowledge 

1873
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,320
is what you're lacking.
And I'm given that human beings are 

1874
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:27,401
physically impossible.
There should be some knowledge path 

1875
01:28:27,401 --> 01:28:28,310
whereby you could assemble one atom by 
atom,

1876
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:29,150
right?

1877
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:34,150
There's no,
there's no reason why there's no deep 

1878
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:36,971
physical reason why that wouldn't be the
case that the reason is it's we don't 

1879
01:28:36,971 --> 01:28:41,310
know how to do it right.
But presumably a,

1880
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:45,260
it'd be possible for us to,
to acquire that knowledge.

1881
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:49,190
And so the,
the horizon of knowledge is just extends

1882
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:52,100
functionally without limit,
right?

1883
01:28:52,101 --> 01:28:52,620
There's just,
there's,

1884
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:57,620
we were nowhere near the place where we 
know everything that's knowable,

1885
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,090
um,
as,

1886
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:03,270
as witnessed by the fact that we don't 
yet know how to build a,

1887
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,280
a human atom by atom.
Um,

1888
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:11,850
but when you imagine just the changes 
that could occur in our world,

1889
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,110
uh,
w w with,

1890
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,380
with the frontiers of knowledge 
explored,

1891
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:18,360
you know,
10,000

1892
01:29:18,361 --> 01:29:20,450
years beyond where we are now.
I mean,

1893
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:25,460
it would be,
we will be unrecognizable to ourselves 

1894
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,760
and everything would be equivalent to 
magic.

1895
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:27,960
You know,
if we could see it now.

1896
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:32,960
And,
and most of human history is not like 

1897
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,571
that in most of human history.
Have you dropped into any period of 

1898
01:29:35,571 --> 01:29:35,700
human history?
It was,

1899
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:41,570
for all intents and purposes,
identical to the way it was 500 years 

1900
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:45,681
before and 500 years before that.
It's only very recently where you would 

1901
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:49,941
drop in and be surprised by the 
technology and by the culture and by 

1902
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:52,100
the,
the,

1903
01:29:52,101 --> 01:29:55,140
the,
what is being done with language and the

1904
01:29:55,141 --> 01:30:00,141
consequences of,
of a cooperation among apes like 

1905
01:30:00,141 --> 01:30:01,210
ourselves.
And um,

1906
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:06,470
so I think that this is one place where 
someone like Kurtzweil makes a lot of 

1907
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,870
sense.
This is,

1908
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:08,850
this is clearly accelerating,
right?

1909
01:30:08,851 --> 01:30:13,851
And if we,
and if we don't do something 

1910
01:30:13,851 --> 01:30:13,851
catastrophic,
uh,

1911
01:30:13,851 --> 01:30:16,980
to set us back,
this acceleration is,

1912
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:22,760
is the implication is that the future is
going to be far less recognizable than 

1913
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:30,020
it has been in an,
in any other period of human history to 

1914
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:34,610
the idea of creating a little machine 
that you could shoot out into the 

1915
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:34,950
universe and we'll build you a planet.

1916
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:36,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1917
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:41,750
But the planet is a planet.
It's not the planets obviously big and 

1918
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:44,490
the basis for our biosphere and 
everything we care about.

1919
01:30:44,491 --> 01:30:49,491
But the planet is not what's 
complicated.

1920
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:53,820
It's the ecosystem.
It's the life on the planet.

1921
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:56,700
And our own brains being the ultimate 
example of,

1922
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:58,020
of,
of that complexity,

1923
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:04,520
but presumably intelligent systems can 
become much more complex than that,

1924
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,940
right?
There's no reason to think that we are 

1925
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:10,940
near the summit of possible 
intelligence,

1926
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:16,040
a biological or otherwise.
And I'm a,

1927
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,790
yeah,
it's a,

1928
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:19,410
uh,
once you,

1929
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:23,490
once you begin thinking about building 
things atom by atom,

1930
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,030
then then,
then the,

1931
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,650
the future begins to look very weird 
because it's,

1932
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:32,100
and automating that process,
right?

1933
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:34,320
Where you have,
and this is,

1934
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:37,350
this is the promise of nanotechnology,
um,

1935
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:40,920
where you have something,
you tiny machines that can,

1936
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:46,640
can both build more of themselves and 
more of anything else that would be made

1937
01:31:47,261 --> 01:31:52,261
of,
of tiny machines or assemble anything 

1938
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:55,461
atom by atom or treat your own body like
a machine that it is and deal with it 

1939
01:31:55,461 --> 01:31:56,040
atom by atom.

1940
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:58,740
I mean,
that's the possibilities of intervention

1941
01:31:58,741 --> 01:32:02,410
in the human body or,
or then virtually limitless.

1942
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:05,440
Um,
so it's a uh,

1943
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,530
um,
yeah.

1944
01:32:08,531 --> 01:32:08,980
I mean,
that's,

1945
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:14,010
that's where we,
that's where the physical world begins 

1946
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:15,430
to look.
Just totally fungible.

1947
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:20,460
One,
you know when you're not talking about 

1948
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:22,650
surgery where you're cutting into 
someone's head and hoping you know in 

1949
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:26,521
very coarse way,
hoping you're not taking out areas of 

1950
01:32:26,521 --> 01:32:29,401
brain that they need,
but you're talking about actually 

1951
01:32:29,401 --> 01:32:30,910
repairing A.
I mean if you're talking,

1952
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:35,911
if you can,
if you can tinker with Adam's in a way 

1953
01:32:35,911 --> 01:32:38,101
that you understand you,
then you're talking about repairing 

1954
01:32:38,101 --> 01:32:38,101
anything,
you know.

1955
01:32:38,101 --> 01:32:39,150
Then in creating anything.
Yeah,

1956
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:43,420
like literally Dr Manhattan style,
build ice condos on Mars.

1957
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:46,630
I mean you could create art with it.
You could do anything with it.

1958
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:52,470
It would just somehow or another have to
be programmed with whatever pattern you 

1959
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:52,470
were trying to create.

1960
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:55,960
You could,
you could essentially like make an earth

1961
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:59,800
somewhere else with all the biological 
diversity,

1962
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:04,801
water,
even intelligent life that all could be 

1963
01:33:04,801 --> 01:33:05,110
done through some sort of a machine.
Well it is only one day.

1964
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:07,210
It is at bottom.
Again,

1965
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:12,211
just the information.
It's the knowledge of how to organize 

1966
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:17,040
and how to implement it.
So it's like it's analogous to what has 

1967
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:21,301
happened in films now where like an 
animation and film has gotten good 

1968
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,020
suddenly.
Right?

1969
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:24,910
Where you can see like,
like if they can animate,

1970
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:30,130
you know,
waving hair and full and flowing water 

1971
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,680
and it looks pretty damn good at it.
It looked terrible 30 years ago.

1972
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:35,290
Right.
And we just acclimated to look terrible,

1973
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:39,690
but I'm now at you can,
you can really trick the eye.

1974
01:33:39,691 --> 01:33:44,691
You can build up scenes of nature where 
they're not actually using any 

1975
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:48,670
photography of nature to build it up.

1976
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:51,250
It's just,
it's all a confection of,

1977
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:53,050
of ones and zeroes.
Right.

1978
01:33:53,051 --> 01:33:53,770
They've just,
they've just,

1979
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,740
they've just built it in,
in software like the revenant.

1980
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,200
Perfect example,
that giant bear,

1981
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,240
the attack Leonardo Dicaprio.
See,

1982
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,220
I don't know how that was done,
but I mean,

1983
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:03,880
I,
I,

1984
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,760
I had heard that that was all just pure 
CGI.

1985
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:11,761
Right.
Then when there was a dude in a costume 

1986
01:34:11,761 --> 01:34:11,761
that acted it out with them.
But,

1987
01:34:11,761 --> 01:34:11,860
uh,
essentially it was just all CGI.

1988
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:13,380
Yeah.
Um,

1989
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,290
yeah.
So that,

1990
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:17,380
so that the fact that that's beginning 
to look good,

1991
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:18,100
that's just,
I mean,

1992
01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:19,990
obviously that's just all surface that 
doesn't,

1993
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:23,300
has no implication for the um,
you know,

1994
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:28,330
building a rendering of a bear on film 
is not the same thing as building a 

1995
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:32,671
bear,
but the fact that we can move so far 

1996
01:34:32,671 --> 01:34:36,271
into a building,
I'm modeling that kind of complexity 

1997
01:34:37,451 --> 01:34:41,600
visually.
Just imagine what a superintelligent,

1998
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:47,140
um,
mind could do with a thousand years to,

1999
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,310
to work at it.
Right?

2000
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:51,250
And that's,
and that's we're on the cusp of.

2001
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:52,850
And when I say cuss,
you know,

2002
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:57,870
I don't mean five years,
but let's say a century we're on the 

2003
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:58,130
cusp of a producing the kind

2004
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:03,130
of technology that will allow for that.
And if we put it into perspective 

2005
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:06,460
photography,
I don't believe was even invented until 

2006
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,551
the early 18 hundreds when it was first.
It says sounds about photographs of 

2007
01:35:10,131 --> 01:35:11,090
Lincoln.
There are though.

2008
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:16,180
Yeah.
So was that the early 18 hundreds when 

2009
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,551
he was killed?
I'm 18,

2010
01:35:18,651 --> 01:35:19,620
sixties,
five,

2011
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:20,390
10,
65.

2012
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:24,130
So somewhere after that or somewhere 
before the other,

2013
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:29,230
they invented photography.
So essentially give or take 10 years,

2014
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:34,130
200 years ago.
That's really amazing.

2015
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:39,150
Oh yeah.
If you stop thinking about the revenue 

2016
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,020
from 200 years ago,
we couldn't figure out how to get sound 

2017
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:43,721
in our movies until that 100 years ago.
That thought right there just actually 

2018
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:47,210
just freaked me out with a 200 year 
thought.

2019
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:52,420
Like how little 200 years is the hmong 
gold days and now 200 years ago they 

2020
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:56,981
didn't even have cameras and now they do
and now they have this insane ability to

2021
01:35:58,221 --> 01:36:03,221
recreate things like game of thrones,
wolves and dragons and she's riding 

2022
01:36:03,221 --> 01:36:03,380
around on dragon.
I'm like,

2023
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:08,800
it looks like she's on a dragon.
It doesn't look like old school King 

2024
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:08,800
Kong movies,
you know,

2025
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,800
you ever tried to watch those videos in.
There are some pleasure in that.

2026
01:36:13,341 --> 01:36:18,341
There are awesome.
They're awesome too to to just get into 

2027
01:36:18,341 --> 01:36:18,920
for fun.
But as far as like visual effects,

2028
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:23,921
what they can do now.
And the idea that it's all been done 

2029
01:36:23,921 --> 01:36:26,030
over 200 years is just spectacular.
Not just capturing the image,

2030
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:29,330
but then recreating an artificial 
version and projecting it,

2031
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:30,320
which is,
you know,

2032
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,110
a thousand times more difficult.
And there's

2033
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:38,510
the other feature here of the 
compounding power of knowledge and 

2034
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:43,680
technology were you.
There are certain gains that are truly 

2035
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:46,620
incremental,
whereas just everything is hard.

2036
01:36:46,621 --> 01:36:51,621
Won.
Everything is just one percent better 

2037
01:36:51,621 --> 01:36:53,430
than its predecessor,
but then there are other gains that,

2038
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:58,490
where it's just,
you have created an ability that takes 

2039
01:36:58,490 --> 01:37:02,601
you,
it seems like a kind of quantum leap 

2040
01:37:02,601 --> 01:37:06,380
beyond where you were and uh,
where you go from just fundamentally not

2041
01:37:06,631 --> 01:37:09,870
being able to,
to do anything in that domain.

2042
01:37:09,871 --> 01:37:11,990
And then all of a sudden the domain 
opens up totally.

2043
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,370
So know flight is an example,
right?

2044
01:37:14,371 --> 01:37:19,371
So for the longest time people couldn't 
fly and it was obvious that you can't 

2045
01:37:20,161 --> 01:37:22,620
fly or you're heavier than air and 
you're not,

2046
01:37:22,621 --> 01:37:27,621
you don't have feathers and you're not.
There's no way to flap your arms fast 

2047
01:37:27,621 --> 01:37:29,640
enough.
We're never going to fly.

2048
01:37:29,641 --> 01:37:34,641
Right?
And then at a certain point flight as 

2049
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:36,180
possible and opens this whole domain of 
innovation.

2050
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:41,590
Uh,
but the difference between not being 

2051
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:41,590
able to flow in,
there's no,

2052
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:42,630
there's no progress you can make on the 
ground that it doesn't,

2053
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:44,120
doesn't,
uh,

2054
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:46,620
uh,
avail itself of the,

2055
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:51,700
uh,
the principles of flight as we now know 

2056
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:52,290
them that's going to get you closer.
You know,

2057
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:54,420
you can't jump a little bit higher and 
it's just not.

2058
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:59,750
And so there's,
it doesn't matter what you do with your 

2059
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,750
shoes.
Uh,

2060
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,490
so there,
there are,

2061
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:05,870
there are kind of fundamental gains that
opened up a whole dna sequencing is,

2062
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:10,940
is a more recent example where 
understanding and having access to the 

2063
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:14,240
genome and that's you go from,
uh,

2064
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:19,640
the only way to influence the,
your descendants is to basically make a 

2065
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,100
good choice in wife,
right,

2066
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:32,150
or husband to you can just create a new 
species in a test tube if you wanted to 

2067
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:35,790
write and that,
and that's a,

2068
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:39,480
um,
that kind of a compounding power of,

2069
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:40,210
of,
um,

2070
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,780
understanding the way things work.

2071
01:38:42,910 --> 01:38:43,250
Uh,
the,

2072
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,130
you know,
that that's,

2073
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:49,131
I think we're at the beginning of a 
process that could look very,

2074
01:38:49,201 --> 01:38:50,700
very strange very,
very quickly.

2075
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:51,600
And,
um,

2076
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:52,740
you know,
I think,

2077
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:54,840
uh,
you know,

2078
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:56,790
obviously we were both in good and bad 
ways,

2079
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:57,570
but,
um,

2080
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:03,380
there's,
I don't think there's any brake to pull 

2081
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:03,380
on this train.
I even,

2082
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:07,790
knowledge and intelligence are the most 
valuable things we have,

2083
01:39:08,071 --> 01:39:08,700
right?
So we're going to,

2084
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:13,140
we're going to grab more in so far as we
possibly can,

2085
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:18,620
as quickly as we can and the moments of 
us deciding not to know things and not 

2086
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:21,120
to learn how to do things.
I mean,

2087
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:25,350
those are so few and far between as to 
be almost impossible to reference,

2088
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:30,351
right?
I mean that there are moments where 

2089
01:39:30,351 --> 01:39:31,940
people try to pull the brakes and say 
there's the whole conference and I say,

2090
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:33,420
you know,
should we be doing any of this,

2091
01:39:33,421 --> 01:39:34,020
but then,
you know,

2092
01:39:34,021 --> 01:39:36,390
China does it or,
or threatens to do it.

2093
01:39:36,391 --> 01:39:39,960
And um,
we wind up finding some way to do it,

2094
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:42,750
uh,
uh,

2095
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,910
that,
that we consider ethical.

2096
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,650
Um,
so there are things like,

2097
01:39:46,651 --> 01:39:49,200
you know,
germline tinkering that we,

2098
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:53,160
as far as I know don't do and have 
decided for good reason.

2099
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:55,990
We're not doing.
But um,

2100
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:00,360
is that going to stop people from,
from doing this?

2101
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:02,490
I don't,
I don't think there's any way

2102
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:06,420
they're more worried about actual real 
diseases than they are.

2103
01:40:06,421 --> 01:40:11,421
Man Made Diseases.
When we went to the CD CCS at disease 

2104
01:40:11,421 --> 01:40:11,610
control,
CDC,

2105
01:40:11,611 --> 01:40:14,610
CDC in Galveston,
I guess that's what it is.

2106
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:19,780
It gets the name of the organization,
but it's a building where they housed 

2107
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:22,830
some of the most horrendous viruses and 
diseases known demand.

2108
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:26,880
Like they had anthrax in the CDC has,
has a lot of that.

2109
01:40:26,881 --> 01:40:27,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

2110
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:32,410
And they have these crazy walls like 
thick thick walls and vacuums in the 

2111
01:40:32,410 --> 01:40:36,351
ceilings and everyone's wearing suits 
and they wanted us get in the suits and 

2112
01:40:36,351 --> 01:40:36,351
I went,
fuck you.

2113
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:41,430
There's no way I'm going in that room.
You did this for one of your shows for a

2114
01:40:41,431 --> 01:40:45,060
TV show with Duncan Trussell,
the questions,

2115
01:40:45,061 --> 01:40:49,080
everything show because we were talking 
about weaponized diseases.

2116
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:51,630
And the CDC was like,
forget all that.

2117
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:55,270
Like the real diseases that are 
constantly morphing.

2118
01:40:55,270 --> 01:41:00,270
We have to stay on top of like,
that's what we should be terrified of 

2119
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:03,180
actual real diseases.
Like no one's shown any ability to 

2120
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:04,840
create this stuff that's more fucked up 
than what we already have,

2121
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:08,470
but weaponized anthrax and things along 
those lines.

2122
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:13,471
Like these Russian guys we talked to,
they were talking about how they had 

2123
01:41:13,471 --> 01:41:17,221
vats of this stuff.
They had all kinds of crazy diseases 

2124
01:41:17,221 --> 01:41:21,870
that they had created just in case we 
had gotten into some insane mutually 

2125
01:41:22,271 --> 01:41:24,220
assured destruction,
you know,

2126
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:27,910
a disease spreading thing like they were
down for that.

2127
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:28,540
They were like,
well,

2128
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:31,030
we have to be prepared in case to the 
United States.

2129
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:32,800
Does that.
Whoa,

2130
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:38,070
but what their concern is the center for
Disease Control's guys that they were 

2131
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:38,710
concerned with.
Things like Ebola,

2132
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:41,170
things morphing things becoming 
airborne,

2133
01:41:41,171 --> 01:41:46,171
natural things,
new strains of the flu that become 

2134
01:41:46,171 --> 01:41:46,780
impossible.
Murcia mercy as a terrifying one.

2135
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:49,510
Mercy is one that has a lot of people 
scared.

2136
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:50,650
A lot of doctors.
Scared.

2137
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:52,780
Yeah.
It's a medication resistant.

2138
01:41:52,781 --> 01:41:55,870
Staph infection that's kills people.
I mean,

2139
01:41:55,871 --> 01:42:00,871
it can.
It can absolutely kill people if you 

2140
01:42:00,871 --> 01:42:02,620
don't jump on it quick and take the most
potent antibiotics we have and even then

2141
01:42:02,621 --> 01:42:03,610
it takes a long time.

2142
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:04,780
Yeah,
yeah.

2143
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:06,100
Well,
it's a,

2144
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,680
um,
I actually just tweeted this recently,

2145
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:11,920
I think I said well with some 
billionaire with some,

2146
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:17,340
you know,
zero point one percent or develop some 

2147
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,281
new antibiotics because clearly the 
government and the market can't figure 

2148
01:42:20,281 --> 01:42:23,581
out how to do it and it really is,
it's falling through the cracks in the 

2149
01:42:23,581 --> 01:42:27,190
government market paradigm where it's 
like either the government will do it or

2150
01:42:27,191 --> 01:42:32,191
the market will do it,
but neither are doing it because the 

2151
01:42:32,191 --> 01:42:35,041
market can't.
Bill can't generate the rationale for 

2152
01:42:35,041 --> 01:42:39,871
developing antibiotics because it's so 
costly and you take them,

2153
01:42:39,881 --> 01:42:41,470
you know,
what you take with any luck,

2154
01:42:41,471 --> 01:42:42,160
you take them,
you know,

2155
01:42:42,161 --> 01:42:44,770
once every 10 years for 10 days.
And that's it.

2156
01:42:44,771 --> 01:42:45,180
I mean,
it's not,

2157
01:42:45,181 --> 01:42:50,181
it's not like Viagra or any of the 
antidepressant or any drug that you're 

2158
01:42:50,181 --> 01:42:53,530
going to take regularly for the rest of 
your life.

2159
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:58,560
And um,
so there's no real market incentive to 

2160
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,590
do it.
And,

2161
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:04,591
or at least not enough of one to spend a
billion dollars developing an 

2162
01:43:04,591 --> 01:43:07,351
antibiotic.
And the government apparently is not 

2163
01:43:07,351 --> 01:43:07,870
doing it.
And we're running out of antibiotics.

2164
01:43:07,871 --> 01:43:09,910
And this has been in the news a lot 
recently,

2165
01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:15,170
but we're close to being in a world 
where it's as though we don't have 

2166
01:43:15,431 --> 01:43:16,670
antibiotics,
we're,

2167
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:18,460
we're,
we're a superbug away from,

2168
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,510
from being in that world and

2169
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:23,370
freaking me out.
Sam Harris.

2170
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,860
Oh,
I get freaked out.

2171
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,060
So it's super bugs are the big concern,
right?

2172
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:33,550
Do you think about that in Jujitsu?
Do I've gotten staff right?

2173
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:39,050
My friend Ari had it and we were playing
pool and he was limping and I go,

2174
01:43:39,051 --> 01:43:40,040
what's going on with your leg?
Man?

2175
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:41,390
He goes,
I got a spider bite.

2176
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:42,260
I go,
let me say.

2177
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:44,510
It pulls up his pants.
You've got staff,

2178
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:49,810
you've got to get a doctor.
And he hasn't even done Jujitsu and 

2179
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:53,710
years and I think he got staff again and
I think it's one of those things where 

2180
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:58,301
once I guess everyone has it on their 
body and when you get an infection then 

2181
01:43:58,301 --> 01:44:02,570
it spreads and grows and apparently it 
can be a reoccurring thing.

2182
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:07,930
So people who get it,
particularly Murcia apparently they can 

2183
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:09,410
get it again and it can,
it can get pretty bad.

2184
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:12,800
There was that one fighter who just 
died,

2185
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:16,460
I don't think related to that,
but he had these.

2186
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:17,940
Kevin randleman random.
Yeah,

2187
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:18,490
yeah,
yeah.

2188
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:20,270
Had the men.
He was that.

2189
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:21,110
That was mercer,
right?

2190
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,490
A 100 percent.
Yeah.

2191
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:24,020
Yeah.
He was in the hospital.

2192
01:44:24,021 --> 01:44:26,350
What was it was staff.
I don't know if it was mercy,

2193
01:44:26,351 --> 01:44:29,390
it could have been just staff that he 
ignored for long periods of time,

2194
01:44:29,391 --> 01:44:33,350
but it was 100 percent staff and he 
died.

2195
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:36,770
I don't know what exactly was the cause 
of his death,

2196
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:39,290
but I can't think that that helped him 
any.

2197
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:43,700
I mean he had gotten so bad that it had 
eaten through his body.

2198
01:44:43,701 --> 01:44:48,701
If you,
if you're interested in us for people 

2199
01:44:48,701 --> 01:44:48,701
online that are listening,
Google,

2200
01:44:48,701 --> 01:44:53,681
Kevin Randleman staph infection and 
these are horrific photos that look 

2201
01:44:53,751 --> 01:44:55,940
like,
like something took a bite out of him,

2202
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:57,830
like his under his arm pit.

2203
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:02,860
There's,
I mean I'm like a fist sized chunk of 

2204
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:03,260
meat was missing.
Yeah.

2205
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,670
Yeah.
It's really,

2206
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:06,280
really scary stuff.
Um,

2207
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,400
so yeah,
skin infection.

2208
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:12,401
There it is right there.
You could take a good look deep in see 

2209
01:45:12,401 --> 01:45:13,220
his muscle tissue.
That is hardcore,

2210
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:18,250
no exaggeration,
so was like a baseball sized hole and 

2211
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:22,181
he's got two of them.
He's got another one lower down on his 

2212
01:45:22,181 --> 01:45:24,311
back,
which is eating its way through his 

2213
01:45:24,311 --> 01:45:24,311
body.
But that was,

2214
01:45:24,311 --> 01:45:24,311
that was a year before he died.
Right?

2215
01:45:24,311 --> 01:45:24,970
Or say some years.
Yeah,

2216
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:26,950
it was years before he died.
Um,

2217
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:29,900
but who knows,
like how devastating that might've been.

2218
01:45:29,901 --> 01:45:34,901
Like that's a really,
really bad infection and I think that 

2219
01:45:34,901 --> 01:45:37,880
once your body's that compromise to me,
you're like really close to.

2220
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:40,670
I mean he's a real.
He was a really tough,

2221
01:45:40,671 --> 01:45:42,260
strong,
healthy guy.

2222
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:47,530
He was a super athlete so I'm assuming 
his body probably fought it off pretty 

2223
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:52,451
well.
So it's probably one of the reasons why 

2224
01:45:52,451 --> 01:45:52,451
you let it go so long.
Probably didn't,

2225
01:45:52,451 --> 01:45:55,340
maybe didn't even understand how 
dangerous it was or who knows.

2226
01:45:55,341 --> 01:45:56,870
Maybe it just jumped on him really 
quick.

2227
01:45:57,450 --> 01:46:00,870
My Dad's girlfriend just got it on her 
face and she was in the hospital for two

2228
01:46:00,871 --> 01:46:05,871
weeks and they were afraid it was going 
to spread to her brain and it almost 

2229
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:08,541
did.
And she's not 100 percent out of the 

2230
01:46:08,541 --> 01:46:08,541
woods yet,
but she's back home now.

2231
01:46:08,541 --> 01:46:13,200
It's just got a little scratch on her 
face and it spread into her cheek and 

2232
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:17,391
then into heard from her cheek.
She got a little red swelling and then 

2233
01:46:17,391 --> 01:46:17,570
she couldn't see.
And then she had to go in the hospital.

2234
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:21,600
You got staff chill out.
Heavy antibiotics right away.

2235
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:23,620
Yeah,
that's it.

2236
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:28,590
This is one area that this,
this worries me.

2237
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:29,510
They were,
I mean they're,

2238
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:34,520
they're the bad things we do.
And obviously there's a lot to be 

2239
01:46:34,621 --> 01:46:35,520
worried about their,
you know,

2240
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:38,340
the stupid wars and the,
and the,

2241
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:39,990
uh,
things that,

2242
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:41,820
it's just obvious that,
that,

2243
01:46:41,821 --> 01:46:43,620
um,
you know,

2244
01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:48,090
if we could stop creating needless pain 
for ourselves or needles conflict,

2245
01:46:48,091 --> 01:46:50,580
you know,
that would lead a much nicer life.

2246
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:56,030
But then there are the good things we 
neglect to do based on the fact that we 

2247
01:46:56,030 --> 01:47:00,621
just can't,
we don't have a system where the 

2248
01:47:00,621 --> 01:47:01,710
incentives are aligned to just make it 
easy or,

2249
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,360
or,
um,

2250
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:09,560
truly compelling to do them.
And the idea that we are not producing 

2251
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:15,560
the next generation of antibiotics as 
quickly as possible is just unthinkable 

2252
01:47:16,261 --> 01:47:16,920
to me.
And yet,

2253
01:47:16,921 --> 01:47:21,921
and yet we simply were just hamstrung by
the fact that we have a political and 

2254
01:47:21,921 --> 01:47:22,050
economic system.

2255
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,180
That is where the,
this,

2256
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:26,190
there's no incentive,
right?

2257
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:28,470
Like the government.
We don't want to raise taxes,

2258
01:47:28,471 --> 01:47:28,960
right?
We don't,

2259
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:33,090
we're so over committed in the ways we 
spend money,

2260
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:35,010
uh,
the public money,

2261
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:39,360
um,
and we're so short sighted that we,

2262
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:43,170
even if we suddenly saved money in one 
area,

2263
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:48,171
it's not like we would immediately 
directed to this lifesaving necessary 

2264
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:48,171
work,
right?

2265
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:52,560
Um,
and the market can't get on top of this.

2266
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:53,700
So it's,
it really would,

2267
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:55,350
it would be like,
you know,

2268
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:57,050
uh,
something that,

2269
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:02,060
you know,
the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 

2270
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,921
could do and maybe maybe they're 
actually doing this and I just don't 

2271
01:48:03,921 --> 01:48:06,621
know about it.
They're doing a lot of medical work 

2272
01:48:06,621 --> 01:48:06,621
obviously.
But,

2273
01:48:06,621 --> 01:48:06,621
um,
yeah,

2274
01:48:06,621 --> 01:48:10,230
we're talking about some billions of 
dollars to just get this.

2275
01:48:10,330 --> 01:48:13,440
You get kind of a laser focus on,
on this problem.

2276
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:18,470
But it's such an obvious problem.
And that's really the only thing that's 

2277
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:18,470
holding it back.

2278
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:19,950
That's what's going on.
It's not a research issue,

2279
01:48:19,951 --> 01:48:21,750
it's just a financial issue.
Well,

2280
01:48:21,751 --> 01:48:23,970
I'm sure that the research has to be 
done because it's,

2281
01:48:23,971 --> 01:48:24,590
you know,
if it was,

2282
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:29,630
if it was totally obvious how to build 
the next generation of antibiotics that 

2283
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:34,460
would not be vulnerable to having their 
efficacy canceled,

2284
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:36,770
you know,
in,

2285
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:41,430
in three years by just just the natural 
selection among the microbes,

2286
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:45,420
you know,
someone would do it very,

2287
01:48:45,421 --> 01:48:46,380
very cheaply.
But,

2288
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:47,550
uh,
so it's,

2289
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:48,540
uh,
I'm,

2290
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:51,840
I'll admit that it,
it's probably not easy to do,

2291
01:48:51,841 --> 01:48:56,160
but it's got to be doable and it's super
important to do.

2292
01:48:56,161 --> 01:49:01,161
I mean,
when you look at just what cesspools 

2293
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:01,640
hospitals have become,
where people come at,

2294
01:49:01,641 --> 01:49:05,670
you know,
something like 200,000

2295
01:49:05,671 --> 01:49:10,671
people a year die in the US based on 
essentially getting,

2296
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:14,850
been getting killed by the machinery of 
the hospital right there,

2297
01:49:14,851 --> 01:49:16,710
getting killed by their doctors and 
nurses.

2298
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:18,750
Most of them,
some of this is,

2299
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,850
is um,
you know,

2300
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,600
drug overdoses or,
or,

2301
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:25,320
or,
um,

2302
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:30,710
kind of incompetence in,
in dosing or given some of the wrong 

2303
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:30,710
medication or whatever,
you know,

2304
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:31,140
200,000
people,

2305
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:32,340
200,000
people a year.

2306
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:37,400
Right.
But a lot of it is just doctors not 

2307
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:37,400
washing their hands.
Right.

2308
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:41,240
And,
but some of this is also super bugs 

2309
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:41,240
where it's like,
it's,

2310
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:44,910
it's the burden on hand washing in a 
hospital is higher and higher because 

2311
01:49:45,031 --> 01:49:49,720
hospitals just or just covered in,
in super germs,

2312
01:49:49,721 --> 01:49:51,970
right?
So it's a,

2313
01:49:51,971 --> 01:49:52,180
a

2314
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:57,240
cycle haunted house.
You're trying to fix people and around 

2315
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:01,171
the house or a bunch of demons that are 
trying to kill people you're trying to 

2316
01:50:01,171 --> 01:50:01,171
fix.
I mean that if look,

2317
01:50:01,171 --> 01:50:05,611
obviously it's not,
but if you were a person who was 

2318
01:50:05,611 --> 01:50:09,061
inclined to believe things like back in 
the day before they figured out 

2319
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:09,790
microscopes,
I mean,

2320
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:13,150
what else is that other than a demon?
You've got a hospital that's filled with

2321
01:50:13,151 --> 01:50:14,530
super bugs.
Where else are they?

2322
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:19,770
There's nowhere else in the hospitals 
and Jim were they getting them?

2323
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:25,531
Probably from the hospitals,
but it's just like a haunted house 

2324
01:50:25,531 --> 01:50:29,490
circle.
Hunter House is trying to kill the 

2325
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:29,490
people that live in the house.

2326
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:33,040
It is well,
and it's also just ironic that you go to

2327
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:35,230
the hospital to save your life,
right?

2328
01:50:35,231 --> 01:50:40,000
You go when you are,
by definition you're most vulnerable and

2329
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:45,510
you are a and you're in your lane,
your body open to the intrusions of the 

2330
01:50:47,471 --> 01:50:50,170
place because that means they have to 
get.

2331
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:53,020
They have to get into your body to help 
you.

2332
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:58,021
Right,
and yet that is the very mechanism 

2333
01:50:58,021 --> 01:51:02,430
whereby you're getting all this misery 
and death imposed on you and it's.

2334
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:06,160
It is as simple as hand washing though 
in many of these cases,

2335
01:51:06,161 --> 01:51:08,530
right?
It's just doctors and nurses not washing

2336
01:51:08,531 --> 01:51:10,750
their hands.
That is insane.

2337
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:15,810
It's so insane to think that that is a 
gigantic issue that we have these bugs 

2338
01:51:16,221 --> 01:51:18,590
that tried to get into your body and 
kill you is one.

2339
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:23,760
So that's one area.
I don't know if you ever had the bad 

2340
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,020
luck to be associated with a Nicu and 
neonatal Icu,

2341
01:51:26,021 --> 01:51:31,021
but our first daughter who's totally 
fine was born five weeks early and had 

2342
01:51:31,571 --> 01:51:36,571
to be in the Nicu for a week and there 
are people who are in the Nicu for 

2343
01:51:36,571 --> 01:51:36,571
months,
you know,

2344
01:51:36,571 --> 01:51:39,550
the babies born at 23 weeks or so.

2345
01:51:40,210 --> 01:51:41,830
Um,
and it's just,

2346
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:44,680
it's just a totally heroin.
But,

2347
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:49,770
um,
but also just these incredibly 

2348
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:52,651
compassionate,
just amazing places where you just 

2349
01:51:52,651 --> 01:51:53,050
doctors,
nurses or our total heroes,

2350
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:58,950
but that's a space where you see the 
hand washing protocol just exactly as it

2351
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,360
needs to be.
You know,

2352
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:03,160
like people are,
they just have,

2353
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:05,630
have understood,
you know,

2354
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:10,710
finally that you,
if you're going to go into the Nicu and 

2355
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:14,251
see your baby or be around anyone else's
baby and you are going to wash your 

2356
01:52:14,251 --> 01:52:17,380
hands in as complete way as,
as,

2357
01:52:17,381 --> 01:52:19,120
um,
21st century science.

2358
01:52:19,121 --> 01:52:21,570
Understand how to do that.
And it's um,

2359
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:22,470
you know,
it is.

2360
01:52:22,471 --> 01:52:25,150
It's almost like the decontamination 
zone of,

2361
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:30,180
you know,
Silkwood the nuclear reactor or she get 

2362
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:31,930
hosed down.
Um,

2363
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:32,850
but it's,
uh,

2364
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:34,430
yeah,
it's uh,

2365
01:52:34,431 --> 01:52:37,690
my hand washing and the fact that we 
can't even do that perfectly.

2366
01:52:37,691 --> 01:52:38,410
It's pretty impressive.

2367
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:44,660
Now,
is it a fact that mercer was created by 

2368
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:46,370
medications or is that a belief or has 
that been proven

2369
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:48,980
that it was created by a resistance to 
medications?

2370
01:52:48,981 --> 01:52:50,810
It gets stronger?
Yeah.

2371
01:52:50,811 --> 01:52:51,170
Well,
no.

2372
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:56,520
Yes,
it's a fact that all of these bugs are 

2373
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:01,370
evolving and just by dent of 
happenstance,

2374
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:06,670
they are producing a changes in their 
genome that leaves them no longer 

2375
01:53:08,571 --> 01:53:11,750
vulnerable to antibiotic X.
Right.

2376
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:15,170
Um,
so whether it's methicillin or,

2377
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:20,230
or any of it's related antibiotics,
and so that,

2378
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:23,360
this is what antibiotic resistance is.
These,

2379
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:25,070
these,
these bacteria,

2380
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:26,750
um,
uh,

2381
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:32,020
their genomes mutate and unfortunately 
with bacteria they also can swap jeans 

2382
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:38,920
let laterally across bacterial species.
So it's not like only their descendants 

2383
01:53:39,981 --> 01:53:44,360
in that line can inherit that,
these genetic changes they can,

2384
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:47,900
they can transfer genetic changes across
bacteria.

2385
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:50,990
So it just,
it optimizes the process.

2386
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:52,490
And again,
this is all blind.

2387
01:53:52,491 --> 01:53:55,430
It's not like bacteria want to become 
drug resistant,

2388
01:53:55,431 --> 01:54:00,431
but some percentage of them in any 
generation will tend to become in some 

2389
01:54:01,491 --> 01:54:06,491
generation,
will become drug resistant and then 

2390
01:54:06,491 --> 01:54:06,500
that,
then then in the presence of the drug,

2391
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:08,610
they will be selected for,
you know,

2392
01:54:08,730 --> 01:54:12,830
if you keep bombarding people with 
penicillin,

2393
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:19,960
you will be selecting for the bacteria 
that isn't sensitive to penicillin in 

2394
01:54:20,691 --> 01:54:25,691
those people and say the overuse of 
antibiotics and the overuse of 

2395
01:54:25,691 --> 01:54:27,620
antibiotics in our food chain is also 
part of this picture.

2396
01:54:27,650 --> 01:54:29,690
Right?
So it's the fact that we are,

2397
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:32,470
I don't know what the percentage is,
but it's,

2398
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:37,880
it's more antibiotic use certainly in 
cattle and pigs than in,

2399
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:39,380
uh,
people.

2400
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:44,720
Um,
and the same evolutionary principles are

2401
01:54:44,721 --> 01:54:46,100
happening there too.
So,

2402
01:54:46,230 --> 01:54:48,160
you know,
so you don't know what,

2403
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:51,940
what we're doing to ourselves.
I,

2404
01:54:52,110 --> 01:54:57,050
it can't be good to be using antibiotics
everywhere in agriculture.

2405
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:59,600
And then kind of waiting to see what 
happens.

2406
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:04,630
Well,
we know for a fact that we get diseases 

2407
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:04,630
mean swine flu,
avian flu like Josie,

2408
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:05,330
no viruses.
Yeah.

2409
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:10,680
Yeah.
And a lot of these are coming out of 

2410
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:10,790
these facilities where they're 
processing cattle,

2411
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:12,880
pigs,
I mean,

2412
01:55:12,881 --> 01:55:17,881
that's another element to it.
So it's just that most of infectious 

2413
01:55:17,881 --> 01:55:21,491
disease over the ages has been born of 
proximity to animals and that's the 

2414
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:29,030
result of agriculture.
So the fact that you have people in bird

2415
01:55:29,031 --> 01:55:31,900
markets in China who,
you know,

2416
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:36,910
they're,
they're dealing with with chickens and 

2417
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:40,610
ducks endlessly in confinement,
and then you've got,

2418
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:43,220
you know,
wild birds flying overhead,

2419
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:47,490
dropping their droppings into that space
and you have,

2420
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:51,300
you just,
and you have a viruses that jump species

2421
01:55:51,301 --> 01:55:53,880
from,
from birds to pigs and back again.

2422
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,320
And uh,
you know,

2423
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:59,230
some of the stuff only stays in those 
animals and,

2424
01:55:59,231 --> 01:56:02,700
and doesn't become active and people.
But again,

2425
01:56:02,701 --> 01:56:03,400
it's just,
it's just like,

2426
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,780
is this evolution is just this endless 
lottery,

2427
01:56:06,781 --> 01:56:11,781
we'll where it's just,
you just got change and change and 

2428
01:56:11,781 --> 01:56:14,031
change upon change and um,
something makes the jump in this case 

2429
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:22,731
between species and thrives or not based
on the opportunities to thrive.

2430
01:56:23,671 --> 01:56:26,160
So you have something that becomes 
airborne,

2431
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:26,760
right?
You have,

2432
01:56:26,810 --> 01:56:28,170
you have a,
a,

2433
01:56:28,171 --> 01:56:33,171
um,
a virus that is absolutely deadly and 

2434
01:56:33,171 --> 01:56:36,591
people but isn't airborne and is 
difficult to contract,

2435
01:56:36,811 --> 01:56:37,110
right?
Well,

2436
01:56:37,111 --> 01:56:39,480
then it's a,
it's a fairly well behaved,

2437
01:56:39,481 --> 01:56:40,770
you know,
it could be scary,

2438
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,230
but it's not going to become a global 
pandemic,

2439
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:48,231
but then suddenly you could get a 
mutation on that virus or that bacteria 

2440
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,610
that allows it to be,
you know,

2441
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:55,670
aspirated in,
become airborne and a cough and hailed 

2442
01:56:55,670 --> 01:56:57,060
and big and spread that way.

2443
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,280
Well then you have this,
this,

2444
01:56:59,281 --> 01:57:00,290
um,
you know,

2445
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:05,300
the possibility of a pandemic and um,
and also the time course of an illness 

2446
01:57:06,271 --> 01:57:07,650
is,
is irrelevant.

2447
01:57:07,651 --> 01:57:12,651
So you have,
you have something which kills you very 

2448
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:13,230
quickly and horribly.
Well then that's,

2449
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:18,260
that's the kind of thing that is going 
to be harder to spread because people 

2450
01:57:18,631 --> 01:57:20,460
become suddenly so sick.
They don't,

2451
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:23,610
they're not getting on airplanes,
they're not going to conferences,

2452
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:26,330
they're not starting new relationships.
They're,

2453
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:28,470
they're in bed dying,
right?

2454
01:57:28,471 --> 01:57:31,290
So,
but if you had something that had a time

2455
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:35,700
course that you felt great for a month,
but you're yet your infectious,

2456
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:38,340
uh,
and then it kills you will then,

2457
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:44,120
then it's spread is only limited by the 
damage you can do in that month of 

2458
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:45,330
gallivanting around.
Right?

2459
01:57:45,331 --> 01:57:45,840
You know,
so,

2460
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:47,910
um,
it's a,

2461
01:57:47,911 --> 01:57:49,260
um,
and again,

2462
01:57:49,261 --> 01:57:51,690
these mutations are just happening 
spontaneously.

2463
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:53,280
So it's,
it's a,

2464
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:55,200
it really is a,
um,

2465
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:00,990
it's a matter of good and bad luck.
They all have one function.

2466
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:04,530
What killed things they do,
our,

2467
01:58:04,531 --> 01:58:09,531
they overcome,
they overcome bodies with their life 

2468
01:58:09,531 --> 01:58:09,531
form.
They spread.

2469
01:58:09,531 --> 01:58:11,910
Will there have met their other 
functions.

2470
01:58:11,911 --> 01:58:16,911
I mean,
obviously this is all blind and there 

2471
01:58:16,911 --> 01:58:19,660
was no intention or purpose behind it,
but there are viruses and other 

2472
01:58:23,281 --> 01:58:27,040
infectious diseases that produce 
penicillin know that.

2473
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:30,300
But the produce functions which,
which are behaviorally relevant.

2474
01:58:30,301 --> 01:58:33,360
I mean,
so that there was a spread and forgotten

2475
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:34,410
is it?
Um,

2476
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:40,280
so toxoplasmosis it makes mice less 
fearful and the presence of cats.

2477
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:42,260
Yeah.

2478
01:58:42,450 --> 01:58:42,880
Yeah.
So,

2479
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:46,360
so like say the behavioral changes that 
makes them attracted to urine,

2480
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:49,300
right?
They get erect right around cat urine.

2481
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:55,110
So he's into their demise,
so it spreads to cats and there are 

2482
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:55,110
theses that that either

2483
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:58,320
infectious diseases that change human 
behavior that,

2484
01:58:58,370 --> 01:59:03,370
you know,
the depression is the result of 

2485
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:07,010
infectious illness that we're not aware 
of or um,

2486
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:10,730
um,
yeah,

2487
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:15,790
I mean,
so there's a lot that could be going 

2488
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:18,050
wrong with us that we haven't attributed
to viruses and bacteria,

2489
01:59:18,051 --> 01:59:21,080
which in fact are,
is at bottom a matter of a virus,

2490
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:22,250
viruses and bacteria.
Actually,

2491
01:59:22,251 --> 01:59:27,251
Alzheimer's is,
there was recently a report that 

2492
01:59:27,251 --> 01:59:31,870
suggested that Alzheimer's is the result
of a brain's immune response to 

2493
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:38,090
infection,
infectious illness,

2494
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:39,010
um,
uh,

2495
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:42,500
I think it was bacterial,
um,

2496
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:46,160
this is just in the last week or so that
the,

2497
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:51,790
um,
the plaques associated with Alzheimer's 

2498
01:59:51,790 --> 01:59:55,181
that you see throughout the brain might 
in fact be the remnants of an immune 

2499
01:59:57,351 --> 02:00:01,370
response to some something having 
invaded the cross,

2500
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,740
the blood brain barrier.
Um,

2501
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:09,400
so yeah,
so if Alzheimer's is the result of 

2502
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:11,120
infectious disease and that,
that is a score that as a,

2503
02:00:11,121 --> 02:00:12,230
um,
as a,

2504
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:17,310
uh,
a major problem that would be nice to 

2505
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:18,410
solve with the right antibiotic regime.

2506
02:00:18,790 --> 02:00:19,750
Could you imagine?
I mean,

2507
02:00:19,751 --> 02:00:22,530
that would have been fascinated if that 
existed during Reagan's time.

2508
02:00:22,531 --> 02:00:26,170
I think it just clear them up because 
you remember when he will,

2509
02:00:26,190 --> 02:00:30,340
like when when someone publicly starts 
to go like that and it's a,

2510
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:35,350
a guy like Ronald Reagan who was an 
actor and a president and you see him 

2511
02:00:35,351 --> 02:00:37,940
starting to lose his grip on his memory.
You knew,

2512
02:00:37,941 --> 02:00:42,941
you hear all the reports about it that 
it's a particularly disturbing because 

2513
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:45,670
it's exhibited,
it means that's the head guy,

2514
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:48,190
you know,
to think that that was just a disease.

2515
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:49,480
That's crazy.

2516
02:00:49,490 --> 02:00:51,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

2517
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:55,310
I don't remember when that became at all
obvious.

2518
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:56,380
I remember.
I,

2519
02:00:56,400 --> 02:01:00,740
I know people were trying to do a kind 
of a retrospective analysis of it,

2520
02:01:00,741 --> 02:01:05,741
but I don't remember when anyone started
to talk about the possibility that he 

2521
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:12,700
was not all there and I don't remember 
it happening actually during his 

2522
02:01:13,161 --> 02:01:14,220
presidency,
but know

2523
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:16,360
you were both young at that point.
So,

2524
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:21,640
um,
I do remember comedians doing jokes 

2525
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:21,640
about it.
Yeah.

2526
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:23,590
That's like one of my main points of 
references or we'll.

2527
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:29,020
They did have this like weird sort of 
out of it grandpa type character that 

2528
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:32,380
they would do towards his second run,
you know?

2529
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:38,640
Right.
I don't know if that was years before 

2530
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:39,350
they were referencing like when,
when was it all going bad them?

2531
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:42,740
Yeah.
I mean neurologists are very neurologist

2532
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:46,910
can spot neurological illness really 
well.

2533
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:47,530
I mean they,
they,

2534
02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:51,530
they are walking around seeing 
neurological illness all over the place.

2535
02:01:51,531 --> 02:01:56,531
I'm sure there were neurologists who 
were talking about him long before 

2536
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:59,210
anyone else was in those terms.
Well,

2537
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:01,980
there was this old joke that Jimmy 
tingled did.

2538
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:05,300
Timmy tingles hilarious political 
comedian from Boston.

2539
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:10,510
He had this joke about a Ronald Reagan's
trial where he couldn't remember if he 

2540
02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:11,030
sold arms to Iran.

2541
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:16,460
It was Mr to President next time you 
sell ams to Iran,

2542
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:20,870
jotted down,
make a note,

2543
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:24,380
put it on the refrigerator,
but it was just.

2544
02:02:24,810 --> 02:02:29,300
That was his.
That was his excuse when he was in trial

2545
02:02:29,301 --> 02:02:31,730
and everybody thought that this is 
bullshit.

2546
02:02:31,731 --> 02:02:33,680
This is his defense.
He doesn't remember,

2547
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:35,270
and then it started coming out that he 
had.

2548
02:02:35,271 --> 02:02:37,550
And then the conspiracy theory was he 
was always fine.

2549
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,760
He was like,
was that guy's name Vincent the Chin 

2550
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:43,100
Gigante who'd walk around in a bathrobe 
and pretend to be crazy.

2551
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:45,020
I remember that guy,
the mob guy.

2552
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:48,230
No,
there's a famous mob guy who was running

2553
02:02:48,231 --> 02:02:50,390
the mob but pretending to be a crazy old
man.

2554
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:53,900
So he would walk around with people.
I forget how they busted him,

2555
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:59,110
but he had it nailed.
He'd walked around the bath robe and 

2556
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:02,231
talk to himself and he will put on an 
act like going on the street and act 

2557
02:03:02,231 --> 02:03:02,231
like a crazy person.

2558
02:03:02,231 --> 02:03:04,460
And then he would go on walks with like 
these capos and tell them,

2559
02:03:04,461 --> 02:03:09,461
look,
kill this fucking guy and get me a 

2560
02:03:09,461 --> 02:03:09,461
million bucks and all that kind of crazy
shit.

2561
02:03:09,461 --> 02:03:12,230
But all the while he had an world wire.
Some somehow or another they caught him.

2562
02:03:12,231 --> 02:03:13,880
I don't remember exactly how they caught
them,

2563
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:17,390
but everyone knew like they kind of knew
he was doing that.

2564
02:03:17,391 --> 02:03:19,430
And so some people were thinking that's 
what Reagan was doing.

2565
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:21,380
It was getting closer.
I don't remember what I did,

2566
02:03:21,381 --> 02:03:23,120
what I ran in a matter of fact,
I don't remember shit.

2567
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:28,390
I can't think I got a disease.
I can't remember anything and just 

2568
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:29,540
started pretending was.
It could be both.

2569
02:03:29,541 --> 02:03:34,541
Could be true.
I mean he could only clearly did have 

2570
02:03:34,541 --> 02:03:34,541
Alzheimer's in the end,
but he could have also been lying.

2571
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:40,300
What if it was a big conspiracy?
There'll be a great movie like how good 

2572
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:43,961
of an actor was Ronald Reagan who was 
such a good actor to the latter days of 

2573
02:03:43,961 --> 02:03:43,961
his years.

2574
02:03:43,961 --> 02:03:45,110
You've avoided interviews by pretending 
to have Alzheimer's.

2575
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:47,870
He felt like that was the only way out,
so it just.

2576
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:50,510
Him and Nancy,
they prepped her lines and when,

2577
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:53,180
when you know he'd go out there to the 
public,

2578
02:03:53,181 --> 02:03:55,070
he just started acting like he couldn't 
remember anything.

2579
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:01,480
Alzheimer's.
Unfortunately it's going to be a bigger 

2580
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,341
and bigger story.
It's really a baby boomer moment is 

2581
02:04:03,341 --> 02:04:07,120
coming and it's just going to.
This is something we need a full court 

2582
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:07,370
press on to.
Yeah.

2583
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:12,050
If you can find that that's actually a 
disease and you can cure that disease.

2584
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:15,340
That's a disease and infectious disease.
Well,

2585
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:20,350
the,
if you ever seen the support stuff on 

2586
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:23,261
the Toxoplasma Robertson Stanford,
he's the guy that's like one of the four

2587
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:30,070
forefront researchers and one of the 
guys is like really vocal about stress 

2588
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:30,140
and.
But he,

2589
02:04:30,170 --> 02:04:35,170
yeah,
they were also talking about a direct 

2590
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:35,630
proportionate,
a direct relationship between motorcycle

2591
02:04:35,631 --> 02:04:40,631
crashes and testing positive for 
toxoplasmosis and they felt,

2592
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:46,551
they felt that it might've either 
hindered reaction time or loosened 

2593
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:51,770
inhibitions to same way it sort of 
triggers these mice to go near cats.

2594
02:04:51,790 --> 02:04:52,390
Yeah,
yeah,

2595
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:53,640
yeah.
That's what I was referencing.

2596
02:04:53,690 --> 02:04:57,460
Yeah.
So I think it's a lot of,

2597
02:04:57,461 --> 02:04:59,900
it's speculation,
but there's a lot of strong court.

2598
02:04:59,901 --> 02:05:03,600
There's a strong correlation apparently 
to motorcycle crashes and that is,

2599
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:08,810
I guess one of his professors had told 
him that when he was younger and he 

2600
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:12,770
remembered it while they were dealing 
with some guy who came into the er 

2601
02:05:12,770 --> 02:05:15,150
victim of motorcycle crash,
but it kind of makes sense.

2602
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:17,010
Yeah.
Well,

2603
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:22,011
you know,
the underlying biology of risk avoidance

2604
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:26,550
and,
and not risk seeking is,

2605
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:31,820
that's fairly well conserved in mammals.
It's not like there's a reason why we do

2606
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:37,110
most of our research in things like 
mice.

2607
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:40,770
I mean,
it's not a totally analogous brain,

2608
02:05:40,771 --> 02:05:44,420
but it's are similar enough to us that,
you know,

2609
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:47,400
doing research on dopamine receptors in 
mice is,

2610
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:52,850
allows us to extrapolate to humans and 
um,

2611
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:54,420
yeah,
so it's a um,

2612
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:56,890
uh,
it's not,

2613
02:05:56,891 --> 02:06:00,450
it wouldn't be a surprise that it's 
having an effect on people.

2614
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:04,170
Was it Steve?
Remember I was supposed to bring this up

2615
02:06:04,171 --> 02:06:05,330
to you before?
Um,

2616
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:06,780
when you were talking about,
um,

2617
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:10,110
plants and plants having some sort of a 
consciousness,

2618
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:12,510
was it steven pinker see if you could 
find this?

2619
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:17,720
Who gave a speech where he talked about 
how some plants you can actually use 

2620
02:06:18,421 --> 02:06:23,421
sedatives on them and that some of them 
actually produced certain neurochemicals

2621
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:29,090
like dopamine,
if that makes any sense that Steven 

2622
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:29,090
pinker.
No,

2623
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:29,520
it didn't make any sense.
Right?

2624
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:34,820
Well,
it was surprised me if pinker said 

2625
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:34,820
anything about this,
but I haven't heard anything about it.

2626
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:36,960
I think it was a speech he was given 
about something,

2627
02:06:36,961 --> 02:06:41,961
but I think it's controversial.
It's one of the reasons why I wanted to 

2628
02:06:41,961 --> 02:06:44,331
bring it up to you because I had never 
heard that before that a plant can 

2629
02:06:44,331 --> 02:06:48,680
produce.
It was either dopamine or Serotonin in 

2630
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:49,290
that somehow or another sedatives would 
be,

2631
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:53,040
would be effective on a plant.

2632
02:06:53,370 --> 02:06:56,910
I tell it didn't make any sense.
I don't know what effective means.

2633
02:06:56,990 --> 02:06:57,930
Uh,
I don't know either.

2634
02:06:57,931 --> 02:07:01,620
That's why I waited for you have a plant
that's pretty.

2635
02:07:01,621 --> 02:07:03,000
Well,
it's a dated as far as I'm concerned.

2636
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:04,490
I remember as soon as I saw this,
I'm like,

2637
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:07,860
must get this to Sam Harris,
please decipher.

2638
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:13,640
But I actually.
Everything I almost everything I 

2639
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:15,720
remember about or that I learned about 
plant biology I've forgotten.

2640
02:07:15,721 --> 02:07:19,830
So I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure if you can't find it

2641
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:24,270
does not have a brain stuff for Steven 
pinker and in plants and consciousness,

2642
02:07:24,271 --> 02:07:27,140
but nothing with sedatives specifically 
coming up with that.

2643
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:29,380
Maybe it was two.
Maybe I can come.

2644
02:07:29,430 --> 02:07:32,610
What's the combined two different 
articles they made?

2645
02:07:32,630 --> 02:07:34,380
Did the pink one?
I know it was.

2646
02:07:34,450 --> 02:07:36,010
What did what pinker say about

2647
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:37,450
plants and consciousness?
Oh,

2648
02:07:37,451 --> 02:07:41,170
he was just talking about the surprising
amount of calculations.

2649
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:42,580
I think that was one of the,
uh,

2650
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:45,340
we'd have to read the entire piece,
but I think it was just,

2651
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:50,370
they were just highlighting what we know
so far I've reached the limits of the 

2652
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:50,370
human bladder.
Oh,

2653
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:53,230
how dare you this early.
You're too healthy,

2654
02:07:53,231 --> 02:07:54,550
man.
Coffee and water.

2655
02:07:55,390 --> 02:07:56,860
So what have you found on it,
Jamie?

2656
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:00,440
Not really,
nothing specific about it,

2657
02:08:00,441 --> 02:08:03,770
but I did have something earlier that 
was kind of interesting.

2658
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:06,020
I'll show it to you here when you was 
talking about Ai.

2659
02:08:06,021 --> 02:08:09,470
I put up something on minority report 
and that pulled me to this article,

2660
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:14,240
which Microsoft has an app that can,
it's actually developed by Hitachi.

2661
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:18,200
It's called predictive crime and that 
analytics,

2662
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:22,430
um,
they can predict crimes up to 91 percent

2663
02:08:22,431 --> 02:08:27,431
accuracy.
And then there's also already being 

2664
02:08:27,431 --> 02:08:30,800
enacted at Maryland and Pennsylvania as 
of 2013.

2665
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:36,520
They have crime prediction software that
can find out if an inmate that's going 

2666
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:38,480
to be released is going to predict or 
committed another crime.

2667
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:40,880
And so they're using that to follow 
them.

2668
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:43,470
And there's some civil rights people 
that are saying like,

2669
02:08:43,490 --> 02:08:45,800
you can't do that.
Obviously that's not good.

2670
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:47,940
Hold on,
scroll down just a little bit.

2671
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:51,150
What is it?
Professor Burke says his algorithm could

2672
02:08:51,151 --> 02:08:56,151
be used to help set bail amounts and 
also decides sentences in the future.

2673
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:58,720
And then I got down to this part in 
Chicago.

2674
02:08:58,721 --> 02:09:00,130
They're doing something and they have 
it.

2675
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:05,190
It's called a heat list in Chicago.
They have 400 residents that are listed 

2676
02:09:05,190 --> 02:09:09,061
as potential victims and subjects with 
the greatest propensity of violence and 

2677
02:09:09,061 --> 02:09:10,840
they go and knock on their door and tell
them that they're being watched.

2678
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:16,620
And I like I've clicked on this thing 
and it's an actual like Chicago 

2679
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:20,311
directive from the police.org.
It's a pilot program about going and 

2680
02:09:20,311 --> 02:09:24,811
tell people that are being watched for 
someone might be after you or some shit 

2681
02:09:24,811 --> 02:09:27,280
like that out.
It's really crazy.

2682
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:29,200
I didn't want to interrupt you guys to 
tell you about this,

2683
02:09:29,201 --> 02:09:29,440
but

2684
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:34,170
custom notification under the violence 
reduction initiative in partnership with

2685
02:09:34,171 --> 02:09:39,171
the John Jay College of criminal justice
community team who will serve as 

2686
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:43,260
outreach partners when the social 
service and community partners show show

2687
02:09:43,261 --> 02:09:44,700
him this.
This is crazy.

2688
02:09:44,701 --> 02:09:49,701
While the while we were doing this,
Microsoft has this,

2689
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:52,500
these programs scroll up to the top 
Jamie.

2690
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:59,360
They revealed an application they think 
that can predict crimes in the future 

2691
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:01,200
and decide if inmates get parole.

2692
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:04,900
It uses all sorts of data,
public data from twitter,

2693
02:10:05,070 --> 02:10:09,370
a closed circuit camera feeds,
public Wifi signals.

2694
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:14,590
There's like an la.
There's all sorts of microphones all 

2695
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:14,590
over the place listening for gunshots 
and whatnot.

2696
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:19,360
There's this New Light Poles I told you 
about that are adding four g 

2697
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:22,500
connectivity to the city that obviously 
can be added to this probably if they 

2698
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:22,500
needed it.

2699
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:23,360
Sure.
Yeah.

2700
02:10:23,361 --> 02:10:24,900
That doesn't surprise me at all.
I mean,

2701
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:26,240
I think,
I think that is a,

2702
02:10:26,241 --> 02:10:29,000
um,
all of that's come in.

2703
02:10:29,001 --> 02:10:31,550
I mean it would just look at just 
consumer behavior.

2704
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:34,250
We just just look at how someone

2705
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:39,250
can understand about you based on your 
zip code and your last three Netflix 

2706
02:10:40,521 --> 02:10:44,510
movies you watch to the end and it just 
a few other data points,

2707
02:10:44,511 --> 02:10:49,511
right?
And then we basically know we can 

2708
02:10:49,511 --> 02:10:49,511
predict,
you know,

2709
02:10:49,511 --> 02:10:52,820
with some horrendous accuracy what 
you're going to like a given,

2710
02:10:52,850 --> 02:10:54,050
you know,
the menu of options.

2711
02:10:54,051 --> 02:10:55,490
I mean,
we can advertise to you,

2712
02:10:55,570 --> 02:10:56,370
uh,
with,

2713
02:10:56,620 --> 02:11:00,560
with immense precision.
I'm in facebook,

2714
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:02,660
obviously is,
is at the forefront of this,

2715
02:11:02,661 --> 02:11:05,330
but uh,
when you talk about,

2716
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:12,010
when you add everything else that's 
coming more and more intrusive 

2717
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,840
technology of the sort we've been 
talking about,

2718
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:15,920
it's,
you know,

2719
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:18,830
none of that surprising,
right?

2720
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:23,720
Nothing surprising anymore.
If you had read that 30 years ago,

2721
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:26,060
it would have looked like an article in 
the onion here,

2722
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:26,950
right?
You'd be like,

2723
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:28,820
what they're going to have.
This is judge dredd.

2724
02:11:28,821 --> 02:11:31,190
This is crazy.
Here's the onion version,

2725
02:11:31,191 --> 02:11:32,570
which did just happen,
right?

2726
02:11:32,571 --> 02:11:35,570
I think this was Microsoft where they 
put out a,

2727
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:38,720
what they were calling an Ai Bot on 
twitter.

2728
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:43,900
There was a ai that just became a Hitler
loving sex spot because it was being 

2729
02:11:45,621 --> 02:11:48,830
turned up by its interaction with people
trolling on twitter.

2730
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:54,340
Did you see the guy who got arrested for
falling asleep inside his tesla when it 

2731
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:54,560
was on auto drive?
No.

2732
02:11:54,561 --> 02:11:54,990
No,
no,

2733
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:57,590
no.
He got busted.

2734
02:11:57,980 --> 02:11:59,930
I don't know if he got arrested.
He got busted though.

2735
02:11:59,931 --> 02:12:04,931
They have cameras.
Have camera photos of him rolling 

2736
02:12:04,931 --> 02:12:07,841
through an intersection,
completely unconscious on his way to 

2737
02:12:07,841 --> 02:12:07,841
work.
Look at this guy.

2738
02:12:07,841 --> 02:12:07,841
Look,
look at this.

2739
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:12,920
The car is driving him and he's asleep 
while it's on autopilot.

2740
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:15,530
This is insanity.
This is going to be okay.

2741
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:20,560
Great moment to see.
And I'm sure this is coming where a one 

2742
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:26,090
self driving cars become just obviously 
the only truly safe alternative.

2743
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:31,100
Then you'll be arrested for the opposite
violation.

2744
02:12:31,101 --> 02:12:32,250
You'll be,
you'll be arrested.

2745
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:37,270
W if your hands are on the wheel,
if you're driving a car that is this ape

2746
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:42,800
piloted as opposed to a robot driven.
And that's that say,

2747
02:12:42,801 --> 02:12:44,960
um,
maybe we got 30,000

2748
02:12:44,961 --> 02:12:49,580
people a year dying every year based on 
ape driving.

2749
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:52,730
Um,
so the moment we crack that,

2750
02:12:52,731 --> 02:12:55,050
which we're very close to doing,
um,

2751
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:57,670
it's just going to seem you're,
I mean,

2752
02:12:57,671 --> 02:13:02,671
you've,
you've got your old muscle cars or 

2753
02:13:02,671 --> 02:13:03,050
whatever you're into,
it's going to be like,

2754
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:05,030
that's going to be the equivalent of 
like,

2755
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:06,650
you know,
celebrate Tory gunfire.

2756
02:13:07,410 --> 02:13:09,150
You're going to reserve the right to 
like at,

2757
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:09,890
at your wedding

2758
02:13:10,170 --> 02:13:15,170
shoot,
shoot your ar 15 and the air and not 

2759
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:16,500
care where the bullet lands going to 
have to get a licensed,

2760
02:13:16,501 --> 02:13:21,501
operate them.
You're going to have to move out of the 

2761
02:13:21,501 --> 02:13:23,481
big city.
You get to take them to the hills and 

2762
02:13:23,481 --> 02:13:23,481
unload the amount of,
uh,

2763
02:13:23,481 --> 02:13:27,820
of the back of a truck driving for a 
very short distance as right monitor how

2764
02:13:28,621 --> 02:13:31,080
much a governor on them that they can go
five miles an hour.

2765
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:33,690
Yeah,
yeah.

2766
02:13:33,691 --> 02:13:36,330
I mean if you look at,
in terms of safety for sure.

2767
02:13:36,331 --> 02:13:39,240
And then it seems to be the thing that's
the reoccurring theme,

2768
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:41,970
right?
You give up your privacy for safety.

2769
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:44,160
He,
you give up your,

2770
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:47,430
your ability to drive a car wherever you
want,

2771
02:13:47,431 --> 02:13:50,190
whenever you want,
however you want to give that up to give

2772
02:13:50,191 --> 02:13:55,191
that up for safety and uh,
people are really reluctant to give up 

2773
02:13:55,191 --> 02:13:59,190
fun shit like lying and driving their 
car fast.

2774
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:04,340
Like those two things.
People are going to have a hard time 

2775
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:04,340
with you,
like actually getting into the,

2776
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:09,080
into their mind,
seeing their actual mind and being able 

2777
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:09,750
to do that so we can know without a 
doubt whether or not someone's guilty or

2778
02:14:09,751 --> 02:14:14,751
innocent.
But my question to you is if you could 

2779
02:14:14,751 --> 02:14:15,660
get inside someone's mind and it was 
like that really super.

2780
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:21,100
I'm a suggestive guy that you were 
talking about earlier that just 

2781
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:24,780
confessed all the horrific demonic 
possession stuff and eating babies.

2782
02:14:24,990 --> 02:14:27,270
What if it's like getting to that guy's 
mind?

2783
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:28,500
What if you can't tell?

2784
02:14:30,070 --> 02:14:33,400
Well,
the case that,

2785
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:38,460
that worries me,
and this is perhaps an inept segue to a 

2786
02:14:39,790 --> 02:14:41,050
politics,
but the,

2787
02:14:41,051 --> 02:14:45,550
um,
I mean we're in people's minds.

2788
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:50,940
You get someone talking long enough,
you know their minds.

2789
02:14:51,431 --> 02:14:51,710
I mean,
they,

2790
02:14:51,711 --> 02:14:56,711
they,
they can only conceal what they're 

2791
02:14:56,711 --> 02:14:56,711
about.
A only so well right,

2792
02:14:56,711 --> 02:14:58,960
and you can because you're a super smart
wizard type.

2793
02:14:59,310 --> 02:15:01,060
Just Jamie,
I don't know about.

2794
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:06,600
I don't know if he's a mind reader,
but the question is what will people 

2795
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:06,600
care?
You know?

2796
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,180
It's like if you,
if you have,

2797
02:15:07,181 --> 02:15:12,181
we don't even need a lie detector.
If you have someone who's openly line 

2798
02:15:12,181 --> 02:15:12,181
right,
who,

2799
02:15:12,181 --> 02:15:14,380
who just gets caught in lies again and 
again,

2800
02:15:14,410 --> 02:15:16,210
you could see it too.
You feel it right,

2801
02:15:16,211 --> 02:15:21,160
but people don't seem to care in the 
least in a political process.

2802
02:15:21,190 --> 02:15:26,190
Now I'm thinking in this case of trump 
where you have someone who is in in some

2803
02:15:26,621 --> 02:15:31,621
cases line or just changing his mind in 
such an incoherent way that it's the 

2804
02:15:35,351 --> 02:15:36,460
functional equivalent of line.

2805
02:15:36,470 --> 02:15:38,890
I mean someone who becomes totally 
unpredictable.

2806
02:15:38,930 --> 02:15:43,930
He has a stance that is a on Tuesday and
it'll be on Wednesday and when the 

2807
02:15:44,291 --> 02:15:47,500
discrepancy is pointed out,
he tells her to go fuck yourself.

2808
02:15:47,501 --> 02:15:48,090
Right?
So it's just.

2809
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:52,570
No,
there is no accountability to his,

2810
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:55,930
his own states of consciousness that 
he's going to be held to.

2811
02:15:56,410 --> 02:15:59,740
And the people who love him don't seem 
to care.

2812
02:15:59,741 --> 02:16:02,140
They actually in it,
as far as I can tell,

2813
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:04,750
I don't know so many of these people 
personally,

2814
02:16:04,751 --> 02:16:06,110
but from based on,
you know,

2815
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:11,790
social media and seeing the few articles
where someone has explained why they 

2816
02:16:11,790 --> 02:16:15,991
love trump.
People view this as a kind of this sort 

2817
02:16:16,361 --> 02:16:21,130
of this dishonesty what is on,
in my view,

2818
02:16:21,190 --> 02:16:26,190
both dishonesty and a kind of a kind of 
theatrical hucksterism of person who's,

2819
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:31,480
who's pretending to be many things that 
he probably isn't.

2820
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:34,870
They see it as a new kind of 
authenticity,

2821
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:35,830
right?
Like this guy,

2822
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:38,420
he's just letting it rip.
He doesn't care what is,

2823
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:43,560
what is true.
He doesn't care what your expectations 

2824
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:45,901
for coherence are.
He's just going to tell you to fuck 

2825
02:16:45,901 --> 02:16:48,400
yourself every which way.
And this is the new way of being honest,

2826
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:51,760
right?
This is a new form of integrity.

2827
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:55,870
It's amazing to watch.
It's getting has been.

2828
02:16:55,910 --> 02:16:58,360
I'm someone who actually,
I remember on my own podcast,

2829
02:16:58,361 --> 02:17:02,170
I think I was talking to Paul Bloom,
this gal psychologist,

2830
02:17:02,171 --> 02:17:05,070
who's,
who's great and we had taught.

2831
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:07,300
We got into politics and this is at 
least a year ago,

2832
02:17:07,301 --> 02:17:12,301
but at that point I said there's no way 
we're going to be talking about trump 

2833
02:17:12,301 --> 02:17:12,301
and a year.
I mean,

2834
02:17:12,301 --> 02:17:13,420
this is kind of completely flame out and
I was,

2835
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:16,000
this is a,
I don't tend to make predictions,

2836
02:17:16,001 --> 02:17:19,090
but this was a clear moment that I 
remember making a prediction,

2837
02:17:19,091 --> 02:17:21,710
which is now obviously false.
Um,

2838
02:17:21,850 --> 02:17:26,850
but I just couldn't imagine it,
that this was this when people were 

2839
02:17:26,850 --> 02:17:27,960
going to find this compelling enough to,
for,

2840
02:17:28,090 --> 02:17:31,160
for him to be on the,
on the cusp of getting elected.

2841
02:17:31,161 --> 02:17:33,490
It's,
it is terrifying.

2842
02:17:33,550 --> 02:17:38,550
Have you talked,
have you talked to this issue to death 

2843
02:17:38,550 --> 02:17:38,550
on your podcast?
Or.

2844
02:17:38,550 --> 02:17:38,550
I guess we kind of have.
Well,

2845
02:17:38,550 --> 02:17:40,180
I think this is how everybody feels.

2846
02:17:40,710 --> 02:17:44,250
Everybody feels like you're supposed to 
be like with their person,

2847
02:17:44,520 --> 02:17:49,520
whether it's Bernie or whether it's for 
Hillary or whether you're a trump 

2848
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:49,890
supporter or whatever it is.
Like you have to be all in.

2849
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:53,460
But like if you look at the choices that
we're given,

2850
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:58,680
the.
None of these kids really be described 

2851
02:17:58,680 --> 02:17:58,680
as ideal.
Like Hillary Clinton.

2852
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:00,510
You could want a woman in the White 
House and you want to,

2853
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:05,860
you want to show everyone that a woman 
can do that job just as well as a man 

2854
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:09,121
and she's got the most experienced and 
she certainly has the most experience 

2855
02:18:09,121 --> 02:18:12,141
dealing with foreign governments and she
certainly has the most experience in 

2856
02:18:12,141 --> 02:18:12,160
politics,
can make an easy a,

2857
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:15,340
but she's also involved in to criminal 
investigations.

2858
02:18:15,341 --> 02:18:20,341
She had an observer in her bathroom.
This is squirrely stuff going on like,

2859
02:18:22,010 --> 02:18:22,430
no,
she's.

2860
02:18:22,470 --> 02:18:24,510
She's terrible in.
Anyways,

2861
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:26,960
she was gay marriage,
Oh,

2862
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:30,540
2013 and then wouldn't admit the change 
of mind either.

2863
02:18:31,650 --> 02:18:34,560
She's a politician,
she's probably a brilliant woman,

2864
02:18:34,590 --> 02:18:37,590
but she's also set in her ways and a 
politician,

2865
02:18:37,630 --> 02:18:42,630
a politician to the end and part of 
being a politician is being a fucking 

2866
02:18:42,630 --> 02:18:46,551
huckster.
You got to be able to get those people 

2867
02:18:46,551 --> 02:18:49,221
to see your side and the way you do that
is to talk like this.

2868
02:18:50,550 --> 02:18:52,890
You can't talk like a normal person 
needs a speech coach.

2869
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:55,280
They all do.
He's terrible to.

2870
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:57,870
Trump's not even good at it and he kicks
their asses.

2871
02:18:57,940 --> 02:18:58,590
I know,
but who knows,

2872
02:18:58,591 --> 02:19:03,591
but her voice or she,
she has a kind of to use the sexist 

2873
02:19:03,591 --> 02:19:03,810
trope.
She has a

2874
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:09,120
real for when you were,
when you get her in front of a mic and 

2875
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:10,110
there's a crowd and she thinks she's 
talking over the crowd,

2876
02:19:10,111 --> 02:19:12,060
which she doesn't have to do because 
she's in front of a mic.

2877
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:15,360
The sound you get is just,
it's,

2878
02:19:15,470 --> 02:19:20,470
it's,
she's yelling when she doesn't need to 

2879
02:19:20,470 --> 02:19:22,761
yell at someone.
Someone has to teach her how to dial 

2880
02:19:22,761 --> 02:19:22,761
that back.

2881
02:19:22,761 --> 02:19:23,280
What you just did is called 
mansplaining.

2882
02:19:25,270 --> 02:19:27,370
I'm explaining to the men in her who 
should,

2883
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:27,710
who should

2884
02:19:28,970 --> 02:19:31,610
talk some sense into her,
but she is,

2885
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:33,500
she's a,
she's a bad candidate,

2886
02:19:33,590 --> 02:19:38,590
right?
I have no doubt that she's very smart 

2887
02:19:38,590 --> 02:19:41,411
and she is well informed and she's 
qualified and she is absolutely who I 

2888
02:19:41,411 --> 02:19:45,140
will vote for given the choices.
But you know,

2889
02:19:45,141 --> 02:19:47,900
I totally understand people's 
reservations with her.

2890
02:19:47,901 --> 02:19:49,880
She's a liar.
She's an opportunist.

2891
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:54,200
She's just almost preternaturally and 
authentic.

2892
02:19:54,201 --> 02:19:55,100
I mean,
she's just like,

2893
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:59,540
she will just focus group every third 
sentence and you feel that from her.

2894
02:19:59,541 --> 02:20:00,470
Right?
And,

2895
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:06,220
and this is all true,
and yet I also believe that people who 

2896
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:06,800
say I've never met her,
but people who know her and have met her

2897
02:20:06,801 --> 02:20:08,480
say behind closed doors,
you know,

2898
02:20:08,481 --> 02:20:12,200
one on one,
she's incredibly impressive and great.

2899
02:20:12,810 --> 02:20:17,810
Um,
but that doesn't translate into her 

2900
02:20:17,810 --> 02:20:17,810
candidacy.
She probably thinks she has to do it.

2901
02:20:17,810 --> 02:20:18,750
Old School,
you know,

2902
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:20,420
I mean,
the way she's doing it,

2903
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:21,530
but she,
I mean,

2904
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:22,610
the thing is,
she's,

2905
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:26,150
when you look at the,
what's worked,

2906
02:20:26,151 --> 02:20:26,690
what worries me?

2907
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:29,360
So I went on facebook the other day and 
I,

2908
02:20:29,390 --> 02:20:34,390
I've said very little about this,
but I've made enough noise is of the 

2909
02:20:34,390 --> 02:20:35,180
sort that I just made,
that people understand that I've,

2910
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:38,810
that I'm for Clinton,
despite all my reservations about her.

2911
02:20:39,310 --> 02:20:44,210
Um,
and when I got on my own facebook page,

2912
02:20:44,211 --> 02:20:49,211
which you have to assume is filtered by 
the people who are following me on 

2913
02:20:49,211 --> 02:20:49,670
facebook.
And I already liked me in some sense,

2914
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:54,080
just like a thousand comments of pure 
pain.

2915
02:20:54,081 --> 02:20:55,430
I mean,
no one loves hillary.

2916
02:20:55,431 --> 02:20:56,330
No one,
no one said,

2917
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:58,460
oh,
thank God someone's someone smart is for

2918
02:20:58,461 --> 02:20:59,590
Hillary.
Um,

2919
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:04,530
it was all just Bernie people and trump 
people flaming me for,

2920
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:09,610
for,
for the most tepid possible endorsement 

2921
02:21:09,610 --> 02:21:09,610
of Clinton.
All I said was,

2922
02:21:10,190 --> 02:21:13,850
listen,
I understand Clinton's a liar and she's,

2923
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:16,700
and she's an opportunist and she's,
um,

2924
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:19,640
I,
I completely get your reservations about

2925
02:21:19,641 --> 02:21:21,950
her,
but at least she's a grownup,

2926
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:22,280
right?

2927
02:21:22,310 --> 02:21:27,310
And she's going to be the candidate.
It's not going to be sanders for the 

2928
02:21:27,531 --> 02:21:32,531
moment.
Now is the moment to put your political 

2929
02:21:32,531 --> 02:21:33,710
idealism behind you.
If you're a sanders person and recognize

2930
02:21:33,711 --> 02:21:36,980
that there's a vast difference between 
Clinton and trump and no itch.

2931
02:21:37,010 --> 02:21:38,390
No,
she's not going to change the system,

2932
02:21:38,391 --> 02:21:40,670
but he's also not going to run 
civilization off a cliff.

2933
02:21:40,740 --> 02:21:43,100
Right?
And I didn't,

2934
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:45,800
I forget how I said it on facebook,
but it was just the most,

2935
02:21:45,801 --> 02:21:50,801
it was just,
it really was a lesser of two evils 

2936
02:21:50,801 --> 02:21:51,020
argument.
And it just,

2937
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:52,010
it was,
um,

2938
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:56,930
it's amazing to see how energized and 
passionate people are in defensive trump

2939
02:21:57,020 --> 02:22:02,020
and sanders.
And there's almost none of that for 

2940
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:04,901
Clinton.
It's like people are just sheepishly 

2941
02:22:04,901 --> 02:22:06,080
saying that they just divulging that 
they will vote for Clinton,

2942
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:10,730
but they are may.
Maybe somewhere that I haven't noticed.

2943
02:22:10,731 --> 02:22:12,920
Someone loves absolutely loves Clinton,
but it's just,

2944
02:22:12,921 --> 02:22:17,921
it's.
She does not have her defenders the way 

2945
02:22:17,921 --> 02:22:17,921
these guys do.
Have you seen the man enough to vote for

2946
02:22:17,921 --> 02:22:19,100
her campaign?
No.

2947
02:22:19,160 --> 02:22:24,160
No.
It's with like hipster dudes with 

2948
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:24,160
tattoos and beards that are going to 
vote for Hillary.

2949
02:22:24,320 --> 02:22:25,770
No,
I hope it's fake

2950
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:28,530
because it's so brilliant.
I hope it's not real.

2951
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:32,810
Is it fake?
Is it God?

2952
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:36,570
It's so good though because it's not 
that fake.

2953
02:22:37,470 --> 02:22:40,290
It's pretty good.
Like you could almost see.

2954
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:46,440
So wait a minute.
I mean this is not for her,

2955
02:22:46,441 --> 02:22:47,040
right?
This is.

2956
02:22:47,050 --> 02:22:47,910
No,
no,

2957
02:22:47,911 --> 02:22:49,710
no.
It's not bad for just funny.

2958
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:54,300
If someone would like make a joke,
political ad,

2959
02:22:54,530 --> 02:22:57,440
you know that you have to be man enough 
to vote for Hillary was like,

2960
02:22:57,450 --> 02:22:59,220
there's guys out there that would buy 
that.

2961
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:00,540
They would.
They would,

2962
02:23:02,190 --> 02:23:07,190
they'd do it.
It's a scary time because it doesn't 

2963
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:11,631
seem like anybody that you would want to
be president wants to be president and 

2964
02:23:11,631 --> 02:23:12,930
so we're left with,
all right,

2965
02:23:12,931 --> 02:23:17,931
what do you pick?
It's like as if we're going to play the 

2966
02:23:17,931 --> 02:23:18,390
super bowl with three of the shittiest 
teams we can find.

2967
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:21,000
We're just going to go get some drunk 
high school kids,

2968
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:26,180
get some inmates with club feet,
which is going to throw whoever we're 

2969
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:27,480
going to have the worst game ever and 
this was what this game is.

2970
02:23:27,481 --> 02:23:30,690
It's not a good game.
This is not a game where you've got like

2971
02:23:31,050 --> 02:23:35,370
a John F Kennedy versus a Lyndon Johnson
or it's not.

2972
02:23:35,420 --> 02:23:40,420
It's not like like powerful characters.
It's trump I guess is a really powerful 

2973
02:23:41,761 --> 02:23:46,761
character,
but in more ways like a showman 

2974
02:23:46,761 --> 02:23:47,610
character,
like what what he's doing.

2975
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:52,940
He's like,
he's putting on a great show and he's 

2976
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:56,050
going to win probably because he's 
putting on such a great show and people 

2977
02:23:56,050 --> 02:23:57,670
like a great show,
but I do think.

2978
02:23:57,670 --> 02:23:57,860
I think

2979
02:23:57,860 --> 02:24:02,860
I'm now have among the people who think 
something new witnessed were witnessing 

2980
02:24:03,141 --> 02:24:08,141
something new with trump.
It's not just the same old thing where 

2981
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:13,870
the process is so onerous that it's 
selecting for the kind of narcissist or 

2982
02:24:15,770 --> 02:24:19,250
thick skin person who is willing to 
submit to the process.

2983
02:24:19,251 --> 02:24:24,251
And then there are many,
most of the good people just aren't 

2984
02:24:24,251 --> 02:24:24,251
going to put up with this.
I mean,

2985
02:24:24,251 --> 02:24:25,070
yes,
there's that too.

2986
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:27,350
But there's,
um,

2987
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:28,950
there's something,
there's a,

2988
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:34,450
it's a moment among the electorate where
it's like,

2989
02:24:35,410 --> 02:24:37,070
it's fun.
It's an antistatic.

2990
02:24:37,090 --> 02:24:42,090
There's an ant,
there's enough of an antiestablishment 

2991
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:45,520
mood and vote now is it happening with,
with sanders to where people just want 

2992
02:24:47,601 --> 02:24:52,550
to jam a stick in the wheel of the 
system just to see what happens.

2993
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:53,150
So it's like,
well,

2994
02:24:53,210 --> 02:24:58,210
this is the main gripe against Hillary 
really is that she is politics as usual.

2995
02:24:59,030 --> 02:25:00,930
She's not going to change the system,
right?

2996
02:25:01,430 --> 02:25:06,430
People want to change the system,
but they're not really thinking about 

2997
02:25:06,430 --> 02:25:07,070
the implications of radically changing 
the system.

2998
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:10,630
And in the case of trump,
um,

2999
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:16,540
I may hear or someone who is,
who was advertising his lack of 

3000
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:20,000
qualifications for the office in every 
way that he can.

3001
02:25:20,070 --> 02:25:20,730
It's like he,
like,

3002
02:25:21,730 --> 02:25:23,670
there is no,
I mean,

3003
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:28,680
I'm not even,
I'm not even bothered by his racism or 

3004
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:31,000
his misogyny or his demagoguery or his 
bully.

3005
02:25:31,001 --> 02:25:36,001
I mean,
all of that I'm willing to to guess is 

3006
02:25:36,001 --> 02:25:39,721
an act right.
That he's decided that that's somehow 

3007
02:25:39,721 --> 02:25:40,780
pandering his base and he's actually,
in truth,

3008
02:25:40,781 --> 02:25:42,430
he doesn't have a racist bone in his 
body.

3009
02:25:42,431 --> 02:25:45,390
Say I'm willing to,
to believe that amount.

3010
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:47,740
I don't know why I would think that's 
plausible,

3011
02:25:47,741 --> 02:25:48,660
but it's,
it's,

3012
02:25:49,410 --> 02:25:49,690
it's,
uh,

3013
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:55,190
you know,
I have a hunch that he's far more 

3014
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:55,190
liberal than he seems and it's just 
pandering.

3015
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:57,410
But the thing that,
that,

3016
02:25:57,411 --> 02:26:02,411
um,
can't be true is there's no way he's 

3017
02:26:03,221 --> 02:26:08,221
actually brilliant and well informed 
about all the issues and is saying the 

3018
02:26:08,891 --> 02:26:13,891
things he's saying.
He's not pretending to be as uninformed 

3019
02:26:13,891 --> 02:26:16,300
and as incoherent and as irresponsible 
as he's seeming.

3020
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:21,860
Um,
because you wouldn't withhold 

3021
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:21,860
information.
It will make you a better leader.

3022
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:21,860
Well,
it's just,

3023
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:22,240
it's.
Yeah.

3024
02:26:22,241 --> 02:26:22,720
And it's just,
well,

3025
02:26:22,721 --> 02:26:25,060
it's just the vacuous snus of his 
speech.

3026
02:26:25,061 --> 02:26:30,061
It's like he's,
he'll say that he'll say the same thing 

3027
02:26:30,061 --> 02:26:32,320
three times in a row.
And it was meaningless the first time,

3028
02:26:32,530 --> 02:26:33,280
right?
He'll say,

3029
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:35,290
it's going to be amazing.
It's going to be very,

3030
02:26:35,291 --> 02:26:36,520
very amazing.
Trust me,

3031
02:26:36,521 --> 02:26:38,200
it's going to be so amazing.
And he does.

3032
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:43,230
He does this with everything.
If you look at the transcripts of his 

3033
02:26:43,230 --> 02:26:46,201
speeches and the fact that he can't,
he has never met so far as I've seen.

3034
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:53,880
He has never once strung together a 
string of sentences that was even 

3035
02:26:56,381 --> 02:26:57,220
interesting.
Right?

3036
02:26:57,221 --> 02:26:58,140
But he'd be like,
he's,

3037
02:26:58,310 --> 02:26:59,800
he's never.
He just,

3038
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:03,160
there's never a moment where I read or I
say,

3039
02:27:03,190 --> 02:27:08,190
Oh,
this guy is smarter and better informed 

3040
02:27:08,190 --> 02:27:11,730
than I realized at that moment.
Never comes where I keep expecting to 

3041
02:27:11,730 --> 02:27:11,730
see that happen.
Um,

3042
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:17,640
and it's a little bit like my head is 
this image of like imagine you have an 

3043
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:17,640
urn,
right?

3044
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:20,940
And you just keep pulling things out of 
it and all you pull out of it as junk,

3045
02:27:20,950 --> 02:27:21,300
right.
You know,

3046
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:21,900
you pull,
you know,

3047
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:25,000
chicken bones and broken marbles and gum
and,

3048
02:27:25,480 --> 02:27:29,530
and it's,
it's still possible that you,

3049
02:27:29,650 --> 02:27:31,510
that if you root around in that earn 
long enough,

3050
02:27:31,511 --> 02:27:33,030
you're going to find the hope diamond.
I mean,

3051
02:27:33,031 --> 02:27:38,031
in each round that you pull something 
out that really has no logical 

3052
02:27:38,031 --> 02:27:40,150
implication for the next thing you might
pull out of the earn,

3053
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:43,750
but mines aren't like that when I see 
what this guy says,

3054
02:27:43,751 --> 02:27:47,290
he does not say anything that a well 
informed,

3055
02:27:47,291 --> 02:27:49,120
intelligent person would say.

3056
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:49,780
And it's just.
And,

3057
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:51,410
and ideas are connected,
right?

3058
02:27:51,411 --> 02:27:53,050
It's like you can't,
um,

3059
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:56,400
you can't fake this stuff.
You can't fake,

3060
02:27:56,450 --> 02:28:01,210
you can't fake being this,
this uninformed and you can't fake being

3061
02:28:01,240 --> 02:28:03,700
really well informed and he's just,
I mean,

3062
02:28:03,701 --> 02:28:06,460
we just look at one policy that he wants
a,

3063
02:28:06,490 --> 02:28:07,590
the,
the um,

3064
02:28:08,610 --> 02:28:09,060
uh,
you know,

3065
02:28:09,061 --> 02:28:12,610
the rounding up of illegal aliens,
right around 11 million illegal aliens.

3066
02:28:12,670 --> 02:28:14,620
Now this,
this gets stated as,

3067
02:28:14,621 --> 02:28:19,621
yeah,
we're going to round them up and send 

3068
02:28:19,621 --> 02:28:21,061
them back to Mexico.
And what worries me is no one seems to 

3069
02:28:21,141 --> 02:28:26,141
care about that.
If you just look at the implications of 

3070
02:28:26,141 --> 02:28:28,010
doing this,
it has this one policy.

3071
02:28:28,011 --> 02:28:32,210
Claim alone is so impractical and 
unethical.

3072
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:35,450
It's just,
what are we talking about here?

3073
02:28:35,451 --> 02:28:39,290
You're talking like your gardener,
your housekeeper or the person who works

3074
02:28:39,291 --> 02:28:42,020
at the carwash.
The person who picks the vegetables that

3075
02:28:42,021 --> 02:28:47,021
you buy in the market is going to get a 
knock on the door in the middle of the 

3076
02:28:47,021 --> 02:28:49,760
night by the Gestapo and get sent back 
to.

3077
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:52,620
The vast majority of these people are,
are,

3078
02:28:52,630 --> 02:28:57,630
are law abiding.
People are just working at jobs that 

3079
02:28:57,630 --> 02:29:00,730
Americans by and large don't want to do.
And many of them have kids who were 

3080
02:29:01,281 --> 02:29:02,340
American citizens,
right?

3081
02:29:02,341 --> 02:29:07,341
And somebody to say someone's got kids 
under the age of 10 who are American 

3082
02:29:07,341 --> 02:29:10,511
citizens and what you're going to send 
that person back to Mexico and you're 

3083
02:29:10,511 --> 02:29:11,930
going to do this by the hundreds of 
thousands and millions.

3084
02:29:12,470 --> 02:29:17,470
It's just that one point alone held in 
isolation from all of the other things 

3085
02:29:19,401 --> 02:29:24,401
he said.
The crazy things like climate change is 

3086
02:29:24,401 --> 02:29:25,460
a hoax concocted by the Chinese to 
destroy our manufacturing base.

3087
02:29:25,461 --> 02:29:26,490
And,
um,

3088
02:29:26,510 --> 02:29:26,840
you know,
the,

3089
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:28,330
the fact that he likes Putin,
I mean,

3090
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:31,400
everything else he said,
write this one policy.

3091
02:29:31,401 --> 02:29:35,150
Claim alone should be enough to 
disqualify a person's candidacy.

3092
02:29:35,151 --> 02:29:38,210
It's so crazy with the moment you,
you look at it,

3093
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:41,150
um,
and yet no one seems to care.

3094
02:29:41,150 --> 02:29:42,160
In fact,
it's just,

3095
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:45,680
it's just more energizing to the people 
who already like it.

3096
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:48,170
I know that he said that he wanted to 
build a wall,

3097
02:29:48,171 --> 02:29:51,830
but I didn't know that said that he 
wanted to get rid of the illegal aliens,

3098
02:29:51,831 --> 02:29:54,980
round them up and around them up and do 
one with them,

3099
02:29:55,650 --> 02:29:58,550
send them back to their country.
It's so crazy.

3100
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:00,830
It's such a crazy idea and it's so 
brutal.

3101
02:30:01,010 --> 02:30:02,360
The idea that.
I mean,

3102
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:04,400
it's like a,
it's a sub human thing.

3103
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:09,440
The only reason why people would come to
America is because they felt they felt 

3104
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:10,400
like it would make their life better.
So people take a big risk.

3105
02:30:10,401 --> 02:30:12,380
It's not,
there's not an easy way to do it.

3106
02:30:12,381 --> 02:30:17,381
If you're poor,
you don't have any qualifications for 

3107
02:30:17,381 --> 02:30:20,621
any unusual job.
I mean you're trying to get across to 

3108
02:30:20,621 --> 02:30:23,621
Mexico,
but everybody who does it does it 

3109
02:30:23,621 --> 02:30:23,621
because they want to improve their life.

3110
02:30:23,621 --> 02:30:27,220
You know,
and the idea that one group of people 

3111
02:30:27,220 --> 02:30:29,081
shouldn't be able to do it in one group 
should just because they were born on 

3112
02:30:29,081 --> 02:30:31,721
the right side of some strange line that
is only a couple hundred years old,

3113
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:32,990
but I actually,
no,

3114
02:30:32,991 --> 02:30:36,590
I'll go further in meeting him in the 
middle.

3115
02:30:36,591 --> 02:30:37,070
Whereas.
So,

3116
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:39,380
so I think we should be able to defend 
our borders.

3117
02:30:39,410 --> 02:30:40,520
Right?
So it is.

3118
02:30:40,910 --> 02:30:45,910
I don't have a good argument for having 
a porous border that we can't figure out

3119
02:30:46,041 --> 02:30:48,170
how to defend and we don't know who's 
coming into the country.

3120
02:30:48,190 --> 02:30:48,470
Right.
So,

3121
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:53,650
so I think building the wall is almost 
certainly a stupid idea among his many 

3122
02:30:53,650 --> 02:30:58,151
stupid ideas,
but I think it would be great to know 

3123
02:30:58,151 --> 02:30:59,140
who's coming into the country and have 
a,

3124
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:02,270
a purely legal process by which that 
happened.

3125
02:31:02,271 --> 02:31:04,130
I mean,
ultimately that's got to be the goal,

3126
02:31:04,131 --> 02:31:05,490
right?
Um,

3127
02:31:05,570 --> 02:31:09,470
and we are in perfectly doing that.

3128
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:14,530
And um,
so I don't have an argument for open 

3129
02:31:14,530 --> 02:31:17,711
borders or porous borders,
but the question is what do you do with 

3130
02:31:17,711 --> 02:31:21,770
11 or 12 million people who are already 
doing jobs we want them to do that help 

3131
02:31:22,201 --> 02:31:27,201
our society and the vast majority of 
them are law abiding people who as you 

3132
02:31:27,451 --> 02:31:29,550
say,
or just trying to have better lives,

3133
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:35,720
the idea that you're going to break up 
families and send people back by the 

3134
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:38,430
millions and the idea that you're going 
to devote your law enforcement resources

3135
02:31:38,431 --> 02:31:42,750
to doing this when you have real 
terrorism and real crime to,

3136
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:46,350
to,
to deal with is just pure insanity.

3137
02:31:46,530 --> 02:31:47,520
Right?
And,

3138
02:31:48,330 --> 02:31:53,330
and also totally unethical and yet he 
doesn't get any points docked for this 

3139
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:56,550
aspiration.
I mean,

3140
02:31:56,551 --> 02:32:01,551
it's just,
it's one of the things around which 

3141
02:32:01,551 --> 02:32:03,531
people are rallying.
But the climate change thing is also 

3142
02:32:03,531 --> 02:32:03,640
insane and dangerous.

3143
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:05,610
He was a birther,
right?

3144
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:06,330
Yeah,
right.

3145
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:11,360
He was one of the original birthers.
He was saying that Obama's birth 

3146
02:32:11,360 --> 02:32:12,600
certificate was bullshit and he was born
in Kenya,

3147
02:32:12,601 --> 02:32:13,920
right?
Wasn't he one of those guys?

3148
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:15,150
Oh yeah,
he was,

3149
02:32:15,210 --> 02:32:16,110
he was.
Um,

3150
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:18,430
I would love it if funding that for 
awhile.

3151
02:32:18,450 --> 02:32:23,450
Yeah,
I would love to if he got in the office 

3152
02:32:23,450 --> 02:32:23,450
and just said,
listen folks,

3153
02:32:23,450 --> 02:32:26,490
I am nothing like this person.
I pretended to be to win the presidency.

3154
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:30,270
I just wanted to show you that you can 
be manipulated and get it together.

3155
02:32:30,850 --> 02:32:35,850
Then peaches,
punk to all going to hire some people 

3156
02:32:35,850 --> 02:32:36,840
who actually know how to run things and 
we'll see.

3157
02:32:36,841 --> 02:32:38,470
That's the,
the,

3158
02:32:38,510 --> 02:32:41,400
the smart people who are voting for him 
think.

3159
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:43,270
And this is,
I think an actual,

3160
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:48,590
a crazy position.
But they think that he is just pandering

3161
02:32:49,410 --> 02:32:53,790
to the idiots who he needs to pander to 
to get into office.

3162
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:58,790
So He's,
he's not disavowing the white 

3163
02:32:58,790 --> 02:33:02,361
supremacists votes with the,
the Alacrity that you would if you were 

3164
02:33:02,361 --> 02:33:04,590
a decent human being and you found out 
that David Dukes who supported you,

3165
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:06,230
um,
uh,

3166
02:33:06,270 --> 02:33:07,710
because he needs to.
He just,

3167
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:12,800
he needs those votes and he knows that,
that most of the people in his base 

3168
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:15,870
aren't going to care and he can just 
kind of move on in the news cycle.

3169
02:33:16,890 --> 02:33:21,090
And he's doing this on all these issues.
Where he looked,

3170
02:33:21,380 --> 02:33:25,360
where smart people see that he looks 
like a buffoon and,

3171
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:27,560
and,
and they are treating him as a,

3172
02:33:27,570 --> 02:33:32,570
the people who don't like him or 
treating him as a comic figure who he 

3173
02:33:32,570 --> 02:33:34,050
can't really believe that stuff.
He's not really,

3174
02:33:34,051 --> 02:33:35,990
he's too sophisticated to really believe
that stuff.

3175
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,020
So He's just pandering.
Um,

3176
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:43,760
I mean,
one is that people aren't seeing if 

3177
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:46,881
that's true,
just how unethical and weird that is 

3178
02:33:46,881 --> 02:33:46,881
right here.

3179
02:33:46,881 --> 02:33:48,700
The guy has no compunction about lying 
and demonizing people.

3180
02:33:48,701 --> 02:33:49,000
It's like,
well,

3181
02:33:49,010 --> 02:33:54,010
let's say he,
let's say he thinks that that Clinton 

3182
02:33:54,010 --> 02:33:55,930
really isn't guilty,
but Bill Clinton isn't really guilty of,

3183
02:33:55,940 --> 02:33:57,390
of a rape.
Right?

3184
02:33:57,391 --> 02:33:58,890
And now he's calling him a rapist.
Right now,

3185
02:33:58,891 --> 02:34:02,850
at the time he was saying he wasn't a 
rapist and he's just being defamed.

3186
02:34:02,851 --> 02:34:04,160
And this is outrageous.
He was taking,

3187
02:34:04,161 --> 02:34:05,780
he was taking the side of a friend who,
you know,

3188
02:34:05,850 --> 02:34:09,390
he invited to his wedding,
but now he's,

3189
02:34:09,570 --> 02:34:11,160
he's calling him a rapist,
right?

3190
02:34:11,161 --> 02:34:16,161
A sexual Predator who's,
who've harmed women's rights more than 

3191
02:34:16,161 --> 02:34:16,190
anyone.
I'm so,

3192
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:17,070
which is true,
right?

3193
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:22,110
So there's,
there's no version of the truth here 

3194
02:34:22,110 --> 02:34:24,190
that makes trump look at all acceptable 
as a person.

3195
02:34:24,191 --> 02:34:29,191
It's like either he knew he was a rapist
and was defending him because he was 

3196
02:34:29,591 --> 02:34:31,870
just cozying up to power at that point,
right.

3197
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:35,530
Didn't care that he's a rapist or now 
he,

3198
02:34:35,830 --> 02:34:40,830
he knows he still,
he's still the guy who thinks he wasn't 

3199
02:34:40,830 --> 02:34:43,891
a rapist,
but now he's just for purely 

3200
02:34:43,891 --> 02:34:43,891
opportunistic reasons.
He's,

3201
02:34:43,891 --> 02:34:47,880
he's,
he's willing to call a guy a rapist who 

3202
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:47,880
he knows isn't,
um,

3203
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:48,340
they're both horrible.
Right?

3204
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:53,880
And it's not like there's new evidence 
has come forward in the intervening 

3205
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:55,450
years that would have changed his mind 
about what happened in,

3206
02:34:55,470 --> 02:34:58,930
in Clinton's presidency.
So he's um,

3207
02:34:59,850 --> 02:35:04,850
uh,
but I think people think that he's got 

3208
02:35:04,850 --> 02:35:08,531
to be much more sophisticated than he is
and that if he got into office,

3209
02:35:09,430 --> 02:35:12,910
he would just be a totally sober and 
presidential person.

3210
02:35:13,570 --> 02:35:18,570
There's just no reason to believe that.
I mean that if he thinks climate change 

3211
02:35:18,570 --> 02:35:20,470
is a hoax and that we should pull out of
the Paris accord,

3212
02:35:20,471 --> 02:35:24,340
then we should ramp up coal production 
and when to bring back the coal jobs.

3213
02:35:24,341 --> 02:35:25,360
I mean,
this is what he's saying,

3214
02:35:25,361 --> 02:35:30,361
right?
There is no reason to think he doesn't 

3215
02:35:30,361 --> 02:35:30,361
believe this at this point.
Um,

3216
02:35:31,150 --> 02:35:35,440
that's just,
it is a disastrous thing for a president

3217
02:35:35,441 --> 02:35:38,020
to think.
The only,

3218
02:35:38,021 --> 02:35:38,590
um,

3219
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:43,900
fascinating versions of this that I've 
been hearing from people that I respect 

3220
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:47,350
are that the idea that he is like,
uh,

3221
02:35:48,110 --> 02:35:50,750
the political version of the asteroid 
that killed the dinosaurs.

3222
02:35:50,990 --> 02:35:55,990
Like he's going to come down and smash 
it and it's going to be so chaotic that 

3223
02:35:55,990 --> 02:35:59,771
they're going to be forced to reform the
system and people are going to respond 

3224
02:35:59,771 --> 02:36:03,011
in turn,
like the way people responding against 

3225
02:36:03,011 --> 02:36:03,011
factory farming and more people are 
going Vegan,

3226
02:36:03,011 --> 02:36:07,481
like that kind of thing.
They're going to see it and they get to 

3227
02:36:07,481 --> 02:36:09,221
respond in turn that has such a.
So it's like he's going to toss the 

3228
02:36:09,490 --> 02:36:11,990
applecart up in the air.
It's just going to fuck this whole goofy

3229
02:36:11,991 --> 02:36:16,991
system up.
And then we'll be able to rebuild after 

3230
02:36:16,991 --> 02:36:19,511
trump has dismantled all the,
all the different special interest 

3231
02:36:19,511 --> 02:36:22,931
groups and lobbyists and all the people 
that we really would like to get out of 

3232
02:36:22,931 --> 02:36:22,931
the system.

3233
02:36:22,931 --> 02:36:22,980
We really don't like the.
The.

3234
02:36:22,981 --> 02:36:27,981
The fact that they're such insane 
amounts of influence that big 

3235
02:36:27,981 --> 02:36:29,840
corporations and lobbyists have had on 
the way.

3236
02:36:29,841 --> 02:36:32,780
Laws get passed that.
This might be the way to do it.

3237
02:36:32,990 --> 02:36:35,330
You have some wild man.
Everyone's fired.

3238
02:36:35,331 --> 02:36:37,580
You have fired.
You have fire Jetson.

3239
02:36:37,910 --> 02:36:39,860
It's like a character.
Like he's coming in.

3240
02:36:39,861 --> 02:36:43,370
His hair's plastic is all fired up.
He's a billionaire.

3241
02:36:43,371 --> 02:36:44,870
He made all his own money,
sort of.

3242
02:36:44,930 --> 02:36:47,360
Dad gave him some money,
but he turned it into a lot of money.

3243
02:36:47,590 --> 02:36:48,870
Point being,
he doesn't need anybody to.

3244
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:51,170
My truth is he's probably lying about 
the amount of money has to.

3245
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:54,410
Is He is,
but he's a baller for sure though,

3246
02:36:54,470 --> 02:36:55,820
right?
At the very least,

3247
02:36:55,850 --> 02:36:58,460
he's got to be worth some cash.
Yeah.

3248
02:36:58,490 --> 02:37:03,490
I made.
It could be a big difference between 

3249
02:37:03,490 --> 02:37:03,490
what he's claiming and what is in fact 
true.

3250
02:37:03,490 --> 02:37:05,360
But he's.
He's a many pieces here.

3251
02:37:05,380 --> 02:37:08,210
When people assume that because he's a 
successful businessman,

3252
02:37:08,570 --> 02:37:10,450
he must understand the economy,
right?

3253
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:12,770
Which is no necessary connection there,
right?

3254
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:17,570
There's a lot of rich who are totally 
confused about economics.

3255
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:19,240
Um,
and uh,

3256
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:24,300
you know,
most economists don't have a lot of 

3257
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:24,300
money,
so there's no real connection there.

3258
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:24,300
But the,

3259
02:37:25,820 --> 02:37:26,570
the uh,

3260
02:37:28,130 --> 02:37:33,130
I mean,
so what you're describing is a kind of 

3261
02:37:33,130 --> 02:37:33,130
just random,
like,

3262
02:37:33,130 --> 02:37:33,130
like you're just,
let's just,

3263
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:36,760
let's just smash the window and then see
what happens.

3264
02:37:36,761 --> 02:37:41,761
Right?
Like I'm going to light a fire to this 

3265
02:37:41,761 --> 02:37:41,761
place and see what happens.
And that's,

3266
02:37:41,950 --> 02:37:42,610
um,

3267
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:50,450
it almost any process by which you would
change the system is more intelligent 

3268
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:50,640
than that,
you know,

3269
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:53,370
and,
and it's also not value in how much harm

3270
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:57,140
one bad president could do,
right?

3271
02:37:57,210 --> 02:37:57,840
Like,
there's no,

3272
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:01,110
I think even,
I haven't tested this,

3273
02:38:01,111 --> 02:38:06,111
but I'm imagining that even trump 
supporters would answer this question 

3274
02:38:06,111 --> 02:38:09,591
the way I would hope,
which is like if I had a crystal ball 

3275
02:38:09,591 --> 02:38:14,390
that could tell you,
I can't tell you who's going to be 

3276
02:38:14,390 --> 02:38:16,391
president,
but it tells you how it works out for 

3277
02:38:16,391 --> 02:38:16,391
the next president.
So like if I,

3278
02:38:16,391 --> 02:38:19,470
if I look in the crystal ball and it 
says the next president of United States

3279
02:38:20,010 --> 02:38:21,610
is a disaster,
right?

3280
02:38:21,611 --> 02:38:23,400
Just,
it's like the worst president we've ever

3281
02:38:23,401 --> 02:38:25,320
had.
You just think of,

3282
02:38:25,350 --> 02:38:29,760
you know,
just just failures of governance and,

3283
02:38:30,270 --> 02:38:35,270
and the toxic influence of narcissism 
and Hubris that comes along just like 

3284
02:38:35,820 --> 02:38:37,050
once every thousand years.

3285
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:37,500
Right?
Just,

3286
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:40,740
just disaster.
I think,

3287
02:38:40,741 --> 02:38:43,080
you know,
even if you're a trump supporter,

3288
02:38:43,470 --> 02:38:47,210
which candidate that was like only trump
is,

3289
02:38:47,310 --> 02:38:51,690
is likely to screw things up that badly.
It's not a Clinton is going to,

3290
02:38:51,720 --> 02:38:54,930
is going to be almost perfectly 
predictable.

3291
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:57,300
She's going to be a politician.
She's going to,

3292
02:38:57,330 --> 02:39:00,350
she's going to be basically centrist on 
a lot of the,

3293
02:39:00,351 --> 02:39:02,910
on foreign policy and domestic policy.
You know,

3294
02:39:02,911 --> 02:39:05,550
she's going to be liberal on social 
issues.

3295
02:39:06,050 --> 02:39:11,050
Um,
she is not going to try to dismantle 

3296
02:39:12,001 --> 02:39:17,001
NATO and to get into a war with North 
Korea or get into an alliance with Putin

3297
02:39:18,691 --> 02:39:21,690
or image.
She's not going to do something insane.

3298
02:39:22,030 --> 02:39:25,410
Um,
and so alliance with Putin.

3299
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:25,950
Yeah,
he,

3300
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:29,180
he said basically only favorable things 
about Putin.

3301
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:30,900
They're homeless,
they're tight.

3302
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:33,350
So she get get,
uh,

3303
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:38,480
hopefully we'll,
we'll see pictures with both of them on 

3304
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:40,290
horseback,
shirtless and a golf shirt on.

3305
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:45,800
He'll probably keep my shirt on.
I don't see them as being the shirtless 

3306
02:39:45,800 --> 02:39:45,800
guy.
I know.

3307
02:39:46,320 --> 02:39:46,830
Yeah.

3308
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:54,280
When,
when you just look at the landscape 

3309
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:56,370
between Bernie and Hillary in him and 
uh,

3310
02:39:56,700 --> 02:40:01,700
you know,
to me it looks like the last gasps of a 

3311
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:04,731
dying system.
So that's representative government 

3312
02:40:04,731 --> 02:40:08,451
system for a lot of people are saying 
that things like that,

3313
02:40:09,270 --> 02:40:14,270
but they're not hearing just nihilistic.
That is if.

3314
02:40:15,661 --> 02:40:16,500
True.
Right,

3315
02:40:16,530 --> 02:40:17,010
right.
It's like,

3316
02:40:17,011 --> 02:40:17,380
oh,
well we,

3317
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:19,590
there's so much stuff we have to get 
right.

3318
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:23,510
And there's so much.
And the only tool to get it right is,

3319
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:28,670
is having your,
your mind actually understand what's 

3320
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:33,591
going on in the world and how to 
manipulate the world in the direction 

3321
02:40:33,591 --> 02:40:36,530
you want it to go.
So you have to understand like what,

3322
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:41,540
whether or not climate change is true,
your beliefs about it have to be 

3323
02:40:41,540 --> 02:40:43,430
representative of that truth.
Right?

3324
02:40:43,450 --> 02:40:44,640
So like,
if let's say,

3325
02:40:44,740 --> 02:40:45,870
you know,
let's say it's,

3326
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:47,900
let's say I'm mistaken and there's,
you know,

3327
02:40:47,950 --> 02:40:52,950
there is no human caused climate change 
is not a problem and every moment spent 

3328
02:40:53,730 --> 02:40:55,360
thinking about it,
worrying about it,

3329
02:40:55,950 --> 02:40:58,830
correcting for it is just a waste of 
time.

3330
02:40:58,830 --> 02:41:00,670
That's just throwing out,
you know,

3331
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:02,070
the wealth of the world,
right?

3332
02:41:03,330 --> 02:41:05,490
That would be a terrible thing,
right?

3333
02:41:05,491 --> 02:41:10,491
So it really matters who's right about 
that and the fact that we have a 

3334
02:41:10,491 --> 02:41:12,660
president or a candidate who is coming 
in saying,

3335
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:14,640
uh,
this is all bullshit,

3336
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:15,600
you know,
in,

3337
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:19,770
in defiance of all of the science,
um,

3338
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:20,820
is,
uh,

3339
02:41:21,710 --> 02:41:22,410
and it's,
it's true,

3340
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:24,570
but it's on every other part of the 
problem.

3341
02:41:24,571 --> 02:41:29,571
He doesn't know anything about it.
I guarantee you he doesn't know the 

3342
02:41:29,571 --> 02:41:33,471
difference between Sunni and Shia Islam 
or which countries are Sunni 

3343
02:41:33,471 --> 02:41:34,980
predominantly in which are Shia 
predominantly.

3344
02:41:35,010 --> 02:41:37,200
And I mean,
I'm sure he's going to do,

3345
02:41:37,201 --> 02:41:39,090
I don't know when he's gonna Cram for 
this final exam,

3346
02:41:39,091 --> 02:41:41,160
I'm sure before one of those debates 
he's going to get,

3347
02:41:41,620 --> 02:41:46,620
you know,
someone's gonna sit down with him and 

3348
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:46,620
give him some bullet points.
He's got to have in his head,

3349
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:48,960
but his head is just not in this game.

3350
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:52,860
It's never been in this game.
It's obvious from everything he says and

3351
02:41:53,490 --> 02:41:55,740
that's what that is.
Something you can't say about Clinton.

3352
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:57,720
Right?
For all of her flaws as a person,

3353
02:41:57,721 --> 02:41:59,490
I don't care how much you hate her as a 
person.

3354
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:05,180
She understands what's going on in the 
world and that that difference is so 

3355
02:42:05,180 --> 02:42:09,531
enormous.
Forget about all the other character 

3356
02:42:09,531 --> 02:42:11,580
flaws of this guy who is just obviously 
going to.

3357
02:42:11,900 --> 02:42:15,690
I mean he's,
but are we attached to much to this idea

3358
02:42:15,691 --> 02:42:19,170
of one person being the figurehead,
figure it out.

3359
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:22,470
Someone has to be the decider.
If we all woke up today,

3360
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:25,410
if everybody woke up and there was just 
no government,

3361
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:27,720
there was nothing more.
All just what happened?

3362
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:32,750
I don't know,
but we've got to figure out how to run 

3363
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:32,750
this thing.
Well,

3364
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:32,750
we had no,
no previous understanding of government.

3365
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:37,521
Would you think anybody would say,
we need one dude to just run this whole 

3366
02:42:37,521 --> 02:42:40,500
giant continent filled with 300 million 
people who are most likely if we woke up

3367
02:42:40,501 --> 02:42:42,690
and we had technology like we have 
today,

3368
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:47,840
we have the ability to communicate like 
we have today with social media and 

3369
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:47,840
whatever.

3370
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:51,800
We would probably say we need to like 
figure this out amongst each other and 

3371
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:55,551
find the people that have the most 
qualified for each one of these 

3372
02:42:55,551 --> 02:42:56,580
positions and we'll start running our 
government that way.

3373
02:42:56,610 --> 02:42:58,740
Well that that's what we're attempting 
to do,

3374
02:42:58,770 --> 02:43:03,770
but it's just,
and I totally agree with you that it is 

3375
02:43:03,770 --> 02:43:05,250
astonishing that out of a nation of 300 
million people,

3376
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:10,340
these are the choices you would think 
you would think would be starting from 

3377
02:43:10,340 --> 02:43:10,340
your base.
That you know,

3378
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:12,070
your zero set point of just,
you know,

3379
02:43:12,071 --> 02:43:15,280
now we're going to reboot civilization.
Um,

3380
02:43:16,210 --> 02:43:20,020
you would think that if you had this 
kind of process,

3381
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:23,810
each candidate would be more impressive 
than the next man.

3382
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,050
You'd be like,
I can't believe each,

3383
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:29,850
each person who came to the podium like 
James,

3384
02:43:29,851 --> 02:43:30,760
oh yeah.
It'd be like,

3385
02:43:30,761 --> 02:43:32,320
it'd be like the dunk contest,
you know,

3386
02:43:32,321 --> 02:43:33,880
for the NBA and be like,
oh my God,

3387
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:39,120
I could just,
when you thought you saw the best dunk 

3388
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:39,120
in your life,
you know,

3389
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:41,140
the next guy comes along and it would be
that.

3390
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:43,540
It would be that on every topic,
right?

3391
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:47,110
It'd be like you'd be talking about the 
science of climate change.

3392
02:43:47,111 --> 02:43:51,260
You'd be talking about the actual 
dynamics of the war on terror,

3393
02:43:51,810 --> 02:43:56,410
so topics that seem to have no 
relationship where you would have to be.

3394
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:59,470
You'd be amazed at anyone could be an 
expert in all of them.

3395
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:03,280
You would find someone who is an expert,
a functional expert in all of them.

3396
02:44:03,470 --> 02:44:04,420
Agility,
winter dude.

3397
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:04,990
Yeah,
yeah.

3398
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:10,020
But,
but someone who also ethically wise who 

3399
02:44:10,020 --> 02:44:11,270
wasn't just wasn't obviously an asshole.
Um,

3400
02:44:11,950 --> 02:44:14,730
and who,
uh,

3401
02:44:15,320 --> 02:44:16,660
who,
who had a,

3402
02:44:17,210 --> 02:44:22,210
a mature relationship to change in his 
or her mind.

3403
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:23,470
Right?
So,

3404
02:44:23,471 --> 02:44:25,960
like the whole bit about flip flopping 
and,

3405
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:27,580
and not,
um,

3406
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:33,200
you know,
being like someone who could honestly 

3407
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:33,210
represent changes of mind in,
in,

3408
02:44:33,580 --> 02:44:35,680
across a political career.
Right.

3409
02:44:35,930 --> 02:44:37,660
You know,
it's nowhere written.

3410
02:44:37,661 --> 02:44:41,590
That is a good thing to believe today,
what you believe 20 years ago.

3411
02:44:41,590 --> 02:44:43,240
In fact,
if they do that on every topic,

3412
02:44:43,241 --> 02:44:45,790
it means basically you haven't been in 
dialogue with the world,

3413
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:51,840
but there's something,
it's so taboo to change your mind that 

3414
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:53,770
either you have to lie about it or you 
have to pretend it was a,

3415
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:56,590
it was always that way.
Or um,

3416
02:44:57,100 --> 02:44:58,300
it's just a,
uh,

3417
02:44:58,770 --> 02:45:01,360
the system,
the system is,

3418
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:05,290
is broken in that respect,
but given the choices,

3419
02:45:05,700 --> 02:45:10,700
you know,
and when you have a choice between 

3420
02:45:10,700 --> 02:45:12,391
someone who is for all her flaws,
been in the game for long enough to be 

3421
02:45:14,231 --> 02:45:18,580
really well informed and capable of 
compromise and capable of,

3422
02:45:19,110 --> 02:45:20,410
uh,
not just,

3423
02:45:20,590 --> 02:45:25,590
uh,
just breaking the entire machine and you

3424
02:45:28,991 --> 02:45:31,990
have someone who's just,
he could just got stepped off the set of

3425
02:45:31,991 --> 02:45:36,340
his reality TV show and then the lied 
about everything and,

3426
02:45:36,350 --> 02:45:39,790
uh,
and elbowed his way onto your television

3427
02:45:39,791 --> 02:45:42,200
set and never left because,
you know,

3428
02:45:42,450 --> 02:45:45,760
CNN couldn't figure out how to give the 
mic to someone else.

3429
02:45:46,200 --> 02:45:48,040
Um,
it's,

3430
02:45:48,041 --> 02:45:49,240
uh,
it's amazing.

3431
02:45:49,480 --> 02:45:51,790
Well,
he's a product of attention because they

3432
02:45:51,791 --> 02:45:54,490
realize that there's the heated race,
right?

3433
02:45:54,491 --> 02:45:59,491
The heated race,
this guy was really famous and in a 

3434
02:45:59,491 --> 02:46:01,920
heated race,
this guy would say some crazy stuff and 

3435
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:02,140
so they would tune into him so everybody
had to do an intro.

3436
02:46:02,141 --> 02:46:07,141
So because of him saying crazy stuff,
he accelerated the amount they were 

3437
02:46:07,141 --> 02:46:10,561
talking about them.
So they're constantly talking about him 

3438
02:46:10,561 --> 02:46:10,561
and barely talking other people and.

3439
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:11,510
But he's created

3440
02:46:11,710 --> 02:46:16,710
warm hole in our political process now 
where there's nothing so crazy that 

3441
02:46:16,710 --> 02:46:21,251
could disqualify him among the people 
who like him to so he can just keep it 

3442
02:46:21,251 --> 02:46:22,800
just like nuclear bombs of craziness 
that,

3443
02:46:22,801 --> 02:46:26,950
that,
that the press can't ignore that the,

3444
02:46:26,951 --> 02:46:28,350
every time they think,
okay,

3445
02:46:28,351 --> 02:46:31,350
this is the crazy thing he said that's 
going to harm his candidacy,

3446
02:46:31,351 --> 02:46:33,870
so let's shine a light on it.
It just helps him,

3447
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:35,220
you know,
he could,

3448
02:46:35,460 --> 02:46:36,510
he could,
he could,

3449
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:37,710
he could get on twitter right now and 
say,

3450
02:46:37,711 --> 02:46:38,690
you know who I'd like to fuck,

3451
02:46:38,710 --> 02:46:43,710
I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj and,
and it would work for him.

3452
02:46:45,850 --> 02:46:50,850
It was work for them.
You would see a use a tweet storm of a 

3453
02:46:50,850 --> 02:46:54,061
billion people who say,
I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj to go get 

3454
02:46:54,061 --> 02:46:55,300
her,
and it's insanity.

3455
02:46:55,330 --> 02:46:59,470
That's where we are.
But in a sense,

3456
02:46:59,500 --> 02:47:03,070
if w w we,
we do admit this is a fucked up system.

3457
02:47:03,071 --> 02:47:08,071
It's not ideal.
It should definitely be reworked and 

3458
02:47:08,071 --> 02:47:08,560
it's so hard to rework.
Wouldn't the best way to rework it?

3459
02:47:08,830 --> 02:47:12,010
A trump asteroid just slams right into 
the White House.

3460
02:47:12,310 --> 02:47:15,000
Boom,
blows the whole thing sky high.

3461
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:18,400
Who knows what terrible things have to 
happen,

3462
02:47:18,401 --> 02:47:21,990
but maybe that would be enough.
The thing is we have those,

3463
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:22,480
those assets,

3464
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:27,500
troy's are coming anyway.
So when you look at like nine slash 11 

3465
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:27,500
was an asteroid,
right?

3466
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:29,750
So it's like a or,
or a superbug that,

3467
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:34,920
that becomes a pandemic,
that these are things that are coming 

3468
02:47:35,190 --> 02:47:40,070
and we need people who are in touch 
with,

3469
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:42,720
with reality to deal with them.
Right?

3470
02:47:42,721 --> 02:47:46,260
So like the moment someone advertises 
their,

3471
02:47:46,290 --> 02:47:49,230
not only their ignorance,
but the fact that they don't care,

3472
02:47:49,470 --> 02:47:52,350
that they're ignorant and they do that 
this again and again,

3473
02:47:52,351 --> 02:47:57,351
they keep doubling down that person.
It's like if you put that person at the 

3474
02:47:57,351 --> 02:48:01,371
helm,
what you have done is basically put 

3475
02:48:01,371 --> 02:48:02,030
chaos at the hill,
right?

3476
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:02,400
It's like,
like,

3477
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:07,450
this is,
this person's going to believe whatever 

3478
02:48:07,450 --> 02:48:09,171
he believes,
regardless of the information coming in 

3479
02:48:09,171 --> 02:48:10,470
and regardless of the consequences,
that's just.

3480
02:48:10,471 --> 02:48:11,430
I mean,
it's,

3481
02:48:11,560 --> 02:48:14,070
it's,
it's worse than having no one in charge.

3482
02:48:14,071 --> 02:48:14,960
I mean,
because you've,

3483
02:48:15,020 --> 02:48:20,020
you've,
you've put the power in this person's 

3484
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:20,020
hands,
right?

3485
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:20,020
So this,
this person is,

3486
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:24,801
everything has to go through this node 
in the network that is just like an 

3487
02:48:24,931 --> 02:48:27,090
information scrambling device.
Right?

3488
02:48:27,091 --> 02:48:27,860
So like,
know how Matt,

3489
02:48:27,870 --> 02:48:29,760
no matter how good the information is 
coming in,

3490
02:48:29,970 --> 02:48:33,360
you have everything that you've got a 
bottleneck here which just screws up the

3491
02:48:33,361 --> 02:48:34,050
signal,
right?

3492
02:48:34,480 --> 02:48:36,900
Um,
that's what you're doing.

3493
02:48:36,901 --> 02:48:37,830
If you're,
if you're,

3494
02:48:37,860 --> 02:48:41,670
if you're hiring someone like this,
who I'm,

3495
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:42,510
I mean,
yeah,

3496
02:48:42,511 --> 02:48:43,880
in the best case,
you're,

3497
02:48:44,790 --> 02:48:47,670
what you stated earlier would in fact be
true,

3498
02:48:47,671 --> 02:48:47,880
which,
uh,

3499
02:48:47,881 --> 02:48:52,881
he'll,
he'll get into the oval office and even 

3500
02:48:52,881 --> 02:48:52,881
he will be scared about,
of the prospect that he is now

3501
02:48:52,881 --> 02:48:54,520
running the better part of human 
civilization.

3502
02:48:55,180 --> 02:48:57,520
And he will hire the best people,

3503
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:03,080
some semblance of the best people he can
get access to and say,

3504
02:49:03,100 --> 02:49:06,860
tell me how to not screw this up.
And that will be a.

3505
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:12,620
and then it'll.
Then it'll essentially be business as 

3506
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:12,620
usual.
Right?

3507
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:13,710
Insofar as you've hired,
the best people will be people.

3508
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:16,620
People who are deeply in this game 
already,

3509
02:49:16,621 --> 02:49:17,420
right?
You know,

3510
02:49:17,430 --> 02:49:19,970
he'll defer to the generals when it 
comes time to make

3511
02:49:20,050 --> 02:49:25,050
wore the being real.
Really pragmatic about how they pick 

3512
02:49:25,050 --> 02:49:27,250
politicians and how they push certain 
people and decided I had to push others.

3513
02:49:27,670 --> 02:49:32,020
Do you think that something like trump 
completely changes how they move forward

3514
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:36,220
now they realized that this can happen.
Like now that you see that people are so

3515
02:49:36,221 --> 02:49:40,030
goofy were so wwe eat out that you can 
get this guy,

3516
02:49:40,330 --> 02:49:41,500
you know,
I mean this is,

3517
02:49:41,530 --> 02:49:42,700
this is where we're at.
We're,

3518
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:45,910
we've got a guy.
I told them the wall just got 10 foot.

3519
02:49:45,960 --> 02:49:48,440
Hi.
Everybody gets crazy.

3520
02:49:48,441 --> 02:49:49,910
Like how could you say that?

3521
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:52,530
Yeah.
Once they realize that that's possible.

3522
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:55,710
How long before you get like some 
motivational speaker type dudes?

3523
02:49:56,570 --> 02:49:57,960
Long before they started jumping in 
there,

3524
02:49:58,230 --> 02:50:00,490
Tony Robbins had presence.
That's what we have.

3525
02:50:00,491 --> 02:50:01,240
I mean,
that's.

3526
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:06,820
Oh,
this is way worse than Tony Robbins for 

3527
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:06,820
president.
Yeah.

3528
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:06,820
Way.
Way more positive dude.

3529
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:06,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

3530
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:08,390
But I'd vote for him.
You know,

3531
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:09,540
Tony Robbins,
positive guy.

3532
02:50:09,541 --> 02:50:10,340
No,
that's not what I mean.

3533
02:50:10,341 --> 02:50:15,341
I mean,
but that sort of ability to excite 

3534
02:50:15,341 --> 02:50:18,000
people get like one of those 
motivational speaker dudes,

3535
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:23,420
those guys.
Whereas a lot of yoga pants and he's 

3536
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:25,250
gonna.
He's gonna be the next president is 

3537
02:50:25,250 --> 02:50:25,740
going to get us in shape.
Getting be a reality show.

3538
02:50:25,910 --> 02:50:29,160
America is a reality show where there 
were awesome.

3539
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:30,210
We're the best.

3540
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:34,290
Did you see this press conference he 
held?

3541
02:50:34,620 --> 02:50:36,790
I think it was yesterday.
I did not know.

3542
02:50:36,850 --> 02:50:40,590
There was a very funny moment where 
there was one journalist.

3543
02:50:40,770 --> 02:50:43,840
I didn't recognize who it was,
who gets hooked.

3544
02:50:44,010 --> 02:50:49,010
So trump was being very combative with 
the press pool and he was,

3545
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:50,280
he was basically,
you know,

3546
02:50:50,281 --> 02:50:52,110
shouting them down,
not answering any of the questions.

3547
02:50:52,380 --> 02:50:54,450
And one journalist,
just a gas said,

3548
02:50:54,900 --> 02:50:57,960
is this what is going to be like when 
your president and is this,

3549
02:50:57,961 --> 02:51:02,961
how is this what is going to be like to 
be in the White House press corps and 

3550
02:51:02,961 --> 02:51:03,440
deal with you?
And uh,

3551
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:04,230
and he said,
yes,

3552
02:51:04,340 --> 02:51:08,060
this is exactly what's gonna be like.
And,

3553
02:51:08,061 --> 02:51:13,061
but you,
you could just see that like the 

3554
02:51:13,061 --> 02:51:13,061
journalists,
like they,

3555
02:51:13,061 --> 02:51:13,061
they,
they turn the camera on the room,

3556
02:51:13,061 --> 02:51:17,151
a journalists and they,
they are astonished by what is happening

3557
02:51:19,021 --> 02:51:24,021
here.
Like they don't know they're 

3558
02:51:24,021 --> 02:51:24,021
participating in this process and in,
in,

3559
02:51:24,021 --> 02:51:24,021
in some sense they've created this 
process.

3560
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:25,540
Um,
but,

3561
02:51:25,541 --> 02:51:25,900
uh,

3562
02:51:27,610 --> 02:51:28,390
no,
not all of you.

3563
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:32,350
Many of you are enough of us.
Is this what you do?

3564
02:51:32,440 --> 02:51:37,440
Is it,
is this what it's going to be like 

3565
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:37,440
covering you if your president?
Yeah,

3566
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:41,330
let,
let me just have this kind of take 

3567
02:51:41,330 --> 02:51:41,330
charge in the restroom.
Okay.

3568
02:51:41,330 --> 02:51:41,330
Yeah,
it is going to be like this David.

3569
02:51:41,330 --> 02:51:45,510
If the press writes false stores like 
they did with this because you know,

3570
02:51:45,760 --> 02:51:48,070
half of you are amazed that I raised all
this money.

3571
02:51:48,550 --> 02:51:53,550
If the press writes false start as like 
they did where I want it to keep a low 

3572
02:51:53,550 --> 02:51:54,910
profile,
I didn't want the credit for raising all

3573
02:51:54,911 --> 02:51:59,911
this money for the vets.
I wasn't looking for the credit and by 

3574
02:51:59,911 --> 02:52:02,581
the way more money is coming in.
I wasn't looking for the credit but I 

3575
02:52:02,581 --> 02:52:06,511
had no choice but to do this because the
press was saying I didn't raise any 

3576
02:52:06,511 --> 02:52:06,511
money.
Them not only that,

3577
02:52:06,511 --> 02:52:09,010
I raise it,
much of it was given a long time ago and

3578
02:52:09,011 --> 02:52:11,380
there is a vetting process and I think 
you understand that,

3579
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:16,680
but when I raised almost $6,000,000
in probably in the end were raised more 

3580
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:18,280
than six because more is going to come 
in and is coming in.

3581
02:52:18,670 --> 02:52:21,400
But when I raised five point 6 million,
as of today,

3582
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:23,530
Maura's coming in and I.
and,

3583
02:52:23,531 --> 02:52:28,531
and this is going to phenomenal groups 
and have many of these people vetting 

3584
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:29,980
the people that are getting the money.
And

3585
02:52:30,270 --> 02:52:35,270
you played the moment I was referring to
probably live here.

3586
02:52:36,031 --> 02:52:41,031
Is it a case where he's probably almost 
certainly line about his history of 

3587
02:52:41,031 --> 02:52:44,490
giving to veterans affairs and says he,
he gave money very recently after people

3588
02:52:44,491 --> 02:52:49,491
started fishing around to see if he 
actually had given the money that he 

3589
02:52:49,491 --> 02:52:49,770
claimed to have given to,
to veterans.

3590
02:52:50,490 --> 02:52:52,530
Um,
but,

3591
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:54,480
uh,
I mean this is,

3592
02:52:55,770 --> 02:52:58,910
what's difficult about this is that,
I mean the pr,

3593
02:52:58,980 --> 02:53:03,980
yes,
there are the presses highly imperfect 

3594
02:53:03,980 --> 02:53:07,281
and there and also partisan and there 
are false stories and there are 

3595
02:53:07,281 --> 02:53:09,840
exaggerations and they screw people 
over.

3596
02:53:09,841 --> 02:53:14,841
Yes.
And there are reasons to not trust the 

3597
02:53:17,761 --> 02:53:22,761
press from time to time,
but in this case you have a,

3598
02:53:25,770 --> 02:53:30,770
someone who there is no amount of fact 
checking and discuss information of his 

3599
02:53:31,161 --> 02:53:36,161
statements that,
that forces him to ever acknowledge 

3600
02:53:36,161 --> 02:53:40,580
anything that he's done wrong and the 
and the lack of acknowledgement that he 

3601
02:53:40,580 --> 02:53:42,630
pays no price for it among,
among the people who like him.

3602
02:53:43,080 --> 02:53:46,770
And so the press is powerless and then,
and then.

3603
02:53:46,800 --> 02:53:49,200
But the net result of like a,
of a press conference like this,

3604
02:53:49,201 --> 02:53:54,201
if you were a trump's follower is he 
just showed how biased and and petty the

3605
02:53:58,141 --> 02:54:03,141
press pool is.
And the press do need to just be beaten 

3606
02:54:03,141 --> 02:54:06,321
up by a strong man who,
who's not going to stand for their 

3607
02:54:06,321 --> 02:54:06,321
bullshit,
but it's a,

3608
02:54:06,360 --> 02:54:07,260
it's a,
um,

3609
02:54:07,660 --> 02:54:11,250
I mean it's unbecoming at the very 
least,

3610
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:14,970
that kind of communication.
It's kind of unbecoming that person that

3611
02:54:14,971 --> 02:54:16,350
we expect.
And that's pretty mild.

3612
02:54:16,380 --> 02:54:16,920
No,
that's my.

3613
02:54:17,050 --> 02:54:19,110
Compared to his leg,
his parody of the,

3614
02:54:19,140 --> 02:54:20,040
of the,
um,

3615
02:54:20,730 --> 02:54:23,010
the disabled reporter.
Who He.

3616
02:54:23,011 --> 02:54:26,050
I mean,
you saw that bit where he did like a,

3617
02:54:26,370 --> 02:54:27,060
a,
um,

3618
02:54:27,460 --> 02:54:30,840
a cerebral palsy invitation at,
at one of his speeches.

3619
02:54:31,290 --> 02:54:31,800
He was the.
Yeah.

3620
02:54:31,801 --> 02:54:32,220
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3621
02:54:32,380 --> 02:54:37,380
He was interviewed by.
I don't happen to know who the reporter 

3622
02:54:37,380 --> 02:54:37,380
was.
Oh,

3623
02:54:37,380 --> 02:54:40,960
he was making.
He was making fun of somebody with 

3624
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:42,480
cerebral palsy.
He's done so many things that you could,

3625
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:47,510
that you would think would be 
fundamentally canceling of a person's 

3626
02:54:47,701 --> 02:54:49,140
political aspirations.
Like,

3627
02:54:49,141 --> 02:54:54,141
like you,
you can't even cut marco rubio 

3628
02:54:54,141 --> 02:54:54,900
pretending to be like a.
just goofy on someone's cerebral palsy,

3629
02:54:56,500 --> 02:54:59,200
added at one of his campaign events.
Oh,

3630
02:54:59,490 --> 02:55:00,420
trend,
right.

3631
02:55:01,140 --> 02:55:04,130
One of the things that some Ted Cruz was
that video of him

3632
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:07,110
with his family,
the outtakes where they like,

3633
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:08,310
oh,
you didn't see it.

3634
02:55:08,540 --> 02:55:10,820
It's a gem.
It's spectacular.

3635
02:55:10,821 --> 02:55:15,821
It's him with his mom and he's like,
my mom prays for me often for hours 

3636
02:55:15,821 --> 02:55:17,410
everyday,
and she like her.

3637
02:55:17,630 --> 02:55:18,200
She looks.
I'm like,

3638
02:55:18,201 --> 02:55:23,201
what the fuck?
You're talking about four hours every 

3639
02:55:23,201 --> 02:55:23,201
day?
No,

3640
02:55:23,201 --> 02:55:23,201
I don't.
He can't even say that.

3641
02:55:23,201 --> 02:55:25,380
And so they have all these really 
awkward moments like,

3642
02:55:25,690 --> 02:55:26,930
okay,
I'm going to go in for a hug.

3643
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:29,180
I'm going to say I love you.
It's all.

3644
02:55:29,930 --> 02:55:33,950
It's all like weirdly mapped out and 
that got online and people were like,

3645
02:55:33,951 --> 02:55:34,940
Oh,
Christ,

3646
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,790
okay.
See this is.

3647
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:40,340
This is a bad game.
Like you're not even good at this game.

3648
02:55:40,490 --> 02:55:42,200
This is you.
You're terrible at this game.

3649
02:55:42,540 --> 02:55:44,390
Yeah.
He was objectively terrible.

3650
02:55:45,620 --> 02:55:46,400
Well,
that's his.

3651
02:55:46,450 --> 02:55:48,140
That's trumped competition.
Well,

3652
02:55:48,141 --> 02:55:48,940
the thing that would think about

3653
02:55:48,980 --> 02:55:53,980
crews that never even got out,
which was the reason to be scared about 

3654
02:55:53,980 --> 02:55:56,180
a Cruz presidency,
was his level of religious craziness.

3655
02:55:56,181 --> 02:56:01,181
I mean,
no one was even pushing on that because 

3656
02:56:01,181 --> 02:56:01,181
there was just enough to push on before

3657
02:56:01,181 --> 02:56:02,650
and got to that door and then you have 
to hold onto those weapons.

3658
02:56:03,130 --> 02:56:08,130
But I mean,
it hadn't been for had crews been the 

3659
02:56:08,130 --> 02:56:08,770
nominee,
it would have been all about religion.

3660
02:56:09,370 --> 02:56:11,860
What's,
what's odd is that that's not a handicap

3661
02:56:11,890 --> 02:56:16,630
in 2016 that you can have that and 
people consider it an asset.

3662
02:56:17,110 --> 02:56:22,110
Well,
the one thing that's surprising and 

3663
02:56:22,110 --> 02:56:23,681
actually hopeful in trump's candidacy is
the fact that he has,

3664
02:56:25,010 --> 02:56:29,650
he has dissected out the religious,
social conservative component of,

3665
02:56:29,690 --> 02:56:33,800
of the Republican Party.
So like the evangelicals,

3666
02:56:33,801 --> 02:56:37,370
for the most part,
we're going for trump over crews when it

3667
02:56:37,371 --> 02:56:42,140
was pretty clear to them that trump was 
just pretending to be religious.

3668
02:56:42,340 --> 02:56:42,950
And I mean,
so it's a.

3669
02:56:43,130 --> 02:56:47,690
trump gave one speech at know I think 
Liberty University where he spoke.

3670
02:56:47,691 --> 02:56:49,780
He said Corinthians two,
um,

3671
02:56:50,210 --> 02:56:55,210
and you know,
that's not the way any bible reader 

3672
02:56:55,210 --> 02:56:57,950
would,
would speak about the second 

3673
02:56:57,950 --> 02:56:57,950
Corinthians.
How would you say it?

3674
02:56:57,950 --> 02:56:59,000
Second Corinthians,
that's how you would say,

3675
02:56:59,010 --> 02:56:59,860
yeah.
Yeah.

3676
02:56:59,870 --> 02:57:00,450
And so,
so he,

3677
02:57:00,460 --> 02:57:04,690
so he said Corinthians two as like,
as though this is something that he just

3678
02:57:04,790 --> 02:57:06,890
opened every,
every night before he went to sleep.

3679
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:12,650
And so it's clear that it was clear to 
them that he's,

3680
02:57:12,860 --> 02:57:17,240
that he is just,
just mining the language,

3681
02:57:17,241 --> 02:57:17,870
you know,
or,

3682
02:57:17,930 --> 02:57:22,930
or I'm impersonating a person to faith 
and um,

3683
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:27,320
but they don't care really as long as he
does it.

3684
02:57:27,590 --> 02:57:28,790
And that's,
that is,

3685
02:57:28,850 --> 02:57:30,380
you know,
if you're gonna look for a silver lining

3686
02:57:30,381 --> 02:57:31,550
to this,
it,

3687
02:57:32,030 --> 02:57:37,030
it shows that it's not,
it's they just want a space where their 

3688
02:57:37,821 --> 02:57:42,821
religious convictions are not under 
attack and they don't really care that 

3689
02:57:43,161 --> 02:57:45,900
the person in charge share them.
Just usually,

3690
02:57:46,070 --> 02:57:48,170
if you pretend to share them,
that's good enough.

3691
02:57:48,830 --> 02:57:49,780
And that's,
um,

3692
02:57:50,510 --> 02:57:52,640
that's better than actually carrying 
that.

3693
02:57:52,970 --> 02:57:57,970
This person really believe in the 
rapture or anything else that is quite 

3694
02:57:57,970 --> 02:57:58,970
obviously crazy.
Um,

3695
02:57:59,900 --> 02:58:00,470
but,
uh,

3696
02:58:00,530 --> 02:58:05,530
yeah,
so I don't think any Christian who was 

3697
02:58:05,530 --> 02:58:07,041
voting for trump thinks they'll say,
I'm not going to judge another man's 

3698
02:58:07,081 --> 02:58:07,920
faith,
right?

3699
02:58:07,921 --> 02:58:12,921
Or I'm not.
Who am I to say what's really in his 

3700
02:58:12,921 --> 02:58:12,921
heart?
Right?

3701
02:58:12,921 --> 02:58:13,780
They'll say that,
but he's just given you,

3702
02:58:13,950 --> 02:58:16,170
if you've been paying attention to who 
he's been and,

3703
02:58:16,280 --> 02:58:19,140
and if you just look at how he talks 
about these things,

3704
02:58:19,810 --> 02:58:21,810
um,
I don't think he's falling any,

3705
02:58:22,170 --> 02:58:27,170
any Christian that.
So I think they're willing to vote for 

3706
02:58:27,170 --> 02:58:30,801
someone for it now,
for other reasons that are fairly 

3707
02:58:30,801 --> 02:58:34,670
depressing in their own right.
They're willing to vote for someone 

3708
02:58:34,670 --> 02:58:36,330
who's,
who doesn't really play the game the way

3709
02:58:36,331 --> 02:58:36,630
they do.

3710
02:58:40,470 --> 02:58:44,220
You have to believe in God to be 
President Two thousand 16.

3711
02:58:44,221 --> 02:58:44,760
Right?
Wouldn't you?

3712
02:58:44,761 --> 02:58:46,830
Wouldn't you say that?
That has to pretend to believe in God.

3713
02:58:47,450 --> 02:58:50,170
But I think with trump,
I think,

3714
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:55,250
I think the pretense is,
is obvious enough that I don't think 

3715
02:58:55,381 --> 02:58:59,700
he's fooling the better part of the 
people who were voting for him who,

3716
02:58:59,710 --> 02:59:04,710
who would,
who would say they care about a person 

3717
02:59:04,710 --> 02:59:04,710
of faith being in the White House.
So I,

3718
02:59:04,710 --> 02:59:09,440
if anything,
he might be in one thing he might be 

3719
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:12,201
breaking is the barrier on having an 
atheist president because I think he,

3720
02:59:13,730 --> 02:59:16,370
you know,
it's just nobody,

3721
02:59:16,440 --> 02:59:19,830
nobody thinks he is a person to faith.
I don't think anyone really thinks that.

3722
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:22,430
So he's perfect.
He's made,

3723
02:59:22,431 --> 02:59:24,750
it might be our first atheist president 
who would help us in that,

3724
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:28,020
in that regard as well.
Another trump media right into the White

3725
02:59:28,020 --> 02:59:33,020
House.
I'm starting to sound like a trump 

3726
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:33,020
supporter.

3727
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:33,020
Occasionally an asteroid does something 
good.

3728
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:34,490
Who would be the ideal president?
I mean like what,

3729
02:59:34,520 --> 02:59:37,020
what kind of a person?
I mean it would probably be a person who

3730
02:59:37,021 --> 02:59:40,560
doesn't seek attention.
Probably be a person that.

3731
02:59:40,620 --> 02:59:41,820
Well,
I don't think it could be that.

3732
02:59:41,860 --> 02:59:44,110
I mean the,
the,

3733
02:59:44,170 --> 02:59:48,720
the process is even,
even an optimized process will be,

3734
02:59:49,980 --> 02:59:51,680
um,
will,

3735
02:59:52,820 --> 02:59:57,820
will require enough sacrifice of what 
ordinary people want.

3736
02:59:58,770 --> 03:00:03,770
Most of the time that it will be an 
unusual personality who has to get 

3737
03:00:03,770 --> 03:00:05,450
promoted and you will,
you will be on some metric be.

3738
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:11,940
I mean,
it's almost by definition narcissistic 

3739
03:00:11,940 --> 03:00:11,940
to think that you should be in this role
right?

3740
03:00:11,940 --> 03:00:16,140
Who are you to think that you should be 
running a civilization at this moment in

3741
03:00:16,141 --> 03:00:17,730
human history?
Um,

3742
03:00:18,180 --> 03:00:19,410
and to,
for you to be on it,

3743
03:00:19,411 --> 03:00:22,080
for you to honestly stand at the podium 
and say,

3744
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:27,030
I'm the guy or the woman like,
I am the most qualified,

3745
03:00:27,031 --> 03:00:28,200
I should be doing this.

3746
03:00:28,260 --> 03:00:29,280
Right.
I can help.

3747
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:31,460
Um,
you know,

3748
03:00:31,461 --> 03:00:36,461
if you,
if you're going to scrutinize the kind 

3749
03:00:36,461 --> 03:00:36,461
of personality that could give rise to 
those opinions,

3750
03:00:37,080 --> 03:00:38,340
it's not you.
Yeah.

3751
03:00:38,341 --> 03:00:42,380
There's some dials you would probably 
want to chain tweak if you,

3752
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:46,590
if you had to be married to this person 
or if it's not an optimal personality.

3753
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:49,470
So there's going to be kind of pathology
of,

3754
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,190
of power seeking that might be just 
intrinsic to it.

3755
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:54,900
But,
um,

3756
03:00:56,010 --> 03:00:59,100
you want someone who is actually wise 
ethically.

3757
03:00:59,210 --> 03:01:00,200
I mean,
just,

3758
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:05,280
just,
you're just trying to map that onto 

3759
03:01:05,280 --> 03:01:05,280
trump,
right?

3760
03:01:05,280 --> 03:01:05,280
Just,
he's.

3761
03:01:05,280 --> 03:01:08,850
Imagine someone saying thing I like 
about trump is that he is so deeply 

3762
03:01:08,850 --> 03:01:11,320
ethical and wise,
right?

3763
03:01:11,740 --> 03:01:14,680
It's just,
it does not.

3764
03:01:14,770 --> 03:01:19,770
I mean,
it's like saying it's because of his 

3765
03:01:19,770 --> 03:01:19,770
hair looks so natural.
Yeah.

3766
03:01:19,770 --> 03:01:19,840
I mean,
there's,

3767
03:01:19,841 --> 03:01:21,320
there's no,
um,

3768
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:24,250
it,
it is the antithesis of what he is,

3769
03:01:24,550 --> 03:01:24,850
right?

3770
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:26,280
Um,
the,

3771
03:01:26,430 --> 03:01:31,430
the thing I like about trump is that he 
is so well informed about the way the 

3772
03:01:31,430 --> 03:01:36,211
world works and where he's not informed,
he recognizes his ignorance so quickly 

3773
03:01:37,961 --> 03:01:42,961
and he remedies it as fast as possible.
He do know he seeks out the best 

3774
03:01:42,961 --> 03:01:44,620
experts,
defers to them.

3775
03:01:45,240 --> 03:01:47,710
Um,
and uh,

3776
03:01:48,170 --> 03:01:48,880
you know,
he's just,

3777
03:01:48,910 --> 03:01:51,970
he's mindful of the limits of his 
knowledge.

3778
03:01:52,310 --> 03:01:57,310
Seo As,
as he is about his expertise and his 

3779
03:01:57,310 --> 03:01:57,310
expertise is vast.
Right.

3780
03:01:57,610 --> 03:01:59,710
You'd want to be able to say that about 
a president.

3781
03:01:59,740 --> 03:02:02,020
You could not begin to say that about 
trump,

3782
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:05,200
right?
You could probably say that.

3783
03:02:05,290 --> 03:02:10,290
Honestly.
You could probably say that about 

3784
03:02:10,290 --> 03:02:10,290
Clinton,
right?

3785
03:02:10,290 --> 03:02:10,290
Like,
for,

3786
03:02:10,290 --> 03:02:13,800
for all her defects,
she's very knowledgeable and I'm sure 

3787
03:02:14,470 --> 03:02:16,690
she will just try it.
Where she,

3788
03:02:16,900 --> 03:02:21,900
where she doesn't feel like she's got 
the knowledge he's going to try to go 

3789
03:02:21,900 --> 03:02:21,900
to,
go to the source of the knowledge.

3790
03:02:21,900 --> 03:02:24,430
Right.
Just grab the best experts you can find.

3791
03:02:25,180 --> 03:02:27,010
Um,
I think she,

3792
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:32,100
I think she will be as aware as you are.
I would be of the consequences of not 

3793
03:02:33,071 --> 03:02:34,210
knowing what's going on,
right?

3794
03:02:34,290 --> 03:02:36,340
She's just going to want to find out 
what's going on.

3795
03:02:36,730 --> 03:02:41,730
Whereas this,
I mean all trump has advertised about 

3796
03:02:41,730 --> 03:02:45,151
himself is that he thinks that bluster 
and banality and bullying will win in 

3797
03:02:49,421 --> 03:02:51,850
every situation.
It's just like it's just attitude.

3798
03:02:51,880 --> 03:02:56,880
He's the guy is the guy is winging it 
and it could not be more obvious that 

3799
03:02:58,780 --> 03:03:01,480
this guy is winging it on every level.
I mean like it's just,

3800
03:03:01,570 --> 03:03:03,160
it is.
It is,

3801
03:03:04,470 --> 03:03:09,470
isn't it?
There there'd be no way for him to 

3802
03:03:09,470 --> 03:03:11,821
signal the fact that he's winging it 
more clearly than he is with everything 

3803
03:03:11,821 --> 03:03:13,990
he's doing and and yet there's no 
penalty.

3804
03:03:14,470 --> 03:03:17,650
Do you think it's possible that in this 
age of information,

3805
03:03:17,680 --> 03:03:22,680
the way we can communicate with each 
other that we're going to experience 

3806
03:03:22,680 --> 03:03:22,680
these cycles,
these waves,

3807
03:03:22,690 --> 03:03:27,690
these in and outs,
these high and low tides of really smart

3808
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:33,511
presidents and really stupid president 
and we just people revolt and there's 

3809
03:03:33,511 --> 03:03:35,200
just.
It's so easy to stay alive.

3810
03:03:35,201 --> 03:03:40,201
It's plenty of students who fill out 
there and so they're only willing to 

3811
03:03:40,201 --> 03:03:43,141
vote for other dme folks,
so the other dme folks get into 

3812
03:03:43,141 --> 03:03:46,350
position.
They send out the frequency that only 

3813
03:03:46,350 --> 03:03:46,350
the dummies here and everybody else is 
going,

3814
03:03:46,350 --> 03:03:49,750
what the fuck is everybody voting for 
this guy for what is happening,

3815
03:03:50,080 --> 03:03:55,080
and then it makes the smart people 
rebound and for years and challenge 

3816
03:03:55,080 --> 03:03:59,221
themselves a new because they they need 
some of an enemy to rally against to 

3817
03:03:59,221 --> 03:04:02,660
reach their full potential and that 
without the low tide,

3818
03:04:02,661 --> 03:04:04,830
you cannot have the high tide Sam 
Harris.

3819
03:04:06,410 --> 03:04:11,410
Hopefully that's not an analogy that 
applies for the maintenance of 

3820
03:04:11,410 --> 03:04:14,100
civilization.
This smell the time man.

3821
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:19,120
Maybe at the very least,
it's a wakeup call for the political 

3822
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:19,890
establishment.
This silly game that you've been running

3823
03:04:19,891 --> 03:04:24,320
have two candidates just doesn't work.
Someone can cooperate your candidacy.

3824
03:04:24,350 --> 03:04:27,200
Get in there,
throw the fucking monkey wrench into the

3825
03:04:27,201 --> 03:04:29,660
gear system and guess what?
Trump's running for president now.

3826
03:04:29,661 --> 03:04:30,770
He's the.
He's the head,

3827
03:04:31,430 --> 03:04:34,280
he's the head guy for the Republicans.
How is that even possible?

3828
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:35,630
They don't know.

3829
03:04:35,970 --> 03:04:37,430
Amazing.
It is a way,

3830
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:42,460
if nothing else,
it has a total wakeup call for the 

3831
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:42,460
Republicans.
I mean,

3832
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:42,460
they are just,

3833
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:42,480
it's June aghast.
Yeah,

3834
03:04:42,560 --> 03:04:45,740
it's June.
Everything's decided locked down.

3835
03:04:45,830 --> 03:04:48,200
So we have July,
August,

3836
03:04:48,201 --> 03:04:49,700
September,
October,

3837
03:04:49,701 --> 03:04:51,710
November.
We're that close.

3838
03:04:53,820 --> 03:04:58,820
But he's not someone who has been,
who is aligned with the Republican 

3839
03:04:58,921 --> 03:05:03,330
platform in most ways.
Right.

3840
03:05:03,331 --> 03:05:08,331
So it's like he's been,
truth is virtually no one knows what his

3841
03:05:09,091 --> 03:05:12,660
policies are because he,
he keeps changing his position on things

3842
03:05:12,661 --> 03:05:14,640
like taxation and it's like,
if there actually is no keys,

3843
03:05:14,641 --> 03:05:17,520
he said he's talked to on both sides of,
of,

3844
03:05:17,670 --> 03:05:20,190
of core issue,
core Republican issues.

3845
03:05:20,191 --> 03:05:24,960
But I mean,
in many ways he's left of Hillary,

3846
03:05:25,440 --> 03:05:26,310
right?
He's,

3847
03:05:26,400 --> 03:05:31,400
you know,
he's left of Hillary in terms of being 

3848
03:05:31,400 --> 03:05:31,400
an isolationist.
Like he's,

3849
03:05:31,400 --> 03:05:31,400
you know,
he,

3850
03:05:32,070 --> 03:05:35,700
his,
his relationship to war is,

3851
03:05:36,420 --> 03:05:37,650
but both extremes.
Like,

3852
03:05:37,651 --> 03:05:39,210
he's like,
no,

3853
03:05:39,211 --> 03:05:44,211
we're just gonna.
We're gonna get out of the world's 

3854
03:05:44,211 --> 03:05:44,211
business.
Right?

3855
03:05:44,211 --> 03:05:45,940
We're going to be isolationists,
which is deeply anti Republican.

3856
03:05:46,370 --> 03:05:51,370
Um,
but I'm going to be the maniac who 

3857
03:05:51,370 --> 03:05:51,530
you're never going to know who I'm going
to bomb next.

3858
03:05:51,640 --> 03:05:53,220
We're going to,
we're going to wipe out isis.

3859
03:05:53,221 --> 03:05:54,600
We're just straight away,
right.

3860
03:05:54,601 --> 03:05:56,640
Did Not,
not a man left standing.

3861
03:05:57,150 --> 03:06:02,150
Um,
and I'm not gonna take any shit from 

3862
03:06:02,150 --> 03:06:03,660
anyone including China and North Korea.
And so he's that.

3863
03:06:03,661 --> 03:06:07,770
But we're going to pull back in a huge 
way and not be in anyone's business,

3864
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:09,480
right?
He said both of those things.

3865
03:06:09,980 --> 03:06:12,250
Um,
uh,

3866
03:06:13,790 --> 03:06:15,750
it's,
it's,

3867
03:06:16,320 --> 03:06:21,320
it's way too interesting way it may.
We don't want politics to be this 

3868
03:06:21,511 --> 03:06:26,280
interesting and it's going to be 
November is going to be if the polls are

3869
03:06:26,281 --> 03:06:28,620
closed and watching those debates and,
and,

3870
03:06:28,750 --> 03:06:29,700
and,
and,

3871
03:06:30,450 --> 03:06:35,450
uh,
waiting for swinging the polls as a 

3872
03:06:35,450 --> 03:06:35,450
result,
it's just going to be,

3873
03:06:35,450 --> 03:06:38,630
it's to be way too interesting.
That's gonna be like watching the 

3874
03:06:38,630 --> 03:06:38,630
superbowl,
those first debates,

3875
03:06:38,630 --> 03:06:43,090
you know,
it's going to be 100 million people 

3876
03:06:43,090 --> 03:06:44,010
watching those debates.
I have a prediction.

3877
03:06:45,210 --> 03:06:46,290
I think,
uh,

3878
03:06:48,660 --> 03:06:53,660
I think it's entirely possible.
This whole thing was a plot that didn't 

3879
03:06:53,660 --> 03:06:56,190
work out.
I think he probably came out of the gate

3880
03:06:56,190 --> 03:07:01,190
saying crazy shit,
thinking he would tank the Republican 

3881
03:07:01,190 --> 03:07:05,210
Party and get his friend Hillary Clinton
into the White House that she didn't 

3882
03:07:05,210 --> 03:07:07,590
attend to work out.
He kept trying to insult her,

3883
03:07:07,890 --> 03:07:12,890
kept trying to make stuff up about 
Mexicans and it just kept making them 

3884
03:07:12,890 --> 03:07:13,020
get better and better and now he's 
stuck.

3885
03:07:13,470 --> 03:07:17,120
He can't pull out that.
That would be.

3886
03:07:17,121 --> 03:07:19,260
That would be a great moment.
That would change the system.

3887
03:07:19,710 --> 03:07:24,710
Well,
we're going to have to go through 

3888
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:24,710
something like this in order for us to 
realize that this is crazy,

3889
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:26,910
that a guy can just do this,
can just not really have any interest in

3890
03:07:26,911 --> 03:07:31,911
politics until that.
And then he should get the Nobel prize 

3891
03:07:31,911 --> 03:07:32,550
for everything.
If he pulls out at this point and says,

3892
03:07:32,551 --> 03:07:33,450
listen,
I'm just,

3893
03:07:33,550 --> 03:07:38,550
I took you to the precipice here just 
because I wanted you to recognize how 

3894
03:07:38,610 --> 03:07:40,980
unstable this situation is.
I mean,

3895
03:07:40,981 --> 03:07:45,981
you,
you guys could elect a demagogue who is 

3896
03:07:47,551 --> 03:07:49,200
actually an incoherent demagogue.

3897
03:07:49,230 --> 03:07:54,230
I'm not,
I haven't even been playing an 

3898
03:07:54,230 --> 03:07:54,230
incoherent authoritarian.
Right?

3899
03:07:54,230 --> 03:07:54,230
I'm,
I'm,

3900
03:07:54,230 --> 03:07:54,740
I'm,
uh,

3901
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:59,900
on one hand,
a very liberal right and tolerant and on

3902
03:08:00,571 --> 03:08:05,571
the other hand I'm like getting ready to
be Hitler and you guys can't figure out 

3903
03:08:05,571 --> 03:08:07,080
who I am and yet you're still prepared 
to vote for me.

3904
03:08:07,650 --> 03:08:08,700
Um,
I mean,

3905
03:08:08,820 --> 03:08:11,040
yeah,
for him to do a postmortem on,

3906
03:08:11,070 --> 03:08:13,710
on his Punkin of,
of the culture,

3907
03:08:14,250 --> 03:08:16,710
that would be the best thing to ever 
happen.

3908
03:08:17,280 --> 03:08:17,790
But,
uh,

3909
03:08:17,910 --> 03:08:22,910
I don't think that's what's happening.
We need someone like this so that we 

3910
03:08:22,910 --> 03:08:25,300
realize how silly this whole thing is.
Do we need some,

3911
03:08:25,700 --> 03:08:30,700
we need a qualified person to deal with 
all of the other hassles and dangers 

3912
03:08:30,700 --> 03:08:32,010
that are coming our way,
that have nothing to do with,

3913
03:08:32,330 --> 03:08:35,490
with what we do.
But that person's not there.

3914
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:38,220
Even even if we were doing everything 
perfectly,

3915
03:08:39,450 --> 03:08:44,450
they would still be this tsunami of risk
and hassle and waste and all the rest of

3916
03:08:52,621 --> 03:08:55,260
the world's chaos that is coming our 
way.

3917
03:08:55,340 --> 03:08:58,260
And it just forget,
even if we had our,

3918
03:08:58,261 --> 03:09:00,630
our house in order,
in every respect,

3919
03:09:01,260 --> 03:09:05,480
we still have terrorism and the global 
climate change will,

3920
03:09:05,490 --> 03:09:06,050
you know,
you've got,

3921
03:09:06,070 --> 03:09:10,410
you've got China and India and what are 
they doing in terms of a compliant with,

3922
03:09:11,010 --> 03:09:11,760
with,
um,

3923
03:09:12,030 --> 03:09:13,440
climate goals?
Uh,

3924
03:09:14,460 --> 03:09:16,800
you have all the things we've been 
talking about,

3925
03:09:17,790 --> 03:09:21,430
the virtual certainty that there's going
to be a pandemic at the,

3926
03:09:21,510 --> 03:09:22,830
what I'm talking about,
bioterrorism,

3927
03:09:23,070 --> 03:09:28,070
we're talking about just the sheer fact 
that in 1919 there was a killer flu and 

3928
03:09:28,291 --> 03:09:30,120
there's going to be another killer flew,
right?

3929
03:09:30,121 --> 03:09:31,950
There's just no way.
There's not gonna be another killer flu.

3930
03:09:32,620 --> 03:09:35,880
Um,
and we need,

3931
03:09:35,910 --> 03:09:40,740
we need people and we need people,
people to smart people to change the,

3932
03:09:40,741 --> 03:09:43,530
to optimize the system,
to deal with these kinds of things.

3933
03:09:43,650 --> 03:09:48,650
And if we're promoting religious maniacs
and,

3934
03:09:48,980 --> 03:09:53,980
and crazy narcissists and liars and 
ignoramuses and only those people,

3935
03:09:59,140 --> 03:10:00,490
how could this end will.

3936
03:10:00,830 --> 03:10:05,830
No,
this is just a weird year for 

3937
03:10:05,830 --> 03:10:05,830
heavyweight boxing.
You know,

3938
03:10:05,830 --> 03:10:10,011
they have those weird years for Tony 
happened to be where you could be the 

3939
03:10:11,641 --> 03:10:16,641
heavyweight champion of the world.
They went through a period of time in 

3940
03:10:16,641 --> 03:10:18,150
like the early eighties for Tyson came 
around was a series of like these champs

3941
03:10:18,151 --> 03:10:19,060
that were like,
you know,

3942
03:10:19,080 --> 03:10:21,960
sort of like journeymen fighters and 
then Tyson came along.

3943
03:10:21,990 --> 03:10:24,160
Maybe that's what it is,
but only only with heavyweights,

3944
03:10:24,240 --> 03:10:25,170
right?
Yeah.

3945
03:10:25,171 --> 03:10:26,580
Mostly with heavyweights.
Yeah.

3946
03:10:26,610 --> 03:10:27,840
Yeah.
The lighter weights,

3947
03:10:27,841 --> 03:10:32,841
they were always bad ass,
but I think that maybe that's what's 

3948
03:10:32,841 --> 03:10:33,090
going on.
Maybe we need to have this bad season,

3949
03:10:33,350 --> 03:10:38,350
get the season out of our way,
realize the danger of having an inept 

3950
03:10:38,350 --> 03:10:42,891
person in office,
whether it's a liar or a to hates money 

3951
03:10:42,891 --> 03:10:42,891
or,
or,

3952
03:10:42,950 --> 03:10:46,410
or trump or whoever it is.
Just go through it and realize how silly

3953
03:10:46,411 --> 03:10:48,690
it is that we have it set up this way 
still.

3954
03:10:48,980 --> 03:10:51,510
Yeah.
Except people thought that of Hitler.

3955
03:10:52,170 --> 03:10:57,170
I mean,
this is any comparison to Hitler 

3956
03:10:57,170 --> 03:10:57,170
obviously brands you as a,
um,

3957
03:10:57,170 --> 03:10:58,140
an exaggerator but

3958
03:10:59,320 --> 03:11:04,320
they thought let them get in there and 
fuck it up and then we'll have somebody 

3959
03:11:04,320 --> 03:11:04,320
better.
Hitler was a,

3960
03:11:04,320 --> 03:11:04,320
a

3961
03:11:04,320 --> 03:11:05,930
comic figure for awhile,
for a good long while.

3962
03:11:05,931 --> 03:11:10,931
And people were including the American 
press were incredibly slow to recognize 

3963
03:11:12,620 --> 03:11:14,870
what a sinister character he was.
And he was,

3964
03:11:14,900 --> 03:11:18,800
he was considered a buffoon and a.
and there was,

3965
03:11:18,801 --> 03:11:19,640
you know,
there was like a,

3966
03:11:20,200 --> 03:11:20,600
Oh,
this is,

3967
03:11:20,601 --> 03:11:23,840
maybe Jamie can find this.
I think it was home and garden.

3968
03:11:24,110 --> 03:11:25,880
I think it was homeland,
it house in home and garden,

3969
03:11:26,690 --> 03:11:27,890
you know,
there was a,

3970
03:11:28,070 --> 03:11:30,970
a,
like a write up on his,

3971
03:11:30,971 --> 03:11:34,080
you know,
Eagle's nest or his house that was just,

3972
03:11:34,270 --> 03:11:37,420
just this pure puff piece of,
of,

3973
03:11:38,060 --> 03:11:43,060
you know,
Hitler love in our architectural 

3974
03:11:43,060 --> 03:11:44,410
magazine.
I'm at home with the fuel.

3975
03:11:45,230 --> 03:11:47,070
I think this is it.
This is a,

3976
03:11:47,250 --> 03:11:48,980
was like a guardian right up under 
something.

3977
03:11:49,130 --> 03:11:50,630
Homes and gardens.
Yeah.

3978
03:11:50,990 --> 03:11:52,750
So that people can see the,
um,

3979
03:11:52,850 --> 03:11:57,850
the actual pages.
I think they're pdfs online of the 

3980
03:11:57,850 --> 03:11:57,850
actual pages of the article.

3981
03:11:57,850 --> 03:12:00,140
But this is probably a,
the actual text of the article.

3982
03:12:00,560 --> 03:12:01,520
But it's hilarious.
It's just,

3983
03:12:01,521 --> 03:12:03,560
you know,
like architectural digest does,

3984
03:12:03,561 --> 03:12:06,140
you know,
the Eagle's nest and.

3985
03:12:06,410 --> 03:12:11,410
But it's at a time where it's not too 
far away from a moment where it should 

3986
03:12:11,431 --> 03:12:16,431
have been absolutely obvious to every 
thinking person that this guy was going 

3987
03:12:16,431 --> 03:12:18,470
to try to conquer the world for evil.
Right?

3988
03:12:20,360 --> 03:12:23,450
And yet it was not obvious.
And,

3989
03:12:23,570 --> 03:12:25,910
and when you look at how it was not 
obvious,

3990
03:12:25,911 --> 03:12:27,170
it's pretty humble.
I mean,

3991
03:12:27,171 --> 03:12:27,950
you,
you don't know,

3992
03:12:27,951 --> 03:12:32,951
you would have been necessarily 
different because up until this 

3993
03:12:32,951 --> 03:12:36,671
conversation practically,
I've been looking at trump as a clown.

3994
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:39,270
Right?
But how,

3995
03:12:39,500 --> 03:12:40,580
how,
what,

3996
03:12:40,581 --> 03:12:44,840
what would this clown actually do with 
the power of the presidency?

3997
03:12:44,990 --> 03:12:45,410
I,
you know,

3998
03:12:45,500 --> 03:12:47,180
I don't know that he couldn't be.
I mean,

3999
03:12:47,181 --> 03:12:52,181
he's,
he's given voice to a kind of 

4000
03:12:52,181 --> 03:12:53,150
authoritarianism that,
you know,

4001
03:12:53,180 --> 03:12:55,370
some people are,
his enemies are noticing,

4002
03:12:55,371 --> 03:12:58,520
his friends are discounting,
but he's talked about,

4003
03:12:58,580 --> 03:13:00,170
you know,
going after the press.

4004
03:13:00,170 --> 03:13:02,330
And I mean,
he's bragged about how many people,

4005
03:13:02,331 --> 03:13:03,770
he's gonna Torture,
right?

4006
03:13:04,190 --> 03:13:04,980
He's talked about,
you know,

4007
03:13:04,981 --> 03:13:09,981
well of course we're gonna would do 
waterboarding and we're going to do 

4008
03:13:09,981 --> 03:13:10,520
worse and what maybe will kill the kill 
the families of terrorists.

4009
03:13:10,521 --> 03:13:12,190
Right?
And he told he he,

4010
03:13:12,230 --> 03:13:17,120
but there's a kind of a um,
I mean it's just,

4011
03:13:17,150 --> 03:13:20,300
he's going to make America great again.
He,

4012
03:13:20,360 --> 03:13:25,360
what would he do if he actually had more
power than anyone in the world?

4013
03:13:25,581 --> 03:13:26,990
I think it's,
it's,

4014
03:13:27,780 --> 03:13:32,620
it's a legit question.
The transition from comedy to a,

4015
03:13:32,690 --> 03:13:34,760
Oh my God,
we can't take this back,

4016
03:13:34,850 --> 03:13:38,120
you know,
in anything like a short order,

4017
03:13:39,280 --> 03:13:40,070
you know,
that would be,

4018
03:13:40,310 --> 03:13:45,310
that could well be terrifying.
What do go back to the question of 

4019
03:13:46,161 --> 03:13:51,161
heavyweights?
Why do you think you could be a fake 

4020
03:13:51,161 --> 03:13:51,161
heavyweight and not a fake

4021
03:13:51,161 --> 03:13:54,890
middleware?
There's not that many really good 

4022
03:13:54,890 --> 03:13:59,131
athletes.
They go to boxing when they really 

4023
03:13:59,131 --> 03:14:01,261
large.
They tend to go to football or 

4024
03:14:01,261 --> 03:14:01,261
interesting or basketball after really 
tall.

4025
03:14:01,261 --> 03:14:01,600
It's like,
um,

4026
03:14:02,200 --> 03:14:06,610
if you look at the amount of money that 
like guys in the NBA can make or guys in

4027
03:14:06,611 --> 03:14:07,910
the NFL can make.
I mean,

4028
03:14:07,960 --> 03:14:10,300
they're really top level guys can make a
tremendous amount of money.

4029
03:14:10,301 --> 03:14:13,030
So when you get to really super athlete 
guys,

4030
03:14:13,450 --> 03:14:18,450
um,
they tend to gravitate towards the big 

4031
03:14:18,450 --> 03:14:18,450
name.
I mean,

4032
03:14:18,450 --> 03:14:18,450
there's no bigger name sport than 
football.

4033
03:14:18,450 --> 03:14:23,140
So getting someone to abandoned the 
whole team thing and having the balls to

4034
03:14:23,141 --> 03:14:28,141
go one on one in a cage and having that 
mentality that's also very different 

4035
03:14:28,141 --> 03:14:30,850
because it's not necessarily the 
smartest thing to do,

4036
03:14:31,150 --> 03:14:36,150
but it's the most challenging thing to 
do and there's some really smart people 

4037
03:14:36,150 --> 03:14:36,150
that do it.

4038
03:14:36,150 --> 03:14:39,750
So even though cage fighting isn't,
it's not the safest way to get through 

4039
03:14:39,750 --> 03:14:44,101
life for a lot of people that engage in 
it and it becomes like an extreme,

4040
03:14:45,130 --> 03:14:48,640
extremely difficult pursuit and then 
that's what it becomes to them,

4041
03:14:49,210 --> 03:14:50,860
you know?
And in the heavyweight division,

4042
03:14:52,150 --> 03:14:55,690
those guys were being lured into other 
ways and boxing was just kind of went in

4043
03:14:55,691 --> 03:14:58,150
through like a hit,
a peak and a valley when Ali.

4044
03:14:58,151 --> 03:14:59,200
And then it went.
Larry Holmes,

4045
03:14:59,440 --> 03:15:04,440
Larry Holmes was amazing.
People didn't appreciate him for how 

4046
03:15:04,440 --> 03:15:07,561
good he was.
So that doesn't have the middleweight 

4047
03:15:07,561 --> 03:15:10,260
level.
That was not the same competition for 

4048
03:15:10,260 --> 03:15:12,511
that kind of athlete.
It will for a little dinky little lulls 

4049
03:15:12,511 --> 03:15:13,030
in the middleweight division,
but it's always pretty fucking strong.

4050
03:15:13,090 --> 03:15:13,750
But I mean,
why?

4051
03:15:13,840 --> 03:15:18,840
Why wouldn't you have the same 
competition for the high level athlete 

4052
03:15:19,121 --> 03:15:24,121
at one 65 weight?
I mean there's just not our favorite 

4053
03:15:24,121 --> 03:15:25,110
sports or require bigger people.
Yeah.

4054
03:15:25,111 --> 03:15:25,180
Bowling,

4055
03:15:25,220 --> 03:15:29,550
basketball and football and baseball 
doesn't really apply here.

4056
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:32,340
The amount of cultures that produce 
heavyweights,

4057
03:15:32,430 --> 03:15:37,430
first of all are fairly limited.
Like very few heavyweights have come 

4058
03:15:37,430 --> 03:15:42,111
from Asia except a polynesian guys,
which I guess is kind of Asian.

4059
03:15:42,840 --> 03:15:45,030
But like uh,
like Samoans,

4060
03:15:45,031 --> 03:15:47,490
samoans known to be great for.
But giant,

4061
03:15:47,491 --> 03:15:52,491
sturdy heavyweights.
Like the Chinese don't really produce 

4062
03:15:52,491 --> 03:15:52,910
them that often,
so they don't.

4063
03:15:52,960 --> 03:15:55,980
The people don't get that big in Japan.
Sumo,

4064
03:15:55,981 --> 03:15:57,450
but yeah,
but they're very fat.

4065
03:15:57,780 --> 03:16:02,780
There's never been like a guy who looks 
like Mike Tyson that came out of Japan 

4066
03:16:02,780 --> 03:16:04,830
and the eighties,
you know what I mean?

4067
03:16:05,520 --> 03:16:09,180
We're seeing more of that now.
But I mean if we had a guy that was like

4068
03:16:09,181 --> 03:16:12,420
a Japanese version of Mike Tyson just to
super fast,

4069
03:16:12,421 --> 03:16:15,120
blinding knockout fighter with a fucking
head,

4070
03:16:15,121 --> 03:16:20,121
like a brick wall and the giant neck 
that started above his ears and went 

4071
03:16:20,121 --> 03:16:20,121
down to his traps.

4072
03:16:20,121 --> 03:16:22,230
You remember Tyson when he first came on
the scene,

4073
03:16:22,740 --> 03:16:27,740
he was unbelievably terrifying,
so there was never been a Japanese 

4074
03:16:27,740 --> 03:16:28,380
person that has that kind of physical 
strength,

4075
03:16:28,680 --> 03:16:33,680
so I think it's limited genetically and 
I think in a lot of the competitive 

4076
03:16:34,051 --> 03:16:39,051
boxing countries that tend to be poor 
countries and I think also in a lot of 

4077
03:16:39,051 --> 03:16:43,341
poor countries you'll see much smaller 
men like you'll see like some some 

4078
03:16:43,341 --> 03:16:46,350
manner like flyweights,
like it's very rare you find an American

4079
03:16:46,351 --> 03:16:48,570
flyweight.
Most Americans are larger.

4080
03:16:48,571 --> 03:16:51,060
They get more food.
I think it probably has a lot to do with

4081
03:16:51,061 --> 03:16:56,061
it or just just the genetics in general.
But like South America produces a lot of

4082
03:16:56,360 --> 03:17:00,750
flyweights like the Philippines.
Of course we're manny Pacquiao came from

4083
03:17:00,751 --> 03:17:05,751
him.
He was like eight weight classes lower 

4084
03:17:05,751 --> 03:17:07,851
when he first started and if you're a 
great athlete at at 120 pounds or 130 

4085
03:17:07,851 --> 03:17:07,851
minutes.

4086
03:17:07,851 --> 03:17:09,300
Not a lot of sports.
Yeah.

4087
03:17:09,301 --> 03:17:11,130
What else can you do?
Especially if you read.

4088
03:17:11,340 --> 03:17:14,730
Some of these guys are really tiny,
but they're amazing boxers,

4089
03:17:14,970 --> 03:17:15,640
like,
um,

4090
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:18,820
I mean there's a ton of them,
but the United States,

4091
03:17:19,050 --> 03:17:24,050
Johnny Tapio was a smaller guy.
I think what it would wait to Johnny 

4092
03:17:24,050 --> 03:17:28,640
Tappia fight out.
So you find that there was some 

4093
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:29,040
lightweight guys that were just so 
incredible.

4094
03:17:29,041 --> 03:17:31,500
They brought so much attention to those 
divisions,

4095
03:17:31,501 --> 03:17:36,501
but there was never.
This is my little peaks and valleys 

4096
03:17:36,501 --> 03:17:37,130
where greatness comes in and people have
to recover and the new people come along

4097
03:17:37,131 --> 03:17:39,450
with are great,
but there's always been pretty steady.

4098
03:17:40,280 --> 03:17:43,020
What did he fight at?
Super Flyway?

4099
03:17:43,080 --> 03:17:45,300
Yeah.
So he was one of the rare Americans,

4100
03:17:45,900 --> 03:17:50,900
Mexican American Johnny Tap.
He was a bad motherfucker super fly 

4101
03:17:50,900 --> 03:17:50,900
away.
Which is,

4102
03:17:50,900 --> 03:17:52,590
what is that like one slash 26 or 
something?

4103
03:17:52,650 --> 03:17:53,760
Maybe 1:30.

4104
03:17:56,010 --> 03:17:57,880
I don't even know what that [inaudible] 
Bantam weight.

4105
03:17:57,881 --> 03:17:59,880
I think it's in the UFC.
It's different.

4106
03:17:59,910 --> 03:18:03,660
There's different weight classes.
One hundred,

4107
03:18:03,661 --> 03:18:05,490
15 pounds.
Wow.

4108
03:18:05,910 --> 03:18:07,380
Crazy.
That was tiny.

4109
03:18:07,430 --> 03:18:09,690
Yeah.
And he was a wild,

4110
03:18:09,691 --> 03:18:12,240
wild guy.
They did a documentary about him.

4111
03:18:12,300 --> 03:18:13,650
How did he do?
He died.

4112
03:18:13,790 --> 03:18:14,880
Yeah,
he died.

4113
03:18:15,690 --> 03:18:20,690
I don't remember,
but he had a lot of problems with drugs 

4114
03:18:20,690 --> 03:18:24,351
and crime and craziness and he had like 
Mi Vida loca tattooed on his chest.

4115
03:18:27,200 --> 03:18:30,720
I might get you to the presidency now.
He was a wild man,

4116
03:18:30,810 --> 03:18:33,960
but just an amazing fighter to watch.
So much fun.

4117
03:18:34,080 --> 03:18:34,990
But I think,
you know,

4118
03:18:35,540 --> 03:18:39,360
put in where the bigger people are,
you know,

4119
03:18:39,400 --> 03:18:44,400
I just think they tend to gravitate 
towards other sports and I think that's 

4120
03:18:44,400 --> 03:18:46,170
all it is.
And boxing like always like one 60,

4121
03:18:46,171 --> 03:18:48,430
1:47
and one [inaudible] always been like the

4122
03:18:48,431 --> 03:18:53,431
promised land.
That's sugar ray Leonard and Marvin 

4123
03:18:53,431 --> 03:18:53,431
Hagler.

4124
03:18:53,431 --> 03:18:53,890
Roberto Duran.
I'm a floyd mayweather's in there.

4125
03:18:53,891 --> 03:18:55,270
Sure.
Shane Mosley's in there.

4126
03:18:55,300 --> 03:18:58,780
So many guys are in that mix.
That's the sweet spot.

4127
03:18:58,910 --> 03:19:03,250
That's always has been this great 
fighters in pretty much every class.

4128
03:19:03,360 --> 03:19:05,580
Strength and speed that.
Yeah.

4129
03:19:05,770 --> 03:19:08,170
I think you see in the UFC to.
There's um,

4130
03:19:08,550 --> 03:19:13,550
well I think,
well when it comes to just freak 

4131
03:19:13,550 --> 03:19:16,351
movements,
I always think that the flyweights in 

4132
03:19:16,351 --> 03:19:16,351
the Bantam weight,
it's 25 and 35,

4133
03:19:16,351 --> 03:19:18,790
so the fastest and the best coding like 
20 percent faster than.

4134
03:19:19,050 --> 03:19:20,530
Yeah.
But I always wonder like,

4135
03:19:20,531 --> 03:19:25,531
how much of that is because they're just
not affected by gravity as much because 

4136
03:19:25,531 --> 03:19:29,051
that was effected by the,
the blows that are being landed by the 

4137
03:19:29,051 --> 03:19:29,051
other guy.
It's like,

4138
03:19:29,051 --> 03:19:30,160
it's.
Unless it's mighty mouse.

4139
03:19:30,370 --> 03:19:34,060
Mighty mouse is the one of the few guys 
in that division that consistently stops

4140
03:19:34,061 --> 03:19:39,061
people.
Did you see his last fight with Henry 

4141
03:19:39,061 --> 03:19:39,061
Cejudo?

4142
03:19:39,061 --> 03:19:39,061
No,
it was,

4143
03:19:39,061 --> 03:19:40,390
it was incredible.
It was insane.

4144
03:19:40,690 --> 03:19:41,350
I mean,
he,

4145
03:19:41,351 --> 03:19:42,910
um,
he fought this Guy Henry,

4146
03:19:42,911 --> 03:19:47,911
so who does an Olympic gold medalist,
one of the best wrestlers to ever 

4147
03:19:47,911 --> 03:19:47,911
compete in MMA.
I mean,

4148
03:19:47,911 --> 03:19:50,140
he is just a stud wrestler and a really 
good kickboxer too.

4149
03:19:50,590 --> 03:19:55,590
And mighty mouse clenched up with them 
and hit them with these knees to the 

4150
03:19:55,590 --> 03:19:57,700
body that we're just out of this world 
technical.

4151
03:19:57,730 --> 03:19:59,810
Just so perfect.
No wind up,

4152
03:19:59,811 --> 03:20:04,811
no slop.
Just drilled them in on each side with 

4153
03:20:04,811 --> 03:20:05,440
perfect precision and he just crumbled.
He was like,

4154
03:20:05,441 --> 03:20:08,950
what the fuck?
He got the victory on knees to the body,

4155
03:20:08,980 --> 03:20:12,400
just need the shit out of his body and 
eat them in the face.

4156
03:20:12,670 --> 03:20:17,670
But it was the fluidity of the way.
Who is moving his knees in the perfect 

4157
03:20:17,670 --> 03:20:18,280
position?
I mean,

4158
03:20:19,060 --> 03:20:22,240
it was,
there were so perfectly oiled,

4159
03:20:22,450 --> 03:20:25,930
like everything was going down a path 
that it had gotten a million times,

4160
03:20:25,940 --> 03:20:28,320
which just like a tight clench or.

4161
03:20:28,360 --> 03:20:29,320
Oh yeah,
but it was,

4162
03:20:29,560 --> 03:20:30,820
it was better than I've ever seen.
I mean,

4163
03:20:30,930 --> 03:20:33,840
it was without a doubt the most.
One of the most.

4164
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:38,880
Well there's two,
there's another one in between Anderson 

4165
03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:41,220
Silva and rich Franklin,
but that was like a prolong brutal beat 

4166
03:20:41,220 --> 03:20:41,860
down where Anderson just keep beating 
him up,

4167
03:20:41,950 --> 03:20:43,780
beating him up in the clench and broke 
his nose.

4168
03:20:43,880 --> 03:20:45,890
Is that.
There's one where uh,

4169
03:20:47,110 --> 03:20:47,720
yeah,
I,

4170
03:20:47,721 --> 03:20:50,290
I saw,
I remember victor was at Wildman or,

4171
03:20:50,350 --> 03:20:55,350
or was it silver?
I can't remember if someone just won on 

4172
03:20:55,350 --> 03:20:57,010
a knee to the chest against someone who 
was.

4173
03:20:57,070 --> 03:20:58,540
Can you,
can you need someone who's,

4174
03:20:59,020 --> 03:21:00,450
who's down?
It was jail son and.

4175
03:21:00,460 --> 03:21:01,480
Yeah.
Anderson Silva.

4176
03:21:01,620 --> 03:21:02,380
Yeah.
Yeah,

4177
03:21:02,390 --> 03:21:02,860
yeah,
yeah.

4178
03:21:02,861 --> 03:21:04,550
That was pretty brutal.
What,

4179
03:21:04,930 --> 03:21:07,580
what mighty mouse did in this fight.
That was crazy.

4180
03:21:07,581 --> 03:21:11,170
It was the precision of the placement of
the knees and how quick they came.

4181
03:21:11,170 --> 03:21:12,250
Just Bam,
Bam,

4182
03:21:12,251 --> 03:21:12,730
Bam,
Bam.

4183
03:21:12,731 --> 03:21:14,420
Just controlled him and he's 
controlling.

4184
03:21:14,421 --> 03:21:16,330
Your guy was an Olympic gold medalist 
wrestler,

4185
03:21:16,331 --> 03:21:19,510
just a stud wrestler.
It was really pretty impressive stuff.

4186
03:21:19,511 --> 03:21:22,120
Like really,
really amazing sharp technique.

4187
03:21:22,330 --> 03:21:24,400
But I wonder what could a heavyweight 
even move like that?

4188
03:21:25,230 --> 03:21:26,020
Yeah,
probably not.

4189
03:21:26,270 --> 03:21:26,650
No,
I mean,

4190
03:21:26,680 --> 03:21:30,040
as you get bigger,
there are just things you can't do.

4191
03:21:30,090 --> 03:21:35,090
It clearly is.
There's a limit to the size you can be 

4192
03:21:36,700 --> 03:21:40,390
and be not only athletic,
but even ambulatory.

4193
03:21:40,450 --> 03:21:40,960
I mean,
you can't,

4194
03:21:40,961 --> 03:21:44,050
you couldn't have a 30 foot tall person 
who could walk around and,

4195
03:21:44,430 --> 03:21:45,920
you know,
your bones would break and,

4196
03:21:45,921 --> 03:21:46,090
you

4197
03:21:46,220 --> 03:21:48,140
know,
because because mass goes up,

4198
03:21:48,190 --> 03:21:50,750
but with a cube of,
um,

4199
03:21:51,530 --> 03:21:54,120
just the side.
So it's why it's why if you,

4200
03:21:54,140 --> 03:21:59,140
um,
a part of ammunition that kind of a 

4201
03:21:59,140 --> 03:21:59,160
different point.
But like if you,

4202
03:21:59,190 --> 03:22:03,590
if you could drop an ant off the empire 
state building and it'll,

4203
03:22:04,280 --> 03:22:09,280
it's,
it'll fall and hit the ground and be 

4204
03:22:09,280 --> 03:22:12,101
fine.
If you dropped a horse off the empire 

4205
03:22:12,101 --> 03:22:12,101
state building,
it's going to,

4206
03:22:12,101 --> 03:22:12,101
you know,
be illiquid horse.

4207
03:22:12,101 --> 03:22:13,370
Um,
it's a,

4208
03:22:13,371 --> 03:22:14,480
uh,
I mean they are,

4209
03:22:14,620 --> 03:22:15,460
you have,
you know,

4210
03:22:15,520 --> 03:22:19,010
kind of the air resistance with surface 
area,

4211
03:22:20,990 --> 03:22:21,790
uh,
the,

4212
03:22:21,860 --> 03:22:23,680
the air resistance goes up with,
by,

4213
03:22:23,730 --> 03:22:26,360
by the square,
the surface area,

4214
03:22:26,600 --> 03:22:30,650
so,
but that doesn't counteract for the mass

4215
03:22:30,651 --> 03:22:32,420
going up with a cube,
the volume.

4216
03:22:32,440 --> 03:22:34,880
So,
so the horse is bigger,

4217
03:22:34,881 --> 03:22:39,881
you'd think it might be able to kind of 
act like a wing more as much as the 

4218
03:22:39,881 --> 03:22:39,881
atwood.

4219
03:22:39,881 --> 03:22:41,270
He has got a lot of air resistance is 
giant.

4220
03:22:41,271 --> 03:22:43,010
It's always a horse,
but it's,

4221
03:22:43,011 --> 03:22:44,350
um,
it's,

4222
03:22:44,480 --> 03:22:46,850
it's mass is going up with,
with a cube of.

4223
03:22:46,851 --> 03:22:50,180
It's with the cube of its size.
So it's um,

4224
03:22:51,010 --> 03:22:56,010
uh,
the air doesn't resist this fall at all 

4225
03:22:56,010 --> 03:22:56,010
compared to them what it's doing for an 
end.

4226
03:22:56,660 --> 03:22:57,420
Um,
but yeah,

4227
03:22:57,421 --> 03:22:59,240
but yeah,
we haven't the limit on this.

4228
03:22:59,270 --> 03:23:01,220
This is one function,
like if you,

4229
03:23:01,250 --> 03:23:06,250
if you're going to engineer the super 
athlete and if we're going to give you 

4230
03:23:06,250 --> 03:23:09,791
like a chimpanzee muscle proteins or 
whatever to make you super explosive and

4231
03:23:09,951 --> 03:23:11,660
strong,
um,

4232
03:23:12,140 --> 03:23:13,820
you'd have to get that right with your,
you know,

4233
03:23:13,821 --> 03:23:18,821
your connective tissue and your bones 
and everything else because you could 

4234
03:23:18,821 --> 03:23:19,720
rip your own arm off with your holistic 
moves.

4235
03:23:22,110 --> 03:23:27,110
Imagine if you had chimps strength and 
human tendencies like good luck once you

4236
03:23:28,431 --> 03:23:30,950
take your own arm off and beat the 
person with it.

4237
03:23:31,630 --> 03:23:36,630
Well use.
I'm sure you saw that video of the 

4238
03:23:36,630 --> 03:23:36,630
little boy who got into the gorilla 
cage.

4239
03:23:36,630 --> 03:23:38,480
Yeah.
Shoot the gorilla.

4240
03:23:39,260 --> 03:23:41,270
That seemed.
I heard a lot of.

4241
03:23:41,271 --> 03:23:43,460
I didn't pay a lot of attention to the 
commentary,

4242
03:23:43,461 --> 03:23:47,030
but it seemed pretty straightforward to 
me.

4243
03:23:47,210 --> 03:23:48,650
I mean,
they have to shoot the gorilla.

4244
03:23:48,651 --> 03:23:51,230
Yeah.
Like I'm with the zoo on that one.

4245
03:23:51,231 --> 03:23:54,620
I missed.
Totally tragic and it's how is the zoo?

4246
03:23:55,160 --> 03:24:00,160
The zoo was certainly culpable for 
having an enclosure that a three year 

4247
03:24:00,160 --> 03:24:02,030
old or four year old can get into.
Right?

4248
03:24:02,031 --> 03:24:03,020
I.
How the hell did that happen?

4249
03:24:03,021 --> 03:24:06,440
But.
So you've got to fix that and um,

4250
03:24:06,650 --> 03:24:11,650
but it's totally tragic,
but once you have a 400 pound gorilla 

4251
03:24:11,650 --> 03:24:15,191
that has a human child and is not 
letting it go and just kind of dragging 

4252
03:24:15,921 --> 03:24:17,280
it around,
I mean,

4253
03:24:17,320 --> 03:24:19,190
it wasn't looking at aggressive toward 
the child,

4254
03:24:19,191 --> 03:24:21,350
but it just,
the fact that it moved it around,

4255
03:24:21,351 --> 03:24:24,950
would that kind of force who then,
who knows what was going to happen?

4256
03:24:24,950 --> 03:24:29,950
I mean,
it looked like you had to end that as 

4257
03:24:29,950 --> 03:24:32,531
quickly as possible.
We have to assume that that girl is 

4258
03:24:32,531 --> 03:24:32,930
going to know that a baby's more fragile
than a baby gorilla.

4259
03:24:33,080 --> 03:24:34,910
We'd have to assume.
I don't assume anything.

4260
03:24:34,950 --> 03:24:36,080
You can't say no,
no.

4261
03:24:36,081 --> 03:24:41,081
There's no way I could know.
I never experienced that have just 

4262
03:24:41,081 --> 03:24:42,710
ripped or torn his head off easily.
Accidentally.

4263
03:24:42,770 --> 03:24:43,680
Oh yeah.
Easily.

4264
03:24:44,210 --> 03:24:45,510
No.
Was totally tragic.

4265
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:47,870
And I'm sure the,
the,

4266
03:24:47,880 --> 03:24:52,880
uh,
the parents and this and the zoo are 

4267
03:24:52,880 --> 03:24:54,440
reaping sufficient criticism.
But um,

4268
03:24:54,720 --> 03:24:57,870
once that situation is unfolding,
I think,

4269
03:24:57,960 --> 03:25:02,960
I mean,
you can't tranquilizer because it 

4270
03:25:02,960 --> 03:25:04,580
doesn't work fast enough.
So I might grab a,

4271
03:25:04,790 --> 03:25:08,400
a fear and it's being attacked.
Jesus Christ.

4272
03:25:08,401 --> 03:25:10,440
That's scary though,
but if it was your kid,

4273
03:25:10,740 --> 03:25:15,360
I think he'd probably shoot that fucking
gorilla if it was your kid.

4274
03:25:15,910 --> 03:25:18,210
Yeah.
It's um.

4275
03:25:18,290 --> 03:25:23,070
I mean if more people were carrying guns
you where it was in Cincinnati,

4276
03:25:23,071 --> 03:25:28,071
right.
If that had been in Texas a property 

4277
03:25:28,071 --> 03:25:29,160
with some innocent bystander who was 
going to take the law into his own hands

4278
03:25:29,170 --> 03:25:34,170
and Chuck Norris plants.
I'm prayed over the open fire.

4279
03:25:36,900 --> 03:25:38,530
Yeah.
It's,

4280
03:25:38,820 --> 03:25:43,820
I saw some horrible comments to where 
people like they should just shot the 

4281
03:25:43,820 --> 03:25:44,460
parents while they were at it.
I'm like,

4282
03:25:44,490 --> 03:25:46,560
well,
it's easy to be outraged.

4283
03:25:46,560 --> 03:25:48,900
Somebody fucked out.
It's a little kid.

4284
03:25:49,350 --> 03:25:54,350
Shouldn't have been able to get in.
First of all this you gotta see gorilla 

4285
03:25:54,350 --> 03:25:54,720
and closure.
It is an architectural failing.

4286
03:25:54,800 --> 03:25:56,310
They should,
it should be impossible.

4287
03:25:56,550 --> 03:26:01,550
It's not like,
it's not just like a year old could do 

4288
03:26:01,550 --> 03:26:01,550
it.
How could a three year old,

4289
03:26:01,550 --> 03:26:03,970
like it should be impossible for an 
adult to get in there with it,

4290
03:26:04,010 --> 03:26:09,010
with a gorilla would have been.
It's been happening with like pretty 

4291
03:26:09,010 --> 03:26:13,941
regularly lately.
Like guys had been breaking into zoos 

4292
03:26:13,941 --> 03:26:14,970
and it's like some guy tried to kill the
lions recently,

4293
03:26:15,070 --> 03:26:17,250
right?
Jesus Christ.

4294
03:26:17,251 --> 03:26:22,251
I mean,
you gotta realize you gotta a lot of 

4295
03:26:22,251 --> 03:26:22,251
responsibility when you have monsters in
occasion,

4296
03:26:22,251 --> 03:26:26,150
your city,
you can't let babies get in there with 

4297
03:26:26,150 --> 03:26:26,150
them.
I mean,

4298
03:26:26,150 --> 03:26:27,390
that's a gorilla as awesome as it is,
but if it wanted to attack you,

4299
03:26:27,450 --> 03:26:32,450
it's a monstrous beast.
It's a thing with power that you 

4300
03:26:32,761 --> 03:26:34,110
couldn't even fathom.

4301
03:26:34,410 --> 03:26:37,680
A gorilla could literally pick you up 
and throw you.

4302
03:26:37,681 --> 03:26:39,900
Like you could have football.
I mean,

4303
03:26:39,901 --> 03:26:43,020
they can launch you there is so strong.
Oh yeah,

4304
03:26:43,200 --> 03:26:43,880
don't do it.
Didn't we?

4305
03:26:43,980 --> 03:26:48,980
Google it.
They get to be like 500 pounds or 

4306
03:26:48,980 --> 03:26:48,980
something crazy.
Yeah.

4307
03:26:48,980 --> 03:26:50,210
Well this was like 400 pounds,
but not,

4308
03:26:50,250 --> 03:26:52,380
but not.
Not Four hundred pounds,

4309
03:26:52,381 --> 03:26:57,381
like a Boston sap.
Four hundred pounds when he was 300 

4310
03:26:57,381 --> 03:27:00,861
pounds,
but it's like a 300 pound gorilla is 

4311
03:27:00,861 --> 03:27:01,150
much stronger than Bob Sapp.
Yeah.

4312
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:05,460
They're not equivalent pounds.
It's unfathomable.

4313
03:27:05,790 --> 03:27:10,790
The amount of physical strength and must
just sucks that they keep them in zoos 

4314
03:27:10,790 --> 03:27:13,200
in the first place.
It sucks that they had to kill him,

4315
03:27:13,590 --> 03:27:17,040
but it really sucks that they keep doing
the zoo thing with smart stuff,

4316
03:27:17,550 --> 03:27:19,350
like if you want to have giraffes in the
zoo.

4317
03:27:19,590 --> 03:27:24,590
And I had a whole bit about it that they
look like real relaxed because there's 

4318
03:27:24,590 --> 03:27:24,590
no lions around,
you know,

4319
03:27:24,590 --> 03:27:26,070
like they don't care,
they just give them some food.

4320
03:27:26,400 --> 03:27:31,400
But there's some animals that look 
tortured and primates in particular,

4321
03:27:31,860 --> 03:27:36,860
they just look so freaked out in this 
enclosure and this weird place where 

4322
03:27:36,860 --> 03:27:41,571
people are staring at them.
They're pacing and trying to get away 

4323
03:27:41,571 --> 03:27:41,571
from people's gazes.
It's just,

4324
03:27:41,571 --> 03:27:42,070
I think it's very,

4325
03:27:42,070 --> 03:27:43,720
very stressful to them.
I think.

4326
03:27:43,770 --> 03:27:46,780
Well,
it's a hard question,

4327
03:27:47,130 --> 03:27:52,130
uh,
of what to do given certainly these 

4328
03:27:52,130 --> 03:27:53,020
species or are on the verge of 
extinction.

4329
03:27:53,050 --> 03:27:54,910
Right?
So like how do you preserve them?

4330
03:27:55,570 --> 03:28:00,570
I mean,
you obviously you can preserve them in 

4331
03:28:00,570 --> 03:28:00,570
all kinds of technical ways,
like,

4332
03:28:00,570 --> 03:28:00,570
like,
you know,

4333
03:28:00,570 --> 03:28:05,460
have their DNA frozen and,
and be able to reboot them at a certain 

4334
03:28:05,460 --> 03:28:05,710
point when we,
when we haven't,

4335
03:28:06,940 --> 03:28:09,100
when we figured out how to preserve 
their habitat.

4336
03:28:09,101 --> 03:28:10,490
But the,
um,

4337
03:28:11,710 --> 03:28:12,260
I mean,
I,

4338
03:28:12,261 --> 03:28:14,230
I think that I got to think there's a 
role for,

4339
03:28:14,470 --> 03:28:17,080
for good zoos to,
to get it because you also,

4340
03:28:17,081 --> 03:28:22,081
you just want to maintain the public's 
connection to these animals because the 

4341
03:28:22,781 --> 03:28:27,781
decision to destroy habitat is made by 
people who don't really care about the 

4342
03:28:30,370 --> 03:28:31,840
prospects of extinction.
Right.

4343
03:28:32,290 --> 03:28:37,290
It's a very good point when you present 
it that way because the people that are 

4344
03:28:37,290 --> 03:28:40,141
over there are face,
I mean the people that are over in 

4345
03:28:40,141 --> 03:28:43,171
Africa trying to save gorillas and 
chimps and I mean that is an 

4346
03:28:43,171 --> 03:28:47,251
unbelievably difficult struggle and they
might not make it when there's a real 

4347
03:28:47,251 --> 03:28:51,241
concern that if there was no regulation 
at all and there was no one telling 

4348
03:28:51,241 --> 03:28:53,770
anybody what to do,
but they could just go in there and wipe

4349
03:28:53,771 --> 03:28:54,310
them all out.

4350
03:28:54,460 --> 03:28:59,460
Well,
that's mean historically that's what 

4351
03:28:59,460 --> 03:28:59,460
we've done.
Right?

4352
03:28:59,460 --> 03:28:59,460
So if any,
with kind of everything that we profited

4353
03:28:59,460 --> 03:29:02,200
from anything that you can make money 
off of anything that you can.

4354
03:29:02,570 --> 03:29:03,310
I mean the,
the,

4355
03:29:03,400 --> 03:29:06,940
I don't know what the hell they use 
chimps and gorillas for.

4356
03:29:07,330 --> 03:29:09,720
Well there's the whole trade.
Well,

4357
03:29:09,721 --> 03:29:09,990
no,
they,

4358
03:29:10,090 --> 03:29:11,890
they just,
I mean there's bushmeat they eat them,

4359
03:29:12,170 --> 03:29:14,650
but then there's the,
why do they call it bushmeat?

4360
03:29:14,960 --> 03:29:16,150
Well there's,
you go into the Bush,

4361
03:29:16,151 --> 03:29:19,030
you go into it's content,
just shoot everything.

4362
03:29:19,390 --> 03:29:19,840
Well,
it's just,

4363
03:29:19,900 --> 03:29:22,690
it's just your,
they're hunting species that you know,

4364
03:29:22,930 --> 03:29:25,770
you don't think of is food species,
but they're,

4365
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:27,880
you know,
they're eating monkeys and gorillas and,

4366
03:29:27,970 --> 03:29:29,580
and that's why they call it bushmeat.
Well,

4367
03:29:29,590 --> 03:29:30,430
I mean,
bushes.

4368
03:29:30,460 --> 03:29:35,200
They call bushes like the jungle.
So it's um,

4369
03:29:36,040 --> 03:29:38,400
it's just hunting species that are,
that are,

4370
03:29:38,450 --> 03:29:39,520
they're not,
they're not.

4371
03:29:39,530 --> 03:29:40,440
Um,
the,

4372
03:29:40,480 --> 03:29:43,900
there's the other component of it which 
is they're like,

4373
03:29:43,910 --> 03:29:44,290
you know,
the,

4374
03:29:44,400 --> 03:29:49,400
the crazy ideas that the Chinese have 
about the medicinal properties of tiger 

4375
03:29:49,400 --> 03:29:49,960
bone,
wine writer,

4376
03:29:49,961 --> 03:29:54,961
Rhino Horn or so let's say you have 
these species that are being hunted by 

4377
03:29:54,961 --> 03:29:56,810
poachers because there's a market for 
their,

4378
03:29:56,811 --> 03:29:58,300
um,
their parts,

4379
03:29:58,810 --> 03:30:00,060
um,
you know,

4380
03:30:00,070 --> 03:30:02,200
like I the ivory trade,
but the,

4381
03:30:02,201 --> 03:30:03,090
um,
now,

4382
03:30:03,160 --> 03:30:08,160
but some,
some people just eat species that are 

4383
03:30:08,160 --> 03:30:10,591
endangered to just the deterrent.
Bushmeat is always associated with 

4384
03:30:10,591 --> 03:30:11,560
primates for some reason.
I was always trying to figure out why.

4385
03:30:12,210 --> 03:30:13,660
I don't know,
is that true?

4386
03:30:13,750 --> 03:30:15,160
No,
probably not.

4387
03:30:15,390 --> 03:30:20,390
Maybe my mind was when I read about 
people eating chips and how common it 

4388
03:30:21,251 --> 03:30:26,251
was,
my friend Steve Rinella did a show in 

4389
03:30:26,251 --> 03:30:29,701
Bolivia where they shot and they ate a 
monkey and it's so weird to watch these 

4390
03:30:31,541 --> 03:30:35,140
people.
Yanomami the Yanomami,

4391
03:30:35,480 --> 03:30:40,480
uh,
they live in Bolivia and they live in 

4392
03:30:40,480 --> 03:30:41,690
very much like the way they probably 
live hundreds of years ago.

4393
03:30:41,690 --> 03:30:46,690
They are handmade bows and arrows.
He's long spear like arrows that it's 

4394
03:30:46,690 --> 03:30:50,750
not like a regular bone marrow that's 
like a five foot long arrow restraint.

4395
03:30:51,110 --> 03:30:55,640
They walk around barefoot and uh,
they have some Russian shotgun and their

4396
03:30:55,641 --> 03:30:58,490
favorite thing to do is they have a 
Russian shotgun.

4397
03:30:58,600 --> 03:31:03,600
The other got a Russian shotgun and 
somehow they got from somebody and it 

4398
03:31:03,600 --> 03:31:03,800
made it all the way deep into the 
jungle.

4399
03:31:03,810 --> 03:31:08,810
But the shelves are very precious.
But their favorite thing to do is shoot 

4400
03:31:08,810 --> 03:31:12,131
an eat monkeys.
It's like their number one favorite 

4401
03:31:12,131 --> 03:31:14,321
thing to eat and they cooked it on the 
show and it was really weird to watch.

4402
03:31:14,990 --> 03:31:19,310
You talk about some strange genetic 
connection that you have with a very,

4403
03:31:19,730 --> 03:31:24,730
very human shape,
like the lips and the eyes and the face 

4404
03:31:24,730 --> 03:31:28,271
of a,
you can recognize a certain amount of 

4405
03:31:28,271 --> 03:31:31,361
human in that little little fella when 
they are fellow female,

4406
03:31:31,430 --> 03:31:33,350
whatever female version of fellow would 
be.

4407
03:31:33,800 --> 03:31:34,740
But um,
so they,

4408
03:31:34,741 --> 03:31:38,810
they cooked it over this fire and then 
made this stew out of it.

4409
03:31:39,340 --> 03:31:41,510
Right?
Well,

4410
03:31:41,570 --> 03:31:43,400
actually to go back to our,
um,

4411
03:31:44,090 --> 03:31:49,090
cultured meat conversation,
one thing that's weird about that 

4412
03:31:49,090 --> 03:31:50,030
prospect is that if,
in fact,

4413
03:31:50,031 --> 03:31:53,070
so if you're making,
if you're growing cells in a vat,

4414
03:31:53,630 --> 03:31:56,570
then there's no problem with 
cannibalism,

4415
03:31:57,020 --> 03:32:02,020
right?
So that you could be growing human meat 

4416
03:32:02,020 --> 03:32:02,020
and fat,
right?

4417
03:32:02,020 --> 03:32:02,570
That's that.
I mean there's zero ethical problem,

4418
03:32:02,600 --> 03:32:07,040
but it's just as,
as rote task is as a,

4419
03:32:07,970 --> 03:32:12,970
at least to my palate,
has fairly grotesque thing to 

4420
03:32:12,970 --> 03:32:16,931
contemplate.
But these are just the distinction I'm 

4421
03:32:16,931 --> 03:32:16,931
just talking about.
I mean,

4422
03:32:16,931 --> 03:32:18,680
you know,
there is no in principle,

4423
03:32:18,681 --> 03:32:21,200
human DNA,
right?

4424
03:32:21,201 --> 03:32:23,150
And this and that.
And at the cellular level,

4425
03:32:23,750 --> 03:32:24,640
the,
the,

4426
03:32:24,760 --> 03:32:26,300
the,
the,

4427
03:32:27,090 --> 03:32:32,090
the difference between human muscle 
protein and bovine muscle protein is not

4428
03:32:33,831 --> 03:32:34,900
me.
That's if this,

4429
03:32:34,940 --> 03:32:38,600
if this was never attached to an animal,
it's a.

4430
03:32:39,350 --> 03:32:42,100
we're dealing with concepts here and 
it's like when you,

4431
03:32:42,280 --> 03:32:47,280
if you bite a fingernail and swallow it 
or you are practicing auto cannibalism,

4432
03:32:47,961 --> 03:32:48,900
right?
I mean it's,

4433
03:32:48,930 --> 03:32:49,490
it's a,

4434
03:32:54,050 --> 03:32:57,020
at some level it is a concept is doing a
lot of work.

4435
03:32:57,050 --> 03:33:01,010
It's uninsurable when you're talking 
about depriving another person of life.

4436
03:33:01,070 --> 03:33:03,480
But if you're talking about spinning up 
sells in a Vat,

4437
03:33:03,500 --> 03:33:04,850
then then it becomes,
well,

4438
03:33:05,300 --> 03:33:08,900
does it really matter whether this is.
This was a person,

4439
03:33:08,940 --> 03:33:13,940
you know,
maybe people would decide that would be 

4440
03:33:13,940 --> 03:33:13,940
the only ethical choice to hasten 
cultured human meat.

4441
03:33:13,940 --> 03:33:15,980
If you can eat meat,
you have to eat human meat.

4442
03:33:15,981 --> 03:33:20,981
There's the end of this economy.
You can't harm any other animals.

4443
03:33:21,081 --> 03:33:22,850
Not only can you,
you have to eat yourself.

4444
03:33:22,910 --> 03:33:26,870
This is what the cattle industry could 
do to just quash this.

4445
03:33:26,871 --> 03:33:31,871
That just spread the rumor that there 
are human cells and those vats and you 

4446
03:33:31,871 --> 03:33:35,260
go to your local center,
you get scraped and then they start 

4447
03:33:35,260 --> 03:33:37,710
making your monthly supply of you.
Soylent Green is people

4448
03:33:38,760 --> 03:33:42,870
and they just have it in a vat and they 
break you off a cube every week.

4449
03:33:43,750 --> 03:33:48,750
He'd take it back to you and you eat 
yourself and that's the only meat you 

4450
03:33:49,191 --> 03:33:54,191
were allowed to eat yourself while we 
figured out a way to live in harmony 

4451
03:33:54,191 --> 03:33:57,471
with nature.
We just have to kill everything except 

4452
03:33:57,471 --> 03:33:59,541
us and then eat ourselves.
Tell us which part of your own body you 

4453
03:33:59,541 --> 03:34:00,950
want to eat for the rest of your life 
and we will culture themselves.

4454
03:34:01,230 --> 03:34:02,460
Well,
I know it was you that I was having this

4455
03:34:02,461 --> 03:34:07,461
conversation with once,
I believe where we were talking about 

4456
03:34:07,461 --> 03:34:09,390
how when areas become more educated and 
women become more educated,

4457
03:34:09,391 --> 03:34:13,620
it tends to slow the population down 
like people tend to.

4458
03:34:13,630 --> 03:34:18,630
They tend to even worry that if these 
graphs continue further on that people 

4459
03:34:19,350 --> 03:34:24,350
in industrialized parts of the world as 
you know the they get into the first 

4460
03:34:24,350 --> 03:34:25,560
world.
If they do,

4461
03:34:25,890 --> 03:34:27,970
they'll more likely to have less and 
less people.

4462
03:34:28,010 --> 03:34:33,010
Paul has less and less children.
Fertility goes down with literacy and 

4463
03:34:33,010 --> 03:34:35,320
education with among women.
Yeah.

4464
03:34:35,870 --> 03:34:37,340
Um,
and there's know.

4465
03:34:37,460 --> 03:34:40,630
So just to kind of map that onto,
you know,

4466
03:34:40,631 --> 03:34:41,380
life is,
you know,

4467
03:34:41,381 --> 03:34:45,850
adheres is a women given all the choices
available,

4468
03:34:45,920 --> 03:34:50,920
know educational,
economic and an ability to plan a 

4469
03:34:52,391 --> 03:34:57,391
pregnancy.
So here we have women who want to have 

4470
03:34:57,391 --> 03:34:58,080
careers,
want to go to college and they,

4471
03:34:58,570 --> 03:35:03,570
they delay pregnancy to the point where 
they have realized a lot of those um,

4472
03:35:05,470 --> 03:35:08,720
aspirations and so pregnancies come 
later and later and later and,

4473
03:35:08,870 --> 03:35:13,870
and,
and families get smaller and smaller 

4474
03:35:13,870 --> 03:35:13,870
and,
and um,

4475
03:35:13,870 --> 03:35:13,870
and so,
you know,

4476
03:35:13,870 --> 03:35:17,200
virtually no one chooses to have 10 
kids,

4477
03:35:17,850 --> 03:35:22,850
um,
in the face of all of this other 

4478
03:35:22,850 --> 03:35:26,160
opportunity that were the things they 
also want that life,

4479
03:35:26,230 --> 03:35:27,080
right?
Even if,

4480
03:35:27,081 --> 03:35:28,150
if they,
if they can avoid it,

4481
03:35:28,330 --> 03:35:30,250
if you can't avoid it,
well then you just find yourself with 10

4482
03:35:30,251 --> 03:35:30,880
kids.
Right?

4483
03:35:31,540 --> 03:35:33,760
Or if you have some religious dogma 
which says,

4484
03:35:33,761 --> 03:35:38,761
you though it's possible to avoid.
You shouldn't avoid it because you were 

4485
03:35:38,761 --> 03:35:38,830
put here to have as many kids as 
possible,

4486
03:35:39,130 --> 03:35:44,130
but are you allowed to bring that up?
When you talk about the population 

4487
03:35:44,130 --> 03:35:44,410
crisis,
are you allowed to.

4488
03:35:44,470 --> 03:35:45,250
I mean,
that's a,

4489
03:35:45,251 --> 03:35:48,340
that's a fascinating piece of 
information.

4490
03:35:48,530 --> 03:35:48,940
Well,
what,

4491
03:35:49,170 --> 03:35:51,300
which population crisis are you thinking
of?

4492
03:35:51,310 --> 03:35:52,930
Because there,
there is a bunch of them.

4493
03:35:53,020 --> 03:35:55,080
They're two different ones.
They're two opposite ones,

4494
03:35:55,110 --> 03:35:58,310
which is China where they don't let you 
have girls will just,

4495
03:35:58,590 --> 03:35:59,870
you.
You don't want the,

4496
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:02,880
they live lesson that I think they've 
relaxed that a,

4497
03:36:03,150 --> 03:36:05,070
I think they've relaxed the one child 
policy,

4498
03:36:05,071 --> 03:36:07,830
but I'm not sure I remember hearing 
something about that.

4499
03:36:07,831 --> 03:36:09,690
And the other one you would say India.
Well,

4500
03:36:09,691 --> 03:36:09,990
no,
no,

4501
03:36:09,991 --> 03:36:12,780
I'm excited.
States know that there are the other,

4502
03:36:13,230 --> 03:36:18,230
there there's an overpopulation crisis 
in certain countries and in and 

4503
03:36:18,871 --> 03:36:23,871
disproportionately in the developing 
world and there is under population in 

4504
03:36:23,871 --> 03:36:24,450
the development world.
I mean they're there.

4505
03:36:24,690 --> 03:36:28,260
Most of western Europe is not replacing 
itself.

4506
03:36:28,380 --> 03:36:30,120
So you're having,
um,

4507
03:36:30,750 --> 03:36:33,570
these senescent populations,
uh,

4508
03:36:33,870 --> 03:36:37,060
who have to,
they just have to import the,

4509
03:36:37,080 --> 03:36:42,080
they rely on immigration for,
for just that to carry on the functions 

4510
03:36:42,971 --> 03:36:47,971
of society because they're just,
they're not at anywhere near replacement

4511
03:36:47,981 --> 03:36:52,981
rate is the most surprising detail that 
brings us home is that there are more 

4512
03:36:56,261 --> 03:37:01,261
adult diapers as Japan and more adult 
diapers sold in Japan than baby diapers.

4513
03:37:02,860 --> 03:37:05,560
Now just think about that for the 
implication of that for society,

4514
03:37:05,710 --> 03:37:10,710
right?
How do you have as a sign of how do you 

4515
03:37:10,710 --> 03:37:10,720
have a functioning society,
you know,

4516
03:37:10,721 --> 03:37:11,570
barring,
you know,

4517
03:37:11,571 --> 03:37:13,870
perfect robots that can tend to your 
needs,

4518
03:37:14,310 --> 03:37:17,080
um,
where you have just,

4519
03:37:18,030 --> 03:37:18,350
um,

4520
03:37:19,880 --> 03:37:24,880
disproportionate number of people who 
are no longer economically productive 

4521
03:37:24,880 --> 03:37:28,580
relying on the Labor of the young to,
you know,

4522
03:37:28,780 --> 03:37:31,350
keep them alive and cure their diseases 
and,

4523
03:37:31,370 --> 03:37:33,800
and um,
uh,

4524
03:37:33,880 --> 03:37:36,700
defend them from crime and all that.
But the,

4525
03:37:37,330 --> 03:37:39,700
the ratio is totally out of whack,
right?

4526
03:37:40,420 --> 03:37:43,570
So you need,
we need people like the world is a giant

4527
03:37:43,571 --> 03:37:48,571
Ponzi scheme on some level you keep,
you need new people to come in to 

4528
03:37:48,571 --> 03:37:50,140
maintain it for the old people.
Barring,

4529
03:37:50,170 --> 03:37:55,170
you know,
apart from having some technology that 

4530
03:37:55,170 --> 03:37:55,510
allows you to do that without people.
Um,

4531
03:37:56,500 --> 03:38:01,500
but I think our,
everything I've heard about population 

4532
03:38:01,500 --> 03:38:02,820
recently,
it suggests that we are on course,

4533
03:38:02,890 --> 03:38:07,890
you know,
globally to peak around nine and a half 

4534
03:38:07,890 --> 03:38:08,680
billion and then taper off.
I don't,

4535
03:38:08,681 --> 03:38:13,681
I don't think anyone now is forecasting 
this totally unsustainable growth where 

4536
03:38:14,021 --> 03:38:17,920
we're going to wind up with the St Louis
and I nine and a half billion people you

4537
03:38:17,930 --> 03:38:19,410
said billing,
um,

4538
03:38:19,810 --> 03:38:22,540
where we're going to hit something like 
20 billion people,

4539
03:38:22,780 --> 03:38:23,080
right?

4540
03:38:23,980 --> 03:38:27,880
I don't think anyone,
even the most mouth,

4541
03:38:27,910 --> 03:38:32,910
Uzi and people are expressing that 
concern at the moment,

4542
03:38:33,370 --> 03:38:38,370
which,
which was the case like 20 or 30 years 

4543
03:38:38,370 --> 03:38:40,651
ago where they thought this is just 
going to keep going and we're going to 

4544
03:38:40,651 --> 03:38:44,101
hit the carrying capacity of the earth,
which is something like 40 billion 

4545
03:38:44,101 --> 03:38:44,101
people.
Um,

4546
03:38:44,680 --> 03:38:45,700
wow.
Uh,

4547
03:38:45,701 --> 03:38:47,690
I don't think anyone thinks w w because 
we're just.

4548
03:38:47,710 --> 03:38:52,710
Fertility is falling everywhere but it.
But it has fallen actually below 

4549
03:38:53,050 --> 03:38:58,050
replacement in the developed world.
Do you think in our lifetimes in or in 

4550
03:38:58,931 --> 03:39:03,931
our children's lifetime,
it's feasible that we figure out a way 

4551
03:39:04,900 --> 03:39:09,900
in some way to,
I'm not endorsing like taking people's 

4552
03:39:09,900 --> 03:39:13,771
money and giving it to other people,
but in some sort of a way to eliminate 

4553
03:39:13,771 --> 03:39:14,230
poverty.
Is that even possible?

4554
03:39:14,320 --> 03:39:19,320
Is it ever going to be possible to 
completely eliminate poverty worldwide 

4555
03:39:19,320 --> 03:39:20,260
and within like a lifetime?

4556
03:39:20,980 --> 03:39:25,980
Well,
I think we talked about this the last 

4557
03:39:25,980 --> 03:39:28,531
time when we spoke about ai,
but I mean this is the implication of 

4558
03:39:28,531 --> 03:39:29,510
much of what we talked about here.
If you,

4559
03:39:29,511 --> 03:39:34,511
if you imagine building the perfect 
labor saving technology,

4560
03:39:35,030 --> 03:39:36,440
right?
What do you imagine?

4561
03:39:36,470 --> 03:39:41,470
Just having a machine that can build any
machine that can do any human labor,

4562
03:39:43,450 --> 03:39:46,460
you power by sunlight more or less for 
the cost of raw materials.

4563
03:39:46,461 --> 03:39:46,990
Right?
So you're,

4564
03:39:47,060 --> 03:39:51,740
you're talking about the ultimate wealth
generation device and now we're not just

4565
03:39:51,741 --> 03:39:56,741
talking about blue collar labor,
we're talking about the kind of labor 

4566
03:39:56,741 --> 03:39:56,741
you and I do,
right?

4567
03:39:56,741 --> 03:40:00,810
So like the artistic labor and 
scientific labor and um,

4568
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:06,120
you know,
just a machine that comes up with good 

4569
03:40:06,120 --> 03:40:06,120
ideas.
Right?

4570
03:40:06,120 --> 03:40:06,710
And here's what we're talking about,
general artificial intelligence,

4571
03:40:07,280 --> 03:40:09,380
um,
this,

4572
03:40:09,410 --> 03:40:12,230
if in the right political and economic 
system,

4573
03:40:12,800 --> 03:40:17,540
this would just cancel any need for 
people to have to work to survive,

4574
03:40:18,020 --> 03:40:18,260
right?

4575
03:40:18,290 --> 03:40:23,290
It just would be,
there'd be enough of everything to go 

4576
03:40:23,290 --> 03:40:23,330
around.
And then the question would be,

4577
03:40:23,840 --> 03:40:26,750
do we have the right political and 
economic system where we,

4578
03:40:26,780 --> 03:40:30,380
where we actually could spread that 
wealth or would we just,

4579
03:40:30,690 --> 03:40:34,700
we just find ourselves in some kind of 
horrendous arms race and,

4580
03:40:34,730 --> 03:40:35,710
and,
uh,

4581
03:40:35,950 --> 03:40:36,820
uh,
situation of,

4582
03:40:36,950 --> 03:40:41,510
of wealth inequality,
unlike any we've ever seen.

4583
03:40:41,570 --> 03:40:43,760
Um,
it's a,

4584
03:40:43,761 --> 03:40:44,590
um,
we don't,

4585
03:40:44,591 --> 03:40:46,940
we don't have the,
it's not in place now.

4586
03:40:46,941 --> 03:40:49,190
And if someone just handed us this 
device,

4587
03:40:49,670 --> 03:40:50,030
you know,
if,

4588
03:40:50,060 --> 03:40:51,730
if,
um,

4589
03:40:52,840 --> 03:40:53,720
and it were,
you know,

4590
03:40:53,850 --> 03:40:56,360
all of my concerns about ai or gone,
I mean,

4591
03:40:56,361 --> 03:41:01,361
there's no question about this thing I'm
doing things we didn't want it would do 

4592
03:41:01,361 --> 03:41:03,260
exactly what we want when we want it.
And there's no,

4593
03:41:03,261 --> 03:41:07,310
there's just no danger of it.
That's interest becoming misaligned with

4594
03:41:07,311 --> 03:41:12,311
our own.
It's just like a perfect oracle and a 

4595
03:41:12,311 --> 03:41:12,311
perfect designer of new technology.

4596
03:41:12,311 --> 03:41:15,230
Um,
if it was handed to us now,

4597
03:41:16,640 --> 03:41:20,720
I would expect just complete chaos,
right?

4598
03:41:20,721 --> 03:41:21,410
I would explain if,
if,

4599
03:41:21,470 --> 03:41:26,470
if facebook built this thing tomorrow 
and announced it or rumor spread that 

4600
03:41:26,841 --> 03:41:27,770
they had built it,
right?

4601
03:41:28,490 --> 03:41:30,770
What are the implications for Russia and
China?

4602
03:41:30,920 --> 03:41:35,920
Well,
in so far as they are as adversarial as 

4603
03:41:35,920 --> 03:41:40,301
they are now,
it would be rational for them to just 

4604
03:41:40,301 --> 03:41:40,301
nuke California,
right?

4605
03:41:40,301 --> 03:41:43,050
Because it,
because the happiness device is,

4606
03:41:43,051 --> 03:41:45,170
there's a winner take all scenario.
I mean,

4607
03:41:45,171 --> 03:41:45,590
you,
you,

4608
03:41:45,591 --> 03:41:47,780
when the world,
if you have this device,

4609
03:41:47,781 --> 03:41:49,540
you can turn the lights off in China,
you know,

4610
03:41:49,640 --> 03:41:54,640
the moment you have this device,
you can just imagine it's just the 

4611
03:41:54,640 --> 03:41:57,011
ultimate because literally we're talking
about and you know,

4612
03:41:57,441 --> 03:41:59,960
many people are may doubt whether such a
thing as possible.

4613
03:41:59,961 --> 03:42:04,961
But again,
we're just talking about the 

4614
03:42:04,961 --> 03:42:08,501
implications of intelligence that can 
make refinements to itself in over time 

4615
03:42:11,241 --> 03:42:11,750
course.

4616
03:42:11,810 --> 03:42:16,810
That is,
it bears no relationship to what we 

4617
03:42:16,810 --> 03:42:17,270
experienced as apes.
Right?

4618
03:42:17,271 --> 03:42:21,170
So you're talking about a system that 
can make changes to his own source code,

4619
03:42:21,730 --> 03:42:24,860
um,
and become better and better at learning

4620
03:42:24,861 --> 03:42:27,380
and more and more knowledgeable.
Has Instantaneous,

4621
03:42:27,381 --> 03:42:32,381
if we give it access to the Internet,
it has instantaneous to all human and 

4622
03:42:32,381 --> 03:42:36,150
machine knowledge and uh,
it does,

4623
03:42:36,300 --> 03:42:39,360
you know,
thousands of years of work every,

4624
03:42:39,750 --> 03:42:42,740
every day of our lives,
right?

4625
03:42:42,750 --> 03:42:46,230
They thousands of years of equivalent 
human level intellectual work.

4626
03:42:48,060 --> 03:42:51,610
It's just a,
it's on our intuitions completely falter

4627
03:42:51,640 --> 03:42:51,960
to,
to,

4628
03:42:51,980 --> 03:42:55,260
to capture just how immensely powerful 
such a thing would be.

4629
03:42:55,261 --> 03:42:58,350
And there's no reason to think this 
isn't possible.

4630
03:42:58,650 --> 03:42:58,890
I mean,
the,

4631
03:42:59,060 --> 03:43:04,060
the,
the most skeptical thing you can 

4632
03:43:04,060 --> 03:43:04,470
honestly say about this is that this 
isn't coming soon,

4633
03:43:04,860 --> 03:43:05,520
right?
It's like,

4634
03:43:05,521 --> 03:43:08,130
this is not to say that this is not 
possible.

4635
03:43:08,820 --> 03:43:10,500
Makes no scientific sense at this point.

4636
03:43:10,860 --> 03:43:15,860
There's no reason to think that a 
sufficiently advanced digital computer 

4637
03:43:16,590 --> 03:43:21,590
can't,
can't instantiate general intelligence 

4638
03:43:21,590 --> 03:43:23,100
of the sort that we have.
There's no reason to think that.

4639
03:43:23,190 --> 03:43:28,190
I mean,
the intelligence has to be at bottom 

4640
03:43:28,190 --> 03:43:30,860
some form of information processing and 
if we get the algorithm right with 

4641
03:43:30,860 --> 03:43:35,121
enough hardware resources and the,
and the limit is definitely not the 

4642
03:43:35,341 --> 03:43:36,360
hardware at this point.
It's,

4643
03:43:36,361 --> 03:43:38,340
it's the,
the algorithms.

4644
03:43:38,820 --> 03:43:43,820
Um,
there's just no reason to think this 

4645
03:43:43,820 --> 03:43:47,180
can't take off and,
and scale and that we would be in the 

4646
03:43:47,180 --> 03:43:48,120
presence of something that is,
that is,

4647
03:43:48,121 --> 03:43:50,820
uh,
like having an,

4648
03:43:50,930 --> 03:43:55,930
an alternate human civilization in a box
that is making thousands of years of 

4649
03:43:56,431 --> 03:43:58,080
progress every day.
Right?

4650
03:43:58,081 --> 03:44:00,120
So just imagine that if you had in a 
box,

4651
03:44:00,710 --> 03:44:03,000
you know,
the 10 smartest people who've ever lived

4652
03:44:03,630 --> 03:44:05,880
and you know,
every time,

4653
03:44:05,881 --> 03:44:08,310
every week they make 20,000
years of progress,

4654
03:44:08,430 --> 03:44:08,670
right?

4655
03:44:08,670 --> 03:44:10,980
Because,
because that is the actual,

4656
03:44:11,110 --> 03:44:16,110
the,
you were talking about electronic 

4657
03:44:16,110 --> 03:44:16,110
circuits being a million times faster 
than,

4658
03:44:16,110 --> 03:44:18,480
than biological circuits.
So even if it was just,

4659
03:44:18,630 --> 03:44:21,270
and I believe I said this the last time 
we talked about ai,

4660
03:44:21,271 --> 03:44:21,880
but this is,
you know,

4661
03:44:21,950 --> 03:44:26,130
this is what brings it home for me,
even if it's just a matter of faster,

4662
03:44:26,250 --> 03:44:26,970
right?
It's not,

4663
03:44:26,971 --> 03:44:31,230
it's not anything especially spooky.
Just this can do human level,

4664
03:44:31,231 --> 03:44:34,410
intellectual work,
but just a million times faster.

4665
03:44:34,950 --> 03:44:39,950
And again,
this totally under sells the prospects 

4666
03:44:39,950 --> 03:44:44,300
of superintelligence.
I think human level intellectual work 

4667
03:44:44,300 --> 03:44:44,300
is,
is,

4668
03:44:44,300 --> 03:44:45,290
um,
uh,

4669
03:44:45,420 --> 03:44:47,700
it's gonna seem pretty paltry in the 
end,

4670
03:44:47,701 --> 03:44:49,710
but if you just imagined just speeding 
it up.

4671
03:44:49,770 --> 03:44:51,900
If you imagine if we were doing this 
podcast,

4672
03:44:52,410 --> 03:44:57,150
imagine how smart I would seem if 
between every sentence.

4673
03:44:57,690 --> 03:45:02,250
I actually had a year to figure out what
I was going to say next.

4674
03:45:02,250 --> 03:45:07,250
Right?
And so I say this one sentence and you 

4675
03:45:07,250 --> 03:45:08,811
say,
you asked me a question and then in my 

4676
03:45:08,811 --> 03:45:10,791
world I just have a year.
I'm going to go spend the next year 

4677
03:45:10,791 --> 03:45:10,791
getting,
getting ready for,

4678
03:45:10,791 --> 03:45:12,630
for Joe,
and it's going to be perfect.

4679
03:45:13,110 --> 03:45:16,060
And this is just compounding upon 
itself.

4680
03:45:16,061 --> 03:45:18,210
Like not only can I not,
not only,

4681
03:45:18,390 --> 03:45:19,470
uh,
I,

4682
03:45:19,471 --> 03:45:21,300
um,
am I working faster?

4683
03:45:21,810 --> 03:45:25,710
Ultimately I can change my,
my ability to work faster.

4684
03:45:25,711 --> 03:45:30,711
I mean,
we're talking about software that can 

4685
03:45:30,711 --> 03:45:30,711
change itself.
You're talking about something that,

4686
03:45:30,711 --> 03:45:33,800
that becomes self improving.
So there's a compounding and function 

4687
03:45:33,800 --> 03:45:33,800
there.
But,

4688
03:45:33,800 --> 03:45:37,230
um,
it's the point is,

4689
03:45:37,231 --> 03:45:38,930
is unimaginable,
uh,

4690
03:45:38,980 --> 03:45:41,360
in terms of how,
uh,

4691
03:45:42,700 --> 03:45:47,700
how much change this could affect.
And if you imagine the best case 

4692
03:45:47,700 --> 03:45:49,450
scenario where this is under our 
control,

4693
03:45:49,480 --> 03:45:51,100
right,
where there's no alignment problem,

4694
03:45:51,101 --> 03:45:51,820
where it's just,
it doesn't,

4695
03:45:51,821 --> 03:45:53,650
this thing doesn't do anything that 
surprises us,

4696
03:45:54,010 --> 03:45:56,380
this thing will always take direction 
from us.

4697
03:45:56,860 --> 03:46:01,860
It will never,
it will never develop interests of its 

4698
03:46:01,860 --> 03:46:01,860
own.
Right?

4699
03:46:01,860 --> 03:46:02,080
Which is again,
the fear.

4700
03:46:02,081 --> 03:46:04,210
But let's,
let's just say this is totally obedient.

4701
03:46:04,211 --> 03:46:07,660
It's just an oracle and a genie route 
in,

4702
03:46:07,830 --> 03:46:10,060
in one.
And um,

4703
03:46:10,540 --> 03:46:11,200
you know,
we say,

4704
03:46:11,201 --> 03:46:16,201
you know,
cure Alzheimer's and it cures 

4705
03:46:16,201 --> 03:46:16,201
Alzheimer's,
you know,

4706
03:46:16,201 --> 03:46:16,300
you solve the protein folding problem 
and,

4707
03:46:16,301 --> 03:46:19,210
and it just is.
It's just often running and to develop a

4708
03:46:19,211 --> 03:46:23,020
perfect nanotechnology and it does that.
This is all,

4709
03:46:23,021 --> 03:46:24,670
again,
going back to David Deutsch,

4710
03:46:25,240 --> 03:46:30,240
there's no reason to think this isn't 
possible because anything that's 

4711
03:46:30,240 --> 03:46:34,471
compatible with the laws of physics can 
be done given the requisite knowledge,

4712
03:46:34,870 --> 03:46:39,870
right?
So you just get enough intelligence as 

4713
03:46:39,870 --> 03:46:40,630
long as you're not violating the laws of
physics,

4714
03:46:40,660 --> 03:46:43,750
you can do something in that space.
Um,

4715
03:46:44,710 --> 03:46:46,570
so,
but the problem is this is a winner take

4716
03:46:46,571 --> 03:46:48,760
all scenario.
So facebook does it tomorrow,

4717
03:46:49,270 --> 03:46:51,970
and China and Russia find out about it.

4718
03:46:52,600 --> 03:46:57,600
They can't afford to wait around to see 
whether the US decides to do something 

4719
03:46:57,600 --> 03:46:59,980
not entirely selfish with this,
right?

4720
03:46:59,981 --> 03:47:04,981
Because they're their worst fears could 
be realized if Donald Trump is 

4721
03:47:04,981 --> 03:47:09,961
president,
was Donald Trump going to do with a 

4722
03:47:09,961 --> 03:47:11,080
perfect ai when he has already told the 
world that he hates Islam?

4723
03:47:11,081 --> 03:47:12,140
Right?
Um,

4724
03:47:12,790 --> 03:47:15,130
it's a,
it's a,

4725
03:47:15,131 --> 03:47:20,131
um,
we would have to have a political and 

4726
03:47:20,131 --> 03:47:23,140
economic system that allowed us to 
absorb this ultimate wealth,

4727
03:47:23,141 --> 03:47:25,210
save it will wealth producing 
technology.

4728
03:47:25,270 --> 03:47:26,510
Um,
and,

4729
03:47:27,060 --> 03:47:32,060
and again,
so this may sound like pure Saifai 

4730
03:47:32,060 --> 03:47:34,830
craziness to people.
I don't think there is any reason to 

4731
03:47:34,830 --> 03:47:38,581
believe that it is,
but walk way back from that edge of 

4732
03:47:38,581 --> 03:47:40,840
craziness and just look at dumb ai,
you know,

4733
03:47:40,841 --> 03:47:44,260
narrow ai,
just self driving cars and automation.

4734
03:47:44,261 --> 03:47:49,261
And I'm an intelligent algorithms that 
can do human level work,

4735
03:47:51,440 --> 03:47:56,440
uh,
that is already poised to change our 

4736
03:47:56,440 --> 03:47:58,990
world massively and create massive 
wealth inequality,

4737
03:47:58,991 --> 03:47:59,420
which we have.

4738
03:47:59,460 --> 03:48:01,540
We have to figure out how to spread this
wealth.

4739
03:48:02,080 --> 03:48:06,430
What do you do when you can automate a 
50 percent of,

4740
03:48:06,670 --> 03:48:11,670
of human labor?
Were you paying attention to the 

4741
03:48:11,670 --> 03:48:13,420
artificial intelligence go match?
Yeah.

4742
03:48:14,880 --> 03:48:19,880
I don't actually play go,
so I wasn't paying that kind of 

4743
03:48:19,880 --> 03:48:19,930
attention to it,
but I'm aware of what happened there.

4744
03:48:19,931 --> 03:48:21,040
And you know,
the rules of go.

4745
03:48:21,970 --> 03:48:24,040
I'm not,
not so that I know.

4746
03:48:24,041 --> 03:48:25,120
Actually I don't,
I don't,

4747
03:48:25,121 --> 03:48:25,840
I don't play,
I don't know.

4748
03:48:25,850 --> 03:48:28,640
I don't know if I know vaguely how you,
how you,

4749
03:48:28,641 --> 03:48:30,740
um,
how it looks when a game is played,

4750
03:48:30,741 --> 03:48:32,690
but I don't supposed to be very 
complicated.

4751
03:48:32,691 --> 03:48:37,691
The more complicated and more 
possibilities than chess and that's why 

4752
03:48:37,691 --> 03:48:42,671
it took 20 years longer for a computer 
to be the best player in the world.

4753
03:48:43,690 --> 03:48:44,600
Um,
it's,

4754
03:48:44,690 --> 03:48:45,920
it is.
Um,

4755
03:48:47,030 --> 03:48:48,620
did you see how the computer did it too?

4756
03:48:49,810 --> 03:48:50,300
Well,
I didn't,

4757
03:48:50,301 --> 03:48:51,620
I,
I know,

4758
03:48:51,700 --> 03:48:56,700
I mean this is the company that did it 
is deep mind which was acquired by 

4759
03:48:56,781 --> 03:49:01,781
Google and they're at the cutting edge 
of ai research and yeah.

4760
03:49:01,821 --> 03:49:02,330
Well,
it's,

4761
03:49:03,500 --> 03:49:07,760
the cartoons are unfortunately not so 
far from what is possible,

4762
03:49:07,761 --> 03:49:11,060
but um,
the,

4763
03:49:11,061 --> 03:49:11,960
uh,
yeah,

4764
03:49:11,961 --> 03:49:14,210
I mean there's,
again,

4765
03:49:14,211 --> 03:49:16,970
this is not,
this is not general intelligence.

4766
03:49:17,290 --> 03:49:22,290
We're talking like these are not 
machines that can even play tic Tac toe 

4767
03:49:22,290 --> 03:49:22,290
right now.
There's some,

4768
03:49:22,290 --> 03:49:26,600
there,
there have been some moves away from 

4769
03:49:26,600 --> 03:49:29,141
this or like deep mind has trained an 
algorithm to play all of the Atari Games

4770
03:49:30,471 --> 03:49:30,860
like,
uh,

4771
03:49:30,920 --> 03:49:35,920
from 1980 or whenever and it is very 
quickly became superhuman on most of 

4772
03:49:37,131 --> 03:49:38,820
them I think.
I don't think it's superhuman human,

4773
03:49:38,870 --> 03:49:43,870
all of them yet.
But it could play in a space invaders 

4774
03:49:43,870 --> 03:49:44,330
and all these and break out all these 
games that are,

4775
03:49:44,420 --> 03:49:45,020
are,
um,

4776
03:49:45,880 --> 03:49:47,380
uh,
uh,

4777
03:49:48,800 --> 03:49:53,800
to highly unlike one another and it's 
the same algorithm becoming expert and 

4778
03:49:54,621 --> 03:49:55,850
superhuman in all of them.

4779
03:49:55,850 --> 03:50:00,850
And that's,
that's a new paradigm and it's using a 

4780
03:50:00,850 --> 03:50:01,700
technique called deep learning for that.
Um,

4781
03:50:02,510 --> 03:50:05,240
and that's,
and that's been very exciting and I will

4782
03:50:05,241 --> 03:50:07,130
be incredibly useful.
You know,

4783
03:50:07,160 --> 03:50:09,020
this is in the other,
the flip side of all this.

4784
03:50:09,021 --> 03:50:11,840
I know that everything I tend to say on 
this sound scary,

4785
03:50:11,841 --> 03:50:14,010
but this is all like,
I mean,

4786
03:50:14,200 --> 03:50:17,900
the next scariest thing is not to do any
of this stuff.

4787
03:50:17,901 --> 03:50:19,640
It's like we,
we want intelligence,

4788
03:50:19,641 --> 03:50:24,641
we want automation,
we want to figure out how to solve 

4789
03:50:24,641 --> 03:50:28,211
problems that we can't get solved.
So like intelligence is the best thing 

4790
03:50:28,211 --> 03:50:28,211
we've got.
So we want more of it.

4791
03:50:28,211 --> 03:50:29,960
Uh,
but we have to have a system where,

4792
03:50:30,350 --> 03:50:35,350
I mean,
it's scary that we have a system where 

4793
03:50:35,350 --> 03:50:37,391
if you gave the best possible version of
it to one research lab or to one 

4794
03:50:38,241 --> 03:50:43,241
government,
it's not obvious that that wouldn't 

4795
03:50:43,241 --> 03:50:44,690
destroy humanity,
right.

4796
03:50:44,720 --> 03:50:48,200
That wouldn't lead to massive 
dislocations where you'd have,

4797
03:50:48,201 --> 03:50:53,201
you know,
some trillionaire who's trumpeting his 

4798
03:50:53,201 --> 03:50:53,201
new device and,
and just,

4799
03:50:53,201 --> 03:50:54,640
you know,
50 percent unemployment in the US,

4800
03:50:54,680 --> 03:50:56,360
you know,
in a month.

4801
03:50:56,361 --> 03:50:56,950
Right.
I mean like he,

4802
03:50:56,980 --> 03:51:01,980
like,
it's not obvious how we would absorb 

4803
03:51:01,980 --> 03:51:01,980
this level of,
of progress.

4804
03:51:02,390 --> 03:51:03,310
Um,
and we,

4805
03:51:03,311 --> 03:51:04,610
we,
we definitely have to,

4806
03:51:05,030 --> 03:51:10,030
to figure out how to do it.
And now of course we can't assume the 

4807
03:51:10,030 --> 03:51:10,030
best case scenario.
Right?

4808
03:51:10,030 --> 03:51:13,130
That's the best case scenario.
I think there's a few people that put it

4809
03:51:13,131 --> 03:51:18,131
the way you put it,
that terrify the shit out of people and 

4810
03:51:18,131 --> 03:51:22,750
everyone else seems to have this rosy 
vision of increased longevity and 

4811
03:51:22,750 --> 03:51:25,040
automated everything and everything

4812
03:51:26,040 --> 03:51:30,210
and easy to get to work and medical 
procedures would be easier.

4813
03:51:30,211 --> 03:51:35,211
They're going to know how to do it,
but everybody looks at it like we are 

4814
03:51:35,211 --> 03:51:35,820
always going to be here,
but are we obsolete?

4815
03:51:35,970 --> 03:51:40,970
I mean,
is this idea of a living thing that's 

4816
03:51:40,970 --> 03:51:44,451
creative and wrapped up in emotions and 
lust and desires and jealousy and all 

4817
03:51:44,451 --> 03:51:47,130
the pettiness that we celebrated all the
time.

4818
03:51:47,131 --> 03:51:49,470
We still see it.
It's not getting any better.

4819
03:51:49,560 --> 03:51:50,420
Right?
If,

4820
03:51:50,520 --> 03:51:52,830
if we obsolete,
I mean,

4821
03:51:52,890 --> 03:51:54,930
what if this thing comes along and says,
listen,

4822
03:51:54,990 --> 03:51:59,990
there's a way to do.
You're going to abandon all that stupid 

4823
03:51:59,990 --> 03:52:02,241
shit.
He can abandon all that makes you all 

4824
03:52:02,241 --> 03:52:02,241
the stuff that makes you fun to be 
around.

4825
03:52:02,241 --> 03:52:02,970
Yeah,
and also fucks with.

4826
03:52:02,971 --> 03:52:05,460
You can live three times as long without
that stuff.

4827
03:52:05,990 --> 03:52:07,380
Oh,
I think it.

4828
03:52:08,770 --> 03:52:12,800
It would in the best case,
would usher in a,

4829
03:52:13,210 --> 03:52:17,450
a.
The possibility of,

4830
03:52:17,460 --> 03:52:22,460
of kind of fundamentally creative life 
where on the order of something like the

4831
03:52:23,481 --> 03:52:28,481
Matrix,
whether it's in the matrix or it's just 

4832
03:52:28,481 --> 03:52:30,671
in the world that has been made as 
beautiful as,

4833
03:52:31,790 --> 03:52:34,050
as possible.
Um,

4834
03:52:34,490 --> 03:52:35,390
based on

4835
03:52:37,020 --> 03:52:40,500
what would functionally be an unlimited 
resource of intelligence.

4836
03:52:40,650 --> 03:52:44,990
Let me just say,
it's just like for there to be a,

4837
03:52:45,030 --> 03:52:50,030
a,
an ability to solve problems of a sort 

4838
03:52:50,030 --> 03:52:52,050
that we can't currently imagine.
I mean,

4839
03:52:52,051 --> 03:52:57,051
it's just,
it really is like a place on the map 

4840
03:52:57,051 --> 03:52:57,051
that you can't,
you can't,

4841
03:52:57,051 --> 03:52:57,690
you can indicate it's over there.
You know,

4842
03:52:57,691 --> 03:53:01,050
it's like the blank spot on the map.
Ms Dot why it's called the singularity,

4843
03:53:01,051 --> 03:53:01,540
right?
It's like,

4844
03:53:01,550 --> 03:53:02,880
this is it.
This is a,

4845
03:53:03,530 --> 03:53:03,960
uh,
it was,

4846
03:53:03,961 --> 03:53:05,190
it was John von Neumann,
the.

4847
03:53:05,191 --> 03:53:10,140
I'm the inventor of Game Theory who a 
mathematician who,

4848
03:53:10,750 --> 03:53:15,120
um,
want along with Alan Turing and a couple

4849
03:53:15,121 --> 03:53:18,180
of other peoples who's really 
responsible for the computer revolution.

4850
03:53:18,540 --> 03:53:22,980
He was the first person to use this term
singularity to describe just this,

4851
03:53:22,981 --> 03:53:26,400
that,
that there's a speeding up of,

4852
03:53:26,910 --> 03:53:31,910
um,
information processing technology and a 

4853
03:53:33,250 --> 03:53:35,450
cultural reliance upon it,
uh,

4854
03:53:35,520 --> 03:53:40,520
beyond which we can't actually foresee 
the level of change that can come over 

4855
03:53:40,520 --> 03:53:40,870
our society.

4856
03:53:40,870 --> 03:53:41,350
It's like,
you know,

4857
03:53:41,351 --> 03:53:44,130
an event horizon past which we can't 
see.

4858
03:53:44,580 --> 03:53:46,950
Um,
and uh,

4859
03:53:47,210 --> 03:53:52,210
this certainly becomes true when you 
talk about these intelligent systems 

4860
03:53:52,210 --> 03:53:53,880
being able to make changes to 
themselves.

4861
03:53:54,210 --> 03:53:56,550
And again,
we're talking mostly software.

4862
03:53:56,551 --> 03:53:57,870
It's not,
I'm not imagining,

4863
03:53:59,360 --> 03:54:04,360
I mean the most important breakthroughs 
are almost certainly at the level of 

4864
03:54:04,360 --> 03:54:04,440
have better software.
I mean,

4865
03:54:04,540 --> 03:54:09,090
is we have,
in terms of the computing power that the

4866
03:54:09,330 --> 03:54:11,940
physical hardware on earth,
it's not,

4867
03:54:11,941 --> 03:54:14,460
that's not what's limiting our ai at the
moment.

4868
03:54:14,461 --> 03:54:17,270
It's not like we need more more,
um,

4869
03:54:18,000 --> 03:54:19,520
hardware,
um,

4870
03:54:19,740 --> 03:54:24,740
but we will get more hardware to up to 
the limits of physics and it gets 

4871
03:54:24,740 --> 03:54:26,230
smaller and smaller as it has a.
and,

4872
03:54:26,231 --> 03:54:30,610
you know,
if quantum computing becomes possible or

4873
03:54:30,611 --> 03:54:32,210
practical,
um,

4874
03:54:32,290 --> 03:54:33,660
that will,
uh,

4875
03:54:34,000 --> 03:54:36,130
and actually David Deutsch is,
is,

4876
03:54:36,131 --> 03:54:41,131
um,
the physicist I mentioned is one of the 

4877
03:54:41,131 --> 03:54:43,171
fathers of the concept of quantum 
computing that will open up a whole 

4878
03:54:44,531 --> 03:54:49,150
nother area,
a extreme of computing power.

4879
03:54:49,600 --> 03:54:54,600
That is,
I'm not at all analogous to the kinds 

4880
03:54:54,600 --> 03:54:54,600
of,
of uh,

4881
03:54:54,600 --> 03:54:55,870
machines we have now.
But,

4882
03:54:56,650 --> 03:54:59,260
um,
it's just,

4883
03:55:00,160 --> 03:55:05,160
when you imagine people don't,
people seem to always want to have it.

4884
03:55:06,360 --> 03:55:09,490
I just had this conversation with,
with Neil degrasse Tyson on my podcast.

4885
03:55:09,940 --> 03:55:14,230
He named Robert.
It was just keeping people.

4886
03:55:14,231 --> 03:55:19,231
I'm just,
I'm just attributing these ideas to 

4887
03:55:19,231 --> 03:55:19,231
handle a.
he's not a,

4888
03:55:19,231 --> 03:55:20,430
he doesn't take this line at all.
He's not at all.

4889
03:55:20,480 --> 03:55:21,730
He thinks it's all bullshit,
right?

4890
03:55:21,910 --> 03:55:25,810
He's not at all worried about Ai.
What does he think he thinks that,

4891
03:55:25,960 --> 03:55:26,680
you know,
we just,

4892
03:55:26,830 --> 03:55:31,390
we just use.
He's drawing an analogy from how we,

4893
03:55:31,750 --> 03:55:34,420
you currently use computers,
that they just,

4894
03:55:34,450 --> 03:55:37,300
they just keep helping us do what we 
want to do.

4895
03:55:37,301 --> 03:55:42,301
Like we decide what we want to do with 
computers and we just add them to our 

4896
03:55:42,301 --> 03:55:46,081
process.
And that process becomes automated and 

4897
03:55:46,081 --> 03:55:48,040
then we'll find new job somewhere else,
like you didn't need a stenographer once

4898
03:55:48,041 --> 03:55:49,870
you have voice recognition technology.

4899
03:55:49,870 --> 03:55:52,780
And I'm a.
that's not a problem,

4900
03:55:52,781 --> 03:55:54,370
a stenographer,
I'll find something else to do.

4901
03:55:54,371 --> 03:55:59,371
And so the economic dislocation isn't 
that bad and computers will just get 

4902
03:56:00,221 --> 03:56:02,380
better than they are.
And you know,

4903
03:56:02,381 --> 03:56:04,570
eventually Siri will actually work,
you know,

4904
03:56:04,571 --> 03:56:09,571
and you'll,
she'll answer your questions well and 

4905
03:56:09,571 --> 03:56:12,121
you're not,
it's not going to be a laugh line what 

4906
03:56:12,121 --> 03:56:12,121
series said to you today.
And um,

4907
03:56:12,640 --> 03:56:17,640
then all of this,
we'll just proceed to make life better 

4908
03:56:17,640 --> 03:56:22,440
right now.
None of that is imagining what it will 

4909
03:56:22,440 --> 03:56:27,001
be like to make because it will be a 
certain point where you'll have systems 

4910
03:56:27,001 --> 03:56:28,450
that are,
you know,

4911
03:56:28,540 --> 03:56:33,540
it's like the Cha,
the best chess player on earth is now 

4912
03:56:33,540 --> 03:56:35,010
always going to be a computer right 
there.

4913
03:56:35,440 --> 03:56:40,440
There's no,
there's not going to be a human born 

4914
03:56:40,440 --> 03:56:40,440
tomorrow that's going to be better than 
the best computer.

4915
03:56:40,440 --> 03:56:40,740
I mean,
it's like,

4916
03:56:40,750 --> 03:56:42,160
it's already like it's.

4917
03:56:42,760 --> 03:56:44,980
We have super human chess players on 
earth.

4918
03:56:45,370 --> 03:56:50,370
Now imagine having computers that are 
superhuman at every,

4919
03:56:51,010 --> 03:56:54,040
every task that is relevant,
every intellectual task,

4920
03:56:54,041 --> 03:56:56,680
right?
So the best physicist is a computer.

4921
03:56:56,820 --> 03:57:01,820
You know,
the best medical diagnostician is a 

4922
03:57:01,820 --> 03:57:01,820
computer.
The best.

4923
03:57:01,820 --> 03:57:04,270
A prover of math.
Theorems has a computer,

4924
03:57:04,271 --> 03:57:05,860
the best engineers,
a computer,

4925
03:57:05,890 --> 03:57:06,730
right?
Then there's no,

4926
03:57:06,760 --> 03:57:08,920
there's no reason why we're not headed 
there.

4927
03:57:08,950 --> 03:57:13,950
I mean,
it would be the only reason I could see 

4928
03:57:13,950 --> 03:57:16,111
we're not headed there is it something 
massively dislocating happens that 

4929
03:57:16,111 --> 03:57:19,570
prevents us from continuing to improve 
our intelligent machines.

4930
03:57:19,571 --> 03:57:24,571
But if you just the moment admit that 
intelligence is just a matter of 

4931
03:57:24,571 --> 03:57:28,601
information processing and you admit 
that we will continue to improve our 

4932
03:57:28,791 --> 03:57:33,791
machines unless something heinous 
happens because it's intelligence and 

4933
03:57:33,791 --> 03:57:35,240
automation are the most valuable things 
we have.

4934
03:57:35,840 --> 03:57:37,970
Um,
at a certain point,

4935
03:57:37,971 --> 03:57:40,610
whether you think it's in five years or 
500 years,

4936
03:57:41,150 --> 03:57:45,590
we're going to find ourselves in the 
presence of superintelligent machines.

4937
03:57:45,590 --> 03:57:50,590
And then at that point,
the best source of innovation for the 

4938
03:57:51,771 --> 03:57:56,771
next generation of software or hardware 
or both will be the machines themselves.

4939
03:57:57,650 --> 03:57:58,580
Right?
So then you.

4940
03:57:58,880 --> 03:58:01,220
So then you just have,
then that's where you get what,

4941
03:58:01,490 --> 03:58:05,180
what was,
what the mathematician Ij good described

4942
03:58:05,181 --> 03:58:06,650
as,
as the intelligence explosion,

4943
03:58:06,651 --> 03:58:09,590
which is just that the process can take 
off on its own.

4944
03:58:10,220 --> 03:58:11,450
And this is where,
you know,

4945
03:58:11,451 --> 03:58:13,910
the singularity people,
um,

4946
03:58:14,840 --> 03:58:19,840
either either are hopeful or worried,
but because there's nothing,

4947
03:58:20,060 --> 03:58:25,060
there's no guarantee that this process 
will be remain aligned with our 

4948
03:58:25,491 --> 03:58:26,210
interests.
And,

4949
03:58:26,320 --> 03:58:28,790
and every person who I meet even,
you know,

4950
03:58:28,791 --> 03:58:31,090
very smart people like Neil,
um,

4951
03:58:31,850 --> 03:58:36,850
who says they're not worried about this,
when you actually drill down on why 

4952
03:58:36,850 --> 03:58:41,441
they're not worried,
you find that they're actually not 

4953
03:58:41,441 --> 03:58:44,531
imagining machines making changes to 
their own source code.

4954
03:58:45,630 --> 03:58:50,160
Um,
and they're not [inaudible] they're,

4955
03:58:50,230 --> 03:58:55,230
they,
they simply believe that this is so far 

4956
03:58:55,230 --> 03:58:56,990
away that we don't have to worry about 
it now.

4957
03:58:57,410 --> 03:59:02,410
Right?
And that's actually a nonsequitor I 

4958
03:59:02,410 --> 03:59:02,410
mean,
to say that this is far away,

4959
03:59:02,410 --> 03:59:06,940
is not actually grappling with.
It's not an argument that this isn't 

4960
03:59:06,940 --> 03:59:08,330
going to happen.
And um,

4961
03:59:08,590 --> 03:59:10,520
and it's based on what to,
and it's,

4962
03:59:10,521 --> 03:59:12,290
and it's based on,
first of all,

4963
03:59:12,320 --> 03:59:15,620
there's no,
there's no reason to believe.

4964
03:59:16,370 --> 03:59:19,590
Jamie want to find out where it is.
Um,

4965
03:59:21,320 --> 03:59:26,320
there's no,
I mean we don't know how long it will 

4966
03:59:26,320 --> 03:59:26,320
take us to prepare for this,
right?

4967
03:59:26,320 --> 03:59:26,390
So like,
like if you were,

4968
03:59:26,420 --> 03:59:31,420
if you knew this was going to take 50 
years for this to happen,

4969
03:59:32,840 --> 03:59:37,840
is 50 years enough for us to prepare 
politically and economically to deal 

4970
03:59:37,840 --> 03:59:42,221
with the ramifications of this and to do
it and to say nothing of actually 

4971
03:59:42,221 --> 03:59:45,980
building the ai safely in a way that's 
aligned with our interests.

4972
03:59:46,310 --> 03:59:47,540
I don't know.
I mean 50,

4973
03:59:47,541 --> 03:59:51,810
so 50 years is we've had the iphone for 
what,

4974
03:59:51,860 --> 03:59:52,520
10 years?

4975
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:55,940
Nine years.
It's like 50 years.

4976
03:59:55,941 --> 03:59:57,430
Not a lot of time right.
To,

4977
03:59:57,480 --> 03:59:58,670
to deal,
to deal with this.

4978
03:59:58,730 --> 04:00:03,730
And um,
this has no reason to think it's,

4979
04:00:04,040 --> 04:00:07,670
it's that far away if we keep making 
progress.

4980
04:00:07,671 --> 04:00:08,630
I mean it's,
it's not,

4981
04:00:08,770 --> 04:00:10,700
it will be amazing if it were 500 years 
away.

4982
04:00:11,060 --> 04:00:12,470
I mean that,
that seems like it's,

4983
04:00:12,490 --> 04:00:16,850
it's,
it's more likely from what I mean,

4984
04:00:16,940 --> 04:00:19,950
the sense I get from the people who are 
doing this work,

4985
04:00:20,610 --> 04:00:25,470
it's far more likely to be 50 years than
500 years.

4986
04:00:25,800 --> 04:00:27,120
Like,
you know,

4987
04:00:27,330 --> 04:00:32,330
I'm uh,
I mean the peanut that people who think 

4988
04:00:32,461 --> 04:00:36,920
this is a long,
long way off or they're saying,

4989
04:00:37,790 --> 04:00:40,020
you know,
50 to 100 years,

4990
04:00:40,830 --> 04:00:43,340
no one says 500 years.
No,

4991
04:00:43,360 --> 04:00:44,490
no.
As far as I know,

4992
04:00:44,540 --> 04:00:49,540
no one who is actually close to this 
work and some people think it could be 

4993
04:00:49,540 --> 04:00:50,250
in five years,
right?

4994
04:00:50,250 --> 04:00:51,620
I mean the people who are,
you know,

4995
04:00:51,750 --> 04:00:55,710
like the deep mind people who are very 
close to this or are the sorts of people

4996
04:00:55,711 --> 04:01:00,711
who say because the people,
the people who are close to this work 

4997
04:01:00,711 --> 04:01:02,370
are astonished by what's happened in the
last 10 years.

4998
04:01:02,390 --> 04:01:07,390
Like we went from a place of very little
progress to,

4999
04:01:07,890 --> 04:01:09,000
you know,
wow,

5000
04:01:09,001 --> 04:01:13,290
this is all of a sudden really,
really interesting and powerful.

5001
04:01:13,350 --> 04:01:17,190
And um,
and again,

5002
04:01:17,280 --> 04:01:19,740
progress is compounding in a way that's 
counter intuitive.

5003
04:01:19,741 --> 04:01:24,741
People systematically overestimate how 
much change can happen in a year and 

5004
04:01:25,261 --> 04:01:27,480
underestimate how much change can happen
in 10 years.

5005
04:01:27,481 --> 04:01:28,230
And I,
you know,

5006
04:01:28,560 --> 04:01:31,470
as far as estimating how much change can
happen in 50 or 100 years,

5007
04:01:31,980 --> 04:01:33,810
I don't know that anyone is good at 
that.

5008
04:01:36,370 --> 04:01:41,370
How could you be with giant leaps come 
giant exponential leaps off those leaps 

5009
04:01:41,651 --> 04:01:46,651
and it's.
It's almost impossible for us to really 

5010
04:01:46,651 --> 04:01:47,110
predict what we're going to be looking 
at 50 years from now,

5011
04:01:47,530 --> 04:01:50,680
but I don't.
I don't know what they're going to think

5012
04:01:50,681 --> 04:01:55,681
about us.
That's what's most bizarre about it as 

5013
04:01:55,681 --> 04:01:58,741
well.
We really might be obsolete if we look 

5014
04:01:58,741 --> 04:02:00,070
at how ridiculous we are.
Look at this political campaign,

5015
04:02:00,071 --> 04:02:01,930
look at what we pay attention to in the 
news,

5016
04:02:01,960 --> 04:02:04,990
look at the things we really focus on 
where are strange,

5017
04:02:04,991 --> 04:02:09,991
ridiculous animal,
and if we look back on some strange 

5018
04:02:10,391 --> 04:02:13,360
dinosaur that had a weird neck,
why should that fucking thing make it?

5019
04:02:13,770 --> 04:02:15,040
You know,
why should we make it?

5020
04:02:15,310 --> 04:02:20,310
We might be here to make that thing and 
that thing takes over from here with no 

5021
04:02:20,771 --> 04:02:22,120
emotions,
no lust,

5022
04:02:22,121 --> 04:02:27,121
no greed,
and just purely existing electronically 

5023
04:02:27,121 --> 04:02:27,250
and for what reason?

5024
04:02:27,450 --> 04:02:28,710
Well,
that that's a little scary.

5025
04:02:28,711 --> 04:02:31,560
There are,
there are computer scientists who,

5026
04:02:31,561 --> 04:02:36,561
when you talk about why they're not 
worried or talk to them about why 

5027
04:02:36,561 --> 04:02:40,161
they're not worried,
they just swallow this pill without any 

5028
04:02:40,951 --> 04:02:45,951
qualm like we're gonna make the thing 
that is far more powerful and beautiful 

5029
04:02:46,350 --> 04:02:51,350
and important than we are.
And it doesn't matter what happens to 

5030
04:02:51,350 --> 04:02:51,900
us.
I mean that was our role.

5031
04:02:51,901 --> 04:02:56,700
Our role was to build these mechanical 
gods and,

5032
04:02:57,420 --> 04:03:01,810
and it's fine if they squash us and 
I've,

5033
04:03:01,811 --> 04:03:03,330
yeah,
I've literally heard a,

5034
04:03:03,430 --> 04:03:05,880
a people say I've heard someone give a 
talk.

5035
04:03:06,450 --> 04:03:08,580
That's what woke me up to,
oh,

5036
04:03:08,990 --> 04:03:11,790
to how interesting this areas.
I went to this conference in,

5037
04:03:11,970 --> 04:03:16,970
in San Juan about a year ago and there 
were a,

5038
04:03:17,500 --> 04:03:22,500
you know,
like the people from deep mind where 

5039
04:03:22,500 --> 04:03:22,720
they are and the people who were very 
close to this work were there.

5040
04:03:23,170 --> 04:03:28,170
And I'm going to hear some of the 
reasons why you shouldn't be worried 

5041
04:03:29,260 --> 04:03:32,670
from people who were interested in 
common.

5042
04:03:32,680 --> 04:03:35,410
The fear is so they could get on with 
doing their very important work.

5043
04:03:35,890 --> 04:03:40,890
Um,
it was amazing because they were highly 

5044
04:03:41,080 --> 04:03:46,080
uncompelling reasons not to be worried 
was just so,

5045
04:03:47,950 --> 04:03:50,860
so they had a,
they had a desire to be compelled.

5046
04:03:51,010 --> 04:03:52,730
They're not,
they're not at all.

5047
04:03:52,890 --> 04:03:55,660
I will know that people,
people want to do this.

5048
04:03:56,560 --> 04:04:01,560
There's a deep assumption in many of 
these people that we can figure it out 

5049
04:04:01,901 --> 04:04:03,240
as we go along.
Right.

5050
04:04:04,160 --> 04:04:09,160
You know,
it's just like we're gonna we're just 

5051
04:04:09,160 --> 04:04:09,160
gonna get going to get closer.
We're foot.

5052
04:04:09,160 --> 04:04:10,360
We're far enough away now,
even five year.

5053
04:04:10,361 --> 04:04:11,680
Even if it's five years,
five years,

5054
04:04:11,710 --> 04:04:12,040
we'll,
we'll,

5055
04:04:12,070 --> 04:04:13,350
we'll get there.
Once we get closer,

5056
04:04:13,360 --> 04:04:18,360
once we get something a little scary,
then we'll pull the brakes and talk 

5057
04:04:18,360 --> 04:04:18,550
about it.

5058
04:04:19,060 --> 04:04:24,060
But the problem is they are assigned.
Everyone is essentially in a race 

5059
04:04:24,060 --> 04:04:24,780
condition by default and you have,
you know,

5060
04:04:24,820 --> 04:04:29,820
Google is racing against facebook and 
the US is racing against China and 

5061
04:04:29,820 --> 04:04:34,140
every,
every group is racing against every 

5062
04:04:34,140 --> 04:04:34,140
other group.
Um,

5063
04:04:34,330 --> 04:04:36,910
however you want to conceive of groups.
This is a,

5064
04:04:37,300 --> 04:04:42,300
to be the first one to be the first one 
with an incredibly powerful,

5065
04:04:44,891 --> 04:04:48,310
narrow ai is to be the next,
you know,

5066
04:04:48,340 --> 04:04:51,370
multibillion dollar company,
right?

5067
04:04:51,371 --> 04:04:54,520
So everyone's trying to get there and 
uh,

5068
04:04:54,580 --> 04:04:59,580
if they suddenly get there and sort of 
overshoot a little bit and now they've 

5069
04:04:59,580 --> 04:05:02,491
got something like general intelligence 
or something close to what we're relying

5070
04:05:02,980 --> 04:05:07,980
on every.
And they know everyone else is 

5071
04:05:07,980 --> 04:05:07,980
attempting to do this,
right?

5072
04:05:07,980 --> 04:05:11,970
Um,
W we don't have a system set up where 

5073
04:05:11,970 --> 04:05:13,360
everyone can pull the breaks together 
and say,

5074
04:05:13,361 --> 04:05:15,490
listen,
we've got to stop racing here.

5075
04:05:15,490 --> 04:05:20,490
We have to share everything.
We have to share the wealth with the 

5076
04:05:20,490 --> 04:05:23,521
share the information we have to um,
this truly has to be open source in 

5077
04:05:23,521 --> 04:05:25,740
every conceivable way.
And um,

5078
04:05:26,080 --> 04:05:29,860
we have to diffuse this winner take all 
dynamic.

5079
04:05:30,280 --> 04:05:32,110
Um,
you know,

5080
04:05:32,111 --> 04:05:37,111
I think we need something like a 
Manhattan project to figure out how to 

5081
04:05:37,111 --> 04:05:37,111
do that,
you know,

5082
04:05:37,111 --> 04:05:38,440
not,
not to figure out how to build the AI,

5083
04:05:38,441 --> 04:05:43,441
but to figure out how to,
to build it in a way that does not 

5084
04:05:43,441 --> 04:05:46,591
create an arms race that does not create
an incentive to build unsafe ai,

5085
04:05:47,891 --> 04:05:52,891
which is almost certainly going to be 
easier than building safe ai interested 

5086
04:05:52,891 --> 04:05:55,590
to work out all of these issues because 
it's not because what I think we are,

5087
04:05:55,591 --> 04:06:00,591
we're going to build this by default.
We're just going to keep building more 

5088
04:06:00,591 --> 04:06:04,891
and more intelligent machines and this 
is going to be done in by everyone who 

5089
04:06:06,360 --> 04:06:09,700
can,
can do it with each generation.

5090
04:06:09,700 --> 04:06:11,110
If we were even talking about 
generations,

5091
04:06:11,111 --> 04:06:14,740
it's going to be.
It will have the tools made by the prior

5092
04:06:15,890 --> 04:06:19,790
that are more powerful than anyone 
imagined 100 years ago and it just going

5093
04:06:19,810 --> 04:06:24,810
to keep going like that.
Did anybody actually make that quote 

5094
04:06:24,810 --> 04:06:27,490
about giving birth to the mechanical 
gods or.

5095
04:06:27,500 --> 04:06:29,370
That was just made,
but it was,

5096
04:06:29,900 --> 04:06:32,720
there was a scientist that actually was 
thinking and saying that,

5097
04:06:32,750 --> 04:06:37,750
but that was,
that was the content of what he was 

5098
04:06:37,750 --> 04:06:37,750
saying.
He's,

5099
04:06:37,750 --> 04:06:41,610
we're going to build the next species 
that is far more important than we are 

5100
04:06:42,590 --> 04:06:44,260
and that's a good thing.
And it,

5101
04:06:44,410 --> 04:06:47,050
and actually I can go there with him.
I mean,

5102
04:06:47,090 --> 04:06:48,410
it actually,
the only,

5103
04:06:48,411 --> 04:06:53,411
the only caveat here is that unless 
they're not conscious,

5104
04:06:54,080 --> 04:06:59,080
right?
Like say if the true horror for me is 

5105
04:06:59,080 --> 04:06:59,930
that we can build things more 
intelligent than we are,

5106
04:07:00,410 --> 04:07:05,410
more powerful than we are a and that can
squash us and they might not.

5107
04:07:07,050 --> 04:07:08,600
They might be unconscious,
right?

5108
04:07:08,610 --> 04:07:13,610
That there might be nothing like the 
universe could go dark if they squashes 

5109
04:07:13,610 --> 04:07:13,610
right,
or,

5110
04:07:13,610 --> 04:07:14,400
or at least our corner of the universe 
could go dark.

5111
04:07:15,320 --> 04:07:17,120
And yet these things will be immensely 
powerful.

5112
04:07:17,460 --> 04:07:19,940
Um,
so if,

5113
04:07:20,080 --> 04:07:20,920
and this is just,
you know,

5114
04:07:20,930 --> 04:07:25,930
the jury's out on this,
but if there's nothing about 

5115
04:07:25,930 --> 04:07:27,650
intelligence scaling that demands that 
consciousness come along for the ride,

5116
04:07:28,350 --> 04:07:30,950
um,
then it's possible that,

5117
04:07:30,970 --> 04:07:32,790
I mean nobody thinks our machines are,
you know,

5118
04:07:32,810 --> 04:07:36,320
very few people would think are machines
that are intelligent or conscious.

5119
04:07:36,380 --> 04:07:38,870
Right?
So at what point does consciousness come

5120
04:07:38,871 --> 04:07:43,730
online or maybe it's possible to build 
super intelligence that's unconscious,

5121
04:07:44,340 --> 04:07:45,770
you know,
super powerful,

5122
04:07:45,800 --> 04:07:47,960
does everything better than we do,
you know,

5123
04:07:47,961 --> 04:07:50,330
it'll recognize your emotion better 
than,

5124
04:07:50,420 --> 04:07:54,980
than another person can,
but then the lights aren't on that.

5125
04:07:55,190 --> 04:07:56,620
That's,
that's also,

5126
04:07:56,621 --> 04:07:59,090
I think possible,
but maybe it's not possible,

5127
04:07:59,900 --> 04:08:04,900
but that's,
that's the worst case scenario because 

5128
04:08:04,900 --> 04:08:06,970
in the ethical silver lining,
in speaking outside of our self interest

5129
04:08:08,030 --> 04:08:10,670
now,
but just from a bird's eye view,

5130
04:08:12,770 --> 04:08:16,880
the ethical silver lining to building 
these mechanical gods that are conscious

5131
04:08:16,881 --> 04:08:17,660
is that yes,
okay,

5132
04:08:17,670 --> 04:08:22,670
we've,
in fact if we have built something that 

5133
04:08:22,670 --> 04:08:25,840
is far wiser and has far more beautiful 
experiences and deeper experiences of 

5134
04:08:26,301 --> 04:08:27,980
the universe and we could ever imagine.

5135
04:08:28,820 --> 04:08:31,760
And there there's something that it's 
like to be that thing that's just,

5136
04:08:31,970 --> 04:08:34,190
you know,
it is a hesitant kind of a godlike,

5137
04:08:34,800 --> 04:08:38,270
a experience.
Well that would be a very good thing.

5138
04:08:38,810 --> 04:08:41,330
Then we will have built and we will have
built something that was,

5139
04:08:41,360 --> 04:08:46,360
you know,
if you stand outside of our narrow self 

5140
04:08:46,360 --> 04:08:46,360
interest,
I can understand why the,

5141
04:08:46,490 --> 04:08:51,490
he would say that he was just assuming 
what was scary about that particular 

5142
04:08:51,490 --> 04:08:56,111
talk because he was assuming that 
consciousness comes along for the ride 

5143
04:08:56,450 --> 04:09:01,450
here.
And I don't know that that is a safe 

5144
04:09:01,450 --> 04:09:02,600
assumption,
but this really terrifying thing is who,

5145
04:09:03,290 --> 04:09:03,930
if,
if,

5146
04:09:03,970 --> 04:09:08,970
if this is constantly improving itself 
and it's under the Beck and call of a 

5147
04:09:08,970 --> 04:09:12,780
person then.
So it's either conscious conscious where

5148
04:09:12,810 --> 04:09:14,250
it as itself,
right?

5149
04:09:14,310 --> 04:09:16,950
It acts as an individual thinking unit.
Right?

5150
04:09:16,951 --> 04:09:20,370
Or as a thing outside of it's aware,
right?

5151
04:09:20,430 --> 04:09:25,430
Either it is or it isn't.
And if it isn't aware and some person 

5152
04:09:25,430 --> 04:09:27,720
can manipulate it,
like imagine if it's getting 10,000.

5153
04:09:27,721 --> 04:09:32,721
How many,
how many thousands of years in a week 

5154
04:09:32,721 --> 04:09:32,721
did you say?
If it was just improvement,

5155
04:09:32,721 --> 04:09:35,190
it was just a million times faster than 
we are.

5156
04:09:35,191 --> 04:09:36,450
It's 20,000
years,

5157
04:09:36,790 --> 04:09:39,000
20,000
years in a week and a week in a week.

5158
04:09:39,210 --> 04:09:43,770
So with every week this thing constantly
gets better at even doing that.

5159
04:09:43,800 --> 04:09:45,480
Right?
So it's reprogramming itself.

5160
04:09:45,481 --> 04:09:47,160
So it's all exponential.

5161
04:09:48,090 --> 04:09:50,440
Presumably it just,
it just imagine again,

5162
04:09:50,441 --> 04:09:54,090
if you could keep it in the most 
restricted case,

5163
04:09:54,091 --> 04:09:55,920
you could just keep it at our level,

5164
04:09:56,630 --> 04:09:58,040
just,
just faster,

5165
04:09:58,130 --> 04:09:59,870
just a million times faster.
But if it did,

5166
04:09:59,930 --> 04:10:01,820
all of these things,
if it kept going and kept,

5167
04:10:01,821 --> 04:10:05,150
every week was thousands of years,
we're going to control it.

5168
04:10:05,330 --> 04:10:09,080
A person that's even more insane.
Just imagine being and

5169
04:10:09,090 --> 04:10:14,010
dialogue with something that had,
that lived the 20,000

5170
04:10:14,011 --> 04:10:17,880
years of human progress in a week and 
you come back,

5171
04:10:17,900 --> 04:10:19,440
you know,
on Monday and say,

5172
04:10:19,441 --> 04:10:20,180
listen,
um,

5173
04:10:20,260 --> 04:10:20,730
I,
I,

5174
04:10:20,731 --> 04:10:25,731
that thing I told you to do last Monday,
I want to change that up and this thing 

5175
04:10:25,731 --> 04:10:26,760
has made 20,000
years of progress.

5176
04:10:27,110 --> 04:10:32,110
Um,
and if it's in a condition where it has 

5177
04:10:32,110 --> 04:10:32,110
access,
I mean,

5178
04:10:32,110 --> 04:10:32,700
so we're imagining this thing,
you know,

5179
04:10:32,780 --> 04:10:33,900
in a box,
you know,

5180
04:10:34,040 --> 04:10:37,500
air gapped from the Internet and it's 
got nothing.

5181
04:10:37,501 --> 04:10:38,910
It's got no way to get out,
right?

5182
04:10:39,340 --> 04:10:41,940
Uh,
even that is an unstable situation,

5183
04:10:41,941 --> 04:10:45,870
but just imagine this emerging in some 
way online,

5184
04:10:45,871 --> 04:10:47,730
right?
Already being out in the wild,

5185
04:10:47,731 --> 04:10:49,560
right?
So let's say it's in a financial market,

5186
04:10:49,590 --> 04:10:50,840
right?
Um,

5187
04:10:51,960 --> 04:10:56,960
that's again,
this is what worries me most about this 

5188
04:10:56,960 --> 04:10:59,220
and what is also interesting is that our
intuitions here,

5189
04:10:59,700 --> 04:11:02,520
I think the primary intuition that 
people have is no,

5190
04:11:02,800 --> 04:11:02,980
no,
no,

5191
04:11:02,990 --> 04:11:03,540
no,
that's just,

5192
04:11:03,600 --> 04:11:07,200
that's just not possible or not at all 
likely,

5193
04:11:07,740 --> 04:11:10,800
but if you're going to find,
you're going to think it's impossible or

5194
04:11:10,830 --> 04:11:15,830
even unlikely,
you have to find something wrong with 

5195
04:11:15,830 --> 04:11:15,830
the claim.

5196
04:11:15,930 --> 04:11:20,430
That intelligence is just a matter of 
information processing.

5197
04:11:21,150 --> 04:11:26,150
Um,
I don't know any scientific reason to 

5198
04:11:26,150 --> 04:11:27,150
doubt that claim at the moment.
Um,

5199
04:11:27,750 --> 04:11:32,190
and a very good reasons to believe that 
it's just undoubtable,

5200
04:11:32,700 --> 04:11:35,150
uh,
and the,

5201
04:11:35,400 --> 04:11:40,400
and you have to doubt that we will 
continue to make progress in the design 

5202
04:11:41,671 --> 04:11:43,350
of intelligent machines.
And,

5203
04:11:44,130 --> 04:11:45,820
but once you,
then it's,

5204
04:11:45,860 --> 04:11:48,150
then the,
all this left is just time,

5205
04:11:48,540 --> 04:11:48,950
right?
If,

5206
04:11:48,951 --> 04:11:53,951
if,
if intelligence is just information 

5207
04:11:53,951 --> 04:11:56,391
processing and we,
we're going to continue to build better 

5208
04:11:56,391 --> 04:12:01,371
and better information processors,
at a certain point we're going to build 

5209
04:12:02,521 --> 04:12:05,300
something that is super human.
Um,

5210
04:12:06,480 --> 04:12:11,210
and so whether it's in five years or 50,
it's a huge.

5211
04:12:11,350 --> 04:12:11,780
I mean,
it's,

5212
04:12:11,820 --> 04:12:15,190
it's the biggest change in human history
I think we can imagine,

5213
04:12:15,280 --> 04:12:16,850
right?
Um,

5214
04:12:17,350 --> 04:12:18,750
so,
uh,

5215
04:12:19,300 --> 04:12:20,990
and,
and people I what I felt fine,

5216
04:12:21,010 --> 04:12:23,560
I keep finding myself in the presence of
people who seem,

5217
04:12:24,100 --> 04:12:28,120
at least to my eye to be refusing to 
imagine it like that they're treating it

5218
04:12:28,121 --> 04:12:33,121
like the y two k virus or whatever where
it's just the y two k bug where it just 

5219
04:12:33,251 --> 04:12:35,170
may or may not be an issue.
Right?

5220
04:12:35,171 --> 04:12:35,370
Like,
it,

5221
04:12:35,380 --> 04:12:37,600
like it's a hypothetical,
like maybe this is just,

5222
04:12:37,601 --> 04:12:39,430
we're going to get there and it's going 
to be.

5223
04:12:39,670 --> 04:12:42,610
It's either not going to happen or it's 
going to be trivial,

5224
04:12:42,640 --> 04:12:47,640
but how you don't,
if you don't have an argument for why 

5225
04:12:47,640 --> 04:12:47,640
this isn't going to happen,

5226
04:12:48,350 --> 04:12:48,740
uh,

5227
04:12:49,220 --> 04:12:51,590
then you have to have then then you're 
left with,

5228
04:12:51,620 --> 04:12:56,620
okay,
what's it going to be like to have 

5229
04:12:56,810 --> 04:13:01,810
systems that are better than we are at 
everything in the entire intellectual 

5230
04:13:03,021 --> 04:13:03,470
space.

5231
04:13:04,100 --> 04:13:07,420
Um,
and

5232
04:13:08,970 --> 04:13:13,970
you know,
what will happen if that suddenly 

5233
04:13:13,970 --> 04:13:13,970
happens in one country and not in 
another,

5234
04:13:13,970 --> 04:13:13,970
right?
It's um,

5235
04:13:14,910 --> 04:13:15,570
it's,
uh,

5236
04:13:16,410 --> 04:13:16,870
it's,
I mean,

5237
04:13:16,880 --> 04:13:19,470
it has enormous implications,
but it just sounds like science fiction.

5238
04:13:20,070 --> 04:13:24,420
I don't know what's scarier.
The idea that an artificial intelligence

5239
04:13:24,421 --> 04:13:25,770
can emerge,
it's conscious,

5240
04:13:25,771 --> 04:13:28,740
it's aware of itself,
and then acts to present per,

5241
04:13:28,750 --> 04:13:32,250
per protect itself,
or the idea that a person,

5242
04:13:33,180 --> 04:13:38,180
a regular person like,
have today could be in control of 

5243
04:13:38,180 --> 04:13:38,370
essentially a god.
Right?

5244
04:13:38,610 --> 04:13:43,610
Because if this thing continues to get 
smarter and smarter with every week and 

5245
04:13:43,610 --> 04:13:44,370
more and more power and more and more 
potential,

5246
04:13:44,880 --> 04:13:46,980
more and more understanding,
thousands of years,

5247
04:13:46,981 --> 04:13:48,870
I mean it's just,
yeah,

5248
04:13:49,050 --> 04:13:54,050
this one person,
a regular person controlling that is 

5249
04:13:54,050 --> 04:13:55,980
almost more terrifying than creating a 
new line or,

5250
04:13:56,020 --> 04:14:01,020
or any group of people who don't have 
the total welfare of humanity as their 

5251
04:14:01,201 --> 04:14:02,010
central concern.

5252
04:14:02,330 --> 04:14:05,160
And so just imagine what would,
what would China do with it now?

5253
04:14:05,220 --> 04:14:06,030
Right?
What would we,

5254
04:14:06,060 --> 04:14:08,400
what would we do if we thought China,
you know,

5255
04:14:08,570 --> 04:14:12,570
Baidu or what are some Chinese company 
was on the verge of this thing?

5256
04:14:13,740 --> 04:14:15,930
What would it be rational for us to do?
You know,

5257
04:14:16,230 --> 04:14:17,850
if North Korea had it,
it would,

5258
04:14:17,940 --> 04:14:22,940
it would be rational to nuke them given 
what they say about their relationship 

5259
04:14:23,011 --> 04:14:25,810
with the rest of the.
So it's um,

5260
04:14:26,740 --> 04:14:30,750
well that kind of rational,
that kind of power is.

5261
04:14:30,751 --> 04:14:34,500
It's so life changing.
It's so paradigm shifting,

5262
04:14:35,400 --> 04:14:40,400
right?
But if you have to wind this back to 

5263
04:14:40,400 --> 04:14:40,400
what someone like Neil degrasse Tyson 
would say,

5264
04:14:40,400 --> 04:14:44,160
is that the only basis for fear is,
yeah,

5265
04:14:44,190 --> 04:14:47,220
don't give your superintelligent ai to 
the next Hitler,

5266
04:14:47,430 --> 04:14:48,120
right?
That's,

5267
04:14:48,240 --> 04:14:50,550
that's obviously bad.
But if we don't,

5268
04:14:50,610 --> 04:14:54,780
if we're not idiots and we just use it,
well,

5269
04:14:55,560 --> 04:14:58,050
we're fine.
And that I think is an intuition that is

5270
04:14:58,051 --> 04:15:00,180
just,
that's just a failure to,

5271
04:15:00,810 --> 04:15:03,810
to unpack what is entailed by,

5272
04:15:05,630 --> 04:15:10,630
again,
something like an intelligence 

5273
04:15:10,630 --> 04:15:10,630
explosion,
a process that once,

5274
04:15:10,630 --> 04:15:15,130
once you're,
you're talking about something that is 

5275
04:15:15,130 --> 04:15:17,500
able to change itself and you have to 
get.

5276
04:15:17,570 --> 04:15:20,080
So what would it be like to guarantee 
level?

5277
04:15:20,090 --> 04:15:20,900
So we decide,
okay,

5278
04:15:20,901 --> 04:15:25,901
we're just not going to build anything 
that can make changes to his own source 

5279
04:15:25,901 --> 04:15:25,901
code.
You know,

5280
04:15:25,901 --> 04:15:25,901
any change to,
to,

5281
04:15:25,901 --> 04:15:30,110
to software to certain point is going to
have to be run through a human brain.

5282
04:15:30,580 --> 04:15:32,060
Um,
and we're going to have veto power.

5283
04:15:32,061 --> 04:15:37,061
Well,
is every person working on ai going to 

5284
04:15:37,061 --> 04:15:40,601
abide by that rule?
It's like what we agreed not to clone 

5285
04:15:40,601 --> 04:15:40,601
humans,
right?

5286
04:15:40,601 --> 04:15:44,171
But we're going to stand by that 
agreement for in the rest of human 

5287
04:15:44,171 --> 04:15:44,260
history and is,
you know,

5288
04:15:44,940 --> 04:15:49,940
is our agreement binding on China or 
Singapore or any other country that 

5289
04:15:50,000 --> 04:15:51,770
might think otherwise,
it's just,

5290
04:15:52,080 --> 04:15:54,890
it's a free for all and at a certain 
point we're going to be,

5291
04:15:55,670 --> 04:15:57,140
you know,
close enough,

5292
04:15:57,530 --> 04:16:01,160
everyone's going to be close enough to 
making the final breakthrough that,

5293
04:16:01,350 --> 04:16:06,350
um,
unless we have some agreement about how 

5294
04:16:06,350 --> 04:16:09,470
to proceed if someone is going to get 
there first,

5295
04:16:11,120 --> 04:16:14,390
that is a terrifying scenario of the 
future.

5296
04:16:15,350 --> 04:16:20,350
You know,
you cemented this last time you were 

5297
04:16:20,350 --> 04:16:20,750
here,
but not as extreme as this time.

5298
04:16:20,751 --> 04:16:22,400
You seem to be accelerating the 
rhetoric.

5299
04:16:23,030 --> 04:16:23,680
Exactly,
yes.

5300
04:16:25,450 --> 04:16:28,580
You're going deep.
Boy,

5301
04:16:28,590 --> 04:16:31,860
hope you're wrong.
I'm on team Neil degrasse Tyson.

5302
04:16:31,930 --> 04:16:34,890
This one go neil,
um,

5303
04:16:35,000 --> 04:16:38,900
and well and so in defensive of the 
other side too.

5304
04:16:38,901 --> 04:16:41,510
I should say that.
So David Deutsch also thinks I'm wrong,

5305
04:16:41,570 --> 04:16:46,570
but he thinks I'm wrong because we will 
integrate ourselves with these machines.

5306
04:16:47,211 --> 04:16:48,230
I mean,
so this will be,

5307
04:16:48,231 --> 04:16:53,231
there'll be extensions of ourselves and 
they can't help but be aligned with us 

5308
04:16:53,231 --> 04:16:53,960
because we will,
we will be connected to them.

5309
04:16:54,170 --> 04:16:56,000
That seems to be the only way we could 
all get along.

5310
04:16:56,001 --> 04:16:57,290
We have to merge,
become one,

5311
04:16:57,620 --> 04:17:01,010
but I just think there's no,
there's no deep reason why,

5312
04:17:01,040 --> 04:17:03,110
like even if we decided to do that,
right,

5313
04:17:03,111 --> 04:17:04,700
like in the US or,
or,

5314
04:17:04,790 --> 04:17:08,090
or in half the world one,
there's,

5315
04:17:08,091 --> 04:17:10,850
I think there are reasons to worry that 
even that could go haywire,

5316
04:17:10,851 --> 04:17:15,851
but there's no guarantee that someone 
else couldn't just build ai in a box.

5317
04:17:16,070 --> 04:17:16,500
I mean,
if we're,

5318
04:17:16,530 --> 04:17:20,030
if we can build ai such that we can 
merge our brains with it.

5319
04:17:20,600 --> 04:17:23,480
Um,
someone can also just build ai in a box,

5320
04:17:23,720 --> 04:17:24,300
right?
And,

5321
04:17:24,490 --> 04:17:25,550
and that's,
uh,

5322
04:17:26,670 --> 04:17:27,590
um,
and then,

5323
04:17:27,620 --> 04:17:29,900
then you inherit all the other problems 
that people are saying,

5324
04:17:29,901 --> 04:17:32,540
we don't have to worry about if it was a
good Cohen brothers movie,

5325
04:17:32,541 --> 04:17:36,080
it would be invented in the middle of 
the presidency of Donald Trump.

5326
04:17:36,410 --> 04:17:38,900
And so then that's when ai would go 
live.

5327
04:17:39,110 --> 04:17:41,330
And then ai would have to challenge 
Donald Trump.

5328
04:17:41,360 --> 04:17:42,980
They'd would have like an insult 
contest,

5329
04:17:44,670 --> 04:17:49,670
but that,
that that's when this thing becomes so 

5330
04:17:49,670 --> 04:17:53,860
comically a terrifying.
Whereas just just imagine Donald Trump 

5331
04:17:54,680 --> 04:17:59,680
being in a position to make the final 
decisions on topics like this for the 

5332
04:18:02,631 --> 04:18:06,080
country that is act is going to do this 
almost certainly in the near term.

5333
04:18:06,110 --> 04:18:11,110
It's like,
should we have a Manhattan project on 

5334
04:18:11,110 --> 04:18:11,110
this point,
Mr.

5335
04:18:11,110 --> 04:18:11,700
President,
um,

5336
04:18:13,390 --> 04:18:16,800
you know,
the idea that anything of value could be

5337
04:18:16,801 --> 04:18:19,320
happening between his ears on this 
topic.

5338
04:18:19,321 --> 04:18:24,210
We're 100 others like it I think is now 
really inconceivable.

5339
04:18:25,170 --> 04:18:27,370
And so what,
uh,

5340
04:18:27,380 --> 04:18:28,820
what,
what price could we,

5341
04:18:28,830 --> 04:18:31,610
might we pay for that kind of 
inattention and,

5342
04:18:32,510 --> 04:18:37,320
and self satisfied in attention to these
kinds of issues?

5343
04:18:37,830 --> 04:18:38,400
Well,
this,

5344
04:18:38,490 --> 04:18:43,490
this issue,
if this is real and if this could go 

5345
04:18:43,490 --> 04:18:44,880
live in 50 years,
this is the issue you're in.

5346
04:18:44,940 --> 04:18:49,940
Unless we fuck ourselves up beyond 
repair before then and shut the power 

5347
04:18:49,940 --> 04:18:51,300
off if it keeps going.
Yeah.

5348
04:18:51,301 --> 04:18:52,230
No,
I think it is.

5349
04:18:52,290 --> 04:18:57,290
I think it is the issue,
but unfortunately it's the issue that 

5350
04:18:57,290 --> 04:18:57,290
doesn't.
It sounds like a goof.

5351
04:18:57,290 --> 04:19:02,190
It does just sound.
You sound like a crackpot even worried 

5352
04:19:02,190 --> 04:19:02,340
about this issue.
It sounds completely ridiculous,

5353
04:19:02,490 --> 04:19:04,830
but that might be what's how it's 
sneaking in?

5354
04:19:05,220 --> 04:19:06,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

5355
04:19:06,690 --> 04:19:07,110
I mean,
it just,

5356
04:19:07,140 --> 04:19:12,140
it.
Just imagine that the tiny increment 

5357
04:19:12,140 --> 04:19:12,660
that would make suddenly make it 
compelling.

5358
04:19:12,810 --> 04:19:14,010
I mean,
just imagine,

5359
04:19:14,850 --> 04:19:19,850
I mean chest doesn't do it because chess
is so far from any central human 

5360
04:19:19,850 --> 04:19:20,310
concern.
But just imagine if your,

5361
04:19:20,400 --> 04:19:25,400
if your phone recognized your emotional 
state better than any than your best 

5362
04:19:26,521 --> 04:19:30,480
friend or your wife or anyone in your 
life and then did it reliably.

5363
04:19:31,200 --> 04:19:31,980
Right?
So as your body,

5364
04:19:31,981 --> 04:19:36,981
like that movie with Joaquin for her,
he falls in love with his phone.

5365
04:19:37,051 --> 04:19:38,190
Right?
I mean,

5366
04:19:38,191 --> 04:19:39,270
that's just not,
you know,

5367
04:19:40,170 --> 04:19:42,960
that is not far off that far off.
It's not,

5368
04:19:42,961 --> 04:19:44,760
it's a very discreet ability.
I mean,

5369
04:19:44,761 --> 04:19:46,680
you could do that.
You could do that without any,

5370
04:19:47,430 --> 04:19:49,160
any other ability.
And the phone really.

5371
04:19:49,161 --> 04:19:49,920
It's like,
it doesn't,

5372
04:19:49,921 --> 04:19:52,660
it doesn't have to to,
uh,

5373
04:19:52,740 --> 04:19:56,730
stand on the shoulders of any other kind
of intelligence.

5374
04:19:56,731 --> 04:19:57,510
It could just,
you know,

5375
04:19:58,020 --> 04:19:59,790
you have.
This could be,

5376
04:20:00,060 --> 04:20:05,060
you could do this with just brute force 
in the same way that you have a great 

5377
04:20:05,060 --> 04:20:06,210
chess player that doesn't necessarily 
understand that it's playing chess.

5378
04:20:06,930 --> 04:20:11,930
You could have some facial recognition,
facial recognition of emotion and the 

5379
04:20:11,930 --> 04:20:16,580
and the tone of voice,
recognition of emotion and the idea that

5380
04:20:18,691 --> 04:20:23,691
it's gonna.
It's gonna be a very long time for 

5381
04:20:23,691 --> 04:20:25,641
computers.
They get better than people at that I 

5382
04:20:25,641 --> 04:20:25,641
think is is very far fetched.

5383
04:20:25,641 --> 04:20:25,750
I was thinking.
Yeah,

5384
04:20:25,751 --> 04:20:27,220
I think you're right.
I was just thinking,

5385
04:20:27,221 --> 04:20:32,221
how strange would it be if you had 
headphones on and your phone's in your 

5386
04:20:32,221 --> 04:20:33,850
pocket and you have rational 
conversations with your phone,

5387
04:20:33,970 --> 04:20:36,610
like your phone knew you better than you
know you like.

5388
04:20:36,611 --> 04:20:37,630
I mean,
I don't know what to do.

5389
04:20:37,631 --> 04:20:39,280
I mean,
I don't think I was out of line.

5390
04:20:39,281 --> 04:20:40,300
She yelled at me.
I mean,

5391
04:20:40,301 --> 04:20:45,301
what should I say and I would have 
listened to every one of your 

5392
04:20:45,301 --> 04:20:45,301
conversations with your friends.
Exactly.

5393
04:20:45,301 --> 04:20:45,880
Train up on that.
Just talk to you about it and go,

5394
04:20:45,881 --> 04:20:47,260
listen man,
this is what you gotta do.

5395
04:20:48,310 --> 04:20:51,190
Your sounding angry.
You got defensive.

5396
04:20:51,220 --> 04:20:54,310
He got defensive.
I apologize.

5397
04:20:54,340 --> 04:20:55,900
Relax.
Let's all move on.

5398
04:20:56,070 --> 04:20:57,490
If you could accelerate it.
Are you okay?

5399
04:20:57,491 --> 04:20:58,480
You right man.
Right man.

5400
04:20:58,630 --> 04:21:00,190
And like you're talking to this little 
artificial.

5401
04:21:00,191 --> 04:21:02,620
Maybe that's the first version of 
artificial intelligence.

5402
04:21:02,621 --> 04:21:04,200
Uh,
we suggest we go.

5403
04:21:04,240 --> 04:21:06,250
All right.
Let's give it a and like self help guys

5404
04:21:06,250 --> 04:21:09,070
in your phone of like a personal trainer
in your phone.

5405
04:21:09,100 --> 04:21:12,400
How to talk to girls and it's probably 
slow down.

5406
04:21:12,730 --> 04:21:14,980
Slow down.
You're talking too fast,

5407
04:21:15,390 --> 04:21:16,720
Kinda cool.
Yeah,

5408
04:21:16,820 --> 04:21:21,820
that would,
I mean literally like giving you 

5409
04:21:21,820 --> 04:21:21,820
information.
They'll be like step one.

5410
04:21:21,820 --> 04:21:23,380
That'd be like the Sony Walkman.
Remember when you had a Walkman,

5411
04:21:23,381 --> 04:21:27,310
like a cassette player that was like a 
VCR.

5412
04:21:27,311 --> 04:21:31,930
I know when we were on our way to what 
we have today where you have 30,000

5413
04:21:31,931 --> 04:21:35,200
songs in your phone or something.
I think I remember the first Walkman.

5414
04:21:35,201 --> 04:21:38,050
The first thing I just want to,
back when I skied,

5415
04:21:38,051 --> 04:21:40,600
there was something called,
it was called astral tunes or something.

5416
04:21:40,601 --> 04:21:45,601
It was like,
it was like a car radio that you could 

5417
04:21:45,601 --> 04:21:46,430
just put in a pack on your chest.
Um,

5418
04:21:47,410 --> 04:21:52,410
yeah it was.
They kept coming out with those sounds 

5419
04:21:52,410 --> 04:21:52,410
they would get smaller and smaller,
so then that little,

5420
04:21:52,410 --> 04:21:53,350
the little dude would start telling you,
Yo,

5421
04:21:53,351 --> 04:21:53,890
man,
dude,

5422
04:21:53,891 --> 04:21:55,960
listen to keep replace me every year.

5423
04:21:56,140 --> 04:22:01,140
Just let them stick me in.
Your brain will be together all the 

5424
04:22:01,140 --> 04:22:03,541
time.
I've been given you good advice for 

5425
04:22:03,541 --> 04:22:03,541
years,
Bro.

5426
04:22:03,730 --> 04:22:08,730
Let me in your brain,
and so you and this little artificial 

5427
04:22:08,730 --> 04:22:09,550
intelligence has you have a relationship
over time.

5428
04:22:09,920 --> 04:22:13,750
Eventually it talks you into getting 
your head drilled and screw it in there,

5429
04:22:14,180 --> 04:22:19,180
and your artificial intelligence has 
always powered by your central nervous 

5430
04:22:19,180 --> 04:22:20,020
system.
Have you seen most of these movies?

5431
04:22:20,021 --> 04:22:21,830
Like did you see her and.
No,

5432
04:22:21,850 --> 04:22:26,850
I didn't know.
And that was one of my top 10 all time 

5433
04:22:28,181 --> 04:22:29,010
favorite movies.
Yeah,

5434
04:22:29,080 --> 04:22:30,580
I love that movie.
Actually.

5435
04:22:30,581 --> 04:22:32,110
I like it.
I saw it twice.

5436
04:22:32,111 --> 04:22:32,680
I said I,
I,

5437
04:22:32,840 --> 04:22:37,840
I was slow to realize how well they did 
it.

5438
04:22:38,310 --> 04:22:40,510
I mean,
it was just the first time I saw it,

5439
04:22:40,511 --> 04:22:45,280
I thought I wasn't as impressed and I 
watched it again and they really,

5440
04:22:45,790 --> 04:22:47,480
first of all the performance of,
of um,

5441
04:22:48,580 --> 04:22:51,060
I forgot the actress's name.
Uh,

5442
04:22:51,660 --> 04:22:56,450
the candor candor is that with the woman
who plays the robot in x,

5443
04:22:56,470 --> 04:22:59,950
Makkah is just fantastic,
but I'm scary.

5444
04:22:59,951 --> 04:23:01,660
Good.
Tuck you in anything.

5445
04:23:01,780 --> 04:23:03,840
We're getting a little full on time.
Yeah,

5446
04:23:03,850 --> 04:23:05,830
what do we like five hours and a half 
hours in?

5447
04:23:05,831 --> 04:23:07,840
But I just got a note about this,
about the Philip.

5448
04:23:07,900 --> 04:23:12,900
Wait a minute.
How many hours for a half hour 

5449
04:23:12,900 --> 04:23:12,900
computer's about to fill up.
We did.

5450
04:23:12,900 --> 04:23:15,890
We just did a four and a half hour.
We were ready to keep going to Jesus.

5451
04:23:15,960 --> 04:23:16,490
I,
Jamie,

5452
04:23:16,520 --> 04:23:19,810
didn't,
you know what man,

5453
04:23:19,811 --> 04:23:24,811
once you opened up that box up Pandora's
box of shit and I've looked up,

5454
04:23:26,050 --> 04:23:29,350
is there any sort of concept of autism 
and ai,

5455
04:23:29,380 --> 04:23:31,660
like a spectrum of Ai,
like Oh,

5456
04:23:31,661 --> 04:23:33,900
there are dumb ai and there's going to 
be smart Ai.

5457
04:23:34,220 --> 04:23:34,490
Yeah,
yeah,

5458
04:23:34,491 --> 04:23:35,140
yeah,
I know.

5459
04:23:35,180 --> 04:23:36,950
So,
I mean the scary thing.

5460
04:23:36,951 --> 04:23:38,960
So yeah,
it's like super autism.

5461
04:23:39,500 --> 04:23:40,890
There's no,
um,

5462
04:23:42,300 --> 04:23:47,300
across the board there's,
I think that super intelligence and 

5463
04:23:47,300 --> 04:23:49,990
motivation and goals are totally 
separable.

5464
04:23:50,000 --> 04:23:55,000
So you could have a super intelligent 
machine that is purposed toward a goal 

5465
04:23:55,641 --> 04:24:00,170
that just seems completely absurd and 
harmful and non common sensical.

5466
04:24:00,171 --> 04:24:05,171
And they said they,
the example that Nick Bostrom uses in 

5467
04:24:05,171 --> 04:24:05,330
book superintelligence,
which was a great book,

5468
04:24:06,090 --> 04:24:11,090
um,
and did more to inform my thinking on 

5469
04:24:11,090 --> 04:24:13,271
this topic than any other source.
He talks about a paperclip maximizer.

5470
04:24:13,360 --> 04:24:18,360
You could,
you could build a super intelligent 

5471
04:24:18,360 --> 04:24:18,360
paperclip maximizer.
Now,

5472
04:24:18,360 --> 04:24:21,401
not that anyone would do this,
but the point is you could build a 

5473
04:24:21,401 --> 04:24:25,271
machine that was,
that was smarter than we are in every 

5474
04:24:25,271 --> 04:24:28,841
conceivable way,
but all it wants to do is produce 

5475
04:24:28,841 --> 04:24:28,841
paperclips.
Right now that seems counterintuitive,

5476
04:24:28,841 --> 04:24:33,521
but there's no,
there's no reason when you dig deeply 

5477
04:24:33,521 --> 04:24:35,660
into this,
there's no reason why you couldn't build

5478
04:24:35,661 --> 04:24:39,460
a superhuman paperclip maximizer just 
wants to turn everything,

5479
04:24:39,470 --> 04:24:44,470
you know,
just like literally the atoms in your 

5480
04:24:44,470 --> 04:24:44,470
body would be better used as paperclips.

5481
04:24:44,470 --> 04:24:46,170
Um,
and so this is just a,

5482
04:24:46,220 --> 04:24:51,220
the point he's making is that 
superintelligence could be very 

5483
04:24:51,220 --> 04:24:54,851
counterintuitive.
It's not necessarily going to inherit 

5484
04:24:54,851 --> 04:24:55,580
everything we find,
as you know,

5485
04:24:55,620 --> 04:25:00,620
common sensical or,
or emotionally appropriate or wise or 

5486
04:25:00,620 --> 04:25:03,530
desirable.
It could be totally foreign,

5487
04:25:03,980 --> 04:25:07,170
totally trivial in some way,
you know,

5488
04:25:07,580 --> 04:25:11,180
focused on something that means nothing 
to us but means everything to it because

5489
04:25:11,181 --> 04:25:16,181
of some cork and how it's motivation 
system is structured and yet it can 

5490
04:25:16,970 --> 04:25:21,260
build the perfect nanotechnology that 
will allow it to build more paperclips.

5491
04:25:21,380 --> 04:25:22,130
Right?
So,

5492
04:25:22,680 --> 04:25:24,650
um,
and Lisa,

5493
04:25:24,651 --> 04:25:27,980
at least I don't think anyone can see 
why that's ruled out in advance.

5494
04:25:27,981 --> 04:25:32,981
I mean,
there's no reason why we would 

5495
04:25:32,981 --> 04:25:34,220
intentionally build that,
but the fear is we might build something

5496
04:25:35,060 --> 04:25:40,060
that either is not perfectly aligned 
with our goals and our common sense and 

5497
04:25:42,861 --> 04:25:43,700
our,
and our,

5498
04:25:43,701 --> 04:25:48,701
um,
aspirations and that it could form some 

5499
04:25:48,701 --> 04:25:52,870
kind of separate instrumental goals to 
get what he wants he wants that are 

5500
04:25:52,870 --> 04:25:55,430
totally incompatible with life as we 
know it.

5501
04:25:55,430 --> 04:25:57,200
And that's,
you know,

5502
04:25:57,510 --> 04:25:58,200
again,
the,

5503
04:25:58,310 --> 04:26:00,320
the examples of this are always 
cartoonish.

5504
04:26:00,321 --> 04:26:01,030
Like,
you know how I mean,

5505
04:26:01,050 --> 04:26:02,180
Elon Musk said,
you know,

5506
04:26:02,181 --> 04:26:05,270
if you built up super intelligent 
machine and he told it to reduce spam,

5507
04:26:05,750 --> 04:26:08,840
well then it could just kill all people 
as a great way to reduce spam,

5508
04:26:08,841 --> 04:26:09,670
right?
Um,

5509
04:26:10,070 --> 04:26:13,010
but see the reason why that's law,
if it's laughable,

5510
04:26:13,011 --> 04:26:18,011
but you,
you can't assume the common sense won't 

5511
04:26:18,011 --> 04:26:18,080
be there unless we've built it,
right?

5512
04:26:18,081 --> 04:26:23,081
Like,
you have to have anticipated all of 

5513
04:26:23,081 --> 04:26:23,081
this.
You can't,

5514
04:26:23,081 --> 04:26:23,081
if you say take me to the airport as 
fast as you can.

5515
04:26:23,120 --> 04:26:24,140
Again,
this is Bostrom,

5516
04:26:24,490 --> 04:26:29,490
you know,
and you have a super intelligent 

5517
04:26:29,490 --> 04:26:29,490
automatic car.
Um,

5518
04:26:29,690 --> 04:26:31,010
you know,
a self driving car,

5519
04:26:31,011 --> 04:26:36,011
you'll just,
you'll get to the airport covered in 

5520
04:26:36,011 --> 04:26:37,781
vomit because it'll just,
it's just going to go as fast as it can 

5521
04:26:37,781 --> 04:26:37,781
go.
Um,

5522
04:26:37,910 --> 04:26:42,910
so it's a,
it's our intuitions about what it would 

5523
04:26:42,910 --> 04:26:45,260
mean to be super intelligent necessarily
are,

5524
04:26:45,320 --> 04:26:45,970
are.
Um,

5525
04:26:47,060 --> 04:26:52,060
I mean there's no,
we have to correct for them because I 

5526
04:26:52,060 --> 04:26:54,401
think our intuitions are bad.
You're freaking me out and you've been 

5527
04:26:54,401 --> 04:26:55,510
freaking me out for over an hour and a 
half.

5528
04:26:55,530 --> 04:26:58,530
Freaked out that we did four and half 
hours and I thought that's ridiculous.

5529
04:26:58,531 --> 04:27:00,710
We're coming up on three,
man.

5530
04:27:00,711 --> 04:27:02,250
I hope wrong about all that stuff.

5531
04:27:02,820 --> 04:27:05,760
Maybe so it doesn't.
It doesn't seem that.

5532
04:27:06,120 --> 04:27:07,560
I don't know.
It doesn't look that Rosie.

5533
04:27:07,561 --> 04:27:09,150
Jamie,
I'm sorry.

5534
04:27:09,160 --> 04:27:10,310
I'm sorry.
To be such a buzzkill.

5535
04:27:10,330 --> 04:27:13,380
Look to the woods.
Might have to figure out how to live off

5536
04:27:13,381 --> 04:27:17,540
the land.
You're the ultimate prepper.

5537
04:27:17,670 --> 04:27:18,800
No,
it ain't easy,

5538
04:27:18,940 --> 04:27:21,660
man.
Fucking I'm bad at it.

5539
04:27:21,661 --> 04:27:24,060
I'll starve wellstar.
I won't be a vegetarian.

5540
04:27:24,061 --> 04:27:27,540
I'll come to your house for bear meat 
and it might get ugly.

5541
04:27:27,541 --> 04:27:29,280
Folks,
let's hope Sam Harris wrong.

5542
04:27:29,281 --> 04:27:30,390
Thank you brother.
Appreciate it.

5543
04:27:30,391 --> 04:27:32,630
And your podcast.
Tell people how to get us.

5544
04:27:32,670 --> 04:27:36,180
Waking Up is my podcast and you can find
it on my website,

5545
04:27:36,181 --> 04:27:37,140
Sam Harris,
dot org,

5546
04:27:37,590 --> 04:27:39,390
or on itunes.
You can get his book,

5547
04:27:39,420 --> 04:27:41,520
one of his books if you go to 
audible.com,

5548
04:27:41,521 --> 04:27:42,960
forward slash Joe,
right?

5549
04:27:42,990 --> 04:27:45,470
Isn't that get one?
Go get one of those folks.

5550
04:27:45,690 --> 04:27:47,280
All right,
thank you ladies and gentlemen.

5551
04:27:47,310 --> 04:27:48,650
Thank you Sam.
That was awesome.

5552
04:27:48,680 --> 04:27:48,990
Thank you bro.
