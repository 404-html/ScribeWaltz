1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,610
Trey,

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,081
my day,

3
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:04,840
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day is,

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,660
I think I remember you're
seeing short careers anyways.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,130
Yeah.

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,851
Like to me this,

7
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:11,310
this and I feel the same
way as you guys do with,

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,300
it's sad the way Rhonda lost what's not
that sad because she had such a great

9
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:15,720
run.

10
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,553
She was a pioneer.

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,710
She was on the Mount
Rushmore of MMA in general.

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,700
She goes on Mount restaurant.

13
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,170
It's really not that sad.

14
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:23,190
Like God damn,

15
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,960
what are iconic run man.

16
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,920
Sad is like you've got like more
coalminer or a guy like if Mark Hunt word

17
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,641
retire like that.

18
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,500
Sad people don't have money and fame.

19
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,640
She set man.

20
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,780
It's not that sad.

21
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,400
She did some great shit.

22
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,234
A great things.

23
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,070
You know what's interesting
here is going on,

24
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,660
it's like the Ronda fans,

25
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,440
um,

26
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,870
they're not MMA fans.

27
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:43,650
A lot of them,

28
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,550
they're Ronda fans and so like you see
how they respond to stuff on Twitter and

29
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:50,280
you see like the reaction of
the things that they're saying.

30
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,720
Like it's pretty emotional.

31
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,740
It's very emotional.

32
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,170
It's also almost like
they don't understand.

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,610
They don't understand the sport.

34
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,180
You know,

35
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,070
get back on the horse.

36
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,231
Like,

37
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:58,381
Whoa,

38
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:58,531
Whoa,

39
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:58,681
Whoa,

40
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:58,831
Whoa,

41
00:00:58,831 --> 00:00:59,071
Whoa,

42
00:00:59,071 --> 00:00:59,904
fuck the horse.

43
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:00,631
No,

44
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:01,464
listen to your mom,

45
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,010
your mom,

46
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,120
your mom saying stop.

47
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,020
Her mom's brilliant.

48
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,441
Yeah,

49
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,040
her mom's,

50
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,873
her mom's brutal.

51
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,781
She so brutal.

52
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:07,500
She says,

53
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:07,951
she goes,

54
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,960
go let stupid people
get punched in the face.

55
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,231
Sorry.

56
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:10,970
Stupid people.

57
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,130
Her,

58
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,520
her mom,

59
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,630
her mom's brilliant and she's a doctor
and the good thing for Rhonda to add all

60
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,180
of this is she's going to
find out who's in her corner.

61
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,700
There's been,

62
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,321
there's been so many.

63
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:19,800
Yes men.

64
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,700
You know how it is in Holland.

65
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,020
There's nothing when you're on set,

66
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:24,210
you know bullshit is your agents.

67
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,700
These other people you're working
with these other celebrities,

68
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:26,911
Tony,

69
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,680
all good Ui.

70
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,300
Well now when you lose that,

71
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,440
that phone stops ringing
and the tech stop coming.

72
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,160
Everyone asks you to Denver.

73
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,010
That stuff you're going to
find out who's in your corner.

74
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,880
That's probably,

75
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,020
they might be good for now.

76
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:37,854
Let me ask you,

77
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,300
do the last two years,

78
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,080
because I heard they cut a one
and the other one disappeared.

79
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,191
Who knows?

80
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:45,450
Who knows what kind of deal she has,

81
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:48,870
but things definitely dried
up substantially after
the Holly knockout because

82
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,160
she's not the same person anymore.

83
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,660
The thing about all those deals is when
you're a winner in Hollywood and they

84
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:58,440
start throwing all these movies at you
and you're some athletes coming over,

85
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,590
it's all predicated on you being
that person that they're selling,

86
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:02,040
right?

87
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,701
What are they selling?

88
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,130
They're selling this
undefeated women's ass kicker.

89
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,701
The likes,

90
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:06,600
if you've never seen before,

91
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,050
right?

92
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,070
Throwing people in their head,

93
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:08,910
get him in an arm bar.

94
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,840
That's what they're selling.

95
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,471
Well,

96
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,580
that's not you anymore.

97
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,110
Now you just got smashed by Holly and
then smashed again by a man and they can't

98
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:20,000
sell your acting abilities to,

99
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,280
she'd be waiting to,

100
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,500
she'd do roadhouse.

101
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,500
Did she redo roadhouse done?

102
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,191
They killed.

103
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,380
I don't know about any of that stuff.

104
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:27,470
I,

105
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,400
I just know to,

106
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:30,160
to his point where they're,

107
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:30,940
it's,

108
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,700
it's almost a good thing for it.

109
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,451
It really is,

110
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:33,750
man.

111
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,830
It's not a sad story.

112
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:36,210
I don't find it as a sad story.

113
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,230
I really don't.

114
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,441
Well,

115
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,060
it's definitely sad and she was an angel.

116
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,240
It's not the sadness.

117
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,220
When she disappeared,

118
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,054
Bro,

119
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:42,961
she came,

120
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:43,160
goes,

121
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,580
she leaves it all that much different.

122
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,390
Do we feel safe for tiger woods like that?

123
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,801
Like I said,

124
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:47,940
when that foundation rocks,

125
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,040
like what do you think's
different with Tiger's swing?

126
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,601
No,

127
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:51,434
the difference.

128
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,390
You can get the fuck beat
out of them and 48 seconds.

129
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,470
I know and that's fighting,

130
00:02:55,471 --> 00:03:00,471
but what I'm saying is there
hadn't mentality changes
when tiger on stoppable he

131
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,360
something happened.

132
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,170
He's had that.

133
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,520
He had the the scandal.

134
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:03,790
Yes,

135
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,190
but then he also has some
significant back injuries.

136
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,641
Correct.

137
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,100
Or what our K for better
example to your fight example.

138
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,993
Mike Tyson.

139
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,541
Yeah.

140
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,980
That's also wear and tear too,

141
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,823
man.

142
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,291
Yeah.

143
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:17,080
You can say that for Rhonda
tickets waiting to tell you why.

144
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:17,531
I can say that.

145
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,620
One of the reasons why is because the
driver that I had this weekend in Vegas

146
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,610
that took me to the airport was
Mike Tyson's driver for 17 years.

147
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,500
I had a long conversation.

148
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,311
Cool Dude.

149
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,050
I wish I could remember his fucking name.

150
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,660
I only met him for that brief
brief ride to the airport,

151
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,930
but he was telling me how fucked up
Tyson was after the Lennox Lewis fight.

152
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,711
He's like,

153
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:35,921
dude,

154
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:39,960
Lennox Lewis hit Mike and Mike was
fucked up for a long time for shit.

155
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
And you don't think that you
watch a guy get knocked out,

156
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,480
you watch guy get stopped.

157
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,051
And you know,

158
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,000
Mike was talking after
the fight and he was like,

159
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,301
Hey,

160
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:46,820
you know I'm,

161
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,501
I'm done.

162
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,420
It's over and eaten a step back.

163
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,260
But when he goes home and he's alone
and the cameras are off and he's got

164
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,930
vertigo and he's got equilibrium problems
and his ears won't stop ringing in his

165
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,241
head,

166
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,380
won't stop throbbing.

167
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,630
You don't see that he's doing interviews.

168
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:06,610
His head's throb and his ears are ringing.

169
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:07,780
There was no internet back then.

170
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:08,260
It's harder.

171
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,210
It's harder to hide nowadays.

172
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:10,900
You know what I mean?

173
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,170
Hard.

174
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,120
You've got your daily thing
that you do and everybody,

175
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,760
you got your followers and they all know
your daily thing and you guys are doing

176
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:16,720
the daily things.

177
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,470
All of a sudden he disappeared.

178
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,350
Everybody knows he
disappeared and back then,

179
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,790
no one really knew you lost the fight.

180
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,220
You never really see him again.

181
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,580
Like when he was also like,

182
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,080
when you're suffering alone,

183
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:28,660
the only way people find
out is if you talk about it.

184
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,080
Like we don't know what happens to a lot
of these guys after they get beat the

185
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,914
fuck up.

186
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,530
[inaudible].
