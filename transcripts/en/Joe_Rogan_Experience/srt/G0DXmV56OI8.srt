00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,940
Hello Freak bitches.
I think we will become incredibly

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:09,180
annoying spammers of ourselves.
That's what we're going to do.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,710
We're going to be able to download
ourselves.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,980
Then we're just going to fucking shoot
ourselves in the bit torrent and mega

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,140
upload.
We're going to put ourselves everywhere.

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,940
Like I want to go everywhere.
I want to go to fucking Europe,

7
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:21,030
I want to be in Turkey and there'd be
doubles and triples of people all

8
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:25,030
throughout the the this,
this artificial world that we've created

9
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,690
of hyperspace.
We're going to have like a hyper space

10
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:32,691
cloud drive of humanity that's going to
be just as fucking crowded as earth and

11
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:35,880
we're going to go shit,
we don't have enough hard drive space

12
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:40,460
and the fucking cloud and these assholes
keep copying themselves cause they want

13
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:43,050
to be a mortal.
So like rich guys would have like a

14
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:47,880
cloud serve reflect 200 trillion
terabytes and it would just be filled

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,660
with copies of themselves and then they
would just send out fucking like fake

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,400
emails.
Click here to see some Dick.

17
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,570
Whoa,
I want to see some Dick.

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,970
And you click that,
boom.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,180
He,
it's an exploit.

20
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,830
It gets into your server.
Bang.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,140
Makes copies of himself everywhere.

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,340
Yeah.
You'll be able to like get Joe Rogan in

23
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,180
your cars.
Your car has your brain in all your,

24
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:10,270
your past and all your memories,
but your cars talking to you and it's

25
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:11,790
due.
It's like you're my bro.

26
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,810
Imagine if they figure out a way to not
just download your consciousness but

27
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,140
take parts out you don't need.
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,960
Like take parts out that you don't need,
like your ego.

29
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,040
Take the ego out and have,
have this consciousness be completely

30
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,020
compliant.
We figured out a way to isolate the ego.

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,970
We're going to remove it and we're going
to put this brain in cars so he get in

32
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:40,570
your car and you're talking to you,
but you don't have your own ego.

33
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:41,290
We go,
hey man,

34
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,860
I fucking,
I want to have a say or where we drive.

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,530
You can't have that shit coming out of
your car like your car has to be

36
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,090
completely compliant.
Right.

37
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,500
That's how I drive.
I don't,

38
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:54,010
I don't take advice from my fucking car.
I'm driving bitch relaxed.

39
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,530
But if you could download your
consciousness,

40
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:00,310
your own conscious in your car,
your car would be literally an extension

41
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,110
of you.
And the car thinks it's you.

42
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:02,890
Yeah,
it's card.

43
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,780
Totally thinks it's you.
I can't see.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,470
Well the card,
the card knows that you and it or one.

45
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,840
And then when you're together you're the
same.

46
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,170
But his,
his legs place in life is to be your

47
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:14,610
car.

48
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,010
It's so fucked up.
And you can start downloading you and

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,600
everything so you could download you in
the toilet microwave.

50
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:22,900
You just have little Joe Rogan.
Like who thinks it's a real person?

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,190
Yeah,
we'll get invaded.

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
You would get like,
someone would break your door to obtain

53
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,710
Dong.
You open the door a million bill burrs

54
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,920
compiling your house.
There's someone decided to just copy

55
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:37,390
bill burr and put all the bill birth
files out into the Internet.

56
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,080
You have to kill them all because you
don't want to a bunch of bill burrs

57
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,460
talking all day.
So you have to be like,

58
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,450
I'm sorry,
Bill Byrd,

59
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,930
toaster.
Well going to kill you.

60
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,300
And they would be like,
wolves.

61
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:46,880
They're really

62
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,620
cool.
But you have to control the numbers.

63
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,450
You know
that many of any of us,

64
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,690
imagine if there's 100 million Jamie
vernors you would go listen dude enough,

65
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,700
it's too many of you fuckers.
If people don't think about that shit

66
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,530
man,
if it's possible to download

67
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,760
consciousness is possible to copy it.
If it's possible to copy it,

68
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,790
it's possible.
Spam it.

69
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,660
In that sense,
your history is really kind of fucked up

70
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,090
and weird when you,
if you approach it with them through a

71
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:20,320
moral lens because you see so many nasty
seeing steck place and in the weird ones

72
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:23,290
are the ones where there really is no
good solution where you don't know what

73
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,500
the healthy thing would be like.
There's one that I was researching flora

74
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,470
and he's three on fire maybe a year from
now or something.

75
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:33,580
I was he searching the story from the
1980 [inaudible] in El Salvador.

76
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,230
At that time there was a right wing
government in El Salvador.

77
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,280
De was government was supporting and
there was a leftist Galleria.

78
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:43,600
There was in the logic of the Cold War,
there are only two options.

79
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,850
You're read pro communist story.
Our [inaudible].

80
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,200
There's nothing in between,
right?

81
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,460
So in the process of fighting is left is
gonorrhea.

82
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,900
The government of El Salvador is doing
nasty sayings,

83
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,600
right?
Anybody will criticize them,

84
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,350
doesn't matter whether they are
communist or not.

85
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,930
Get tortured to death,
chop off their bodies.

86
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,430
We'll leave them in the middle of the
street.

87
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,620
American Congress at that point,
cause I go,

88
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,560
shit,
you know it can't really keep sending

89
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,740
millions of dollars to,
these guys were doing horrible human

90
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,730
rights violations.
So they passed these low that in order

91
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:15,790
for any more aid to be sent to the
governor of El Salvador,

92
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,660
the president of the United States,
to sign off on a document stating that

93
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,990
these guys have made huge improvements
in their human rights record,

94
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,430
that they're on the right path.

95
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,630
You know it's getting better.
Problem is the deadline is coming up

96
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,700
that Reagan is each into be able to send
out all these millions of dollars to do

97
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:36,490
the government of El Salvador.
And in the moment a Salvadorian army

98
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,470
cous on these offensive against the
Galleria.

99
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,750
They find some villages that chest
wanted to be left the fuck alone.

100
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,500
They were not pro communist,
but they are not anticommunist either.

101
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,650
They were like bunch of Evangelical
Christianity peasants who just wanted to

102
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,570
farm their fields and be left alone.
So he,

103
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,130
they would lead the communist,
go through,

104
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,660
they will add the army,
go through a figure.

105
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,180
If we stay neutral,
everything works out right.

106
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,280
While not in the core door and the Cold
War,

107
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,830
there is no neutrality are either on one
side or the other.

108
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:06,910
So Salvadorian army come in and grab
every single villagers,

109
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,570
separate demand from the women keelhaul
demand or April.

110
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,570
The women don't kill them all,
kill everybody in that village and New

111
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,770
York Times.
The New York Times did an article on it

112
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,520
and um,
and uh,

113
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:20,680
Reagan was like,
Oh shit,

114
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,060
what do I do now?
So he said,

115
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,030
the guy who wrote this article is some
crazy communists.

116
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,430
None of these is through.
It's a smear campaign against our

117
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,950
allies.
The government of El Salvador has made

118
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,160
huge improvements.
I'm sending the millions of dollars of

119
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:34,770
course,
years down the road or south of the

120
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,240
original story.
It was through that the staff did that

121
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:41,120
pen and but other than bitching about
Reagan,

122
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,460
this is not even an anti Reagan thing is
that it's a messy situation because you

123
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,460
do support the government of El
Salvador.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,590
He are literally supporting death
squads,

125
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,380
child rapists.
I mean it doesn't really get any worse

126
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:56,080
than that.
You don't support them.

127
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,410
There's a chance that so hard when the
recruiter turn into a communist state,

128
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:04,080
in which case he's not exactly what
communism around the world as a high

129
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,450
reputation for human rights.

130
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,710
It's fucking awful.
Right.

131
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,780
So he's like,
what do you choose?

132
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,850
You know the,
you choose to support them or do you

133
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:13,760
choose?
It's like how do you see where I'm

134
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:15,800
going?
Like it's a situation where no matter

135
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,850
what you choose,
you're fucked.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're doing bad things.
But clearly the moment you're supporting

137
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,220
that squads,
that cannot be the right solution.

138
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,020
Not that,
but at the same time,

139
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:30,170
what is the right solution?
What is there good thing you should do?

140
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,330
You know Carter at the same exact
proper,

141
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,450
you know right before Reagan Carter,
some guide yard,

142
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:37,010
she'd be shipped off El Salvador.
This guy,

143
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:38,870
Oscar Romero,
San Te maillet there,

144
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:42,170
saints top fucking sandy money to my
government because they are doing

145
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:45,020
horrible syncs with it cart.
I was like,

146
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,640
Eh,
I don't want to look at this because

147
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:51,641
this is politically traveling for me.
So two weeks later that's squats walking

148
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:55,220
into the main church in El Salvador.
This guy was celebrating mass.

149
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,020
They gunned him down,
kill them.

150
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,750
So it's not a Republican or democratic
thing,

151
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,760
you know it's like both sides of the
game.

152
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:06,260
They are did not know how to handle this
in a situation where it's like which

153
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,230
mass murders do we support and which
ones do we oppose?

154
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:13,980
Cause that's the reality of it.
It was like there are the stories or

155
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:14,560
like what?
What

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,210
the fuck do you do?
Yeah,

157
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:19,810
I would imagine and probably last a long
ass time too long time.

158
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,180
It's a long day at the beach.
It was probably a couple solid hours of

159
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:28,780
visions then right?
With that kind of dose.

160
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,920
Yeah.
On and off.

161
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,340
There were some,
yeah,

162
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,240
there.
I kept seeing initially I kept seeing a

163
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,360
like this,
like a group of people like Kinda

164
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,250
eyeball on us.
I was thinking like,

165
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,040
I think it is take our shit.
Like are they going to try to steal or

166
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,650
am I going to have to fight someone?
Like this doesn't,

167
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,030
this is weird and this is a place not a
lot of people go to.

168
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,850
And I kept seeing that and then I had to
take a deep breath,

169
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,360
like Tosca,
like feel me,

170
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:53,770
you know,
feel like my energy.

171
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:54,880
She could feel what's going on.
She's like,

172
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:56,470
are you okay?
I'm like,

173
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,820
ah,
somebody kind of come.

174
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,661
It's like,
no,

175
00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,780
what are you,
what are you talking about?

176
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,550
And she's like,
planes,

177
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,470
fucking sea turtle bugs and shit,
whatever.

178
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:03,304
You know,
like she's just,

179
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,570
she doesn't have it,
you know,

180
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:07,220
and she's looking over at me and am I
okay?

181
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,350
And she's like,
seriously,

182
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:09,700
you're fine,
don't worry,

183
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:10,391
you're fine.
I was like,

184
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:13,330
okay.
And I put my head back down and I kept

185
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:15,220
seeing it done.
Like this young kid kind of comes

186
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:17,800
through the crowd,
like he's going to challenge me and he

187
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:18,670
walks down.
I'm like,

188
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,890
Oh fuck,
I got to defend us.

189
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,570
I've got to fight and I know how fucked
up I am.

190
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,920
I can't believe we have to defend
myself.

191
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:27,310
And I'm like,
it's playing out in my mind all the ways

192
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:28,750
that I'm going to have to fight this
guy.

193
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,290
And I realized right then like I stand
up open.

194
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,081
My was like,
oh fuck,

195
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:33,310
it's just a vision.
And I was like,

196
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,380
Heart's racing.
I'm like,

197
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,890
why would I think that?
And then I realized every fucking day of

198
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:42,220
my life since I was a little kid,
I play that out.

199
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,040
Anytime someone gives me a dirty look or
says like we're from whatever being

200
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,750
picked on as a kid bully,
they can a shit.

201
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:51,730
Like I always play that out.
Like how am I going?

202
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,850
Am I going to have to fight this guy?
Am I going to have to fucking defend?

203
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,970
How's it gonna play out?
Oh,

204
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,460
he's,
he's got a long fucking neck.

205
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,830
I'm going to take us back and choke him
out.

206
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,191
Whatever.
You know what I'm saying?

207
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:04,410
But,
but it just showed me how silly this

208
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,430
dumb ass mind game that I would play and
I would go down the rabbit hole on a

209
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,990
fucking daily basis sometimes.

210
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,210
Like,
like just playing into this thought of

211
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:16,320
negativity that had no space for me.
And it doesn't mean no good to play that

212
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:16,630
out.
Like,

213
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,810
well that's fine cause then I'll do
this.

214
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,121
No,
no,

215
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:19,441
no,
no,

216
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:22,440
none of that shit.
I'm wasting time and becoming

217
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,410
emotionally attached to those thoughts.
It's not just,

218
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,820
Oh,
I'm thinking about this.

219
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,370
I'm feeling like I'm going to fight
right now.

220
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,730
That fucks you up.
That turns you into not your best

221
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:36,240
version of yourself.
So that vision from mushrooms was just a

222
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,870
fucking game changer.
It doesn't stop me from having those

223
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,810
thoughts,
but it allows me to catch myself.

224
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,680
I'm aware of it.

225
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,250
Okay.
