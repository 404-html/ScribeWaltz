1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,210
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,010
two,
one.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,480
Boom.
So what,

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,300
um,
hundred mile man or a hundred man,

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,160
what is it?
The 100 mile man.

6
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:14,250
What does that,
I ran a hundred mile race so years ago

7
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,960
and then say like,
I'm the fucking man,

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,880
let me,
let me grab it if it's available.

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,230
That's cool that you got it man.
Cause that's a very popular thing now.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,020
Yeah.
Did you run this before or after you did

11
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,900
the book with David Goggins?
I ran it before.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,741
Ah,
okay.

13
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:30,660
Yeah,
I think it's time when I did it.

14
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,980
They were like 400 Americans is,
they ran a hundred miles or something.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,660
It wasn't a lot.
So that's why it was available.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,730
Isn't it crazy how many people do it
now?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,680
Yeah,
I think I was trying to figure out in my

18
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:44,210
head how many do it a year and like how
many races?

19
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,640
A hundred mile races there are there a
month and then multiply it out.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,050
So probably five or 6,000 I'm guessing
five or 6,000 people who've done it?

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,150
I think probably.
I think so.

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,500
Wow.
Americans.

23
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,990
Yeah,
it's a long way.

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,860
It's a long fucking way.
We're just about talking right before

25
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,580
the podcast about how Miss America
yanked off,

26
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,940
uh,
all theirs.

27
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,280
They're no longer judge by their beauty.
And I post this because I thought it was

28
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:15,570
silly and there's just these fights
online,

29
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,060
man.
This fucking fights in the comments and

30
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:21,090
fights and people are tense.
Yeah.

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,430
People need to go out,
run those hundred miles.

32
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,530
But yeah,
they loosen up fast,

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,440
fast.
I don't,

34
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,270
what the fuck is going to miss?
America is scrapping the swimsuit

35
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,420
competition would no longer be judged on
physical appearance.

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,870
It's literally a beauty contest.
That is what it is.

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,960
What are they replacing it with?
I mean,

38
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:43,200
I got to think it's like when playboy
decided to not have people nude,

39
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,400
right?

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,140
That like the,
but here's the thing,

41
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,410
but no longer judging them on their
physical appearance.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,550
But what does that mean?
What does that mean?

43
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,030
Yeah,
that's a two way.

44
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,140
No longer a pageant.
Gretchen Carlson says

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,120
we're competition.
Okay.

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,230
I give up.
I don't know.

47
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:10,770
I think that might have bee a bee of
hurt the ratings a little bit.

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,670
I think a little bit or not.
Maybe people will get very excited about

49
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,840
it.
Maybe a little ramp up.

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,100
Yeah.
It's getting a lot of talk.

51
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,590
Yeah.
Maybe people will be pissed off and so

52
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:20,820
they'll tune in.
It's just,

53
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,590
I don't know.
Where do you stand on it?

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,660
I don't give a fuck.
It's so stupid.

55
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,010
Miss America.
I mean,

56
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,690
this is what's really fascinating to me
is that,

57
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,400
uh,
it was a read in the comments.

58
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:33,300
A lot of feminists were angry at me that
I was Maki and I saw a few of them.

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,480
I don't get it.
Like,

60
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:41,481
why would you even want a who I'd most
like to fuck contest because that's what

61
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:43,290
it is.
I mean,

62
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,960
that's really what it is.
You haven't these gals parade around or

63
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:47,550
bikini.
It's a beauty contest.

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,780
Do we have a Mister America contest?
Like is that just the president?

65
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,390
Is that what the Mr American context is?
I Dunno.

66
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,830
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

67
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,221
I mean,
I was,

68
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:00,700
I was trying to ask you as someone who's
deeply connected to competition

69
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,280
and mindsets,
yeah.

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,350
I don't know.
I'm not following it that closely,

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,090
but I am going to miss that part of the
competition even though really I just,

72
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,790
there's so many opportunities to see
people naked today.

73
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,361
They,
yeah.

74
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,550
But you know,
as a kid watching the met Miss America

75
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,660
pageant,
I was like,

76
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,000
you know,
they weren't allowed to options back

77
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,870
then.
Yeah.

78
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,840
Yeah.
Kids today are broken sports illustrated

79
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:26,200
and dust pageant swimsuit issue.
I wonder if they're gonna continue to

80
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,460
swimsuit issue.
Hmm.

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,120
Hmm.
Hmm.

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,490
Hmm.
Hmm.

83
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,400
Maybe the,
just see their faces and just have to

84
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:37,180
assume they're in this swimsuit and then
you know,

85
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,990
there'll be like a bubble,
a thought bubble and it will be filled

86
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:44,200
with an amazing quote that they say
that'd be the new swimsuit issue.

87
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,940
Cause we're just judging them on their
minds.

88
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,800
Right.
And the content.

89
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,910
Yes.
The content,

90
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,043
the content.

91
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,720
Speaking to content,
living with monks.

92
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,640
Yes.
What is it called?

93
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,620
Living with the monks.
Living with the monks.

94
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,420
Um,
does your new book?

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,940
Yes.
Why did you start to do that and how

96
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,670
long did you do it for?
I did it for 15 days.

97
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,440
I was enough.
That's more than enough,

98
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,600
man.
Yeah.

99
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,840
We're going to go like this for an hour.
Your finger all fall off dealing with

100
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:13,660
your finger up and down.
Just a repetition.

101
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,940
What did you have to do?
I uh,

102
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,160
well I live with,
there were,

103
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,740
there were eight monks for which had
been there for 50 years,

104
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,010
50 50 on a monastery,
800,

105
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,800
800,
500 acres kind of in the middle of

106
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,800
nowhere.
And um,

107
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,480
I went for 15 days.
So I figured,

108
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:31,960
you know,
I,

109
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,130
I'd invested so much of my life on the
physical side and ran a hundred miles

110
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:41,131
and just always active and this and that
and have really invested very little on

111
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,430
my own inner work.

112
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,200
And I just felt like,
man,

113
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,370
I just felt overwhelmed a little bit.
And I said to my wife,

114
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,800
you know,
who are the masters and everything

115
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,890
pointed to monks and I said,
I want to go live on a monastery.

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,600
There's something romantic about that,
right?

117
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,540
It's almost like the guy who goes off
into the woods to write a book.

118
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,670
I like being with a,
with a monk like and just being,

119
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,630
you know,
in a monastery with monks.

120
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,580
There's something very romantic about
that.

121
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,331
Right.
Does it,

122
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:12,331
you've shared all your worldly
belongings and you no longer care about

123
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,310
the day to day nonsense that everybody's
fixated on.

124
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,560
Just decide to just,
Oh,

125
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,570
[inaudible]

126
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,380
yes.
Oh,

127
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,300
all day.
You could do it.

128
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,360
I don't want to do it,
man.

129
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,050
You should want to do it.
I've lived the opposite of amongst life.

130
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,170
My life is filled with bullshit.
I get it.

131
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,820
Yeah.
Where'd you go?

132
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,880
So I went,
I went to a monastery just south of

133
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,570
Canada in the states.
Ah,

134
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,760
yeah.
But no,

135
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,010
what state is it?
It was in upstate New York.

136
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,610
Oh,
okay.

137
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,680
Yeah,
like on the Vermont border and it was

138
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,910
um,
you know,

139
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:52,880
no phone total kind of separation from
my family.

140
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,200
I have four kids,
my wife,

141
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,890
and just got to,
uh,

142
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,520
get to know myself little bit.
Wow.

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,430
Now when you were up there,
was there any time where you're like,

144
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:04,700
what the fuck am I doing?
Like one minute into it.

145
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,650
I got when I first got up there,
the main monk,

146
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:11,510
like my goto monk,
brother,

147
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,020
brother Christopher took me to my room.
They call the rooms a cell,

148
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,890
which is about the size of this table.
And I had a bed.

149
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,180
I walked in,
there was a bed,

150
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,080
there was a little desk with a night
lamp on it and nothing on the walls.

151
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,410
And he said,
tomorrow we're going to start prayer,

152
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,530
reflection and meditation at 7:15 AM and
I looked at my watch and it was 6:00 PM

153
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,330
and I asked him,
well,

154
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:40,331
what do we do between now and 7:15 AM?
And he looked at me dead in the eye and

155
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,650
he said,
you think?

156
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,400
And I said to myself,
I'm fucked.

157
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Because I'm like,
I don't really like spend a lot of time

158
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,510
in thought.
So I went and I said,

159
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,080
okay,
I'm going to,

160
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,980
I'm going to meditate.

161
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,300
You know,
like I'm here.

162
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,250
Let me start this journey with
meditation.

163
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:04,190
I'd taken a little a course in
transcendental meditation.

164
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,190
I'm not a big meditation guy other than
running.

165
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,550
And so I set my timer for 20 minutes and
I sat down in my chair and I started

166
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,240
like focusing on my mantra.
Like immediately I'm bombarded with how

167
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,860
is my wife,
how the kids,

168
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:19,920
the hawks,
all this,

169
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,070
you know,
the Atlanta Hawks.

170
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,360
I look at the ladder like,
you know,

171
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,650
and not,
you're kind of hawk,

172
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,350
everything's coming at me.
And um,

173
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,540
you know,
time is going by and I'm just getting

174
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,680
bombarded with thought and I'm like,
why isn't my timer buzz like it's been,

175
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:36,620
I've been here forever.
So I was going to look and reset my

176
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,910
thing and I'm like,
that would be cheating.

177
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:40,220
Let me keep going and going.
And all the time's going by.

178
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,770
And finally I'm like,
fuck is going on with my time or you

179
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:45,050
know.
So I opened my eyes and I looked to

180
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,900
reset my timer.
It's three minutes and 27 seconds.

181
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,760
No,
and I said to my,

182
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,210
I like really thought it was 20 minutes.
I thought it was like hours,

183
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:56,000
man.
I mean like I'd never really sat in a

184
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:01,001
room like with nothing going on and just
closed my eyes alone and thought and

185
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:05,090
time to stop.
And I calculated how much time I have

186
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,740
left,
like 15 days times,

187
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,120
24 hours,
a 60 minutes.

188
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,860
And I said to myself like,
man,

189
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:12,110
I'm in trouble.
This isn't like,

190
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,500
like this isn't what I'm on Gilligan's
island.

191
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,540
This is a real like I can't get out of
here.

192
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,940
And I,
I had a really hard time with it.

193
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,360
What was the commitment?
The commitment was 15 days.

194
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,530
So the only you,
it was a personal feeling.

195
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,890
Did it up to you like there was no,
nothing in writing.

196
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:35,870
And did you have a way to escape?
I mean I was thinking of escape plans,

197
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,960
but I'm on the monastery and this is a
little crazy that the way the monks keep

198
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,450
the lights on is they breed German
shepherds.

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,790
That's how they make money.
They breed German shepherds are,

200
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,070
the largest I've seen is they wrote a
book,

201
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,840
they wrote a book.
I have the book.

202
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,880
It's a book about raising puppies.
Correct.

203
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,290
The same guys.
Same guys.

204
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,220
Oh,
so they weren't Buddhist.

205
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,670
They were Russian Orthodox and they
raise German shepherds.

206
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,300
So they live on this property and there
are these 11 German shepherds,

207
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,680
and at the end of the property,
the only way off the property where two

208
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,920
mobile homes unconnected to the
monastery at the end of this road that

209
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,060
leads up to the monastery.

210
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,220
And both of those homes had German
shepherds as well that were a little

211
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:20,280
territorial.
So there really was no way for me to

212
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,900
escape.
Like I couldn't,

213
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,330
I ran 120 miles up and down the driveway
while I was there because I couldn't

214
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:32,250
leave the property.
So you just timed herself or paced

215
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,210
yourself using an APP or something?
I said like 2000 steps equals a mile.

216
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,220
Counted your steps.
Oh,

217
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:39,600
Jesus Christ,
dude.

218
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,040
Yeah.
I counted it and marked it to,

219
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,520
what did they think about you running
around back and forth like that?

220
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Thought it was a fucking psychopath.
I'm like,

221
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,740
you guys have been here for 50 years,
man.

222
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,470
I'm just trying to get some extra sales.
What are the,

223
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,200
the guys like that had been there for 50
years?

224
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,650
Uh,
quiet now.

225
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,420
They were,
they were,

226
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,800
you know,
extremely listened to date.

227
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,680
They were doing what they wanted to do
with their life.

228
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,200
So they were super happy.
Really?

229
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,700
Yes,
super present.

230
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,470
I mean very present and I mean I live in
a world that to do list man and like,

231
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:15,180
you know,
they were very present,

232
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,660
very happy and really,
really nice to me.

233
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,500
And everybody.
Did you talk to them?

234
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,550
They speak English.
What was the conversation like?

235
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,301
Like what,
what,

236
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:29,370
what do you say to a guy who's been in a
monastery for 50 years?

237
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:31,170
Just staring at the walls while I
wanted,

238
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:32,850
if I could have talked to him about the
pageant,

239
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,430
that would have been just a conversation
he brought,

240
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,530
I know,
super confused.

241
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Uh,
when I first got up there and they would

242
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,030
ask me a little bit about my background.
I told them,

243
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:43,800
you know,
how's in the private jet business?

244
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,110
They didn't understand private jets
really?

245
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,180
And then I said,
I had a coconut water company.

246
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,500
They never heard of coconut water.
I told them I was involved with the

247
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,300
Atlanta Hawks and one of the monk said,
Oh,

248
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,840
I've been to a an expos game.
And I'm like,

249
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,150
that's a different sport and they don't
play,

250
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:04,830
they don't exist anymore.
And this is very like timewarp at first.

251
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,710
It was really interesting,
really interesting.

252
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,140
Jesus.
Now what led these,

253
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,080
these guys that are 50 years,
50 years on the Montessori,

254
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,060
how old were they?
Uh,

255
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:18,360
so some of the,
the age range from,

256
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:23,250
I think the youngest monk was probably
35 up until late seventies.

257
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,830
So late seventies with the guys that had
been there for 50 years.

258
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,660
They checked in when they were 20.
Yeah,

259
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:30,750
in their young twenties in the same
spot.

260
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,420
They actually built this monastery by
hand.

261
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:36,750
They bought 500 acres for very,
you know,

262
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,060
I think it was like $50,000 or
something.

263
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:39,990
I mean,
something crazy.

264
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,690
And then they built the monastery by
hand.

265
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,320
And so it's been a passion of love and
labor and they've been there since.

266
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,190
And so the vow of celibacy,
the whole deal and poverty,

267
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,260
poverty,
insolvency at 20.

268
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,470
Yeah.
They,

269
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:02,350
they take a vow for things of um,
celibacy.

270
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,390
Poverty's,
they pledge all their personal

271
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,600
belongings to the monastery.
So really they're only possession is a

272
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,900
driver's license.
Obedience and stability.

273
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,600
Meaning we're not leaving.
This is what we're going to do.

274
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,070
So I mean talk about discipline just off
the charts to do forever.

275
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,170
Forever.
And where do they get funding?

276
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,550
They're self sufficient.
So they stay breeds German shepherds,

277
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,890
they sell them.
That's kind of one income stream.

278
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,690
And then their master's world masters of
dog training training.

279
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,430
So every two weeks they have 10 dogs
that come in and they,

280
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:40,150
and I've watched this,
I mean they literally dogs come in like

281
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:42,160
spuds Mackenzie and leave.

282
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Like they just left etiquette school.
Like it was like anytime you're in the

283
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:51,250
presence of the people that are the best
in the world,

284
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:53,800
that what they do,
it's fucking fascinating.

285
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,220
And these guys were masters.
They are the masters of,

286
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,340
I'm sure there's a lot of people that
are great but in their space of dog

287
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:06,370
training and breeding,
what was so special about the way they

288
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,590
trained dogs?
Just the command,

289
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:11,380
like,
like they had an energy that the dogs

290
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,630
responded to.
I mean like I would walk in and the dogs

291
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:15,730
would go crazy.
They'd sniff my nuts.

292
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:17,290
They just like,
they go nuts,

293
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,240
right?
These guys would walk in and like they

294
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:21,490
could just sense that they were in
control,

295
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,330
they were in control and like the eye
contact that they,

296
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,340
everything,
the way that they talk,

297
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,950
their tone,
their hand mannerisms,

298
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,170
they just have mastered this and they
have a deep connection with the dogs.

299
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,620
Dogs are weird in that way.
Like I have a one year old golden

300
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:42,940
retriever and he has different rules for
different people and he knows who he can

301
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,380
get away with.
What with uh,

302
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,120
my wife's mom has zero shot at
controlling this dog.

303
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,100
Like,
it's like,

304
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,101
he's like,
ah,

305
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:51,461
no,
no,

306
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:52,630
no.
I'm the boss.

307
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,430
I think I'm going to jump up on you and
kiss.

308
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,251
Yeah.
You know?

309
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,950
No,
I'm going to just run around and put a

310
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,320
pause on you when you sit in a chair and
you know,

311
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:00,131
we're like,
Marshall,

312
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,600
come on man.
What the fuck?

313
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,980
What is this?
You don't do this?

314
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:07,240
And it doesn't matter when she's here.
He just decides Mac new set of rules

315
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,310
with this lady.
She doesn't seem to know what the fuck

316
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:11,680
to do with me.
But when,

317
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,780
uh,
I had a trainer that I worked with him

318
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,310
for in the beginning when I first got
him and when Ryan,

319
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:20,950
the trainer comes over,
he just like sits down,

320
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,080
he's super chill,
he listens.

321
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,651
He's like,
Oh,

322
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:25,110
this guy knows what the fuck to do.
Yeah,

323
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,300
he knows how to control me.
It's,

324
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,730
it's very interesting.
He's even different with me than he is

325
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:32,860
with my friends.
Like my friends will come over.

326
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:33,880
It's like,
let me try you out,

327
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,520
motherfucker,
pause on you and see what's up.

328
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,450
And I wish she would be like across the
board with everybody.

329
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:42,310
But he's just,
it's all love.

330
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,600
So it's not bad,
you know,

331
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:44,800
he's just a you dog.

332
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,220
Yeah,
well it's just like pause on you and

333
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,054
shit.
You know?

334
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,640
And I'm not really a dog person and I
like dogs,

335
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,980
but don't have one.
No,

336
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,740
no.
But we don't really connect.

337
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,310
You don't connect with it.
Not,

338
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,300
not like instant love when they see me
the way that they are with other people,

339
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,000
you know,
but the monks were using that were

340
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,350
teaching me various lessons,
almost like karate kid style through the

341
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:09,710
dogs.
So like the first day I got there every

342
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:12,410
day I was signed to a different role
with,

343
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,740
I would shadow one of the monks and
there were eight and they had different

344
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,670
responsibilities around the monastery.
The first day I was in the training

345
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:23,240
center with one of the most,
it was training the dog and then my job

346
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,690
was to be the distractor.
So rainbow,

347
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:30,950
this dog would walk around and I would
fucking go adam and jump and run and

348
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,880
like try to,
you know,

349
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,060
whatever,
get him to break his goal of going.

350
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,080
They were kind of simulating a park
scene or a city scene and making this

351
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:43,160
dog not get distracted.
So I would go nuts with the pork chop

352
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:44,480
and this and throw it,
whatever.

353
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,870
The dog would just go unwavering from
point a to point b.

354
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,300
And the monk said to me at the end,
just like,

355
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:51,950
it's just like life man.
He's like,

356
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,520
if you have a

357
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,353
goal,

358
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,680
just like rainbows goal is to get from a
to B,

359
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:59,080
you can't be distracted in your goal.
And I was like,

360
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,060
that makes sense.
Some karate kid stuff,

361
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,160
like I'm like mock song.
Yeah.

362
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:07,720
Like wax on and,
but all these different lessons started

363
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,730
to emerge.
It was pretty interesting.

364
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,840
Wow.
So that,

365
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:12,671
that isn't just,
it's,

366
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,160
it's interesting too that they're doing
it with German shepherds are really,

367
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,280
really smart dogs.
I want like,

368
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,380
what's a dumb dog?
Uh,

369
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,350
what's like a generally thought of
downward dog?

370
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,240
Let's think.
Trying to think like what would

371
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:33,450
generally be thought of as a dumb dog.
There's no like,

372
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,890
yeah,

373
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,410
prejudices for dogs,
right?

374
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,630
Is there,
this is like,

375
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,520
well,
like one breed or like this dumb fucking

376
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:44,880
breed.
I don't think of like when you say like

377
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:47,400
a dumb dog,
this dumb individual dogs,

378
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,320
but I don't ever think of like,
oh,

379
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:52,530
that there's some dogs that are like
spastic,

380
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:54,570
right?
Like Jack Russell terriers are kind of

381
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:56,700
spastic,
but that's because they were raised to

382
00:16:56,701 --> 00:17:00,180
kill rats and they just like,
they have high kill drive and they're

383
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:02,220
super hyper.
Like,

384
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,730
I can't think of a dog that's supposed
to be stupid,

385
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,320
but German shepherds are generally
supposed to be smart with English

386
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,330
bulldogs,
but I don't know if that's really true.

387
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,750
I think they're just lazy,
man.

388
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,070
My dog,
brutus is half English bulldog and half

389
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:19,650
Sheebu.
He know he just has bad joints and he's

390
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:21,300
just lazy.
He's just,

391
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,390
I don't think he's stupid.
Yeah,

392
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,370
it's kind of a dick.
He said Dick to other dogs,

393
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:28,500
but I just think that's because he's in
pain a lot.

394
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,470
These dogs were super smart.
They're so smart,

395
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,770
man.
Those dogs look at you and they're

396
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,070
little.
They're sizing you up,

397
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:37,020
checking you out,
see what the fuck you're up to.

398
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:40,590
Make sure you're cool,
but there's like this feeling like they

399
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,650
know they could kill you,
like they're looking at you like,

400
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,420
I could kill you,
but I'm just checking you out.

401
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,480
I had that feeling that they could kill
me too.

402
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,620
Yeah.
It's a real feeling.

403
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Yeah.
Yeah,

404
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:51,810
they can and they were like,
I was scared.

405
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:55,130
They were sensing that he's trying to
like down.

406
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,670
Downplay my fear.
Yeah.

407
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,820
My friend who trains them has a,
a dog that's like,

408
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,910
he does police work and it's like a
serious fucking dog and he'll attack

409
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,490
like a thing.
If you're holding like a stick,

410
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,940
like on command and he jumps and one of
the things he does,

411
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,750
he bites the stick and then to pause,
go right into your nuts.

412
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,660
And I don't think it's on purpose,
but damn,

413
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:22,380
it's an effective strategy.
Like it's like bite and then nuts stomp

414
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,970
all in one maneuver.
Right?

415
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,220
Yeah.
But those dogs are,

416
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,600
you know,
they're uh,

417
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,100
they're a dog that's sort of bread and
designed for protection work and police

418
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:32,760
work and stuff.

419
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,260
Yeah,
they are.

420
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:37,830
And they train their dogs as pets.
So they didn't do any kind of,

421
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,600
you know,
police work or anything like that.

422
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,040
So that the 11 German shepherds that
were on the property was super well

423
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:44,611
behaved.
I mean,

424
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:47,910
like ridiculously well behaved.
So when they train them or they're just

425
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:50,010
training them to make sure that they're
obedient,

426
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,810
you know,
they just listen,

427
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,670
watch the house,
bark at strangers,

428
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:54,540
that kind of shit.
Yeah.

429
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,720
Hand signals obedient,
you know,

430
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,590
not jumping,
but really that,

431
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,930
you know,
they know who's in control.

432
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,310
So did these guys do that before they
started running the monastery or was it

433
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,250
something that they decided to do while
they had the monastery?

434
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,001
No.
So they,

435
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,110
uh,
they fell into it.

436
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,570
They didn't go up there.
They,

437
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,860
none of them had any experience in dog
training.

438
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,840
Uh,
that wasn't the intent.

439
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,910
They just said,
we've got to keep the lights on here.

440
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,860
And they had a dog,
they had a dog as a pet and fell in love

441
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,470
with a dog.
And ultimately they,

442
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,390
when the dog passed away,
they all got killed.

443
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,090
Uh,
they wanted another dog and they went to

444
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:34,290
a breeder and they got two dogs and they
actually just,

445
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
they realize that they,
you know,

446
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
once they bred an amazing puppy,
I lived their first litter that and

447
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,910
train these dogs that there was demand
and they just scaled it like any other

448
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:46,170
business,
you know,

449
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,780
and they learned along the way,
trial and error,

450
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,460
just like any entrepreneur.
I mean,

451
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,350
these guys will like,
first of all,

452
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,810
they were monks in there.
They're super spiritual.

453
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:56,610
They're religious,
they were Russian Orthodox,

454
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:59,580
they weren't in Buddhist.
And um,

455
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,910
but they're amazing entrepreneurs.
I mean like they ran this thing super

456
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:08,610
efficiently,
but the point would only be to make

457
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,110
enough money to keep the lights on.

458
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,910
Correct.
So as an entrepreneur,

459
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,090
it's almost like they're,
they're,

460
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,640
they're limited in their ambition.
I think excess,

461
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,990
you know,
it's not like they're,

462
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,520
if they have excess money and revenue,
it's not going to material things,

463
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,560
but it's for the life and the extension
of them,

464
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,040
of the monitors monastery,
they would save it and put it away for

465
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,390
taxes or what have you.
Yeah.

466
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:31,230
Or they have,
you know,

467
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,490
they're in the hands of God.
They have,

468
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,610
they don't have a lot of litters or they
don't have a lot of puppies or they have

469
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,570
no income.
Right,

470
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,340
right.
That's fascinating.

471
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,670
Now these guys,
what do they do for recreation?

472
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,760
Uh,
they pray Jesus,

473
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,250
they think they read,
what do they read?

474
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,030
And they have like an amazing collection
of books,

475
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,570
fiction,
everything really super low red.

476
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,990
So they do have some entertainment in
terms of like fiction.

477
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,700
Yeah.
And you know,

478
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:02,930
periods of it.
And I went up there with no expectation.

479
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,500
The only,
like I had heard of monks,

480
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,810
I watched,
I've seen monks in movies and read

481
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:10,480
articles and blogs,
but I never,

482
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,030
I didn't know much about it,
about the culture,

483
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,960
certainly about Russian Orthodox and the
different factions and this and that.

484
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,430
Um,
so I went up there,

485
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,940
eyes wide open and um,
but I,

486
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,840
I went up there really just to detach
and get away from feeling overloaded and

487
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:27,730
feeling distracted.
And Man,

488
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:30,910
I'm a father of four and I have a
business and my wife has an entrepreneur

489
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:33,250
and Sandra and I just wanted to see
like,

490
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,010
you know,
it's is Kinda my been my journey.

491
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,170
I learned best by diving into the
unknown,

492
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,880
just like I did with Dave.
And it just says,

493
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,710
I,
I've done in businesses and other

494
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:44,200
things,
it's just like I learned best by going

495
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:45,034
into the unknown.

496
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,840
So I didn't do a lot of research around
them or how they made money or this or

497
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,040
that.
I just kind of showed up.

498
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,410
Wow.
That's a,

499
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,030
it's a crazy undertaking.
But I guess if you knew you only had 15

500
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:01,120
days,
at least you have like some light at the

501
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:04,620
end of the rain,
but when that 15th Day came and what did

502
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,430
you get in a car and drive away from
that place?

503
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,890
Yeah.
How fucking good did it feel?

504
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:12,050
Did you check your phone?
Just felt really on data.

505
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,190
What's going on on twitter?
I'm on day four and five.

506
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,720
I was already kind of making excuses.
I was rationalizing in my head that's

507
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:21,280
seven days would be enough.
So like in my head I was going home day

508
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:22,430
seven.
Oh,

509
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,441
well,
I mean I was like,

510
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:27,190
no one's going to know the difference or
care if I went 15 days or seven days or

511
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,320
is not like if you're at mile 50 and
you're like,

512
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,150
that's enough.
It is.

513
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,270
Same kind of thing.
Same kind of thing until you wake up the

514
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,770
next day and you're like,
I dropped out.

515
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,723
Right.
And you feel like,

516
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,110
you know,
so,

517
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,820
um,
anyway,

518
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
I decided like,
you know,

519
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,710
I'm going to stick this out.
And then when I left it was a,

520
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,900
it was a good feeling.
And the feeling was proud.

521
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,710
I felt proud of myself for sticking
through it.

522
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:51,760
You know?
Isn't that funny?

523
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,830
These guys had been there for 50 years.
50 years,

524
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:54,431
man.
And you're like,

525
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:56,140
I did two weeks,
man.

526
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,230
It felt good.
I bet it's it.

527
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,110
It also felt good to go through a bed.
Well,

528
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:04,450
it's the 50 years when you're describing
that.

529
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:07,540
That seems so insane to me that I can't
even relate.

530
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,430
But when you're talking about your 15
days,

531
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,061
I'm like,
man,

532
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:12,520
you poor bastard.
Like I feel bad for you.

533
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,540
The guy that 50 50 years,
he might as well be living in another

534
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,390
dimension.
Yeah.

535
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,040
As far as I'm concerned.
Yeah.

536
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,010
I went in there and it's twenties that
is just so nothing,

537
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,410
no sex,
no family,

538
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,990
no,
no neighborhood.

539
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,570
Nope.
No fucking hobbies.

540
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,850
No drive to work.
Nope.

541
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,040
Fuck.
And you know their,

542
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,190
their impression of it is like,
we made this decision so it's not,

543
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:42,250
we didn't sacrifice it like we decided
this is the life we want to live.

544
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,070
But when he made this decision,
it was 19 what?

545
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,490
1965

546
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,070
or some shit.
That's just black and white tvs.

547
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,410
Oh my God,
that's a crazy decision.

548
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,710
That's crazy too to decide back then.
Like I,

549
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,610
I,
I see what's coming and I've had enough,

550
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,940
I've had enough these daily newspapers.
It's just too much information.

551
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,960
Right,
exactly.

552
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,000
That's a crazy time to check out.
So they don't know what the fuck's going

553
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,830
on in the world.
Did you quiz them on shit,

554
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,530
I didn't really quiz them.
I mean,

555
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,720
they,
every Sunday night they have one,

556
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,660
there's one TV and one back room and
they watch the news.

557
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,600
So they get a sense of just like,
you know,

558
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,450
kind of where we are.
State of the Union war.

559
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,880
If there's a nuclear meltdown.
Yeah.

560
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,040
One hour.
Uh,

561
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,110
yeah.
They watch about an hour on Sunday

562
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,640
night,
one night a week.

563
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,670
And that's how the tuner who do they
crazy.

564
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,890
I was immediately like,
my head went to like,

565
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,650
I'm sure we're being attacked right now
and I'm stuck at the monastery.

566
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:45,410
I'm sure the airlines are flying and I'm
stuck here for another 30 days.

567
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,390
Right.
No,

568
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,330
my mind went to a place where I was
thinking just the worst of everything.

569
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,850
You know,
what news do they trust?

570
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,660
Uh,
I think they trust it all,

571
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,540
but like which channel do they go to?
Oh,

572
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,740
they would just watch like,
you know,

573
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,830
uh,
the local ABC,

574
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,780
see the local network,
whatever's local in upstate New York.

575
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,640
They weren't Netflix options.
Do they have internet?

576
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,270
Uh,
I had no access to the Internet and I

577
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:16,340
think they have access probably for
their job,

578
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,390
but I didn't know actually.
So the dog training Jesus Christ,

579
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,930
it was wild.
But why is that so romantic to people?

580
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:25,700
Because it is,
it's a very romantic,

581
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,040
right?
There's something about this idea of

582
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,810
checking out.
It's just,

583
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,940
I had a buddy who did it.
I mean,

584
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,590
for all I know,
he still does it.

585
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,620
I lost touch with them 25 plus years
ago,

586
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,040
but he was a taekwondo guy and he
started to meditate because he was

587
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:47,810
always very nervous about sparring and
very nervous about competition.

588
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,630
So excuse me.
He was trying to figure out what was

589
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:51,800
going on.
So he said,

590
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,810
let me just take some meditation
classes.

591
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,210
It took some meditation classes and
really enjoyed it,

592
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,830
got really,
really into it.

593
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,280
And then one day decided to give up all
the worldly possessions and all of the

594
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,930
trappings of civilization and move into
the monastery.

595
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,440
And I remember we went,
we met him for lunch one day,

596
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:17,360
he'd also become a vegetarian.
So you only ate vegetables and we were

597
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:20,960
all just hanging around and he,
he seemed oddly a piece and it was so

598
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,090
confusing to me because at the time I
was like probably 20 and I was just

599
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,100
didn't know what the fuck is going on in
the world.

600
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:33,101
He was maybe 10 years older than me and
this guy just decided I've had enough.

601
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,350
It was weird to me though.
He made me nervous.

602
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,701
Like,
you know,

603
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:41,210
like he made me nervous that like he was
onto something.

604
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,220
It may be nervous that he wiser

605
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,510
than me,
that it highlighted how fucked up I am.

606
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:50,400
And you know,
especially at 20 years,

607
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,370
it's so life is so chaotic,
right?

608
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,830
No idea what the future holds for you.
If it's going to be success or failure,

609
00:26:58,021 --> 00:27:01,110
if you're going to slip it every fucking
banana peel you run across.

610
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,500
But he seemed to have it figured out,
sitting there and eating vegetables,

611
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,200
all common shit.
Where's he now?

612
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,270
I have no idea.
I lost touch with them.

613
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,280
I lost touch with them,
you know,

614
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,400
probably like 30 years ago.
But,

615
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,480
uh,
when I was 20,

616
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:20,590
those guys freaked me out too.
They must've freaked you out just when

617
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:21,640
you did this book.
I mean,

618
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,290
I freaked them out.
Really?

619
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,200
I was an alien and I came in there high
energy,

620
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:27,870
you know,
Rah Rah and like,

621
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,790
he's the only guys ever done that.
Uh,

622
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
probably probably at this particular
place,

623
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:36,280
I think for an extended period of time.
Like that.

624
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,230
Yeah.
Wow.

625
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,020
What w w why did they let you do it?
Well,

626
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:43,810
that I had written a book,
Pryor,

627
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,080
uh,
living with a seal and they knew I was

628
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:49,330
coming up there to write a book.
And,

629
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,370
uh,
I guess they liked the first book.

630
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,650
Well,
I'm sure it be good for the dog business

631
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:54,700
too.
Yeah,

632
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,050
yeah.
Yeah.

633
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,420
So they read your book,
they read my book.

634
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,160
Were you allowed to read books while you
were there?

635
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,260
I was allowed to.
I brought,

636
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,280
I brought,
uh,

637
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,750
I'm not like a big reader,
so I figured two books would carry me

638
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,190
for 50,
for 15 days.

639
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:11,810
But I read them,
I read both in like the first day,

640
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,230
like the first two days.
Cause Yeah.

641
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,210
So then I was like a check whatever they
have.

642
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,440
Oh look,
Mary poppins.

643
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,150
Yeah.
I read this stupid shit.

644
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,190
Yeah.
I said I'm good.

645
00:28:21,191 --> 00:28:22,780
Just thinking.
Wow.

646
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,860
So was there any point at like day 13
when you're like,

647
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,020
I actually Kinda liked this?
Yes.

648
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,140
I think around day seven and once I
realized like,

649
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,360
you know,
I got the excuses out of my head that

650
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:35,590
I'm staying,
I'm not,

651
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,573
I'm not leaving.

652
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,320
I mean this,
this is what I'm doing.

653
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,700
And I settled into it.
I got tremendously energized because

654
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,100
like at the monastery,
you don't make any decisions.

655
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,030
Do you eat when they tell you to eat,
you eat what they tell you to eat.

656
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,640
You go to service.
When the Church Bell Rings,

657
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:55,210
you go [inaudible] one outfit.
I showered once.

658
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,690
So all of these,
all the decisions were taken away from

659
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:00,580
you.
But when all the decisions are taken

660
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:02,950
away from you,
it frees up so much energy.

661
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,400
So I was getting like super clear and I
was like,

662
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,590
I like this.
This is like no one could get to me.

663
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm not getting bombarded.
No one can schedule appointments with

664
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:12,784
me.
Hmm.

665
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,050
This isn't so bad.
Have you ever done a sensory deprivation

666
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:20,020
tank?
[inaudible] there's

667
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,320
the thing about the sensory deprivation.
You know what it is,

668
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:24,840
right?
The thing that's most interesting about

669
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:29,841
it is that in the absence of input,
your brain is freer and you can make

670
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:33,270
decisions better and think about things
better because there's no input coming

671
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,590
in.
You don't think about it.

672
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:39,591
But as we're sitting here just touching,
this table is input.

673
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,010
You are not looking at each other across
the lights.

674
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,370
All of this is input.
And in that tank there's no input.

675
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,940
And in the absence of input,
it frees up more resources for your

676
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:51,130
brain.
So in a sense,

677
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:55,090
what these monks you're saying or doing
by having everything on a schedule,

678
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:58,600
you don't have to think about anything
and there's nothing coming in.

679
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,060
There's no twitter,
facebook,

680
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:02,680
all that jazz.
You're,

681
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,570
you have more resources.
Correct.

682
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,433
And he feel better.

683
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,540
That's exactly it.
That's exactly right.

684
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,310
And I experienced that,
you know,

685
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:13,330
I think the average American makes like
35,000 to 50,000 decisions a day.

686
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,060
And there's a real thing called decision
fatigue.

687
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,103
Really?
Yeah.

688
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,190
And when you eliminate all,
like I remember when I came home,

689
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,490
I came home and the day I got home,
my wife is like,

690
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,610
Sweetie,
I'm going to take the kids to school and

691
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,560
I'm gonna take the blue car.
I was like,

692
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,670
cool,
take the blue car.

693
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,260
And she came back a minute later.
He's like,

694
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:34,390
you know what?
I don't think the other car,

695
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:36,400
because I want to park in the blue cars
too big.

696
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,050
And I was like,
I could take the other car.

697
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,640
And then she came back in,
she goes,

698
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,740
you know what,
I'm going to take the blue car because

699
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:42,670
I'm like,
Sarah,

700
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,150
you're using so much energy or already
it's 7:45 AM on what car to drive.

701
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,400
And I realized like,
that happens all the time.

702
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,960
You know,
it's like exhausting,

703
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:54,970
man.
And you,

704
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:55,990
I'm sorry,
go on.

705
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,350
No,
no,

706
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,990
I'm just saying like when you know,
I didn't have any of that.

707
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,830
So it freed up all this energy.
I'm not just making like massive life

708
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:05,830
lists what I want to do.
I became very aware of my relationship

709
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,470
with time.
I mean when we think of relationships,

710
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:12,310
we think of our relationships with our
mom or a dad or a kids or this and that.

711
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:14,770
But like no one thinks of a relationship
with time.

712
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,150
Now I'm turning 50 the average American
lives to be 78 years old.

713
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,000
So if I'm average,
I hope I'm not,

714
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:24,580
but that means I got 28 years of life
left.

715
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,450
If you reverse engineer that,
if you reverse engineer it,

716
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,370
you know like I just climbed Mt.
Washington,

717
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:33,340
I don't know,
70 year olds climbing Mount Washington,

718
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,150
the act,
the actual years that you have left to

719
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:39,250
be active and do the shit that we want
to do.

720
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,760
They shrink significantly as a
percentage as you get older.

721
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,850
So once you get aware of your
relationship with time,

722
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,230
everything shifts.
And I had a fundamental shift when I

723
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:52,390
came home with,
as it relates to my relationship with

724
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:56,200
time and who I want to spend it with and
what I want to do.

725
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,040
And I want to put more on my plate of
the stuff that I love to do with the

726
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:03,670
people I love to do it with.
And I started getting like a lot of

727
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:08,290
clarity around that when I wasn't
getting bombarded with everything else.

728
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,040
Like I don't spend any time alone.
The only time I spent a loan as when if

729
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:14,350
I go for a run,
everything else is I'm getting

730
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,230
influenced by everybody else and
everything else.

731
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,580
So I'm losing my main superpower,
my instinct to survive.

732
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:23,170
I've got a 90 on my sat man.

733
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:28,060
I survive on instinct and gut and I was
losing that because I was so distracted.

734
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,290
So once I started to get that alone time
and you have to go to a monastery to do

735
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:32,950
it,
you just gotta,

736
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,080
you know,
carving out a little bit of time for

737
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:38,940
myself every day I just started to think
a lot clearer on like you,

738
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,900
how do I want to live?
Reverse engineer the rest of my life.

739
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,580
Wow.
Do you think this is something that you

740
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:48,050
would do on a regular basis?
No,

741
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,110
but um,
it's something that I have and I feel

742
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:51,944
like,
you know,

743
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,080
like I said,
like going into the unknown,

744
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,880
it gives you an edge,
you know,

745
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,620
it gives you,
you come out of it a little bit

746
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:59,630
different than you go in.
It doesn't have to be a monastery.

747
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:01,700
He could be a race,
it could be business experience,

748
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:02,450
like whatever.

749
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,430
Right.
But just doing something different,

750
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,580
doing it different because you know,
um,

751
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,380
so yeah,
I feel like it's,

752
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,160
I don't think I would do it again,
but I don't think I have to because I

753
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:15,620
already have.
I can tap into that when I need it.

754
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,160
Do you dental where off though?
Cause a lot of times inspiration for

755
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:20,260
people.
It's,

756
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,240
it's fleeting.
The takeaways won't,

757
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,490
won't wear off.
Like I'm already back on my phone,

758
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:27,440
I'm back in modern day life.
You know,

759
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:32,441
I'm all fucked up again.
But the main things like my relationship

760
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:35,300
with time and certain things of,
you know,

761
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:38,330
who I want to spend there with.
And what I want to do and continuing to

762
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:42,380
build what I call my life resume,
doing these things to build up my,

763
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,350
not my business resume,
but my life resume.

764
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,220
That's things that I know I want to do
more of and that will never go away.

765
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,050
So,
you know,

766
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,460
um,
there's,

767
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,310
there's things that came out of it that
will last forever.

768
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,560
Like what kind of adjustments did you
make when you came back?

769
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,230
Started saying no.
Started praying.

770
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,570
I just,
I reversed engineered my life.

771
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:04,790
So let me give you an example.
My parents are

772
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,030
88.
Okay.

773
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,800
I have a good relationship with my
parents.

774
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,510
My parents are 88.
They live in Florida.

775
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,800
I see my parents,
let's say my parents lived to be 92.

776
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:17,230
I hope they live longer,
but let's say,

777
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,280
let's say they live five years,
right?

778
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,210
I don't have five years left with my
parents.

779
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,560
I see my parents twice a year.
That means I have 10 visits with my

780
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:30,710
parents.
So when I started to look at Shit like

781
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:34,010
that,
I made significant changes.

782
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,731
Like,
okay,

783
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:36,230
I'm gonna get on a plane and see my
parents.

784
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,680
And when I'm in those moments,
my feet are on the ground.

785
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,640
That's where I am because I only have a
limited amount of time with them.

786
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,620
You understand?
It's like it's not five years people

787
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,850
like,
oh I got five more now.

788
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,890
You know how many times you see him,
man,

789
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,440
you see him two times a year you've got
10 visits.

790
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,900
So I,
I just started looking at stuff like

791
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:58,901
that and became really aware when I'm in
moments that are big moments to take it

792
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:03,290
in and take note of it.
So it has an impact on me and I

793
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,390
appreciate it.
Wow.

794
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,550
Did you,
did you shift anything else in your

795
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:09,560
life?
Like as far as like what you do with

796
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:11,900
your time during the days I did.
So,

797
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,000
you know,
I started putting parameters around

798
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:17,060
simple things like my phone.
So like I was the guy at the movie

799
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,130
theater.
I'd be checking my young,

800
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,660
forgot the bing,
I'd like look under my shirt so the

801
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,790
light doesn't light up and know what you
know.

802
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,490
Well I'm glad at least you did that
courteous.

803
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,750
Yeah,
that's true.

804
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,160
But I put parameters,
you know,

805
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:30,980
nothing I'm not keeping my phone in at,
at,

806
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,840
at nighttime.
And you know,

807
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,640
seeing anything come in at five in the
morning,

808
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,980
nothing at the dinner table with my
kids.

809
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,390
So like basic,
obvious things like that.

810
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,830
But as far as my time,
I made two really big changes.

811
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,810
One changes,
and I kind of always been doing this,

812
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,750
so I wouldn't necessarily say it was a
change,

813
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,040
but I take three hours a day for myself
religiously every day.

814
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,400
Like I literally,
he's new just since the monster.

815
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,563
It's,
it's,

816
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,880
it's kind of like,
um,

817
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,170
it's unwavering since the monastery.
It's kind of been in my life and add in

818
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:06,990
my life,
but I just made a pie chart of time.

819
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,650
It's 24 hours in a day.
We all have the same pie chart.

820
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,260
It starts the same.
And I said,

821
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:15,210
all right,
I sleep seven hours.

822
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:17,130
I mean,
sometimes I'm out of balance with them

823
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,280
doing something big and put right now
six or seven hours.

824
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,620
I take three for myself and it's
cumulative.

825
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,180
So like I'll take,
could be,

826
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,820
I'm going to go for an hour run.
I'm gonna sit in the Sauna for 20

827
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:28,470
minutes,
I'm going to do fucking nothing.

828
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,360
But when I'm in my time,
I'm not mad that I'm not with my kids or

829
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:36,270
my wife or,
or I'm not mad that I'm not at my

830
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:38,760
office.
Like that's my time and when I'm with my

831
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:41,400
kids,
I'm not mad that I'm not at work or

832
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,020
whatever cause I don't want to resent my
wife from my boss or anybody for taking

833
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:49,050
away the shit that I love to do.
Like if they said you can't run,

834
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,470
you can't go in the sauna,
I'd be really pissed off.

835
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,080
I'd be pissed at my wife.
I'd be pissed at everybody.

836
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,920
So I take three hours for myself.
The average American works 40 hours a

837
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,780
week.
That's eight hours a day.

838
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,020
You still have six hours left in the
day.

839
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,790
Now of course you have to eat,
you have to commute,

840
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,740
you got family and this and that.
But my point is even take 24 hours is a

841
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,840
long day.
I learned that running,

842
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,140
you can get a lot of shit done if you
keep moving for 24 hours.

843
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,170
Even if you take three hours for
yourself,

844
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:23,040
if you get rid of the stuff that doesn't
move the needle in the buckets that are

845
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,370
most important to you,
you can get a lot done.

846
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,970
So I take three hours for myself and
that's been a,

847
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,750
you know,
and I'm not mad about it.

848
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:36,060
I'm not like guilty about it at all.
I feel like I'm way out of balance.

849
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,590
And then the second thing actually
didn't come from the monastery,

850
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,720
but it was like kind of an offshoot of
the monastery.

851
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,450
I was mentioned to you that I climbed
Mount Washington.

852
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:46,890
Now Washington's,
um,

853
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,040
in the winter is one of the 10 most
dangerous mountains.

854
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,650
I think the climb certainly in the
states has the highest death rate

855
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,510
because the winds are go up to about
anywhere from on any given day,

856
00:37:57,511 --> 00:38:00,930
50 to a hundred miles an hour minus 35
degrees.

857
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,060
No visibility to fucking,
it's just a hundred miles an hour.

858
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,460
Yeah.
What the fuck is that like?

859
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,331
It's,
I mean,

860
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:12,840
I had an experience a hundred,
but I experienced super high winds.

861
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,260
Like when did you experience 50?
I think need more 50.

862
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:16,980
60.
Yeah.

863
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,810
What does it look like?
Well,

864
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:21,630
the first I went twice,
the first time I went to do it,

865
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,000
um,
I didn't make it to the summit because

866
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,870
it was too dangerous.

867
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:29,370
A T I actually timed out like I don't
have enough time to get back to make it

868
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,810
an altitude.
Uh,

869
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,730
no,
just in the amount of darkness,

870
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,860
darkness,
they would just gotten too too,

871
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,870
too tough to get back down.
I was with five friends,

872
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:39,880
no tour guide.
I mean did everything wrong.

873
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,900
Right.
And I actually came home after that

874
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,280
attempt,
which was a year ago,

875
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,790
and I was talking to my wife about it
and I was getting,

876
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:52,050
I posted it on facebook so everybody was
blasted.

877
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,550
You make it,
you know,

878
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,300
not Washington is only about four or
five,

879
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:57,460
five miles to the top,
4.6 miles.

880
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,740
Just the elements in the weather that
make it so hard.

881
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,350
And I said to my wife,
I failed.

882
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,730
You know,
like I didn't make it.

883
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,280
I feel like an ass.
I'm so disappointed.

884
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,480
You know,
I want to go back.

885
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,110
And she said,
well,

886
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,990
get a tour guide,
break in your boots,

887
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,310
properly trained for this and go back
next winter and check it off your list.

888
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,500
And I was like,
next winter,

889
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,830
I'm going back on Saturday next winter.
Like who knows if I'm going to be

890
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:26,560
healthy it off next winter.
So I went back next winter,

891
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,590
I mean that Saturday with the same guys.
And we did it.

892
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,980
And then recently this year I took my
son who's eight,

893
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,390
not to the top,
but we're like,

894
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,300
we're going to go camp out.
I want you to experience this,

895
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,150
got them a minus 40 sleeping bag and all
this stuff.

896
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:42,460
And we went out there with,
my friend is a police officer and

897
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:45,040
Suffolk County.
He brought his daughter and we're

898
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:48,400
sitting on out there sleeping outside,
fucking freezing,

899
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,410
fucking freezing and I'm all bundled up.
And I turned to him and I'm like,

900
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:56,140
Kevin,
how often do you do shit like this?

901
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,550
You know,
he's a police officer,

902
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:00,400
he's the happiest guys,
rock star shape.

903
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,970
And he goes,
I call it the Kevin rule.

904
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:09,330
He goes every year.
I go on one trip a year with my college

905
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,820
roommates been doing since I'm 21 and
then once every two months I take a

906
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,830
weekend and I do something.
I go camping.

907
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:20,320
I would run a marathon,
I'll go hiking,

908
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:23,050
I'll go to whatever with my family or
friends.

909
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,420
And I said to myself,
if I can't,

910
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:29,170
going back to your question about time,
if I can't take a weekend,

911
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,820
every eight weeks,
once every two months,

912
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:37,540
if I can't carve out a day or two to
take some kind of adventure to put on my

913
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:40,690
life resume or to have collected a
moment for me,

914
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,470
then my life is out of balance.
I call it the Kevin rule.

915
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,840
And I said,
if I live 30 more years,

916
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,050
if I live to 80 and I do that,
you know,

917
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:53,010
for 30 years it's 150 or a hundred
basic,

918
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:57,820
150 more fucking amazing memories that
I'm going to create.

919
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:03,270
And that became another one of these
time-related monastery related urgency

920
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,130
rules.
So I just,

921
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,460
again,
it just became a real big clarity around

922
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,360
like,
man,

923
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,470
I want to live with urgency and I want
to do as much shit as I can and put as

924
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,760
much on my plate of this stuff.
I love to do with the people I love in

925
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:22,060
my life and have it on my resume and
that's how I want to live my life

926
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:23,890
forward.
That's very inspiring.

927
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,940
So when you decided to cut out or carve
out three hours a day for yourself,

928
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,250
what was the first ship that you
eliminated?

929
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,770
Literally just saying no to the request
for my time.

930
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,180
Like what kind of Shit?
Hey,

931
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,200
yet Jessica,
can you take,

932
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,034
can you,
um,

933
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,590
do you think you can meet me for lunch?
I want to talk to you about an a

934
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,760
business idea that I have,
uh,

935
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,220
in the beverage space.

936
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,890
I know that you had your coconut water.
I want to talk to you about that.

937
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,290
No,
I'm going for a run,

938
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,090
you know?
Oh No,

939
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:55,430
I don't want any money.
I don't want any money.

940
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,810
I just want to talk to you for 15
minutes.

941
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:57,980
A friend of mine.
No,

942
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,310
you think on Friday night you can come
down for fifth and see this?

943
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,800
No,
because it's cumulative.

944
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,070
It's not one or I mean,
listen,

945
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,360
I made my one person ever,
no,

946
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,090
no,
it's going to be one person every day or

947
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:14,720
so with some new requests.
So that was the first shift.

948
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:17,360
And the second thing is for the,
and I put myself first,

949
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,710
you know,
in a,

950
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,360
in a lot of times I don't,
but in certain times I do.

951
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,540
And um,
I realized that I was,

952
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,310
this is kind of,
maybe might be a little bit more

953
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:31,310
specific,
but I realized I love football.

954
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,950
I'll watch a lot of football,
man.

955
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,590
I realized that I was watching two
games,

956
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:39,950
the college game on Saturday,
fantasy football Sunday.

957
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:42,860
I'm locked in Sunday night game,
Monday night,

958
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:46,490
Thursday night.
And I realized that if at this point,

959
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:51,491
if I live to be 85 80 whatever,
that would be 36,000 hours of football,

960
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,640
36,000 hours football,
that I'd be watching that throw in some

961
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,050
of the fights,
throwing some of the other stuff.

962
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,270
It's like I pulled out this,
took the,

963
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,710
the fo the plug out and I freed up these
36,000 hours and my wife said,

964
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,180
don't want,
what do you mean you google live in the

965
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:08,990
monastery?
I'm like,

966
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,190
it's 15 days,
sweetie.

967
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,330
I just freed up 36,000 hours.
You get the benefit of that.

968
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,890
I'm going for 15 days.
So I freed up the time by eliminating

969
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,600
stuff that like fucking didn't move the
needle.

970
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,750
So you stop watching football told I
still watch it,

971
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,720
but I mean I became very aware of it and
I'll just like,

972
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,430
I still watch it,
but I check in.

973
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:30,210
I'm not sitting around,
you know,

974
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,970
on Sunday.
And nothing wrong with it.

975
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,060
It's just,
it wasn't moving the needle in my

976
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:37,730
family,
my finances or my wellness.

977
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:44,060
But what about recreation?
Does recreation time is that valuable?

978
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:48,760
Like enjoying things like sitting back
and watching a good movie enjoying?

979
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,600
Absolutely,
and I do.

980
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,190
I do,
but I'm not,

981
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,390
I'm not,
you know,

982
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,180
I'm asking for myself as much as I'm
asking for you.

983
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,471
Uh,
yeah.

984
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:58,071
I mean,
I think,

985
00:43:58,071 --> 00:43:59,720
look,
you gotta be happy and do the things you

986
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,850
like to do.
But you know,

987
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,170
again,
for me,

988
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,300
I look at it,
I look at it very simply.

989
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,670
I got three or four buckets.
I got my family and my wellness plan,

990
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,000
my finances and causes that are
important to me.

991
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,150
And you know,
if it's not moving the needle in those

992
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,030
four buckets,
it's really just a distraction.

993
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,980
Honestly.
Now that doesn't mean I'm not going to

994
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:20,120
go to a movie.
That's family.

995
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:20,570
That's,
well,

996
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,570
it's part of my wellness,
relaxing as part of my wellness.

997
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,910
You want to go,
but you know,

998
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,590
um,
those are kind of,

999
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,390
everything else kind of gets to know,
like going to lunch to,

1000
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:35,160
to look at someone else's idea and a
category I don't really know much about

1001
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,100
because they want to maybe get to me or
they weren't my wife.

1002
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,670
No,
no,

1003
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,113
no,
no,

1004
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,640
no.
I should make a tee shirt.

1005
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,280
I've said,
listen,

1006
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,530
I get it.
When I was starting out as an

1007
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:52,110
entrepreneur when I was 20 years old,
you know,

1008
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,860
and I was cleaning kiddie pools and
through in the music business I was

1009
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,980
doing all this stuff.
I laugh at a lot of jokes that were

1010
00:44:58,981 --> 00:44:59,814
funny.

1011
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,740
I know what you mean.
You know what I mean?

1012
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,740
Yeah.
To get deals to get stuff out of La

1013
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,720
Laugh and I'm sick of laughing at jokes
than on funny.

1014
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,730
That's actually very funny.
Like you saying that it's very funny.

1015
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,510
It's a smart thing to do.
But in the beginning it's very hard,

1016
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:17,250
right?
Because you're trying to get momentum,

1017
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:19,020
you're trying to establish
relationships.

1018
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,030
You're,
you want people to like you.

1019
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:25,050
You don't want to dead face a stupid
joke that have people go,

1020
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:27,420
fuck that Jesse Guy,
that guy's a dick and I'm not doing

1021
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:28,254
anything with it.
Yeah.

1022
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,240
So you laugh.
Yeah.

1023
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:36,000
Hmm.
So do you organize your time like very

1024
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,130
specifically now and did you do that in
the past?

1025
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,970
I do now.
I did it in the past cause you know,

1026
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:44,400
in the path I do it,
I'm a do anything.

1027
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,230
I say yes to two action things without
really thinking them through very often.

1028
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,190
Right now what I do is I have a third
grade,

1029
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:56,910
three year old system.
I have two notebooks.

1030
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm kind of old school.
I don't really operate well keeping

1031
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:03,390
stuff and phones.
I just take everything that comes into

1032
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:05,850
my head and I put it on.
I'd dump it out in my head to free up

1033
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,940
space in my head.
So I have one journal that has

1034
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,080
everything I need to do and I just do
that to get it out of my head.

1035
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:17,250
So I don't have to remember that I have
to get my son's friends eight year old

1036
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:19,620
birthday present for Saturday.
I just write it down.

1037
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,110
It doesn't mean it goes away,
but it's out of my head.

1038
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,190
Right.
And then I have my daily from that list

1039
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:28,140
I picked the most important things that
have to get done.

1040
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,020
And then I know the night before I write
them down or,

1041
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,020
or the beginning of the week,
I just knock them out man.

1042
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,180
And how long ago was it that you went to
this monastery and did this fear?

1043
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,440
The year ago,
one year ago,

1044
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:44,580
and has this enthusiasm or this feeling
waned at all?

1045
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,020
No.
Wow.

1046
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,230
That's really interesting.
Do you think you conveyed that in the

1047
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:51,120
book?
I do.

1048
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:51,881
I mean,
I,

1049
00:46:51,881 --> 00:46:54,090
I've been living,
I feel like I've been living my life

1050
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,070
like this even before the monastery just
reinforced a lot of things.

1051
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,650
I think combined with the fact that for
some reason,

1052
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,500
you know,
I'm turning 50 it's had,

1053
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:07,440
it's fucking with me in a way that I
didn't think it would.

1054
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,360
And I don't know how you,
how old are you?

1055
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,760
50 yeah.
So I don't know if you had the same

1056
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:12,960
impact on you,
but like,

1057
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,210
you know,
there's not a day that goes by where I

1058
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:16,260
don't say to myself,
man,

1059
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:21,261
in 30 years you're turning 81 to look at
live with urgency and you know,

1060
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:25,590
all those,
my enemies,

1061
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:28,440
the clock,
I feel like my enemies,

1062
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:33,441
the Klopp and there's a lot of stuff I
want to do in my life and my enemy is

1063
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:34,474
the clock.

1064
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,390
Do you feel like you live in the moment
enough?

1065
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,370
Absolutely.
You do?

1066
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,050
I do.
Because that would be the worry,

1067
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:42,910
right?
Like if you're constantly worrying

1068
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:43,541
about,
damn,

1069
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,580
20 years,
I'm going to be 70 30 years,

1070
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:47,530
I'm going be 80.
If you keep doing that,

1071
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,590
like there,
there are people that look ahead too

1072
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:52,480
much and don't just,
I've,

1073
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:54,580
I've talked to people that are 20 like,
fuck,

1074
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:56,260
I can't believe I'm 20.
And I'm like,

1075
00:47:56,261 --> 00:47:58,870
listen Motherfucker,
you just turned 20 dude,

1076
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:00,330
relax.
You know,

1077
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,320
just 20,
you're a baby.

1078
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,050
Naw Man,
I'm going to be fucking 30 and 10 years.

1079
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:07,810
Like you shut the fuck up.
You're 20 now.

1080
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,270
I use it as a motivator.
And I remember,

1081
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,110
I remember when,
how,

1082
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,750
when I was starting out.
I was 21 years old.

1083
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:15,600
This is a crazy story.
Uh,

1084
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,770
I just got dropped from our record
label.

1085
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:19,870
I was signed to a record label called
delicious vinyl.

1086
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,140
How do you do as I'm,
as I had a rap record on the way,

1087
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:26,560
she's a rapper.
I was a rapper signed to delicious with

1088
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:28,180
Tone Loc and Young Mc.
Oh,

1089
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:31,570
get the fuck outta here.
So my album doesn't get picked.

1090
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:33,100
I don't get picked up for a second
album.

1091
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,280
And I moved to New York City.
I have two things on my resume,

1092
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,910
Kiddie pool attendant cause I was a
kiddie pool attendant and rapper.

1093
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:44,470
So I'm staying on my friend's couch,
living on his couch with his roommate

1094
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,470
and he tells me on Monday I got to get
out of the apartment.

1095
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:51,190
So instead of going to look for a new
apartment over the weekend,

1096
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,010
I go to my friend's Bachelor Party on
the Jersey Shore.

1097
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,340
I'm at the Bachelor Party,
I'm getting a drink at the bar and I see

1098
00:48:57,341 --> 00:48:59,200
this girl.
I started chatting with her.

1099
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:02,710
She asked me where I live.
I told her actually as of Monday,

1100
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,910
I have nowhere to go.

1101
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,510
She takes out a Napkin.
She writes her address on the Napkin.

1102
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,870
I'm 21 years old and she says,
if it's an emergency on Monday and

1103
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:12,280
you're stuck,
you can come live with me.

1104
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,490
Monday comes,
I get kicked out of my friend's

1105
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:17,140
apartment.
I have nowhere to go.

1106
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:18,880
I'm like,
this is an emergency.

1107
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,510
I take out the Napkin and I live with
this girl and her roommate for six

1108
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:26,800
months.
Turns out that her father is a big

1109
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:30,220
entrepreneur business man.
He owns a piece of the Yankees,

1110
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:34,990
dislike monster mogul.
I write this song for the New York

1111
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:39,250
Knicks called go New York.
Go and it becomes a big success.

1112
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,700
You remember that song?
No,

1113
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:40,960
no,
no.

1114
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,830
Okay.
That's okay.

1115
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,530
That's okay.
I'm not a sports fan.

1116
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:47,350
That's fine.
It becomes a big hit and I just realized

1117
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,290
that there's an opportunity to write
theme songs for all these professional

1118
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:53,110
sports teams,
but I don't have a penny to go in the

1119
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:56,560
studio to do the demos,
to shop them to the team.

1120
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,190
So I need money.
So I go to this music guy and he says,

1121
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:05,191
I'll give you $10,000 to go and do these
songs for 10% of everything you make for

1122
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:07,720
the rest of your life.
He wants to buy me like a style of the

1123
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:10,460
rest of your life.
I'm 21 he's like the rest of them.

1124
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,980
I see life.
Everything you do,

1125
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,320
I will invest in you own an airplane
business.

1126
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,270
He owns 10% yes.
Forever.

1127
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,680
Yes.
You have to kill him then.

1128
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,210
Yes.
Yeah.

1129
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,100
You have to kill that guy,
but I need the 10 grand.

1130
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,540
So I say,
I'll take it.

1131
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,410
So before I take it,
I go to this girl's father for this

1132
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:30,550
business mogul.
Then I'm living with her and I sit down

1133
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:32,240
and I'd go to this guy's apartment
again.

1134
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:36,050
I'm 21 he's got in his apartment,
he's got a swimming pool,

1135
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,220
artwork like fancy fuck women.
He's macked out,

1136
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:41,150
man.
It's like,

1137
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,020
I've never seen anything like this in
Manhattan,

1138
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,390
in Manhattan.
I'm just setting the stage of the

1139
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:51,230
conversation.
And I go in and I tell him the story

1140
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:56,330
about the 10% and he says to me,
I would trade,

1141
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,030
this is exactly what he said to me.
I will trade everything that I have if

1142
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:02,030
you'd get out of my daughter's life.

1143
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:10,010
Exactly.
Automate everything I have for the one

1144
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:11,480
thing that you have.
And I'm like,

1145
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:12,650
man,
I'm fucking broke.

1146
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,600
What he taught me,
I go,

1147
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:15,890
what's that?
And he said,

1148
00:51:15,891 --> 00:51:19,100
youth,
because he had already gone through the

1149
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:21,140
journey,
even though he had everything,

1150
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:26,390
he already had gone through the process.
He wasn't that 20 year old that you're

1151
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:29,330
talking about,
that whatever he had gone through it,

1152
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:32,960
he had it all.
He Wa he wa he missed the process,

1153
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:37,400
the journey of being you coming up at 20
and not know like,

1154
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,630
you know,
here you are.

1155
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:40,310
But it was that,
those were the years,

1156
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:41,340
man,
right?

1157
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,880
The first fight,
the first this like that.

1158
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:47,150
That's what,
that's what makes you like so,

1159
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,680
and that stuck with me,
man.

1160
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,280
At 21 years old,
it's stuck with me and realize that

1161
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:52,641
like,
man,

1162
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:57,140
I got to enjoy the process and it's
really never rubbed off on me in front

1163
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:57,310
of me.

1164
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,540
Oh,
well why didn't that guy,

1165
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:01,790
how old was this guy at the time?
The old rich dude,

1166
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,840
he was,
let's see,

1167
00:52:02,841 --> 00:52:06,750
he must have been his sixties when they
just do shit to a bunch of shoot day

1168
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:08,200
lounging around his fucking swimming
pool.

1169
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,790
Did he did,
he had an amazing man.

1170
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,690
He was 20.
He had an amazing life.

1171
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,810
He had an amazing life.
So what did you wind up doing?

1172
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,240
Uh,
he said the SEC,

1173
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:18,950
the second part of that conversation,
he said,

1174
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,820
do you,
um,

1175
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,670
will you make this work on your own?
I said,

1176
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:23,960
I think I can.
He said,

1177
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:26,230
I didn't ask you if you can.
He said,

1178
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,143
I said,
he said,

1179
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,050
will you make it work?
I said,

1180
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,400
well,
he said,

1181
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:35,480
and then go tell the guy to fuck off and
make it and it goes and go make it work.

1182
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:36,803
And I did.

1183
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,190
So how'd you get it funded that uh,
I,

1184
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:44,180
I somehow got,
I went to the Dallas Mavericks after the

1185
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:49,181
Knicks and told them that I convinced
them to give me a $2,500 the next pay

1186
00:52:50,131 --> 00:52:52,190
me.
This is the crazy part of my life,

1187
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:56,480
but they gave me $2,500 to do the demo
and then they bought the song for like

1188
00:52:56,481 --> 00:53:00,680
$20,000 and that funded the rest of the
business that I ultimately sold to a

1189
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,020
public company.
Wow.

1190
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,140
That's crazy.
And you almost gave away 10% of your

1191
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:09,260
whole life.
That guy wanted 10% is a piece of shit.

1192
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,320
What a mother fucker like.
That's a,

1193
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,670
it's just business drives prisoners and
I had no one to go to,

1194
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,230
but I know he's taken advantage of a 21
year old kid who's just got some dreams

1195
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,350
and need some cash and 10 grand to hims,
probably nothing.

1196
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,280
I called my father and my father

1197
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,910
owned the plumbing supply house in
Mineola Long Island and I during this

1198
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,100
time in my thing and my father said,
you know,

1199
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,160
I love him to death,
but he's like,

1200
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:36,150
you know,
do it.

1201
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,600
Do what you think is best.
He just didn't,

1202
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:41,010
you know,
I didn't know who to turn to.

1203
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:42,810
I had no one to turn to.
Yeah,

1204
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,300
don't,
don't give up 10% of your life.

1205
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,150
Right.
That was just crazy that someone asks

1206
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:49,920
for that.
But you hear things like,

1207
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,450
I mean,
this is similar to what they do in the

1208
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:54,330
music business,
like how the music business treats

1209
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,640
artists.
They essentially sign you to these

1210
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:59,580
contracts and then take a piece of
everything.

1211
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:01,590
They take a piece of,
if you do a movie,

1212
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:04,740
they take a piece of your live
performances,

1213
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,230
your merchandise sales,
everything.

1214
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:07,921
They just say,
look,

1215
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:09,960
we'll,
we'll help you out a little bit,

1216
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,150
but you know,
we want you,

1217
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,313
right?

1218
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,450
Yeah.
I mean at least you're in a contract

1219
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:18,060
though,
but there's some creepy contracts that

1220
00:54:18,061 --> 00:54:20,610
they used to do in the old days of
Hollywood that were similar to that.

1221
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:23,580
Right.
They just take a pcf forever.

1222
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,460
Yeah.
Well,

1223
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,130
you know,
when I signed my music deal,

1224
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:27,330
I didn't care.
I was like,

1225
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,590
you can take whatever you want,
man.

1226
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:29,970
Get me on MTV.
Right.

1227
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,691
Of course.
Yeah.

1228
00:54:30,691 --> 00:54:31,590
Cause did all,
well,

1229
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:35,130
that's the whole idea there were the
reason why these exploitation contracts

1230
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:38,790
work is because in the beginning you're
just so desperate and what you have is

1231
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,950
what they don't have.
You have talent,

1232
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,240
right?
You have,

1233
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:45,930
as you're creative,
you're young and full of energy and

1234
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:48,240
you've got something exciting that
people want to look at.

1235
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,400
And so what they do is they go,
oh,

1236
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:51,750
you will look,
we gotta fucking,

1237
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:54,660
we got to wade through the door,
but we want 75% of the profits.

1238
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,330
We want a little bit of this and,
and you don't get any money back until

1239
00:54:57,331 --> 00:55:02,331
we recoup our money that we spent on
executives and parking and car leases

1240
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:07,320
and they calculate all that shit.
How much the fucking building costs,

1241
00:55:07,321 --> 00:55:09,540
how much the electricity,
all that stuff.

1242
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:11,460
They cow.
If you've seen those,

1243
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:12,670
I'm sure.
Oh yes.

1244
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,880
Contracts.
They're fucking sign them.

1245
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,860
I've sat in on my own way.
Yeah.

1246
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,710
But um,
you know,

1247
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:22,710
it's part of the process and no
leverage,

1248
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,270
no leverage.
That's the thing.

1249
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,000
They've got the leverage,
but now and now they don't have

1250
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:29,370
delivered,
but they still figure out a way to pull

1251
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:31,770
it off.
It's really weird because who the fuck

1252
00:55:31,771 --> 00:55:34,060
is buying an albums now?
No one,

1253
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,340
no one.
Right.

1254
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,550
Yet these record companies are still
figuring out how to cling on,

1255
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:41,370
do you like a lamprey?
Suck blood out.

1256
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:47,810
There's still staying alive and they're
fat fingers driving their fat Mercedes

1257
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:47,970
Benz.

1258
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,300
They know how to do it.
They just figured out a way to grab

1259
00:55:51,301 --> 00:55:54,480
people that are just,
just getting poppin,

1260
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,420
you know,
and just sign it and then figured out a

1261
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:00,300
way to get in with these fucking
streaming companies.

1262
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,520
If you paid attention to that shit a
little bit.

1263
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:05,400
Yeah.
That's the darkest.

1264
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:09,060
It's even darker than the music
distribution because the artists get

1265
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:12,100
like no money point.
Oh yeah.

1266
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,850
Steven Tyler was talking about it with
me.

1267
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,380
It's just,
he was explaining it and there's a,

1268
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,900
there's,
it's the company's actually,

1269
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,990
or the organization is actually called m
m a what is it?

1270
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:24,640
Something,
what did it stand for?

1271
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:28,380
Musicians for,
uh,

1272
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,640
some,
some sort of an act where they're,

1273
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,790
you know,
trying to stop these streaming companies

1274
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:37,600
from ripping off these artists' music
modernization act.

1275
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,670
Yeah.
It's dark.

1276
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,740
Yeah.
But it's along the same lines.

1277
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:46,741
It's like people figuring out a way to
just take something from somebody

1278
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,510
because you need it.
You know,

1279
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:51,070
you're broke,
you're desperate.

1280
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:51,400
You're,
so,

1281
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,730
you signed a contract.
Oh,

1282
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:56,920
we've got to by contract.
And as soon as they then music that was

1283
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:59,680
invented,
like how they put led Zepplin on the

1284
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:01,090
streaming service.
You know,

1285
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:01,924
they,
they,

1286
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,970
they,
there was no streaming when that this

1287
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,850
should be a whole new contract.
Right.

1288
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,780
I don't know.
It's true with audio books too,

1289
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,620
you know,
I mean,

1290
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,950
even bucks now and all these old
publications,

1291
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,930
they never envisioned that there would
be,

1292
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,740
you know,
I ebooks and audio books and all these

1293
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:25,120
different distribution areas.
I would imagine that audio books

1294
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:27,280
probably mirror the sales of regular

1295
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:28,590
books now.
I know.

1296
00:57:28,591 --> 00:57:29,220
So,
I mean,

1297
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:34,220
at least in my circle,
I know so many people who just use audio

1298
00:57:34,261 --> 00:57:36,540
books and they hardly ever hardly ever
read.

1299
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,200
And what they've essentially done is
taken that commuter time that was just

1300
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,140
dead air and filled it up with books.
I can't,

1301
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:43,680
when,
when I,

1302
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,510
when seal,
when I put it the seal book,

1303
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,680
I couldn't believe how many people hit
me about the audio because I did my own

1304
00:57:49,681 --> 00:57:54,030
audio book and I just couldn't,
I didn't even hear was that came out two

1305
00:57:54,031 --> 00:57:55,530
years ago.
Hmm.

1306
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:00,660
And it just never dawned on me that
people even listen to audio books when

1307
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,360
it may be angry that I did the read so
quickly.

1308
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,220
I was like,
I should have invested a little bit more

1309
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:07,830
time like gotten a coach or something.
Right.

1310
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,330
You know,
I just like read it.

1311
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,980
What percentage of your books were audio
versus paper?

1312
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,810
It's a good question.
Um,

1313
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,910
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna Guess about 30% 30 to 40 maybe

1314
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:24,180
40 30 40%.
So it's closing in closing in on 50

1315
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,060
because you know,
people can now speed it up a little bit

1316
00:58:27,061 --> 00:58:29,270
so they can get through it quicker and
you can do it when they're,

1317
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,500
you know,
when you do that with podcasts,

1318
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,780
right.
So listeners when frankly,

1319
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:35,190
I don't know,
Lola do listen to us right now.

1320
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:36,810
Like we're on speed.
Yeah.

1321
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,620
Yeah.
Now when you are done with this book

1322
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,300
and you know,
you,

1323
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:45,760
you get back from this monk thing and
you,

1324
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:49,740
you realize that this is made like some
sort of a fundamental shift in the way

1325
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:52,530
you live your life and you put this book
out.

1326
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,610
Is there a real sense that people who
read this book are going to get that

1327
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:57,660
from you?
And,

1328
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,490
I mean,
are you aware that you're probably going

1329
00:58:59,491 --> 00:59:01,620
to change the way a lot of people live
their lives?

1330
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,051
I hope so.
I mean,

1331
00:59:03,051 --> 00:59:05,510
I just,
I don't know if they'll change the lies,

1332
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:06,650
but I think it,
I hope,

1333
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,910
I hope that it helps them look through
things through a different Lens,

1334
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:12,320
you know,
and you know,

1335
00:59:12,321 --> 00:59:14,220
make their own decisions.
You know,

1336
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:18,320
one of the takeaways from the book isn't
so much a specific around the monastery.

1337
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,110
It's around this notion of building your
life resume,

1338
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,480
you know,
and just stepping into the unknown.

1339
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:24,343
Because to me,
that's,

1340
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,190
for me,
that's where I learned the best thing

1341
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,480
you could.
I could get a traditional coach or go to

1342
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,730
seminars or experts,
but I just don't learn.

1343
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:34,720
I learned by going into the unknown and
I hope it just,

1344
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,000
it just motivates people to have a
little bit more urgency and do stuff

1345
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:40,850
like that.
You don't have to go to a monastery,

1346
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,870
but you know,
there's an old Japanese ritual,

1347
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:46,310
you might be familiar with it,
I don't know,

1348
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:47,270
called the Ms Sogi.

1349
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:52,220
And the thought around them is Sogi is,
it was introduced to me by Kyle Korver

1350
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,260
played at the hawks for the Atlanta
Hawks.

1351
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,120
And the,
uh,

1352
00:59:56,121 --> 01:00:01,121
the notion around the Muskogee is you do
something so hard one time a year that

1353
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:07,001
it has an impact the other 364 days of
the year on you that you go so far

1354
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,380
beyond.
You know,

1355
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:11,150
for me that was my hundred mile run.
I mean,

1356
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,100
I can look back since 2008.
I've had moments like that every year,

1357
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,370
but um,
though,

1358
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:22,640
and I believe in that,
I believe in that and um,

1359
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,370
in the widest brought that up.
But,

1360
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,690
but it's true.
And,

1361
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:29,840
um,
so it's just kind of one of the themes

1362
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,840
around this urgency and,
and you know,

1363
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:34,310
creating memories,
et cetera.

1364
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,850
You know,
I think there's things like that sort of

1365
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:41,630
highlight that urgency that if you just
live your life like at the same steady

1366
01:00:41,631 --> 01:00:46,631
static pace and maybe sometimes you
don't feel it as much,

1367
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:49,940
like,
like I'm sure after you did your hundred

1368
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,920
mile run,
like when it was over,

1369
01:00:51,921 --> 01:00:55,040
you probably,
it probably felt so good to relax.

1370
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:56,870
Ah,
well first of all,

1371
01:00:56,871 --> 01:00:58,580
for me,
the,

1372
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:03,680
the pressure around completing the run.
When I did the run,

1373
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:09,110
I raised millions of dollars for charity
and everyone in my world knew I was

1374
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:12,470
doing it.
I gave myself 90 days to train for.

1375
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:16,850
It isn't what's normal.
I would say like for the people in the

1376
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:19,130
shape that I was in going into it
probably a year,

1377
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,300
eight months,
six months.

1378
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,170
I mean,
whoa.

1379
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,420
I mean I gave myself 90 days.
I started in August and the,

1380
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:29,530
the race was 90 days later and uh,
everyone in my world was donating or

1381
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:34,670
involved or knew about it.
So if I didn't finish it,

1382
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,280
so much can go wrong in a hundred mile
run.

1383
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,290
You know,
like if something goes wrong in a

1384
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,240
marathon at mile 19,
you've got it out.

1385
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:43,040
You've got seven more miles,
you know,

1386
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:46,400
something goes wrong at Mile 1981 miles
left.

1387
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,830
You can't gut,
most people can't cut that out.

1388
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:53,600
I don't think I could.
I felt so relieved when it was done

1389
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,920
because I was just like,
man,

1390
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:57,500
I did it and no one can take it away
from me.

1391
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,800
What was the longest you would root rote
and not written?

1392
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,890
Uh,
ran before that I ran two 50s,

1393
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,170
two fifties to 50 milers.
I mean,

1394
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,170
I never did miles at a time,
so I did two 10 hour,

1395
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,820
10 hour runs twice and 50 miles in those
10 hours probably around there,

1396
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:14,923
somewhere around there.
So,

1397
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:19,830
but you knew that you were at the
halfway mark roughly and you could push

1398
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:22,710
through the rest?
I knew that if I got to 50 mile,

1399
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,220
if I could get to,
um,

1400
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:28,650
50 miles and 10 hours,
I could basically even injured walk the

1401
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:30,450
rest,
the allocated time.

1402
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,100
Now after that was over and after he did
do the 100 miles,

1403
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:40,440
how much of a shift did that make in the
way you thought about time and effort?

1404
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,800
Totally changed my life completely,
completely talking about this Miss Sogi,

1405
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,810
it completely changed my life.
That was in 2006.

1406
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:56,811
I think that I did the run and it's
completely changed my life because when

1407
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:01,140
I started running,
my goal was to run two miles.

1408
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,740
If I could run two miles in 18 minutes,
nine minute pace,

1409
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:08,220
I consider myself a runner and I work
towards that goal.

1410
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,420
Like out of college,
I was like,

1411
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:11,400
just got out of college.
I'm going to try to run two miles,

1412
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:13,760
you know,
like it took me a little to get there in

1413
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:17,070
[inaudible] nine minute pace.
And um,

1414
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:21,570
fast forward I ran this.
Nothing in my body changed,

1415
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,590
does the same legs.
God gave me same lugs God gave me.

1416
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,690
I'm not very strong,
nothing's changed.

1417
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:33,170
But I took that two mile body and ran a
hundred miles and I bet almost a lot of

1418
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:38,310
people that are listening this could run
two miles and with a gun to their head,

1419
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:40,050
they could run two miles that they had
to.

1420
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:45,590
And the only thing that changed was the
way I perceive what I thought I could do

1421
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:50,190
in this run.
And I realized after the race that Holy

1422
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,750
Shit,
I did 50 acts,

1423
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:57,140
what my initial goal was like I was
under indexing 50 x in this category of

1424
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:01,290
my life.
What are the areas of my life,

1425
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,120
Jesse?
What other areas of your life,

1426
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:05,970
man,
are you under indexing in like,

1427
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:09,060
okay,
if you're a sales quota at Marquis jet,

1428
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:13,320
my company was 20 jet cards.
Is that cause I knew I could get it and

1429
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:16,170
it was comfortable or should I be like
I'm putting you on the board for 40

1430
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:18,480
fellows this month.
Let me see what the fuck I can do.

1431
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,390
Right.
I was living in this like comfort.

1432
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:25,920
I was going through life like this
routine and routines are great,

1433
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:27,450
but routines can also be a Rut.

1434
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,360
You can't get better in a routine.
And if you get,

1435
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:32,520
so when you're in a routine,
time goes fast.

1436
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,220
When you're adding your routine time go
slow.

1437
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:37,710
So I was so comfortable in my routine.
It was like,

1438
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:38,250
man,
fuck it.

1439
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,690
I don't want to go through life like
this.

1440
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,150
I want to go through life like this.
You know?

1441
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:43,970
And I was,
people were listening.

1442
01:04:43,971 --> 01:04:45,490
You were going up.
I'm going to host.

1443
01:04:45,491 --> 01:04:46,410
People are listening.
Yeah.

1444
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,410
I'm sorry.
I'm scrolling fun.

1445
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,550
I'll do this all the time.
I'm just locked.

1446
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:51,960
I don't even know where people are
listening.

1447
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,340
Yeah,
I'm locked into you.

1448
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,660
I was going flat.
You know,

1449
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:59,640
I was just doing the same shit and I
want a nice 45 degree upward angle.

1450
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,391
Yeah.
So this,

1451
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:01,620
this run showed me,
man,

1452
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:05,340
I was under indexing so much what I
thought I was capable of and it made me

1453
01:05:05,341 --> 01:05:07,800
think like,
what else am I capable of?

1454
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,260
What about recovery?
Like what was it like when you were

1455
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:12,630
done?
Well,

1456
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:18,020
at Mile 94 I realized I had toenails in
my show.

1457
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:24,240
So that was an uncomfortable feeling.
And when I felt them felting rattle

1458
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:29,280
around and when I took my shoes off,
my feet were so fucked up.

1459
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:33,310
Is it because your feet swell while
you're running and you,

1460
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,060
if you have like a size 10,
you're supposed to swap out to a size 11

1461
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:38,140
later.
That's what works.

1462
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:39,850
I swapped,
I want to size up,

1463
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,920
but I blisters,
I bad blisters.

1464
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:46,950
My blisters were really bad and bad
before you ran or I got them as I was

1465
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:52,630
going and they look like it literally
looked like I had swallowed red grapes

1466
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,550
and they went to the bottom of each of
my toe.

1467
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:57,280
I mean,
it was just so I was in a wheelchair for

1468
01:05:57,281 --> 01:06:00,600
four days after the race,
four days just because of the bottom of

1469
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:03,910
the blisters and um,
you know,

1470
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,790
but so for me,
for me,

1471
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,410
it just like a regular guy.

1472
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,870
Um,
it was,

1473
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,180
it was a very powerful moment for me,
you know,

1474
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:14,560
and uh,
it was worth,

1475
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,600
it was worth it.
It was all well,

1476
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:17,560
well,
well worth it.

1477
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:19,660
Once I was done and I realize like,
I'm okay,

1478
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,080
I'm not in shock.
I'm not dehydrated.

1479
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:24,760
I'm just in super pain.
Um,

1480
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,480
that was a great moment and I have a
regret from that race.

1481
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,220
Like one of the biggest regrets in my
life.

1482
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:32,320
Like I don't like the way I finished the
race.

1483
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,720
I ran 99 miles the last mile,
took me 48 minutes and literally had to

1484
01:06:37,721 --> 01:06:41,320
like grab my shoulder,
my brothers shoulders and like I just,

1485
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,020
if I could do it all over,
I wanted to really finish that like a

1486
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:45,610
champion,
you know?

1487
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:48,550
And I was just very disappointed.
I'm very happy about it.

1488
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,490
But I also,
one of my biggest regrets from the race

1489
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:52,810
is just that,
you know,

1490
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,590
I got to that moment where,
and I just didn't finish it the way I

1491
01:06:56,591 --> 01:06:58,030
wanted to finish it,
what was wrong?

1492
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:02,110
Oh man,
my fucking joints like my hips and my

1493
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:07,111
knees were just like swollen,
just so much,

1494
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,180
just so much pain.
They were just,

1495
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:14,740
it was just so at 75 I felt,
I just kind of like was running and then

1496
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:18,440
all a sudden I was on the ground because
like I just buckled because it was,

1497
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,380
it was my joints,
not my muscles,

1498
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:21,870
just like my,
you know,

1499
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,691
like I said,
if you,

1500
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:25,840
if you roll your thumb around for 24
hours,

1501
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,960
your thumb's gonna fall off.
You know,

1502
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,010
it's this the stop motion and pounding
and,

1503
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,140
and,
and I didn't know what I was wearing

1504
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:33,100
cotton.
I was like,

1505
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,550
I did everything wrong,
you know,

1506
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:35,913
but I did it.

1507
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:41,770
And when you did get done with that and
the wheelchair for four days,

1508
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:44,140
how long did it take before your body
felt normal?

1509
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:49,141
Like your joints normalized your hips
and your knees and took about two over a

1510
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,520
little over two weeks.
Wow.

1511
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,790
Yeah.
So you just hobbling around for two

1512
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:57,760
weeks thinking about it.
I'm still impacted by it really?

1513
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,030
How so?
I like a huge cyst,

1514
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:04,270
like from all the stress on my,
on my foot that,

1515
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:08,080
um,
I've had like a ham sized,

1516
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,520
when you say it,
you're like,

1517
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:10,350
fuck,
you're holding.

1518
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:14,170
You see like you have a skull on?
Like how big was it?

1519
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,040
Like big enough.
I couldn't wear shoes.

1520
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,440
Why don't I wear sneakers that like,
yeah,

1521
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,150
it was,
I'll show you a picture.

1522
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:24,440
I got a drain twice and then I went to
like a real,

1523
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:26,570
like a almost fruitarian diet and went
away.

1524
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:30,350
Fruitarians just all fruit.
Why did that do it?

1525
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:32,750
I uh,
I don't know.

1526
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:33,930
I,
yeah,

1527
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:37,370
I used to try fruits with vegetables or
fruits with anything else.

1528
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,120
So for 27 years I've only had fruit till
12 o'clock noon.

1529
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,360
That's all I eat in the morning.
But I extended that out further and it

1530
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:50,150
went away on its own from fruit.
I don't know if that's the reason.

1531
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,600
Maybe over a month just went away.
Um,

1532
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,120
but I made some significant changes in
my diet.

1533
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,790
Yeah.
So what,

1534
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:01,730
but what led you to be the fruitarian
idea?

1535
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,880
Uh,
I read a book called fit for life when I

1536
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:06,020
was 20.
Right.

1537
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:08,630
For my first marathon,
I was 21 or 22 years old.

1538
01:09:08,631 --> 01:09:13,040
Like looking for an edge.
And in the book it challenges the reader

1539
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:14,660
to,
uh,

1540
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,360
try to eat.
One of the principles of the book is to

1541
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,460
only fruit until noon and we can talk
about it,

1542
01:09:19,461 --> 01:09:20,294
but,
uh,

1543
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:23,230
it challenges the reader to try it for
10 days and then day 11,

1544
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,400
go back to regular breakfast and see how
you feel.

1545
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,370
So I did like,
I can invest 10 days to try this.

1546
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,490
And on day 11,
I went back to oatmeal and toast or

1547
01:09:31,491 --> 01:09:33,740
whatever and I was like,
oh my God,

1548
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:37,460
man,
I felt so sluggish and like bloated and

1549
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:39,110
I was like,
I never went back.

1550
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,760
And it's,
and that,

1551
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:43,610
that's unwavering.
I'm unwavering on that.

1552
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:47,450
I've run marathon and never changes
fruit until noon.

1553
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,790
And um,
so that's why now what are these people

1554
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:56,720
eat in the monastery?
So they have a very light breakfast that

1555
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:57,554
suited me.
Well,

1556
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,410
they have fruit in the morning and then
their lunch,

1557
01:10:00,411 --> 01:10:02,060
they called dinner,
that's their big meal.

1558
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:06,350
So the afternoon,
noon meal was sup is like dinner and

1559
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:09,610
then at night it was super light,
like soup and salad or whatever it is

1560
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,170
really like almost one meal a day.
Are they vegetarian?

1561
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,161
Uh,
somewhere,

1562
01:10:13,161 --> 01:10:15,470
but others weren't.
That's interest.

1563
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:16,930
Not all of them were,
which was,

1564
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:19,100
which was interesting.
Did you expect them to be?

1565
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,220
I did.
I lost a lot of weight there.

1566
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:24,320
I lost like 17 pounds.
15,

1567
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,110
17 pounds.
Yeah.

1568
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,090
Weeks.
Yeah.

1569
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:28,400
Why so what do you think it's lack of
sugar?

1570
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,830
No carbs.
Lack of sugar.

1571
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:34,400
One meal a day.
They don't eat any bread or they did.

1572
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:38,900
I didn't,
I wanted to put a little asterisk next

1573
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,560
to my thing.
I went,

1574
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,020
I went in there saying to myself,
I didn't want to have,

1575
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:45,980
I wanted to come back clean.
So I really try not to have any grains.

1576
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,050
And I did have some grains,
but not,

1577
01:10:48,051 --> 01:10:49,700
not a lot.
And I walked a lot.

1578
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:53,570
I walked 120 miles over the,
over the time I was there up and down

1579
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:55,530
the driveway.
And uh,

1580
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,050
so I lost a lot of us,
a lot of weight.

1581
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:00,290
I gained it all back,
but at the time,

1582
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:03,680
yeah.
Now these people that live this life,

1583
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,950
do they have something they're working
towards?

1584
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,200
Do they have an idea that they're
working towards?

1585
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,840
Does it mean when you,
when you press them on it and ask them

1586
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:12,531
like,
why are you here?

1587
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:15,240
Do you ever plan on leaving?
Do you ever see yourself going somewhere

1588
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:16,620
else?
That's a really good question.

1589
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:18,210
I asked them all those questions.
So,

1590
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,270
uh,
no.

1591
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:22,350
They felt like that was their calling,
their calling.

1592
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,180
They were doing what they were supposed
to be doing and um,

1593
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,270
that they were committed to that
lifestyle.

1594
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,890
So no,
they weren't,

1595
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:36,930
there was no thought of going back.
There had been monks that have left the

1596
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:38,940
monastery,
just wasn't the right lifestyle for

1597
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:41,580
them.
But the monks that were there when I was

1598
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:42,890
there,
you know,

1599
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:46,530
50 years they were committed and they're
not going anywhere.

1600
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,770
When you say that's what's confusing to
me,

1601
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:52,380
like I understand that they're enjoying
and I understand that they're,

1602
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,540
they,
they liked that life,

1603
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:59,520
but that it's a calling,
like the calling to do nothing or just

1604
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:04,110
think maybe it's just sacrifice.
Serve God,

1605
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,410
um,
live a life of purity.

1606
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,600
This is not right.
I understand.

1607
01:12:09,601 --> 01:12:12,390
I couldn't do it,
but I think that's kind of the mindset

1608
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,250
around it.
And,

1609
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:17,370
um,
step away from

1610
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:23,400
the regular life that they were living.
What's interesting is that they weren't

1611
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:24,990
born into the monastery,
right?

1612
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,500
A lot of these guys made this decision
in their twenties,

1613
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,790
thirties,
you know,

1614
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:33,150
so what were their jobs before they did
it all over the board,

1615
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,460
all over the board.
Literally,

1616
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,740
uh,
one guy,

1617
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,900
I mean,
one of the most of the lifeguard as a

1618
01:12:39,901 --> 01:12:41,220
teenager.
Wow.

1619
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:43,080
I mean,
just all over the board.

1620
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,560
So,
um,

1621
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:49,050
but regular jobs just always felt
connected to God and connected to this

1622
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,110
higher living a life just,
you know,

1623
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,580
under these terms.

1624
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,840
But what's fascinating to me is that
you're saying that there was so happy

1625
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,430
because if you get a rent,
I mean,

1626
01:12:59,431 --> 01:13:01,320
how many,
how many people were in this monastery?

1627
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,270
Uh,
eight and they're all male.

1628
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,740
Yes.
Eight men.

1629
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,010
If you get eight random men in there,
you know,

1630
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:13,100
what's the young stage of the guys?
35 35 up to 70 you get eight random 35

1631
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:17,190
to 70 is now is how many of them are
happy?

1632
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:20,430
Actually truly happy,
maybe too,

1633
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,280
right?
How many people do you think are happy?

1634
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:25,560
Well,
they just did a study as a famous Harris

1635
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:30,561
study on happiness in this country.
I think 67% of people are unhappy that

1636
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:33,630
it's fucked.
Here's what here I did this jail,

1637
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:34,860
you'll,
this is a good test.

1638
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:37,830
Maybe you'll want to do this.
I did this when I was speaking at an

1639
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:42,540
event for 500 Wall Street people
recently and it was fascinating.

1640
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:44,760
I'll take you through it.
You can tell me if you're comfortable

1641
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:47,010
with it,
but if you take all the areas of your

1642
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:49,170
life and put them in a blender,
okay,

1643
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,630
so take a,
where you live,

1644
01:13:51,631 --> 01:13:53,400
your relationships,
your finances,

1645
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:54,870
your health,
everything,

1646
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:58,200
everything.
Put it in one fucking big blender and

1647
01:13:58,201 --> 01:14:01,380
blend it up.
And on a scale of one to 10 with 10

1648
01:14:01,381 --> 01:14:06,381
being the Dalai Lama of happiness and a
one being a guidance at rock was zero

1649
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:10,200
being some of us at rock bottom.
What your happiness number

1650
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,950
me?
Yeah,

1651
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,710
I'm pretty fucking happy.
Well I don't know.

1652
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:17,440
I wouldn't do it that way.
I definitely wouldn't give it a number.

1653
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,000
Okay.
Cause I feel like that you're,

1654
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:21,620
you're making something,
you're,

1655
01:14:21,621 --> 01:14:23,290
you're turning like

1656
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:28,810
a constant state of thinking and
expression and consideration.

1657
01:14:31,131 --> 01:14:34,000
You're turning it into a number and I
just,

1658
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:37,460
I don't like that idea.
I don't like that idea because I think

1659
01:14:37,461 --> 01:14:40,880
it's a management issue.
I think a lot of what happiness is a

1660
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:44,360
management issue and decisions that
you're making right now.

1661
01:14:44,361 --> 01:14:46,940
Like you could be in a shit state of
mind right now,

1662
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:51,860
but you can make some decisions to
adjust that and over the next couple

1663
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:56,360
hours you'll get to a much better place.
And these constant management decisions,

1664
01:14:56,361 --> 01:14:58,820
they waver in and out of your life on a
daily basis.

1665
01:14:58,821 --> 01:15:00,640
Like this idea that you could have a
good mindset,

1666
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,050
then all of a sudden you'll be happy.
That's horse shit.

1667
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:06,110
Like it's that's like,
it's like the tide,

1668
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:09,680
it comes in and it comes out and there's
going to be days where you're just not

1669
01:15:09,681 --> 01:15:13,100
feeling so good physically and that's
going to affect the way your happiness

1670
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:15,050
level is.
It's never static.

1671
01:15:15,051 --> 01:15:16,970
It's never the exactly the same.
True.

1672
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,200
But if you look at it overall at 30,000
feet and you had to give yourself a

1673
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:23,330
grade,
he's happy as fuck is what I would say.

1674
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,130
Happy.
Okay.

1675
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:27,920
So I'll take that.
I'll take that.

1676
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,170
Most people in that room,
yeah,

1677
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:32,900
raised there.
I said if anyone is seven and you know

1678
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,760
for anyone that listening that wants to
do it,

1679
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:37,170
raise your hand if you're,
you know,

1680
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:39,950
seven or below.
I don't want to put anyone on the spot.

1681
01:15:39,951 --> 01:15:42,130
And majority of the room stood up.
Right.

1682
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:45,170
Being a seven and thinking,
you know like seven's pretty happy

1683
01:15:45,171 --> 01:15:50,171
number but a seven if my son comes home
with a 70 on a test to see minus.

1684
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:55,550
Right.
And all I'm saying is,

1685
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,440
but what was interesting about the test
though,

1686
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,680
if you do actually go through the
process for those that like go through

1687
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:02,340
and get a number in their head or
whatever,

1688
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:03,830
do you want to give their self a grade?

1689
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:08,660
Your brain automatically goes to a 10
and then subtracts the two or three

1690
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:11,360
things pop in that make you better bring
you happiness down.

1691
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:15,650
It's a great way to identify what's
making you unhappy and that,

1692
01:16:15,651 --> 01:16:17,630
you know what I mean?
Like it started at 10 you're like,

1693
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:22,130
oh fuck my relationship or this or that.
Usually it triggers an automatic,

1694
01:16:22,131 --> 01:16:24,560
like this is what's fucked up in my life
response,

1695
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,960
and you can,
it helps you identify,

1696
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:30,800
but it's interesting.
We have benchmarks and so many things in

1697
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,330
our life.
You have an Iq test,

1698
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,340
you have tax brackets to measure your,
your wealth or financial statements.

1699
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:39,140
You have Iq tests.
Like I said,

1700
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:40,910
you can get on a scale to measure your
weight,

1701
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,130
but you're right.
Happiness is one of those things.

1702
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:46,470
It's like how do you benchmark it?
You know what I mean?

1703
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,610
It kind of fluctuates.

1704
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:49,200
It's like hunger.
I mean it's,

1705
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:49,711
it's,
it's,

1706
01:16:49,711 --> 01:16:51,630
it's something that's go,
it goes in and out.

1707
01:16:51,631 --> 01:16:53,790
It's always there.
But happy as fuck is a,

1708
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,440
is a good answer.
But I,

1709
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:00,480
this is something I've cultivated for a
long time and avoided things that make

1710
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:05,520
me unhappy and figured out what those
things are and been very rigid about

1711
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:09,180
eliminating them from my life.
And one of the big ones is

1712
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:13,070
interactions with people that are
negative.

1713
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:15,190
That is gigantic.
And B,

1714
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:20,180
because I realized that I'm not really
as independent as I used to,

1715
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:22,880
like to think I was,
I used to like to think that my thought

1716
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:26,270
process was independent and that I don't
give a fuck what anybody thinks.

1717
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:30,560
That's nonsense.
People say that because they absolutely

1718
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:32,690
care what people think and it bothers
them.

1719
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:34,490
So they say,
I don't give a fuck,

1720
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:35,900
but that I don't give a fuck.

1721
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:40,640
Stuff is almost entirely nonsense.
You do care and you care in both ways.

1722
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:43,820
You care if people critical of you've
care if people are positive you,

1723
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:49,060
but you also care if people are living
positive lives and they're motivating

1724
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:50,300
you.
That's,

1725
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:53,390
that's a big one.
People are fuel and other people.

1726
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,280
It's one of the reasons why I like
talking to people.

1727
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:58,070
One of the reasons why I like to do
podcasts because I get a lot out of,

1728
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,960
you know,
like just talking to you about your time

1729
01:17:59,961 --> 01:18:03,380
in the monastery or you're,
you're pushed to get to that hundred

1730
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,170
miles.
Like you get energy out of people like

1731
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:10,220
that and you think about this energy and
you think about this inspiration when

1732
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:14,630
you're doing other things.
And it also sets in your mind that when

1733
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:16,760
you meet these exceptional people that
move you,

1734
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:20,330
like what are the characters?
What are the qualities that they have?

1735
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:22,970
What are the characteristics that they,
that they possess?

1736
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:26,210
And those things become significant and
important to you.

1737
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:30,620
Whereas if you live around a bunch of
people that are complaining and bitching

1738
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:33,560
about everything and they see the
negative in everything and they're

1739
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:38,210
always whining,
those people are the opposite of that.

1740
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,240
They're the opposite of inspiration and
they're,

1741
01:18:40,241 --> 01:18:42,890
they're just there.
They're mud and you're just like,

1742
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:45,290
whoa.
It's like you're up to your ankles and

1743
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,820
bud,
you try to trudge through life.

1744
01:18:46,821 --> 01:18:48,380
It's difficult.
You're not light.

1745
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,680
It's not,
it's not pushing it.

1746
01:18:50,681 --> 01:18:53,180
It's not a wind at your back,
the winds in your face.

1747
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:54,740
And it's rough,
you know?

1748
01:18:54,741 --> 01:18:59,741
And over time I've learned that these
people,

1749
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:02,240
you just,
you're not going to fix him.

1750
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,920
I used to want to fix someone.
I was young,

1751
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:04,910
I used to want to go,
hey man,

1752
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:05,744
I see what you're doing.

1753
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,291
Like,
dude,

1754
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:07,370
don't do that anymore.
Listen,

1755
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:08,400
just try it.
Just,

1756
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,780
just do this and,
and stop doing that and start doing

1757
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:13,280
this.
And if you just work towards this,

1758
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:16,610
you could be successful.
And then a week later the guys doing the

1759
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:17,630
same shit and you're like,
okay,

1760
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:21,410
I'm wasting a significant amount of my
energy on someone who doesn't want to

1761
01:19:21,411 --> 01:19:26,411
waste any of their energy on themselves.
And so managing the,

1762
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:29,270
the community and the tribe that you're
in,

1763
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,090
making sure that you're a good member of
that tribe,

1764
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,000
that your doing your part,
you know?

1765
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:40,001
And there's a lot of cynicism in these
days about inspiration and about

1766
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:44,420
motivation because there's a lot of fake
shit.

1767
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:47,180
You know,
you can go on instagram and you see a

1768
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:51,830
million of these inspirational quote
pages and there were run by people that

1769
01:19:51,831 --> 01:19:53,330
are probably depressed.
You know,

1770
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:55,070
you see a lot of people that are,
you know,

1771
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:58,850
talking about how to get ahead in life,
but they're not really doing anything

1772
01:19:58,851 --> 01:19:59,684
themselves.

1773
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,820
So there's a lot of cynicism involved in
that.

1774
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,960
But there's also sincerity in it and you
can get,

1775
01:20:05,961 --> 01:20:09,150
if you just look at it with a pure heart
and a pure mind,

1776
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:14,180
you can get a lot of energy out of that.
And when you're around happy,

1777
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:17,580
inspirational people that are
successful,

1778
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:21,060
it makes you feel better and you get
inspired.

1779
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,020
And if you act on that inspiration,
your life will be more fulfilled.

1780
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:28,110
And it's not just inspirational in terms
of financial success,

1781
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:31,920
but in terms of doing difficult things,
whether it's running a hundred miles,

1782
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:34,470
it doesn't pay you a God damn thing
other than the the,

1783
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:39,530
the wealth of the knowledge that you can
push yourself to such an extreme or

1784
01:20:39,721 --> 01:20:41,510
anything else.
Whether it's someone who becomes a

1785
01:20:41,511 --> 01:20:44,970
really good at playing chess or someone
who's really good at martial arts or,

1786
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,470
or whatever it is,
there's,

1787
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:51,150
there's a great feeling in these
overcoming these difficult things

1788
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:56,151
because life is never this just constant
state of I'm at a nine all day and when

1789
01:20:57,031 --> 01:20:59,640
I'm with my wife,
I hit 10 Yay.

1790
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,100
And I stay like that.
That's not real.

1791
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:07,280
What's real is like you saying that you
went to this monastery and felt all

1792
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:13,860
this,
this angsty about meditating and being

1793
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:16,860
alone and not having your phone and not
having the input.

1794
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:19,950
But then when it comes out of it,
then you have this reward.

1795
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:23,040
So you,
you pushed through this and you had

1796
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:26,760
these uncomfortable feelings and you
came out of those uncomfortable feelings

1797
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:31,910
with this new found appreciation for
time and this new found respect for your

1798
01:21:32,011 --> 01:21:36,120
own existence in your own space and
carving out three hours for yourself a

1799
01:21:36,121 --> 01:21:38,310
day.
That's where it all comes from.

1800
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:43,311
It all comes from life lessons and the
lessons are learned through struggle and

1801
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:46,380
I think that there's a lot of people out
there that thinks somehow or another

1802
01:21:46,381 --> 01:21:49,050
you're going to get to some place where
you're living in silk sheets and you get

1803
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:52,170
your toes done while someone's dropping
grapes into your mouth.

1804
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,690
I don't want that.
I've never wanted that.

1805
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,660
That guy's not going to be happy.
It's going to be bored our into the

1806
01:21:57,661 --> 01:21:59,760
grapes.
You can we get those fucking grapes away

1807
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:02,040
from me.
Stop painting my toes.

1808
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,710
What am I doing in this bed?
I got to do something.

1809
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:07,650
I'm not stimulated.
The human organism,

1810
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:12,510
the animal that we are needs constant
stimulation because it evolved.

1811
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:16,530
Trying to find food and escape enemies
and find shelter,

1812
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:18,840
escape nature,
escape the elements,

1813
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:22,500
try to survive.
And this is the great joy that you

1814
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:25,710
haven't taken care of your children,
that you can protect your children from

1815
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:28,110
the elements and the enemies and feed
them and,

1816
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,140
and it's also the great sadness that you
see in losers.

1817
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,450
When I see a loser,
I see some guys,

1818
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:36,660
43 years old,
lives in his parents' basement and he

1819
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:38,190
fucking hates the world.
I'm like,

1820
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,130
that was a baby man.

1821
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:43,980
This is a baby that somebody just gave
shitty nutrients to.

1822
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,990
Whether its nutrients in the forms of
food or in the form of thoughts and

1823
01:22:48,991 --> 01:22:53,991
ideas and examples and this kid develop
these horrible self defeating patterns

1824
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:59,460
of behavior that have led them to this
point where they're this,

1825
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:04,590
this middle aged person with no future
and no idea of how to get out of this

1826
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:06,910
Rut,
probably never will escape it and might

1827
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:09,220
just wind up sucking on a gun.
You know what I mean?

1828
01:23:09,221 --> 01:23:11,290
This is,
this is the world that we live in today

1829
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:15,370
and I think part of that world is
because we have been fed this line of

1830
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:19,450
Horse Shit that you're supposed to seek
comfort and I don't think you are.

1831
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:23,980
I think you're supposed to seek lessons
and you supposed to seek difficult tasks

1832
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:24,980
and and,
and,

1833
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:29,110
and accomplishments and through those
things and through doing things that are

1834
01:23:29,111 --> 01:23:31,300
hard to do,
even if it's just a fucking 90 minute

1835
01:23:31,301 --> 01:23:34,240
hot yoga class,
I do a 90 minute yoga class,

1836
01:23:34,241 --> 01:23:34,450
man.

1837
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,710
I,
those last 20 minutes,

1838
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:39,700
I do not want to be there man.
And I definitely don't want to give 100%

1839
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:41,140
and I can cheat.
I can,

1840
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,000
I could kind of have acid.
I can,

1841
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:46,390
I can,
but if I don't and I get through it,

1842
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,110
when that time is up and the lady says
Namaz Day and everybody gets up,

1843
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:51,130
I'm like,
fuck man,

1844
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:52,390
I made it,
you know,

1845
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:55,580
I lost 15 pounds.
My fucking Yoga Mat is drenched to the

1846
01:23:55,581 --> 01:23:59,770
point where I can literally wring it out
and fill up a jug up with water.

1847
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,300
But through that struggle,
I will now have a better day and I

1848
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:08,230
better fucking do it again tomorrow or
do something else because if I just

1849
01:24:08,231 --> 01:24:09,790
think,
well tomorrow I'm just going to coast

1850
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:11,980
and eat twinkies and watch TV.
Oh,

1851
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:13,810
hello sadness,
my old friend.

1852
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:16,360
Hello Depression.
Because when you're not doing anything

1853
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:19,990
you feel like shit and that's just part
of being a human being and we can

1854
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:23,090
pretend that we're something other than
what we really are and we can pretend

1855
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:23,860
not me,
man.

1856
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,210
I'm just cool.
Just chilling,

1857
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,950
doing nothing.
Bullshit.

1858
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,140
You're a fucking human.
You're a human being.

1859
01:24:29,141 --> 01:24:32,830
You,
you evolve from the fucking hundreds and

1860
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:34,600
thousands of years of hunters and
gatherers and people that were

1861
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:37,600
struggling.
Those real human reward systems are

1862
01:24:37,601 --> 01:24:41,290
carved deeply into your DNA.
And if you don't respect that,

1863
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:45,640
if you don't respect the mechanism of
happiness and fulfillment and what you

1864
01:24:45,641 --> 01:24:48,670
really need to do in order to feel
satisfied in life,

1865
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:51,220
camaraderie,
love,

1866
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,080
family,
friendship,

1867
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,450
struggle,
testing yourself,

1868
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:58,630
learning,
all those things are imperative.

1869
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,640
They're all a giant part of being a
person.

1870
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:03,370
I love it.
That was amazing.

1871
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:05,440
And I,
I'm thinking in my head and my checking

1872
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:08,890
those boxes as you're talking and in my
living my life like that,

1873
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,450
you know?
And uh,

1874
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:11,890
yeah,
I agree with you.

1875
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,180
It sounds like you are.
I am.

1876
01:25:13,181 --> 01:25:13,511
Yeah.
No,

1877
01:25:13,511 --> 01:25:14,170
I feel like,
oh,

1878
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:14,831
waiver,
right.

1879
01:25:14,831 --> 01:25:16,930
We all have days in and days out.

1880
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,420
Absolutely.
But to be reinforced.

1881
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:21,300
Yup.
And I'm a,

1882
01:25:21,301 --> 01:25:22,270
I feel like,
you know,

1883
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:24,850
as I'm listening to you talk about that,
I'm literally going through like the

1884
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:26,590
last 10 years of my life,
you know?

1885
01:25:26,591 --> 01:25:29,230
And when I live with David,
when I went on the modest as all of

1886
01:25:29,231 --> 01:25:30,500
these things,
um,

1887
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:32,920
they're all about getting an edge and
doing what you,

1888
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:33,970
you know,
and it is,

1889
01:25:33,971 --> 01:25:36,040
it's,
I think it's like part of being human

1890
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:39,190
and that stuff makes me feel most the
most alive too.

1891
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:42,880
You know?
Like it just makes me feel alive.

1892
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,800
Yeah.
You know,

1893
01:25:44,801 --> 01:25:47,950
and also like little improvements over
things.

1894
01:25:47,951 --> 01:25:50,560
It's why doing difficult things as good,
whether it's running.

1895
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:54,370
So like if you're running and you run,
you could run two miles and then one day

1896
01:25:54,371 --> 01:25:57,070
you get it up to three.
So like fuck,

1897
01:25:57,071 --> 01:26:01,600
I remember when I struggled with too,
now I can do for little improvements,

1898
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,820
you know,
and you really that in yoga class and in

1899
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:07,220
particular for me because I'm not good
at it,

1900
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,880
you know,
so when I do a yoga class and I can hold

1901
01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:14,300
a pose until the night,
you know like you're holding these pose

1902
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:17,030
for a minute and if you could stand on
one foot,

1903
01:26:17,031 --> 01:26:19,880
grabbing your other foot,
lifting it above your head and keep your

1904
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:23,540
arm out straight and your balance and
your foot's on fire and your core is

1905
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:24,080
engaged.

1906
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,490
But if you can get to the point where
they say stop you,

1907
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,690
you've,
you feel like,

1908
01:26:29,691 --> 01:26:31,640
wow,
I didn't used to be able to do that.

1909
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:34,950
I used to be able to hold it for 10
seconds and I would fall down and then

1910
01:26:34,951 --> 01:26:37,430
I'd have to start all over again.
Start from scratch.

1911
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:40,730
There's little improvements.
Will you feel yourself getting a little

1912
01:26:40,731 --> 01:26:44,060
better at something,
whether it's Jujitsu or anything else,

1913
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,940
little improvements I think or what life
is all about.

1914
01:26:46,941 --> 01:26:51,941
And I think also there,
there are a tool to feed the mind cause

1915
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:54,990
I really believe the mind needs these
little lessons.

1916
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,460
The mind needs these little,
these little tasks.

1917
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:00,350
And if you,
your brain doesn't get that,

1918
01:27:00,351 --> 01:27:03,590
I think it atrophies and it gets
depressed and it's like,

1919
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,560
it's like,
I think that's half of what a lot of

1920
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:11,561
people's sadness is,
is this lack of stimulation and reward,

1921
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,810
lack of these peaks and valleys.
And this again,

1922
01:27:14,811 --> 01:27:17,900
this bullshit idea that we're constantly
fed,

1923
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:19,190
that you should be comfortable.

1924
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:20,820
It's so true.
I mean,

1925
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,380
when,
when Goggins live with me,

1926
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,050
his rule is we had to do something
everyday that sucked.

1927
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,680
That was his role.
And he's the master at that Shit.

1928
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,260
Tell me about it.
And when did he make you do?

1929
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:34,380
Uh,
everyday sucked.

1930
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,620
He didn't tell me that we're going to do
that five times a day.

1931
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:38,663
That what,
you know?

1932
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,870
Um,
no.

1933
01:27:39,871 --> 01:27:41,790
I mean,
I remember one day Bob was,

1934
01:27:41,791 --> 01:27:44,790
the first thing we did was we,
he came in and he um,

1935
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,330
he wanted to see how many pull ups I
could do so we can map out the month.

1936
01:27:48,331 --> 01:27:52,380
He lived with me for a month and I went
to the pull up bar and I got like maybe

1937
01:27:52,381 --> 01:27:54,630
eight pull ups,
which is an exaggeration.

1938
01:27:54,631 --> 01:27:58,830
I'm probably got like four pull ups.
A lot of people are listening.

1939
01:27:58,831 --> 01:28:01,430
So
uh,

1940
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,850
and then he said,
I wait 30 seconds,

1941
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:03,743
go and do it again.

1942
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:07,590
And I went up on the pull up bar and I
did maybe like three or four.

1943
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:08,640
He said,
I wait 30 seconds,

1944
01:28:08,641 --> 01:28:11,760
I want you to do it again.
And I got up on the pull up bar and I

1945
01:28:11,761 --> 01:28:13,980
did maybe like one kipping,
you know,

1946
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:16,200
getting my damn chin over the bar and
barely,

1947
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,240
and I dropped down.
It was all jacked up and I said,

1948
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:19,331
all right,
well what's,

1949
01:28:19,331 --> 01:28:20,280
what's next?
He said,

1950
01:28:20,281 --> 01:28:21,720
well,
what's next is we're not leaving here

1951
01:28:21,721 --> 01:28:24,350
until you do a hundred more.
We're not leaving the gym until you do

1952
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:26,640
100 more that day.
Now,

1953
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:27,960
like right now,
right now.

1954
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:31,950
So you and I was like seven.
I did like probably seven or 10.

1955
01:28:31,951 --> 01:28:32,820
And I was like,
man,

1956
01:28:32,821 --> 01:28:35,310
God knows that's impossible.
And he said,

1957
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:35,970
you know,
I already,

1958
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:38,910
I already know what your biggest problem
is and he's just like the limitations

1959
01:28:38,911 --> 01:28:41,040
you're putting on yourself or are self
imposed,

1960
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:42,330
get the fuck back on the bar.

1961
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:46,800
And you know,
Roger that then and uh,

1962
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:50,400
I got up on the bar and I all over over
the course of an hour or two,

1963
01:28:50,401 --> 01:28:53,640
I did them.
And that started our journey of like,

1964
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:56,370
you're about to go in a place where
you've never been motherfucker,

1965
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,800
you know,
and you know,

1966
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:00,990
we went,
I remember one day I was sitting on

1967
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:04,560
couch and uh,
in Connecticut where I was living at the

1968
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:06,150
time and on the ticker,
on the,

1969
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,700
on the TV,
the emergency broadcast system came up,

1970
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:12,660
stay inside freezing rain,
icy conditions,

1971
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:14,910
high winds stay inside.
It's like beeping,

1972
01:29:14,911 --> 01:29:17,220
stay inside.
And Gaga was like,

1973
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:19,050
this is amazing.
Now let's go for a run.

1974
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:24,960
And I'm like,
they're telling us the exact opposite.

1975
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,750
They're there,
they're broadcasting to the whole

1976
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:31,410
community to stay inside.
So we go for a 10 mile run in the

1977
01:29:31,411 --> 01:29:35,220
blizzard and we'd come home and I lived
on a lake and kids are playing hockey on

1978
01:29:35,221 --> 01:29:37,830
the lake.
So we go down and he takes his hand and

1979
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:42,180
he moves all the snow off the ice.
It gets a boulder and he breaks the ice,

1980
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:43,680
a little hole in the ice with the
boulder.

1981
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:46,260
And then he takes his hand and he mixed
the whole little bit bigger.

1982
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,460
And then he jumps in and then he points
at me and he takes his finger and he's

1983
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:54,330
singles for me to jump in.
I'm not going in the fucking freezing

1984
01:29:54,331 --> 01:29:57,690
cold water because my mother told me as
a kid in long island,

1985
01:29:57,691 --> 01:30:00,450
don't go anywhere near the frozen where
if you fall in,

1986
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:01,530
you have like a minute,
you know,

1987
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,700
he's bathing in it.

1988
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,530
So of course I go in and,
uh,

1989
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,321
he looks at me,
he's like,

1990
01:30:07,321 --> 01:30:08,280
man,
you got about,

1991
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:10,660
uh,
about four to two to four minutes.

1992
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:12,360
You're gonna get hypothermia.
We just went on to run.

1993
01:30:12,361 --> 01:30:15,870
We got to get you out of the lake and I
go to get ad,

1994
01:30:15,871 --> 01:30:16,770
he goes,
you can't get out.

1995
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:18,930
He goes,
if your skin touches the ice,

1996
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:22,140
it's going to stick to the ice.
Like the kid in Christmas story is Tang

1997
01:30:22,141 --> 01:30:23,550
that sticks to the pole,
you know,

1998
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:28,551
so he puts my shoes back on my hands and
picks my ass up and puts my sock.

1999
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:31,890
I put my socks on or whatever and I,
I could bear crawl out of the ice and I

2000
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:36,480
run up and I see my wife looking out the
window as I'm running into the house and

2001
01:30:36,481 --> 01:30:39,480
we come in and she says to Goggins,
you know,

2002
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:41,310
like,
what's the medical benefit of jumping in

2003
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:43,440
a frozen lake?
And he said to her,

2004
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:45,120
there's no medical benefit,
was like,

2005
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:47,400
this is what your husband signed up for.
You know,

2006
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:48,960
he's like,
I want to see how far he's willing to go

2007
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:51,390
to get to his goals.
And I was like,

2008
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:53,610
fuck,
this is going to be some 30 days.

2009
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:57,870
Jesus.
Wow.

2010
01:30:57,871 --> 01:30:59,460
What was the toughest thing you made you
do?

2011
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:02,640
Uh,
it was just the consistency of it.

2012
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:03,750
You know,
it was just like,

2013
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:06,410
it was just like,
it was just really,

2014
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:07,740
he,
she went everywhere I went.

2015
01:31:07,741 --> 01:31:10,860
He shadowed me for 30 days.
He went to every business meeting,

2016
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:12,790
we flew together.
He lived with,

2017
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:13,681
you know,
with my wife.

2018
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:17,340
And I did just think like,
what the fuck did I sign up for?

2019
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:20,730
And this is back in 2010 so this is,
uh,

2020
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:22,380
you know,
um,

2021
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,760
yes,
I did.

2022
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:25,920
I was,
and the book came out two years ago.

2023
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:26,430
No,
I can't,

2024
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,660
yeah,
I waited five years.

2025
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,823
I didn't,
I didn't,

2026
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:31,260
you know,
and expect it to ever be a book.

2027
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:32,640
It was just like,
you know,

2028
01:31:32,641 --> 01:31:35,170
at all,
there was no book being discussed.

2029
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:37,740
I kept a little blog about it,
you know,

2030
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:40,620
so why'd you do it?
Um,

2031
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:43,320
I just felt like there was so much in
it.

2032
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:47,340
There's so many lessons and it was funny
fish out of water.

2033
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:50,220
Like he's coming into our house.
My wife owns spanx.

2034
01:31:50,221 --> 01:31:52,770
I mean,
like the dual dynamic of this shit was

2035
01:31:52,771 --> 01:31:54,690
crazy.
And,

2036
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:57,300
um,
I just felt there were a lot of lessons

2037
01:31:57,301 --> 01:31:59,260
that could be learned through it.
And,

2038
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:00,094
um,

2039
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,240
you know,
I just took a shot at it.

2040
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:02,830
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

2041
01:32:02,831 --> 01:32:03,790
He's a maniac.
When,

2042
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:06,100
when he did the podcast,
I got here,

2043
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:10,090
he showed up super early and when I got
here he was already with his shirt off

2044
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:12,880
doing chin ups
and I was like,

2045
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:15,780
I walked into the back where the gym is
and he's,

2046
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:18,400
he's in there.
I'm like,

2047
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:20,560
look at this mother fucker.
Amazing.

2048
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,000
I he's a savage.
Yeah,

2049
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:24,310
he's legit.
But these are all the lessons,

2050
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:25,570
you know,
like as you're talking about,

2051
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:26,920
you know,
and you don't know where the nuggets

2052
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:30,520
come from.
You put yourself in a position for the

2053
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:33,700
nuggets to appear and they don't have to
be radical positions.

2054
01:32:33,701 --> 01:32:35,010
Like,
I'm going to go get gigatons,

2055
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:37,270
I'm going to go live with a ma.
Be Radical.

2056
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,370
But you put yourself out there like you
were saying,

2057
01:32:39,371 --> 01:32:41,830
and you live a life with those lessons
find you.

2058
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,880
Yeah.
And then,

2059
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,110
and seek them.
You seek them.

2060
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,480
Yeah.
Well Goggins story is so fascinating

2061
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:50,410
because he wasn't that guy.
He was fat and out of shape and

2062
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:55,470
unmotivated and lazy and you know,
talked openly about the first time he

2063
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:56,680
ran,
like he quit.

2064
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:57,910
He was supposed to,
you know,

2065
01:32:57,911 --> 01:33:00,580
ran about three quarters of a mile,
I think he said,

2066
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:05,581
and quit and he was exhausted and just
drinking milkshakes and all fucked up.

2067
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:11,520
And somehow or another decided he's not
going to be that guy anymore and went

2068
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:17,250
180 degrees and became this intensely
motivated ironman.

2069
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:18,730
Yeah,
yeah.

2070
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:21,010
I was at the race.
I saw him at the race where he broke all

2071
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:22,270
the bones in his feet.
You know,

2072
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,200
I saw him,
I was at the,

2073
01:33:23,201 --> 01:33:25,660
I participated in that race the first
time I saw him.

2074
01:33:25,661 --> 01:33:27,330
That's how I met him.
And uh,

2075
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:30,660
in 2007 and uh,
you know,

2076
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:33,020
he broke all the bones in his feet.
He Brooks,

2077
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:33,591
yeah,
he,

2078
01:33:33,591 --> 01:33:34,840
he,
he was running a hundred.

2079
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,840
I was running this race.
It was a 24 hour race as a relay team.

2080
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:41,350
I was with four friends.
And the format of the races,

2081
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:42,280
you know,
you run a mile.

2082
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:44,440
I run a mile,
whatever team runs the most amount of

2083
01:33:44,441 --> 01:33:45,274
miles.
Right.

2084
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:47,620
Wins the race.
He had no teammates.

2085
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:53,860
That sounds like where,
where's the rest of the team?

2086
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:56,710
That sounds like him.
And he weighed a lot at the time.

2087
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:00,790
So I watched him wait a lot.
Was He bodybuilding at the time?

2088
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:03,940
He was just beating.
It probably weighed 260 70 pounds.

2089
01:34:03,941 --> 01:34:05,950
Maybe one was dead lifting and all that.
Maybe,

2090
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:08,560
maybe even more.
So was this the one where he ran 24

2091
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:12,250
hours all around the room just to show
that he could run a hundred miles?

2092
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,320
Want up shitting himself?
Yeah,

2093
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:15,880
he told me about that.
I saw it.

2094
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:17,800
I didn't know he broke all the bones in
his feet.

2095
01:34:17,801 --> 01:34:18,910
He broke some bones.
Yeah.

2096
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:22,210
He didn't even tell me about that.
And then he ran a marathon a month

2097
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:24,250
later.
Yeah,

2098
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:26,530
he's a fucking animal.
Yeah.

2099
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:28,150
Yeah.
I mean he really is.

2100
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:32,110
He was telling me also the blame that to
your wife when you say he's coming to

2101
01:34:32,111 --> 01:34:35,240
live with you.
You don't know.

2102
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,620
My wife
just kick us both out.

2103
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,800
I just said it really fast,
told Saturday cause I flew out,

2104
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:44,230
I flew out to meet Goggins after the
race,

2105
01:34:44,231 --> 01:34:47,110
you know,
I cold called them and uh,

2106
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:50,110
my wife asks me how the meeting went.
And in the meeting,

2107
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:53,140
you know,
I realized like I kind of wanted to get

2108
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:55,000
the secret sauce,
like what the fuck,

2109
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,350
you know?
And um,

2110
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:59,270
was that the idea?
Like,

2111
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,520
yeah,
it was like by,

2112
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:05,180
by being around some such an intensely
motivated guy that you would get the

2113
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:06,740
rub,
get the rub.

2114
01:35:06,741 --> 01:35:09,170
And I had fallen into routine I couldn't
get out of.

2115
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,500
And I just,
you know,

2116
01:35:10,501 --> 01:35:12,290
like I was like,
just get me out of my routine,

2117
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,124
man,
you know,

2118
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:15,320
and I want to learn from you and that
kind of thing.

2119
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:16,580
And,
um,

2120
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:19,310
my wife asks me how the lunch meeting
went and I told her that,

2121
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,810
you know,
he's come live with us.

2122
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,010
She was like,
why?

2123
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:23,930
I like lunch meeting with him.
And did you,

2124
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:26,210
were you going to propose this before
the meeting?

2125
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:30,920
Uh,
I went to w what happened was I went to

2126
01:35:30,921 --> 01:35:32,810
the meeting and,
um,

2127
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:37,610
with no real agenda other than like,
I want to meet this guy,

2128
01:35:37,611 --> 01:35:38,121
man,
you know,

2129
01:35:38,121 --> 01:35:42,350
it's 2007 I want to meet them 2008
something around,

2130
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:44,120
around there was 10 years ago.

2131
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:45,710
And,
uh,

2132
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:49,670
I was just so drawn to him,
you know,

2133
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:53,780
and um,
I actually went home and then,

2134
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:55,710
and then asked him to come,
you know,

2135
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,310
live with me and uh,
and he said yes.

2136
01:35:58,311 --> 01:36:01,820
And then I told my wife after this guys
coming in two days,

2137
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:04,280
now why did he say yes?
I mean,

2138
01:36:04,281 --> 01:36:07,010
isn't he busy?
Did you offer him money?

2139
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,660
Like how did this no,
he was,

2140
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:10,040
um,
he was,

2141
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:12,220
uh,
he was acting,

2142
01:36:12,221 --> 01:36:13,730
he was still in the military at the
time.

2143
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,580
And uh,
yeah,

2144
01:36:16,581 --> 01:36:17,600
I think,
um,

2145
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:21,670
I don't know exactly what triggered.
I remember asking him to comment.

2146
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:25,010
I remember him saying to me,
if you're crazy enough to ask a guy like

2147
01:36:25,011 --> 01:36:26,990
me to come live with you,
mother Fucker,

2148
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:28,040
I'm crazy enough to come.

2149
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,330
Three days later he shows up with one
bag.

2150
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:39,350
No in him.
That is exactly what it would sound like

2151
01:36:39,351 --> 01:36:44,351
if he said it would those crazy eyes.
Jesus Christ.

2152
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:47,900
Sweetie,
this is David.

2153
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:50,030
Wow.
Did you give them an objective?

2154
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:52,730
Do you say,
did you say why you wanted him to come

2155
01:36:52,731 --> 01:36:54,140
or what,
what you're dragging it out.

2156
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:56,720
At that time of my life I had a,
I was,

2157
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:00,530
I had just left,
I have my timeline right.

2158
01:37:00,531 --> 01:37:03,770
I think I just left the,
my private is private jet car company.

2159
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:06,810
I had marquis jet.
I was just starting out in the Zico

2160
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,520
coconut water business and I was in a
routine,

2161
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:11,810
you know,
I was in a Rut,

2162
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:14,000
not,
I was just doing the same stuff,

2163
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:17,030
man.
I was so comfortable and I was just like

2164
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:18,230
this calm,
shake it up man.

2165
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:19,310
You know,
you can travel with me.

2166
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:21,860
I got some meetings coming up,
we'll live together.

2167
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,750
And there was no book,
there was no anything.

2168
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:26,420
Right.
The book happened years later and um,

2169
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:28,490
he said,
he said he would do it.

2170
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,370
That's crazy that he just loved it.
By the way.

2171
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:33,680
It was one of the best months of my
life.

2172
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:36,920
I love being around him.
He's an amazing guy.

2173
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:38,460
I loved,
um,

2174
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:40,730
you know,
we were watching games.

2175
01:37:40,731 --> 01:37:43,010
We were working out.
I was going out at midnight,

2176
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:45,140
three in the morning.
We were running in the blizzards.

2177
01:37:45,141 --> 01:37:47,900
We were reading in the morning one one
day.

2178
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,410
He was like,
we're going to run four miles every four

2179
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:52,730
hours for 48 hours.

2180
01:37:57,810 --> 01:37:59,100
I was like,
I got to work.

2181
01:37:59,101 --> 01:37:59,521
He's like,
no,

2182
01:37:59,521 --> 01:38:02,370
you don't.
No you don't.

2183
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:06,660
You can work 40 in 48 hours or so.
I would wake up at midnight.

2184
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:08,500
We started at midnight.
We would run,

2185
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:12,300
let's say it took us 40 minutes and then
we would come back and we'd have,

2186
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:12,961
you know,
what?

2187
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:17,961
Three hours and 20 minutes of rest and
then at 4:00 AM we go again for miles.

2188
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:19,351
Boom,
boom,

2189
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:19,921
boom,
boom,

2190
01:38:19,921 --> 01:38:21,060
boom.
48 hours.

2191
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:24,390
She,
Jesus Christ one time,

2192
01:38:24,391 --> 01:38:28,560
like I fucking a million stories.
I mean we went in the sauna and he's

2193
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:28,861
like,
all right,

2194
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:31,860
we're going to stay in the sauna for a,
and I'm a sauna guy.

2195
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:33,450
I thought I was just on a guy by the
way.

2196
01:38:33,451 --> 01:38:38,040
I thought I was,
and actually this was the steam and he's

2197
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:39,630
like,
we're going to stay here for 30 30

2198
01:38:39,631 --> 01:38:40,860
minutes,
eight ounces of water.

2199
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,780
Okay.
We Jack it up,

2200
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:46,580
it's fucking cooking in there.
It's,

2201
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,600
I walk in,
I'm like,

2202
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:51,840
holy fuck,
it's so hot in here.

2203
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:54,750
He sits down,
he's whistling Dixie,

2204
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,380
like sitting in the corner doing his
shit.

2205
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:59,670
I'm like,
you know,

2206
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:04,050
eight minutes into my water's gone.
I've already dragged my eight ounces of

2207
01:39:04,051 --> 01:39:08,220
water and about 19 minutes in,
I'm like,

2208
01:39:08,221 --> 01:39:09,270
God,
I got to get out.

2209
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,620
He's like,
you can't get out.

2210
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:11,161
I'm like,
no,

2211
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:11,880
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

2212
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,290
I'm gonna pass out.
I got to get out.

2213
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:14,640
He's like,
you can't get out.

2214
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:15,471
I'm like,
no,

2215
01:39:15,471 --> 01:39:15,750
no,
no.

2216
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,580
And I just,
I couldn't eat.

2217
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:18,750
I didn't even wait for him to say no
again cause I'm about to.

2218
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,570
I'm about to pass out.
I can feel myself about to pass out.

2219
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:25,350
I opened up the door,
all the smoke from the steam room goes

2220
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:26,220
flying out of the door.

2221
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:29,670
I sit right in the chair.
He comes storming out and he looks at

2222
01:39:29,671 --> 01:39:30,090
me.
He's like,

2223
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:31,560
Oh fuck,
you don't look good.

2224
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:32,590
I go,
no,

2225
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:34,290
I'm going to pass out.
He goes,

2226
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,680
we got to abort,
abort to be shit.

2227
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:39,420
Like we're not doing the rest of the 30
minutes.

2228
01:39:39,421 --> 01:39:41,970
Like I got a pass.
And that was the only pass I got.

2229
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,180
Cause you almost died in the sauna or
the steam was fucked.

2230
01:39:45,181 --> 01:39:48,300
Steam rooms different because it's
moisture and you're tying it in.

2231
01:39:48,301 --> 01:39:51,090
I was kicking in like the Eucalyptus and
getting cooked.

2232
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,290
Cooked.
Yeah.

2233
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:54,570
I mean you really getting cooked.
It's not like it was Sony.

2234
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:59,310
You're getting like kind of dry roasted.
Well in the moisture is different.

2235
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:01,320
Like you can't get as hot in a steam
rooms.

2236
01:40:01,321 --> 01:40:02,880
You can in a sauna.
Correct.

2237
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

2238
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,790
So this was a series of these,
it's the,

2239
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,980
you know,
getting poached throughout the,

2240
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:08,814
uh,
yeah.

2241
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:09,961
God,
no,

2242
01:40:09,961 --> 01:40:12,750
he would just make these up,
like come up with these ideas.

2243
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,540
It was just constant man.
Like I mean,

2244
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:18,510
we would go to work,
we'd be sitting at work and um,

2245
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,600
I'd have like a 30 minute break and he'd
be like,

2246
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:24,420
burpee test.
Like what?

2247
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,760
I'm at work.
He'd be like,

2248
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:28,950
I want to see how many burpees you can
do in 10 minutes.

2249
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:31,710
I'd be like burpee tests.
And I was like,

2250
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:34,410
in the middle of work I would like get
down,

2251
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:35,490
take off my,
you know,

2252
01:40:35,491 --> 01:40:38,220
whatever I was wearing.
I was getting like my boxers or whatever

2253
01:40:38,221 --> 01:40:40,680
like just to get,
and I would do as many burpees as I

2254
01:40:40,681 --> 01:40:45,360
could in 10 minutes and be soaking wet
and I'd walk into my next meeting and

2255
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:48,960
everybody knew he was,
he was there was part of the thing.

2256
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,540
So you explained to all these people.
Wow.

2257
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:52,830
Closed every deal.

2258
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,490
I close every deal then cause you're so
amped up.

2259
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:00,580
Plus he was there.
Who's going to say news?

2260
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:02,030
Fat?
More fascinated.

2261
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:05,540
I walk in and they'd be like,
at the end of the day,

2262
01:41:05,690 --> 01:41:06,980
at the end of the meeting I'm like,
do you want to talk?

2263
01:41:06,981 --> 01:41:08,300
He was like,
whatever the fuck you guys we're in,

2264
01:41:08,301 --> 01:41:09,134
we're in.

2265
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:10,820
We're in.
Wow.

2266
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:12,270
That sounds

2267
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:17,060
so much better than living with a monk
was just so much better.

2268
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:18,870
I miss them.
Yeah,

2269
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,420
it's you keep in touch.
Well yeah and we go,

2270
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:21,950
haven't spoken.

2271
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:23,390
Doing a while,
but uh,

2272
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:24,481
yeah.
I mean,

2273
01:41:24,481 --> 01:41:27,050
I've known him since 2007 now and it's
been 10 years.

2274
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,400
Wow.
Yeah.

2275
01:41:28,401 --> 01:41:33,401
I would think that that would be hard
but exciting.

2276
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:38,420
Whereas the monk thing seems like the
drone of it all.

2277
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:41,930
We'll just get to you.
Yeah.

2278
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:46,850
And like I couldn't go back to my room
and my surroundings in the monk thing.

2279
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:50,930
I was like in their world forever.
Forever.

2280
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:52,640
And they live in the same way that you
did.

2281
01:41:52,670 --> 01:41:54,830
They have a little cell as well.
Yeah.

2282
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,070
I actually didn't see their rooms,
but yeah,

2283
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,650
from what I understand,
even smaller than when I was in and I

2284
01:42:00,651 --> 01:42:03,830
was just smaller,
smaller than this table.

2285
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:06,650
Uh,
my room was about the size of this tape.

2286
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:09,260
The winners were smaller from what I
understand.

2287
01:42:09,261 --> 01:42:11,890
Yeah.
How's it even possible bed?

2288
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,310
There's no position isn't like just a
little bad and just go into a space with

2289
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:19,600
a blackout pick up and start all over
again.

2290
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:22,880
Drone.
Drone.

2291
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:23,780
Yeah.
No,

2292
01:42:23,781 --> 01:42:26,330
I think the,
the four miles every 40 minutes or

2293
01:42:26,331 --> 01:42:28,340
whatever the fuck it is,
or four miles every four hours.

2294
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,250
That sounds way better.
Yeah.

2295
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:33,350
That sounds crazy then at the time,
but yeah.

2296
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,480
How'd you end it?
How did he end the 30 days?

2297
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:39,770
Oh,
he left me a note on a post it thanks.

2298
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:42,030
That's it.
That's it.

2299
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:43,433
Jesus.

2300
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,880
That's intense.
Yeah.

2301
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:49,000
Thanks.
Wow.

2302
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:53,760
Jesus Christ.
My goodbyes are like long hug,

2303
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:56,170
changing,
exchanging shit,

2304
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:57,940
planning.
Thanks.

2305
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:03,220
That would be an incredible service.
Like if he wanted to do that,

2306
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:07,150
just go to like billionaires and just
say,

2307
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:10,240
you have to do what I tell you to do for
a month.

2308
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:15,290
I've had a lot of people would do that.
I'm sure she's charged,

2309
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:20,340
charged some fucking stupid amount of
money and have him live with you for a

2310
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:21,850
month,
you know?

2311
01:43:21,851 --> 01:43:26,050
That's hard and anybody personality wise
over time,

2312
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:27,550
having roommates,
it's hot.

2313
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:28,413
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2314
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:31,510
If you 24 seven yeah.
I mean it's hard.

2315
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,820
Do you ever wake you up every day?
Every day he woke up.

2316
01:43:36,570 --> 01:43:38,190
Yup.
Come in and tap me on the shoulder.

2317
01:43:38,270 --> 01:43:41,070
Time to get up.
Let's do with my wife right next to me.

2318
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:42,540
Jesus Christ.

2319
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:46,860
It wasn't a tap tied to do this.
It was

2320
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:49,260
get up,
motherfucker does.

2321
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,300
You'd say?
Well,

2322
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:54,010
at least he was courteous.
Which branch?

2323
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:55,130
Certain wait,
your wife up?

2324
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,050
Yeah.
Was your wife like what in the fun?

2325
01:43:57,051 --> 01:43:58,490
Loved,
she loved them.

2326
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:00,860
Loved them.
But was she to you like,

2327
01:44:00,861 --> 01:44:02,450
what in the fuck are you doing?
She said,

2328
01:44:02,451 --> 01:44:03,500
your ad,
your fucking mind.

2329
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:05,020
Wow.
She,

2330
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:08,570
she said you're crazy.
But 30 days later you must have been in

2331
01:44:08,571 --> 01:44:12,270
six shape.
Ridiculous Shit.

2332
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:17,010
No ridiculous.
I,

2333
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:19,430
when he left,
I didn't do anything for six weeks just

2334
01:44:19,431 --> 01:44:22,160
to catch up.
I didn't do anything for six weeks

2335
01:44:22,161 --> 01:44:23,870
because I couldn't keep the intensity
up.

2336
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:25,640
I just,
I couldn't do it.

2337
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:27,980
I'd run a hundred miles.
I pat down,

2338
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:29,960
you know,
endurance paddle races.

2339
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:31,850
I've done all this shit.
I couldn't do it.

2340
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:34,070
Wow.
I was just like,

2341
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:35,900
why?
You know,

2342
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:39,530
it was wild.
Damn.

2343
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:41,300
I look back on that stuff,
man.

2344
01:44:41,301 --> 01:44:45,110
It's this like,
I just feel so lucky to have had the

2345
01:44:45,111 --> 01:44:46,010
opportunity.

2346
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:47,580
You know what I mean?
Oh yeah.

2347
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:49,460
Like I said,
you're around that you're around the

2348
01:44:49,461 --> 01:44:53,060
best dog trainers you're around,
you know,

2349
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:56,480
and I get to live with it cause my
wife's an amazing entrepreneur.

2350
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:58,700
I get to live with greatness,
you know,

2351
01:44:58,701 --> 01:45:01,520
and just,
you go around these things and it's just

2352
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:04,070
these people.
It's just the stuff that you can learn

2353
01:45:04,071 --> 01:45:06,350
if you allow yourself,
you know,

2354
01:45:06,351 --> 01:45:07,660
to listen.
You know,

2355
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:11,150
I'm not a great listener.
I'm learning to be a good listener

2356
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:13,970
because even like you were giving that
little monologue and he was going

2357
01:45:13,971 --> 01:45:14,631
through it,
I was like,

2358
01:45:14,631 --> 01:45:17,720
yes man,
that shit is resonating with me.

2359
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:20,960
On a high level.
You put yourself in the position and

2360
01:45:20,961 --> 01:45:23,120
then you have to,
you have to be able to extract it and

2361
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:24,190
apply it.
Yeah.

2362
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,920
Yeah.
And exactly what I was saying is what

2363
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:31,100
you got out of Goggins,
like you were around greatness.

2364
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:36,550
You around a man who just does not
accept mediocrity and does not accept

2365
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:40,880
shitty effort.
He wants everything your body can do.

2366
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,690
And through doing that,
you just get something more out of your

2367
01:45:44,691 --> 01:45:46,910
mind.
You get something more out of your life.

2368
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:48,710
The,
the,

2369
01:45:48,730 --> 01:45:51,500
those hard days,
the,

2370
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:53,870
the,
the relaxation is earned.

2371
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:56,300
You appreciate it.
Yes.

2372
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:59,030
Relaxation without any effort.
It's just bullshit.

2373
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:00,880
You feel proud of yourself too.
Yeah.

2374
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,210
That's,
I think like,

2375
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,820
you know,
it's so important to do things that make

2376
01:46:04,821 --> 01:46:07,640
you feel proud of yourself,
you know?

2377
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:09,890
And that's when I left the monastery.
You asked me like,

2378
01:46:09,891 --> 01:46:11,600
you know,
how'd you feel when you got in the car?

2379
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:15,980
And the,
the exact feeling was proud that you

2380
01:46:15,981 --> 01:46:16,880
did.
And I did it.

2381
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,620
Wow.
This was like proud of myself.

2382
01:46:18,621 --> 01:46:21,470
Like I stuck with it.
I did it.

2383
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:24,470
And like,
did you have a little bit of fuck that

2384
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:26,090
place too?
Yes.

2385
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,451
Yes.
I'm like,

2386
01:46:29,451 --> 01:46:30,950
can I,
Uber eats when I get home,

2387
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:33,860
I'll be like,
stop in the first five guys burgers.

2388
01:46:33,861 --> 01:46:35,390
Yeah,
exactly.

2389
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:37,880
Exactly.
Oh Man.

2390
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:38,961
Well listen,
dude,

2391
01:46:38,961 --> 01:46:40,460
I really appreciate you coming in here,
man.

2392
01:46:40,461 --> 01:46:43,880
I really enjoyed talking to and likewise
fucking awesome stories.

2393
01:46:43,881 --> 01:46:44,960
And,
um,

2394
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:47,120
and so the two books are available right
now.

2395
01:46:47,121 --> 01:46:49,740
Anybody could buy them.
Is there an audio of both?

2396
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:50,580
Yes.

2397
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:54,070
Audio books available on audible and
apple books and all that jazz,

2398
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:55,980
living with a seal and living with the
monks.

2399
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:56,771
Thanks a lot,
brother.

2400
01:46:56,771 --> 01:46:57,990
I really appreciate you,
man.

2401
01:46:58,020 --> 01:46:59,280
Thank you so much.
Really enjoyed it.

2402
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,800
He had a mutual friend and um.
