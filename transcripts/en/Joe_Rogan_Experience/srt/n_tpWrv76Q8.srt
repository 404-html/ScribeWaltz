1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,000
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,700
two,
boom.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,590
What's up man?
How are Ya?

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,390
Hello.
Thanks for being here.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,070
Well,
I'm pleased to get here.

6
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:18,071
It's a kind of a strange day in this 
part of strangers that every gets there.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,723
The big concern in Los Angeles has 
always been according to a firefighter 

8
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,024
that I've talked to.
Once that the right wind catches a fire 

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,340
and it takes it all the way through Los 
Angeles,

10
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,510
down to the coast.
Well,

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,470
it's not quite that.
It didn't go through Hollywood.

12
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:34,304
It didn't go.
They think one day it's going to happen 

13
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,790
and with the right when they're not 
gonna be able to stop it,

14
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:38,790
but she's just.
Yeah,

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,693
this was pretty bad.
This is about as bad as I've ever seen 

16
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:43,160
in happen all in one day.
Yeah.

17
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:45,470
It was extraordinary.
Driving down the road to get here.

18
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:50,471
Just these huge,
just huge pillowy.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,820
The.
I thought it was just,

20
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:55,460
you know,
mountains and I thought it was a strange

21
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:58,460
cloud formation,
but it was just smoke smoke.

22
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,383
Yeah.
It looks like a giant gray mountain in 

23
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:02,610
the distance.
Yeah,

24
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,670
it's,
it's insane how bad it's gotten.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,100
I've,
I've had it happen three,

26
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:07,934
this is the third time I've been 
evacuated since I've moved here 20 plus 

27
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:12,320
years ago.
Wow.

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,640
Yeah,
it gets her off.

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,503
But this is the roughest have ever seen.
Jamie and I were doing the podcast 

30
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:17,444
yesterday and when it was over,
I had like five text messages from 

31
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,600
friends that live in my neighborhood 
saying how bad it was.

32
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:27,080
And then when we got home the wind was 
just crazy and it was just,

33
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,760
it's just,
it's humbling,

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,300
you know,
I mean,

35
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,133
it's super unfortunate for all the 
people that are losing their homes and 

36
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:38,240
losing.
They're losing their property.

37
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:42,140
But the reality is this is um,
it's nature.

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,840
This is just something that you just 
can't avoid it.

39
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:45,674
There's nothing you can do about it.
It gets dry like this and I don't know 

40
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,674
what started it.
I hope it wasn't a cigarette because 

41
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,420
that's the big concisely so many moron.
So throwing cigarettes.

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,080
It's not just a weather thing that just 
happens.

43
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:57,914
It's,
it is literally things like cigarettes 

44
00:01:59,001 --> 00:01:59,834
and unfortunately a lot of the times it 
means the weather certainly accentuates 

45
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:08,600
it because it's dry and windy.
And this is fire season.

46
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,813
Well

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,753
anyway.
Hey,

48
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,310
thanks for being here man.
He's incredibly comfortable.

49
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,020
Chairs.
They're not bad.

50
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:16,854
Right?
They're amazing because they support 

51
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,670
your back as well,
which is a 47 year old man is helpful.

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,660
So I'll keep bouncing away from the 
microphone,

53
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:25,620
which I'm sure isn't good.
But yeah,

54
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:26,454
they're incredible.
They keep you sitting straight to 

55
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,160
accentuate your posture.
They do.

56
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,780
There you go.
So what's up man?

57
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:34,820
What are you doing in town?
Shoulders,

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,730
back,
chest out.

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,710
They would be proud.
There you go.

60
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,151
I'm here.
Yeah,

61
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,970
I'm here doing a idea for a week.
I've been A.

62
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,640
I've got a show on Netflix that's come 
out,

63
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:49,641
so I'm just kind of generally here to 
talk about it I guess.

64
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,980
And uh,
seeing a couple of friends and it's been

65
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,630
a really nice,
really nice week.

66
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,123
Yeah,
this is a good way to end it too with a 

67
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:01,170
giant fire and just saying get the fuck 
out of here quickly.

68
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,030
These people are crazy living here with 
no water.

69
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,100
Never rains.
Yeah,

70
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,970
it'll be.
It's very different.

71
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:07,804
Back home.
It'll be.

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,500
It'll.
Yeah.

73
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,730
It's uh,
it's,

74
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,140
it's,
it's amazing.

75
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,974
Just at this time of year,
leaving England and coming to somewhere 

76
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:14,531
like,
I mean,

77
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm sure,
I'm sure you don't take it for granted,

78
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,530
but you know,
it's,

79
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,083
it is amazing.
Just for the weather and just for a bit 

80
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:23,180
you,
would you like la as a,

81
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,580
like as a place in our home and uh,
does it,

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,833
I mean,
you've got an amazing sort of set up 

83
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,281
there.
Is it just a,

84
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,350
is it just a dream place to you?

85
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,810
It's a,
it's a love hate relationship.

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,673
Certainly the,
the real problem is the population is 

87
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:43,550
just so insane.
There's more than 20 million people.

88
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,740
Plus who knows people,
you know,

89
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,574
how many.
They really don't have no idea how many 

90
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,830
people have snuck in.
You know,

91
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,230
it's,
it's just a chaotic place.

92
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,020
There's no public transport.
It just hit me that.

93
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,590
No,
there's no trains,

94
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,830
there's no infrastructure.
A,

95
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,883
everyone's driving these huge.
Everyone has an escalator or a tesla or 

96
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,191
something.
Yeah.

97
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:03,380
It's um,
it's just a strange place.

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,750
There's,
the highways are massive.

99
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,501
You know,
you have five,

100
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:07,334
six lanes on each side and they're 
jammed solid where nothing's moving 

101
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:12,220
either way.
And if you can see it from there,

102
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,063
really we realized how preposterous it 
is when you're flying into lax and you 

103
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:17,441
see the four,
oh,

104
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:22,441
five highway and the distance and it's 
all stopped for as long as you could see

105
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,893
miles one way miles the other way.
Just complete parking lot and just 

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,653
realize,
wow,

107
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,813
what are we doing here?
Found a spot with great weather and you 

108
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,164
know,
and then the entertainment industry 

109
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:38,330
draws people in.
I don't know,

110
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,050
maybe it's better to be in England to 
keep the rain a little bit,

111
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,923
a little bit.

112
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,540
She had like a little bit that I like,
I do like a bit of the Ela,

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,553
so anyway,
I'll take a lot of pictures and it's 

114
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,370
very nice like when the rain clears and 
everything's sort of glistens and that's

115
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,300
a nice.
Yeah.

116
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,410
Your instagram is interesting,
you know,

117
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,260
it's surprising.
Well yeah,

118
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,094
I mainly put,
I paint and I do a lot of street 

119
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,130
photography.
So those,

120
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,540
those.
I've already got into instagram recently

121
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,280
and I've just been putting,
putting that stuff on there,

122
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,890
which I don't know how interesting it 
is.

123
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:08,410
Generally a nice place to put that kind 
of stuff.

124
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,273
I paint like these big portraits and 
they just ended up sitting around my 

125
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,360
house.
No one wants to buy it.

126
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:15,820
No one's to buy a giant picture of my 
mother,

127
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:18,820
so they don't really sell them,
so they just sit around.

128
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,080
So actually,
yeah,

129
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:23,020
putting them on.
At least that's not my mother.

130
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,570
Just for clarity is your stuff is really
good.

131
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,820
Thank you.
Are these.

132
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,710
It's a caricature is Tom waits once.
Excellent.

133
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,943
It's surprisingly good.
I mean you think someone is really good 

134
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:35,024
at something like magic and you say,
well that's about as good as he's 

135
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,280
getting.
Get it.

136
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,610
It's not like he's going to be that good
at something else,

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,150
but you are literally flicking through 
my instagram.

138
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,410
Yeah,
I mean you're,

139
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,860
you're really good art artist.

140
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,380
Thank you very much.
Have you done this your whole life?

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,440
Not yet.
Um,

142
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,470
yeah.
Pretty much like as a,

143
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,590
as a kid I used to draw and paint a lot 
and always faces like I'm no good else,

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,850
but a faces has always been my thing,
so I should do like cut these kind of,

145
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,340
you know,
characatures and now I paint more,

146
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:08,780
sort of straight pictures I guess.
But it's nice if you do something that's

147
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:09,330
kind of,
you know,

148
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,060
public,
it's nice to do something that's private

149
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,120
and it's that thing of something bigger 
than yourself to throw yourself into and

150
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,930
dilute yourself in and it's great,
you know,

151
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,790
days,
weeks of,

152
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,653
you know,
just being in my studio is just as 

153
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,660
lovely.
That's a great thing.

154
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,340
Do you find that stuff like that clears 
your mind for your other work?

155
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,800
I think it's,
it's just the sheer contrast,

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,420
you know,
and one of my favorite parts of the year

157
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:35,254
is touring and I get to do the shows in 
the evening and then the days are free 

158
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,180
and I'm like,
I'm not in London,

159
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:42,070
I'm in some other cities,
so no one can.

160
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,650
No one can like get me in for a meeting 
or anything.

161
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,230
I just had the days free and I can 
write.

162
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,800
I had a book on happiness that I wrote,
which I wrote while I was on tour and it

163
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:54,220
was just this amazing routine of just 
finding a coffee shop,

164
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,560
spending the day writing,
and then if that does get a bit,

165
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,480
you know,
a bit boring or a bit sad or something.

166
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,314
If it's not quite coming together,
you've Dang you then get to go out and 

167
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,224
be this amazingly charismatic,
well rehearsed version of yourself on 

168
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:08,231
stage,
which is,

169
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,730
you know,
full of adrenaline and lovely.

170
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,290
So that,
that's an amazing routine.

171
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,420
I think that's my favorite,
favorite thing.

172
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:14,860
So yeah,
the painting and all that.

173
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,360
Photography is an interesting one 
because you,

174
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:17,194
you,
you find yourself on the one hand kind 

175
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:22,150
of slightly because I do street 
photography so it's kind of,

176
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,053
you know,
out taking pictures of candid moments I 

177
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:26,854
guess.
So your,

178
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,923
you're a step out of it,
but you're also very open and engaged 

179
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,980
and,
and that feels like a really prime state

180
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:33,814
that's very kind of porous,
lovely state to be in and having been 

181
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,194
used to keeping my head down out in 
public because I realize I'm not known 

182
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:41,980
here at all.
But in the UK I a bit.

183
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:45,250
So if I,
if I was out in public or generally kind

184
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:49,180
of naturally kind of hunker,
hunker down and now it's the opposite.

185
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:52,620
It's totally changed that relationship.
So that's good.

186
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,330
Yeah.
It's not just photography,

187
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,370
just being out there and taking pictures
of you having to be mindful and open and

188
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,100
alert and uh,
but at the same time,

189
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:06,100
because I'm probably a little bit shy.
So having that little step back thing as

190
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:06,934
well because you're,
you know,

191
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,860
taking pictures is,
is uh,

192
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,933
I found that really,
really great state and it's a lovely 

193
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:14,010
contrast to the,
uh,

194
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,830
the shows and the,
you know,

195
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,733
the rest of it

196
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:21,570
or you always shy or did you become more
shy because of becoming really famous?

197
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,150
I was always,

198
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,700
well,
not always.

199
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,820
I think I grew quite,
um,

200
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,450
that's probably quite insecure to get.
It was very charming and very,

201
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,340
um,
uh,

202
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,330
quite bright and quite like socially,
you know,

203
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,470
that was,
that was all good.

204
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,540
But I think like inside I was,
um,

205
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,553
I was very intimidated by the kind of 
sporty kids you would have terrified me 

206
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,760
as a,
as a,

207
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,450
as a child.
Um,

208
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,560
and uh,
I fled,

209
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:52,680
uh,
kids like kids,

210
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,603
just sports,
just not use that because I really 

211
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,890
didn't fit in with any of that.
Um,

212
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,193
and so when I first started,
I started my career as a hypnotist and 

213
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:02,644
I,
I saw this guy performing at university 

214
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,304
and I,
uh,

215
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,440
I just thought I'm going to,
I'm going to do that.

216
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:07,950
It just,
I,

217
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,960
I didn't realize at the time all these 
boxes that it was,

218
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,120
you know,
performing that sort of,

219
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:15,990
you know,
need for affirmation and love and center

220
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:18,150
of attention and also the control aspect
of it,

221
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:19,200
you know,
the kind of um,

222
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,530
uh,
yeah,

223
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,340
the control aspect and also the kind of 
people that,

224
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,183
particularly the sort of guys that would
respond well to hypnosis and come up on 

225
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:31,320
stage and you know,
and respond well to it,

226
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,440
tell it to be exactly the kind of guys 
that would really intimidated me before.

227
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,370
So that was at an unconscious level and 
I hope I've grown out of that now.

228
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,870
Main Labor.
Yeah.

229
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,690
It takes a lot of,
it takes a lot of boxes.

230
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,670
So that was,
that's how I started in the Em's.

231
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,553
Definitely driven by insecurity because 
Eddie's any sort of magic which sort of 

232
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,230
followed me on from the hypnosis,
you're basically,

233
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,273
it is the quickest,
most fraudulent route of impressing 

234
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:57,504
people.
That's the subtext is only look at my 

235
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,213
great,
which is not that interesting after 

236
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,850
afterwards.
So I've tried to,

237
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,570
you know,
as I've,

238
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,660
as I've grown up,
I've tried to move into a different area

239
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,690
and one that's a little more resonant 
than just showing off.

240
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,140
That's fascinating that you started out 
doing hypnosis,

241
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:16,170
shows that a comedy show,
I know it was sort of,

242
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,650
um,
I would mainly performance like uh,

243
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,633
colleges and I do a demonstration and 
then have questions and questions and 

244
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:27,330
answers afterwards and I wasn't making 
people look stupid.

245
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,610
It was an entertainment show and I guess
it was kind of funny,

246
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,920
but it was um,
it was,

247
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,150
uh,
it's just a really interesting thing and

248
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,013
the trouble with doing on stage is 
because it gets mixed up with people 

249
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,650
just kind of playing along and stuff.
So it,

250
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,690
it's.
But if you take that out of it,

251
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,620
it's just a really interesting area and 
I've done this stuff for,

252
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,610
you know,
20 years back home and I'm not,

253
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,800
I don't think of myself as a hypnotist.
That was just kind of where I,

254
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,000
where I started.
But the suggestion based techniques.

255
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:54,834
So that is something I continued with 
and brought into different areas and I 

256
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:00,210
still don't fully understand it.
You know,

257
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,044
now you can have a quiet climates inside
someone's head and know what they're 

258
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,780
experiencing.
Like I used to do in the,

259
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,150
what I used to do these like stage 
hypnosis shows.

260
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,983
The last thing I did was to,
I'd tell these people on stage that I 

261
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,470
was invisible,
right.

262
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,420
And I'd,
I'd float something through the air,

263
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,670
right.
Like this bottle I've got here is,

264
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,370
it's normally something bigger like a 
chair and they'd be freaking out,

265
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,650
running off stage and so on.
But afterwards,

266
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:25,490
when I'd had this kind of q and a I 
them,

267
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,580
I'd ask them,
what was your,

268
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:29,220
what was your actual experience like,
like,

269
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,680
the show's over and I'll be honest,
what we,

270
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,623
what you're experiencing.
And you'd get some people that would 

271
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:34,640
say,
well yeah,

272
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,050
you were obviously just floating that 
you were just holding it,

273
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:37,884
but I kind of felt like I had to play 
along and then you'd get this 

274
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,430
interesting area in the middle of,
of like,

275
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,770
well I kind of,
I now when I think that yes,

276
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,604
of course it was you,
but it was and I sort of knew it was 

277
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,540
you,
but I am emotionally just completely.

278
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,763
I could only experience it as a 
terrifying floating bottle or whatever 

279
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,670
it was.
So that's a bit like an actor,

280
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,140
like getting caught up in a role I 
guess.

281
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:56,974
Like they know,
they know they're onstage and it's a 

282
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:59,740
character,
but nonetheless emotionally committed.

283
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,980
And at the other extreme,
people that would not accept that it was

284
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:03,880
me floating,
it just,

285
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:05,980
they that must have been on a wire or 
something.

286
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:06,814
There's no,
there's no way that I could drop you 

287
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,390
back at the picture in my memory of that
thing.

288
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,740
So how do you know?
How do you,

289
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,030
how do you judge what that experience is
when there's and,

290
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:16,090
and all those people that are saying,
no,

291
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:16,924
you are really invisible.
Are they just saying that because they 

292
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,840
want to be like the best subjects in 
that,

293
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,793
in that group.
I mean,

294
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,090
how do you tease it all apart?

295
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,510
It's that is,
is that that must be a real issue,

296
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,344
right?
The people that just want to please you 

297
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:28,474
and are playing along.
How can you tell if you were fighting 

298
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,261
people?
Yeah,

299
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:33,094
I can tell,
but I.

300
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,870
The way I use it now,
he's kind of,

301
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,050
I use it quite sort of subtly in the 
show.

302
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,603
I don't like overtly hypnotize people,
so that means it can mean one of two 

303
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,730
things.
It either means it just,

304
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,813
I'm not interested people playing along 
because I'm not just trying to create 

305
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:51,694
the effect of someone hypnotized.
They need to genuinely be responding to 

306
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,300
this thing in order for the next bit to 
work,

307
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,230
in which case I have to filter out 
anybody playing lumbered,

308
00:12:58,231 --> 00:12:59,170
but occasionally,

309
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,410
occasionally it doesn't matter.
Like a lot of the time,

310
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,030
like I'll get people up on stage and 
I'll shake their hand and they're,

311
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,580
there's a rapid handshake induction that
the guidance just falls to the floor.

312
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,633
Um,
and there are times that that matters 

313
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,030
and they have to be,
that has to be really honest response.

314
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,253
Other times I can tell they're sort of 
half into it and they're just a bit 

315
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,610
intimidated and,
but for the 2000 people looking,

316
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,444
that might look,
it kind of might look like the same 

317
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:25,300
thing and then it won't,
does exactly.

318
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,830
Does that work?
The handshake induction,

319
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,400
what?
It's,

320
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,440
it's a,
uh,

321
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,573
I take no responsibility for explaining 
this to your tens of millions of 

322
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,443
listeners and viewers.
Um,

323
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,111
but,
uh,

324
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:35,950
it's,
it's,

325
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,620
you're,
you're interrupting a,

326
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,060
an automatic process,
right?

327
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:40,894
This is the,
this is the key to it was made popular 

328
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:44,434
by,
um,

329
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,450
made popular by I guess Richard Bandler 
who's the guy behind nlp and so on.

330
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,520
I don't know if he kind of created this 
thing,

331
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:54,030
but perhaps perhaps Erickson did before 
him.

332
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,970
I don't know.
Anyway,

333
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,140
you take an automatic process and you 
interrupted in the middle.

334
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,850
So like when you're shaking hands with 
somebody,

335
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,600
it's such a familiar process that when 
you start,

336
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:05,381
you're not thinking,
okay,

337
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:06,700
I'm going to grip this person's hand 
now.

338
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,680
Now I'm going to move my hand up and 
down with them a few times.

339
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,560
Then I'll take my hand to what you just 
kind of do it automatically.

340
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,950
And there's something about interrupting
that that Leaves People Really

341
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,090
flummoxed and bewildered because they're
really,

342
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,250
really caught off guard.
Like if you imagine somebody comes up to

343
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:26,310
you in the street and says it's not half
past seven,

344
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,650
you know,
your reaction isn't to go,

345
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:28,980
yeah,
yeah,

346
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,310
I know it's 20 past nine.
Your reaction is,

347
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,110
is a sort of,
you think you've missed something,

348
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,060
like you're trying to make sense of it.
It's a strange,

349
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,880
uh,
Kinda put you on the back foot.

350
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,953
And at that point if you to,
if you've got somebody who's fairly 

351
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:44,160
suggestible and people coming up on 
stage,

352
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,220
it's such an odd moment for them anyway.
They're naturally wrote,

353
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:51,221
suggestible that a clear instruction to 
sleep or whatever you want give them,

354
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:55,340
tends to be taken very deeply and very 
often than you'll see on shake hands.

355
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:56,174
And I'll,
I'll break the pattern of the 

356
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,713
handshakes.
I'll,

357
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,623
I'll often take their hand and lifted up
to their face and say sleep and show 

358
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,434
them their hand like that and they just 
sleep and well it's not sleep that it's 

359
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:08,270
a kind of um,
it looks like.

360
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,940
I mean they,
they'll do anything from eyes closed.

361
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:14,300
Head drops down to just drop like a,
like a dead weight on the floor,

362
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,343
you know,
what I found is most interesting 

363
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,544
actually.
It was like applying this in slightly 

364
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:24,671
more useful everyday situations was as a
sort of like a self defense technique.

365
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,174
I was walking a between so I was like,
must have been like 20 or something and 

366
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,463
I was at a magic convention and I was 
walking from one hotel to another and 

367
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:40,450
I'm dressing like a three piece velvet 
suit as skinny British law,

368
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:41,490
but might as well have,
you know,

369
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,790
punched me in the throat,
tattooed across my face.

370
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,983
And this guy comes up and it's like he's
drunk and he's about three in the 

371
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:49,580
morning.
Drunk aggressive is with his girlfriend,

372
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,030
clearly looking for a fight.
And uh,

373
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,490
he sort of,
he comes up to me and he says,

374
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:56,071
well,
what do you,

375
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,380
what do you fucking looking at when 
you're looking at?

376
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,330
And because I'd spoken about this,
how to deal with this sort of thing,

377
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:04,040
but it never found myself in this 
situation.

378
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,800
I kind of had it all mentally rehearsed.
So I said to him,

379
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,480
I said,
the wall outside,

380
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:13,481
my house isn't four foot high and I 
guess there's an equivalent to this with

381
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,940
sort of adrenaline dump.
I think it's called and in martial arts,

382
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:18,710
but there's a,
it just like,

383
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,190
he's got all this adrenaline and then a 
thing like that for me,

384
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,320
which is just out of context.
Like it makes sense.

385
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,270
I'm not talking gibberish.
It makes sense,

386
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:28,940
but it's just out of context.
So now suddenly he's thinking,

387
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,890
I've what?
I've missed something.

388
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:33,800
So now he,
he was sort of went what?

389
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,000
And I said his girlfriend walked off and
I said,

390
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,940
the wall outside,
my house isn't for,

391
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:39,980
for high.
I spent some time in Spain,

392
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:40,814
the walls that were very high,
but if you look at the ones here that 

393
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,310
they're tiny,
they're nothing.

394
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,600
And then he just sort of broke down.
He sort of at war,

395
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,370
ha.
And uh,

396
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,440
started crying,
what,

397
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,870
you know,
it wasn't quite crying,

398
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:51,704
but it was just,
it was like all the adrenaline and 

399
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,953
everything just just flooded out of him.
And he sat down and I ended up sitting 

400
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,270
next to him on the,
uh,

401
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,870
on the road side.
I'm asking him,

402
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,913
you know,
so what was the plan was I was going to 

403
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,630
try and stick his feet to the floor and 
lay out.

404
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,480
His whole family just kind of collapsed 
and sat down.

405
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,190
So yeah,
that was because I knew it would be like

406
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,660
this highly suggestible state and either
way,

407
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:17,480
the moment of aggression and passed.
But I ended up,

408
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,373
ended up weirdly sitting with them,
asking him what had happened that 

409
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:21,404
evening and his girlfriend,
I think she'd bottled somebody or 

410
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:23,760
something horrible had happened.

411
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,400
So we'd got out with all this 
aggression,

412
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,360
but it's a,
it's a good one,

413
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,400
isn't it?
If you just have like,

414
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:28,234
um,
it could be just a song lyric or just 

415
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,464
some,
some weird kind of thing that you can 

416
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,850
just go into in those situations.
I mean,

417
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:35,930
if someone's running at you with a 
knife,

418
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,180
it's a bit difficult,
but you just,

419
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,043
you,
you're kind of strangely taking control 

420
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,043
of a situation.
Otherwise what you're going to do if 

421
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:43,760
they say,
what are you looking at?

422
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,583
You can't,
there's no way you can answer that 

423
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,624
without being on the back foot.
So it just kind of nicely kind of 

424
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:52,370
inverts the situation and puts them on 
the bank vault,

425
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,191
which anyway,
it worked.

426
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:55,560
It was a,
it was kind of fun.

427
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,460
Isn't there like a process required to 
hypnotize someone?

428
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,420
You could just do it that way and saying
it didn't.

429
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,440
Just talk them through some sort of a 
program that makes them think their foot

430
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:06,370
is stuck to the floor.

431
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,640
I,
it,

432
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,750
it will.
Depends on the moment I had.

433
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,340
I used to hypnotize people in my,
in my room when I was a student.

434
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:17,290
Right.
So I was the guy that did hypnosis,

435
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,650
what are people coming regularly coming 
to to try it out?

436
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,450
And um,
I this,

437
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,483
this one time I used to leave people 
with like if they were responsive to it 

438
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,350
and this was like I was really early 
days,

439
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:30,184
it was like 20 minutes,
half an hour of relaxing somebody and 

440
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:32,734
maybe suggesting that their hands were 
getting lightened floating or heavy and 

441
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:36,490
they couldn't lift them.
So kind of,

442
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,110
you know,
kind of basic stuff.

443
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,333
But I would leave them if they were very
suggestible with the instruction that 

444
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:43,060
when you come back,
if I click my fingers,

445
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:45,240
you'll get back into the sleep state and
they,

446
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:46,790
you know,
they kind of get conditioned to that.

447
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,610
It'll often work even like a week later 
and this guy came and uh,

448
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,840
I thought I'd seen him before.

449
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,430
I thought he'd been on the previous 
week.

450
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,980
So he sat down and I go look at me and 
sleep,

451
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,990
click my fingers.
And he went out,

452
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,070
whatever that means.
Right?

453
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:03,670
And then we did whatever it was.
Maybe perhaps you wanted to stop smoking

454
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:06,250
or his hands floating in the air.
Whatever it wasn't at the end of it,

455
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,280
I realized in talking to him that I 
hadn't met him before,

456
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,291
so then I'm like,
well,

457
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,030
how did,
how did,

458
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,893
why did you respond to me clicking my 
fingers because I don't have magic 

459
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:16,954
fingers.
There's nothing like anything going on 

460
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:20,080
here other than.
And I realized it was just that.

461
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:20,914
It was just that moment of my kind of 
confidence with it and the fact 

462
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,903
fortuitously that he was also very 
suggestible and put those two things 

463
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,530
together.
That's what made it work.

464
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:30,364
It was just that,
that psychological moment for him that 

465
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:34,504
was more important than the nature of 
the 20 minute script that I'd been 

466
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:41,130
learning and using up to that point.
So that was kind of a seminal seminal.

467
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,400
Yes.

468
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,860
Confidence in that he had already been 
under.

469
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,430
Yeah.
I didn't question it because I really,

470
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,290
I believe that he had and it just kind 
of,

471
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,660
it just sort of happened and then he 
just.

472
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:52,750
If he hadn't been a suggestible type and
it probably wouldn't have worked,

473
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,000
but luckily he was.
And that kind of really,

474
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,253
really changed the way that I,
that I thought about hypnosis and also 

475
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,800
started this,
you know,

476
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,570
this realization that ultimately my,
my kind of toolkit with what I do is,

477
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,310
is the stories that people are telling 
themselves that's,

478
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,840
that's kind of,
that's really all there is.

479
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,703
Even a magician showing you a card trick
is just getting you to tell yourself a 

480
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:18,550
story,
edit,

481
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,270
edit this event in such a way that you 
go,

482
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,901
oh,
you know,

483
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,450
I picked a card and then it disappeared 
and it was,

484
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,440
it was in my pocket.
He never went near me.

485
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,190
And you it out.

486
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,023
All the bits that don't seem important.
Like when he complimented you on your 

487
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,443
jacket earlier on in the day and may 
have stuck a card in there or the bit 

488
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,160
where he took the car back for a moment,
whatever.

489
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:36,994
Because you don't,
you know,

490
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,893
you're,
you're being sold a story with a 

491
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,630
particular sort of edit points.
And you know,

492
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,800
to me that's interesting because that's 
what life is,

493
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,630
you know,
we have this infinite data source coming

494
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:48,760
at us.
We can,

495
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,240
we just have to kind of reduce it to 
store is to make to make sense.

496
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,074
I think stripping aside all the kind of 
Vaudeville and tacky associations of 

497
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,740
hypnotists and magicians and solid think
there's something.

498
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,180
There's something interesting at the 
heart of it.

499
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:06,181
I think that that our storytelling 
capacity is endlessly fascinating to me.

500
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,380
Well,
it's fascinating in that regard,

501
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:13,770
but it's also fascinating that there 
seems to be like some cheat code,

502
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,690
the human mind,
like there's a,

503
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,613
there's a way you can like lock into 
like an admin panel and all of a sudden 

504
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:21,714
you're doing things like telling people 
they don't really don't want to be 

505
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:24,924
smoking or putting them into this 
hypnotic mindset by just snapping your 

506
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:29,430
fingers and sang sleep.

507
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,570
It's odd.
I think it is.

508
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,460
I think it looks like that and that's 
the problem because it looks it.

509
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,563
It's.
You so often see it when performers are 

510
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,870
doing it and they're often going for 
kind of theatrical effect.

511
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:42,704
If you go and look at it like a clinical
environment where hypnosis are being 

512
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:47,840
investigated,
it isn't like that at all.

513
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,340
It's much more a kind of boring in a 
wiser,

514
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:52,611
isn't,
it?

515
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,100
Doesn't have any theater attached to it 
as much more on,

516
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:55,934
you know,
kind of intuitively understandable had 

517
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,780
been hypnotized yourself.
I'm terrible.

518
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:01,370
I'm a really bad,
really bad subject.

519
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:06,371
I had one experience where I only one 
when I was in like a workshop thing that

520
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:07,840
I was,
there is a,

521
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,680
like a,
you know,

522
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,410
a pain,
a person that wasn't giving the workshop

523
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,740
and um,
I was sat with,

524
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:15,061
uh,
the,

525
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:16,100
the,
the exercise was,

526
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,060
it really worked for me.

527
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,810
It might work for others.
So you're split into pairs and uh,

528
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,900
the idea is you start to describe a 
scene.

529
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:25,130
So you sat,
sat with this woman,

530
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:25,964
you close your eyes,
you start to describe a scene and you 

531
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:29,810
get back and forth adding details.
Right?

532
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:32,210
So she says I become laying on a beach.
And um,

533
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,680
so I just imagine that like,
okay,

534
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,930
now I'm going to beach and I can,
um,

535
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,650
I can feel the warmth of the sun on my 
face.

536
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,380
So I'm just kind of like imagining it 
and joining in with the story.

537
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,310
And then I just remember somebody going,
okay,

538
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:47,000
guys,
time out,

539
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,060
time for lunch.
And I,

540
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,013
I,
I had been on a behind beat on a beach 

541
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:51,920
and I,
I'd completely just,

542
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,563
I'd been there like a dream.
It was completely real at some point it 

543
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,783
tipped into that.
That's the only experience I've had of 

544
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:58,790
it.

545
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,550
Other than that,
I don't respond to it.

546
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,740
I'm just not.
I think it's just suggestibility.

547
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,430
It's something about a.
and we get it when you know,

548
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,303
we get it,
when a doctor gives us a placebo and we 

549
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:13,100
respond to that because this authority 
figure is giving us that or,

550
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,113
or the way we absorb a opinions of 
people that we admire and experts that 

551
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:18,974
we admire.
How we just more easily take those on 

552
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:21,174
board.
Unquestioningly this is all the same 

553
00:23:22,071 --> 00:23:23,300
thing.
It's just suggestion.

554
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,910
The trouble is most of the time it's 
done through the world of the performing

555
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:29,744
hypnotists,
which isn't.

556
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,663
It isn't giving really a very clear and 
fair view of what was going on because 

557
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,000
it's so theatrical and so often you 
know,

558
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,970
you're,
you're relishing and things like I click

559
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:43,550
my fingers and this guy went to sleep,
but that's not really,

560
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,073
you know,
the,

561
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,710
what are they doing?

562
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,543
Their Qa,
they just,

563
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,863
I think just kind of responding because 
you've just asked them to and they know 

564
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:50,834
that when you click their fingers,
they're supposed to go to sleep is 

565
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,624
there's a real range of possible 
experiences that you might look like a 

566
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:58,400
power,
but it doesn't mean it is.

567
00:23:58,401 --> 00:23:59,234
They might just be just complying.
I was going to do some of this stuff on 

568
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:06,650
stage without using the hypnosis to show
that there's.

569
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,513
I don't think there's anything that 
happens under Moses that can't be done 

570
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:13,160
without a.
and I was having this discussion with my

571
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:18,161
friend Andy who directs and my stage 
shows with me and I was saying like that

572
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:19,281
thing of,
you know,

573
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:23,000
when you,
when a hypnotist get somewhere to eat an

574
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,230
onion and says,
you know,

575
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:25,064
this is a classic hypnotic stone.
Gives them a raw onion and says it's a 

576
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:27,980
delicious juicy apple.

577
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,480
Now we sit and enjoy it and you get 
somebody munching into an onion and like

578
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,550
having no problem eating it.
I was like,

579
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:35,384
well,
I'm sure that feels like if you're just 

580
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:39,620
going to pull it off without hypnosis,
would that just happened anyway?

581
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,860
And Andy said,
I bet I bet you can use it anyway.

582
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:43,940
And he went to my fridge,
took out an onion,

583
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,880
took a big bite of it,
and it was fine because he's so.

584
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:48,290
He's proving a point there,
right?

585
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,124
So he's in a different mental state than
somebody going got a day to take a bite 

586
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:55,610
of that onion when suddenly you're like,
you're preempting the,

587
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:56,444
you know,
the disgust and all the reasons not to 

588
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:00,020
do it,
but the fact that he was just going,

589
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,640
I bet you can do it.
And trying to prove a point.

590
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,020
Many,
he did it and it was fine.

591
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,630
So that was a different mental state and
it worked.

592
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,120
So that wasn't hypnosis,
but the end result still,

593
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,283
if you do that onstage and pretended to 
hypnotize somebody first it would look 

594
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:15,070
like you've done something amazing.
So I don't know.

595
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,740
It is.
It's,

596
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,573
it's to me it's just,
it's just that story that someone's 

597
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:21,200
telling themselves.
What did it taste like?

598
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,050
An onion to him or did it?
It just,

599
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,230
it's just,
it would have.

600
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:24,751
No,
no,

601
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:25,011
no,
no.

602
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,160
It would have tasted like an onion.
I.

603
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,940
There was no suggestion of female that 
are hypnotized.

604
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,120
Does it tastes like an apple to them?
Well,

605
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:33,360
I don't know.
It's like a monument.

606
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,820
Invisible one of the.
What are they seeing?

607
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:36,790
I think for some of them it will,
you know,

608
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,230
taste and pain and things like that and 
discomfort.

609
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:40,064
It's all very subjective.
But the end result of doing this thing 

610
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:46,610
that looks like it couldn't happen 
without some magical process.

611
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,443
That's the key.
And none of these things really demand 

612
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,714
that met.
Even when even when you look at people 

613
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:52,094
being I'm undergoing surgery through 
hypnosis and being wide awake and being 

614
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:57,890
cut open.
So you think,

615
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:58,724
well that must be evidence.
The hypnosis is some special thing 

616
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:05,060
because that couldn't happen otherwise,
but of course it can,

617
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:05,894
you know,
the layer of skin that feels pain is 

618
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:09,980
actually sort of quite thin.
So once you get through that,

619
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:11,660
when you're moving organs around,
that's not,

620
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,520
that's not a painful process anyway.
Plus very fully tend to use a bit,

621
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,373
a little bit of like a local anesthetic 
anyway just to numb the very top layer 

622
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:20,421
of skin.
So again,

623
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:23,100
what looks amazing very often isn't,
it's a,

624
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,310
it's an endlessly rich and bizarre area 
to me.

625
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,320
And I kind of,
um,

626
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,153
as I said,
I don't really think of myself as a 

627
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,580
participant that the,
that process,

628
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:35,940
that kind of,
uh,

629
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,860
ability for people to get into this 
space where they could have that kind of

630
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,710
experience is,
um,

631
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,730
is something I,
you know,

632
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,830
I'll always find interesting.

633
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,000
One of the recent stage shows I did a,
it's called miracle.

634
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:51,834
I don't know if you've seen it,
but I'm faith healing in the second 

635
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,650
half.
So using exactly the same idea.

636
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,070
And I've got an audience that are like 
me,

637
00:26:58,071 --> 00:26:59,010
you know,
that don't believe in that.

638
00:26:59,011 --> 00:26:59,590
And I'm saying,
look,

639
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,470
I mean I'm an atheist,
I don't believe in this either,

640
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:04,620
but will you just kind of go with me or 
at least at the start,

641
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:07,290
because the results are a really 
interesting.

642
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,124
And I,
um,

643
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,010
I just started doing this,
this,

644
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:11,844
I'm fighting,
not really knowing if it was going to 

645
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,490
work.
I thought,

646
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:15,324
well,
I can get some adrenaline going and I 

647
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,400
know could see the techniques that the 
charlatan faith healers we're using.

648
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:22,230
And uh,
I thought,

649
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:22,820
well,
I'll just,

650
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,670
I'll,
I'll do that.

651
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,563
And I thought,
well,

652
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,060
the adrenaline kills pains,
I think get some adrenaline going.

653
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:28,430
There's bound to be people that said,
oh,

654
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,450
I had a pain in my back and now it's 
gone.

655
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,080
But the actual results,
admittedly with small percentages of the

656
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:34,651
audience,
right,

657
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:35,484
not everybody,
but the people that were coming up and 

658
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:40,860
saying,
I had this problem and now it's gone.

659
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,900
And they were,
there was a woman that had a,

660
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,410
she'd been paralyzed on one side of her 
body since a kid.

661
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,244
And she's like,
in her forties now she's in floods of 

662
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:50,640
tears going,
I couldn't move my arm.

663
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,474
And this was,
this is a skeptical audience like me 

664
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:56,100
that know that there's kind of playing 
along with something.

665
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,660
And uh,
nonetheless,

666
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,710
again,
small percentage,

667
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:59,101
not,
not,

668
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,150
not everybody,
but having,

669
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,270
having these kinds of experiences.
It is.

670
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,350
So that's less of a psychological 
component of suffering,

671
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,220
which,
which is,

672
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:10,040
which was really eye doing that show 
night after night after night.

673
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,323
Well,
faith healing has got to be a form of 

674
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,750
hypnosis,
right?

675
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,990
Yeah,
exactly.

676
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,770
It's the same world is playing.
They both were,

677
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:22,600
they both joined by is the idea of 
suggestibility and uh,

678
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,150
it doesn't.
And sometimes those healings,

679
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:26,984
it's sort of,
I mean,

680
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,520
if you take an x ray before and 
afterwards,

681
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:29,354
nothing's changing,
but in as much as a lot can depend on 

682
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,650
this psychological component,
it can,

683
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,823
can really make a difference.
It gives the percentages are getting 

684
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,750
smaller.
So 3000 people in the audience,

685
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,703
300 people come up,
10 people come up on stage and I'm 

686
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,610
involving them in the show,
but getting even smaller.

687
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:48,770
There are people that like a year later 
we're getting in touch and say,

688
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:51,130
just so you know,
that thing did actually clear,

689
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,973
like it hasn't come back because I 
thought it would only last for 10 

690
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:54,614
minutes while they're on stage and then,
which is why you don't tell people to 

691
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:58,220
throw the pills away and so on.
Right?

692
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:01,550
But we're in probably like that half a 
percent now,

693
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:03,350
which is always going to be kind of 
pretty extraordinary.

694
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:05,150
But um,
uh,

695
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,790
it was like a real,
real thing.

696
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:08,624
So when it's still,
if you had 200 people and one of them 

697
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:15,080
actually cured from that,
that is immensely bizarre.

698
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,470
It's immensely bizarre,
but it's,

699
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:17,660
it's bizarre.
And,

700
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,353
and I'm like,
I had this bad shoulder for a long time 

701
00:29:22,281 --> 00:29:23,114
and I,
uh,

702
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,640
I got really used to,
when I put a jacket on,

703
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,760
kind of putting this in my left arm,
putting it in,

704
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:29,594
like letting my left arm go dead and 
then using my right arm to pull the 

705
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,070
thing up.
Right now I don't know how much I really

706
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:36,710
need to do that anymore or whether I'm 
just doing it out of habit.

707
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,320
But if somebody got me up on stage and 
said,

708
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,303
your left shoulder is healed,
it's now and kind of made me feel a bit 

709
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,290
now go on,
try it,

710
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,460
try and move your,
move your arm.

711
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,443
I think in the surprise of it and the 
sheer kind of just snapping out of that 

712
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:53,560
habit of being like,
this is my dead arm,

713
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:54,394
I probably would be very surprised that 
I could actually move it as much as I 

714
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,000
can.

715
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,271
You know,
it's,

716
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,460
it's just,
it's like when you break it down,

717
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:01,780
it's like not that amazing.
But when you,

718
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,180
when you,
when you see the,

719
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:05,014
the,
the more kind of extreme and exciting 

720
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,540
ends at that.
It's,

721
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,473
it is mind blowing.
And then you've realized how these 

722
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:12,454
performance,
how you start to go mad yourself and 

723
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:14,681
think,
well,

724
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:19,120
I've got this special gift I could pack 
out stadia doing like,

725
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,230
uh,
I did think of one point,

726
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:22,810
why don't I do like a secular healing 
show?

727
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:23,441
I could say,
well,

728
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:24,730
this is,
it's just,

729
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,593
you know,
it doesn't work in everybody and it may 

730
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,184
only work for 10 minutes,
but it certainly works in some meaning 

731
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,320
of the word anyway.
I didn't do that,

732
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:35,470
but you know,
you can start to go mad.

733
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,180
Well,
the processes of the mind,

734
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:40,030
I mean the idea of the placebo effect is
fascinating.

735
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,240
The idea that your mind has some ability
that you can't tap into consciously,

736
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,250
but you can in some sort of a 
subconscious sense.

737
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:49,084
Someone gives you something and if 
you're convinced that it's doing 

738
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:55,570
something positive and it actually will 
have some benefit to you of real,

739
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:56,404
tangible,
measurable benefit and it doesn't seem 

740
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:02,140
to make sense.
There's no mechanism that we can trace.

741
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,110
There's no mechanism.
No,

742
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,983
it's what I found works really well is 
I've done a few shows on placebo is for 

743
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:08,534
me,
I found the key is the person gets to 

744
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,950
absolve any responsibility for the 
change themselves.

745
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:13,784
So they.
I've done a couple of things where this 

746
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,230
new show I have on Netflix now called 
sacrifice.

747
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,660
A guy thinks he's got a micro chip 
implanted in him,

748
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,810
which is doing all the work.
Uh,

749
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,773
another show I've done is,
was a placebo injections they were 

750
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:28,430
getting.
So they fill the drug is doing the work,

751
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:29,264
but the key is they don't have to.
They don't think they're doing any work 

752
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:33,464
at all.
This thing is taking care of that for 

753
00:31:35,481 --> 00:31:36,314
me.
And that's really powerful because 

754
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:38,744
suddenly it's,
it's that thing of I don't have to do 

755
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,160
the person thinking,
I don't have to make this happen myself.

756
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:47,330
There is no onus on me.

757
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,070
I don't have to do any anything.
This,

758
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,790
this magic formula is somehow doing it 
is hugely powerful.

759
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,131
So that.
Yeah,

760
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:55,721
that's,
that's a,

761
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:57,230
that's A.
I think that's a big,

762
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,370
big part of it,
which is why a lot of the.

763
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,820
When we,
when we did the placebo program,

764
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:06,821
we created this whole like I'm fake a 
pharmacological building.

765
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:08,054
We had a building.
We just fitted out with actors and 

766
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,783
equipment and stuff to just create this 
environment that was going to be 

767
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:15,180
convincing before the injections were 
even given.

768
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:16,014
And these people that had various like 
fears or problems or things that would 

769
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:24,100
be just going to just investigate and 
see how well the placebo worked and uh,

770
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,061
yeah,
it did.

771
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:27,170
But that,
that that's a helpful thing.

772
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,210
Feeling.
There's just something in you making it,

773
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,750
making it happen.
Yeah.

774
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,520
Almost like a subconscious optimism or 
something like that.

775
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,130
Yeah.
I've,

776
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:34,963
I've wondered if that sort of mindset 
that allows you to experience a 

777
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:43,244
beneficial result of a placebo if that 
in some way transfers over to everyday 

778
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:50,444
life events if having this may be 
unfounded sense of optimism or this a 

779
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,440
bizarrely positive outlook or this,
uh,

780
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,743
almost undo confidence actually can have
some sort of a beneficial tangible 

781
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:12,110
result in the real world in terms of 
actual events that take place.

782
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,363
Whether it's because of the way you 
interact with other human beings that 

783
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:19,330
they are being influenced by your 
positive attitude,

784
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,580
attitude and energy and the confidence 
and enthusiasm.

785
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,683
And then therefore things go smoother or
whether it's really some sort of a 

786
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:31,010
factor of the way you interchange with 
reality itself.

787
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,490
And that your attitude actually has an 
effect on events.

788
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,723
I think it gets vastly overrated.
I'm a big advocate of strategic 

789
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:40,694
pessimism.
I think the the problem with that kind 

790
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:47,230
of the problem with unwavering 
self-belief,

791
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,060
yes.
Is that it just doesn't.

792
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,090
That doesn't quite map into how life 
works,

793
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,160
I think.
I think the Greeks had this down,

794
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:59,030
so if you imagine a kind of a graph,
so you've got your,

795
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,123
your y axis going up here of your aims 
and things you want to achieve and then 

796
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:07,520
your x axis is just what they used to 
call fortune stuff.

797
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:10,310
That life throws back at you that you 
have no control over,

798
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:11,144
no control at all.
So we are told a lot nowadays that you 

799
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:17,540
just set your goals,
believe in yourself,

800
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:22,370
visualize this as if we can crank up the
sort of the line that we're living.

801
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,533
Yes,
right up in line with our goals and our 

802
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,440
aims and so on.

803
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,280
The reality is there's always life like 
pushing back.

804
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,750
So actually what we lead is an x equals 
y line.

805
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:38,540
That that's a kind of more realistic,
I think appraisal of what our life is.

806
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,553
So actually kind of sort of,
I think making peace with that which 

807
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:43,844
allows for all the optimism you want,
but also makes peace with the fact that 

808
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:51,200
at some point that might let you down,
you know,

809
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:52,034
you can spend your life climbing a 
ladder and then realize you had it 

810
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:57,920
against the wrong wall to quote Joseph 
Joseph Campbell,

811
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:58,754
you know,
you can set goals that they may just be 

812
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:02,990
the wrong goals and you may achieve 
them.

813
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:03,824
And then like,
you know,

814
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,760
now what I've got,
you know,

815
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,460
a friend who um,
uh,

816
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,803
spend a long time building up a company 
and selling it and it'd been driven to 

817
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:14,990
do this all his life because he liked,
needed to sort of achieve,

818
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:15,980
to feel like,
you know,

819
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:19,850
that he was a kind of really worth 
something that was,

820
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,950
he was all about achievement and then he
sells the company,

821
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:23,963
achieves that dream and then he didn't 
know what to do with his life because 

822
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:27,500
that urge was still there.

823
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,230
Now it had nowhere to go and actually 
ended up in therapy because of it.

824
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,560
It was such a strangely a counter 
intuitive thing.

825
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,910
So I,
you know,

826
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,833
I'm,
what about changing the world for the 

827
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:40,920
better,
but I think we have to make mental space

828
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,100
for the fact that,
um,

829
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,830
like when,
when Freud credit psychoanalysis,

830
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,390
he wasn't trying to make people happy,
he called it,

831
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,050
he called it restoring,
restoring natural unhappiness.

832
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,313
My life is basically going to be unhappy
sometimes and he was trying to get rid 

833
00:35:56,371 --> 00:36:00,000
of unnatural unhappiness as he saw it,
like it sort of neurotic unhappiness and

834
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:05,001
restore a kind of an easy relationship 
to life and fortune.

835
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,480
So to me that's,
that's the case.

836
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:08,890
I'm always a bit,
was a bit skeptical of the kind of,

837
00:36:08,891 --> 00:36:11,700
uh,
just unwavering positivity.

838
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,660
Yeah.
No,

839
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:13,800
I agree with you.
I mean,

840
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:17,280
I think that unwavering positivities 
usually delusional.

841
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,413
Yeah.
But a certain amount of positivity at 

842
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,771
schools.
Oh yeah,

843
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:23,720
of course.
A certain amount,

844
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,780
a certain amount of the dangerous.
It's like the faith healers,

845
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:28,614
right?
So the faith healing thing of you go 

846
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:31,410
away,
you don't take your pills,

847
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,340
and if this condition returns,
which it's going to,

848
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,940
it's your own fault because you didn't 
have enough faith right now that's quite

849
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:43,410
a toxic cycle of self blame.
It's exactly the same cycle that you get

850
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,790
when you read.
Like the secret,

851
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,800
for example,
says quite explicitly,

852
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,930
if these great things don't come your 
way,

853
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,020
it's because your self believer wavered 
for a second.

854
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,540
You only have yourself to blame.
She's very explicit about that.

855
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,820
Um,
and that,

856
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:56,780
that's the problem.
It's it,

857
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,270
it's great if you can put it in a 
certain context.

858
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:01,920
If not,
it's sadly can be a recipe,

859
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:02,754
I think for anxiety and just a feeling 
of failure that you don't understand 

860
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,224
where it's come from.

861
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,333
Well,
but I was trying to get at was I wonder 

862
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:13,230
if it's a component in a much larger 
picture.

863
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,480
Not that it's the one thing like the 
key,

864
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,333
like the real problem with the secret is
the idea that you're taking all these 

865
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:23,100
people that are already successful,
they've achieved a certain result,

866
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,010
and then you're asking them,
how did you achieve that result?

867
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,870
Well,
I thought positive and I just really put

868
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:31,200
my mind to it and I dreamt on it.
They all have this in common.

869
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,070
Well,
you know,

870
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,320
who also thought positive bunch of 
losers.

871
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:38,430
They tried and you know,
they got hit in the head by asteroids or

872
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,310
car accidents or the world turned bad on
them.

873
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,230
That actually can happen too.
Yeah.

874
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,060
So it's just,
you're using,

875
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,870
you have a biased focus group executive 
about it.

876
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,531
Yes,
exactly.

877
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:49,301
It's exactly.
And,

878
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,134
and the,
the idea of setting a goal fixating on 

879
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:53,514
it and ignoring all the haters and 
ignoring all the people that will bring 

880
00:37:55,591 --> 00:38:00,591
you down is a perfect recipe for failure
as much as it's a common anecdotal,

881
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:02,130
a story of success.

882
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,993
Well,
the problem with that is if you just 

883
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:04,944
focus on the one.
The thing about human beings I think is 

884
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,303
that we really do need other people's 
input and interaction and the idea that 

885
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:13,074
you're going to work in a vacuum and 
create this great masterpiece without 

886
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:18,180
any interaction with other human beings 
as doesn't really.

887
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,073
It doesn't really work like that.
It doesn't because life is active and 

888
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:26,100
messy and ambiguous and ambivalent.
And W I think the trouble is we get hung

889
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,640
up on nouns like happiness or meaning or
even the self,

890
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,490
right?
Because I think,

891
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,370
I think actually these things are verbs 
there.

892
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,830
Webby we sell as a verb.
You know,

893
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:35,664
maybe something that happens dynamically
in the relationships that were maybe 

894
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,024
ourself is something that kind of 
extends out into the world and is kind 

895
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:44,230
of fluid in that way.
And happiness maybe is.

896
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,870
Maybe that's an activity,
meaning is maybe an activity,

897
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:49,750
but we,
w we reduce these things to nouns.

898
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:51,850
Like they're really neat,
easy,

899
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:54,700
isolated things and uh,
they're really not.

900
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:58,090
So I can in a lot of the TV shows that I
do,

901
00:38:58,091 --> 00:38:58,924
I'm putting people through like a 
transformative process and they're 

902
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,140
reacting to kind of really extreme 
situations.

903
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,920
And I always had people saying,
oh,

904
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,893
I wouldn't do that love already,
but think it's all fate because I would 

905
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:12,364
never do that.
But they're viewing themselves as this 

906
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,063
isolated.
There's just this sort of individual 

907
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,093
kind of separated from everything else.
Watching that and thinking how they 

908
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:22,000
behave,
what they're not doing is thinking.

909
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:27,190
And if I were in that situation with the
same pressures and then that's,

910
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,790
that's amazing that that does changes 
that were not there for two,

911
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,310
300 years.
We've had this idea that we are,

912
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:38,311
these kind of all goes back to like not 
being influenced by kings and priests.

913
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,570
Like it was John Locke.
It's like the,

914
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,240
the beginnings of that,
that idea that,

915
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:46,500
no,
no,

916
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:46,961
we,
we,

917
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:47,741
uh,
we should not,

918
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:48,574
we should have this kind of personal 
authority and it's drifted into a 

919
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,953
through can't.
I think it's drifted into a really 

920
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:57,490
unrealistic and unfair sense of how 
isolated beyond we're not.

921
00:39:57,491 --> 00:40:00,370
We're clearly social creatures.
I,

922
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,050
there's a show on Netflix called the 
push,

923
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,400
uh,
which I did,

924
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:08,401
which was to see whether,
if you create this environment of social

925
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:10,120
compliance.
So it's a big party,

926
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:11,740
right?
There's one guy and it doesn't know that

927
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:13,900
this is being filmed,
that is part of a TV show.

928
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,780
Everybody else is an actor.
And the plot was to see,

929
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,003
could you get him to murder somebody to 
push someone off the roof to the death 

930
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,560
as far as he's concerned.
Obviously it doesn't.

931
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,630
No one really dies.
Right?

932
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,970
And it just starts where he kind of gets
roped into helping out at this event.

933
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,340
And it's a big high stakes event.
Everyone's in,

934
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,110
um,
you know,

935
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,120
Tuxedos,
but he didn't get the memo for the dress

936
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:34,954
codes.
We already comes in feeling a bit and 

937
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,443
then he gets,
he gets roped into helping out and like 

938
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,340
the first thing is asked to do is to 
label,

939
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:43,174
um,
meat filled sausage roll snacks as 

940
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,440
vegetarian,
right?

941
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:48,274
Because they,
the vegetarian ones haven't been 

942
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:49,744
delivered.
So it's just like a little kind of foot 

943
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:53,740
in the door thing and it just builds and
it builds.

944
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,993
And,
uh,

945
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,403
it gets to this point when he's on a 
roof having been through this really 

946
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,443
dark,
extraordinary and sort of hilarious and 

947
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,810
massively anxiety,
juicing journeys,

948
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:05,644
a lot of emotions you go through and you
watch it and then faced with this 

949
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:10,540
massive pressure to,
to kill this guy.

950
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,374
And I don't want to,
don't want to spoil the ending because 

951
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:13,840
it's a stronger.
But um,

952
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,693
this is like,
it's,

953
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,840
that's what it's all about.
You know,

954
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,674
how your,
how your sense of like the story you 

955
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,350
tell yourself about who you are.
It's just,

956
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:24,184
isn't,
isn't,

957
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,760
isn't real casual about the new 
shipping,

958
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,170
about net are the sacrifice because 
anything you want.

959
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:30,820
But can I ask you one question about 
this?

960
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,010
What I mean,
do you feel

961
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
a certain sense of moral confusion when 
you're trying to talk someone into 

962
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:45,980
potentially and you realize that if this
wasn't a show,

963
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,353
if similar or maybe even more powerful 
pressures were in play and this guy was 

964
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:53,294
suggestible and he found himself in very
unusual circumstances where it seemed 

965
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:59,380
like a good idea to kill this person.
Like you're,

966
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:02,350
you're introducing this thought and 
this,

967
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:07,351
this scenario into a person's mind that 
perhaps could go cradle to the grave and

968
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,320
never have that.

969
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,930
It's,
it's kind of the opposite,

970
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:11,764
what it actually,
it's just hard to about giving away the 

971
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:15,364
ending,
but the,

972
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,260
what it does is actually mentally 
rehearse somebody.

973
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:21,094
What this guy took away from it is the 
knowledge that if he was ever in a 

974
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:26,164
situation again where there was anything
like that nature of compliance that he 

975
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:30,304
now has the tools to just like stand up 
to it because you need that kind of 

976
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,493
promotional.
And likewise for viewers hopefully 

977
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:37,930
watching it too.
That's kind of the idea.

978
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,970
You're all,
we're all emotionally rehearsing it with

979
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:40,804
him.
Um,

980
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,140
and unless you've been trained in staff 
and you know it like that,

981
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,490
you need like an emotional experience of
it to know when that thing happens,

982
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:50,890
to just have the resources to understand
that you can be manipulated.

983
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:52,130
These are very.
Although it does,

984
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:54,310
I realize it doesn't sound like it.
And that showed the purchase.

985
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:55,810
I mean,
it's kind of like the darkest of all the

986
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:56,644
shows,
but they are,

987
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,760
they are there for like a good reason.
There's like a,

988
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,250
there's a reason for doing it.
Everybody that comes away,

989
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:04,180
it was always like,
you know,

990
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,050
that's,
that,

991
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,600
that was a great thing to do.
Best thing I've ever done.

992
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,900
You know these even though the journeys 
themselves but do look very dark.

993
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,740
Well he sounds like the guy who had a 
positive outlook on it sounds like

994
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,960
it can learn from their mistakes.
Yeah.

995
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,910
But there's some people that when 
confronted with some new situation like,

996
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,773
wow,
I really was going to push that guy off 

997
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,230
the roof.
Like this is me.

998
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,064
Like I didn't think that was me.
Now I know now I know that I'm capable 

999
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:33,084
of doing that.
If I get manipulated to the point like 

1000
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,663
wow.
And then they have a lot of like real 

1001
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:39,290
confusion and,
and,

1002
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:40,124
and perhaps a lack of faith in 
themselves and their ability to make a 

1003
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:43,620
decision.
That's Kinda,

1004
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,340
that's Kinda my job to make sure that 
the framing and that,

1005
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:48,080
yeah,
that's kind of,

1006
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,913
you know,
I mean,

1007
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,160
I get these ethical questions that are 
worth asking.

1008
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,113
And ultimately my concern with these,
I've done a lot of these shows where 

1009
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:59,490
people are put through these dark 
journeys to reach a valuable point,

1010
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,710
much more valuable than perhaps the end 
of the porch,

1011
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:03,780
which is quite dog.

1012
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:04,830
But um,
the,

1013
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,663
my,
my only real concern is their 

1014
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,753
experience.
So the guy that has just done this new 

1015
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:11,611
show,
for example,

1016
00:44:11,611 --> 00:44:13,620
I said to him before I came out and 
started talking about the show,

1017
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:14,454
I said,
what do you want me to say about your 

1018
00:44:15,301 --> 00:44:16,140
experience?
And you said,

1019
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,570
aside from having my kids,
that is the best thing I've ever done.

1020
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,150
But I know other people watching the 
show will say,

1021
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:23,880
how can you now,
can you justify that you're manipulating

1022
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:26,580
somebody and why did you just want to 
kill you at the end of it?

1023
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:27,643
And that the reality is it's just this 
one guy's experience I care about and 

1024
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:32,634
that's something that I can manage and 
create and make sure that he's left in 

1025
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:36,774
the right way.
And also these are people I just like 

1026
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,600
we'll remain friends with for the rest 
of my life.

1027
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:41,400
So it's not like great,
you've done the TV show.

1028
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,100
Thank you.
Goodbye.

1029
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,190
This is,
there's a genuine,

1030
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:45,930
um,
intimate bond.

1031
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,711
Well,
we all,

1032
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:47,544
like,
we all end up falling in love with me 

1033
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:52,050
and the production team falling in love 
with these people because you're putting

1034
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:53,940
them through this like 10 month 
projects.

1035
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,300
Half was a little different with them 
sacrifice because he,

1036
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:58,243
um,
he thought he was taking part in one 

1037
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:00,084
show,
which was a documentary when actually 

1038
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,130
there was this whole other thing going 
on,

1039
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,330
but a lot of the time they have no idea 
how long was pushed for it.

1040
00:45:05,331 --> 00:45:07,130
Like push was.
Well that was only like,

1041
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:07,973
it.
That was like one evening of actual 

1042
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:11,660
filming,
but they,

1043
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,740
because it was just one light real time 
event,

1044
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,100
but the preparation for it,
you know,

1045
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:16,950
it goes back a bit.
I did,

1046
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:17,784
uh,
the biggest one was I did a show called 

1047
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,750
apocalypse,
which isn't on Netflix.

1048
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,583
I mean if you go down the rabbit hole,
it'll be somewhere on youtube where we 

1049
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:27,090
ended the world for somebody.
So we,

1050
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,870
we took control of his,
a news feed,

1051
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:35,640
a TV we filmed like special editions,
tv shows,

1052
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,300
new shows that watched,
fed them into a drip by drip,

1053
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:40,134
created the idea of the world was going 
to wait and there's going to be this 

1054
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:42,144
meteor strike even I could be out in the
cafe and the radio in the cafe because 

1055
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,580
we'd know we'd be in that cafe.
There's a radio playing with Djs that he

1056
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:50,490
knows that we're talking about this 
thing that is supposed to happen.

1057
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,913
And then we stage it.
We staged this pyrotechnic end of the 

1058
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:55,434
world thing and this kind of a sort of 
controlled enough environment we could 

1059
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,170
get them into where we could stay to 
that convincingly.

1060
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,243
And then he wakes up in the second 
episode to episode thing in this post 

1061
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,680
apocalyptic seemingly like weeks later 
in a hospital,

1062
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,210
like everyone's gone.

1063
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,940
The places abandoned,
um,

1064
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,900
uh,
some infection spreads.

1065
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,813
So there is like,
this is the plot and he then lives 

1066
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:20,094
through the plot of the wizard of Oz to 
find his way back home and the point of 

1067
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:23,184
it was this stoic idea of valuing what 
you have because this was somebody who 

1068
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,000
by all reports was,
you know,

1069
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,610
Lazy,
selfish,

1070
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,970
took advantage of his parents who was 
living with never had a proper job.

1071
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:35,520
It was just kinda like needed to value 
what he had said.

1072
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:36,610
The stoics would say,
you know,

1073
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,523
just rehearsed taking everything away.
So when you returned to the stuff you 

1074
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,164
have,
you valued that rather than just always 

1075
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:44,220
desiring more.
So that was that idea,

1076
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,920
kind of writ large,
take everything away and the world.

1077
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:47,783
But again,
like he was transformed by it really 

1078
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:51,270
changes.
You're still in touch with this person.

1079
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,960
Yeah,
absolutely.

1080
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,150
Yeah.
And so is this,

1081
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,550
this is a permanent shift,
permanent shifts.

1082
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:59,760
He ended up being a teacher in a special
needs school that has kind of worked his

1083
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:01,110
way up through and is now like,
you know,

1084
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:02,530
he's getting married and it's just.
Yeah,

1085
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,680
it's lovely.
That's crazy.

1086
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,480
I'm not that I can take credit for all 
of that,

1087
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:08,280
but you know,
it was definitely a big part of that.

1088
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,143
Well,
near death experiences are often 

1089
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:14,670
incredibly beneficial to people make big
giant shifts in their attitude and their

1090
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,833
perception of the world.
And I realize that time is finite and 

1091
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:19,374
then it could have been taken away from 
them and they feel like they have a new 

1092
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:22,260
lease on life.
I mean,

1093
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:24,900
you really can become a totally 
different person after something like,

1094
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,263
well,
that's what's happened with this guy 

1095
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:28,200
fills in the,
in the,

1096
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,210
in this new show,
which is also the first,

1097
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,520
like brand new thing I've done for,
for Netflix.

1098
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,020
There's a couple of other shows.
But what is it called?

1099
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,960
It's called sacrifice sacrifice.
So the plot is,

1100
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,810
I take this Guy Phil,
who is,

1101
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:42,070
uh,
an American guy,

1102
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,980
his father's,
his father's British British links,

1103
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:47,590
but he's an American guy living in 
Florida,

1104
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,520
Cocoa Beach,
Florida,

1105
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,760
big,
a right wing guy,

1106
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,893
strong views against immigration.
And I using these covert psychological 

1107
00:47:58,451 --> 00:47:59,284
techniques,
try and get him to the point where he 

1108
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:02,824
will willingly lay down his life and 
take a bullet for an illegal Mexican 

1109
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:09,950
immigrant already somebody believes is,
you know,

1110
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,470
it's an actor because it's the whole 
thing,

1111
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,330
whole thing with actors.
So,

1112
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:17,830
um,
so he went through this journey,

1113
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:20,350
which is not a,
it's not a political story at all.

1114
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:22,120
I mean,
obviously it kind of resonates,

1115
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:24,820
but it was ultimately a story about 
compassion and,

1116
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,250
and uh,
and humanity.

1117
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:30,130
And there's ultimately a very human 
moment that either he found himself in.

1118
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,290
Um,
and you know,

1119
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:35,740
the guys like made a huge difference to 
him.

1120
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:36,190
You know,
it's,

1121
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,610
it's a.
So this is,

1122
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,150
I got done a giveaway exactly how it 
turns out.

1123
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,760
The process take it was about 10 months 
there for him.

1124
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,130
For him it was like maybe three,
four months.

1125
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,750
It was like the beginning block of this 
year.

1126
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,540
But there's like two levels to make any 
shows you've got to write the I,

1127
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:52,403
you know,
that this is the plot of the show and 

1128
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:55,030
finding that and make that happen for 
him.

1129
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,550
But you've also got to create this whole
thing has,

1130
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:58,384
it's like the Truman show it,
you're creating a fiction for somebody 

1131
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:04,030
that has to be completely convincing.
That's a whole other level of,

1132
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,370
of kind of work.
Plus,

1133
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:07,204
you know,
you gotTa make sure this guy is robust 

1134
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:09,100
enough to go through something like 
that.

1135
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,160
So there's a whole vetting procedure 
that has to happen without him realizing

1136
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:14,170
what it's all about.
That's a great way of putting it.

1137
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:16,660
Robust bus psychologically,
right?

1138
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:17,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

1139
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,920
That is a crazy amount of preparation 
and production work.

1140
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,601
Is He?
Uh,

1141
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:22,141
it's,
it's,

1142
00:49:22,141 --> 00:49:22,974
it's huge in the apocalypse show.
That was like one moment when we had to 

1143
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:26,104
just make this guys because there was 
the idea that there's electrical 

1144
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:31,060
interference with the meteors just had 
to make his TV pop off in his room,

1145
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,760
like just sort of cut out and to do 
that,

1146
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:35,770
there were two guys out in his garden 
shed.

1147
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,173
I'm waiting.
Had to be there all day because I 

1148
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:39,844
couldn't come in and out of the garden 
because you might see them pulling a 

1149
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:42,814
cable at this moment to make the TV go.
But then they couldn't leave because he 

1150
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:46,384
might see them,
so they had to spend the night in this 

1151
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,160
garden shed and this is like after three
months of not having a day off as well.

1152
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:54,190
So that's like a nothing moment than 
normal ever remember from the show.

1153
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,820
But yeah,
a huge amount of huge amount of work.

1154
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:58,900
I always get people saying,
oh,

1155
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:00,190
it's all fake.
We haven't really done it.

1156
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:01,024
I think it's just that they won't 
believe you should actually go to all 

1157
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:05,700
that trouble for the paranoid.
Like if you,

1158
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:06,563
if you did that to a naturally paranoid 
person or person with a touch of 

1159
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:13,510
schizophrenia,
which is why they have to be vetted very

1160
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:14,344
carefully,
very carefully at any point during the 

1161
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:17,680
process.
Of course we can like stop it,

1162
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,400
I can,
you know,

1163
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,990
I can put that would suck,
wouldn't it?

1164
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:20,883
That would 10.
And they see a guy starting to question 

1165
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:27,070
reality and look at clouds in an odd 
way.

1166
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,880
Next thing you know.
Oh boy.

1167
00:50:28,881 --> 00:50:30,380
I think,
I think he's slipping away.

1168
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,000
Yes.
So yeah,

1169
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:32,720
that's never happened.

1170
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,460
It's always been,
it's always been hugely.

1171
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,340
Uh,
that is an amazing process though.

1172
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,443
I mean,
it's amazing how much prep work is 

1173
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:41,504
involved in something like that.
Just set up the radio where they walk 

1174
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:47,900
into a place to different news 
broadcast.

1175
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,530
I mean,
that is,

1176
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,363
that's fun.
The Tab most terrifying was the for him 

1177
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,183
was the kind of end of the world moment 
because we had this fake fake radio 

1178
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:56,474
broadcast from,
from the BBC and it was just so 

1179
00:50:57,951 --> 00:51:00,250
convincing.
It was just magic blood go cold.

1180
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,300
More of worlds type stuff.
But in this,

1181
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:04,940
like in this thing,
in a sacrifice,

1182
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:08,150
there was a,
like a amazing pivotal moment in it when

1183
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:08,984
he,
um,

1184
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,183
we do this staring tests which was 
developed by New York psychology 

1185
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:15,250
professor.
And the idea is you just,

1186
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,213
you might have come across it,
you just stare silently into someone's 

1187
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:18,974
eyes for four minutes and it's,
it's the most amazing thing because 

1188
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:24,254
obviously the first thing is you get 
listed of awkwardness and this kind of 

1189
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,983
giggling and,
and then that tends to stop and then 

1190
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:31,724
you're just facing a human being and 
like you've sort of somehow broken 

1191
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:38,120
through all the kind of crap.

1192
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,493
And then you just see like a person 
that's like living and struggling like 

1193
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:46,700
you are and someone with a private life 
that like,

1194
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:47,800
that's a big thing for me.
Like,

1195
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:48,131
you know,
we,

1196
00:51:48,131 --> 00:51:51,720
we,
we go through life seeing people general

1197
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,030
generally at their best light,
you know,

1198
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:55,460
generally people will present their best
version of themselves to you.

1199
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,413
If you have a couple over for dinner,
you'll tend to see that couple at their 

1200
00:51:58,491 --> 00:51:59,324
best.
So you had this skewed idea of how 

1201
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,350
together other people or how impressive 
other people are,

1202
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,410
how great other couples are compared to 
how you are with your partner.

1203
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:07,244
And we missed that like,
because we know for us we have this big 

1204
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,400
clumsy,
embarrassing,

1205
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,443
lumbering giant of a,
of a private life that's just following 

1206
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,200
us around and it's particularly now,
you know,

1207
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:21,990
with instagram and all that,
people are branding themselves.

1208
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,980
So,
I mean it's like,

1209
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,833
it's so unfair in terms of the 
difference between how you perceive 

1210
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,540
yourself and how you perceive everybody 
else.

1211
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,610
Um,
so again,

1212
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:34,920
you know,
there's the store is that we'd kind of a

1213
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,260
living out so that,
you know,

1214
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:40,280
it takes like four minutes of this 
bizarre staring thing to kind of reach a

1215
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:41,114
moment of just suddenly I think hitting 
a point of just seeing another human 

1216
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,650
being and everything that comes with 
that.

1217
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,780
And it was a big moment for this guy,
phil going through it.

1218
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:48,614
It was a really.
We tried a couple of things then that 

1219
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,710
you see in the shoulder don't work out 
quite well.

1220
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:52,544
And then um,
and then this a really emotional moment 

1221
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:59,870
when he,
he just has this big change.

1222
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,863
Yeah.
It's think also just being able to do a 

1223
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:04,544
TV show that really like changes 
somebody quite aside from how popular 

1224
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:11,270
the show is or how well it works as a 
show or who watches it,

1225
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:11,600
whatever.

1226
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,810
Just to actually feel like,
you know,

1227
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,033
at some point in my life I've done it a 
positive thing just for one person with 

1228
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:21,260
TV,
which is like,

1229
00:53:21,261 --> 00:53:23,300
you know,
generally kind of a pretty.

1230
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:24,134
I'm more authentic kind of medium.
So to be able to just do something 

1231
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,720
meaningful as you know is,
is good.

1232
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:31,620
Well,
listen to,

1233
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,320
it sounds amazing.
It doesn't just sound good.

1234
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:35,154
It sounds like quite a work of art that 
you've managed to figure out a way to 

1235
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:39,984
coordinate all these moving parts and 
trick someone into accepting a bunch of 

1236
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:50,280
different versions of reality that 
you're presenting to get these results.

1237
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,130
It said,
well,

1238
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,580
I've got a big production crew that 
will,

1239
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,371
you know,
it's not all of me.

1240
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:55,190
I've got to write the thing and he was 
on it.

1241
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:56,520
And so on that,
that the,

1242
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:58,950
um,
the we kind of worked on over the years.

1243
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:59,783
We had small,
like little things that involved a 

1244
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,390
involve those kinds of plots that,
that was the first show I did,

1245
00:54:06,391 --> 00:54:11,391
like that was taking a guy who,
if not as we fill in sacrifice and she's

1246
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,620
bringing out someone's here.
Right?

1247
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,513
That's really what it's about.
That's kind of the story you're seeing 

1248
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:22,180
somebody go through a big change,
but bringing out the hero and the um,

1249
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,290
the first show he did like that involve 
this guy who at the end of this,

1250
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:29,100
his own journey had been through,
finds himself on an airplane,

1251
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:31,360
is terrified of flying,
but he,

1252
00:54:31,361 --> 00:54:32,194
you know,
we created this situation where you had 

1253
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:34,740
to be on a flight and you didn't do 
anything to do with us.

1254
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:35,603
Everyone's an actor in the plane.
We've got hidden cameras throughout the 

1255
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:39,810
plane.
Then there's this,

1256
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,890
there is a medical emergency and will 
somebody land the plane?

1257
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:47,400
Someone needs to step up and do it.

1258
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,330
Yeah.
It's called here at 30,000

1259
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:52,164
feet.
Oh,

1260
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:53,823
I just,
just to talk through the edit because 

1261
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,490
it's not,
it's kind of a spoiler,

1262
00:54:56,491 --> 00:54:57,324
but it doesn't matter.
He,

1263
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,500
he,
he does it right.

1264
00:54:58,501 --> 00:55:00,540
He rises up,
has this moment.

1265
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:04,020
He goes to the cockpit.
Now he is highly suggestible.

1266
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:04,854
Right?
I've used him because he is suggestible 

1267
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,893
so I know that I can put them to sleep 
in a vertical was by clicking my 

1268
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:09,331
fingers.
Right.

1269
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:10,164
He's conditioned to that.
So I step out before he ended the 

1270
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:14,190
cockpit,
click my fingers,

1271
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:15,024
he sort of zonked out.
He's got very conditioned to this 

1272
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:18,390
throughout the process,
stick him in a wheelchair,

1273
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:22,290
we land the plane,
he wakes up in a,

1274
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:26,470
about to walk into one of those 
convincing simulators that they use for,

1275
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:27,930
uh,
for pilot training,

1276
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,450
uh,
and it's kind of a night flight.

1277
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:31,284
So that was,
we found out that was the most 

1278
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:33,360
convincing thing was to have it when 
it's dark.

1279
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,840
So he now goes in believing is in the 
cockpit of a real plane,

1280
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:37,770
30 feet,
30,000

1281
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:38,604
feet up in the air.
He's got the guy on ground control who 

1282
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:40,910
is,
you know,

1283
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:41,743
Internet obviously is everybody is 
talking him down getting into that on 

1284
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:48,030
the plane and he just,
it's just amazing.

1285
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:50,700
This,
this guy as in his mind,

1286
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:51,730
you know,
is landing,

1287
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,573
was playing,
saving the lives of 300 people and that 

1288
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:59,190
he steps out and then the thing is 
revealed to him and it's so emotional.

1289
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:00,390
And then there's a,
you know,

1290
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:01,224
the gaming means that Michael Douglas 
Philomena has always been a point of 

1291
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:05,770
reference for me.
So he comes out,

1292
00:56:05,771 --> 00:56:08,670
there's like a big party of everyone 
that's been on his journey,

1293
00:56:08,671 --> 00:56:10,290
all these people,
these actors that have been,

1294
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,510
you know,
taking it in this direction.

1295
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,860
Yeah.
So it was amazing.

1296
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:14,520
So I've,
I've,

1297
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,353
I've,
over the years kind of work with these 

1298
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:17,724
kind of,
uh,

1299
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:18,923
these plots,
these kind of immersive Truman show 

1300
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:25,660
style a plots while at the same time 
doing stage shows.

1301
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:27,370
I do,
I do a live show every year as well,

1302
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:28,204
which is kind of a bit more like an old 
fashioned sort of magic mind reading 

1303
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,220
kind of kind of show.
Um,

1304
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,710
but uh,
yeah they are,

1305
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:36,431
they are these,
you know,

1306
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:37,264
these extraordinary journeys.
But I just do like maybe one a year 

1307
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:39,340
because they take,
you know,

1308
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:39,810
they just,
it.

1309
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,180
So it seems like not only does it take 
too much time,

1310
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:43,014
but it also really,
you rely so heavily on the 

1311
00:56:44,341 --> 00:56:46,920
improvisational abilities of all these 
other people.

1312
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,540
Their ability to adjust an act normal 
and to be convincing.

1313
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,374
Yeah.
And to follow the plot and not deviate 

1314
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:55,430
at all.
And the LAS,

1315
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,980
because we used for sacrifice worse,
so good.

1316
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,853
It's just like,
it's just like in your blood or 

1317
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,520
whatever,
so,

1318
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,363
so good.
And they were like big at the end that 

1319
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:07,550
like big sort of aggressive racist biker
characters that we use.

1320
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,040
Terrifying.
And uh,

1321
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:11,623
yeah,
but just a hilarious thing of like they 

1322
00:57:13,111 --> 00:57:13,944
are because they were bikers as well,
so they are big like Harry intimidating 

1323
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:17,064
people.
But at the same time they want to know 

1324
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:19,860
about the motivation and whether they 
did a right listening.

1325
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:23,400
Got Artists bombed audio.
Odd combination.

1326
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,413
Wow.

1327
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,380
What a fantastic idea for a show.
And so uniquely original.

1328
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:29,543
I mean it just seems like there's so 
much work involved in something like 

1329
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,440
this.
You must obsess over that.

1330
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,280
I,
the process is I come up with an idea.

1331
00:57:41,281 --> 00:57:44,250
So like let's,
which is normally we normally sit,

1332
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:46,050
I sit with a couple of guys that are at 
the shows with.

1333
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,263
We normally drive themselves mad 
thinking of ideas and then one of us 

1334
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,860
normally me goes,
oh,

1335
00:57:52,861 --> 00:57:53,694
can't we just,
let's just end the world and it zombies 

1336
00:57:55,201 --> 00:57:56,034
all.
Let's a safe someone we can get someone 

1337
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:00,060
to push up off a building or with this 
one,

1338
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:00,894
because I'd done the push,
I wanted to kind of do the opposite of 

1339
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:04,500
it.
Something that we saving a life and much

1340
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:06,080
more redemptive story than,
than the.

1341
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:08,143
So the idea is the first thing and I try
and combine a really strong dramatic 

1342
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:14,610
hook with a really,
like a good reason for doing it.

1343
00:58:14,611 --> 00:58:17,250
Otherwise you're just making like a 
controversial,

1344
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,320
shocking thing for the same.
Which languages?

1345
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,620
No interest.
So a,

1346
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,613
well that's a beautiful perspective to 
that you actually want to benefit 

1347
00:58:25,741 --> 00:58:28,710
someone through this crazy prank you're 
playing on them.

1348
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:29,371
Yeah.
Yeah.

1349
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:30,001
Otherwise,
exactly.

1350
00:58:30,001 --> 00:58:31,910
It would just be a crazy horrible.
And there's,

1351
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,253
there is like part of the enjoyment of 
the show I guess is a little bit of 

1352
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,440
that.
It's kind of a little bit,

1353
00:58:37,441 --> 00:58:38,380
but that's,
that's uh,

1354
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:39,923
the,
the,

1355
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:40,761
you know,
the,

1356
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:41,594
the shows.
I think they have a lot of heart and a 

1357
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:44,754
lot of them

1358
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:46,903
thought you were intended to be 
beneficial to these people is what 

1359
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:52,460
transforms that you have empathy for 
these folks.

1360
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:53,191
Yeah.
And you,

1361
00:58:53,191 --> 00:58:54,024
you,
you truly care that that alone makes 

1362
00:58:56,331 --> 00:58:59,240
everything else better.
It makes the whole,

1363
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,403
if the whole thing is just like,
I'm smarter than these dummies and I'm 

1364
00:59:02,211 --> 00:59:04,940
just going to trick them and we've had 
that show before many,

1365
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:05,774
many times and make people feel terrible
and it's cringe inducing when you watch 

1366
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:13,160
it and you can't look away,
but that you are doing this.

1367
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:14,653
And the end result is actually a 
benefits their perspective and actually 

1368
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:21,260
might change their life for the better.
That's extraordinary.

1369
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,070
Amazing.

1370
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,671
Thank you.
Well that's,

1371
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:23,630
that's,
that's the hope.

1372
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,753
The way that I do it,
the way that I changed them is through 

1373
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,310
conditioning.
So I,

1374
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,320
um,
this is a technique I've used a lot over

1375
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:31,154
the years.
Have you kind of take the emotional 

1376
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:36,870
state you want the person to have at the
end a,

1377
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:40,280
break it down into components and then 
attach each one of those to a,

1378
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,600
to a trigger.
So this guy,

1379
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:43,110
Phil,
uh,

1380
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,800
in sacrifice is using,
um,

1381
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,090
I can app which he thinks is sort of 
talking to this.

1382
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:50,924
I'm at the microchip.
He hasn't him because he thinks he 

1383
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:53,714
thinks we can.
We really do like cut him open and 

1384
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,481
seemingly.
Yeah,

1385
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:57,200
we just don't,
you know,

1386
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,610
it's a placebo.
We don't really put it in.

1387
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,530
But now you do cut them.
Yeah.

1388
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:03,170
We caught him and stitch it back up.
Yeah.

1389
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:03,900
Wow.
Um,

1390
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,850
I don't think it needs that.

1391
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,960
Don't need stitches for.
It's kind of a small car,

1392
01:00:06,961 --> 01:00:09,950
but it's a scaffold going in normal.
Um,

1393
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:15,190
so he thinks he's using this app which 
is kind of helping motivate him but what

1394
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:17,180
it's doing,
it's attached.

1395
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,073
It's giving him this sound like this 
little jingle that gets attached to all 

1396
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:25,670
those feelings of motivation.
So that means that when he finds himself

1397
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:30,470
in this kind of final scene where he has
this choice to step in and save a life,

1398
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,790
that we can have the same jingle on the 
radio that plays and you know,

1399
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,460
it's like that thing of you hear a song 
when you're breaking up with someone and

1400
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:38,294
it's a horrible period of your life and 
then five years later you hear the same 

1401
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:44,290
solid and it just brings it all back.
That process or obviously like you know,

1402
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,930
advertising as the big example of that 
is the premise behind something like the

1403
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:48,764
Manchurian candidate that there's some 
way they can snap and then you go back 

1404
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:52,994
to the state of mind.

1405
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,940
That's more kind of,
I guess overtly hypnotic.

1406
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:57,700
That's like a post hypnotic suggestion.
This isn't,

1407
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:00,620
this is more gentle because he needed to
make the decision himself.

1408
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,533
The idea was not that it'd be some kind 
of hypnotized robot if that would even 

1409
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:05,540
work.
Anyway,

1410
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:05,870
you know,
this,

1411
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,930
this is,
this is about creating a trigger.

1412
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:09,843
Those feelings of empathy are important.
A lot of the shows about empathy and a 

1413
01:01:12,011 --> 01:01:16,490
lot of the show is about the desire to 
act and then he's,

1414
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,430
he finds himself in this situation,
which is extreme.

1415
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:21,264
He has no idea at this point.
It's anything to do with the filmings 

1416
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,770
finished that will happen in England as 
far as the concerned is gone back home.

1417
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,613
We had time to forget all about it and 
then ends up stranded in this situation 

1418
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:31,380
where it all happens.
Um,

1419
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,230
and then I trigger these things off.

1420
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,080
So I'm giving him this kind of 
psychological nudge and then it's,

1421
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:37,760
you know,
what,

1422
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,561
what will happen,
will he,

1423
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,240
will he,
will he rise up and take it like that,

1424
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:41,870
the guy landing the plane.
It's kind of like what,

1425
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,460
what,
what ultimately,

1426
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:45,960
you know,
it's that guy's decision and it's also,

1427
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:50,120
I think it's a story about stepping out 
of the kind of,

1428
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:52,440
the,
you know,

1429
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,273
the,
the,

1430
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:56,910
I guess the show resonates politically,
but it's not a political show that the,

1431
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,553
there's like there were political 
narratives we get constrained by and we 

1432
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:04,810
forget that attitude to the dialogue 
between the sides that you know,

1433
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,940
where humanity emerges and will we find 
truth.

1434
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:08,803
So this is also,
I guess a story about a guy coming out 

1435
01:02:11,151 --> 01:02:11,984
of his particular sociopolitical 
narrative and just finding something 

1436
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:20,280
that ultimately is just a human,
a human quality,

1437
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:21,180
kindness,
compassion.

1438
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,950
And these are not political qualities.

1439
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,450
Although they ended up getting 
politicized,

1440
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:25,800
but they're not,
they're not.

1441
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:29,220
I think there are a lot of people are 
gonna Watch this and want that to happen

1442
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:30,054
to them.
Like I need some sort of a 

1443
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:35,961
transformative prank played on me to be.
I think people do.

1444
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:40,020
We do get caught and ruts right,
and we do get stuck on momentum.

1445
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:43,500
We get stuck following the same patterns
over and over again.

1446
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:48,501
It's very difficult to change your life.
This is the thing that makes us so great

1447
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,553
at evolving.
Our ability to adapt is the same thing 

1448
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:54,030
that just.
It ties us down.

1449
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:54,864
So like all through life.
So from an early age like we merged in 

1450
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:57,864
this world and we're very quickly given 
messages about what our relationship 

1451
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,530
with that ship to that world is.
This is what people are like,

1452
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,640
this is what they want from you.

1453
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,310
You are not powerful.
The world is powerful,

1454
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:09,200
you know,
and that that is,

1455
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:13,320
it's going to be skewed.
You said that I love this,

1456
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:17,460
that the greatest burden a child has to 
bear is the unlived life of its parents.

1457
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:18,623
Such a great thing to your starting 
point is this skewed story and then you 

1458
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:27,410
just go through life looking for things 
that just fit and recreate that.

1459
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,370
Those patents because they feel so 
comfortable.

1460
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:30,204
You know,
you're what you learned about love from 

1461
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:33,324
your parents.
You've start to bring to your adult 

1462
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:38,970
relationships and project all that stuff
on a,

1463
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,380
on your partner.
If you think about,

1464
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:41,214
you know,
the,

1465
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,983
if you've had a nice loving upbringing,
you are getting a ridiculously skewed 

1466
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:48,204
version of what love means.
Like we know as adults how difficult it 

1467
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,170
is raising kids.
We never saw that as kids.

1468
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:54,780
We never saw our parents going off and 
screaming at each other.

1469
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:58,270
The next room wants to be going to bed.
We just have this sort of impossibly uh,

1470
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,021
hopefully,
you know,

1471
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:00,930
if we've had a,
had a happy one,

1472
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:02,820
we'd get this impossible,
um,

1473
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,010
template of what love is and should be.
And then we just dumped that on the poor

1474
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,710
adult partners which nobody can live up 
to.

1475
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,633
So our ability to adapt,
to internalize stories about who we are 

1476
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:18,680
and then like mistake that for reality 
is just a,

1477
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:24,910
is just what makes living just difficult
and complex.

1478
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:25,764
And also the narratives that come 
through fiction narratives from films 

1479
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:34,401
and books and songs.
The versions of romance and.

1480
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:37,110
Yes,
particularly with that.

1481
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,890
Yeah,
I love the idea that I'm done.

1482
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:44,120
If you never landed Bhutan is a British 
philosopher and writer and he said,

1483
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:44,973
you know,
if you go to bed twice a week with your 

1484
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:49,360
partner thinking,
oh,

1485
01:04:49,361 --> 01:04:51,990
the fuck am I doing with this person,
that's normal.

1486
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,330
That's a normal thing.
I like.

1487
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:57,200
To me that's more useful information 
than you know,

1488
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:00,690
how to make your relationship perfect.
These things aren't perfect and again,

1489
01:05:00,691 --> 01:05:01,524
living,
living with the understanding that you 

1490
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:04,670
know,
life is devoted.

1491
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:07,170
What about three times a week,
three times a week.

1492
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:08,670
I think that's probably pretty normal as
well.

1493
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:12,240
In general,
what's the number where you should start

1494
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,940
to read?
Five.

1495
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,500
Two good nights.
We have two good nights though.

1496
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,680
Five nights a hell of a two of them.
She's the best.

1497
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,510
Yeah.
What do you do?

1498
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,493
What do you do?

1499
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,453
Yeah,
I think the.

1500
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:28,210
The narratives that we get from fiction 
or they're very confusing to people,

1501
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,340
particularly people that are very 
romantic,

1502
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:31,174
they have these ideas that their life is
going to be like one of their favorite 

1503
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:35,890
films and that that's what they're 
looking for.

1504
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:39,910
They're holding out there,
holding out for when the music plays in,

1505
01:05:39,911 --> 01:05:41,260
the closeup is there and

1506
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:44,450
and those stories stopped.
Going back to this guy mandible.

1507
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,433
Tony wrote a lovely book on this.
Those fit the trouble with those films 

1508
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:48,114
that those stories.
They stopped when the people fall in 

1509
01:05:49,591 --> 01:05:51,250
love and get together.
That's what.

1510
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:52,343
That's when it starts.
That's when the tough stuff starts that 

1511
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:54,654
we could do with some good strong 
fictional frameworks to sort of absorb 

1512
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:00,600
that.
That's when the tufts stop.

1513
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,090
It's like it's like death.
It's the same thing,

1514
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:03,781
isn't it?
We have no.

1515
01:06:03,781 --> 01:06:04,614
We've kind of lost touch with the 
cultural narratives around death that 

1516
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:09,720
gave it some meetings and now when it 
happens,

1517
01:06:09,721 --> 01:06:10,554
it's just as absurd,
scary thing that we don't know what to 

1518
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,094
do with.
The only narrative we have that we have 

1519
01:06:15,691 --> 01:06:16,321
absorbed,
I guess,

1520
01:06:16,321 --> 01:06:19,110
is that of the brave battle at someone's
fighting,

1521
01:06:19,111 --> 01:06:19,944
which is so unhelpful for the person 
that's in that situation makes everyone 

1522
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:22,914
else made me feel better,
but just adds like eventual failure and 

1523
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:28,440
letting everyone else down to this 
person's burdens.

1524
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:30,030
It was what they should,
what they should.

1525
01:06:30,031 --> 01:06:33,120
What we should feel in that at that time
is you know,

1526
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:36,060
that this is,
this is when we can bring out if we have

1527
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:39,310
the opportunity to bring our stories to 
some kind of ending,

1528
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:40,100
you know,
if you watch,

1529
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:40,933
if you watch a film or read a book,
that final scene makes sense of 

1530
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:46,080
everything that's happened before.
This doesn't happen in live.

1531
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:46,914
It is kind of.
And so we should be like author of our 

1532
01:06:51,451 --> 01:06:55,560
stories more than at any point before 
death.

1533
01:06:55,561 --> 01:06:56,760
And you know,
if we have the opportunity,

1534
01:06:56,790 --> 01:07:00,680
what happens is the opposite.
We become like cameos in this story,

1535
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:02,430
you know,
the main characters or our loved ones or

1536
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:05,610
the doctors or people making all these 
decisions and we kind of get sidelined.

1537
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:10,910
So yeah,
these fictional or mythical storage,

1538
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:11,914
just these things that just give us a 
sense of where our experience fits into 

1539
01:07:14,581 --> 01:07:15,780
a wider sense of meaning.
We've,

1540
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:16,560
you know,
we've,

1541
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,920
we've kind of lost touch with that the 
last couple of hundred years and there's

1542
01:07:19,921 --> 01:07:22,050
a lot of good stuff that's come with 
that because we've embraced,

1543
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:22,884
you know,
science and knowledge at the expense of 

1544
01:07:24,631 --> 01:07:25,770
superstition.
Of course,

1545
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,970
but I,
you know,

1546
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,800
we've kind of lost touch of something so
we've lost a little bit of touch with

1547
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,713
nature and the natural laws of things 
living in dying and I think we as human 

1548
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:39,154
beings today are probably more alienated
from particularly the death of farm 

1549
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:47,440
animals and things along those lines.
Like where,

1550
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:50,470
where our food comes from,
like actually seeing death.

1551
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:52,930
Even if your dog is sick,
you bring him to the vet,

1552
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:54,760
the vet puts them down,
you know,

1553
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:55,594
all these things that people probably 
experienced firsthand for hundreds and 

1554
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,093
hundreds of years,
particularly like raising animals and 

1555
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:05,560
that is done is just completely removed 
from the equation.

1556
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,210
Those folks.
Yeah.

1557
01:08:07,211 --> 01:08:08,044
That sort of embodied dialog or that 
dialogue with ecology with nature is 

1558
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:17,821
interested in.
There's like view of like what,

1559
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:22,240
what the kind of indigenous peoples,
uh,

1560
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,480
well,
like dad,

1561
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:24,314
you have to shame and our view of what 
the Shaman is is so skewed by our kind 

1562
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:28,760
of western mode.
The,

1563
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:29,983
what the,
the tapping into is not like it isn't 

1564
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,070
the supernatural.
That's not sort of the,

1565
01:08:35,071 --> 01:08:36,920
um,
that's not really the mode what you have

1566
01:08:36,921 --> 01:08:38,770
and you still have it in these,
uh,

1567
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:41,420
indigenous peoples that sort of say live
like,

1568
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:43,910
um,
rural Asia and so on that were,

1569
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:44,744
these,
these,

1570
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,950
these ways of living is still going on,
is what's,

1571
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:51,350
what's clear is it's not the 
supernatural,

1572
01:08:51,351 --> 01:08:52,610
it isn't the spirit,
it's,

1573
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:57,280
it's all about a really easy 
relationship with the natural world.

1574
01:08:57,281 --> 01:08:58,114
So an example of this is a great book 
called the spell of the sensuous by 

1575
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,020
David Abrams,
who actually was a magician originally.

1576
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,360
He went out and lived amongst his people
and he eats,

1577
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,130
he talks about this and he said there 
was a,

1578
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:10,100
he was staying in this compound,
this shamans compound.

1579
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,910
And the,
um,

1580
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:15,860
the shamans wife would bring him some 
fruit every morning,

1581
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,053
but you also had these little like 
banana leaves with Rice in and she 

1582
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:20,384
would,
she was going off and doing something 

1583
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:21,794
else with those and he asked where they 
were going and should all those for the 

1584
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:25,070
spirits of the house.
Right.

1585
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,263
So what,
and then she'd come back and without 

1586
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:30,980
them we were just wondering kind of what
that meant and what he was doing.

1587
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:33,690
So one day he just kind of followed and 
watched.

1588
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,533
Gentry was placing these little pockets 
of these little things of rice out 

1589
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:37,964
around the perimeter of this compound 
and he was watching it and from a 

1590
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,950
distance and he saw the rice start to 
move and yet a moment of like,

1591
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:47,710
oh,
this is the spirit,

1592
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:48,530
what is this?

1593
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,810
And then the rise moved along the ground
and you've,

1594
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,673
oh,
it's aunts,

1595
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,750
it's aunt.
So what she's actually doing,

1596
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:57,170
she's putting out rice for the ants.
So then he had the thought of,

1597
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,250
Oh,
it isn't spirits,

1598
01:09:58,251 --> 01:09:59,084
it's just ants.
And then you realize now of course the 

1599
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:02,840
ants kind of are the spirits,
right?

1600
01:10:02,841 --> 01:10:07,130
So this is a house where food is 
prepared or they have a lot of,

1601
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:08,063
of big events.
And an ant infestation would be just 

1602
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:11,763
disastrous for them.
So the spirit of the offering to the 

1603
01:10:14,691 --> 01:10:17,450
spirits of the house is a kind of a 
dialogue with the answer is going to,

1604
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:19,970
if we were going to put this rice out,
can you just,

1605
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:21,980
if you just have the rise,
if we do this every day,

1606
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:23,410
will you leave us alone?
Um,

1607
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:28,280
and then that's it.
Like it's,

1608
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,173
it's kind of that it's quite simple 
dialogue and I sort of this lovely kind 

1609
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:37,940
of embodied relationship with nature 
that of course we're so far from here.

1610
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:38,953
So interestingly,
we do tend to pack a lot of ideas into 

1611
01:10:41,001 --> 01:10:41,370
the,
you know,

1612
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,203
the supernatural even like the 
unconscious and depth psychology and so 

1613
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:47,720
much I'm a big fan of,
but we can take all this,

1614
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,600
the unknown stuff and shove it into 
these kinds of bottomless pits.

1615
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,000
Whereas actually,
interestingly,

1616
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:55,010
if you trace it back,
it seems like it just wasn't like that.

1617
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:55,960
It was this very,
uh,

1618
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,333
well it doesn't,
it depends on what they're doing is 

1619
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:04,430
particularly with Sherman Sherman is 
concentrating on psychedelic drugs.

1620
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,633
They're an Iowaska church and they're 
giving people dimethyltryptamine like 

1621
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:13,040
this is the,
they are dealing with the supernatural.

1622
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,460
A very bizarre

1623
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,533
and intense transformative experience 
they're putting people through and 

1624
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:24,090
there's different like that term Shaman.
It really,

1625
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:29,780
it kind of was very rare,
very rare to be discussed up until about

1626
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:31,284
maybe 20 plus years ago and it seems 
like there's been some sort of a 

1627
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:38,970
psychedelic revolution over the last 
couple of decades and it's almost become

1628
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:42,630
a little bit too popular here were a 
bunch of people are profiting from it or

1629
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,464
they're.
They're opportunists and they're their 

1630
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:49,260
labeling themselves as shaman.
I think the term that they use in Peru,

1631
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:51,210
they call them plastic Shazam and,
and they're,

1632
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:52,044
they're setting up shop and putting 
together this Iowasca brew and having 

1633
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:57,900
all these Americans come in,
fly in and Europeans are looking for,

1634
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,370
you know,
air quote,

1635
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:04,400
spiritual experience and these are not 
necessarily pure shaman and the greatest

1636
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:07,200
sense of the word.
It's a different.

1637
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,600
This is what we think of when we think 
of Shaman today.

1638
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,910
We think of someone who conducts a 
psychedelic ritual.

1639
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,940
Exactly.
Which I know very little of you know,

1640
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,680
you've had any experience.
I'm excited if I put,

1641
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:17,743
you know,
real real coffee with DECAF and how 

1642
01:12:20,011 --> 01:12:21,750
come?
Why haven't you tried something?

1643
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,340
Nothing.
Psilocybin.

1644
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,210
Nothing.
No,

1645
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:26,250
I never even smoked a cigarette or 
anything.

1646
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:26,910
It's,
it's,

1647
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:27,743
it's a real magicians thing.
It's kind of like a pendulum like that 

1648
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,921
too.
Yeah,

1649
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:32,754
it's very common instead of A.
I think it's like a new robotic control 

1650
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:38,310
thing during that period where if you're
going to do it,

1651
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:39,690
you're going to be doing it then and 
then,

1652
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,813
and then that kind of time policies and 
it just ends up being something that 

1653
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,360
gets missed.
A lot of magicians don't drink.

1654
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:49,194
Don't smoke.
Penn had the strangest response when I 

1655
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:53,370
asked him about that.
He said,

1656
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:55,890
uh,
I think we figured out everything we can

1657
01:12:55,891 --> 01:12:56,970
from those things already.

1658
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:59,290
But you have it.
Yeah.

1659
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,360
You haven't,
you,

1660
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:02,203
you've learned.
We've learned everything we can learn 

1661
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:07,220
from these psychedelic trips was with 
his perception was you.

1662
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,120
I don't know if he's amended that since 
then.

1663
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:11,220
This was over a decade ago.
We had this conversation,

1664
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:15,060
but that thought process is fascinating 
to me because,

1665
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:15,670
uh,
well,

1666
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:16,503
you mean you're talking about like this 
transformative experience that you've 

1667
01:13:18,331 --> 01:13:21,300
put through people through with these 
shows set and setting them up these,

1668
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,493
you know,
they think the world is different and 

1669
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:25,650
changed and then they changed because of
that.

1670
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,260
I think what we're missing is,
uh,

1671
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,440
is a,
uh,

1672
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:31,223
it's the,
it's the experience of transcendence 

1673
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:33,640
that's important.
Yeah.

1674
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:34,503
Really,
religions originally gave people that 

1675
01:13:37,101 --> 01:13:37,934
there was a time in history where were a
religion was being born and it was 

1676
01:13:42,981 --> 01:13:43,814
giving people of phenomenal logical,
embodied experience of the transcendent 

1677
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,640
whatever that was,
whatever that meant.

1678
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:52,640
And then time moves on and then that 
kind of moves out of living memory.

1679
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:55,380
And so you kind of have to need to 
recreate it,

1680
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,433
recreated feelings through practices.
And then there's practices start to 

1681
01:13:59,901 --> 01:14:03,320
becoming a rituals and dogma.
And by this point you're creating a sort

1682
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:08,090
of recreating a belief,
but the sort of the embodied experiences

1683
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:10,040
sort of kind of faded into the 
background.

1684
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,173
And then,
you know,

1685
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,213
I'm,
I'm a,

1686
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,173
I'm an atheist,
but that I could see that what you're 

1687
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:19,450
left with thousands of years later is,
is quite easy to knock down.

1688
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,150
Um,
I'm kind of poke fun of.

1689
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:24,280
But actually it's at some level,
I think it's,

1690
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,173
it is not doing a very good job of 
pointing back to the original 

1691
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:31,060
experience,
the importance of transcendence.

1692
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:31,894
Now you can diy spiritualize that 
doesn't have to be about anything 

1693
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:34,534
overtly spiritual,
but like finding something bigger than 

1694
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:41,800
yourself in life and throwing yourself 
into that thing is how we find meaning,

1695
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:42,634
right?
Meaning trump's happiness or anything 

1696
01:14:43,511 --> 01:14:46,060
else.
And that might be through your kids.

1697
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:48,880
And I guess this is why people generally
sort of,

1698
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,950
we have kids at a certain point,
you know,

1699
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:53,640
our ego gets to sort of step down,
um,

1700
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:55,480
so that,
you know,

1701
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,570
that that's.
And if what we,

1702
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,653
what we do instead,
I guess hence the interest in these 

1703
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:04,450
dodgy Shamans,
we just put it in all the wrong places,

1704
01:15:04,451 --> 01:15:05,081
money,
fame,

1705
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:07,810
and so on that don't supply it.
They do not supply those feelings.

1706
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:09,760
Transcendence,
we think they will because we think,

1707
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:10,594
you know,
rich and glamorous life will lift us up 

1708
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:15,680
and out of our boring everyday lives,
but of course you know,

1709
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,260
they don't work.
There's something.

1710
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,860
There's something about that 
relationship to the mysterious that even

1711
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,900
even me as an atheist and the rest of 
it,

1712
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:24,430
I kind of.
It's important.

1713
01:15:24,431 --> 01:15:25,264
We have to have that somewhere.
Someone realize that needs to be some 

1714
01:15:27,581 --> 01:15:30,760
kind of space for that.
It doesn't need to be anything.

1715
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:31,643
I'm spiritual.
It just is a kind of a respect for and 

1716
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:39,130
understanding that serving something 
bigger than yourself,

1717
01:15:39,131 --> 01:15:41,540
whatever,
whatever that is and whoever knows is is

1718
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,740
a important part of being human.

1719
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,230
I liked it.
That keeps coming back to you.

1720
01:15:46,231 --> 01:15:49,590
This recognition of your work as being 
something that's bigger than yourself.

1721
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:50,424
You pour yourself into this and through 
that experience you somehow transcend 

1722
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:55,950
that.
Something comes out of it,

1723
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:56,361
you,
you,

1724
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:59,640
you,
you grow with the creation of this thing

1725
01:15:59,641 --> 01:16:03,180
in some way and while it's happening,
you're about as alive as you can be.

1726
01:16:03,181 --> 01:16:04,014
Right?

1727
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,330
Me,
well I'm,

1728
01:16:05,331 --> 01:16:09,670
I'm happy if my breath is decent at four
in the afternoon.

1729
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:10,813
I have very,
very low ambitions with the business 

1730
01:16:13,081 --> 01:16:13,870
stuff,
but it's.

1731
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,780
But it's for the,
certainly for the guys going through it,

1732
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:16,623
other people going through it,
I hope it gives them a profound and 

1733
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:26,860
transformative experience for me.
I,

1734
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:28,803
I get very,
I get kind of a bit low if I'm not 

1735
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,650
actively engaged in something creative 
so that,

1736
01:16:34,651 --> 01:16:35,860
that,
that is important for me,

1737
01:16:35,861 --> 01:16:36,281
but I,
you know,

1738
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:37,114
the painting or whatever.
These are all things that you were 

1739
01:16:38,531 --> 01:16:39,070
referring to

1740
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:42,160
to the painting and the exact same way.
Something bigger than yourself.

1741
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

1742
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,193
That's projects.
Something to occupy your mind and your 

1743
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:49,630
spirit and your creative juices.

1744
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:50,610
Yeah.
It's,

1745
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:51,930
that's,
I think that's a really.

1746
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,640
It's a,
it's a vital part of your life.

1747
01:16:56,641 --> 01:16:58,350
Making sense of some,
you know,

1748
01:16:58,351 --> 01:17:00,930
the people sadly that throw themselves 
off buildings.

1749
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,130
It's not,
they're unhappy.

1750
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:04,620
It's that they've normally,
there's no meaning has gone that,

1751
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:05,670
that's,
that's the real,

1752
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,563
that's the real killer is lack of 
meaning and we find meaning through 

1753
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,620
throwing ourselves into something bigger
and recognizing that.

1754
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:13,483
And you know,
I think maybe the reason why this sort 

1755
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:15,794
of work on myth and so on is he's sort 
of feeling like it's coming back into 

1756
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:20,744
the back into the dialogue now is bs 
because it's something that's something 

1757
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:27,560
kind of real brackets fictional to kind 
of,

1758
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:28,540
you know,
to,

1759
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,890
to hang onto these.
This is important.

1760
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,733
They are the I think are articulate.
Something that's needs to be recognized 

1761
01:17:34,451 --> 01:17:38,600
and somehow honored within within life.

1762
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,573
Do you know Tyson furious.
He's a British heavyweight boxer who's 

1763
01:17:43,031 --> 01:17:47,260
the lineal heavyweight champion and he 
went through severe depression.

1764
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:52,180
He won the title from Vladimir Klitschko
who had held it for many,

1765
01:17:52,181 --> 01:17:53,014
many years and beat him and then felt 
like he accomplished his goals and just 

1766
01:17:58,211 --> 01:18:01,300
went into a real bad funk,
gained a ton of weight,

1767
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:02,134
started drinking every night,
carrying on and got suicidal and was 

1768
01:18:05,621 --> 01:18:06,454
thinking about driving his Ferrari into 
a bridge and then decided that he was 

1769
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:14,590
going to make another run at the 
heavyweight championship.

1770
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,453
And so through all this depression and 
suicidal thoughts and all these 

1771
01:18:18,341 --> 01:18:22,450
different things,
what turned him around was goal setting.

1772
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:27,340
The idea that he had something to work 
towards and something to live for,

1773
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:31,500
and then getting in shape and then 
forcing himself to be on this path,

1774
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:33,370
try to achieve that goal.
Um,

1775
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:35,800
and then what happened if it takes 
place,

1776
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:36,850
didn't December first.

1777
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,830
It hasn't happened yet.
The rematch hasn't happened yet,

1778
01:18:38,831 --> 01:18:41,500
but he's lost more than a hundred and 60
pounds.

1779
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,053
He's,
he's slim and he looks fantastic and 

1780
01:18:44,831 --> 01:18:48,610
healthy and he was really fat and really
large and very,

1781
01:18:48,611 --> 01:18:49,444
very depressed.
And now he's really happy and no 

1782
01:18:52,151 --> 01:18:52,984
medication.
And that's the craziest thing about it 

1783
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:57,880
is we're always searching for some pill 
that's going to fix,

1784
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,510
fix whatever weird,
funky path the mind is on.

1785
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:04,600
But for him,
what he found was that goal setting,

1786
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:05,763
like having something that you're 
striving towards working towards this 

1787
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,080
danger is though what happens 
afterwards.

1788
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:13,060
It's exactly the danger because that's 
what he said.

1789
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:14,140
I asked him,
I said,

1790
01:19:14,141 --> 01:19:15,190
well,
what if you win?

1791
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:16,403
What if you win the title?
What if you fight deontay wilder and 

1792
01:19:18,341 --> 01:19:21,200
December first and you beat him and he 
become the championship?

1793
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,160
Uh,
maybe I'll balloon back up to 400 pounds

1794
01:19:24,161 --> 01:19:28,330
again and get depressed and I don't say 
that because I'm worried that he's being

1795
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:30,970
honest because he has been down that 
road before.

1796
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:32,163
But it's fascinating that he achieved 
real happiness from attempting to work 

1797
01:19:39,581 --> 01:19:40,414
towards these goals and building towards
these goals and having this vision in 

1798
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:47,340
his mind.
I think a real thing happening.

1799
01:19:47,341 --> 01:19:47,420
And

1800
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:48,253
with Christianity that kind of exploded 
a relatively new idea onto the seat and 

1801
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:54,030
a couple of thousand years ago,
which to bear in mind.

1802
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,990
So prior to Christianity you kind of had
the stoics,

1803
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:58,620
like for 500 years they were the,
you know,

1804
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:03,630
the hugely popular philosophical school 
and they're all about bear in mind,

1805
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:06,360
they're also the first election from the
east.

1806
01:20:06,361 --> 01:20:07,194
So there's a kind of ideas around like 
non attachment and mindfulness that was 

1807
01:20:10,621 --> 01:20:14,100
sort of differently expressed in a much 
more western rational way.

1808
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:14,934
But they kind of reflect some of those 
ideas that were going on in Buddhism at 

1809
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:18,414
the time.
So the idea of happiness was very much 

1810
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:22,014
about your relationship to the current 
moment and your emotional state in the 

1811
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:26,763
in the moment,
and then also stepping back from her 

1812
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:29,694
whole life and it said you couldn't 
really judge anyone is happy until 

1813
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:33,750
they're on their deathbed.
And then what is,

1814
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:34,613
what is the story that emerged and what 
happened with Christianity is for the 

1815
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:44,391
first time there was this,
this new message that no,

1816
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:45,563
no,
you suffer now and your reward will 

1817
01:20:48,101 --> 01:20:49,090
happen in the future.

1818
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,280
And it's like,
it's an amazing idea,

1819
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:54,990
particularly if you're suffering.
And that was,

1820
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:57,930
you know,
a time when there was hellenic walls and

1821
01:20:57,931 --> 01:20:59,280
you know,
it was a time of great suffering.

1822
01:20:59,281 --> 01:21:00,114
So an amazingly powerful message.
But like that idea of you can take that 

1823
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:06,893
sort of spiritual ladder,
that idea of sort of climbing towards 

1824
01:21:10,351 --> 01:21:11,184
your,
sort of this shimmering golden haze of 

1825
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:15,270
a,
of a reward heaven,

1826
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:18,450
whatever it is off in the distance 
that's now the corporate ladder.

1827
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,620
Right?
That idea that,

1828
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:21,630
that mode has,
has stayed with us.

1829
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,890
We now,
like in England,

1830
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:23,724
I,
I'm not familiar enough with the school 

1831
01:21:25,031 --> 01:21:27,540
structure here,
but in England when you're 16,

1832
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:30,060
you're choosing your a levels,
right?

1833
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:30,894
Which is what you finished school with 
to then decide what you're going to 

1834
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,493
major in at university in order to then 
what job you're going to get at the end 

1835
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:38,963
of that to what promotion you could get 
and what you're going to work your way 

1836
01:21:41,101 --> 01:21:41,670
up to.
I'm like,

1837
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:44,840
what is that moment?
What is that point that it's that,

1838
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:45,391
that end.
You know,

1839
01:21:45,391 --> 01:21:47,430
we're so we are so fixated

1840
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,010
on what's coming and I know this is in a
way it's sort of like,

1841
01:21:52,011 --> 01:21:52,844
well,
this is familiar in terms of the 

1842
01:21:53,631 --> 01:21:54,464
importance of mindfulness and so on,
but it also ties in with like a fear of 

1843
01:21:56,781 --> 01:21:58,400
death,
death.

1844
01:21:58,401 --> 01:21:59,450
Death is.
It's interesting.

1845
01:21:59,451 --> 01:22:00,284
Unpacking why deaths frightening because
we're not going to be there when it 

1846
01:22:02,031 --> 01:22:04,910
happens and all those things,
but it seems to be that it's frightening

1847
01:22:04,911 --> 01:22:08,280
because our projects will end.
You know,

1848
01:22:08,281 --> 01:22:08,900
the,
the,

1849
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,170
whether it's your kids or grandkids that
you won't see grow up or what.

1850
01:22:12,171 --> 01:22:13,004
There's always something that's going to
come to an end and the the antidote to 

1851
01:22:16,611 --> 01:22:21,010
that seems to be just just reappraising 
that constant fixation on the end.

1852
01:22:21,011 --> 01:22:22,550
So I'm on the,
on the future,

1853
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,960
so that's why I'm,
you know,

1854
01:22:23,961 --> 01:22:24,794
I,
I,

1855
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,990
I hear that and god,
how,

1856
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:26,960
I mean,
how amazing he is.

1857
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:28,123
Found that now,
but I can't help but think and then one 

1858
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,100
and then what,
you know,

1859
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:37,750
I couldn't agree more about this idea of
working towards something when you're in

1860
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:39,140
school that you're,
you're,

1861
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,013
you're,
you're almost trying to reach an end 

1862
01:22:41,771 --> 01:22:43,450
that never comes.
I mean you're,

1863
01:22:43,451 --> 01:22:44,284
you're,
you're building for something and also 

1864
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:50,080
the pressure that they put on children 
to start that off at age 14,

1865
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:51,430
15,
16,

1866
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,670
and to pick what you're going to be 
doing for the rest of your life and this

1867
01:22:54,671 --> 01:22:57,520
idea that one day you're going to air 
quotes,

1868
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,890
make it and then you're going to make it
and.

1869
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:03,290
But if you did,
you'd be like inferior in that situation

1870
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:04,124
now or that.
This friend of mine I said built up the 

1871
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:06,334
company and then sold it.
It was depressed and had to go into 

1872
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:11,200
depression at that that need the thing 
that has been driving it,

1873
01:23:11,201 --> 01:23:12,034
that's still there and that needs 
someone to go and it's like you're much 

1874
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:17,630
better off having something unfulfilled 
that at least is taken care of that need

1875
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:18,473
so you need.
He needs something that's going to be 

1876
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,270
perpetually a,
you know,

1877
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:24,200
rewarding,
but patch stimulating,

1878
01:23:24,201 --> 01:23:25,034
stimulating the human mind needs to 
engage in puzzles and and projects and 

1879
01:23:30,921 --> 01:23:31,754
creative endeavors and all sorts of 
different requirements that the mind 

1880
01:23:34,941 --> 01:23:35,774
has.
I believe that mirror requirements that 

1881
01:23:37,641 --> 01:23:40,250
the body has.
We think of the body having requirements

1882
01:23:40,251 --> 01:23:43,040
like you need some daily exercise.
You need good food.

1883
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:48,230
I think you need some mental exercise 
and I think you need knowledge.

1884
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,510
You need information,
you need wisdom.

1885
01:23:50,511 --> 01:23:51,344
You need that to to.
You need inspiration and inspiration 

1886
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:55,424
like when we're talking about all the 
different things that you can do to 

1887
01:23:58,161 --> 01:23:58,994
someone as a hypnotist or that you can 
do to someone when you're putting 

1888
01:24:02,841 --> 01:24:03,674
together these shows and changing their 
perspective on things through these 

1889
01:24:06,381 --> 01:24:09,510
transformative events.
That's,

1890
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:10,763
in a lot of ways,
it's a type of fuel for the mind and 

1891
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:16,400
inspiration is a type of fuel for the 
amount,

1892
01:24:16,401 --> 01:24:18,890
a great book.
It's fuel for the mind,

1893
01:24:18,891 --> 01:24:19,740
you know,
um,

1894
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:24,620
even sometimes people mean this fast 
food culture that we live and we like it

1895
01:24:24,621 --> 01:24:28,460
in a little tiny meme,
a little inspirational meme on someone's

1896
01:24:28,461 --> 01:24:30,000
instagram page says,
oh,

1897
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,250
I like that.
That's what I like,

1898
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:34,510
that it makes me feel good.
It gives you a little bit of a,

1899
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,100
uh,
some nutrition for your mind,

1900
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:42,560
but at the same time is,
it's squaring that with how

1901
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,053
that life is,
it's actually really ambiguous and 

1902
01:24:48,221 --> 01:24:51,340
complex and that's,
that to me is the,

1903
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,653
that's the big thing to become,
I think more conscious of what you'd 

1904
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,820
love.
It's probably the best we can really aim

1905
01:24:57,821 --> 01:24:58,654
for us to become more conscious of,
of the things that beset us because the 

1906
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,620
stop around conscious of is the stuff 
that owns us.

1907
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:06,523
Yes.
And the stuff that we're unwilling to 

1908
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:08,824
acknowledge.
Yeah.

1909
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:13,860
That's the stuff that comes back and 
bites us in the background constantly.

1910
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,430
Yes,
absolutely.

1911
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:20,510
The model of I'm psycho psycho analysis.
I love it as he talks about the god,

1912
01:25:21,921 --> 01:25:23,440
so he was very interesting talking about
like the,

1913
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,240
the,
the,

1914
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,760
the Greek model of the gods because they
didn't necessarily like worship the gods

1915
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:31,930
and believed that they were like real 
definitive in the way that we might talk

1916
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:32,980
about God now,
but they,

1917
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,440
what they were doing was honoring these 
different,

1918
01:25:35,441 --> 01:25:38,710
sort of like clusters of energy,
like,

1919
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,980
like the god of Eros,
like,

1920
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:43,720
so that's you,
you honor Eros because it's important to

1921
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:45,970
honor the sort of,
the erotic urge.

1922
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:48,730
And if you don't,
if you don't honor that,

1923
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:50,220
it's going to come back and get you.
So the,

1924
01:25:50,221 --> 01:25:51,054
the homophobic televangelists that gets 
caught in bed with some guy and at some 

1925
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:56,800
massive scandal,
it will come back and bite you.

1926
01:25:56,801 --> 01:25:58,300
If you just want to bury something in 
you,

1927
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,400
it will come back and bite you.
And I liked that,

1928
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:00,850
but it,
it,

1929
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:01,683
it,
it,

1930
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:02,860
it just means that it,
you know,

1931
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:03,703
life is,
I'm ambivalent and complex and I think 

1932
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:07,634
the best we can do is,
is try and be conscious of that and not 

1933
01:26:12,861 --> 01:26:16,700
be constantly reducing things to uh,
so easy packages.

1934
01:26:16,701 --> 01:26:17,534
But at the same time,
how else do you navigate forward 

1935
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:19,814
without,
without reducing things to an easy 

1936
01:26:20,811 --> 01:26:21,644
story,
that's the only way you can make sense 

1937
01:26:22,701 --> 01:26:24,980
and move forward is to,
is to have an easy story.

1938
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:25,814
So it's,
it's a,

1939
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:29,160
that's like a whole lifetimes,
you know,

1940
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,770
preoccupation there.

1941
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:33,080
Yeah,
it is all messy.

1942
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,333
Yeah.
We do love to similar things down to a 

1943
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,790
nice tasty little easily digestible 
package,

1944
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,920
but the reality is when you open that 
package there,

1945
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:45,093
every package is intensely complex.
Like every single situation has all 

1946
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:52,400
these different interacting factors that
led to that situation taking place.

1947
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:55,670
And if you take them all into 
consideration and really dwell on it,

1948
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:58,640
like you just get paralysis by analysis.
Exactly.

1949
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:02,960
Yeah,
yeah,

1950
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:04,010
exactly,
exactly.

1951
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,413
But a consciousness is awareness is 
probably the most weekend we could aim 

1952
01:27:09,371 --> 01:27:10,400
for,
at least in our own lives.

1953
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:10,911
God,
you can only.

1954
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:12,470
You can only sort your own life out 
here.

1955
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:17,540
It probably also plays into hypnotic 
suggestibility in my own work,

1956
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:19,220
in terms of suggestibility,
because we are,

1957
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:20,323
we're looking for direction,
which is essentially that the simple 

1958
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:27,251
message that easy message was.
So we just kind of kind of wired to grab

1959
01:27:27,381 --> 01:27:29,150
hold of that and absorb it.

1960
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,433
Just kind of want to hit me.
It's like a director of somebody giving 

1961
01:27:31,971 --> 01:27:32,804
you something you know you can hang onto
when you're just kind of confused as 

1962
01:27:36,261 --> 01:27:37,094
sort of essentially I guess what,
what suggestibility is your essentially 

1963
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:44,270
confused and looking for an answer and 
at that moment someone is giving you the

1964
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:46,700
answer in the right way.
But correct me if I'm wrong,

1965
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:50,870
there's no clear scientific 
understanding of what hypnosis is.

1966
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:51,973
It's not like there's like you can 
clearly show like this is what's 

1967
01:27:55,341 --> 01:27:57,920
happening and that's how it works and 
this is why it works.

1968
01:27:57,921 --> 01:27:58,754
There is.
I don't think there's an easy answer to 

1969
01:28:00,261 --> 01:28:01,580
that,
but there is like a said,

1970
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:02,414
forget the hypnotist and the performers.
There is a hole that big body of 

1971
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:07,213
clinical work investigating it because 
it's clearly a thing yet suggestibility 

1972
01:28:11,361 --> 01:28:13,850
is part of the human experience,
but as to what it is.

1973
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,790
Well that's kind of.
That is kind of the question because you

1974
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:19,100
can't ever quite climb inside a person's
head and.

1975
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:22,790
No,
but I like I,

1976
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:23,624
in one of the shows I did,
I did a show where it took you Sirhan 

1977
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:31,930
Sirhan who assassinated Bobby Kennedy.
So he said he was hypnotized by the CIA.

1978
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,930
So it was like that.
That's his story right now as a whole.

1979
01:28:35,931 --> 01:28:37,550
He sets out how,
uh,

1980
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:40,160
how that happened.
So we took that said,

1981
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:40,760
well,
let's,

1982
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,593
let's do it.
Let's set up a and assassinations 

1983
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,890
whether or not is it plausible,
I mean,

1984
01:28:45,891 --> 01:28:47,800
is if you take some of the tiniest 
possible,

1985
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:48,763
do you believe that we did it?
We got a guy and the show starts with a 

1986
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:54,420
big audience of people that are up for 
taking part.

1987
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:56,300
I find the most suggestible person in 
the audience.

1988
01:28:56,990 --> 01:29:00,980
And by the end of it he finds himself in
a packed theater.

1989
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,360
Uh,
no it doesn't.

1990
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:04,021
No,
it's being filmed.

1991
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:07,920
He's got what he thinks is a real gun,
which he thinks is a thing that is going

1992
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:10,050
to carry with them in a bit of filming 
is going to do later.

1993
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:10,884
But he has a real gun on him and we set 
off these little triggers in the same 

1994
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,090
way.
So has a hand said happened to him,

1995
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:15,924
right?
So there's a girl with a Polka dot 

1996
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:17,640
dress.
Uh,

1997
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:18,503
there's a sound that he hears,
which we had a someone's ringtone next 

1998
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:20,934
to him.
The little triggers that they had 

1999
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:25,700
apparently implanted.
What would you do?

2000
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:27,210
Would that guy.
He has no idea.

2001
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:30,000
This is being filmed as know as part of 
the show isn't a packed theater.

2002
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,130
We've got Stephen Fry on stage,
right?

2003
01:29:32,131 --> 01:29:32,964
His,
he's the guy that's going to get 

2004
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,460
assassinated.
So he's on it.

2005
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,670
He's wearing scrubs and everything.

2006
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:38,670
He knows that he may get assassinated at
some point during the show.

2007
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,150
Will the guy do it?
And he does it right.

2008
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:43,620
He stands up and does it.
He fires.

2009
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:46,840
What is a real gun?
A weird,

2010
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:49,350
weird thing of expecting pandemonium 
from the audience.

2011
01:29:49,351 --> 01:29:51,560
And there's that weird normalcy bias 
that kicks him enough.

2012
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,330
I just sat there thinking,
is this part of the show?

2013
01:29:54,331 --> 01:29:56,610
We had all these crowd control people 
and like nothing happened,

2014
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:58,140
but he did it like,
you know,

2015
01:29:58,141 --> 01:29:59,670
he uh,
he shoots it.

2016
01:29:59,671 --> 01:30:00,504
But that was good as I mentioned that 
because at the beginning of it we're 

2017
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:04,260
doing these tests with a guy,
um,

2018
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,213
and you know,
the people in the room and sort of 

2019
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:09,180
looking at what is,
what is going on with it Moses.

2020
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,193
So we had this,
we had an ice bath and I hypnotize him 

2021
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:15,744
and told him under hypnosis he'd be able
to come to begin the ice bath and you 

2022
01:30:17,611 --> 01:30:19,920
wouldn't feel the,
the temperature.

2023
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,430
And I had no idea if you would,
because that's a real test.

2024
01:30:23,431 --> 01:30:25,770
Like if he's just sort of playing along 
at some level,

2025
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,833
you're not gonna,
you're not gonna get an ice bath like 

2026
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:30,294
that.
Even if it's even if there's some kind 

2027
01:30:32,611 --> 01:30:33,444
of physiological state you can tap into 
to make that possible that some people 

2028
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:40,290
with training can do as a first time 
just step in and do it.

2029
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:41,850
He's gonna he's not gonna be able to do 
that.

2030
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,710
And I had these two clinical hypnotist 
with me.

2031
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:46,740
They hate actually might made a bet on 
whether or not you do it.

2032
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,180
They thought he wouldn't do it.
I had no idea.

2033
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,790
And he did do it.
And it really kind of,

2034
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:52,943
sort of three me,
he was comfortable being in this ice 

2035
01:30:54,961 --> 01:30:55,794
bath and see the temperature.
We had him kind of linked up to a 

2036
01:30:58,800 --> 01:30:59,970
thermograph thing.

2037
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,700
We had to pull him out if he was at a 
certain temperature.

2038
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,530
I think if it got to whatever it was,
50,

2039
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:06,300
whatever that means we had to,
we had to take him out.

2040
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:08,600
Um,
you know,

2041
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,950
and that was,
that was extraordinary.

2042
01:31:10,951 --> 01:31:13,830
So although I think of it in very 
behavioral terms,

2043
01:31:13,831 --> 01:31:15,390
I don't think of it as any kind of 
special.

2044
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,400
We had state.
Then it's like,

2045
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:18,090
well then you know,
what was,

2046
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:21,410
what was going on with that guy?
Well it's,

2047
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,393
it's a physiological possibility that we
can do that because somebody can do it 

2048
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:25,674
through lots of training.
So maybe it just kind of with this guy 

2049
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:30,060
cut to the chase and he was able to just
do it.

2050
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,640
But I don't know what the next guy do 
it.

2051
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:33,721
Probably not.
I don't know.

2052
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,830
What about the,
the ethical

2053
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,960
complications that are involved in 
having a guy literally performed murder?

2054
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:43,913
I mean,
he doesn't,

2055
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:46,020
he's not actually do because it's an 
actor.

2056
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,140
He doesn't,
he doesn't know that he's not performing

2057
01:31:49,141 --> 01:31:49,974
murder.
He thinks he's a murderer and then you 

2058
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:56,260
put it on television.
Yeah.

2059
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,900
You have a murderer.
Yeah,

2060
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,980
he's a murderer.
I mean there's a,

2061
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,840
there's a good kid that's a show where 
he is being like completely conditioned,

2062
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,130
but that's terrifying

2063
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,273
that a,
this is possible and they'd be to this 

2064
01:32:09,081 --> 01:32:11,330
person that has never experienced 
anything like that before.

2065
01:32:11,331 --> 01:32:12,164
Finds out that it's possible for him and
that he actually squeezes the trigger 

2066
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,110
and watch a Stephen Fry fall to the 
ground.

2067
01:32:18,111 --> 01:32:20,390
The squibs go off and he thinks he's a 
murder.

2068
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:21,403
And look,
if you follow the logic that the FBI is 

2069
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:25,844
used because the FBI has used similar 
logic to talk some pretty mentally 

2070
01:32:30,771 --> 01:32:31,604
challenged people into detonating fake 
bumps that were purchased from the FBI 

2071
01:32:36,231 --> 01:32:37,064
and those people are in jail for life.
And this is a thing that happened in 

2072
01:32:39,981 --> 01:32:40,814
Dallas.
There was a young man who was very 

2073
01:32:43,131 --> 01:32:43,964
suggestible and uh,
he had some serious psychological 

2074
01:32:47,241 --> 01:32:48,074
problems probably.
And he was a radical and he wanted to 

2075
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:52,423
become some sort of a terrorist,
whether it was al Qaeda or isis or 

2076
01:32:55,641 --> 01:32:56,474
whatever.
And the FBI infiltrated this guy his 

2077
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,733
life and set him up and got him,
or whatever organization was with the 

2078
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:06,203
CIA or FBI,
they or they organize some sort of an 

2079
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,760
artificial bomb.
They got this bump to him,

2080
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:14,893
had him set up the bomb,
and then gave him this ability to 

2081
01:33:18,621 --> 01:33:19,454
detonate it.
He goes to detonate it and then they 

2082
01:33:21,381 --> 01:33:23,330
arrest him.
So there was no bomb.

2083
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,510
The bomb didn't exist.
They talked him into doing it

2084
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:28,350
and they genuinely invested in many 
genuinely good,

2085
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:31,990
genuine jail for live.
They talked him into doing it.

2086
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:36,340
They provided him with the bond.
The bumper didn't exist.

2087
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:40,300
It wasn't a real bomb.
It wasn't going to kill anybody and they

2088
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,310
took this person and essentially did a 
version of what you did.

2089
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:46,720
But it wasn't funny.

2090
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:50,490
It was.
It wasn't for a television show,

2091
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:54,630
but through the same intent,
through this guys are different intent.

2092
01:33:54,631 --> 01:33:55,750
Hopefully.
Well he might.

2093
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:58,320
For him,
the intent was to kill

2094
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:03,370
and the intent to kill Stephen Fry or 
the intent to kill innocent people.

2095
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:05,740
He was going to get with his bomb.
Essentially.

2096
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:07,263
There were both talked into doing this.
No real evidence that this guy would 

2097
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:12,940
have ever done it without the FBI or CIA
or whoever the fuck else it was.

2098
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:14,460
Yeah,
but if,

2099
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,293
if,
if that had ended with them stepping in 

2100
01:34:16,281 --> 01:34:17,420
and going,
okay,

2101
01:34:17,421 --> 01:34:19,280
we're going to stop you here.
This was an experiment.

2102
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:20,990
Yes,
you've been conditioned to do this.

2103
01:34:20,991 --> 01:34:21,824
We wanted to see if you would.
You have done it and now he is a very 

2104
01:34:23,961 --> 01:34:26,150
careful and delicate dad thing to make 
sure you're okay.

2105
01:34:26,151 --> 01:34:26,984
That would be a different story and 
somehow the ends would then it would be 

2106
01:34:29,241 --> 01:34:33,860
like a maybe even a fascinating and 
valuable thing to do if,

2107
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:37,640
if the guy was fine at the end of it and
happy with it and it wasn't in jail,

2108
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:39,203
well that's kind of more of the world 
that we're in here and I'm not making a 

2109
01:34:42,771 --> 01:34:45,530
judgment on what you're doing.
I think what you're doing is awesome,

2110
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:46,960
but I mean,
I think it's fair.

2111
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:51,990
I think what they did is kind of fucked 
up and not just fucked up but crazy that

2112
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:55,220
this is a waste of resources.
I mean,

2113
01:34:55,221 --> 01:34:57,980
maybe I'm incorrect.
Maybe this person on that path.

2114
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,813
Anyway,
and they recognized it and they stepped 

2115
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:00,531
in,
they said,

2116
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:01,364
listen,
this guy is going to do something and 

2117
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:05,750
we're going to help him because we need 
to get this guy off the streets,

2118
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:09,830
so let's show that he's capable of 
detonating a bomb and killing a bunch of

2119
01:35:09,831 --> 01:35:12,500
civilians and will provide him with 
whatever he needs.

2120
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:14,450
Then we'll get them.
Maybe they did it that way.

2121
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:15,680
I don't know.
I don't really.

2122
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:16,514
You know,
obviously I wasn't there when all this 

2123
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:20,720
was going down,
but it seems eerily parallel.

2124
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:23,203
Yeah.
Well,

2125
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,520
yeah.
My,

2126
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:25,483
my,
my concern is I guess what makes 

2127
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:29,600
hopefully what makes this shows 
compelling,

2128
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,473
these sorts of questions,
the sort of implications beyond a 

2129
01:35:33,351 --> 01:35:35,690
controlled thing with one guy who is 
fine.

2130
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,823
Also it opens the door to the 
possibility that this has been done in 

2131
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:42,290
the past was Manchurian candidate 
possibility.

2132
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:43,671
Yeah.
Well,

2133
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:44,504
yeah,
I perspective you must think it's 

2134
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:48,590
possible.
Right?

2135
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:51,520
Well,
I often making that show I sort of felt,

2136
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,120
well,
that work,

2137
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,810
it doesn't mean that his story is true.
Of course.

2138
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:58,510
It doesn't really necessarily have to 
relate to that at all,

2139
01:35:58,511 --> 01:35:59,344
but.

2140
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,240
But you did.
It was kind of,

2141
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,430
it kind of works.
It worked,

2142
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,423
yeah.
Why did you write a book about 

2143
01:36:08,111 --> 01:36:08,944
happiness?
I wrote a book about happiness because 

2144
01:36:10,601 --> 01:36:11,140
the,

2145
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:13,210
that makes it really resonated with me.
I was,

2146
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:14,710
I like,
I,

2147
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:17,650
I studied law.
I was supposed to be a lawyer and I uh,

2148
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:21,520
graduated and I kind of was living in 
Bristol,

2149
01:36:21,521 --> 01:36:22,354
this lovely city in England and I'm 
making my living as a magician because 

2150
01:36:24,851 --> 01:36:25,684
that wasn't the hobby that I had started
and I was just kind of thinking what I 

2151
01:36:29,171 --> 01:36:32,320
need to some point with this grow into a
job.

2152
01:36:32,321 --> 01:36:33,154
I don't know,
but I know that my priorities are just 

2153
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:37,060
kind of,
I want my life.

2154
01:36:37,061 --> 01:36:40,720
My Dad used to feel like this is good,
everything's in the right place and this

2155
01:36:40,721 --> 01:36:44,130
is kind of an enjoyable and worthwhile 
pastime and,

2156
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:47,500
or worthwhile existence.
And I never really thought beyond that.

2157
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:49,720
So I've never had any kind of ambition,
genuinely have any,

2158
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,190
any salt,
which is why,

2159
01:36:51,191 --> 01:36:52,390
you know,
I haven't really,

2160
01:36:52,391 --> 01:36:54,160
I'm not a whole goal setting thing 
particularly.

2161
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:55,203
So.
But the trouble with thinking like that 

2162
01:36:57,101 --> 01:36:57,934
as you grow up and become successful 
with what you do is you start to feel 

2163
01:37:01,661 --> 01:37:02,494
like a kid,
like everyone else is a grownup and 

2164
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:04,953
you're the kid and,
and slightly embarrassed that you don't 

2165
01:37:07,451 --> 01:37:10,420
seem to care enough about the things 
that everybody else cares about.

2166
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:13,020
The businessy things and the viewing 
figures into this,

2167
01:37:13,021 --> 01:37:13,854
I,
my interest was genuinely am I enjoying 

2168
01:37:15,881 --> 01:37:16,714
what I'm doing and is it worthwhile?
And then I read the stoics and although 

2169
01:37:18,251 --> 01:37:21,130
that's not like the central message,
it's a big part of their,

2170
01:37:21,131 --> 01:37:22,090
what they write about,
you know,

2171
01:37:22,091 --> 01:37:22,924
not,
not trying to control things that are 

2172
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:26,424
out of your control,
not attaching yourself to things that 

2173
01:37:27,941 --> 01:37:31,510
leave you kind of emotionally 
vulnerable.

2174
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,370
Um,
and you know,

2175
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,500
just your relationship with the present 
moment and so on.

2176
01:37:35,501 --> 01:37:37,120
And it really resonated.
So I,

2177
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:39,400
uh,
I read it,

2178
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:43,030
I read a lot and it took me off into 
other directions that I started writing.

2179
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:46,870
And I wrote this book on happiness after
it took me three years to write it while

2180
01:37:46,871 --> 01:37:50,200
I was on tour for three years.
But blocks of blocks of writing,

2181
01:37:50,201 --> 01:37:52,970
not like three solid years.
It also,

2182
01:37:52,971 --> 01:37:56,580
that meant by the end of it I kind of 
had and changed and felt differently and

2183
01:37:56,581 --> 01:37:57,414
I think for anyone that knows about 
stoicism and it's so immensely valuable 

2184
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:05,340
resource in terms of if what you want is
a sense of feeling centered in a kind of

2185
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:08,220
emotional robustness in your life.
And uh,

2186
01:38:08,221 --> 01:38:10,630
you know,
if you suffer from anxiety and so it's,

2187
01:38:10,631 --> 01:38:12,120
it's,
it's phenomenal.

2188
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:13,133
I think there where it,
where it's slightly doesn't deliver is 

2189
01:38:16,381 --> 01:38:18,870
the importance of anxiety.
It's all about avoiding anxiety.

2190
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:21,390
That their image of happiness was a sort
of tranquility.

2191
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:25,260
Avoiding disturbance that actually cause
disturbance is really important.

2192
01:38:25,261 --> 01:38:27,270
Anxiety's important in life because how 
do you change?

2193
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,193
How do you grow other than a.
unless some anxiety triggers that you 

2194
01:38:34,221 --> 01:38:35,850
know,
lets you know that something's wrong.

2195
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,250
If we just look for security all the 
time.

2196
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:39,840
And I say this because I know I'm like 
this,

2197
01:38:39,841 --> 01:38:43,050
like this is my,
my problem is that I'm too.

2198
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:46,740
I'm very good at avoiding stress,
very good at avoiding anxiety.

2199
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:47,640
But the danger is,
I don't know,

2200
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:49,020
am I going to grow or,
you know,

2201
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:51,240
I'm just going to just be too 
comfortable.

2202
01:38:51,241 --> 01:38:51,631
That's not,
you know,

2203
01:38:51,631 --> 01:38:54,000
there's not necessarily a good thing.
Um,

2204
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,351
so,
uh,

2205
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:56,400
so yeah,
by the end of the book I was,

2206
01:38:56,401 --> 01:38:59,700
I kind of could feel the edges of 
stoicism in terms of,

2207
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:04,490
uh,
the importance of anxiety in a,

2208
01:39:04,650 --> 01:39:06,930
not just living to comfortably,
but it is a.

2209
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:07,871
and that's not,
you know,

2210
01:39:07,871 --> 01:39:08,704
they were movers and shakers,
like there are people that changed the 

2211
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:10,560
world.

2212
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,680
Marcus Aurelius,
greatest philosopher,

2213
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:17,730
king,
an emperor most powerful man or ever was

2214
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:19,210
probably ruled the earth and was,
uh,

2215
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:20,910
was,
uh,

2216
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:23,310
one of the great stoics.
So they're not like,

2217
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,173
it's not a recipe for complacency,
which you can often sound like when you 

2218
01:39:26,221 --> 01:39:28,740
talk about this kind of tranquility and 
non attachment.

2219
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:29,903
But,
uh,

2220
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,261
it is,
it's,

2221
01:39:31,261 --> 01:39:31,800
it's,
uh,

2222
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,530
it's just,
it's a very robust kind of language.

2223
01:39:34,531 --> 01:39:38,940
They talk about being like a rock where 
the waves and lashing against you and I,

2224
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:42,450
I prefer the image of sort of don't.
If you know Martha Nussbaum,

2225
01:39:42,451 --> 01:39:45,870
who's an American philosophy,
he writes a lot about these things,

2226
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:48,150
but she,
she talks about being more porous,

2227
01:39:48,151 --> 01:39:51,270
like a rock that the waves,
the water can move through.

2228
01:39:51,271 --> 01:39:53,070
And I think that's a more helpful image.
I think that's a,

2229
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:56,760
that's a good way I think of stepping 
out into life is if you can have a,

2230
01:39:57,470 --> 01:40:00,000
a sort of a robustness,
but at the same time,

2231
01:40:00,001 --> 01:40:03,900
that kind of uneasy porous relationship 
with what's going on that gives you that

2232
01:40:03,901 --> 01:40:04,734
easier relationship to fate and fortune 
and all those things that they used to 

2233
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:13,020
honor and recognize so much more than we
do now because we don't read tragedy.

2234
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:16,170
So we don't think in terms of those 
things.

2235
01:40:16,171 --> 01:40:17,010
It's all just,
you know,

2236
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:20,880
pride and Hubris now that they had 
lessons about back then and uh,

2237
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:21,714
you know,
uh,

2238
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:22,891
uh,
but I think that's a really.

2239
01:40:22,891 --> 01:40:23,790
I think that's a,
that's a good,

2240
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,500
that's a good starting point for life.
So I wrote,

2241
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:26,463
I wrote this book happy it is.
It's actually just become available in 

2242
01:40:28,891 --> 01:40:30,540
the,
in the US on Amazon.

2243
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:32,200
I don't think you find it any bookshops,
but um,

2244
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,353
because of the like I'm to hopefully 
doing a broadway show next year and 

2245
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,400
these netflix specials and things that 
are,

2246
01:40:38,401 --> 01:40:39,110
you know,
so it,

2247
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:40,860
it is now available.
Um,

2248
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,920
and uh,
and ironically,

2249
01:40:43,921 --> 01:40:46,470
the moment I finished writing it,
I was out giving talks on happiness,

2250
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,880
feeling oddly sad and I couldn't work 
out why.

2251
01:40:48,881 --> 01:40:49,714
And it was because this amazing three 
years writing project had ended and I 

2252
01:40:52,201 --> 01:40:52,830
realized,
yeah,

2253
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:53,663
I.
The importance of some kind of creative 

2254
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:59,140
pursuit or something that brings you out
of yourself is so important.

2255
01:40:59,230 --> 01:40:59,960
That's fast.

2256
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:00,793
Meaning that in the embracing of the 
anxiety of the difficulty of the task 

2257
01:41:05,831 --> 01:41:07,010
and finding upon it

2258
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,350
completion,
that you feel sad.

2259
01:41:09,450 --> 01:41:11,570
That oddly a oddly sad.
Well,

2260
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:14,230
it's kind of proof of concept that,
right?

2261
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:15,223
I mean,
with what you're saying is like in this 

2262
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:17,683
theme that you keep saying over and over
again that putting yourself into 

2263
01:41:20,751 --> 01:41:22,250
something bigger than you,
something,

2264
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:27,670
something that you're attempting to work
through and that through this difficulty

2265
01:41:27,741 --> 01:41:29,870
and all the struggle and trying to put 
this something you,

2266
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:30,743
you,
you gained some sort of intangible 

2267
01:41:32,421 --> 01:41:33,254
benefit from them.

2268
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:36,110
You feel like you,
you seem like you're some of the.

2269
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,233
Seeks out those things.
You seem like you've always immersed 

2270
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:43,570
yourself fully and things that would,
that would do that.

2271
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:46,860
Yes.
I'm a firm believer in the importance of

2272
01:41:46,861 --> 01:41:48,870
difficult tasks.
I think,

2273
01:41:48,871 --> 01:41:49,704
uh,
I think seeking comfort is one of the 

2274
01:41:51,451 --> 01:41:55,200
worst things a person can do in terms of
achieving overall happiness.

2275
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:56,423
I think overall happiness,
a lot of it comes through this amazing 

2276
01:41:59,401 --> 01:42:04,401
sense of wonder and the unknown and 
possibilities and working towards things

2277
01:42:07,111 --> 01:42:10,830
with this embracing of having no idea 
how the,

2278
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,753
what the result is going to be.
No idea where this is going to go and 

2279
01:42:14,191 --> 01:42:16,530
being genuinely nervous about it every 
step of the way.

2280
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,880
And do you find that there's normally 
being,

2281
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:19,783
having the language for something means 
that it doesn't come naturally because 

2282
01:42:23,231 --> 01:42:24,064
if it,
if that came entirely naturally are the 

2283
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:26,560
things I'm saying,
if they completely just,

2284
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:27,783
I'd always been like that.
You wouldn't have the language because 

2285
01:42:28,691 --> 01:42:29,524
they'd just be entirely unconscious.
So you found this is stuff that you've 

2286
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:36,110
found and then learn to articulate,
but because it does not,

2287
01:42:36,370 --> 01:42:37,203
it's not an easy thing.
It's not an not an intuitive thing that 

2288
01:42:39,371 --> 01:42:42,430
maybe life is,
is essentially difficult.

2289
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:46,030
And these lovely happy moments we have 
are wonderful,

2290
01:42:46,031 --> 01:42:50,260
but they're not the kind of.
They're not the central force of life,

2291
01:42:50,261 --> 01:42:51,730
which is that it is,
it is difficult.

2292
01:42:51,731 --> 01:42:53,610
I not.
And if you want to philosophy of life,

2293
01:42:53,611 --> 01:42:56,860
it has to work in those has to work at 
the difficult moments,

2294
01:42:56,861 --> 01:42:58,000
isn't it?
Otherwise it's not really.

2295
01:42:58,001 --> 01:42:59,410
It's not really going to support you.

2296
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:00,303
I think it's also the attitude in which 
you embrace those difficult moments and 

2297
01:43:02,891 --> 01:43:04,510
how you approach them.
You know,

2298
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:05,344
if you,
if you relish them and understand that 

2299
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:08,314
there's going to be some genuine benefit
from getting through these and whether 

2300
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:15,580
it's a physical thing or a mental thing,
whether it's a creative thing,

2301
01:43:15,581 --> 01:43:16,900
whatever it is,
as difficult,

2302
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:22,250
like just embrace this massive struggle 
and and enjoy this.

2303
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,340
Just the puzzle of it all,
the,

2304
01:43:25,341 --> 01:43:25,970
the,
the,

2305
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:26,803
the majesty of the unknown,
and then when you get through it on the 

2306
01:43:29,321 --> 01:43:31,930
other end,
you get a different level of happiness.

2307
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,090
He had this powerful earned

2308
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,430
because she's grown and grown and 
you've,

2309
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:38,480
you've moved forward and you don't,
you don't,

2310
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:39,603
you don't cross the road on your own 
without having to let go of your 

2311
01:43:41,881 --> 01:43:44,290
mother's hand at some point something.
Well,

2312
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:46,710
this is,
this is the death and resurrection,

2313
01:43:46,711 --> 01:43:47,544
isn't it?
That's why these myths do have some 

2314
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:50,380
resonance.
Yes,

2315
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:53,750
something has die before something new,
before something you can grow.

2316
01:43:53,751 --> 01:43:54,584
You have to,
something has to be let go of in order 

2317
01:43:56,391 --> 01:43:58,340
to step forward.
So if you're going to grow,

2318
01:43:58,341 --> 01:43:59,174
you have to,
there has to be anxiety and disturbance 

2319
01:44:01,881 --> 01:44:05,750
and some kind of some sort of death in 
the metaphorical sense.

2320
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:06,910
Yeah,
that's tough.

2321
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,510
It doesn't come easily.
No,

2322
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:09,363
it doesn't come easily,
but that's also what's beautiful about 

2323
01:44:11,081 --> 01:44:12,130
it.
If it just came easily,

2324
01:44:12,131 --> 01:44:13,840
I don't think it would be appreciated.
Exactly.

2325
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:15,083
You wouldn't be doing it and there's all
this resistance to even engage in it in 

2326
01:44:17,621 --> 01:44:18,391
the first place.
I mean,

2327
01:44:18,391 --> 01:44:20,350
it's hard to write the first word of a 
book,

2328
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:21,910
right?
The first word.

2329
01:44:21,911 --> 01:44:24,760
Sometimes you just sit in there or 
anything you're trying to do,

2330
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:26,920
get it.
The first step of a 10 mile run.

2331
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:28,840
All those things are the most difficult 
thing.

2332
01:44:28,841 --> 01:44:29,920
Once you're.
Once you're going,

2333
01:44:29,921 --> 01:44:32,350
it's not nearly as hard.
It's getting going.

2334
01:44:32,351 --> 01:44:33,184
There's something about overcoming all 
this anticipation and all the weirdness 

2335
01:44:37,661 --> 01:44:38,770
of it all,
you know,

2336
01:44:38,771 --> 01:44:41,770
and then once you do it and you realize 
you can do it,

2337
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:44,470
it enriches you in all your future 
attempts.

2338
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:45,723
So something like you deciding to run a 
marathon would help you decide to write 

2339
01:44:49,661 --> 01:44:50,494
a book.
Like all these different things are 

2340
01:44:51,641 --> 01:44:53,620
interconnected.
The poet,

2341
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:56,230
a real random area,
real cut talks about him

2342
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,120
was loved this image of like some people
live in a big room,

2343
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,553
some people live in a small room and 
some people just like just pace up and 

2344
01:45:02,331 --> 01:45:04,490
down by the window.
Kind of write that.

2345
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:05,833
Although I do a lot with my life,
but I think instinctively I'm the guy 

2346
01:45:08,031 --> 01:45:09,920
that's just sort of pacing up and down 
by the window.

2347
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:15,450
I'm instinctively how so in that I'm,
I'm a little shy and I kind of.

2348
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:18,710
I'm very good at avoiding.
I just think you're smart.

2349
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,500
To avoid

2350
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:23,860
no shy is a lot of it is like,
look,

2351
01:45:23,861 --> 01:45:24,694
the interaction between human beings is 
so who knows what the fuck's going to 

2352
01:45:28,061 --> 01:45:28,900
happen?
You know what I mean?

2353
01:45:28,901 --> 01:45:29,341
You,
you,

2354
01:45:29,341 --> 01:45:31,120
you don't know how people are going to 
perceive you.

2355
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:31,954
There's potential bad feelings that 
could come with that is there's all 

2356
01:45:35,441 --> 01:45:36,274
sorts of weird social anxiety and social
cues that you have to read and the 

2357
01:45:38,921 --> 01:45:40,840
complications of those.
Make sure you get it right.

2358
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:43,000
Don't want to get it wrong.
Don't want to be too rude,

2359
01:45:43,001 --> 01:45:45,090
don't want to be too forward.
Don't want to be too shy.

2360
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:49,720
Ramped up.
It's A.

2361
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,970
I think it's the case with everybody.
I mean the,

2362
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:52,804
the,
the reason for shyness is there's a 

2363
01:45:54,701 --> 01:45:57,140
terrible feeling when you're rejected,
you know,

2364
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:00,690
the meeting,
someone who doesn't enjoy the way you've

2365
01:46:00,691 --> 01:46:01,524
presented yourself as an awful feeling 
that will haunt you for hours if not 

2366
01:46:04,871 --> 01:46:05,704
days.
Three in the morning I've had 

2367
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:08,373
interactions with people and then two 
weeks later I'll be putting gas in my 

2368
01:46:11,411 --> 01:46:12,244
car.
Just go,

2369
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,190
what did I say?
Why did I say it like that?

2370
01:46:15,191 --> 01:46:15,880
Like,
who knows?

2371
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:16,713
Like that's all of that is there's a 
reason why people have some sort of a 

2372
01:46:21,881 --> 01:46:23,560
weird anxiety about interactions.

2373
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:24,653
Also the stuff that,
which is why that the difficulty is so 

2374
01:46:27,591 --> 01:46:31,220
worth embracing because if you can,
if you can,

2375
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:32,563
if you can embrace it,
that's where there is a kind of oddly 

2376
01:46:36,231 --> 01:46:38,930
sublime space because that,
you know,

2377
01:46:38,931 --> 01:46:39,764
that's the real stuff of life and that's
the stuff that actually binds everyone 

2378
01:46:42,141 --> 01:46:44,360
together and that the,
the,

2379
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,630
the happy moments.
Well,

2380
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,500
they might just be happy because you 
know,

2381
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:52,030
she's great and wonderful,
but you might just,

2382
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:54,030
you just haven't got all,
got all the information at that point,

2383
01:46:54,031 --> 01:46:55,440
right.
That's kind of what's going on.

2384
01:46:55,441 --> 01:46:57,410
So those,
when we,

2385
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,060
when we,
when we're embroiled in the difficulty,

2386
01:47:00,061 --> 01:47:00,894
I think that's when we're most human and
it doesn't necessarily make it any 

2387
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:05,850
easier by its nature,
but there is a real value to that.

2388
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:06,684
There's a level of growth and a kind of 
sort of just a voice somewhere in the 

2389
01:47:13,231 --> 01:47:17,360
background that these,
or just as a note of this,

2390
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,710
this is,
this is what binds everyone together.

2391
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:21,600
And I think the,
as you said,

2392
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:25,110
yeah,
it's a better type of happiness,

2393
01:47:25,111 --> 01:47:26,370
but it doesn't,
it doesn't come easy.

2394
01:47:26,371 --> 01:47:30,090
But I think life is about growing up is 
about tolerating ambiguity,

2395
01:47:30,091 --> 01:47:33,960
isn't it more than more than anything.
When we're infants we scream and someone

2396
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:36,900
comes in and gives us the thing that 
makes us feel good.

2397
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:38,063
And uh,
there was a British and a child 

2398
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,120
psychologist called a Donald Winnicott,
who's sort of,

2399
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,640
kind of appeared after Freud and that 
there's a lot of,

2400
01:47:47,641 --> 01:47:48,474
there was a lot of people felt so guilty
and terrible after Freud was damaging 

2401
01:47:52,621 --> 01:47:54,360
the kids and he had this great message 
of light.

2402
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:55,194
You've actually what the mother or the 
principal caregiver needs to be as good 

2403
01:47:58,951 --> 01:47:59,784
enough.
What she actually needs to do is to 

2404
01:48:00,541 --> 01:48:03,300
gently let down her infant,
right?

2405
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:05,700
Because if you,
uh,

2406
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:06,563
if you,
if you just grow up thinking that every 

2407
01:48:09,511 --> 01:48:10,344
time you screamed,
someone's going to give you what you 

2408
01:48:11,011 --> 01:48:11,250
want.

2409
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:13,950
If you make enough fuss,
you just get what you want.

2410
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:19,370
That's not a very healthy way of growing
up into adult life or becoming a leader.

2411
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:22,500
Um,
so instead what the,

2412
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:25,260
what your mother caregiver needs to do 
is to,

2413
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:27,960
is to let you down,
is that needs to disillusion.

2414
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:30,450
You need to learn.
Sometimes I scream and I won't get those

2415
01:48:30,451 --> 01:48:31,560
things and that,
that's okay.

2416
01:48:31,561 --> 01:48:32,730
And you know,
um,

2417
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:35,010
so likewise,
you know,

2418
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,293
in life,
like living with disillusionment is 

2419
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:39,780
like,
that's,

2420
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:41,670
that's,
that's fine.

2421
01:48:41,671 --> 01:48:43,230
That's how it is.
And if we don't have that,

2422
01:48:43,231 --> 01:48:47,220
if we live out this sort of fantasy that
we owed,

2423
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:50,010
we're owed something should,
why load,

2424
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:50,903
right?
That the secret that I did at 

2425
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:56,390
universities arranging itself around our
banal hocking wishes or,

2426
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:59,400
and it's always like actresses and 
obviously,

2427
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,520
and the fact that she sort of says,
oh,

2428
01:49:02,521 --> 01:49:04,540
this all goes back to Plato.
The,

2429
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:06,653
they couldn't have been any any further 
from the idea of a wandering all these 

2430
01:49:11,911 --> 01:49:13,130
kinds of material gains.

2431
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:17,750
So it's fascinating how this subject 
repeats itself in some sort of a strange

2432
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:18,613
intermittent cycle where people start 
talking about manifesting things with 

2433
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:25,580
your mind and put it in La.
I don't know if that's a thing.

2434
01:49:25,610 --> 01:49:26,780
Well,
it's recently,

2435
01:49:26,781 --> 01:49:29,890
it seems to be working its way back 
around again where it was.

2436
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:34,400
It was outside of the conversation for 
quite a long time.

2437
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:35,234
But now it seems to be coming back again
where people are always looking for 

2438
01:49:37,521 --> 01:49:40,280
reasons why certain people are 
successful.

2439
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:42,920
And that's a big one.
The big one is this,

2440
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:47,470
this idea that people can manifest 
things with their mind and you know,

2441
01:49:47,471 --> 01:49:48,304
when it comes from,
again discussing this with people who 

2442
01:49:50,701 --> 01:49:51,534
have become successful and they're 
looking for a reason as to why they're 

2443
01:49:54,641 --> 01:49:55,420
successful

2444
01:49:55,420 --> 01:50:00,420
and it's very hard to accredit luck 
would show it's in their success.

2445
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:04,370
Yeah,
well it's an element analysis,

2446
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,880
the whole story,
but the secret thing

2447
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:08,303
and element,
the power of positive thinking is an 

2448
01:50:11,281 --> 01:50:13,650
element.
All these things are elements,

2449
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:16,410
but they're all combined with 
circumstance,

2450
01:50:16,411 --> 01:50:17,670
luck,
genetics,

2451
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:22,320
cultural interactions,
the way human beings,

2452
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,530
they're just the time of the year you 
were born.

2453
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,170
You know what I mean?
There's so many different factors.

2454
01:50:28,171 --> 01:50:30,280
There's so many things that can lead to.
I mean,

2455
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,890
and also where you're born.
I mean you do where,

2456
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:33,813
where are you living?
I mean all these things have a huge 

2457
01:50:36,091 --> 01:50:39,900
factor in your success.
Try being a entrepreneur in Ethiopia.

2458
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,150
I mean,
it's a different experience than being,

2459
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:42,840
you know,
a,

2460
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,780
a,
a tech startup guy in San Francisco.

2461
01:50:45,781 --> 01:50:46,614
It's clearly one of them has an 
advantage and there's a lot of those 

2462
01:50:50,431 --> 01:50:52,200
things that play into each other and to 
say,

2463
01:50:52,201 --> 01:50:53,070
well,
you know,

2464
01:50:53,071 --> 01:50:53,904
the guy in Ethiopia,
he just wasn't thinking about it the 

2465
01:50:55,861 --> 01:50:56,694
right way.
He didn't,

2466
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:57,593
he didn't,
he didn't make a wish board and put his 

2467
01:50:59,821 --> 01:51:01,110
pictures of his,
uh,

2468
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:03,640
his house was Ferrari in front of it or 
yeah,

2469
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:05,290
whatever the fuck is trying to.
It's,

2470
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,710
it's an,
it's the infant's urge.

2471
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:08,603
It's screaming into the and the universe
will provide if there's some way that 

2472
01:51:12,571 --> 01:51:13,404
the universe doesn't get,
that should be our starting point of 

2473
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:18,540
living,
but surely the universe doesn't care.

2474
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:21,570
What's the perspective enhancer?
The universe in,

2475
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:23,770
in and of itself is a prospective 
enhancer minutes.

2476
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,850
If you can go somewhere in the country 
where there's no light pollution and see

2477
01:51:26,851 --> 01:51:29,340
the Milky Way,
you get this.

2478
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:30,690
Oh,
okay.

2479
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:33,990
Okay.
This is a lot bigger than I'm thinking.

2480
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,213
It's,
I think it's one of the real problems 

2481
01:51:36,271 --> 01:51:41,271
that we have with our society with 
electrical lights that sort of blind out

2482
01:51:41,491 --> 01:51:42,324
the stars.

2483
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:46,410
We don't get humbled that the book I 
mentioned spell of the sensuous.

2484
01:51:46,411 --> 01:51:47,330
This guy,
David Abrams,

2485
01:51:47,331 --> 01:51:51,510
who was out living in rural East Asia,
he described at the very beginning,

2486
01:51:51,511 --> 01:51:52,344
this amazing image.
He was living in this hot and it was 

2487
01:51:54,601 --> 01:51:56,280
just,
he wakes up in the middle of the night.

2488
01:51:56,281 --> 01:51:57,114
There's any,
just kind of,

2489
01:51:57,270 --> 01:51:58,103
I guess being there for a night or two 
and he's in this patty field which has 

2490
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:05,310
become drenched with water,
with rain.

2491
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:11,420
He steps out and you have this 
incredible star filled clear sky,

2492
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,730
which is reflected.
It's pitch black apart from that,

2493
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:19,170
right,
so a star filled sky.

2494
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:20,153
It's reflected perfect like a,
like a mirror in this drenched enormous 

2495
01:52:23,311 --> 01:52:27,300
battlefield that is this fireflies 
everywhere in between.

2496
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:28,710
Flying around,
right?

2497
01:52:28,711 --> 01:52:32,880
These little little specks of light and 
they had no sense of like what was up,

2498
01:52:32,881 --> 01:52:35,160
what was down,
which had totally disoriented.

2499
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,470
This feeling of just falling through 
space.

2500
01:52:37,471 --> 01:52:39,990
It's a great opening to the book.
Yeah.

2501
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:42,720
We don't get a lot of that.
We don't get along.

2502
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:45,010
We.
We missed that part.

2503
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:47,630
Galactic part.
We really do.

2504
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:48,943
It's so unfortunate.
Whenever I'm out in the country and I 

2505
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:52,040
look up,
I see it.

2506
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:53,280
I go,
Oh,

2507
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:57,080
I was in Utah a couple of months ago and
it was,

2508
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:01,460
we were way in the mountains and it was.
There was no light,

2509
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:03,080
just nothing,
and you look up.

2510
01:53:03,081 --> 01:53:08,081
It's just Phil Stars.
Every inch of the sky had stars on it.

2511
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:10,010
It's just,
it's.

2512
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:15,580
It's so humbling and I think it's such a
powerful image for human beings and it's

2513
01:53:16,161 --> 01:53:16,994
inspired so much,
so much pondering throughout human 

2514
01:53:20,511 --> 01:53:21,344
history and so,
so much philosophy and so much so much 

2515
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:30,220
of the way people interpret our position
in the universe is based on this image,

2516
01:53:30,921 --> 01:53:31,754
this undeniable image of the cosmos that
it's so magnificent and yet in our 

2517
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:43,760
amazing technological society that we've
created,

2518
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:47,180
we have a side effect and that side 
effect is light pollution.

2519
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:52,280
That light pollution has shut off one of
the most magnificent inspirations that's

2520
01:53:52,281 --> 01:53:55,670
available in the natural world.
It's available to us every night.

2521
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,910
Instead,
we block it out with fucking seven slash

2522
01:53:58,911 --> 01:53:59,900
11 lights and

2523
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,420
and that in touch with that,
not just,

2524
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:04,283
not just that,
but the wider sense of the that the 

2525
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:10,680
mystery that is represented by.
Oh yeah.

2526
01:54:10,681 --> 01:54:12,540
I don't know everything I'd done 
everything I know.

2527
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,820
Then sadly,
what do we have?

2528
01:54:14,821 --> 01:54:19,380
We have people like me have magicians 
doing tricks and psychic mediums.

2529
01:54:19,381 --> 01:54:21,810
We're tending to connect with the dead.
That's like our,

2530
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:26,490
our tawdry onset to the providing a 
sense of mystery there.

2531
01:54:26,491 --> 01:54:28,350
Just hustlers.
It's horrendous.

2532
01:54:28,351 --> 01:54:33,180
I sat in a studio audience wants and uh,
watching a psychic.

2533
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:35,910
It was one of those TV filmed ones where
there's,

2534
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,990
where there's an audience was just like 
said before filming starts.

2535
01:54:39,991 --> 01:54:42,270
He came out and he said,
so is there anybody here that's hoping,

2536
01:54:42,271 --> 01:54:43,104
you know,
hoping that someone's going to come 

2537
01:54:44,911 --> 01:54:46,710
through and all these hands go up and he
just asked people,

2538
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:49,140
so what are you hoping will come 
through?

2539
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:50,040
Okay,
what do they look like?

2540
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:50,874
Is there anything.
Because I'll let you know if they come 

2541
01:54:52,201 --> 01:54:53,190
through.
Is there anything I can ask?

2542
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:54,053
Any bit of information they could give 
me that nobody could possibly know that 

2543
01:54:55,981 --> 01:54:57,600
will prove to you it's them.
Yes.

2544
01:54:57,601 --> 01:54:58,320
Yes.
He,

2545
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:59,940
he drowned and he was wearing a red 
sweater.

2546
01:54:59,941 --> 01:55:00,774
Okay,
well I'll let you know if he comes 

2547
01:55:01,291 --> 01:55:02,124
through and then they start filming and 
he just says all those things to them 

2548
01:55:03,991 --> 01:55:04,824
and uh,
I think about the reason why that stuff 

2549
01:55:06,811 --> 01:55:09,930
is,
is like people do believe it is that the

2550
01:55:09,931 --> 01:55:10,764
lie is so ugly that it's so much easier 
to believe something amazing must be 

2551
01:55:15,481 --> 01:55:17,460
going on there.
Then just is it,

2552
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,340
is it just that ugly,
empathetic ally?

2553
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:21,800
It's such a,
it was such a,

2554
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:24,540
it was such a horrible experience.
So many of them them.

2555
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:25,413
Yeah,
I mean they have a television shows 

2556
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:28,563
where there was a medium television show
where this woman was connecting people 

2557
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:35,000
with their dead relatives and it was so 
fake.

2558
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:35,970
They're just,
the,

2559
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:39,800
the questions were shitty.
It was so poorly thought out.

2560
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:43,860
It wasn't just a lie was a live vitally 
moron.

2561
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:45,600
That's a shame.
That's the it.

2562
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:46,590
Oh,
that was,

2563
01:55:46,591 --> 01:55:47,424
I in one of my shows I had um,
I got like 50 people up on stage had 

2564
01:55:50,521 --> 01:55:51,354
like a,
like an audience thing set up on stage 

2565
01:55:52,501 --> 01:55:53,334
and I'm,
we're doing medium shit with them and 

2566
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:58,140
providing like,
like very accurate information.

2567
01:55:58,141 --> 01:55:59,880
But at the same time saying,
I am,

2568
01:55:59,881 --> 01:56:00,714
you know,
I'm lying,

2569
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:01,780
right?
You'll,

2570
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:04,440
your grandmother's telling me what,
she's not telling me anything.

2571
01:56:04,441 --> 01:56:05,670
I'm making this up,
you understand?

2572
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,980
And then after the,
so he's got to be.

2573
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:09,580
It was an interesting kind of like.
Right,

2574
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,081
right,
right.

2575
01:56:10,081 --> 01:56:10,914
And then afterwards,
I think it was the first night of doing 

2576
01:56:13,141 --> 01:56:13,974
the show,
I went out the stage door and I was 

2577
01:56:15,151 --> 01:56:18,030
talking to people there and there was a 
girl who'd seen the show and she said,

2578
01:56:18,031 --> 01:56:18,864
will you,
um,

2579
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,500
I wonder if you could put me in touch 
with my dead grandmother?

2580
01:56:22,501 --> 01:56:23,100
And I said,
Oh God,

2581
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:23,933
well,
I hope you understand from what I've 

2582
01:56:25,381 --> 01:56:27,600
just done that I don't,
I'm not really doing it.

2583
01:56:27,601 --> 01:56:29,430
That's kind of the point she had on.
And I understand,

2584
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:30,743
I know you can't Redo it,
but would you be able to put me into 

2585
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:37,330
Jesus' eyes an amazing capacity for just
this kind of dissonance?

2586
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:39,300
Well,
that's how cults work,

2587
01:56:39,301 --> 01:56:40,200
right?
I mean,

2588
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:44,220
that's the only way they can work.
Once you get Ahold of the manuscript and

2589
01:56:44,221 --> 01:56:46,590
you,
you read whatever it was,

2590
01:56:46,591 --> 01:56:49,200
whether it's mormonism and Joseph 
Campbell,

2591
01:56:49,201 --> 01:56:50,034
the 14 year old boy who found golden 
tablets that contain the last work of 

2592
01:56:53,071 --> 01:56:53,904
Jesus,
only he could read with his magic seers 

2593
01:56:56,161 --> 01:56:57,170
stone.
If you,

2594
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:58,320
if you,
you know,

2595
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:03,900
if you have any critical thinking left 
in you at all at that point,

2596
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:05,430
you just,
you put the book down and go,

2597
01:57:05,431 --> 01:57:09,210
what the fuck am I doing with my life?
But people don't want that.

2598
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,770
They want,
they want the,

2599
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:11,843
the,
the universe is so open ended and the 

2600
01:57:13,891 --> 01:57:14,724
possibility of your,
your existence expiring at any moment 

2601
01:57:18,721 --> 01:57:19,554
and you just vanishing into nothingness.
And this consciousness which is 

2602
01:57:22,171 --> 01:57:25,500
literally stopping the lights go black.
And that's it.

2603
01:57:25,501 --> 01:57:30,501
It's so terrifying to us that we,
we would prefer some nonsensical,

2604
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:35,220
unrealistic version of something but 
rigid.

2605
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:38,850
So we know how to follow it and a bunch 
of other people follow it as well.

2606
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:39,803
And we have this community of people 
that fall away and we gain comfort in 

2607
01:57:41,941 --> 01:57:43,170
that.
And some very,

2608
01:57:43,171 --> 01:57:44,130
very strange way.

2609
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:45,563
There's a,
um,

2610
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,180
that's sort of an for me and an 
unexpected,

2611
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:49,513
um,

2612
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:54,990
comfort that comes with this sort of,
the meaninglessness of it,

2613
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:57,960
which I've sort of recently kind of 
found that,

2614
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:59,123
that all of the people in your life and 
the people that like people that you 

2615
01:58:01,861 --> 01:58:05,010
work with and see a lot of,
but that like annoy you and end up being

2616
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:08,610
like a cock,
a constant source of niggling irritation

2617
01:58:08,611 --> 01:58:09,444
like we,
you know,

2618
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:10,283
we have people like that or people that 
we kind of admire or maybe you're a bit 

2619
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:17,230
intimidated by or um,
or like Fitch is going to be the peak.

2620
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:18,113
They were gonna,
they're gonna be the people that just 

2621
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:20,640
kind of populated your life at what 
point.

2622
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:22,890
And it will amount to no more than that,
but there'll be,

2623
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:26,490
they'll be the people that were there 
and,

2624
01:58:27,070 --> 01:58:29,280
and it's,
it's hard to articulate,

2625
01:58:29,281 --> 01:58:31,350
but it's,
I find that like a,

2626
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:33,723
it's a lot easier to kind of love.
It's a lot easier to love when you 

2627
01:58:36,041 --> 01:58:37,930
realize that it isn't the end of the 
day.

2628
01:58:37,931 --> 01:58:39,240
It's all.
Yeah,

2629
01:58:39,790 --> 01:58:40,690
none,
none of that's gonna.

2630
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:41,590
None of going to matter.
The,

2631
01:58:41,591 --> 01:58:42,520
the,
the,

2632
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:44,680
the guy that's annoying you everyday is 
these,

2633
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:45,613
that's going to be,
that was that guy that was with you all 

2634
01:58:47,001 --> 01:58:48,040
your life.
Kind of annoying,

2635
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:50,630
but that was one of the,
one of these people and the puppet July.

2636
01:58:50,690 --> 01:58:53,440
I find it a very,
very powerful,

2637
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:57,940
uh,
kind of just just reset in terms of sort

2638
01:58:57,941 --> 01:59:02,830
of attitudes towards people that 
engender any kind of nervousness,

2639
01:59:02,831 --> 01:59:04,750
irritation,
intimidation,

2640
01:59:04,751 --> 01:59:07,090
any of those things.
It's like a,

2641
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:08,440
yeah,
these are just,

2642
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,740
these are my sounds,
but these are,

2643
01:59:10,741 --> 01:59:11,920
these are,
these are my fellow people,

2644
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:12,754
these will be the people that,
these would be the characters that 

2645
01:59:14,681 --> 01:59:19,030
people that populated my life.
And then that's kind of a nice thing.

2646
01:59:19,470 --> 01:59:21,510
So that makes sense.
Does it,

2647
01:59:21,511 --> 01:59:23,610
does.
So in embracing data,

2648
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:27,360
there is no great grand meaning to it.
All.

2649
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:32,340
This sort of intimidation doesn't,
it doesn't matter.

2650
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:33,203
It doesn't matter.
Their religious going through their own 

2651
01:59:34,740 --> 01:59:36,990
shared as well and I'm just a character 
in their lives,

2652
01:59:36,991 --> 01:59:39,330
but that's kind of Nice that like,
oh,

2653
01:59:39,331 --> 01:59:41,400
this guy was,
this person was with me every day.

2654
01:59:41,401 --> 01:59:45,900
Or even that famous person that maybe I 
never even met,

2655
01:59:45,901 --> 01:59:46,734
but like how weird that that was just 
like a force within my life at that 

2656
01:59:49,321 --> 01:59:51,660
person represented something,
you know,

2657
01:59:51,661 --> 01:59:52,251
these,
these,

2658
01:59:52,251 --> 01:59:53,560
uh,
um,

2659
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:56,730
said it's just a lot easier to sort of 
go out in the world with love,

2660
01:59:56,731 --> 02:00:01,731
which is ultimately what we need to try 
and do with that thought.

2661
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:04,913
I think

2662
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:05,943
don't listen.
That's a great attitude because anytime 

2663
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:13,860
you can have less annoyance by a person 
who's just,

2664
02:00:14,321 --> 02:00:15,154
whether they're ignorant or confused or 
agitated or whatever's causing them to 

2665
02:00:21,071 --> 02:00:22,750
behave in a way that's uncomfortable for
you,

2666
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,930
anytime you can just sort of just,
I Quito that and just sorta look,

2667
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:27,813
relax,
and let it roll off you and just keep 

2668
02:00:30,011 --> 02:00:31,420
moving and go,
uh,

2669
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:32,930
what are you going?
Do you know what I mean?

2670
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:37,330
That's one less thing you have to 
wrestle with in your psyche.

2671
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:38,350
I mean,
that's just,

2672
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:41,740
that's just a recipe for emotional 
success,

2673
02:00:41,741 --> 02:00:42,300
period.

2674
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:42,841
Yeah.
Well,

2675
02:00:42,841 --> 02:00:43,790
this,
the stomach are there.

2676
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:45,870
If you could only control your thoughts 
and your actions.

2677
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:46,830
So powerful,
isn't it?

2678
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:47,783
Anything else?
What other people do where they think 

2679
02:00:49,051 --> 02:00:52,340
everything else outcomes are not under 
your,

2680
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:53,243
not under your control,
so you can decide that those things are 

2681
02:00:54,721 --> 02:00:59,721
fine and that's such a,
a like to really let that idea drop into

2682
02:01:00,331 --> 02:01:01,380
the soul that,
oh,

2683
02:01:01,381 --> 02:01:02,214
it's fine.
What if it's fine if my partner handles 

2684
02:01:05,070 --> 02:01:07,430
stress battling drives me and what if 
that's what did,

2685
02:01:07,431 --> 02:01:08,700
that's,
that's fine.

2686
02:01:08,730 --> 02:01:09,563
Then I'd also,
that allows me then to be a better 

2687
02:01:10,321 --> 02:01:11,154
partner and maybe be more helpful if I'm
not internalizing it and making it all 

2688
02:01:13,861 --> 02:01:15,390
about me and you know,
making it,

2689
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:17,670
making it worse.
And again,

2690
02:01:17,671 --> 02:01:20,730
it sounds like a recipe for complacency,
but I like the tennis analogy,

2691
02:01:20,731 --> 02:01:21,564
like,
like so with success or with matters of 

2692
02:01:23,611 --> 02:01:25,980
social injustice where you think,
well I need to,

2693
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:27,173
I need to go out and change that in the 
world is then it's like a game of 

2694
02:01:29,221 --> 02:01:29,610
tennis.

2695
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:30,990
If you go into a game of tennis 
thinking,

2696
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:32,243
I must win.
Then what happens when you start to 

2697
02:01:35,221 --> 02:01:36,180
lose,
you become anxious.

2698
02:01:36,181 --> 02:01:37,014
You don't play as well.
You're trying to control something you 

2699
02:01:37,951 --> 02:01:38,784
can't.
Whereas if you go into that same game 

2700
02:01:40,431 --> 02:01:41,264
thinking,
I will play to the very best of my 

2701
02:01:42,801 --> 02:01:44,240
abilities.
That's,

2702
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:46,370
that's on the line of your thoughts and 
your actions.

2703
02:01:46,371 --> 02:01:48,350
That's something under your control and 
you'll play better.

2704
02:01:48,351 --> 02:01:50,890
You'll get better results.
That's,

2705
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:51,830
that's,
uh,

2706
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:56,830
that's become a big thing for me.
And when I get stressed about things,

2707
02:01:57,051 --> 02:01:57,884
I find that something is really niggling
away and bothering me that thought of 

2708
02:02:00,471 --> 02:02:01,304
like,
hang on it's face because it's always 

2709
02:02:02,931 --> 02:02:03,764
fun.
It's always something outside of the 

2710
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:05,474
thoughts and actions.
It's always something else and it is 

2711
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:08,294
fine.
It's normally just someone else's thing 

2712
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:12,560
that is just the way they're 
manifesting.

2713
02:02:12,561 --> 02:02:14,330
That is annoying.
Maybe it's fine.

2714
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:15,193
It is fine.
It feels like when I was a kid and I 

2715
02:02:16,971 --> 02:02:19,700
used to wake up on a Saturday morning 
and think I had to go to school and then

2716
02:02:19,701 --> 02:02:21,950
realized I didn't.
That kind of relief.

2717
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:25,260
I feel as an adult so much with this,
that kind of thing.

2718
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:25,770
No,
no,

2719
02:02:25,770 --> 02:02:26,603
it's fine.

2720
02:02:27,370 --> 02:02:30,430
Think it's a complacency thing.
You mean the idea is that you're,

2721
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,920
you're,
you feared that this attitude would lead

2722
02:02:32,921 --> 02:02:33,754
to complacency?
I think it just leads to you picking 

2723
02:02:35,711 --> 02:02:37,530
your battles.
Battles exactly.

2724
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:39,280
Which is important was your,
your,

2725
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:44,110
your wisely allocating resources,
right?

2726
02:02:44,111 --> 02:02:44,944
You're not,
you're not concentrating on some shit 

2727
02:02:46,271 --> 02:02:48,550
that you're not going to control anyway.
You know,

2728
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:50,470
grabbing some guy you don't even know.
Listen man,

2729
02:02:50,471 --> 02:02:52,000
you gotta straighten your fucking life 
out.

2730
02:02:52,030 --> 02:02:53,800
You're annoying and this is why.
And like,

2731
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:58,000
that guy's not going to listen to you.
It's just an ineffective way to interact

2732
02:02:58,001 --> 02:02:58,834
with people.
You're way better off going with this 

2733
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:04,930
fucking guy and just keep moving so 
myself out sort myself out.

2734
02:03:04,931 --> 02:03:08,860
And your reaction to him is the only 
thing that you could really control.

2735
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:09,933
Certainly can't control him,
but you can control your reaction to 

2736
02:03:12,791 --> 02:03:13,624
them and there's some,
there's a certain amount of pride in 

2737
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:16,323
just being able to like whatever and 
just to a person or a thing or person's 

2738
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:22,083
behavior that you might have been 
furious about just a few years ago or 

2739
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:27,513
you know,
or deeply irritated by where it would 

2740
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:33,650
cling with you for days you'd be in your
car or thinking about it like.

2741
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:38,930
But the ability to just let that go or 
to even enjoy it,

2742
02:03:39,530 --> 02:03:40,870
enjoy it,
enjoy it,

2743
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:43,070
it's good stuck advice which has come 
back now.

2744
02:03:43,071 --> 02:03:45,470
It's such a,
I think through CBT seemed to be the way

2745
02:03:45,471 --> 02:03:48,020
that CBT,
cbt,

2746
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:50,960
not a cock and bull torture the other 
one,

2747
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:53,480
cognitive behavioral therapy that may 
for all I know,

2748
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:56,490
both disciplines.
Um,

2749
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:57,403
but yeah,
the cognitive behavioral therapy is the 

2750
02:03:58,761 --> 02:03:59,594
kind of short form therapy that is 
essentially getting into the process of 

2751
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:06,374
how an anxiety pattern might happen and 
kind of throw a spanner in that works 

2752
02:04:10,371 --> 02:04:11,204
and make people by being more,
more aware of other possibilities that 

2753
02:04:14,331 --> 02:04:17,970
behavior kind of undoing it like that as
opposed to the longer form of therapy of

2754
02:04:18,710 --> 02:04:19,543
getting into a deeper dialogue with the 
self and tracing those things back to 

2755
02:04:22,551 --> 02:04:26,660
where they come from and so on.
But it is the,

2756
02:04:26,661 --> 02:04:27,800
uh,
the founder of,

2757
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:31,490
uh,
one of the founders of CBT was,

2758
02:04:31,491 --> 02:04:32,324
was,
um,

2759
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:34,520
was explicitly taking it from the 
stoics.

2760
02:04:34,521 --> 02:04:35,990
There's a very,
it's interesting how that,

2761
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:39,780
how that is coming back and I wonder,
I wonder what it is,

2762
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:43,860
what it is in a culture that's now made 
us [inaudible] he was very,

2763
02:04:43,861 --> 02:04:47,220
very popular now and there's that sort 
of awareness.

2764
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:50,940
It's a reaction against,
against psychoanalysis.

2765
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:54,960
I suppose it's a yearning for shorter,
quicker answers,

2766
02:04:54,961 --> 02:04:55,794
which may be taps into this difficulty 
in tolerating ambivalence and 

2767
02:05:00,031 --> 02:05:00,864
complexity.
Maybe a thing as a perfectly effective 

2768
02:05:03,601 --> 02:05:04,434
therapy for many things,
but it's just interesting how it's 

2769
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:09,780
coming.
This stoic audio is cultural cycles of

2770
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:12,640
sort of rediscovering things.
Yeah,

2771
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:15,330
and I think um,
I think that happens with A.

2772
02:05:15,331 --> 02:05:18,270
I think it happens with Yoga.
I think it happens with meditation.

2773
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:19,643
They become in vogue and then they sort 
of die out for awhile when a new 

2774
02:05:23,401 --> 02:05:25,950
generation sort of forgets it or doesn't
learn,

2775
02:05:25,951 --> 02:05:26,784
and then someone catches onto it 10,
15 years later and then it becomes very 

2776
02:05:30,121 --> 02:05:32,970
popular again.
Then it's in articles and magazines.

2777
02:05:32,971 --> 02:05:35,220
Then people started talking about it and
then yeah,

2778
02:05:35,250 --> 02:05:37,530
it's this weird thing that we do with 
that knowledge,

2779
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:40,320
you know what I mean?
This is our version of oral history,

2780
02:05:40,321 --> 02:05:43,980
we just pass things on and in this sort 
of a weird way where,

2781
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:45,110
you know,
we,

2782
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:46,083
we forget that these are tools and then 
people start discussing their benefits 

2783
02:05:50,791 --> 02:05:51,624
and discussing the positive results 
they've had with it and then it sort of 

2784
02:05:54,661 --> 02:05:55,370
builds up.

2785
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:57,440
It's a bit like the atheist argument 
thing I was saying,

2786
02:05:57,460 --> 02:05:57,831
uh,
as,

2787
02:05:57,831 --> 02:06:00,110
as an atheist,
but we hung up on the,

2788
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:02,173
knocking down the things that are 
actually just sign posts back to 

2789
02:06:04,881 --> 02:06:07,430
something that is important,
is vital,

2790
02:06:07,431 --> 02:06:11,240
but just very difficult to articulate.
When Nisha said that God is dead,

2791
02:06:12,140 --> 02:06:12,973
he meant that the sort of the young,
the unknowable God is now dead because 

2792
02:06:20,331 --> 02:06:22,580
we were,
now we've established this thing that we

2793
02:06:22,581 --> 02:06:23,414
call God,
which is just like the big guy and you 

2794
02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:25,490
know,
we've,

2795
02:06:25,490 --> 02:06:28,490
we've put like a box around it and gone.
It's that.

2796
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:29,383
And in doing so,
we've kind of lost that touch with that 

2797
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:32,173
numinous unknowable thing,
which irrespective of what you believe 

2798
02:06:38,150 --> 02:06:38,983
as like a religious believer,
the represent something that unknowable 

2799
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,140
force that,
um,

2800
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:48,400
led even as a,
you know,

2801
02:06:48,401 --> 02:06:51,050
a hardheaded rationalist is sort of like
there's a.

2802
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:53,330
yeah,
you want to make,

2803
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:56,740
you want to honor that thing because we 
never,

2804
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:57,683
we need,
we need to know what it is to step 

2805
02:07:00,591 --> 02:07:01,430
outside of ourselves.

2806
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:02,443
Yeah,
honor that thing is a great way to put 

2807
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:04,271
it.
I think.

2808
02:07:04,271 --> 02:07:05,104
I think we have a really strong desire 
for some sort of a practice of humility 

2809
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:11,260
and,
and,

2810
02:07:11,260 --> 02:07:13,060
and,
and true all.

2811
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:14,103
And I would love to be if you could go 
back in time and interact with people 

2812
02:07:19,661 --> 02:07:24,040
where everyone believed in thor and Zeus
and,

2813
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:25,073
and it would probably be absolutely 
fascinating to watch how these people 

2814
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:34,080
live their lives with this undying faith
in these deities were in control

2815
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:39,390
of all the matters of the unit with no 
scientific knowledge at all.

2816
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:40,443
It must be amazing.
And when you think about the fact that 

2817
02:07:42,731 --> 02:07:44,190
that was,
I mean,

2818
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:45,093
what,
how many thousands of years of human 

2819
02:07:46,931 --> 02:07:50,830
history people engaged with the universe
like that?

2820
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:52,620
There's other things.
There's only two,

2821
02:07:52,630 --> 02:07:53,463
300 years ago.
It was only with the enlightenment that 

2822
02:07:54,671 --> 02:07:58,660
we dispensed with the humor,
humoral theory of,

2823
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,553
of,
um,

2824
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:00,671
of,
of medicine,

2825
02:08:00,671 --> 02:08:01,720
you know,
we believed it was,

2826
02:08:01,721 --> 02:08:05,400
you know,
the fire and flame and all those,

2827
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:09,820
those kind of ethereal substances in the
body that's like that.

2828
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:13,230
Then it was only at that point that 
medicine became something that was,

2829
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:14,403
could actually start to fight against 
death ward off death to which means 

2830
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:19,331
death,
you know,

2831
02:08:19,331 --> 02:08:21,910
became the enemy.
And that's what we start to lose.

2832
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:24,380
That kind of respectful,
you know,

2833
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:27,580
death is some sort of companion rather 
than just some sort of stranger.

2834
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:28,401
But that,
that's,

2835
02:08:28,401 --> 02:08:29,234
that's only,
that's only a couple of hundred years 

2836
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:32,373
ago.
Um,

2837
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:33,510
so yeah,
look,

2838
02:08:33,511 --> 02:08:34,344
you know,
I'm a huge fan of the enlightenment of 

2839
02:08:35,621 --> 02:08:36,610
course.
And uh,

2840
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:42,450
as a magician of coals,
you very quickly develop a love of a.

2841
02:08:43,870 --> 02:08:45,400
well,
certainly you did that at that skeptical

2842
02:08:45,401 --> 02:08:47,620
attitude that magicians have had 
forever.

2843
02:08:47,621 --> 02:08:49,750
And it's kind of debunking and so on.
That was,

2844
02:08:49,751 --> 02:08:51,360
that goes hand in hand debunking the,
you know,

2845
02:08:51,370 --> 02:08:55,480
the charlatans and the whole world of 
sort of spiritual nonsense.

2846
02:08:55,481 --> 02:08:57,270
But,
but that's,

2847
02:08:57,271 --> 02:08:58,780
uh,
that's sort of a separate thing.

2848
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:00,310
That's a different,
that's a different thing.

2849
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:02,610
Um,
and uh,

2850
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:03,993
again,
I only can only articulate it at all 

2851
02:09:04,901 --> 02:09:06,610
because it doesn't,
it doesn't come naturally,

2852
02:09:06,611 --> 02:09:07,444
you know,
I,

2853
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:08,860
um,
it's,

2854
02:09:09,330 --> 02:09:10,163
we,
we find things that are sort of 

2855
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:15,490
compelling because they don't come 
naturally do this.

2856
02:09:15,491 --> 02:09:15,941
I,
you know,

2857
02:09:15,941 --> 02:09:16,774
I,
I,

2858
02:09:17,230 --> 02:09:18,940
I don't quite know what that means to 
me,

2859
02:09:18,941 --> 02:09:19,774
but I think if I,
if I knew too easily what it meant to 

2860
02:09:22,271 --> 02:09:24,160
me,
it might have lost something in the mix,

2861
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:24,880
you know,
I think that,

2862
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:29,650
I think the relationship to allowing 
your life to,

2863
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:32,373
to,
to grow and to transform into whatever 

2864
02:09:34,511 --> 02:09:39,070
that means has to be surely are

2865
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:41,453
Dr at some level.
Otherwise we'd just pacing up and down 

2866
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:45,750
by that window.
Yeah.

2867
02:09:45,751 --> 02:09:46,950
Otherwise,
what are we doing?

2868
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,410
What are we doing,
Darren?

2869
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:50,900
I don't know.
I don't know.

2870
02:09:51,290 --> 02:09:54,060
Know I need lunch.
Well,

2871
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:54,933
uh,
I have to go see if my house was burned 

2872
02:09:56,911 --> 02:09:58,800
to the ground because I do have it 
hasn't burned to the ground.

2873
02:09:58,801 --> 02:10:01,200
I hope so too.
Please Marshall's here.

2874
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:02,880
Marshall's here.
We're,

2875
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:04,980
we're all good.
My family was in a hotel.

2876
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,020
Um,
but thank you.

2877
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:08,790
Thank you.
So really fun discussion.

2878
02:10:08,791 --> 02:10:10,110
I really,
really enjoyed it.

2879
02:10:10,111 --> 02:10:10,741
Thank you.
So,

2880
02:10:10,741 --> 02:10:14,430
so much sacrifice is available right now
on Netflix.

2881
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:16,490
Now netflix as,
so there's three things on Netflix.

2882
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:18,120
There's sacrifice,
which is this brand new one.

2883
02:10:18,121 --> 02:10:18,954
There's the push,
which is the one we were talking about 

2884
02:10:20,011 --> 02:10:20,811
with the,
um,

2885
02:10:20,811 --> 02:10:24,450
the compliance experiment and there's 
also the state show miracle,

2886
02:10:24,451 --> 02:10:25,530
which was the,
um,

2887
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:27,450
the faith healing thing I was talking 
about as well.

2888
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:29,790
And then there's a whole 20 years of 
stuff on Youtube.

2889
02:10:29,791 --> 02:10:31,410
I don't know if you can even access it 
in this country,

2890
02:10:31,411 --> 02:10:33,150
but I bet we can.
I bet you can.

2891
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:35,460
Thank you.
Karen Brown please gentlemen.

2892
02:10:39,670 --> 02:10:40,503
Great.

2893
02:10:45,310 --> 02:10:46,143
MMM.
