1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,410
Uh, don't, don't, don't, don't,

2
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:09,490
don't bum, bum, bum, bum,
bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,920
bom hate fucks going on.
Party people.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,960
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast brought to you by Squarespace

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:21,660
score,
hair space.

6
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:24,270
If you've never been
and you need a website,

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,770
so stop what you're doing
and go check it out.

8
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:33,300
It's the easiest way to make a website.
You don't have to go to somebody anymore.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,910
Even though I've gone to somebody
in the past, my next website,

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,820
I'm going to try to make myself
if I had that kind of time,

11
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,890
I sort of have that kind of
time, but not really. I mean,

12
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,320
I guess if you just like put it in a
few minutes every day, you could do it.

13
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,740
Brian's been banging them out
while we do podcasts. He does.

14
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:50,850
He's done like 20 websites. It's that
easy. It's super easy. It's not just easy.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,160
It's the way it's set up. It's, it's,

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,450
it's set up like they're
really good websites.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Like it used to be that you had to learn
how to fucking html shit and you had to

18
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,890
learn how to,
you know,

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,670
put all those little weird squiggly
letters that you never use it in an email.

20
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,110
You have to figure out how to use all
those strange keys and arrows and shit.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,190
You don't have to do any of that anymore.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,890
Just go to Squarespace and you don't
even have to pay money to try it out.

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,950
You can go to squarespace.com try it
out and then if you choose to buy it,

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,550
use the code word Joe
and the number seven,

25
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:31,260
all one word Joe seven and you'll save
10% off your first purchase on new

26
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:35,940
accounts, including monthly and
annual plans. It's a sweet deal.

27
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:40,740
You can set up an online store.
They work on android phones,

28
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:45,510
I pads, I phones. They're pretty
dope websites and it's easy to do.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,040
Check it out. Mang do. Remember that
guy used to go chill? What was his name?

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,380
Check it out of my, check
it out. [inaudible] he was
in Scarface. Angel Salazar.

31
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,100
Angel says, ah, Eh, that was this
whole thing. Check it out. Check.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,960
And he used to be
everywhere and everywhere.

33
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:05,510
You would hear just a crazy angel cells
are partying story like angel sells.

34
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:09,330
I always hear of him like that,
that that Mitsis got on their wall,

35
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,600
the store and in Hoya and
he's like in a half shirt,

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,780
got off this hair feathered a Bandana,

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,080
like roller blades in one
hand and it's just so weird.

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,140
I met him once a few years ago when I
was on tour with Charlie Murphy and John

39
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,600
Heffrons. What's he doing? Good guy. He's
still in clubs still, you know? Yeah.

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,830
There's those guys man, like go to
long island, go to Long Island and go,

41
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:35,610
you know like see the guys who are like
thought local long island guys are still

42
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:39,710
around. They've been around for a long
time. Funny guys to like Joey Cola. Right?

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,920
Funny Guy. Just stand up for that long.
Yeah, they just put their, you know,

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,680
just sort of,

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,080
they stay around sort of on the periphery
for whatever reason the rest of the

46
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,930
world was and find out about them.
It's straight. I don't think, you know,

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,010
it's funny,

48
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,700
I don't think I'll ever stop doing standup
regardless of you want to do it for a

49
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:00,100
lot of people. But I, you know,
stand up is one of those things.

50
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,180
Who has that great philosopher, said
man's never more himself when at play.

51
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,970
I think those angel styles are and
Joe Salazar and the idea, the idea,

52
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,960
I say shake it out,
but the idea is when I'm not on the road,

53
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,620
when I'm not doing stand up,
you know,

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,360
I really start to miss it so I
can understand that you just,

55
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,430
you do it cause it's when
you're the most authentic.

56
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,710
Maybe you do because you're trying
to get the fuck away from your house.

57
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,090
If you also go to [inaudible] dot com
that's our last sponsor, o. N, n. I. T.

58
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:30,091
You'll see that although we only have the
chimpanzee tribal bell in Primal Bell,

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,720
tribal bill, primal, primal,
tribal, all those douchey words,

60
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,340
we have a new gorilla one coming out.
It's going to be fucking bad ass. Yeah,

61
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,010
it's a 72 pounds. It's sick. It's awesome.

62
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,400
The sculpture is a cool as fuck. And
we've got a few more coming after that.

63
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,940
We're slowly trickle in. The
men, very difficult to make,

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,230
very difficult to produce.

65
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,980
Difficult to also because we make
sure they're balanced. Um, the,

66
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,890
the thing is an entirely,
like if you look at a regular kettle bell,

67
00:03:57,891 --> 00:04:02,470
it's very simple. It's very, you
know, to symmetrical shape this,

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,950
the circle and then the handle is on it.
It's a nice big thick handle.

69
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,510
They balance it sets in the middle.

70
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,020
But when you have a sculpture
like a chimpanzee, not that easy.

71
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:14,440
So we had a map it out and design it and
make sure that when you work out with

72
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,630
it, it works exactly like
a regular kettle bell.

73
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,930
And that's the same for
the gorilla one as well.

74
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:21,310
And then the other ones
we have coming out too,

75
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,850
we had to change faces and redesign
things and move things around.

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,870
It's a real pain in the ass, but we wanted
to make sure that they look bad ass.

77
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,380
And there were also functional. They're
going to use my face apparently to,

78
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:36,580
there's word of that, a million pounds,
what? I heard million pounds, £1 million.

79
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,350
They use them for those bell with my face.
Those Pacific Rim robots,

80
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,890
they're going to train with them. Um,
if you've never used kettlebells before,

81
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:48,220
I always tell everybody, but I
think it bears repeating. Um,

82
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,080
he got to go to a trainer,
go,

83
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,170
go pay somebody a hundred bucks
or whatever the hell they charge,

84
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,620
and someone who knows what they're doing
and just videotape it and just get them

85
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:59,980
to go through the basic movements of it.
Start slow.

86
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:03,820
Don't lift a shitload of weight,
lift lightweights correctly.

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,780
I have a 35 pound kettle bell that
chimpanzee kettlebells, 35 pounds.

88
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,510
And I know he would look in a manly man
like myself, and he said, Joe Rogan,

89
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,090
what could you possibly do with 35 pounds,

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,550
which you get your tie on the ball with
it or what you can you get exhausted?

91
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:18,160
Trust me, the one that we
have that we sell and on it,

92
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,910
it's called the Keith Webber
Cardio extreme cardio workout.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,830
And these DVDs that we sell extreme
cardio and extreme to their fucking insane

94
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,010
35 pound cattle.
But I've done them with the 50.

95
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,020
You want to have a goddamn heart
attack. It's insane. It's amazing.

96
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,500
Do it like a 45 pound or how
long is the workout for? Well,

97
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,260
there's a series of workouts. It's
a bunch of workouts. It's like,

98
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:41,020
it's almost really, how long
can you do it? You know,

99
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,770
it was like a bunch of them that go back
and forth and back and forth, you know,

100
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,870
but the, the, once you start doing reps,

101
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:50,320
you start doing like windmills and cleans
and presses and over and over and over

102
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:50,740
again.

103
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,550
It's just unbelievably good as far as
like a strength and conditioning workouts,

104
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,820
the best as far as it.

105
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,380
And it gives you great cardio too and it
gives you functional strength go to on.

106
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:04,640
And that's o, n n, I, t,
a. As I mentioned, the uh,

107
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,930
the results of the Alpha brain
tests, the um, what do they call it?

108
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,550
Double Blind, double blind placebo
tests, which were very positive,

109
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:16,370
will be released soon. We're just got
it. We got to get them published. But a,

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,780
we're also on a, onto another one
onto another larger tests. Uh,

111
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,800
large scale,

112
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,000
even more expensive test just because you
think it's necessary to make sure that

113
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:29,100
people don't have any questions about,
you know,

114
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,390
whether or not something's effective.
We don't want any claims of snake oil.

115
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,290
No one's trying to rip you off.
The way we have it set up at on it is all,

116
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,370
all the supplements that you buy,
whether it's shrimp tank or Alpha brain,

117
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,810
the supplements all
have a 30 day or 90 day,

118
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,370
30 pill money back guarantee.

119
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:50,240
So if you buy the first 30 pills and
within 90 days you say, this is bullshit.

120
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,150
This doesn't do anything for me.
You get 100% of your money back.

121
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,830
You don't even have to
send the product back.

122
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,910
The reason being is because we're sure
that everything that we sell does what it

123
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:03,080
claims and you're going to
enjoy it. Whether it's new
mood, which is very simple,

124
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,040
scientifically proven,

125
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:08,330
it's five HTP and improves your
brain's ability to produce serotonin.

126
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,220
You produce more. Um, there's also a El
trip to fan which converts to five HTP.

127
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,260
All that stuff is great for your
mood. That's real. Like there's the,

128
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,590
in fact they tell people who are on Ssri
is to not take five HTP because you can

129
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:22,760
get too much serotonin.

130
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,630
They tell you to avoid that and just
take their pharmaceutical medication that

131
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:28,280
seems anything wrong with
farms pharmaceuticals.

132
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,990
But I am saying that you can get a boost
in your mood from taking something like

133
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:36,790
new mood and it's can't Kate
guaranteed. Um, use a code name,

134
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,660
Rogan and save 10% off any supplements.

135
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,930
Brian counters here and we're
fitting to get busy because we do,

136
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,820
that's what we do. Going hunting again
this November together with Steve Rinella.

137
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,350
We don't fuck around and get the bag
three back in action. Boom. Schelok lock.

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,150
Boom.
Here we go.

139
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,593
Experience

140
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,680
wee baby Jesus.
Jesus,

141
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,603
Louisa,

142
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,490
Brian motherfucking Callan.
Also known as by the way,

143
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,060
or the kid.
I refer to myself as as a kid.

144
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,170
Whenever I'm on set now I
make the cameraman, everybody
refers to me as a kid.

145
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,060
Like they're like, if the kid can
you just move to the left? I'm like,

146
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,830
have you been on when you've been doing,

147
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:33,831
I just did a stint on a movie
called flock of dudes and uh,

148
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,150
that's it.
I've just been doing,

149
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,500
I like to take long the long breaks
between my acting, but I just did a movie.

150
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:43,830
I did a movie a little bit with the
Elizabeth Banks who's 40 and couldn't look

151
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:48,540
better. Who's bit banks is. Um,
she sent it in a ton of movies.

152
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,160
I don't know if she's done
the chick from showgirls? No,

153
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,690
that's Elizabeth Perkins or
something. Who knows? But this,

154
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:57,780
this don't you say who nurse
knows about showgirls? Dude,

155
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,110
just don't actually know her cause I used
to date her friend when I first got to

156
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:05,490
La. So who were the showgirls? But yeah,
Elizabeth Hurley. No, it's not a reason.

157
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,500
I really don't, don't ever chime in if
you rob Berkeley, Berkeley, Berkeley,

158
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:15,350
ladies and gentlemen. What a pretty
face and honey, you know. Okay.

159
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes. Not, nothing special. Don't
believe she's a dancer. Before we start.

160
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:23,730
I just want to, can I just, can I just
hawk a date? Yeah. Before we start.

161
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:27,240
Go ahead.
This weekend at the Schomburg Improv,

162
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,800
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Brian
Callan, uh, enjoy your fruit compote.

163
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,720
Are Thinking about going there guys
to get too much. It's just too much.

164
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:38,660
It's too full of energy.
I don't want to deal with that.

165
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,850
I want to be in that presence. Just got
it. I know exactly who you are. You Ready?

166
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,430
Are you ready for hunting again? Dude
back. Here's what I'm worried about. You.

167
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,360
You had to choose November
21st in Wisconsin.

168
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,500
You think the Missouri breaks was
cold in October. We're going to fail.

169
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,190
It's going to be cold. Why are you
such a pussy? Because I am a plus.

170
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,860
I've got a long neck and I can't
conserve heat. That's why we're close.

171
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,930
I remember short neck and wide, wide
center of gravity. You retain heat.

172
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,490
We were freezing on that boat and you
come by me and you were like, Hey,

173
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,180
you had icicles on your beard and
you were smiling at me. I was like,

174
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:12,270
what are you smiling? I grew up in Boston
and I know how to deal with the heat.

175
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,610
Oh, I know how to deal with the
cold. Rather you just deal with it.

176
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,690
He's just deal with it. You just
accept it. Are we sleeping? Oh No, no.

177
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:21,470
Not this time. I'm going to
sleep in the cabin. Really? Yeah.

178
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,520
We're going to have like, it's going
to be like a real place. We can.

179
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,700
You have a bed? The whole
deal. Everything's going to
be beautiful. I can't wait.

180
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,140
We're gonna have a good time.
That's no problem.

181
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,660
Then we're going to have a good time.
Don't be a pussy. No, I'm going to be fun.

182
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,900
I get to keep your live there.
Those people live there all year round.

183
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,380
It's from Wisconsin. They fun. Yeah,
I've talked to in the north woods.

184
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,940
I bet you have. Yeah. I really have. You
been to Chicago in January? I sure have.

185
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,090
I've done a few gigs in
Chicago in January. That's,
Ooh. Ooh. They don't play.

186
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,410
Don't play around with that.
They don't play around with that.

187
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,770
I just got back from Alaska. You did?
Yeah. I went salmon fishing up there.

188
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,590
I didn't tell you about that.
Ari should fear and I went up there.

189
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,730
You know already that outdoorsman you
should fear. It can hang. I can hang.

190
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,240
I bet he can. He can. He finds his way
through. Right? He's a smart motherfucker.

191
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,240
Yeah. He knows how to do anything
he wants to do. That's what it is.

192
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:09,180
He gets good at anything. He wants to
get good at it and it's just, you know,

193
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,140
he's the real deal. Well, what did you,
did you catch any salmon? Yes. You know,

194
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,600
I went to Alaska and went and
fishing. Did you really? Yes.

195
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,230
You turning this around on your slide
caught nothing. So I'm asking you a few.

196
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,360
I literally caught nothing.
Oh. And by the way,

197
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,680
we spent $600 to take a go
deep sea fishing. Me and my
father, guess who got sick?

198
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,220
Both of us were like, Hey, can
we turn this boat around? Yeah.

199
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,990
You going to hear about,

200
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,580
you're just kind of go with a guide
and then you get salmon. That pig. Oh,

201
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:36,770
what is that dinosaur? What is
that? The 40 pounds. Salmon.

202
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,640
Yeah.
We caught a ton of them.

203
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:43,530
We caught seven of them one day
and then another day we caught,

204
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,400
we caught four and I caught a wild
rainbow trout to now did you catch them as

205
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:52,090
they were coming to die? Uh, yes.
Yes. I mean essentially they're there.

206
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,010
They don't live, you know, they, they come

207
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,510
back up, they spawn. And that's a wrap
son. Did you see anything going on?

208
00:11:57,511 --> 00:12:01,240
You see any bear? We did not. We
saw eagles, so a lot of eagles,

209
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,660
but we are on the lookout for bear
saw a five Mousse inside of two days.

210
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,270
Moose are everywhere up there.
It's amazing. They're also,

211
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:10,260
they say way more dangerous
than a lot of animals. Oh yeah.

212
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,550
We saw it by the way too,
by the way, by the way, I,

213
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:16,750
the way we saw two of the Moose
had babies with them twice.

214
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:20,770
So out of the four we saw two mamas and
two babies in two completely different

215
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:22,870
areas.
So those are the most dangerous.

216
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:26,620
When you see a mother with her baby and
we saw a mother with her baby on a tiny

217
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,970
island. Our friend Matt, who's a, the
guide that we, uh, went out there with,

218
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:34,990
he took us to his dad as an island
with like a bunch of cabins on it.

219
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,280
We took a boat out to this island and
there's a moose and her baby on the island

220
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,150
and we're like, oh shit, this is a
small ass island. It's like a block.

221
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,750
And the Moose is like, what you're doing
here bitch? And we're like, oh shit.

222
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,650
I guess it's swam there. It's
a horse. Yeah, horse that swam.

223
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,930
You never think of a horse swimming.
They can swim.

224
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,530
They shortly swim like in the middle
of the water, like its deepest fuck.

225
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:59,260
And they swim right through
it. And by the way, that water,

226
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,190
and if I remember correctly,
even in the summer in the North Atlantic,

227
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,450
you got about 10 minutes, you fall in
that what? You got about 10 minutes?

228
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:10,480
That's not the Atlanta I fell. That's
the Pacific. That's what I meant.

229
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,650
I meant the Pacific. Don't ever embarrass
me on a podcast like that again,

230
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,970
just to help you get the email,

231
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,820
the email area of the Pacific
that's closest to the Atlantic,

232
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,780
that pub when it's
flipped around real quick,

233
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:27,400
when it flips around you and your
technical ideas about what a c is, a yeah,

234
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:32,080
but you got about, I think 10 minutes
to, to live that pleases is so gangster.

235
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,470
It's such a beautiful place to,
if you've been to Alaska, half,

236
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,080
you got to do stand up
there. Really? Fuck yes.

237
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,000
It's one of the greatest places in
the world where anchorage, I'll go,

238
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,200
you gotta go gotta go.
It's amazing. First of all,

239
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,680
these people are cool as shit.
All right. Yeah. They're like,

240
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,070
they're like the coolest people
like from Portland or boulder,

241
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,130
like those kinds of people except
to live in the Pacific. I mean,

242
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,910
as far up there as you can get, you know,
skip and a jump away from Russia. Yeah.

243
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,770
I mean, they're way the fuck up
there. Past Canada, it's cold as fuck.

244
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,520
It was three o'clock in the morning when
we were leaving the bar and it's bright

245
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:09,580
out. Wow. Yeah. It's weird. I mean
when we went out there it was actually,

246
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,510
the temperature was nice.

247
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:14,850
It was in the 70s the mosquitoes
are unfucking relenting. Oh yeah.

248
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,790
Relently you've never seen anything
like it. It's like they know they don't,

249
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,440
they only have a certain amount of time,

250
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,640
so like you get out of your car and
there's a hundred of them on you in your

251
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:29,200
face within seconds. It's
incredible. They swarm you.

252
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,880
One person with malaria in, in Alaska
could kill the entire state. Yeah.

253
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,630
They would just spread like wildfire
through these fucking cutty mosquitoes

254
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,980
there.
Unbelievable.

255
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:42,400
Like you've never seen anything like it
and get out of your car. It's a cloud of,

256
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:47,110
I'm just, I don't think off works with
those guys. It works. It does. Yeah.

257
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:51,470
Ddt, we used a whatever shit we
they bought, we bought it at Rei.

258
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,340
You know it works.

259
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,980
It works great. It's, you need it. You
need, it probably gives you cancer, right?

260
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,020
I mean,
who knows the fight.

261
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,410
They might be worth it though when
you got a cloud of mosquitoes. Yeah.

262
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,760
Believe me, I was in Utah last week
and I didn't use it in time. Now I got,

263
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,560
I got bites all over my arms,

264
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,950
those cold areas while I was in Indonesia
and I had to carry a sulfur coil.

265
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,950
You don't, oh by the way, uh, the way, by
the way, you, when you're in Indonesia,

266
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,860
at least don't think
that you're going to use,

267
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,300
please don't think that office is going
to work because those tropical bugs

268
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,860
scoff at it. They laugh at it too, that
I had to carry a sulfur coil and burn it.

269
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,980
And that's what kept the mosquitoes
away from you. Is that real?

270
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,780
How does off not work? Uh,
because they're just too,

271
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,830
they don't care. They're tropical
mosquitoes and tropical bugs.

272
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:43,550
So we would carry a sulfur
coil and you burn a sulfur.

273
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:47,840
Could you hold it in your hand and you
burn it as you walk? How about that?

274
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,270
And that's what keeps them elicit work.
Yeah.

275
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,600
How well does and it and cause we would
you track in the middle of the like when

276
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,210
I was still dark and then you set up a
hammock cause you don't wanna sleep on

277
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,280
the floor cause bugs will get
you so you can set up a hammock.

278
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:02,150
You lie in a Hammock,

279
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,290
you wait for the orangutan above you to
wake up now when you're in and then when

280
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,750
the whole forest wakes up,
it's louder than grand central station.

281
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,100
It's just you never heard anything
like in my life and your life.

282
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,260
Do the forest in the tropical
rain forest a louder than I put,

283
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,600
put me on the corner of
42nd and fifth avenue.

284
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,470
It's louder and I'm not exaggerating at
all. Is it mostly bugs or is it bugs?

285
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:26,270
Birds, monkeys, all together
just squawking different
crickets, different, you know,

286
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,950
grass, whatever it is. Create.

287
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,730
Just when the whole forest
wakes up you're like,

288
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:34,430
this is the craziest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

289
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,200
I mean monk but birthday and you're
just like, are you kidding me?

290
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,060
And it's mostly the bugs.

291
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,330
It's mostly the different bugs
that are doing weird things.

292
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:47,630
Like rubbing their license
together are, or frogs, you know,

293
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,590
that are woo, you know, and
I just couldn't believe it.

294
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,670
And you better carry a software coil.
User freaked me out.

295
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,800
When you told me about your
first experiences there,

296
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:01,630
when back when you were thinking about
being like a bug scientist because, uh,

297
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,600
you told me about the posts
that they had on the, the,

298
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,240
where you slept and you had to
cover them with turpentines, right.

299
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,390
Because of the ants, the
ants, when they're foraging,

300
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:14,060
what they'll do is they'll tell,
just crawl over you. No problem.

301
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,500
If they're hunting,

302
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,190
you better have tournament time on
those posts because they'll find you,

303
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:23,120
they'll come up those posts, you're
in your, you know, tent or you're,

304
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,910
you're in your bed and
they'll come and kill you.

305
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,020
They'll come and eat you and you
can hear them, you can hear them.

306
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:34,850
There's so many of them that you can
hear a weird sort of hum. So, uh,

307
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,680
that's what I'm walking.
Yeah.

308
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,950
Apparently you can hear them when they're
on the march when there, you know,

309
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,810
millions of them in their hunting.

310
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,610
You can hear the movement of
the ground or whatever it is.

311
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:50,250
As they move, as they forage
through, it actually makes a sound

312
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,210
to this.
Millions of people don't understand.

313
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,630
This is a real fact that the weight of
human beings is equal to the weight of

314
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:01,210
ants in the entire world.
Yeah.

315
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,190
Just think about how many ants
it would take to equal a person.

316
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,250
How many millions of ants it was.

317
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,350
You'd have to stack right on top of each
other to equal the weight of a normal

318
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:10,460
person. Well, the,

319
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,520
there's an equal number of pounds in
the world of human as there are of an,

320
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,150
well, I, I got to my mind really blown
it. I had a guy on my podcast recently,

321
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:23,920
James Rollins, who is a like a, right?
He's like that Michael Crighton and he,

322
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,950
he went and spoke to some
mathematicians at NASA and the latest,

323
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,350
um, they, they had all
these really weird theories,

324
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:35,190
which is we're basically living
in a hologram. The [inaudible].

325
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,320
Have you heard about this? Oh yeah. Yeah.
It's, it's a blue my, then they said,

326
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,300
then they said no. He said, well,
what do you mean? He said, well,

327
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,790
if you were to take all the Ma,

328
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,460
all the space out of
the atoms were made of.

329
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,640
So if you take all the space, so he
took all the electrons pro, you know,

330
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,330
whatever that surrounds the nucleus.
If you put it all together,

331
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,200
you could take every human
being that's ever lived, the Ma,

332
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,360
the actual mass that we're made
of and put it into a baseball.

333
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,250
So then it raises the question of what
in the world is holding us together?

334
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,990
We're, I, if you look closely enough,

335
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,560
we are way more space and,

336
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:13,561
and what seems to be creating solid
matter is the relationship between,

337
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,590
uh, energy fields. There's no way
that they, as they look closer,

338
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,820
there's no way they can actually point
to like what we're touching right now.

339
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:26,140
Like this wood, it's really, it's
just, it's mind blowing. Like,

340
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:28,750
what are you talking about? Like
I, when he said that, he goes,

341
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,940
you could take every human being
has ever lived in. If you put,

342
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:32,470
if you actually took what
they're really made of,

343
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,890
the matter that the atoms are made up,
you could put it into a baseball, what,

344
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,400
stop it. Every human being. Yes. He went
to all this. Like he just did this pilot,

345
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,760
did the buckets.
He went through all,

346
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,460
all of this crazy stuff he
was talking to them about.

347
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,770
Yeah.
I had a guy from JPL,

348
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,450
this Dr. Richard Terrell,
and uh,

349
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,040
he was, uh, talking to me about,
uh, about simulation theory.

350
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,900
Tetell Terrell, I can't read this. Um,

351
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,770
he was talking to me about simulation
theory and he was talking to me about the

352
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:07,561
exponential growth,

353
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:12,560
who computers that literally the amount
of computations per second that the,

354
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:16,670
uh, the computers did the
largest computers back when
the Apollo Moon landing

355
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:17,510
program was going on.

356
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,890
The Mount of computations per second that
they were capable of is the same as a

357
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,390
key fob on a car

358
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,800
that's so vine boggling how,

359
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,830
where were going fucking beyond and saying
a key fob on a car is actually fast.

360
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:38,570
So crazy. It moves fast, stir

361
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,950
it makes more computations per
second then that giant computers.

362
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,840
It's not capable of the same thing,
but as far as computations per second,

363
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,591
your cell phone,

364
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:50,050
certainly as your cell phones of far
more far more than any computer back then

365
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:53,980
did, which was the size of our
room, you know, and they were,

366
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,440
what we're talking about is
one of the episodes of this,

367
00:20:56,441 --> 00:21:00,130
a new show that I'm doing, which premieres
tomorrow on Scifi Joe Rogan questions,

368
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:00,760
everything.

369
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,760
One of the subjects is the subject of
simulation theory about how insane it is

370
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:11,371
that you can one day rest assure
without a doubt 100% they will create an

371
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,930
artificial reality that is indiscernible
from the reality that you're

372
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:24,130
experiencing right now. There's
not a goddamn doubt about it. Not,

373
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,990
not 1000000th of 1% doubt that
if human being stay alive,

374
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,250
if we don't blow ourselves up, get killed
in a pandemic or hit by an asteroid,

375
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,470
if any of those things don't happen,
then within x amount of years fill,

376
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,550
fill in the blanks,
whether it's a hundred a thousand,

377
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,610
there's going to be a time
where the computation power,

378
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,760
the ability to manipulate neurons is
going to be at a level that you are going

379
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:53,641
to be able to insert an rd Fishel world
into someone's mind and then you're not

380
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:59,020
going to be able to know whether or not
you're in that mind or whether you are

381
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,950
in the real world. Are you
in an artificial world or
are you in the real world?

382
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,840
But here,
here's where it gets really freaky.

383
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,560
What if you're in the artificial world
and inside that artificial world you

384
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:12,130
create an artificial world.
That's where things get fractal,

385
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,010
which is essentially the nature
of the entire universe itself.

386
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:18,490
When you boil things down, when
you, when you get really small,

387
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:20,350
things get really big.
You know,

388
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:23,560
and when you're talking about all
the air that's inside of an atom,

389
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,510
you know all the space inside of the atom.

390
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,030
Well that sounds a whole lot like
the whole universe, doesn't it?

391
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,900
Doesn't that sound like a chair? It
does. Yeah. A mini, it's a mini universe.

392
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,430
Every galaxy is essentially,

393
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:37,510
and look at the distance between galaxies
and you look at galaxies and you look

394
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:38,051
at them and they like,

395
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:41,650
they look like stars because
they're so small and so far away.

396
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,090
But you see how far there is
between them and the next galaxy.

397
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,750
And then you realize that that little
small dot you're looking at is actually

398
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,380
probably three or 400 billion stars,

399
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,590
including a supermassive black
hole in the center of it.

400
00:22:56,591 --> 00:23:00,250
That's one half of 1% of the
mass of the entire galaxy.

401
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,800
And they go on forever. And there's this
massive amount of space. But I mean,

402
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,200
this is essentially a giant Adam.
It really is almost the same thing.

403
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:12,080
There's that theory that everything,
whether it's the sal,

404
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:16,900
a red blood cell or a skin
cell or you know, we are all,

405
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,470
it's all essentially, um, many universes.

406
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,150
They all mirror each other
on smaller levels. So,

407
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,560
so you've got the whole universe
and then if you look at a self,

408
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,540
you actually get into the minutia of a
cell and really look at everything that's

409
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,900
going on. It's every bit as complicated
as everything around us. It's,

410
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:35,950
it's just a mini version of that.
So we are reflections,

411
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,600
different levels of reflections of the
exact same thing just on smaller or

412
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,310
larger scales,

413
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,370
which is why the concept of creating a
simulation and inside that simulation,

414
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,050
creating a simulation is so fucking
nuts. It's like you're, they,

415
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,140
the real problem comes when what you
can simulate is exactly the same as what

416
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,860
you can experience outside of the
simulation than which one is which. Right.

417
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,030
And why is there a difference? What
says who so cause you can knock on it.

418
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,150
Well guess what? You can knock on it
when you're in there too. So it's real.

419
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:09,650
Then when it becomes real,
this guy,

420
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:13,250
James Rollins was again saying that they
were also talking about strength theory,

421
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,480
the parallel universes,
right.

422
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,600
The notion that there are different
realities right next to each other.

423
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:20,750
And maybe that's exactly what what it is.
That's where the Hologram,

424
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,880
this weird idea that, I can't remember
how he was describing it, but he, he, um,

425
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,280
she's got the buck as a,
but he was,

426
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,530
he was talking about how
there is like this, um,

427
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,820
it's like a third sort of, well,
it's basically a hologram. Basically.

428
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:41,690
The idea that there's a, there's
a riff, the, um, uh, this,

429
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:46,250
what we're seeing here is just a
reflective reality of something else.

430
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,620
That's something I don't, I don't
know. I don't even have, it's too hard.

431
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,390
I can't too stupid to actually repeat
what these people have their lives too.

432
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,410
It's like so rude to get it. Oh Man.
It's just like a whole, you know,

433
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,770
like the fuck it's, it. No,

434
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:04,850
it's not Jesus that did my
doctorate in that. You fuck.

435
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,400
It's, um, it's, it's so
incredibly complicated, but it's,

436
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,040
thank God someone's doing that work.
What do you know what, he blew me away.

437
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,030
He said that the Greeks had kind of
had this assumption, had this thought.

438
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:21,980
It was like a theory. So like in ancient
Greece, like this is not a new theory.

439
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:25,340
The idea that you're creating your own
universe in your mind and that you live

440
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:29,650
inside of some artificial
play that's being, well it's
what in in fact it's, it's,

441
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:33,680
it's Plato's allegory of the cave and
the idea that we live in a cave and

442
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:38,480
reality for most of us is
simply reflections on the wall.

443
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,020
It's, it's, uh, it, that's exactly what
this Holly man that God was saying. So,

444
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,070
so Plato's allegory of the cave is
that we are all in the dark and we,

445
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,450
what we think is real is
actually just just a, um, uh,

446
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,450
superimposed images, imagery on a, on a,

447
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,120
on a cave wall and where
you have to get out of that,

448
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,540
you have to climb up and follow the
light and then come back and tell people

449
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,340
about it. But that, that's
the allegory of the cave,

450
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:06,100
which is everything is
basically, um, forms. Uh, there,

451
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:10,700
there is the notion that you can,
you can, you may not know like the,

452
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,380
um, the idea is that you may not be
able to draw a perfect triangle. Okay.

453
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,500
It would always be off a little bit
even if you had all the instruments,

454
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,070
but you can imagine a perfect triangle.
You can imagine it.

455
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,240
And so the idea is that for, I
got another great example is, um,

456
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,280
this blew my fucking mind.
You have a mathematician,

457
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,030
he's 175 years ago,
comes out of a dark room and says,

458
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,400
I just came up with a
mathematical equation. Uh, by
the way, it's 300 pages long.

459
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,940
Uh, it has zero relevance to
the world and Oh, by the way,

460
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:47,100
I'm going to die now.
See Ya dies.

461
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,820
And here's this equation is
sitting there 175 years later.

462
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:54,900
Some guys measuring the difference between
like the relationship between quarks

463
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,480
and how it relates to this
and how it relates to,

464
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:00,900
and they're trying to make a gyroscope
at NASA or something or some kind of a

465
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:04,680
telescope. And they go,
Hey, guess what? This guy,

466
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:08,760
this mathematician 175 years ago,
came up with this mathematical equation.

467
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,770
What we're working on right now,

468
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,540
that mathematical equation is very
relevant to this physical reality.

469
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,950
So this guy has a dream,

470
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:21,951
comes up with a mathematical equation
that 175 years later bears physical

471
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:27,140
reality that we're using in our
cell phone or we're using, you know,

472
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,500
in a telescope or whatever it is.
It takes on a physical reality.

473
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,920
So whatever this guy imagined 175 years
ago in his mind for whatever reason was

474
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:42,420
put there and is used 175 years later
for something very physical and the

475
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:46,800
physical world. It's weird man. And he's
like, why was it, why? What happened?

476
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,540
Why did that guy think of that?

477
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,630
He was able to imagine a reality that
had no bearing on the world today and the

478
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:58,350
hundred 75 years later it
did. That's, that's where I
get really kind of, I'm not,

479
00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:00,020
I'm doing a shitty job of explaining it.

480
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,440
I know what you're saying.
W W we,

481
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:05,730
we'll you're basically saying is that
someone had an insight into the way things

482
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:07,530
work that no one else had achieved before.

483
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:11,550
And he was so far ahead that no one
could figure it out till 175 years later,

484
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,384
somebody revisited.

485
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,310
But it was also more than insight.
It was actually a physical,

486
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,950
measurable reality.

487
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,210
And he proved on paper
[inaudible] mathematically
somebody measuring the inside

488
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:26,330
of a conch shell or,

489
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,990
and how it relates to a beehive spires
or whatever and all of a sudden goes,

490
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,270
this mathematical equation is exactly is,

491
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,170
is proving my theory.

492
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,330
It's measuring what I'm using for
this particular physical reality.

493
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,193
You know what that is?

494
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,320
It's a great example of why we need
different kinds of people in this world.

495
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,730
We need it. We need a goddamn
broad spectrum. Damn right dude.

496
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,260
I was watching this Joey Diaz video today.
Uh,

497
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:56,850
Ari Shaffir has this new thing on
comedy central.com. It's called.

498
00:28:56,851 --> 00:29:00,870
This is not happening and it's all
people just telling the most fucked up

499
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:05,190
stories. It's like standup comics but
telling like insane stories of their life.

500
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,070
And Joey Diaz told one
about being on heroin,

501
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,570
about doing heroin and doing drugs for
years. And it was so fucking funny.

502
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,930
And I was sitting there watching it and
I was thinking thank God there's guys

503
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:20,931
like Joey Diaz out there to not just
so I could laugh and be around them and

504
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:24,960
have fun, but so that I'd
know what this stuff is like.

505
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,640
I don't want to do heroin.
Okay, I'm not going to do it.
It's not on the menu. Okay,

506
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,930
he's your, he's your getting paid. But
when you talk to a guy that's done heroin,

507
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:37,590
as much as Joey has done coke as much
as joy and he has these great stories

508
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:42,550
about it and the, and the harrowing
Harwin feelings of, of, of addiction

509
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,530
that he can relay to you
without you having hack ever
hack actually having to do

510
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:51,100
them. Right. So important. And it's also
important to have mathematicians. Yeah,

511
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,100
cause I'm not fucking,
you give me that big pile of paper.

512
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,980
You might as well have given
that to a chimp. Oh, of course.

513
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:59,740
And I ain't going nowhere. Of course it's
for, it's not, I don't have the time.

514
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,370
I'm going to be beaten off. I'm going to
take naps. I'm going to want to work out.

515
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,480
I'm going to look at my
biceps in the mirror. Me Too.

516
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,470
I to get up and eat all the time.
I'm going to go play pool.

517
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:11,140
I'm going to watch TV. I'm not
going to do that. I'm pretty,

518
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,880
I'm pretty disciplined, but I'm only
discipline with shit I like to do. Right.

519
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm disciplined with Jujitsu.
I'm do discipline with working out.

520
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,820
I'm just spent with doing comedy with
work. I like doing those things though,

521
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,320
so it's not really disciplined. The real
discipline is trying to do math. Yeah.

522
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,403
That's fucking desk.

523
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,880
Especially math theory where you're
thinking up these really these crazy

524
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,150
theorems that, that don't have
any numbers. Even numbers.

525
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:38,230
It's like letters and and weird
equations and and you're, you're,

526
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,890
you're following some thread that
then you know, the answer is,

527
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:46,891
and the answer is 170 pages long and
somebody out there and about the match.

528
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,920
Mathematicians go, brilliant. Well
guess what? Russian guy that found the,

529
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,370
the imposter theory.

530
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:57,080
If these seven pages long and
they wanted to give $1 million,

531
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:59,950
it's like I don't want that money. Right,
because he said, I'm, I'm actually,

532
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:03,190
you're giving, you're giving me the
money. I'm just the radio transmitter.

533
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:05,920
I was just, all I did was channel
it. It was always out there.

534
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,830
Give it to the theorem in the sky.
I just happened to have been,

535
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:13,540
I have a certain wiring that was
able to channel the the equation.

536
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,030
What was funny about that,
if I'm, if I'm not mistaken,

537
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:19,150
is they didn't actually even
know if the question was valid.

538
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:21,400
They didn't even know what
the, the, they didn't,

539
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,590
there was a theory out there that that
was actually a legitimate math theorem.

540
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,310
Our question like they didn't even know
if that was something you should even,

541
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,690
you were able to think about.

542
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,810
They didn't know if it a reality to
think about and he was like, yes it is,

543
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:39,520
or the more here's the answer. Well
there's Dan is more proof that there's,

544
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,120
there's, it's so important to
have a broad spectrum of people.

545
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,950
It's very important.
I mean,

546
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:49,540
you and I are not going to build a good
house if we don't have an architect.

547
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,390
If we don't have a carpenter,
we're going to do a shit job.

548
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:55,480
We're going to make a tent.
We're going to make some shitty lean to,

549
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:59,340
and we're just going to have to deal
with that until we dig up some books that

550
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,900
some smart people figured
out on how to make a house,

551
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,150
but it goes back to what I was saying
about the allegory of the cave.

552
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,830
You may not be able to achieve perfection,
but you can imagine perfection you,

553
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,320
you may not be able to
achieve that Theorem,

554
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,440
but that theorem can still
inspire something else in
you and that that in itself

555
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,590
is where we are connected.

556
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:20,260
That in itself is why other
people have tremendous value.

557
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:24,220
If you open yourself up to those kinds
of people, I always say that you you,

558
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,080
it's very important for young people.

559
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:29,260
I always talk about this and we don't
live in a world that fosters this.

560
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,620
We live in a world that's very
much about what you, your appetite,

561
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:36,880
how does this affect me specifically?
It's very important I think, to, to,

562
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,520
to expose yourself to things that
force you to reach beyond yourself.

563
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,800
That's where, um, somebody who does
something that has nothing to do with you,

564
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:49,310
but learning about it or at least being
inspired by how difficult it might be.

565
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:53,090
It could be opera, could be some great
piece of art that you don't understand.

566
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,630
That's not a bad thing to get involved in
or at least read about because it will,

567
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,100
it can,

568
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,330
it not only does it force you to kind
of to go beyond your own experience,

569
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,780
but I think it, you never know
how it's going to inspire you.

570
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:09,290
You don't know how it's what it's
going to spark inside of you. For me,

571
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,760
I derive a great deal of inspiration
from just being awed by that,

572
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:17,420
which I don't understand. Yeah. I
love to go see shit I can't do like,

573
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:20,180
that's one of the reasons why I
like to go see musicians. You know,

574
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,080
I love to go see live music cause I
have zero talent. I have zero talent,

575
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:27,100
zero desire, zero ability.
Like I know some Comedians,

576
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:28,460
I really wish they were rock stars.

577
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,500
I've never had a fucking single second
where I thought about being a singer in a

578
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,470
band or playing music,
musical instrument if you want.

579
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:38,900
Are you going to be in
Florida next? I Dunno. Okay.

580
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,490
There's a group called the flyers and
this kid named Patrick for readiness.

581
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,680
He plays a guitar and I'm, I'm just
gonna. I mean, if you're in Florida,

582
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,750
if you're a find this guy
Patrick freeness and the flyers,

583
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,680
he plays a guitar better than any,

584
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:57,170
I've never seen anything like
it. And by the way, I've been,

585
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,150
I was with music and say anymore by
the ways I'm done. What's happened?

586
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:04,760
You have no more, by the way. Okay. For
the show. The last, by the way. All right,

587
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,760
well just remind me, remind me. I wanna,
I wanna I wanna die every time we do it,

588
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:11,430
we say, do I keep saying that?
I don't, I don't hear myself.

589
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,500
He, he plays a guitar so well that I
was with other musicians and they, he,

590
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,660
he jumped out for a guest spot and they,

591
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,050
these two guitars came up to me and
they were like, I've never seen,

592
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:27,190
I've been playing the guitar in my
whole life and I have to photo my,

593
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,180
what's his name? Patrick Farinas. He goes,

594
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:33,080
I've never seen any like does he
have any things online? Not Online.

595
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,160
How's it possible? He's not what it
should be on. How old is he? 30 well,

596
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:40,760
how can we haven't heard of him because
he and I talked to him about it. He, he,

597
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:44,480
he's now doing original music before he
was doing a lot of cover stuff and now

598
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,760
he's doing, and I said, you've
got a responsibility bro,

599
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,800
which is you've got to start doing,

600
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,900
you've got to start doing
your own original expression
because it's one thing to

601
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:56,770
be technically brilliant, end
to db. Any empathize within it.

602
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,290
I mean he also improvisers. I mean,
dude, he does. He Act, he, he'll,

603
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,500
he'll do an amalgam, he'll do like
a composite set where you're just,

604
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,920
you're just like, what in the
world is he doing with the guitar?

605
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,870
There was something wrong with like
doing a little bit of cover band action,

606
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:10,010
like a few cover songs,

607
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:13,490
but that's a real trap for young bands
that want to perform in bars and make a

608
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:16,130
living because people don't want to
hear your fucking original songs for the

609
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:19,340
most part, especially as like background
music, whether trying to get laid,

610
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,970
you know, they want to hear
sweet home Alabama. That's right.

611
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,460
Saying it pitch right.
We don't want to hear my time on the lake.

612
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,200
But you get to a point when you,

613
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:30,650
when you reach physical mastery
like this guy has and, and,

614
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,960
and he's gotten beyond that.
He's very innovative with the guitar.

615
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:35,510
It's not like he's, he's not copying
clapped and he's doing his own thing.

616
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,010
There's a big difference though
between that and writing your own

617
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,960
music cause a difference.
It's like the ability to tell a joke,

618
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,960
you know that you stole from someone and
the ability to write a joke like that

619
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:50,460
yourself. We can all name a few people
that can't do one of those things.

620
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,500
We all know if you guys that are really
successful that have made a career at a

621
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:59,730
ripping off other people's ideas because
the fact they can't do both. Right.

622
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,420
This is the dude right here. Oh,
there is? Yeah. Looking at watch.

623
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,310
He's shredding does. She does the craziest
things on the guitar. That's one thing.

624
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,440
That's how that Joe Satriani type shit.
Right?

625
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,700
I like to use fat too. He's, he's lost
weight now, but he's having a monster.

626
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,960
He's a monster. He's playing guitar
with his face right now, folks. Yeah.

627
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,340
That's this guitar playing you're hearing
right now is with this dude's mouth.

628
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,350
That's pretty crazy. Yeah. He's
a nut. I've never seen any lives

629
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,673
Lorida.
Yep.

630
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,960
It's weird that that seems to be the
only good thing that comes out of Florida

631
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,280
is occasionally they have some good
musicians. Yup. Everything else sucks.

632
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,100
I shouldn't my, I have family
members that lived there. Folks.

633
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:04,740
I love people in Florida. Don't get me
wrong, my actual parents live in Florida,

634
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,090
but let's be honest. Let's be
honest. Let's be honest. Let's see.

635
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,850
Grace. Yeah. Nancy grace was starved
to death if it wasn't for Florida.

636
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:20,660
All right, Richard. I remember
talking about barely, but you know,

637
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:24,870
it's like they came up like Skinner came
out of Florida has been some good bands

638
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:28,290
out of Florida, but like name a good
comedian that came out of Florida. Yeah,

639
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,040
I'm waiting. I know. I don't know. I guess
Tom Rhodes did. Tom Rhodes come on. Flora.

640
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,820
I feel like Tom Roads are all
in there. Yeah, I think, yeah,

641
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,140
Tom Rhodes is from Orlando.

642
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,470
I just appreciate comedy or a
musical instrument or anything.

643
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:44,280
It takes a really long time to get
good at it. Yeah. I had a buddy,

644
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:49,320
I had a buddy that, uh, I got to dance
around this without giving out any names.

645
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,820
I have a buddy that, um, you
know, during the 80s, especially,

646
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,650
standup comedy was pretty fucking wild.
Okay.

647
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:03,210
There was zero accountability. There
was, um, there was no emailing.

648
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:08,140
There was no, I mean, people got coked
up and they did some wild shit and you,

649
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,881
you basically,

650
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:12,630
it was just a story you didn't have
to worry about someone like Facebook

651
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:16,800
picturing you tied up with a fucking a
hundred Dick's stuffed in your mouth,

652
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,420
good old days. But, um,

653
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,950
there was a woman that was like
working at a comedy club, uh,

654
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,570
like a manager of a comedy club.

655
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,870
My friend went down there to
perform and fell in love, you know,

656
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:32,160
and then started living down
there in Florida, but then
it turns out, as you know,

657
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:36,400
he was there for a little while. He
started, uh, people were like, Hey, uh,

658
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,240
can I talk to me for a second, pull them
aside. And they were like, just, you know,

659
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,030
I would want to endow this,

660
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,120
what I'm going to tell you so I'm going
to tell you and just do it just to come

661
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:49,770
in and town. Just run
terrains on her. And she was,

662
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
she was famous for like guys tying
or rob and like all their friends,

663
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:59,020
just, just fucking her face taking
pictures of it. And there it is.

664
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:02,320
It was just complete total chaos.
Like no,

665
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:07,321
I mean she was a total wild woman and
then this poor fuck came into town.

666
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,890
And uh, she winked at him and
gave him a hug and he was in love.

667
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,390
And so he moved there, you know,
and a crushed him devastate him.

668
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:19,510
Devastated his life. Cause he
married this woman. Yes he did. Yes.

669
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:24,130
And then he re along the way is sort of
like unfollowing like guys would come

670
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:26,220
into town and you know,
they had,

671
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,170
they had been running trains on her
for the last 10 years, you know,

672
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:33,100
when she was managing this club. So turned
out I got, what can we, are we partying,

673
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:37,000
which like I'm married now and they
were like, what the fuck you're married.

674
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,580
Like everybody was like, just
no way. That's not possible.

675
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:40,510
Like how's that possible?

676
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,580
And so eventually she went back to her
wild ways and uh, cause he divorced her.

677
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,490
No, well no, in the middle, you know,

678
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,660
like almost right away she went right
back to it. I mean while she was,

679
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:55,510
and so it didn't. So this poor
guy, I can't say any names.

680
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,590
This poor guy who was a friend, I really
liked the guy and we came up together.

681
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,580
We were in Boston, we were open microscan
either and he had some real potential.

682
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,970
But it's amazing how a devastating
breakup can affect people in such an

683
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:15,790
incredible way that they
emotionally never recover from it.

684
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,180
And it's one of the reasons why,
in my opinion,

685
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,630
it's so important to get children
involved in competitive athletics and

686
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:28,570
competitive things.
So they learn how to lose things.

687
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,070
They learn how to lose games.
You learn how to lose relationships.

688
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:36,400
He learned how to lose things.
Losing things is important.

689
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,970
Expectations that don't come
through all that stuff. Well,

690
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:42,790
it's also important to know that you
can bounce back when you've bounced back

691
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,860
before you understand about bouncing back.

692
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:49,861
But when you've only experienced
fear and then insecurity,

693
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:54,580
and then the devastating feeling of
loss compound ever want that again?

694
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,211
No,

695
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:59,650
you orchestrate your life so you never
fail again and you'll never take a chance

696
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:03,730
and never take a chance again. And you
also have to have friends. Those are,

697
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:08,140
those are, those are important
aspects, like a loner who gets dumped.

698
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,440
Those are the guys that put guns in
their mouth. You also need a mentor.

699
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:14,290
You need someone who's been through it
before. That's where a coach comes in,

700
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,970
so to help you navigate, not a
coach, a buddy of a group of friends,

701
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:20,920
a whole bunch of for sure,
but there's also, when you,

702
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:22,810
when you are trying to get
really good at something,

703
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:25,630
a lot of times you have somebody older
who can help you navigate through the

704
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:30,631
plateaus for sure that that's why I
just put your attention on something.

705
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:35,570
I don't give a shit what it has taken
action because there's always a lesson

706
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,970
there. It's almost like the
thing in and of itself is,

707
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,590
is less important than what you learn
by trying to get good at it. In a way.

708
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,730
It's also because these things
like breakups and these,

709
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:49,250
these devastating events
that can happen to a person,

710
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,110
they don't get treated with the proper
respect by the people that are raising

711
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:58,640
you. They get treated like, oh, someone
broke your heart. You're going to be fine.

712
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,520
Like it's not that
simple. Okay? You're you,

713
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:05,660
what you're dealing with is an
incredible shift in the emotional state.

714
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,380
And if this person does not
know how to navigate that shift,

715
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,600
they don't know how to
get out of that situation.

716
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:16,360
It can be a motherfucker getting
your ass kicked can do that to you.

717
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:21,020
You know? Um, being
humiliated can do that too.

718
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,140
You remember Kerry at
the, at the PR, the Prom,

719
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,770
and they just pour the blood on her
head and she just fucking goes crazy and

720
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:31,730
people start flying through the
walls and shit. But that's real,

721
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:36,731
that feeling that you can get when
people are angry at you or hate you,

722
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,060
that, that feeling, that horrific
feeling when you bomb. How about that?

723
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,950
Some guys bomb and they literally want
to go to the hotel room and slice their

724
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:46,730
risk.
I've seen,

725
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,720
I've seen three comics with great
potential do really well their first time,

726
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:52,720
do really well the second time
and obviously like standup,

727
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,490
they get up and try to do the same thing
with another crowd and they die because

728
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:58,670
it wasn't their friends.
They never do stand up again.

729
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,940
It's like they have potential
and they have great potential,

730
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:05,870
but they never do it again. You
know, this friend of mine, it was a,

731
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:10,100
an early lesson about what can happen.
I had some good early lessons.

732
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,400
I had a real nice girlfriend in high
school. She was a very, very nice person.

733
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:19,130
Like she was, she was not
mean at all, but you know,

734
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:22,370
when you're 14 years old, relationships
don't really last. And you know,

735
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:26,660
from her went on to other ones and uh,
one of the other ones,

736
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,770
um, I dated this girl
that was just, you could,

737
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,150
you could roll a dick
by her like a kitten.

738
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,150
Like you could roll a ball of yarn
by a kitten. They just jump on it.

739
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,320
That's what this girl was like. This is
the girlfriend, her girlfriend. Yeah,

740
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,800
she's pretty too.
And she couldn't help herself.

741
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:47,150
I mean, I, I just,

742
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:49,700
I've seen people that can help themselves
and I've seen people that can't,

743
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:52,520
this girl could not help herself. She
was, first of all, it was Catholic.

744
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,820
She was raised in Catholic
school and they, you know,

745
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:57,350
they suppressed the shit out of her.
Right.

746
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,440
They make you wear this one fucking
outfit and the suppressor shit out of you.

747
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:04,370
And psychologically like all you
had to do was get this girl alone,

748
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,850
like any guy could get this girl alone.
And that was a wrap. It was over. Yeah.

749
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:08,780
Yeah.
She was crazy.

750
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,900
And I didn't really even find out how
crazy she wasn't until after we stopped

751
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:14,500
dating and then she would tell me stories
like we worked together and she told

752
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:18,230
me stories about this new guy she was
dating and how she liked him to smack her

753
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:20,330
and he would beat her up and she liked it.
She was like,

754
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:23,090
I don't know what to do cause I like it.
It was just like it was the car.

755
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,410
She was so crazy.
Right.

756
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,900
I mean so it completely lowered
my expectations of loss.

757
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:33,630
Like I came home one day and uh,
I didn't actually come home.

758
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:36,870
I was getting up in the morning
cause I had a paper route cause um,

759
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:42,570
I delivered newspapers for a job
for a long time. Many, many, many,

760
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:46,680
many, many years. All throughout high
school. Like as soon as I could drive,

761
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,220
there was like one of my first
jobs and while I was fighting,

762
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,310
it was one of my jobs because I could
make a couple hundred bucks a week.

763
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:56,850
All I had to do was get up in the
morning by like 5:00 AM delivering my

764
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:59,250
newspaper route and then I'd come back
home and go right back to sleep again.

765
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,410
So I did that for a long ass time and
I would have to get up really early on

766
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,450
Sunday morning.
Essentially it would be Saturday night.

767
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,240
So Saturday night at four o'clock in
the morning, that's when I would be up.

768
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,403
And um,

769
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,500
outside my house is my friend and this
girl and he's fingering her in the front

770
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:17,180
seat.

771
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,680
Oh yeah.
She was crazy.

772
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,620
God girl was crazy. Oh, that's, so I
slammed my hand on the hood and I go,

773
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,590
ah. And they're like, you know,

774
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,240
like I was laughing at them and
then I got my car, I drove away.

775
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:35,420
I didn't say a word and I didn't talk
to her for like a week, you know.

776
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:40,250
But I mean it was, it was, she was not
my girlfriend at the time. It was a girl.

777
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:40,710
She,

778
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,590
that time she was a girl I was dating,
I should be really clear.

779
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,430
Like I don't think there was ever a time
when we were like officially boyfriend

780
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:50,830
and girlfriend. We were just dating the
whole time because she was crazy. You

781
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,080
know what helped me a lot.
It was crazy to what helped me a lot.

782
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:57,680
Navigate loss and things is actually
movies. A good movie. Yeah. Like uh,

783
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,470
like say it again, let know
like rocky, like rocky and
stuff. When I was wrestling,

784
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:07,090
I remember like you think about the study,
any that's a great movie by the way.

785
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,820
No, it's fine. You think of
the seminary, I loved it.

786
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,400
But you think of these seminal
moot moments in your life.

787
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:14,040
And I remember I was
signed up for, I was, uh,

788
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,800
I went to boarding school because my
family was still in Saudi Arabia and I'm

789
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,910
like alone there.

790
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,540
And I signed up for jogging cause I
was too afraid to sign up for wrestling

791
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,600
because I had done judo before that I
was like, ah, these guys are too tough.

792
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,610
So inside of a jogging,
this kid,

793
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:30,250
Gary Lane had seen me put some kid
in a headlock and he goes, hey.

794
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:33,520
And he drags me over to the
wrestling mat and I just signed up.

795
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:36,490
And next thing I know I was wrestling
and I wonder what I'd be if I hadn't,

796
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,410
you know, been a wrestler.
It changed my whole life.

797
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:43,000
But the idea of like when I would,
when I would lose at something,

798
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,200
I remember like I would think back to my
heroes in movies like rocky or whatever

799
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:50,500
and just, and it just, the
example of if you lose,

800
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,350
keep trying and you'll win in the end.
It was always that feeling.

801
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,920
I think that in that sense, that's where
art or, or movies can play a big role in,

802
00:46:56,921 --> 00:46:57,880
in your life. Man. Yeah.

803
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,940
But it could also give you some bullshit
idea that that white guy could really

804
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:04,750
beat up that black guy.
Come on.

805
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,230
Don't ruin rocky for me, Bro. For Real.

806
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,670
Five foot 860 pound man, it's really
the heavyweight champion of the world,

807
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,920
by the way. That's exactly
right. He was 155 pounds when he,

808
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:22,240
when he did rocky. Let's really that
light. Yeah. How do you know that?

809
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,960
That's what I read a long time ago.
People lie about shit.

810
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,050
It's not a big frame guy right
now. He is, he looks big.

811
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,840
But his body was, if you look at it was
10 I use of growing, bring up a rocky,

812
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,550
uh, for when he fought Drago. Take a look
at this frame. You can see his legs thin.

813
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,610
Well,
which you really should put up his,

814
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:46,000
him at 66 years old.

815
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,830
There's a picture I put on
my Twitter the other day.

816
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,720
Did you see what Geraldo did?
No.

817
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,370
Geraldo Rivera put a picture of himself,

818
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:58,450
a naked essentially with
his, uh, his, his towel,

819
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:03,451
like barely over his cock and
it said like 70 is the new 50.

820
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,710
Is Geraldo seven years old? Yes, he's
seven years old and he looks really good.

821
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,790
Let me see a picture of place. It's
all over the Internet. And he pulled,

822
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,020
what's really funny is he took it down,

823
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,530
he put the picture up and then he
decided, it was like, you know, I dunno,

824
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,180
it's two to move to embarrassing.
Fucked up. You know, look at that.

825
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:27,160
Look at that picture. He's
awesome. He looks great.

826
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:30,610
Look at that picture, man. He's
still got that awesome mustache. Oh,

827
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:34,180
the mustache is a motherfucker.
Look at that. And he boxed. He was,

828
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,580
I think it was kind of a good feedback.

829
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:40,660
I pulled his cock out and it was holding
his knuckles up and going outside like

830
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:45,250
karate chop hand forward
towards you with his fat cock.

831
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,440
You would be nervous if you,
if you broke it,

832
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,860
that guy's House and his Cock was
oiled up and he was knuckles up.

833
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,290
Just just pulling it in your direction.

834
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,400
You would jump drop your gum and jump out
of Lens for an image I've never had in

835
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:01,000
my head. Did you have that image? Look,
look at how low it keeps the towel.

836
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:05,500
Like you insane bastard. He's great.
He looks great though. Seven years old.

837
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:09,070
Light skin. First of all he looks like
he's about 8% body fat. I mean seriously,

838
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:13,120
look at all the striations at his chest.
Obviously works hard.

839
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:15,100
He's in incredible shape.
No doubt.

840
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,730
But I don't know why he didn't keep it
up there. Fuck all those people, man.

841
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,530
Let them get crazy. And you had 70 are
allowed to do that at 70 that's fantastic.

842
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,020
You're not, you're not. If
you're a man, if you're a woman,

843
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:29,650
you're allowed to do that at any age.
A woman can do that at any age.

844
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:33,430
You know why? Because we want
to see it. Cause put a man,

845
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,000
no woman wants to see that and no
man wants to see. Yeah, so it's a,

846
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,460
it's a dark corner.
It's like women are not,

847
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,240
I guess it's probably like a few 60 year
olds that are like, I still can get wet.

848
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,780
No. I heard somebody say one time
the difference in men and women,

849
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,380
somebody said it was describing.
I said,

850
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,460
women look really good static and men
look really good when they're doing what

851
00:49:51,461 --> 00:49:53,170
they're good at.
Like so when they're moving,

852
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,510
when there's movement playing a guitar,

853
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,180
just kicking the soccer
ball and maybe it's not,

854
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:00,850
I don't think it's really a
visual thing as much with women.

855
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:05,020
Certainly an aspect of it, which is why,
you know really handsome men do well,

856
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:05,641
I mean there's the,

857
00:50:05,641 --> 00:50:09,330
the facial features and everything that
the Senate Fibonacci sequence. Yeah,

858
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,910
the symmetry of the face and that's,
that's super important to people.

859
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,260
But for women, there's all these other
variables to personality, sense of humor,

860
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,060
the ability to take care of yourself.

861
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:23,740
Look at Stallone at 66 stop it
shut to shut the fuck up man.

862
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,450
Are you kidding me?
That's insane.

863
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:31,170
The inside black and sponge lights
his entire inside of his body.

864
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:34,370
It's like it's waiting to make its
way to the surface of his skin.

865
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,280
I want what he's on and I
don't care what anybody says.

866
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,820
And when you look that good at
66 he, I, I'm very impressed.

867
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,670
That's my Canarian Nicole
on. Yeah, no kidding. Here's,

868
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,380
here's the other thought about that.
Like um,

869
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,360
people look to what were the negative
side effects? Um, you're 66. Okay.

870
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,710
That's the negative side effect.

871
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:55,640
The negative side effect is being 66 no
matter what negative side effects that

872
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:58,940
drugs have shit on death.
Okay.

873
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,450
Cause death is the ultimate
negative side effect of life itself.

874
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:05,570
And it comes a certain point in time.
We're death becomes inevitable.

875
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,720
Whether it's at 66 or whether it's at
86 you cannot have a physique like that

876
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:14,240
and less you incorporate science
into your diet. Oh, okay.

877
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,890
Not getting that from just doesn't exist.

878
00:51:15,891 --> 00:51:19,190
Lifting weights and eat and nothing
existed. 66 it exists at 30.

879
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:23,300
There's 30 year old guys that are
built like that that have never touched

880
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,310
hormones,
never done anything.

881
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,280
There's guys that are in their
forties that it looked fantastic,

882
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:31,850
that have never fucked with
anything unhealthy in their life.

883
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,360
Never done a steroid,
never supplemented their testosterone,

884
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,660
never done anything but
eat good and work hard,

885
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:43,220
but at 50 and then 66
and they don't exist.

886
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,360
They don't exist. You can't
look like that. You know,

887
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:50,040
you know what's on the horizon for
hormones? Oh fuck yes. I do. What Tom?

888
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,070
Not only do I know what's
on the horizon for hormones,

889
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:55,640
hormones are this just one
aspect of the human body.

890
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,410
The most fascinating conversation that
I had recently for the show, um, was a,

891
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:04,460
I got a chance to talk to Ray Kurzweil.
Oh my God. Did you really? Yeah,

892
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:08,150
I interviewed him for over an hour. He's
great. He's, first of all, he's a sweetie.

893
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,350
He's a really nice guy.
Like kind easy to communicate with.

894
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,710
Intelligent. There is, there's us
together. Oh my God. Great Guy. Um,

895
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:21,730
but what he was talking about was these
new innovations in modern science and

896
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:29,501
medical science that are going to allow
people to literally have super human

897
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:32,480
abilities out of the gate.
Nanobots stuff. Yeah.

898
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:36,080
You're going to have a real problem
with like shit like the Olympics when a

899
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:40,700
person like you can take a shot and
then all of a sudden you have these like

900
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,110
artificial blood cells that are a
million times more effective. He said,

901
00:52:45,111 --> 00:52:49,100
you are literally going to be able to
hold your breath and jumping. No, no, no.

902
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,390
Four hours.

903
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,680
Jump into the bottom of the pool and hold
your breath for four hours on a single

904
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:59,300
breath. Yeah. Four fucking hours, man.
That's in the singularity is near.

905
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,720
Yeah, that's, but when the guy
says it to you, to your face. Yeah.

906
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,510
And you know a lot
fucking smarter than you.

907
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,330
It's like one of those
like what did we up for?

908
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,440
What's comments about how they reverse
engineered the red blood cell of a dog

909
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:15,620
and they're doing that with a human red
blood cell and now they're going to take

910
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:19,880
a Nano Bot and two, they're going to copy
it that make it more efficient at what,

911
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,680
what that red blood cell does
and then they'll shoot it in you.

912
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:26,370
It'll be a red blood cell Nano Bot
and that'll that oxygenate your blood.

913
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:30,780
And it's going to literally move on
from there until we're like Wolverine,

914
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:34,200
till we have admin Menttium
skeletons like that's not,

915
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,160
that's not outside the
realm of possibility. We're
meshing with machines do not,

916
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,620
they're probably not going to do
it the way it's in that movie,

917
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,960
but if you think about Wolverine,
the comic book,

918
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:45,540
the whole idea was that
he had these metal bones,

919
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,210
this incredible metal structure,

920
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:53,510
and then on top of that he had skin and
a a body that would heal itself like

921
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,620
instantly. If you caught him, it would
just seal up and you look at it like, oh,

922
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:02,880
that'd be cool. That's calming.
That's 100% it's on the horizon.

923
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,930
If we keep innovating, that is going
to happen. If you can hold your breath,

924
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,770
the bottom of the ocean to four
fucking hours on a single breath,

925
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:11,470
you're going to be,

926
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,860
they're going to be able to figure
out a way to make your skin heal.

927
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,880
Not in a week, not in
a year, not six months,

928
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,240
but in six seconds. Grow skin.
They're going to, they're
going to be able to do it.

929
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,250
Why don't we going to
be able to gene dope?

930
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,770
Like what is this like
the miles and it's common.

931
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:27,180
It's common myostatin inhibitors.

932
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,200
That's what the accidentally have
when they in breed, those dogs,

933
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,510
those whippets and those
cow and those cows.

934
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,480
But they've also started doing
it intentionally to mice.

935
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,290
They had created the mice live longer.
They live long or lose muscle.

936
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,860
Dave giant muscles, they
look like hulk mice. CVO,

937
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,800
pull up a picture of the
hulk mice, Hulk mice, uh,

938
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,480
myostatin inhibitors or so. So when do
I get that? Cause I want to be built.

939
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,730
I want to get into USC.
No, if you, you, you,

940
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,170
your comedy would be fucking horrible.
You know,

941
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:01,360
you always want to be vulnerable up
there. Your style, your whole true.

942
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,240
I have to rewrite your whole life.
I know.

943
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:06,520
I talk about how I'm built for
how I'm built for dance. Not,

944
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:10,020
not for war can bit that you did.
I really enjoyed seeing you. Uh,

945
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:12,450
when Brian and I,
we work together,

946
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:16,260
sometimes we're going to be working
together in Toronto September 19th. Um,

947
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,430
but we, we worked together recently
just just by freak accident.

948
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:25,410
I was in town filming my TV show while
he was working at the Improv in DC.

949
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:29,550
So I came by and got a chance to watch
your said, oh my God, it was so fun.

950
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:34,110
The fucking, the shit of a running through
wheat and we were, me and Todd were,

951
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,650
we were crying,
laughing.

952
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,411
There's nothing,

953
00:55:36,411 --> 00:55:39,460
it's still one of my most satisfying
experiences and as far back as I can

954
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,240
remember,

955
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,240
is listening to you hackle at my jokes
when I was doing standard wash and one of

956
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:49,690
my best friends in the world. There's
nothing more satisfying. I swear to God.

957
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:52,390
I'm not just saying this like,
I was thinking about that,

958
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,650
to be able to make somebody like you,
not only a great comic,

959
00:55:56,651 --> 00:55:57,760
but such a close friend.

960
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:03,060
I was killing you and I could see you
cackling and just loving the stuff that I

961
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:05,680
wrote. You know, it's like I
did this and my, one of my best,

962
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:08,740
like on my brother's out there laughing
his ass off. That's a beautiful feeling,

963
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:11,020
man. I've never, I haven't had a
feeling like that in a long time.

964
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,220
Loved that as well.

965
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:16,410
That's one of the things I love most
about working with guys like Joey

966
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:21,260
[inaudible] and Ari and red band and you
know, Dunkin is that we love each other.

967
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,970
So like if I see the,

968
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,990
you're just fucking howling back there.

969
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,610
Here Diaz is even better
when Diaz is laughing,

970
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:32,230
when I hear him,
I hear him.

971
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:38,110
I had a new bit it last week in Vegas.
We were working together,

972
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:42,610
we did the joint in Vegas and I heard,
I could hear Joey out of 2000 people,

973
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,400
thousand people,

974
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,270
your DHEAS when I was doing this
new bit, he was, yeah man, it's,

975
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,590
it's what we, it's what we were talking
about before about needing support,

976
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:58,690
you know, uh, about like people when they
get through things they need support.

977
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:00,940
And it's also why you need
to learn how to lose things.

978
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,630
You also need to be around
other folks that are,

979
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,430
that are fun and warm and
friendly. And that's, that's big.

980
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,430
And people that you respect
and you look at them and they,

981
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,620
they make you want to like
get your shit together.

982
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:18,040
They make you want to get
things done and if you can,

983
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:21,520
if you can accumulate as many of
those people as you can in your life,

984
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,170
the more you can do that in,
the more you can be.

985
00:57:23,171 --> 00:57:27,220
When those people and more you can
accumulate those people, the more happy,

986
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,260
more enjoyable this thing's
going to be for you.

987
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,950
Yeah. I, you know, um, David plans
to in a new special pretty soon.

988
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,080
What is he going to do? Stand
still for a year? Yeah. No,

989
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:38,890
he's doing job for one year.
Wait till you see I helped him edit his,

990
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,180
this is his tray is a
steel standing still.

991
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,100
Wait till you see what he's doing now.
Six months in.

992
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:48,310
Can You keep it up ladies and
gentlemen of Standing Still? No, no.

993
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:52,160
He's doing magic for the likes of
Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking. Oh,

994
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,550
I tell you what,
you could do a card trick or for the,

995
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:57,430
Stephen is pretty fucking easy. You know
what? He move his, you know what he said?

996
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:05,140
I know. All I know is the dude.
He can't see your fucking sleeves.

997
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:10,120
He sees like a slit, like a
gun, like iron man's eyeballs.

998
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:13,510
That's what he sees. Forward way to
leave. See why he came to my house.

999
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:15,750
He did my podcast. Okay. He comes. No,

1000
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:19,600
a David Blaine and he comes to my house
and I have a couple of my friends.

1001
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:22,330
They're all right. Brandon shoved up
David a couple of days. They're like,

1002
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:25,870
whatever. I stayed with Blaine, he
starts doing magic for them. Okay,

1003
00:58:25,871 --> 00:58:26,890
that's a Douche move.

1004
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,350
That's like you come into someone's
house and start doing your act.

1005
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:33,470
Cause I asked the magazine and I
asked him to, it's even worse now.

1006
00:58:33,471 --> 00:58:35,500
How about someone coming to your
house and you ask him to do jokes?

1007
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,820
That's even worse. He did it.
Listen until you see him do,

1008
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,810
until you see him hold that thought.
Okay,

1009
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,450
well next time he's in like we'll hang
out and I just want you to notice this

1010
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:49,450
conversation. Minds will be blown.
You're going to go, he's magic.

1011
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:51,240
He's really magic.
That's what you're gonna say.

1012
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,460
Just you suggesting that that
could ever happen is exhausting.

1013
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,580
And I am and I'm standing by it.
And,

1014
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,800
and when you're going to do a podcast
and go, Brian was right. Brian is right.

1015
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:03,760
So exhausted. He's a freak. He's magic.
He does magic. Does he do magic? Oh,

1016
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:07,710
but the point I was making is that he
said he was, I was just announced last,

1017
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,640
but he was saying the most important
thing is just surrounding yourself with

1018
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:11,310
people that support
him. I mean, I haven't,

1019
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,170
but everybody I know is successful
always says that sits in one extent.

1020
00:59:14,171 --> 00:59:17,710
You've got to have people around you
that help you go through this shit.

1021
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,290
I don't care how successful you are.
You always go periods where you're lonely.

1022
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,100
Word socks,
where

1023
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,890
you don't think you self doubt.
You gotta have your fucking friends.

1024
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:28,730
How many times have I called you? What?
When you and I have real talks where,

1025
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:32,170
where you know, you, you gotta say
it has all those on file. Now I know.

1026
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,690
How about that? Oh, had that.
Hey Snowden, stay where you are.

1027
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:38,540
Did you see that crazy video,

1028
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:43,160
that MSNBC video where this
woman who is an anchor,

1029
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,210
she's an anchorperson,

1030
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,650
starts like mocking Snowden and
telling him to turn himself in.

1031
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,100
Know it's this,
it's psychologically,

1032
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,680
it's one of the weirdest
things you could ever watch.

1033
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:58,280
It's like you try to look at it and go,
I have not sure what the motivation is.

1034
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:03,050
I have never met a single person that
doesn't think that what he exposed is

1035
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:04,220
important for people to know.

1036
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,840
Not One person people have disagreed
with why he did it or how he did it or,

1037
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,130
or what was done like to compromise
American security if anything,

1038
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,600
but no one and no one thinks that that
wasn't important for people to find out

1039
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:17,810
about it.

1040
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,800
So it's a very subtle and nuanced case
and it's very complicated and it's also

1041
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:25,610
very significant historically because
we know that things are out of control.

1042
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:25,881
Now,

1043
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:29,210
this is not a doubt in the world when
they're looking at every God damn thing

1044
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:32,370
that you're doing, everything that
everybody do. You Walk your photograph to?

1045
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,330
I was in London recently, not
just that graph, 255 times.

1046
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:39,310
The fact that everyone's emails
are being looked at everyone.

1047
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,460
And then this Snowden guy who was just
working there could intercept anyone's

1048
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:43,731
email.

1049
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:47,120
That means other people that are working
for the CIA or the NSA rather could

1050
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:49,670
just intercept your emails so you could,
you know,

1051
01:00:49,671 --> 01:00:52,730
tell people that you're going to go eat
some shit and you know, they go, oh,

1052
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:56,870
Brian cows eating shit. They know
what you're doing. A regular person,

1053
01:00:56,871 --> 01:01:00,410
not a Cyborg, not a monk, not
a person without a motion,

1054
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:03,850
not a person without weirdness
or jealousy or, or uh,

1055
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:09,520
hatred or someone to any one person can
just decide to look at your shit that

1056
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:14,030
works. It's called the tyranny on it. It's
called tyranny. It isn't necessarily a,

1057
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:16,520
nobody's making enough of a fuss about it,
in my opinion.

1058
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,490
That's not the American way. So look at
this woman's reaction. We're going to,

1059
01:01:19,491 --> 01:01:21,560
I'm going to play this shit because
this is going to freak you out.

1060
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,753
I know.

1061
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:27,810
Really important relationships and we're
talking about how you praise countries

1062
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:33,130
like Russia and Venezuela or standing
against human rights violations and with

1063
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,100
using the compromise their
principles. Seriously. Ed,

1064
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:39,400
why do you even come up with
that? What are you thinking? No,

1065
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,380
I understand you don't want to come a bag.

1066
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,810
I mean to do so would mean
giving up your freedom.

1067
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:47,000
Definitely before trial and my thing
for several months, a years thereafter,

1068
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,630
I get it.
It's,

1069
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:53,560
it's an prisons in the u s that
commit actual human rights violations.

1070
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:56,800
We just talked about it more than
more than 80,000 prisoners are held in

1071
01:01:56,801 --> 01:01:58,390
solitary confinement,
some for years,

1072
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:02,080
some indefinitely despite the fact that
solitary is cruel and psychological

1073
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:06,880
damage damaging. I know those aren't
the human rights violations though,

1074
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:08,380
ed,
that you were complaining about,

1075
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,890
but what you might have
nothing to worry about anyway.

1076
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:15,160
Because unlike most of the
people in solitary confinement,

1077
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:19,030
including including private
Bradley Manning on trial,

1078
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:22,590
giving data to Wiki links you've
cultivated for yourself, uh,

1079
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,910
a level of celebrity.

1080
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:29,420
And that celebrity itself may just act
as the protection kind of another kind of

1081
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:32,730
cloak.
If you ever find yourself in a US prison,

1082
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,500
you have made quite a
spectacle of yourself and the
Obama administration will be

1083
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:39,090
very careful about how it treats you.

1084
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,840
Unlike how states treat all those other
prisoners. It's a come on. Oh Med.

1085
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:47,400
Then you know we could
talk about something else.

1086
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,590
Sincerely Melissa.

1087
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,010
Hmm. That's a strange video. First of
all, it's strange that he got greenlit.

1088
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,880
Yeah there's some producer said, I like
it. Let's do it. Let it let it rip.

1089
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,550
We love your copy.
You're really good at reading.

1090
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:05,630
That's like once she's one of the worst
persons they had reading something on

1091
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:07,140
television than I've ever seen.
Right.

1092
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,890
So first of all you can see that she's
got some sort of a speech impediment.

1093
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:12,050
Yeah. But she's struggled
with since she was young,

1094
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:16,880
which probably led her to have this
very strong desire for acceptance,

1095
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:21,230
which probably led her to think that it
would be a good thing to like support

1096
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,960
the government against
Snowden in that video.

1097
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:25,970
I mean I guess that's what she was saying.
I mean it was,

1098
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:28,760
it was a really hard to figure out
what she was saying cause all she was

1099
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:32,180
admitting that the government puts people
in solitary confinement. She was also,

1100
01:03:32,181 --> 01:03:34,520
you know like saying like
where do you get this stuff?

1101
01:03:34,521 --> 01:03:38,370
Like talking about that Venezuela and
Russia stands up for human rights.

1102
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:43,890
Good things about podcasting
for my learning lesson has
been like is how careful

1103
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:46,980
you have to be about saying things
you think you know the answer to.

1104
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:47,770
Isn't that amazing

1105
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,590
that you didn't do that much
and you still are careful

1106
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:58,640
but it's part of talking shit and here's
the fun entertaining shit. Doggies.

1107
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,150
Occasionally you get your facts a
little bit fucked up. All right.

1108
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:04,200
We're not scientists here
fight. I'm trying. My best of me

1109
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,630
that woman was doing was like,
was really like ill advised.

1110
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,820
It was ill advised arrogant.
It's,

1111
01:04:09,821 --> 01:04:13,600
it's a very complicated issue and
the way she's approaching it since,

1112
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:16,720
so we can talk about other things.
Sincerely Melissa, Melissa, Melissa,

1113
01:04:16,721 --> 01:04:19,900
this thing that you don't want to
talk about might be one of the most

1114
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:22,900
significant events in human history.
You know why?

1115
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,170
Because we realize that there's
no such thing as privacy.

1116
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,210
I don't know if that's
sunk in with everybody yet,

1117
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:31,960
but it really is very close.
I mean,

1118
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:34,900
right now it's in the government's hands
and that will eventually trickle down

1119
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:35,570
to the people.

1120
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:38,690
I think it's a huge problem. I
think. I think the fact that I never,

1121
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:43,670
that I'm always being watched by a video
camera somewhere is video cameras are

1122
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,670
one thing. But Monitoring,
monitoring my emails,

1123
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,910
you guys don't tell me that you're doing
that. You don't need a, you don't need a,

1124
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:54,380
um, a warrant. That's insane.
That's not, that's not it, right?

1125
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:58,640
It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.
And by the way, everybody, sorry to say,

1126
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:01,910
by the way again, but remember
that every, every dictatorship,

1127
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:07,210
every single oppressive government in
history has always used national security,

1128
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:12,230
uh, as an excuse to take your freedoms
away. That's always the excuse, isn't it?

1129
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,270
Look at history.
It's always,

1130
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:18,160
it's a dangerous world and we're
here to protect you. Nah, no thanks.

1131
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:22,540
Don't trust you. What's a classic thing
to do to actually pump up an enemy,

1132
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,310
to get them to become a threat?
So that you can go and attack them.

1133
01:05:25,311 --> 01:05:28,720
That's your reason to keep the war
machine going. That's right. Yeah. It's,

1134
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:29,860
and you know what,
man?

1135
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:34,150
That's what happens when you get people
that make money off of war and that's

1136
01:05:34,151 --> 01:05:38,260
what it's supposed to be. A bunch of laws
in place to keep that from happening.

1137
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:38,621
You know?

1138
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:41,860
That's why Eisenhower gone on television
and warned about the dangers of the

1139
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:44,140
military industrial complex
when he was leaving office.

1140
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,840
All of that exists because it's,

1141
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:51,190
it's just like with corporations
do to other countries. You know,

1142
01:05:51,191 --> 01:05:52,360
if you're a good person,

1143
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:56,290
you wouldn't go to Venezuela and steal
their oil and pollute the rivers.

1144
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,820
You wouldn't do it.
Okay.

1145
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:01,280
You wouldn't do it because you would see
the people cry and see people starve to

1146
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:04,570
death and see the fish die and you'd
go, wow, what I'm doing is fucked up.

1147
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:09,250
But if you're some evil chemical company
and the way to make money is to do

1148
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:13,330
that, and you have stockholders and you
have all these people that are putting

1149
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:16,350
pressure on you,
that doesn't answer the equation so much.

1150
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,630
One of those leather chairs
that has those, those rivets,

1151
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:23,500
those brass rivets like dug deep into
it like an a million different places.

1152
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:28,501
Those puffy leather chairs where they
always have like some brandy on a shelf,

1153
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:33,700
you know with some glasses and a tub
of ice that they clink clink as they're

1154
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:38,250
pouring a drink. Talk, listen, we have a
bottom line and I'm not going to Ecuador.

1155
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,400
You going to Ecuador, so fuck the river.
Fuck that river. Let's get that money.

1156
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:44,290
And they just somehow or another,

1157
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:49,090
even if it's not the decision that I
made in that sort of a fashion of an x

1158
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:49,601
amount of people,

1159
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:53,590
whether it's 4,000 or 400 how many people
were in that corporation decided to

1160
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:58,591
act as an evil unit and decide to do some
fucked up shit to make that money nor

1161
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:04,090
an inconvenient truth. Sure. And then
if they can do that, they can also,

1162
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:09,150
they'll seem sort of those same
principles of action apply.

1163
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,620
That's how war happens in the first place.

1164
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:16,510
You can get a giant army of people to
behave like psychos as long as the people

1165
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:18,870
around them are also behaving
like psychos. That's,

1166
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,650
it just becomes your new reality.
People go to war that that's,

1167
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,630
if you look at how people
are motivated to go to war,

1168
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:28,900
a lot of times they are motivated
around symbols, around slogans,

1169
01:07:28,901 --> 01:07:31,630
around different kinds of propaganda.
That's always been the case.

1170
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,950
That's been the case since the,
you know, the Trojan war. Uh,

1171
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:39,460
and that that's it's, it's
a characteristics of human
beings that you have to,

1172
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,310
if you're looking at human
beings as a set of ingredients,

1173
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,000
what does this thing like? Okay. Say if
you have a car, you have a, you know,

1174
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:49,780
you have a Mercedes Benz.
It's a 1996.

1175
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,450
How many horsepower does it have? What's
a capable of doing? You know, how,

1176
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,360
how quickly can stop from zero to 60.
What are the possibilities of this,

1177
01:07:57,361 --> 01:08:01,690
this unit? Well, human beings are
just like a car in that sense.

1178
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:06,310
Like we have a lot of possibilities
as far as documented behavior that's

1179
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:10,840
completely outside the norm. It's not
giant spectrum from killing babies.

1180
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,180
To helping old people across the
street and planting flowers everywhere.

1181
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,980
Whole rape w well there's just

1182
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,250
so much going on inside the,
the possibility drawer.

1183
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,850
If you open up the possibility
drawer of human beings like, Ooh,

1184
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,380
you better sit down cause this is
mother fuckers came above a la shit.

1185
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:31,670
Incredible cruelty. Incredible kindness.
You know? So everything in between. Yeah.

1186
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:35,510
So when you lump them all together
without personal accountability,

1187
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:39,380
you're going to open up the
potential for all this craziness,

1188
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:44,410
all the worst aspects of human beings
when they don't have a direct action

1189
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:46,470
reaction input.
That's when the people that are,

1190
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,830
when there's no accountability and
hide behind a huge institution.

1191
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:54,560
It is. And it's almost not
even about hiding behind it.

1192
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:57,500
It's almost not even about
not having any accountability.

1193
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:01,730
It's a matter of not feeling it.
Whatever you're doing,

1194
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:02,900
you're not feeling this.

1195
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:06,320
One is the reasons why people can
go fuck you to someone in their car.

1196
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:07,640
You can drive in the fuck you,

1197
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,100
but it was on the street and
that guy was that close to you.

1198
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:13,070
You wouldn't say fuck you to him.
I wouldn't stick your finger at him.

1199
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:15,670
You would have to be crazy
because you've got to read,

1200
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,160
you've got to respond to that person
in front of your, you're interacting.

1201
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:21,890
There's that. Malcolm Gladwell did that
amazing study about how murder rate,

1202
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,290
the murder rate went
up when they built it.

1203
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:28,850
They had to ghettos and after they
built those huge, huge projects,

1204
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:31,360
all of a sudden you didn't leave the next,

1205
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,730
the guy you lived in and the guy lived
in a unit above you and there was

1206
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:38,270
anonymity created so you could still
shoot somebody for their shoes cause you

1207
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:40,460
didn't know them. You didn't know
somebody who was connected to them.

1208
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:43,040
You didn't know that the
fabric that they came from,

1209
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:46,430
it used to be windows stack
in the car in the Bronx. When,

1210
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:47,990
when all of those communities came up,

1211
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:52,580
they came up around a barter system
around an economic system that kind of

1212
01:09:52,581 --> 01:09:56,960
happened organically when they put the
cross Bronx expressway in there and they

1213
01:09:56,961 --> 01:09:59,600
tore everything down and they
said, you know, we're going to do,

1214
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:01,460
we're going to plan the Bronx on a board,

1215
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,820
and they plan on a board
and they had these big ha,

1216
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:07,310
they created these big projects. Let's
just put them all in these big buildings.

1217
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:10,020
All of a sudden the murder
rate went up and one of the,

1218
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,740
one of the theories is the fact that you,
and suddenly now,

1219
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:16,580
because even if you were in a ghetto,
you knew that kid's grandmother,

1220
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:19,160
you knew that kid's brother. You didn't,
there was always, everybody was connected,

1221
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:23,330
right? You all knew each other. The
minute you put people in those buildings,

1222
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,380
now they're living in boxes and
he's living on a fifth floor.

1223
01:10:27,381 --> 01:10:30,230
You live in on the first floor or whatever
and you don't have an interaction.

1224
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,490
There was no, the economic fabric
of that community was destroyed. So,

1225
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,360
so it became much easier to shoot somebody
you didn't know somebody new in your,

1226
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:41,060
in your close proximity and don't
have a relationship with them.

1227
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:44,120
And they're right on top of exactly,
which is very unnatural for humans.

1228
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:46,130
And this is where I always say that,
you know,

1229
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:49,400
if you think you can walk around and
being, be being ignorant in today's world,

1230
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,490
you're wrong about that.
Political commitment is important.

1231
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:54,430
And knowing why you believe something.
And the,

1232
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,090
this is a classic example
in my opinion of, of uh,

1233
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,300
a threat that is very insidious.
It's not obvious right now.

1234
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,660
It may not be obvious, but that's why
the Snowden case is very important.

1235
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:08,840
It's important to, to at least
you don't have to have an opinion.

1236
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:13,440
Just familiarize yourself, familiarize
yourself with how these things happen.

1237
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,100
History

1238
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,600
repeats itself. No, that your freedom
can be taken away from you in 2013.

1239
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:22,140
April 10. And she is being taken
away in this country. Well, you know,

1240
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:26,310
and there was a painless, no one's
doing anything. My freedom just relax.

1241
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:27,900
Stop getting crazy right.

1242
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:33,650
Instead of looking at it in any way
that connects you to it personally.

1243
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,020
Whether you're defending it or whether
you're, you know, you're, you're,

1244
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:41,280
you're violently opposed to it.
Look at it as a trend,

1245
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:42,900
as a human trend.

1246
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:46,860
And then it becomes fascinating because
if you take yourself outside of it and

1247
01:11:46,861 --> 01:11:50,190
you, you go, instead of going, we
have to stop this corrupt government.

1248
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:53,490
Just look at it like step back and
look, look, look at what's happening.

1249
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:56,850
Like what is this? What
is this? What is this?

1250
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:00,650
This is a strange little thing happened
and here's a convergence. But why,

1251
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:05,310
why am I know Cam a soft
crimes? I know cameras do a
lot of good things. Good, but,

1252
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,680
but you have to add the plan. We keep
bringing up the camera, but they're,

1253
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:12,170
they're everywhere. I'm not I, and by the
way, I feel safer sometimes cause yeah,

1254
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,910
I'm sure it has.
It has a positive effect.

1255
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:19,370
But to what degree are we talking about
what, what, what is the tradeoff and,

1256
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:23,100
and who is,
who is saying enough is enough?

1257
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,850
Where is the check and balance? That's
what I want. It doesn't exist. Okay,

1258
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:28,860
well that's, that's a problem.
Not only does it not exist,

1259
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:33,000
it can't exist if you'd follow
the pattern of human behavior.

1260
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:37,740
It's like when rich people got
cell phones, do you remember that?

1261
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,470
It was a long ass time ago,
1980s and nineties.

1262
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:43,800
The like only rich people have phones
and you would occasionally seen a phone

1263
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:48,570
and it was like a cool thing. I
remember uh, this comic looked into, um,

1264
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,980
you know Jackie Flynn. Yeah. Funny
Guy. I Love Jack. Jackie, uh, is,

1265
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:56,910
he's always had like a couple bucks is
families successful business and he was

1266
01:12:56,911 --> 01:12:59,010
always a part of that and
he had a real nice car.

1267
01:12:59,011 --> 01:13:02,310
He had a Toyota supra and another
comic looked in the window and he said,

1268
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:05,070
oh I love the way that phone looks.
Cause he had a phone in his car.

1269
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:07,430
I was like 1989 or something like that.
Nobody had,

1270
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:10,950
Jackie plays a mean game
of golf to, at her. Yeah.

1271
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:13,970
He's got this phone in his car
and it was like, Whoa, whoa.

1272
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,140
Which people can have
phones in their cars.

1273
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,590
Not Everybody has a fucking phone in
their pocket that they carry around with

1274
01:13:19,591 --> 01:13:21,690
them everywhere.
Eventually it got so far,

1275
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:26,100
I was in Brazil and I saw these people
in this very poor neighborhood and they

1276
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,470
all had phones. They're on their
phones or talking on phones.

1277
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:33,770
It's like it's become so worldwide and
in world spread and right now information

1278
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,230
is freely accessible only to the people
in the highest points of government.

1279
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,390
Right now it's only the people in the NSA,

1280
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:47,391
the people that have made these shitty
inside deals with Internet providers and

1281
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:51,790
have gotten access to phone calls and
records and text messages and shit. They,

1282
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:54,480
it's only them,
but that's just a trend.

1283
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:58,350
It's going to start with them and then
the technology is slowly but surely going

1284
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,660
to be available to everybody.
That might be a good thing, right?

1285
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:01,680
It might be a good thing,

1286
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,010
but it's going to be a different
thing and here's a problem. Money,

1287
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,490
because money right now
is just ones and Zeros.

1288
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:11,070
Money right now is just confidence.
It's just information.

1289
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,990
It doesn't exist anymore. There's no like,
I mean you can have $1 million. Exactly.

1290
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:18,430
It's not a goal. It's not like you have a
stack of gold, like you have $1 million.

1291
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:21,180
So if you go to that bank, those
million notes, you can turn them in,

1292
01:14:21,181 --> 01:14:24,430
they'll give you a million, you
know, x amount of pounds of gold,

1293
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:28,210
that equals $1 million and it doesn't
exist anymore. So if it doesn't exist,

1294
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:31,540
what is it made out of? What's made
out of ones and Zeros? It's all it is.

1295
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:36,070
It's made it a confidence in ones and
Zeros and the rest of it is just woven

1296
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:39,580
into this complicated system that's
called our financial structure.

1297
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:43,590
But if you looked at that
objectively, you go, well, yeah,

1298
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,670
we have a very complicated system.
There's no need to worry.

1299
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:47,520
Like you stop and you go,
what are you talking about?

1300
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,170
You have a bunch of
computers and ones and Zeros.

1301
01:14:50,171 --> 01:14:53,290
You don't have a real money that
you don't have a real substance.

1302
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:58,380
So my point is that I have a theory that
as information becomes more and more

1303
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:01,390
freely distributed, it's going
to, it's going to happen.

1304
01:15:01,391 --> 01:15:02,980
It's going to get to a point
where there's no boundaries.

1305
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,050
There's no boundaries between thoughts.

1306
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,910
Everyone's going to be able
to read each other's minds.

1307
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:10,090
You're all gonna be able to communicate
through Wifi and you're all going to

1308
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:11,860
know everything that everybody else knows.

1309
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:13,960
You're not just going to
know what you tell me.

1310
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:15,550
I'm going to know what's
going on in your mind.

1311
01:15:15,551 --> 01:15:19,180
I'm going to know what you can remember
the central neural net and we're going

1312
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,960
to be able to create artificial
recording of memories.

1313
01:15:22,961 --> 01:15:26,980
It's far more accurate than the shitty
memories we carry around in our brain and

1314
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,060
when that happens,

1315
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,210
you're going to have access to mind and
I'm going to have access to yours and

1316
01:15:31,211 --> 01:15:34,210
it's going to be a requirement eventually
that everybody has some sort of a

1317
01:15:34,211 --> 01:15:36,940
neuro recorder cause people are
gonna want to know what you're doing.

1318
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:39,340
They're go want to have full
access to your thoughts and idea.

1319
01:15:39,341 --> 01:15:41,710
We're going to be able to
solve all the crimes instantly.

1320
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:42,910
That's going to be the answer to it.

1321
01:15:42,911 --> 01:15:45,010
They're going to say there's
going to be 100% accountability.

1322
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,710
No one will ever get away with a crime
again because we're all going to know

1323
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:51,250
exactly what everybody does when they
do it. So we're all going to sign up.

1324
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,620
What's that say about privacy?
There's going to be none,

1325
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:56,740
but the point by point is
money's going to go that way too.

1326
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:58,560
There's going to be no money anymore.
It's gonna,

1327
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:01,510
it's gonna reach the point where
it's just resources and it's just,

1328
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,690
there has to be some sort of a fair
system as far as the distribution of

1329
01:16:04,691 --> 01:16:05,524
resources.

1330
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:07,870
But the idea that you're going to keep
them in a bank and get them out with a

1331
01:16:07,871 --> 01:16:11,320
card, good fucking lie.
It's ones and Zeros, man.

1332
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:15,250
It doesn't mean it's not
gonna mean anything when
everyone can get access to it.

1333
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,970
They've already figured out a way.
Um,

1334
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:21,280
they're on the preliminary stages
where they can, they can map, they can,

1335
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,510
I guess you,

1336
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,900
they show you an image and then they
look at your brain activity when you see

1337
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:30,670
that image. And then when you, they
show you the image again, they,

1338
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:34,930
the brain activity in it shows
up on the same kind of pattern.

1339
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:37,240
So you recognize something
and they can tell.

1340
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,230
So what the idea is that if
you rob the bank or you are in,

1341
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:44,640
you are a criminal and you
were in a certain place and
they give you uh, the, and,

1342
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:48,580
and they, they show you that
place and they scan your brain.

1343
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:49,931
When they tell,

1344
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:54,430
when they tell you about the place and
your brain registers a certain thing,

1345
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:58,370
they can show you a picture of it.
If your brain registers that image again,

1346
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,190
the same kind of brain activity,

1347
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,620
they can tell whether you've
actually seen it before.

1348
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,800
It was this weird kind of idea, you
know, so we're getting closer and closer.

1349
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:07,960
But when you say a Zeros and ones,

1350
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,750
you're talking about money
no longer being real. Uh,

1351
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:14,810
this guy named James Rickards who wrote
a book called currency wars did my

1352
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:15,530
podcast,

1353
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:20,530
the Pentagon hired him
to stage a currency war.

1354
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:22,941
Uh,
so,

1355
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:27,320
so simulate what's something someone like
China could do to our currency system

1356
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:32,700
and because it's all computerized and
it's all sort of ones and Zeros, he,

1357
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:37,720
he basically was hired by the Pentagon
to come up with a scenario whereby the

1358
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:43,031
Chinese could set up say 10 fake
hedge fund companies that ended up,

1359
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,253
you know,

1360
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:49,730
doing something to buying all this
stock or buying just up a bunch of and

1361
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,130
getting the market to crash.
It'd be a very difficult thing to do.

1362
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:54,260
But that was his job.
It was pretty fascinating,

1363
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:57,020
would be with the idea where where
there is no real money you can really

1364
01:17:57,021 --> 01:17:58,730
manipulate with through computers,

1365
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:03,710
sort of an entire segment of the
economy and recap it theoretically,

1366
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:04,280
you know,

1367
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,800
and that's something the Pentagon hires
people that try to do in stimulate.

1368
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,490
But it was really, really an interesting
kind of concept. Well if you,

1369
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:13,280
if your money is based on a computer,

1370
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,850
I mean it's based on calculations.
You can protect it,

1371
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,550
you can put up firewalls and you can do,

1372
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:24,350
but essentially it's just as vulnerable
as a computer is. And that's what,

1373
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,190
you know,

1374
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:28,520
one of the things about the financial
system that I've found to be terrifying

1375
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:33,680
when I found out that stocks can be traded
by bots and that they could recognize

1376
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,380
trends and trade like second to second,

1377
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:41,570
like do these split second analysis of
trends and constantly keep earning money

1378
01:18:41,571 --> 01:18:45,260
that way by exploiting the system and
understanding which way things are moving

1379
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:46,190
and buying and selling.

1380
01:18:46,191 --> 01:18:50,660
So you just chipping away at
the block every couple seconds,

1381
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:52,550
making a little bit here
and a little bit there,

1382
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:55,100
but taking essentially very little risks.

1383
01:18:55,340 --> 01:19:00,340
And by doing that they can figure out a
way to just extract money through a Bot

1384
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:05,920
and that this is legal and that this
is it. This is how people use the stop.

1385
01:19:05,921 --> 01:19:10,190
You take a spread, you mean?
Or they figure out which
way things are going. Right.

1386
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:13,130
And the, by the way, the
Bot, by the way, by the way,

1387
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:18,320
the bots can do calculations and an
input trades faster than a person can.

1388
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,480
Yeah. And they're, you know,

1389
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:22,490
they're connected to whatever the fuck
our financial system is. I mean, I,

1390
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,600
when I see the Dow and I see those fucking
numbers scrolling through the bottom,

1391
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:31,370
to me that looks like a close encounters
of the third kind inside of the

1392
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:33,770
spaceship. Like if they had
the inside of the patient,

1393
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:37,090
when they show the alien language
to me, Bro, it's Greek to me. It's,

1394
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:41,000
but it's Greek to everyone. Even if they
understand it, it's still in sanity. It's,

1395
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,690
it's, I shouldn't say Greek,
but yeah. In a way, look,

1396
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:46,760
grace is fucking bankrupt right now.
You know,

1397
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,520
how crazy is it that at one point in time,

1398
01:19:49,521 --> 01:19:52,730
the greatest culture on the planet earth,

1399
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:57,731
the most knowledgeable and that full field
was scholars creating beautiful works

1400
01:19:58,071 --> 01:20:03,071
of architecture and stuff that people
still read today still inspired by today.

1401
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:06,200
You know, some of the great
Greek masters and then today,

1402
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,490
what is going on over there now?
Nothing.

1403
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,060
The fucking whole thing's falling apart
is Detroit, is Detroit, the country,

1404
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:14,490
there's no money there.
It's a fucking wreck.

1405
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,290
The whole thing is going bankrupt is
80% unemployment rate or something crazy

1406
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:23,400
like that. It's just bananas. The
whole thing's a fucking disaster. Yeah,

1407
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,270
that's right. Like these civilizations
can hit these insane heights,

1408
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,070
but then come Trump crumbling down

1409
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:32,230
Greece is a good example of what
we're talking about. You know,

1410
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,840
you're talking about trends. There's
also something called a tipping point.

1411
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:39,070
Shit happens. Start. Things start
happening. If you don't pay attention,

1412
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:41,350
things will cascade in a moment.

1413
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:44,410
So nobody didn't grease
thought that their,

1414
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:47,650
their system was going to
collapse until it was too late.

1415
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:52,090
And I say that's the same thing
that can happen with your freedoms.

1416
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,690
I think that's the same thing if
you're not careful, if you don't know,

1417
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:59,410
if you don't, if you're not paying
attention to who the the real enemy is,

1418
01:20:59,411 --> 01:21:02,380
or at least you don't make enough noise
or you're not paying attention to what's

1419
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:05,260
going on. That's, that's the
kind of stuff that can happen.

1420
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:09,180
Well, it's also individuals, again,
looking out for themselves, trying to,

1421
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:13,800
trying to extract money. It's individuals
exploring a system of shitty system.

1422
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:16,170
Sure. Individuals exploring
it. I mean the whole,

1423
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:18,930
the housing market in this country for
the people that don't understand it,

1424
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:22,890
which is by the way everybody, by the
way, by the way, nobody understands it.

1425
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,060
That's how it happened.
And you know,

1426
01:21:24,061 --> 01:21:27,390
you can sort of be armchair
quarterback and you know,

1427
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:31,800
you could sit back Monday morning and
sort of second guess the decisions that

1428
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:36,280
were made. But the reality is it's sort
of exposed that the whole thing is,

1429
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,200
is horse shit.

1430
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:41,490
And the reason why it was horse shit
was because the way it was set up,

1431
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,690
even though it didn't last,

1432
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:45,660
was a bunch of people were able to
extract insane amounts of money.

1433
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:49,000
That made no sense even though it
didn't make any sense. Fascinating.

1434
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,890
Well you should, you, you did you sell
the house, you sold the house. Right?

1435
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,320
Did you make a shit load of money
on it? That makes no sense. Yeah.

1436
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:59,550
I sold the house in the early
two thousands and I made,

1437
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:03,930
I doubled the price of my house
in like a couple of years.

1438
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:07,260
That's ridiculous.
There's no way that should have happened.

1439
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:08,760
I didn't do anything to that house.

1440
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:13,761
I mean I fixed a few things but I didn't
like completely redo it or anything

1441
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:14,881
like that.

1442
01:22:14,881 --> 01:22:19,881
And yet the housing prices went up so
high that I could get 100% more than what

1443
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:20,760
I paid.

1444
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,210
There's a book called the big short by
Michael Lewis and he basically traces how

1445
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:24,841
this all happened.

1446
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:29,040
And there was really two people
according to him in this book and if I'm

1447
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:31,020
remembering might've been one,
there are really two people,

1448
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:35,670
one of whom Ha was has aspergers
syndrome, he was in San Jose, California,

1449
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:39,950
had a lazy eye and was a true
Asberger's syndrome. And,

1450
01:22:39,951 --> 01:22:44,190
and basically six years before this
was looking at these mortgage backed

1451
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:45,770
securities,
these tronches and,

1452
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:49,380
and actually breaking them down cause he
was obsessed with numbers and actually

1453
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:51,630
really knew how they worked,
how derivatives and everything worked.

1454
01:22:51,631 --> 01:22:53,580
And he was going,
oh wait a minute,

1455
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:59,300
these houses and these algorithms aren't
reflecting real value and this isn't

1456
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,720
making sense yet.

1457
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:03,960
They're sponging these mortgage
backed securities and selling them.

1458
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:07,260
And I don't think people that can
be able to pay their mortgages,

1459
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:09,790
this isn't making sense.
And he was saying that six,

1460
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:12,430
seven years before that
and figured it out.

1461
01:23:12,431 --> 01:23:14,980
And then there was another
guy who is this dude who just,

1462
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,810
who was a broker who did this,

1463
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,320
who I think hooked up with this guy and
started looking at it and he was like,

1464
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:24,190
ew, this doesn't make any sense. This
whole system is going to collapse.

1465
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:28,330
They were literally like trying to build
Noah's Ark and it's a great book called

1466
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:29,410
the big short and he,

1467
01:23:29,411 --> 01:23:33,910
and he really does a great job of actually
showing the key players who really

1468
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:38,320
saw this thing coming and were jumping
up and down and they were ridiculed for

1469
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:41,680
it. Yes, I did. I saw it. If you like
inside job, read the big short cause.

1470
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:44,980
It's amazing. If you don't
like to read, watch inside job,

1471
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,730
you're not in because it's amazing
and the Guy Confronts people,

1472
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:51,970
he confronts all these.
It turns out not only was,

1473
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,860
I mean inside job was really an apt name
for it because not only was it a crazy

1474
01:23:56,861 --> 01:24:01,861
fucked up system that people
were exploiting the people
that were passing their

1475
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:04,840
judgment and saying,
what is acceptable?

1476
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:09,841
What's not acceptable would eventually
get hired by these big banking companies.

1477
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:12,760
So what they would do is they would be
professors at Harvard and they would be

1478
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:16,000
economics professors and
they would analyze all these
trends and they would like,

1479
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,970
well, our recommendation is that this is
good and this is as good as that. And,

1480
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:19,361
and we'll,

1481
01:24:19,361 --> 01:24:23,500
all they were doing was giving people
the green light to extract money and then

1482
01:24:23,501 --> 01:24:27,010
they would go work for those people
and get these insane fucking jobs.

1483
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:29,230
So the SEC,
incredible if the FCC,

1484
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:34,150
and so they looked at the trend of
people like going from, you know,

1485
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:39,070
like from Harvard to the sec and the sec
to some insane job where they would get

1486
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:43,870
fucking kazillions dogs here. And they'd
go, oh, oh, they just, everyone's corrupt.

1487
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,580
The whole thing is corrupt.
It's a coop.

1488
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:49,390
And when this guy's like confronting
these people and that movie inside job and

1489
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:54,100
they're like freaking out and reacting
to him, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing.

1490
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:55,950
It's pretty amazing.
Great. Great document.

1491
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,700
And it will make you want
to throw a hammer through
fucking TV and we'll get you

1492
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:00,371
back question.

1493
01:25:00,371 --> 01:25:04,810
It raises though is is that
is the incentive structure
that was set up to blame

1494
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,700
and how do you avoid,

1495
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:09,790
because smart people are going to take
advantage of a system that's broken.

1496
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,360
So how then do you see a you,

1497
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,650
we all know that you're never
going to control human behavior.

1498
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:17,020
I mean it's going to be impossible.
And when people see an opening,

1499
01:25:17,021 --> 01:25:18,190
they're going to take it some people.

1500
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:23,460
So the idea then is how do you create a
system that doesn't reward that kind of

1501
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:28,240
behavior that seems to shout
even possible. One of the,

1502
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:30,670
one of the ways that smart
people will talk about is to say,

1503
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,850
you still have this guy, James
Rickards, who was, um, on my show,

1504
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:36,400
said the problem with too big to fail,

1505
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:40,180
the eight biggest banks in the
country are, are bigger than ever.

1506
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:44,890
And what that means is that the u
s government can't let them fail.

1507
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:48,610
They can behave very irresponsibly.
I'm not saying they are right now,

1508
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:52,300
but they can if they wanted to behave
very irresponsibly and they, and if they,

1509
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,740
if they screw up again,

1510
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:57,850
we have to bail him out because they
are the central nervous system of our

1511
01:25:57,851 --> 01:25:59,290
financial structure.

1512
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:04,070
But the crazy thing is that it was all
warned about a long ass ago. The idea

1513
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:08,220
of a bank being too big to
fail is it's a refuted premise.

1514
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,810
Nothing's happened about, doesn't work,
nothing's happened about it. No nothing,

1515
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,880
nothing has happened.
Not In worse in some way.

1516
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:17,690
And what was my favorite part about it
was when they were talking about the

1517
01:26:17,691 --> 01:26:22,220
bonuses and that Obama was going to limit
them to the $500,000 because guys were

1518
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:25,970
still getting bonuses like millions and
millions of dollars and they're like,

1519
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:27,470
well they have to pay
them because they don't.

1520
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:30,680
These guys are going to go
work for someone else. And
I remember thinking like,

1521
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:33,620
where are they going to work? They're
going to work for who? How much money?

1522
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:37,370
How could you possibly get a
bonus when your bank is folding?

1523
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,050
Like what is the bonus food?

1524
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,170
The answer to that. If you listen,
a lot of people as they go,

1525
01:26:41,171 --> 01:26:43,510
guess what banks do it. They don't live
in a capitalist society. First of all,

1526
01:26:43,511 --> 01:26:44,950
they call Obama a socialist.
They're the,

1527
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:47,530
they're the biggest socialist and
the planet. They have socialized,

1528
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,660
there are losses and privatized their
gains. You lose. Don't worry, the bank,

1529
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:54,730
the governor bail you out big to fail.
Buddy went out there with that.

1530
01:26:54,731 --> 01:26:57,050
You guys talk about being capitalist.
You guys went out there with you.

1531
01:26:57,150 --> 01:27:01,390
Well we failed. Somebody bails
out but you, you privatized,
you make all the money.

1532
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:04,410
You live in a private economy.
You your talk about the, the,

1533
01:27:04,411 --> 01:27:07,300
the market system and the
free market enterprise

1534
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,620
bitching about this stop for a
second and what would you do?

1535
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:13,710
What would I do? What would
you do? I'm getting him.

1536
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:16,250
You're going to give me the king of
the world. I'm going to allow you,

1537
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:17,103
you unlimited.

1538
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:21,120
First thing I would say, first thing I
would do is this campaign finance reform.

1539
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,900
What does that mean? Take money
out of politics. Why in the world?

1540
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:27,060
Why in the world and, and, and again,

1541
01:27:27,061 --> 01:27:29,130
I'm sorry to bring up another
book but don't go to a book,

1542
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:33,900
go to the Ted Lecture and, and listen
to, um, uh, it's called, uh, uh,

1543
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:38,730
republic lost by Lawrence Lessig and,
and basically here's how it goes.

1544
01:27:38,731 --> 01:27:40,320
If you're a politician in this country,

1545
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:45,570
you are beholden to fundraisers.
You spend all your time,

1546
01:27:45,571 --> 01:27:48,240
40% of your time calling people you
don't know for money cause you're not

1547
01:27:48,241 --> 01:27:51,090
getting elected otherwise.
How do you solve that problem?

1548
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,240
Take money out of politics.
There are ways to do it. I,

1549
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,030
I'm not gonna sit here and tell you
how there are ways to do it where money

1550
01:27:57,031 --> 01:28:00,570
doesn't play a big as big enough role
because now we are in an economy of

1551
01:28:00,571 --> 01:28:01,404
influence.

1552
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:06,300
You cannot do business as a private
corporation without having a pipeline to

1553
01:28:06,301 --> 01:28:07,860
Washington.
You can't,

1554
01:28:07,861 --> 01:28:11,910
it takes two hours to get into
Washington cause it 13,000 lobbyists are

1555
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:15,750
descending on that, on that capital
every fucking day. Okay, so,

1556
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:20,910
so as long as you create an economy of
influence and you have corporations that

1557
01:28:20,911 --> 01:28:24,980
are manipulating that massive structure,
what do you think it started there?

1558
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:29,820
Do you think the solution is the
Internet? Well, that's my second thing.

1559
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:31,171
The the,

1560
01:28:31,171 --> 01:28:34,710
there is an America that works and
that America that works is the kind of

1561
01:28:34,711 --> 01:28:39,450
commerce that is going on on the Internet,
Ebay and all this other stuff and,

1562
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:42,570
and the government hasn't yet gotten
involved. That's still a wild frontier.

1563
01:28:42,571 --> 01:28:47,070
And guess what? Guess what? You and
I, regular people know how to do it.

1564
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:50,850
We don't need a bunch of licenses
and government intervention people.

1565
01:28:50,851 --> 01:28:53,790
The Internet works. It's also works. You

1566
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:57,810
can't have a bunch of things that are
going to influence all of us happening

1567
01:28:57,811 --> 01:29:00,990
behind closed doors. You just
can't. Of course not. You can't.

1568
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:04,080
You're talking about the NSA now.
People need to know,

1569
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:07,680
like if there's environmental issues
that are coming up and they're being

1570
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:12,000
debated inside some closed door where
people are making deals and those, those,

1571
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:16,410
those decisions that they're making
could fuck us all up. Those, they can't,

1572
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,470
that can't happen.
No one should have that ability.

1573
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,210
No one should have that kind of power.

1574
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:26,180
She had a caveat though very quickly to
that there is something called secret

1575
01:29:26,181 --> 01:29:28,660
deliberation. There's nothing
wrong with it and I've finished,

1576
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:30,730
let me finish with this
sentence. When, when,

1577
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:33,650
like if you look at the Supreme Court,
when they did,

1578
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,020
when they come to a decision they had,

1579
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,710
they were trying to a room and it is a
secret sort of deliberation that media is

1580
01:29:39,711 --> 01:29:42,890
not there because it requires
lots of sober thought.

1581
01:29:42,891 --> 01:29:44,420
It requires changing your mind.

1582
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:47,540
You can't have people listening
and watching the process however,

1583
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:51,440
however different things it is because,
because the decision exactly.

1584
01:29:51,441 --> 01:29:56,441
Cause this decision finally is a public
decision that still has to be that,

1585
01:29:56,481 --> 01:29:58,910
that that that we contend with them.
We know about,

1586
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:02,300
well not only that,
but when someone is in the Supreme Court,

1587
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:06,950
the theoretically at least they have the
responsibility to adhere to the letter

1588
01:30:06,951 --> 01:30:10,010
of the law and anyone influencing that,

1589
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:14,720
anyone outside of the supreme court
influencing that would be negative.

1590
01:30:14,721 --> 01:30:17,220
So if it was wide open to the
whole world to look at it,

1591
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:20,720
then you've got all these people
influencing it and react to it and their

1592
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:25,460
influence may affect that decision
gets made, but it's been hijacked.

1593
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:28,610
Of course, it's been hijacked
so it, it did do get influenced.

1594
01:30:28,611 --> 01:30:32,900
When you hear the Supreme Court passed
shit that says like a corporation can act

1595
01:30:32,901 --> 01:30:37,520
as an individual and they can donate as
much money as they want to a campaign.

1596
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:41,450
When you have those kinds of decisions
being made, you go, oh they got, yeah,

1597
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:42,230
they got to you.

1598
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:46,980
If there's widespread spying
on, on its citizens, if,

1599
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:50,630
if a government is spying
on its citizenry secretly,

1600
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,870
if they are collecting information
from right, ordinary citizens,

1601
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:58,010
I want to know about it.
Let's have the debate publicly.

1602
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:01,190
Tell me if it's really that
important to stop terrorism.

1603
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:02,990
Can we have a public debate?

1604
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:06,470
I want to know about what's going to
happen that Snowden and dude that's going

1605
01:31:06,471 --> 01:31:06,890
to be here.

1606
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:09,560
He's going to stay in Russia because we
don't have an extradition treaty with

1607
01:31:09,561 --> 01:31:12,140
them. Well, if he's smart,
he would stay in Russia.

1608
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,850
I don't think the dude should come back.
That's for fuck shore.

1609
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,300
I don't think you should come back.
I never should be a debate.

1610
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:21,800
I just think there should be a debate,

1611
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,940
a real debate about what the hell
is going on with the NSA and, and,

1612
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:29,150
and how we navigate this problem.

1613
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:32,240
But meanwhile they're trying to
not talk about it. Like, you know,

1614
01:31:32,241 --> 01:31:33,310
everyone was talking about the,

1615
01:31:33,311 --> 01:31:36,860
the new royal baby and everyone's talking
about Andrew Wiener within his cock

1616
01:31:36,861 --> 01:31:39,740
out. I know Geraldo Rivera
taking his shirt off, man.

1617
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:44,390
Well drones are slamming in the
hut. Look, you know it's Thoreau.

1618
01:31:44,391 --> 01:31:49,100
Thoreau said, I see man everywhere
striking at the, at the branches of evil,

1619
01:31:49,101 --> 01:31:53,090
while none are hitting the route,
you got to know where the root starts man.

1620
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:57,260
So you know, know what the end, where
the real enemy is. That's very important.

1621
01:31:57,261 --> 01:32:00,910
Before you strike out, you got to know
and that takes, that takes some work.

1622
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,740
You got to earn that and that.

1623
01:32:02,741 --> 01:32:07,150
That's why I recommend the book republic
lost or@leastgototed.com and listen to

1624
01:32:07,151 --> 01:32:11,320
Lawrence Lessig give,
show you why we are losing our republic.

1625
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:14,530
He does a very good job about it.
People argue with it.

1626
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:17,680
Sat next to a guy on a plane who was an
editor at Newsweek who said he doesn't

1627
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:21,490
know what he's talking about, but I was
very convinced and it was very scary.

1628
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:21,951
Well,

1629
01:32:21,951 --> 01:32:26,951
I think that the responsibility for
running this entire society cannot rest in

1630
01:32:27,171 --> 01:32:32,060
secret hands anymore and I think
the only way for society progressed,

1631
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:36,830
the way the culture of human interaction
has progressed since the Internet.

1632
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:40,850
The only way to cite for society
to catch up is to take away power.

1633
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:43,880
They have to relinquish
power that it has to be done.

1634
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:46,590
That's the only way
you're going to have a,

1635
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:51,640
a culture that is advancing commensurate
with the amount of people that are

1636
01:32:51,801 --> 01:32:52,634
advancing.

1637
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:56,000
Because otherwise you're going to have
a bunch of people that are trying to

1638
01:32:56,001 --> 01:33:01,001
control and steal resources and hold
on to influence and hold on to power.

1639
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:04,490
And they're going to realize that
there's fucking pounding at the gates

1640
01:33:04,491 --> 01:33:06,710
everywhere and they're not
going to open up the gates.

1641
01:33:06,711 --> 01:33:09,590
They're going to try to bolt them down
more and they're trying to scare people

1642
01:33:09,591 --> 01:33:12,200
away from the gates.
And that's what we're seeing now.

1643
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:16,280
What we're seeing now with things like
going after these whistle blowers as if

1644
01:33:16,281 --> 01:33:18,780
they were the most evil people
in the world. Meanwhile,

1645
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:24,100
the government itself is responsible
for thousands of people dying in drone

1646
01:33:24,411 --> 01:33:25,760
attacks that were innocent.

1647
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:30,200
That's thousands of murders and no
one is getting in trouble for these

1648
01:33:30,201 --> 01:33:34,490
accidental murders. Accidental
of course, but murders still.

1649
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:38,510
But yet this Snowden guy
is public enemy number one,

1650
01:33:38,511 --> 01:33:42,950
and they're pulling down planes with
the president of Austria in them they're

1651
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:46,070
diverting planes because they
thought that he was going to Austria.

1652
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:49,550
They land with this fucking guy. And
they're like, let me check your plane.

1653
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:52,190
And then he's like, what the
fuck are you doing? Like,

1654
01:33:52,191 --> 01:33:54,340
cause they thought that Snowden
was on this cat's plane.

1655
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,840
I mean they're taking planes out of the
sky, royal planes from other countries.

1656
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,920
It's craziness.

1657
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:06,200
And why is it because this guy caught
people doing shit that is illegal,

1658
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:10,820
immoral, and not wanted by any of the
people that voted folks into power.

1659
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:11,930
If you had to vote today,

1660
01:34:11,931 --> 01:34:15,500
should the NSA be able to
look at everyone's email
and everyone's fucking cell

1661
01:34:15,501 --> 01:34:19,520
phone records? We all say no.
100% if you didn't say no,

1662
01:34:19,521 --> 01:34:22,970
you're a bit not an American.
You're a fucking cunt.

1663
01:34:22,971 --> 01:34:25,610
You fascist piece of shit.
You want any.

1664
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:30,530
But because here's the deal about the
government, they're just people. Okay.

1665
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:33,920
There is no government. There is a bunch
of people that act as the government.

1666
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:36,560
But the reality of the government
is they're just people.

1667
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,380
And if there was only two of them
people, by the way, I mean, you know,

1668
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:43,190
imagine if there's only two Q government
and then you're the only population is

1669
01:34:43,191 --> 01:34:45,590
two people in government and you're the
population and they're telling you you

1670
01:34:45,591 --> 01:34:48,590
can't smoke weed. We're going to lock in
a cage. They tell you would kill them.

1671
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:49,790
You would say,
okay,

1672
01:34:49,791 --> 01:34:52,610
well I'm living with these people and
have to kill because they're trying to,

1673
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,010
they're trying to stop me from doing a
bunch of shit that doesn't have anything

1674
01:34:55,011 --> 01:34:55,844
to do with them.

1675
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:01,240
The idea only becomes reasonable when
you're governing 300 million people,

1676
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:05,930
then it's okay to throw them in a cage
if you catch them with a trunk full of

1677
01:35:05,931 --> 01:35:06,650
heroin.

1678
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:09,710
But if we were on an island together and
it was just you and me and I caught you

1679
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:11,330
doing heroin, I'd be like,
dude, what are you doing?

1680
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,710
I wouldn't build a fucking
bamboo cage and you know,

1681
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,580
dig a hole and throw you
in the bottom of it. Yeah.

1682
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:18,530
The other issue is this, you, you,

1683
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:23,540
if you have a government where the
people in it may be good people,

1684
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:29,500
but the, but the only way to get ahead
is by acting and behaving corrupt.

1685
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:31,930
That's where,
that's the insidious thing.

1686
01:35:31,931 --> 01:35:36,010
Let me give you an example of when
you go to Capitol Hill and you are on

1687
01:35:36,011 --> 01:35:40,090
politician and you're making 120
grand a year. You know what you're,

1688
01:35:40,091 --> 01:35:42,640
you know what? That's, you know what
you are in, you're in Grad school.

1689
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,820
You know what the, you know what the big
Kahuna is? You know what you wanna do.

1690
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,190
You want to work there for six,
seven,

1691
01:35:48,191 --> 01:35:51,430
eight years in Lawrence Lexicon does a
good job of showing this and then you

1692
01:35:51,431 --> 01:35:56,431
want to go work on k street for a lobbying
firm making 500 600 $700,000 a year.

1693
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:02,290
That's the goal.
Government has become big business.

1694
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:05,350
Government has become
a business unto itself

1695
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:08,600
and it's this, just like any other
business becomes competitive.

1696
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:10,280
People want to get ahead,
they want to,

1697
01:36:10,281 --> 01:36:13,060
and the only way to get ahead is to
make progress and want to make progress.

1698
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,020
To move forward.
What's it doing right now?

1699
01:36:15,021 --> 01:36:17,210
I've got to move it for
the only way to make money.

1700
01:36:17,211 --> 01:36:21,290
It's not by pulling back and having
less water and less this and less that,

1701
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:24,500
less control and know the way to make
money inside this system is to keep it

1702
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:28,040
pushing forward. That's right. But I think
it's going to lose its power. I just,

1703
01:36:28,041 --> 01:36:29,900
I don't think that's
going to be a revolution.

1704
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,280
Yeah. As you talk, I, I,

1705
01:36:31,281 --> 01:36:33,930
one of the things I was thinking about
as I'm optimistic in the sense that I

1706
01:36:33,931 --> 01:36:37,080
don't know how you control,
you can't control the truth.

1707
01:36:37,081 --> 01:36:41,220
The Internet is the access to information
that people have has never been better

1708
01:36:41,221 --> 01:36:44,820
in that sense. And, and we are
developing our own autonomy in many ways.

1709
01:36:44,821 --> 01:36:48,360
Look at you and I have a business that
we run primarily through the Internet.

1710
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:51,660
I mean, uh, you know, developing
an audience, doing podcasts,

1711
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:54,300
all these kinds of
things going on the road,

1712
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:57,240
you can actually start
becoming your own entity,

1713
01:36:57,241 --> 01:37:00,420
your own sort of source of income,
your own everything.

1714
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:04,200
And that's pretty new. I mean
so much of it is, you know,

1715
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:08,580
owning your own business,
branding yourself has never
been easier in some way.

1716
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:11,540
Never been easier. I would've
never been able to do it before.

1717
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:16,810
And I was very fortunate enough to witness
many different aspects of the birth

1718
01:37:17,961 --> 01:37:18,794
of the Internet.

1719
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:22,370
And one of the things that I got a chance
to witness was I was there when the

1720
01:37:22,371 --> 01:37:25,190
UFC existed only on the internet.
Yeah.

1721
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:29,550
The U of C lost its ability to be on
cable. They got banned from cable.

1722
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:33,830
So the only way people knew
about it is if you had direct TV,

1723
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:36,140
which wasn't as popular
back then as it is now.

1724
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:41,290
I mean we're talking about the 1990s the
early nineties and other than that like

1725
01:37:41,871 --> 01:37:43,520
you would,
he would hear about it on the Internet.

1726
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:48,230
You would go on these like forums with
your shitty ass modem. You're 56 k modem,

1727
01:37:48,231 --> 01:37:50,120
like a chunk, a chunk, chunk, chunk,

1728
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:54,260
chunk of as it was like slowly like move
its way down the page until he could

1729
01:37:54,261 --> 01:37:55,350
download the website.

1730
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:59,250
And that's how I found out almost about
all the events and different things that

1731
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:02,820
were going on there, like the mixed
martial arts.com it used to be,

1732
01:38:02,821 --> 01:38:06,480
I think it was submission fighting.com
and then it was mixed martial arts.com

1733
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:11,660
there was an mma.tv and then it's mixed
martial arts.com and it became at some,

1734
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:16,510
what's that noise dialing?
What is that? Okay.

1735
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,080
Don't do that. Thanks. Yeah, the,

1736
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,860
that sound that mean that those,

1737
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:26,870
those websites from back then like
doing that was the only way people

1738
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:32,220
communicated about information.
If it wasn't for that, no
one would have any idea.

1739
01:38:32,221 --> 01:38:34,890
There was even still on anymore.
Once you pull shit off cable,

1740
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:37,220
it's like it doesn't exist
anymore. It's gone. Yeah.

1741
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:41,130
But because of people like where the
fuck did you go? Whoa, what's going on?

1742
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:44,280
And so they would get online and people
that these communities sort of developed

1743
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:46,080
where people started
talking about things online.

1744
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:51,260
So I got to see a sport mixed martial
arts literally go from almost dying to

1745
01:38:52,531 --> 01:38:56,280
being partially revived to taking off all,

1746
01:38:56,370 --> 01:39:00,540
primarily through the momentum of the
Internet. Yeah. Incredible. Yeah, it's,

1747
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:04,470
this is a totally stand up comic and
being a musician or being a, you know,

1748
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,910
I mean look at even even like TV shows
Hassett cars winning all these awards,

1749
01:39:08,911 --> 01:39:12,330
man, it's strictly Internet. You
know, we're getting everything from,

1750
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:14,340
why wouldn't you? Well, they're bringing,

1751
01:39:14,341 --> 01:39:17,820
but Netflix is bringing back
arrested development. Yeah.
I know. How crazy is that?

1752
01:39:17,821 --> 01:39:20,310
People were like, what the fuck? Why did
the camps, that was just with our will,

1753
01:39:20,311 --> 01:39:22,860
our net in New York, he was doing,
he had it. He's been doing it.

1754
01:39:22,861 --> 01:39:25,140
They got them everybody together and
10 years later they're all doing it.

1755
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:26,760
There's so many people on Netflix now.

1756
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,490
Netflix just announced we're going to
start doing standup comedy specials.

1757
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:32,660
I did my first special on Netflix,
one of my first specials. Yeah.

1758
01:39:32,661 --> 01:39:36,270
Thinking about it. Why not fucking
great. I still do. They want,

1759
01:39:36,271 --> 01:39:38,970
they all watch my first special on
Netflix. Why wouldn't they watch?

1760
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:41,520
Why not just go right to
Netflix and do it. To this day,

1761
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:45,800
I get tweets about my 2005
special yeah. From, from Netflix.

1762
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:46,621
That was the one,

1763
01:39:46,621 --> 01:39:51,270
the beginning of the whole eat the
sandwich thing about a society and human

1764
01:39:51,271 --> 01:39:54,180
beings are sorta like mold on a sandwich
that I think we might be here to eat

1765
01:39:54,181 --> 01:39:59,040
the sandwich. You know, it's, it's
the, the horrifying revelation. Right.

1766
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:00,810
Did you, uh, there's a,

1767
01:40:00,811 --> 01:40:05,460
a recent article about the Pacific
Garbage Patch, about the, uh,

1768
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:08,370
the new, uh, measurements of
the Pacific garbage patch.

1769
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:14,370
It's closing in on California. It's
getting, getting closer to us. It's this,

1770
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,250
if you haven't paid attention to,

1771
01:40:16,251 --> 01:40:18,420
this is something we haven't talked
about in the podcast in a long time,

1772
01:40:18,421 --> 01:40:20,700
but Google Pacific garbage patch,

1773
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:24,300
it's essentially like there's a tide,
there's a current,

1774
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,970
the way the oceans move,
the way the currents move,

1775
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:32,180
it developed this sort of area where all
the shit that's floating in the ocean

1776
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:38,690
coalesced and combined into this
enormous soup of fucking rotting plastic.

1777
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:39,901
Wow.

1778
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:44,901
Slowly degrading plastic that
kills millions of animals a year.

1779
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:50,390
It kills scoopers. I mean
it's like Texas sized. Yeah.

1780
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:55,120
It's so big. It's insane. And
it's not like a solid thing.

1781
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:58,160
It's like soup. Yeah. So
it's little pieces. Yeah.

1782
01:40:58,161 --> 01:41:00,880
And it in the sun and in the ocean,

1783
01:41:00,881 --> 01:41:04,630
the saltwater and the surf and everything
like that, it's slowly breaks down to,

1784
01:41:04,631 --> 01:41:07,040
it's like floating pellets and shit.
Yeah.

1785
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:11,320
And what's a fish and everything eats
it. They eat it and they die. Fish.

1786
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:15,480
Birds that eat it and they die.
It's just a millions of them and it's,

1787
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,470
the whole thing is enormous and no one's
cleaning it and it's getting bigger.

1788
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:24,150
It's constantly getting bigger
people or leave the new technology,

1789
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,530
three d printing and stuff like that.
We're going to have less waste.

1790
01:41:26,531 --> 01:41:30,370
Less transport. Right. I mean, I don't
know. That's an interesting possibility.

1791
01:41:30,371 --> 01:41:33,880
I think the ultimate reality,
which would be the best,

1792
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:38,920
is if we develop something that can eat
plastic and somehow you can control it.

1793
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:42,520
Well, they have those kinds of
things, but it's, it's close. Yeah.

1794
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:45,660
But it's also a look. What happens once
it gets done eating plastic. Well, hm.

1795
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:49,180
I like people to write no more plastic.
Let's start eating feats.

1796
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,210
There are bacteria that you
can, you know, that we do use,

1797
01:41:52,211 --> 01:41:54,850
I guess enzymes and bacteria
that actually do that now,

1798
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:58,610
but whether or not it's biocompatible
and yeah, those are the questions.

1799
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:01,040
Yeah. The march of science.
Well, there's been some,

1800
01:42:01,041 --> 01:42:05,450
some thought about doing various things
to clean up the ocean and one of the

1801
01:42:05,451 --> 01:42:06,430
things is,
uh,

1802
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:10,820
actually introducing certain
allergies and introducing iron, uh,

1803
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,240
taking metal and creating a
metal structures and putting
these metal structures

1804
01:42:14,241 --> 01:42:18,740
in the bottom of the ocean that would a
attract various types of algae and that

1805
01:42:18,741 --> 01:42:23,650
various types of algae,
those would, uh, re oxygenate
through you, through, you know,

1806
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:26,670
their use of whatever the
fuck they need in the, uh,

1807
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:30,840
in the ocean and actually clean up
some of the water. And sometimes

1808
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:34,260
I feel like all these problems are put
there for a reason than anything is

1809
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:39,180
surmountable. Oh, you're so cute. I
know. Any reason? No, no. Do I just,

1810
01:42:39,181 --> 01:42:43,450
anything is anything as solvable including
then happens, happens for a reason.

1811
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:47,810
So all that stuff is all annoying. It's
annoying, but then it's not right. Well,

1812
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:51,120
I'm with you. I believe what
you're saying. I believe, I
believe it's a law. I mean,

1813
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:54,480
anything, any challenge. Human
beings do incredible things, man.

1814
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,400
He's going to be things come up with,

1815
01:42:56,430 --> 01:43:00,360
do you ever hear the story about more
the guy who created Morse code like that

1816
01:43:00,361 --> 01:43:03,750
was the most revolutionary as the turning
point in history? What more? More,

1817
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,240
because if you think about it,
it Alexander the Great

1818
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,350
in 19 who's 1820 when it was invented,

1819
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:12,060
I think I hit the when the
first time they actually,

1820
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:15,900
I think it was 1819 when the first time
they actually had a 10 mile stretch of

1821
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,880
of wire and the guy was able to
send a message and before that,

1822
01:43:20,881 --> 01:43:23,880
think about this. Before
that the, the guy,

1823
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:26,190
the guy before an 18 whatever,

1824
01:43:26,191 --> 01:43:30,420
1815 he had to send a
message the same exact way.

1825
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:35,490
Alexander the Great did
either on horseback, either
on foot or either by boat.

1826
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:39,840
Okay. And when Morse code came up and
Morris was a guy who was a really,

1827
01:43:39,841 --> 01:43:44,400
really successful painter. Okay. And He'd
had nothing to do with electronic Madec.

1828
01:43:44,401 --> 01:43:47,880
Magnetic fields are, I think was a
really successful painter. His wife,

1829
01:43:47,881 --> 01:43:50,430
he gets what we get to letter
that his wife is very sick.

1830
01:43:50,431 --> 01:43:54,050
He loved his in Connecticut. By the
time he gets there, she's not only dead,

1831
01:43:54,051 --> 01:43:55,850
she's been buried.
And he said,

1832
01:43:55,851 --> 01:43:58,940
this gotta be a way I can get information
faster because it killed them.

1833
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:01,460
It was this tragedy. Seven
years later, he's on a boat.

1834
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:05,990
He meets this electromagnetic engineer.
He starts talking to him.

1835
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:11,120
He gets fascinated with the idea that
maybe I can come up with a way to use

1836
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:16,070
electromagnetic fields to send a message.
About 10 years after that,

1837
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:21,380
he invented something called Morse code,
this painter, because he was so broke,

1838
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:24,590
heartbroken over his wife,
and, and, and by the end,

1839
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:25,970
the world has never been the same.

1840
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:30,050
That was a bigger communication leap
actually than the Internet because it was

1841
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:33,860
the first time we were able to send
instantaneous messages. Uh, and,

1842
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:36,430
and I think five years
later we finally had a,

1843
01:44:36,431 --> 01:44:38,360
a wire from New York to New Orleans,

1844
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,890
which was so much faster and you
could get instantaneous communication.

1845
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:44,390
The world was never the same.
And of course we built on that,

1846
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,920
but there's the history so full of
individuals that we're trying to solve a

1847
01:44:48,921 --> 01:44:53,921
problem that seemed insurmountable and
oftentimes it was because they basically,

1848
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:58,550
um, like Alexander Fleming
had a cold. He, he,

1849
01:44:58,551 --> 01:45:00,230
his snot fell into,

1850
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:03,380
he had all these petri dishes working
on different spores and stuff,

1851
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,350
and he decided to clean stuff out himself.

1852
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:09,650
He never used to clean his own petri
dishes. He had a cold, is snot,

1853
01:45:09,651 --> 01:45:14,651
fell into one of the moldy dishes and
he realized that the bacteria under the

1854
01:45:14,661 --> 01:45:18,170
microscope, the mold that killed all
the bacteria and he went, wait a minute.

1855
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:21,020
That's how we invented a little
something called penicillin,

1856
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:25,640
which then became antibiotics, which is
why people are alive. It's crazy. So many,

1857
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:28,970
so many of these things either happen
through accident with individuals or

1858
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,590
people were trying to solve a problem.
Yeah.

1859
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,620
That's one of the things about
life is that you need struggle.

1860
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:39,930
It seems like you shouldn't have
it, but you need it. Oh Man.

1861
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:43,490
One of the worst things that can happen
is when people don't struggle anymore

1862
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:47,090
and then they start to suck and
they used to be awesome. You know,

1863
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:51,590
you see it with musicians time and time
again. You see it with certain Comedians,

1864
01:45:51,591 --> 01:45:55,100
you see it with certain writers,
see it with certain actors,

1865
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,230
they they lose whatever the fuck it was
that they had when they were struggling.

1866
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,980
When they're struggling and they had a
show up and they, you know, they just,

1867
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:08,030
sometimes it's good to,
to be criticized.

1868
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:12,650
Sometimes it's good to fail and cause
that fail can be like a turbocharger that

1869
01:46:12,651 --> 01:46:15,350
kicks you into the, the
next, the next base.

1870
01:46:15,351 --> 01:46:17,810
A wolf at the door is usually
luxury at some of struggle.

1871
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:22,610
Biggest leaps in my comedy career
have come after bombing. Me Too.

1872
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:24,080
My biggest leaps,

1873
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:28,070
one of my biggest ones ever in
New York came after bombing.

1874
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,100
One of my biggest ones in
Boston came after bombing.

1875
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:34,670
I've had him in La that came
after bombing. One of my,

1876
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:38,180
one of the reasons why I just,
I dove back into comedy.

1877
01:46:38,181 --> 01:46:41,660
I bombed one night at the comedy store
when I was doing news radio and a bunch

1878
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:45,800
of the writers came to watch me and I
ate Dick [inaudible] Dick at 1:00 AM.

1879
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:49,760
That's terrible. He's the
main room at 1:00 AM you've
been there. That's the spot.

1880
01:46:49,761 --> 01:46:50,040
So I used

1881
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,660
to get back then,
you know I was a nobody,

1882
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:56,160
so I just get these spots after everybody
had ripped that place sideways and

1883
01:46:56,161 --> 01:47:00,780
there's 20 people left and then I
went onto this dead crowd, my shitty,

1884
01:47:01,950 --> 01:47:05,970
who don't speak English, just stirring
their drinks. I've been up in there.

1885
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:09,960
It was death and then I realized,
Oh my God, I'm coasting.

1886
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:11,880
Like I realize like I went up there,

1887
01:47:11,881 --> 01:47:15,450
I thought I could do the same jokes I've
been doing for years with no passion

1888
01:47:15,451 --> 01:47:17,250
and no energy,
no excitement to them,

1889
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:21,000
and I felt it while other people took
it in because the room wasn't giving me

1890
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:24,510
nothing. I had, I had to bring it myself
and you can bring it if you're good,

1891
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,100
you can't bring it if
you actually have it.

1892
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,350
But that's when you find
out if you're faking it,

1893
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:32,130
when there's 10 people in the crowd,
you know anything less than 50 people,

1894
01:47:32,131 --> 01:47:34,140
you can't trick those fucking
people in the laughing.

1895
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,320
You're either funny or you're not right,
but a 200 person,

1896
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,770
you could sometimes why we
all know and no disrespect,

1897
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:45,420
but we all know there's those people that
can go on at the laugh factory at like

1898
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:49,830
eight 30 on a Friday when everyone's
laughing at everything and you can watch

1899
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:54,831
this bizarre mayonnaise sandwich
of an act where you're like,

1900
01:47:55,741 --> 01:47:57,480
what did I even just see?

1901
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:02,340
But yet the pauses are in the right place
and people are laughing and the the,

1902
01:48:02,341 --> 01:48:06,900
the person's dressed right and
they don't stay too long. You know,

1903
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:09,720
you'd do like 10 15
minutes and good enough.

1904
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:13,110
You hit on enough buzz
words that people like, Oh,

1905
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:15,420
you brought up some things
that people think is funny,

1906
01:48:15,421 --> 01:48:19,560
like Kanye West or whatever. You know,
it's enough. You did it. You were safe.

1907
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:21,000
You got through it.
Yeah.

1908
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:26,180
But that same person put them on the
comedy store at 1:00 AM in front of 20

1909
01:48:26,281 --> 01:48:30,740
people and they will get nothing.
Zero.

1910
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,840
The death march through those shitty
dry words tumbling out of your mouth,

1911
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:38,400
like dirt,
like literally dirt

1912
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:42,800
coming out of your mouth. Well, you know,

1913
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:46,520
they always say that. I say, why?
Why? Why was Louis Armstrong so great?

1914
01:48:46,521 --> 01:48:49,940
And some of those black musicians who are
doing incredible things with the horn.

1915
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:52,370
And there was this historian, I
can't remember his name. He said,

1916
01:48:52,371 --> 01:48:55,880
well when you were black back then,
you weren't allowed to speak your mind.

1917
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:59,510
You Express yourself through
your horn man. And, and they,

1918
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:02,990
that he was trying to say something,
he was really trying to sense that horn.

1919
01:49:02,991 --> 01:49:04,330
Yeah.
So it,

1920
01:49:04,331 --> 01:49:08,000
it really is a question of
what your motivation is and
how important inspiration

1921
01:49:08,001 --> 01:49:12,500
and motivation is to keep yourself going,
man. Yeah. You have to have something,

1922
01:49:12,501 --> 01:49:13,050
man.
You

1923
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:16,740
gotta you gotta be Anita. I
keep myself uneasy, you know,

1924
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:20,700
and I do it. I don't do it cause
I'm better than other people.

1925
01:49:20,701 --> 01:49:22,950
I don't do it because I'm smarter.
I don't want to,

1926
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:27,820
I do it because I failed and I
realize why failed. I realize what,

1927
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,720
what made me fail and then I
don't do it that way anymore.

1928
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:34,710
It's really that simple. I am
the, I'm not better than anybody.

1929
01:49:34,711 --> 01:49:39,711
What I am is a guy who did a lot of shit
and failed miserably a bunch of times

1930
01:49:40,111 --> 01:49:43,980
and then hated that feeling and it
made sure that I didn't do that again.

1931
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:49,460
So the only reason why I keep myself
uncomfortable now is that of sheer terror.

1932
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:53,530
That was the feeling of that
I had before when I would,

1933
01:49:53,850 --> 01:49:58,060
when I've bombed or when I've, when I've
have asked something or when I haven't,

1934
01:49:58,690 --> 01:50:01,810
I haven't pushed as hard as I
can. So driven. I'm not as driven.

1935
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:04,300
I want to see what I have inside me.
I'm curious.

1936
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:08,050
I'm also really driven by curiosity.
My Ego thing isn't there? No,

1937
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:11,620
I don't think so actually. What's
inside? I don't think it's an ego thing.

1938
01:50:11,621 --> 01:50:14,310
I think for me it's like inside me,

1939
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:20,170
my buddy, my buddy I was just with,
I went to visit in Europe. He's,

1940
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:22,300
he's made about a billion dollars.

1941
01:50:22,301 --> 01:50:24,580
Went to college with them and I'm not
kidding when I say that he's got the

1942
01:50:24,581 --> 01:50:26,980
craziest house and I said,
what drives you man? I said,

1943
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:28,990
you own the two fastest
growing banks in Europe.

1944
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:32,550
You've got crazy money to staff were
flying around in your private jet. What?

1945
01:50:32,551 --> 01:50:36,400
What is it that drives you?
And he said, he looked at me,
he goes, he goes, look man,

1946
01:50:36,401 --> 01:50:39,250
I liked building things cause I'm
never sure if I can really do it.

1947
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:44,110
It's just always a rush to deal to try
to build something and see if I still

1948
01:50:44,111 --> 01:50:46,780
have it,
see if I can still do it,

1949
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:50,590
see if it's a new challenge and just
try it and it has nothing to do with the

1950
01:50:50,591 --> 01:50:54,160
money. That's just like he's made
more than anybody could ever spend.

1951
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:56,930
Well that's when it becomes like a
weird game that your plants where it is.

1952
01:50:56,990 --> 01:51:00,580
Like for Bill Gates has certain time
Bill Gates had to realize that he could

1953
01:51:00,581 --> 01:51:02,620
never spend all that shit.
If you get,

1954
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:07,840
if you really do get to keep it like I'm
not sure what happens when you have $98

1955
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:11,800
billion when it goes up 50 billion
and then down when the market shifts,

1956
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,440
like that's the weirdest thing about
those guys when you look at it like their

1957
01:51:14,441 --> 01:51:18,310
net worth and then like he used
to be 90 million or 90 billion,

1958
01:51:18,311 --> 01:51:20,830
now it's 40 billion. You're like, well,
we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll wait.

1959
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:24,100
Where the fuck did that go? Right?
Like what happened? They're like,

1960
01:51:24,101 --> 01:51:27,220
you lost 50 blood. Wait a
minute. What do you even saying?

1961
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:29,350
But at a certain point in time,

1962
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:35,040
what if he stopped now how much money
would he have every year just to spend?

1963
01:51:35,741 --> 01:51:38,470
It would be an insane
amount of money he's done.

1964
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,870
There's that thing about Bill Gates 10
years ago when they said if he dropped

1965
01:51:40,871 --> 01:51:42,670
$40,000 out of his pocket,

1966
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:46,720
it wouldn't be worth him turning around
to get it because his time is worth much

1967
01:51:46,721 --> 01:51:50,370
more than the time it would take actually
turn around and pick up the $40,000

1968
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:54,640
make it would make, it
would be financially prudent
for him to keep walking.

1969
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:58,770
That hurts my brain. I
love that stuff. Nah,

1970
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:01,910
now you dropped a $40,000, whatever
it was. It's something crazy.

1971
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:06,880
I was looking online at houses that like,
you know,

1972
01:52:06,881 --> 01:52:11,560
rich people own like oh per style houses
and Oprah, Oprah's houses everywhere.

1973
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:14,690
Um,
but she's got this house in Montecito a,

1974
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,420
which is the nice area outside of Santa
Barbara, like really old, old school,

1975
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:21,100
beautiful homes,
really beautiful,

1976
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:25,060
beautiful neighborhood near the
ocean and her house. It's like,

1977
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:28,030
how do you have enough money for,
this is one of your houses.

1978
01:52:28,031 --> 01:52:30,320
It doesn't even make any
sense that one person can,

1979
01:52:30,321 --> 01:52:33,430
you accumulate that much money and then
when you stop and look at it and go,

1980
01:52:33,431 --> 01:52:36,970
wait a minute, how did she do that? She's
just talking like Oprah doesn't do shit.

1981
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:40,740
She's not juggling.
She hasn't played guitar and inspiring.

1982
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:45,010
She doesn't play guitar. She doesn't,
she's not the fastest race car driver.

1983
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:49,600
She doesn't pull vaults.
All she does is talk and like a,

1984
01:52:49,610 --> 01:52:54,590
we'll be right back and like she's got a
hundred fucking kazillion cause she was

1985
01:52:54,591 --> 01:52:57,980
a source of major inspiration
for millions of women.

1986
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:02,480
It's insane to look at her house, her
house in crazy. Oh my God. It's insane.

1987
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,711
It's incredible.

1988
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:07,700
I'm Oh in when I was doing fat actress
and she was redoing Kirsty alleys,

1989
01:53:07,701 --> 01:53:12,610
kitchen and uh, the culture was doing,
Huh? Why was she doing that? I don't know.

1990
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:15,740
Some thing that she decided to
do redo Kirsty alleys. Kitchen.

1991
01:53:15,741 --> 01:53:18,680
It was going to be on the program.
You know that they showed it on the Oprah.

1992
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:21,830
Oh yeah. I was there while they
were renovating and I believe that,

1993
01:53:21,831 --> 01:53:23,660
I'm sorry Christie,
if I'm talking out of line,

1994
01:53:23,661 --> 01:53:27,590
but I think it costs 700 grand
just to Redo the kitchen. Dude,

1995
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:31,220
that's that a hundred grand and we
do the kitchen. I'll fucking kill it.

1996
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:36,100
Was it taught, I don't know, just big, Eh,
not worth 700 grand to me. But it looked,

1997
01:53:36,101 --> 01:53:38,690
it was all detailed with incredible
mosaic and all that stuff.

1998
01:53:38,691 --> 01:53:42,770
But you got to think that she's like
really big and she probably needs a lot of

1999
01:53:42,771 --> 01:53:47,300
food and so you need to comment a
lot of refrigerators and shit. She,

2000
01:53:47,301 --> 01:53:50,750
as far as like hot chicks that
God gigantic, she's numero uno.

2001
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:55,250
There's never been like a super hot
chick who got gigantic and then stayed

2002
01:53:55,251 --> 01:54:00,140
arrogant. She's very extreme. Yeah.
Like stayed out there, stayed bold.

2003
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:01,730
She's, you know, out there, you know,

2004
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:04,400
would talk about losing the weight
and then lose weight, you know,

2005
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:08,240
drop a hundred pounds, you know, do
a fucking weight loss commercial.

2006
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,910
She went cold on me too and we hung out.

2007
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:14,150
I loved her kids and we did that show
and then she just never called me back.

2008
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:17,490
I was like, what happened after he did
the show? You stop being an enduring. She,

2009
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:21,590
we were all, we were doing fat actress.
Something happened where she, you fucker,

2010
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:26,420
no, no, no. But she just went cold. I
mean, I never understood it and she,

2011
01:54:26,421 --> 01:54:30,810
she just, she just went dead
cold on me. And, uh, you assign,

2012
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:34,430
is she a psychologist at me? Yeah, she
was signed. I'm reading going clear now.

2013
01:54:34,431 --> 01:54:39,090
And your recommendation, right?
Yeah. Ooh. Just you wait,

2014
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:43,860
I'm about 50 pages in and just start.
Oh, oh, please continue. But it's, it's,

2015
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:46,760
it's absolutely fascinating.
He also wrote a great book, uh,

2016
01:54:46,761 --> 01:54:50,960
Lawrence Wright about the looming
tower. Which house or bad about the, uh,

2017
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:55,940
the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and
culminating in nine 11. We're fascinating.

2018
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:59,540
You have to read that next. You have
to. You just have to, I would love to.

2019
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:05,270
Any religious fundamentalism scares
the shit out of me. Yeah. It's just,

2020
01:55:05,271 --> 01:55:09,080
it's a prison of Scientology is a
religious fundamentalism and that's what's

2021
01:55:09,081 --> 01:55:10,280
fascinating about his book.

2022
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:13,730
It religious fundamentalism has
nothing to do with the truth.

2023
01:55:13,731 --> 01:55:16,280
It has nothing to do with some
ancient shit that God told people.

2024
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:20,750
It has to do with another
possibility of the human existence.

2025
01:55:20,751 --> 01:55:23,780
Just like we were talking about a car
that a car has a bunch of shit he can do,

2026
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:26,480
he can hit the brakes.
You could corner at one g,

2027
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:29,120
you can accelerate to 60 in five seconds.

2028
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,900
It has all these things that it can
do well. It can also fall into a cult.

2029
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,530
That's what a person can do.
Like this.

2030
01:55:34,531 --> 01:55:36,830
I would all this shit that a person
could do, a person could make coffee,

2031
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:41,210
a person can use the computer, a person
can have sex and make a baby. Oh,

2032
01:55:41,211 --> 01:55:45,130
they can also fall into a cult.
They can also be,

2033
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:48,480
we were in a Utah fill in my
show last week, Duncan and I,

2034
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:53,280
and we showed up at the airport and he
was one of the strangest things I've ever

2035
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:54,150
made.
Anytime life.

2036
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:59,400
They had these people that were
returning from missions and uh, their,

2037
01:55:59,401 --> 01:56:03,180
their elders, they call them elders and
charter people there with signs, right?

2038
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:07,320
Screaming like they're rock stars.

2039
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:12,500
I mean high pitch cheers and screaming
and with these giant signs that say,

2040
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:17,910
welcome home, Elder Richardson,
welcome whole El elder white.

2041
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:22,350
My parents live in park city, so I see it.
Yeah, yeah. That's where we went. We went,

2042
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:25,140
well, we went to park city.
That's what we ate at park city.

2043
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:28,560
And then we did our thing, uh, which
was about two hours outside of that,

2044
01:56:28,561 --> 01:56:33,060
which is God's country man. Just
fucking beautiful. And Park City.

2045
01:56:33,061 --> 01:56:35,030
I'd only been there in the winter pants.

2046
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:37,680
We went skiing there once the
winter and it was beautiful.

2047
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:40,590
But then we went there in the summer
and they told me that what's even better

2048
01:56:40,591 --> 01:56:44,040
than skiing is you take the lifts,
the lifts operate all year round.

2049
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:47,220
He take the lifts and you take a
mountain bike down those hills.

2050
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:50,280
That was perfect. Ski Hills. They
say it's insane cause you got to,

2051
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:52,860
you got breaks now.
She didn't go fucking drink.

2052
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:57,330
You driving them fucking a bike down
those hills. It's supposed to be amazing.

2053
01:56:57,570 --> 01:57:01,400
You don't have to drive up. You take
the fucking the lift up, done it. Oh,

2054
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:03,990
you've done it with the dirt Mike
down a mountain bike. Mountain bike.

2055
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:06,840
It's supposed to be amazing. It's
supposed to be even more fun than skiing,

2056
01:57:06,841 --> 01:57:10,530
which sounds crazy. But uh,
the, the, the area there,

2057
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:15,180
it's so God damn gorgeous man.
I've been hiking so gorgeous.

2058
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:18,570
My parents house and just go hiking
and it's just, it's a do it alone.

2059
01:57:18,571 --> 01:57:19,171
It's incredible.

2060
01:57:19,171 --> 01:57:23,220
It almost doesn't bother me that all
these fucking people are crazy religious

2061
01:57:23,221 --> 01:57:26,300
park city. There are, there are no, there
aren't a lot of Mormon. No, they're not.

2062
01:57:26,301 --> 01:57:29,630
It's, it's salt lake. But you got to land
in Salt Lake and that's where you say,

2063
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:34,230
hey listen. Nice piece. I say they're very
nice people. They keep it very clean. Uh,

2064
01:57:34,231 --> 01:57:37,580
state. I got no problem with Mormons. I
never got beat up by a Mormon. I list. I,

2065
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:39,120
I have some friends that were,

2066
01:57:39,121 --> 01:57:42,240
Mormons were friends with
them when they're Mormons
and they eventually bailed.

2067
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:45,780
There's really kind of interesting to
watch them bail on being a Mormon, uh,

2068
01:57:45,781 --> 01:57:47,850
because uh,
they just,

2069
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:50,400
they got to a certain point in
their life where they're like,

2070
01:57:50,401 --> 01:57:51,240
what the fuck are we doing?

2071
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:54,820
Which is really interesting to see when
people hit like 40 and then they start

2072
01:57:54,821 --> 01:57:55,654
doing that.

2073
01:57:55,890 --> 01:58:00,890
But these people living in this state
and a giant percentage of them being

2074
01:58:01,411 --> 01:58:03,140
involved in this one call and,

2075
01:58:03,141 --> 01:58:06,180
but that cult seems to work
for them for the most part.

2076
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:11,250
Like they get those weird,
uh, aberrations, like they
branch off like occasionally.

2077
01:58:11,251 --> 01:58:13,170
And have that one guy that got arrested.
What was his name?

2078
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:16,220
Jeff something or another
that, that far, yeah. Whoa.

2079
01:58:16,221 --> 01:58:19,810
What the fuck is that guy's
name? He was Mormon Church. Um,

2080
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:24,690
I believe outlawed
polygamy. Uh, like in 18,

2081
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:28,400
you know, night. Very, very, like
in the 1800 [inaudible] were there,

2082
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:31,340
there was a sect that split off a bunch
of guys who are perverts who were like,

2083
01:58:31,341 --> 01:58:35,880
oh shit. Which I sympathize with
the freeze, right? Yes, yes, yes.

2084
01:58:35,881 --> 01:58:37,920
And he went to jail for
a long time. Yeah. Well,

2085
01:58:37,921 --> 01:58:41,620
what's even more interesting is that
one of those groups that branched off

2086
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:43,240
because didn't want to
give up the polygamy,

2087
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:47,440
was the guy who was running for president,

2088
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:50,120
Mitt Romney's family.
Rarely.

2089
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:53,890
Mitt Romney is a super Mormon.
In fact,

2090
01:58:53,891 --> 01:58:56,860
his family lives in Mexico.

2091
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:02,040
His father couldn't run for president
because his father was born in Mexico.

2092
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:05,440
So Mitt Romney was born in America,

2093
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:09,700
but his dad was a part of the cult that
moved to Mexico because they didn't want

2094
01:59:09,701 --> 01:59:14,590
to give up the pussy. So they have these,
it used to be vote for Mitt Romney.

2095
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:18,400
Next act before there were cars.
It didn't matter if you were in Mexico,

2096
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:22,330
it's like you're in Mexico, United
States and the 18 hundreds it was like,

2097
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:25,810
they were like, well, if you want
to, you want to be an American,

2098
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:30,070
you cannot have multiple wives. They're
like, oh, but I can have multiple wives.

2099
01:59:30,071 --> 01:59:33,820
I just crossed that river, take
care of CLL. It's off for now.

2100
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:36,970
And then all of sudden you're over
there and then someone invents something

2101
01:59:36,971 --> 01:59:38,250
called cars. Well, the,

2102
01:59:38,251 --> 01:59:41,170
the whole world changes because now
people are moving back and forth and it's

2103
01:59:41,171 --> 01:59:43,690
really easy to do so. And
then you realize, oh shit,

2104
01:59:43,691 --> 01:59:47,230
there's a wall between me and the most
prosperous area and it's right over there.

2105
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:51,400
And then the area around you becomes
filled with people that are involved in

2106
01:59:51,401 --> 01:59:53,920
something called the drug war,
and then you're fucked.

2107
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:58,540
So now his family that lives in Mexico,
they're armed to the teeth healing.

2108
01:59:58,570 --> 02:00:02,950
They live in giant compounds,
vice vice.com. Man,

2109
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:05,920
my friend Shane Smith told me about this
is the first time I heard about it and

2110
02:00:05,921 --> 02:00:10,921
then I there's multiple articles
confirming this not like very interesting

2111
02:00:11,651 --> 02:00:16,300
phenomena. Bad Ass. And it's not like
there, um, this is speculation of theory.

2112
02:00:16,301 --> 02:00:20,170
You know, this is real. I mean it goes on
in there. We're not just vice, many, many,

2113
02:00:20,171 --> 02:00:20,741
many,
many,

2114
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:25,741
many people have documented these
Mormon cults in Mexico and there's some

2115
02:00:26,021 --> 02:00:29,320
serious conflict with the,
the drug lords in Mexico.

2116
02:00:29,321 --> 02:00:33,280
They kidnapped him cause kidnapping is
a huge source of income and like Mexico

2117
02:00:33,281 --> 02:00:36,370
City and a lot of places as
far as like crime, kidnapping,

2118
02:00:36,371 --> 02:00:39,870
people's a big deal to the point where
they tell you don't drive around a bullet.

2119
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:40,750
Nice car.
I know,

2120
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:44,840
but bulletproof cars specifically cause
he target those because they figured you

2121
02:00:44,850 --> 02:00:47,770
have money. Yes, because all your, what
do you, what's in there? Some money.

2122
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:49,240
What's in the hiding something.

2123
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:52,150
These are jewel of a person
in there that I can sell.

2124
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:56,800
And so there they were doing that whole
economy with the families like these,

2125
02:00:56,801 --> 02:00:59,410
these cults that live in
these giant compounds.

2126
02:00:59,411 --> 02:01:03,700
She's like several families that moved
to Mexico and Mitt Romney's family's a

2127
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:08,570
part of that. I'd get out of
there. Yeah. You think? Yeah. Yeah.

2128
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:13,590
It's one of the weirdest aspects of
society in the year 2013 is that we are

2129
02:01:14,081 --> 02:01:18,370
connected to one of the most
dangerous areas in the world. Juarez.

2130
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:23,110
Mexico is one of the most dangerous
spots to be a human being and live in the

2131
02:01:23,111 --> 02:01:25,780
world.
More dangerous in fact and I rack was,

2132
02:01:25,781 --> 02:01:29,020
well I think that's where the Zach does
came out of and I think they've been,

2133
02:01:29,410 --> 02:01:33,100
I think they've been kind of, they've
been kind of brought under control.

2134
02:01:33,101 --> 02:01:35,360
I don't know that the, the, the,

2135
02:01:35,361 --> 02:01:40,361
the issue is that the economy of
Mexico and the power structure,

2136
02:01:41,031 --> 02:01:43,400
the entrenched power structure itself is,

2137
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:47,420
relies on the drug
economy from corruption.

2138
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:51,560
Just completely out of control.
Yeah. I mean the cops, by
the way, their neighbors,

2139
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:55,970
the United States of the biggest consumers
of that product. So, you know, a,

2140
02:01:56,010 --> 02:02:01,010
as long as there is a demand, they're
going to supply it. And uh, either, uh,

2141
02:02:01,011 --> 02:02:02,300
but don't legalize it,

2142
02:02:02,301 --> 02:02:06,290
don't legalize it will just so we've
got 52,000 body bags and counting,

2143
02:02:06,291 --> 02:02:08,630
I think in Mexico since this
shit happened. You know,

2144
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:13,640
Mexico has silently decriminalized
drugs. Well, I don't, I don't blame them.

2145
02:02:13,641 --> 02:02:14,420
And I'll tell you why.

2146
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:19,070
They've been the ones bearing the brunt
with real tragedy in their bodies and

2147
02:02:19,071 --> 02:02:22,730
their children and their neighborhoods
that they're the ones who have been

2148
02:02:22,731 --> 02:02:26,990
dealing with this. We've been the ones
consuming it and it's got, you know,

2149
02:02:26,991 --> 02:02:31,260
so I again, yet again, you know,
if people want to do something,

2150
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:33,200
they're going to do it. So I'm
trying to control people's behavior.

2151
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:37,790
They decriminalized everything in
2009 to try to slow everything down.

2152
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:40,780
It's very rarely talked about. Like
when we talked, I didn't know that.

2153
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,780
I'm interested in hearing that,
but I heard a little of it.

2154
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:47,450
When people talk about
decriminalization though,

2155
02:02:47,451 --> 02:02:51,740
the example they always give is Portugal
because Portugal did essentially the

2156
02:02:51,741 --> 02:02:54,350
same thing. They made all drugs,
legal, they decriminalized everything.

2157
02:02:54,351 --> 02:02:56,720
He can't sell them, but you can
possess them. If you get caught,

2158
02:02:56,721 --> 02:03:00,110
they give you treatment. No one goes
to jail. Well, when Portugal did that,

2159
02:03:00,111 --> 02:03:03,800
they're fucking rates of addiction
dropped. Their rates of crime dropped.

2160
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:08,600
But let me ask you this, when, when, and
you know more about it than I do. We'd,

2161
02:03:08,601 --> 02:03:11,360
for all intensive purposes in
Colorado for example, is legal.

2162
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:16,610
But that's the state. That's a statutory
law. It's still not a federal law.

2163
02:03:16,611 --> 02:03:21,611
So the Fed can come in
actually technically close
those deposit repositories

2164
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:26,610
down and all that, right? Yes. Not
only that, even the medical draw,

2165
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:29,410
like the idea of medical
marijuana, the, the,

2166
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:33,080
the federal government does not recognize
the fact that it's even a medicine.

2167
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:34,850
So the federal government,

2168
02:03:34,851 --> 02:03:38,510
the reason why marijuana is a schedule
one substance is not because it's the

2169
02:03:38,511 --> 02:03:41,240
most dangerous. Because if it
was based on proof that it was,

2170
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:44,300
it would be impossible to put
marijuana in schedule one.

2171
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:48,470
But they can put marijuana in schedule
one because schedule one means has no

2172
02:03:48,471 --> 02:03:52,460
medicinal value. That's, that's recognized
by the state, by the federal government.

2173
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:55,610
So because the fact they
put it in a schedule one,

2174
02:03:55,611 --> 02:04:00,611
then it refutes all the medical marijuana
clinics because mine have medical

2175
02:04:01,131 --> 02:04:05,630
cocaine. You can have medical, if there's
applications for opiates, like pills,

2176
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:08,950
those are all legal. So you can sell this
actually a cocaine directly lidocaine.

2177
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:14,300
And um, how about uh, opiates? Morphine,

2178
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:16,790
yeah. And you know,
oxycontin's all that stuff.

2179
02:04:16,791 --> 02:04:18,290
Those are pills you could buy those you,

2180
02:04:18,370 --> 02:04:21,070
you can ask your doctor for
vicodins and they will give them to,

2181
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:24,350
if you're in pain, those
are drugs. Okay. And,

2182
02:04:24,351 --> 02:04:28,580
but the federal government can't stop
your doctor from prescribing those because

2183
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:29,690
they're scheduled to.

2184
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:34,960
So cocaine and heroin are both scheduled
to drugs because they have medical

2185
02:04:36,201 --> 02:04:39,960
applications, whereas they try to
pretend that marijuana doesn't,

2186
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:45,230
and that way they can stop
medical marijuana from
starting because it's a plant

2187
02:04:46,290 --> 02:04:49,380
as opposed to the slot coma and
things it helped. Doesn't matter.

2188
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:52,650
It doesn't matter. They've proved it
to the cows come home. It's not just,

2189
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,100
it's not,

2190
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:57,960
it's not based on like logic reason
or something being fair and ethical.

2191
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:59,940
It's based entirely on money,

2192
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:04,670
entirely on money and that's so there's
my argument, there's more money in in,

2193
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:08,130
in enforcing marijuana laws,
keeping people in jail than there is,

2194
02:05:08,131 --> 02:05:12,420
and I'll do you one better. There's an
economy based on enforcing marijuana laws.

2195
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:15,690
If marijuana is responsible,
and this is a true fact,

2196
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:20,900
was responsible for a large percentage
of people that are in federal prison,

2197
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,310
a large percent,

2198
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:26,790
more than 20% of all the people that
are in prison are in there because of

2199
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:30,240
marijuana. It's growing it or selling
it or whatever. If that's the case,

2200
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:31,800
all those people get out.

2201
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:35,850
All those people now would not
get put in prison in the future.

2202
02:05:35,851 --> 02:05:39,930
No one would get put in prison that did
those things and now and raise their own

2203
02:05:39,931 --> 02:05:42,840
children. Christians will shrink and
there'll be less people in the prisons.

2204
02:05:42,841 --> 02:05:46,770
There'll be less prison guards, prison,
prison guard unions do not want that.

2205
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:50,970
So prison guard unions
campaign and and and,

2206
02:05:50,971 --> 02:05:55,971
and use their money and their finances
to lobby heavily to make sure that

2207
02:05:56,311 --> 02:05:58,980
marijuana laws stay in place.
Once again,

2208
02:05:58,981 --> 02:06:03,750
an example of how Washington has become
an economy of influence. Once again,

2209
02:06:03,751 --> 02:06:05,400
why you gotta be,

2210
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:10,430
you gotta know how the system works and
and the injustices it creates when a

2211
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:14,730
special interest group can
affect other people's lives.

2212
02:06:14,731 --> 02:06:18,420
Because there's an economic advantage
in it. Even if it's an immoral,

2213
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:20,130
I don't think anybody
has an argument with it.

2214
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:22,830
The the argument with you
rather the argument is how,

2215
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:26,010
where the question rather it becomes
how do you stop that from happening?

2216
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:30,420
Take money out of politics.
Yeah, but who's a, you know,
there are ways to do it.

2217
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:32,430
There are ways to do it.
It's not easy.

2218
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:34,620
It's like taking that plastic
out of the bundle of the ocean.

2219
02:06:34,650 --> 02:06:38,040
It's essentially the same province unless
it has ideas and a lot of who the hell

2220
02:06:38,041 --> 02:06:40,550
is that guy and how, like how can
they kill him? His Mercedes, you know,

2221
02:06:40,551 --> 02:06:42,510
you're going to go right into a
tree at a hundred miles an hour.

2222
02:06:42,511 --> 02:06:46,800
Like Michael Hastings not hitting the
brakes. Right. Do you know about that? No.

2223
02:06:47,190 --> 02:06:51,090
You don't know about that? No. You don't
know about Michael Hastings now? Wow.

2224
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:53,640
You're a weird guy, man. You
know about some strange shit,

2225
02:06:53,641 --> 02:06:55,230
but you don't know about some things.

2226
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:58,130
Sometimes things are like
in the public consciousness,

2227
02:06:58,190 --> 02:07:03,060
yet completely blissfully unaware of
the Michael Hastings. Uh, conspiracy is,

2228
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:07,080
he's a journalist for the rolling stone.
33 years old, cocky fuck, you know,

2229
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:11,310
get getting people's faces on television
about generals and stuff about what

2230
02:07:11,311 --> 02:07:14,610
they're doing. And you guys are doing
this and that exposes a bunch of Shit.

2231
02:07:14,611 --> 02:07:18,300
Gets people in trouble. Is doing
an article about the CIA. Okay?

2232
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:21,330
His car drives into a tree.

2233
02:07:21,331 --> 02:07:25,020
This is after he told everybody the
FBI's investigating him and his family.

2234
02:07:25,021 --> 02:07:29,640
And you know, if anybody, you
know, uh, gets contacted by
the FBI, just get a lawyer.

2235
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:32,070
Like he's,
he's saying all this stuff like publicly,

2236
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:37,090
his car goes 100 miles an hour without
ever hitting the brakes right into a tree.

2237
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:41,170
Okay? He burst into flames and dies.
Okay. No, it doesn't hit the brakes.

2238
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:44,560
It's four o'clock in the morning.
Judge drives straight into a tree.

2239
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:48,430
They take his body cremated
against the wishes of his family.

2240
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:50,850
Then the, uh, the,

2241
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:55,780
the former security adviser think it
was the security advisor to Clinton and

2242
02:07:56,410 --> 02:07:58,430
Herbert Walker Bush.
Um,

2243
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:03,690
he comes out and says that it's
possible to take over a car,

2244
02:08:03,971 --> 02:08:05,320
a modern car today,

2245
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:09,910
including manipulate the steering cause
it's right here and the computers. Yes.

2246
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:13,760
So he says you can turn your car into
a drone, Jesus and remote control,

2247
02:08:13,761 --> 02:08:15,880
a cost and suicide,
someone with it.

2248
02:08:16,150 --> 02:08:21,150
And so this guy who is spending all
of his time and all of his effort,

2249
02:08:22,421 --> 02:08:23,560
very high profile,

2250
02:08:23,890 --> 02:08:28,570
trying to take out the people in the
world that are the best at killing people

2251
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:34,320
all of a sudden drives his car
100 miles an hour into a tree,

2252
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:36,130
doesn't hit the brakes once.

2253
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:41,340
And even people that aren't inclined to
subscribe to conspiracy theories just

2254
02:08:42,551 --> 02:08:46,560
go, wait a minute, what the fuck?
I've had some people that were there.

2255
02:08:46,690 --> 02:08:51,550
Very serious folks. Okay. And they've
sent me messages just saying, okay,

2256
02:08:51,551 --> 02:08:54,610
what the fuck is this? Like, I'm
not concerned about the Hastings.

2257
02:08:54,611 --> 02:08:59,140
So many people have written this message.
I'm not a conspiracy theorist,

2258
02:08:59,170 --> 02:09:02,410
but dot, dot, dot. And then sent me that.

2259
02:09:02,411 --> 02:09:06,540
I mean scholars like people that
I've met that are, you know,

2260
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:10,870
have PhDs and they're looking at
this and they're going, whoa, whoa,

2261
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:11,880
he's he.

2262
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:16,870
He exposed some crazy shit fetched to
believe that there are people in power

2263
02:09:16,871 --> 02:09:20,170
that will kill you if you're
threatening their position.

2264
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:23,650
It seems to me that's what
history would suggest,

2265
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:26,320
but it goes along the lines
of what we're talking about,

2266
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:30,490
how anonymous you can be about
what's possible. You know,

2267
02:09:30,491 --> 02:09:33,050
anybody at the NSA, I don't know
anybody. I don't know. Anyway,

2268
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:35,410
I don't know anything about this guy guys.
I don't know any,

2269
02:09:35,411 --> 02:09:39,370
I don't know one person, so you
know. Yeah. I believe that there are,

2270
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:44,050
there are probably people who could
manipulate a car. Yes, it can be done now.

2271
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:47,230
It's a family. Pretty wild. No,
it's a fact. It can be done.

2272
02:09:47,260 --> 02:09:51,280
I want to get that Tesla, by the way,
whether it's been done is not a fact,

2273
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:55,570
but it's a fact that it can be done.
There's absolutely, look at that.

2274
02:09:55,571 --> 02:09:59,560
Hacking a car is way too easy. These,
these guys who have looked at it,

2275
02:09:59,561 --> 02:10:00,790
it said that this is,
you know,

2276
02:10:00,791 --> 02:10:03,580
you're not talking about going past
faster than the speed of light.

2277
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:07,210
You're talking about something that
can be done. And not only that,

2278
02:10:07,211 --> 02:10:09,100
a guy came out with an iPhone application,

2279
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:14,050
a $25 iPhone application that can take
over your car. Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

2280
02:10:14,051 --> 02:10:14,440
Someone,

2281
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:18,670
someone came up with an application for
a cell phone that can take over a car he

2282
02:10:18,671 --> 02:10:20,530
needs.
One of the reasons why he talked about it,

2283
02:10:20,531 --> 02:10:24,420
because he wanted to let people know
like, hey look, I made this like you guys,

2284
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:28,480
look, I know that this is real.
Okay. I'm not trying to hurt anybody,

2285
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:30,700
but I want everybody to
know that this is possible.

2286
02:10:30,701 --> 02:10:33,720
Talk about being able to steal
a car really easily. Yeah. Well,

2287
02:10:33,721 --> 02:10:35,870
a car is a computer, you know, and again,

2288
02:10:35,871 --> 02:10:38,330
it sort of goes to what we were
talking about about one day.

2289
02:10:38,331 --> 02:10:40,460
There's going to be a point in
time where money's not real.

2290
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:43,070
There's also going to be a point in
time where objects aren't really there

2291
02:10:43,071 --> 02:10:45,440
because there are computers and you
gonna be able to control it all.

2292
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:49,130
It's like it's really amazing. I
never, I never thought of that.

2293
02:10:49,131 --> 02:10:52,360
I'm literally looking at that test lab.
Want to get that electric car crazy.

2294
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:54,570
So you should get an a 1970 Porsche.

2295
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:59,580
I know cause they're always
updating that car there.

2296
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:02,080
They're always downloading information
into it. That Tesla. Right.

2297
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:04,130
You want a car with a carburetor

2298
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:08,750
and that's just no anti Laos the gallon.
No,

2299
02:11:08,751 --> 02:11:12,020
the old Porsche's done but not as bad.
It's my car. What do you think of that?

2300
02:11:12,021 --> 02:11:16,640
You know a lot about cars. I
love Tesla. Well know the issue.

2301
02:11:16,641 --> 02:11:20,210
I mean yes or no. You can't have
it as a primary car. Your only car.

2302
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:23,600
That's when the shit hits
the fan. You're stuck. Okay.

2303
02:11:23,670 --> 02:11:27,260
Gasoline is going to exist for a while.
Okay.

2304
02:11:27,261 --> 02:11:31,280
Even if there's some sort of a
pandemic walking dead type scenario,

2305
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:34,910
you can be able to find, I haven't at
least have a gas pockets of gas. Yeah.

2306
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:38,870
But the issue with these cars
right now is two fold. One,

2307
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:41,810
there's not enough superstations
and what a superstition is,

2308
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:46,280
you can go there and in 10 minutes they
can charge it like 50% it's pretty bad

2309
02:11:46,281 --> 02:11:50,510
ass. It only takes like 10 minutes. The
other way to do it, I think it's like,

2310
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:53,780
I think it's within 30 minutes or an hour,

2311
02:11:53,781 --> 02:11:58,781
they get it up to like 90% but then to
get to that last the extra 10% it's quite

2312
02:11:59,031 --> 02:12:02,300
a bit more. It's a pain in
the deck, man. If you, if you,

2313
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:04,970
if you're just driving back and forth
and you know you're going to park it in

2314
02:12:04,971 --> 02:12:09,280
your house every night and
commute, it goes about 300
miles and that's good. Yeah,

2315
02:12:09,290 --> 02:12:13,280
that's fine. Like for la traffic during
the day, that's fine. It'll work.

2316
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:16,580
But if you want to go somewhere,
like if you want to go to Vegas,

2317
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:18,080
you might not make it.

2318
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:22,640
You're going to have to stop somewhere
along the line and charge your car and it

2319
02:12:22,641 --> 02:12:25,790
might take a half an hour. I'm getting
one cause I got to Vegas twice a year.

2320
02:12:25,791 --> 02:12:28,150
I'm getting the test. I mean,
if you're not in like a travel,

2321
02:12:28,151 --> 02:12:29,210
you're not going to go to Yosemite.

2322
02:12:29,211 --> 02:12:31,700
You're not going to drive up to San
Francisco. Yeah. Yeah. I get it.

2323
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:35,990
It's a beautiful car. It's a beautiful
car. I interviewed Martine Rothblatt.

2324
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:40,450
She um, is the, the woman who
she actually invented, um,

2325
02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:45,200
direct TV. She or I'm not directly
via XM radio, satellite radio. Wow.

2326
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:47,690
And uh, had, uh, one of those things,

2327
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:50,720
she remember those Tesla things
and I was like, Ooh, this is bad.

2328
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:51,853
It's like this thing.

2329
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:55,850
She's the one who there's a the in the
video for this new show that I'm doing.

2330
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:59,720
Um, uh, she has a robot
made of her spouse.

2331
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:01,370
It's called being a 48.

2332
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:05,780
Her wife's name is Beena and she has
this been a 48 robot that's a head that

2333
02:13:05,781 --> 02:13:06,614
talks to you.

2334
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:09,950
It's connected to a computer and you
talk to it and ask you questions and it

2335
02:13:09,951 --> 02:13:12,590
answers and responds and it's like,

2336
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:16,910
this is like one step further
than the last one that she had,

2337
02:13:16,911 --> 02:13:18,740
but just one step further than
the previous one. I was like,

2338
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:23,750
she's slowly but surely updating these
things until eventually it's a real robot.

2339
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:27,920
Like eventually it's not just
going to be a robot of her spouse,

2340
02:13:27,921 --> 02:13:32,610
it's going to be hers, her
spouse, if destiny, this a,
it's, it's an inevitability,

2341
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:37,080
but she had that debt. Bad Ass Tesla,
Tesla. Yeah. I, I'm, I want to get that.

2342
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:39,180
It's a wicked car, man. It's fast too.

2343
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:42,510
It's weird fast because it all
is like immediate and instant.

2344
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:44,160
It's like there's no gears.

2345
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:47,070
How long until the other car companies
come along and have their version of the

2346
02:13:47,071 --> 02:13:49,740
test because they, I think it's
selling really well. Pretty okay.

2347
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:51,720
Pretty sure you did.
It would for sure.

2348
02:13:51,810 --> 02:13:55,140
What Tesla figured out was how to make a
car that's electric doesn't look like a

2349
02:13:55,141 --> 02:13:59,250
piece of shit. There were the first
ones with that. A bad ass car.

2350
02:13:59,251 --> 02:14:01,790
I'm not even in cars. You know
me, I drive the lame his cars.

2351
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:05,170
I actually want one well that that
sports car, they have to, his wish.

2352
02:14:05,490 --> 02:14:06,323
That thing is fast,

2353
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:10,140
but it's really rear weight bias because
of all the lithium ion batteries and

2354
02:14:10,141 --> 02:14:12,840
the trunk. There's a lot of
weight in the rear. That's that,

2355
02:14:12,841 --> 02:14:15,330
that write that sentence right there.
As a guy who knows cars,

2356
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:18,600
it's very way by a set of lithium battery.
I'm like, all right. Yeah. All right.

2357
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:22,380
Well, you know Porsche is
or rear by balanced. Um,

2358
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:24,660
for the most part except for
the Cayman's and Boxsters,

2359
02:14:24,661 --> 02:14:27,630
which are actually the better design
cars if they're there in a really tricky

2360
02:14:27,631 --> 02:14:31,920
situation because the nine 11 since the
beginning when they first designed it,

2361
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:35,130
they designed it with an engine that's
hung out behind the rear wheels.

2362
02:14:35,131 --> 02:14:37,020
Nobody else does that.
There's not another car that does that.

2363
02:14:37,021 --> 02:14:39,120
Everybody else does either
a mid engine format,

2364
02:14:39,121 --> 02:14:42,750
which means that the engine is on front
of the wheels or means it's in front of

2365
02:14:42,751 --> 02:14:45,650
the front wheels. Yeah. Which allows,
you know the weight in the front.

2366
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:49,350
That's a good 50 50 distribution way.
The, we have the the front engine car.

2367
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:53,250
That's why I like the Lexus Lfa. That's
super fast, crazy hyped up Lexus.

2368
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:56,790
That was a front engine car. The Corvette
Zr one that's a front engine car,

2369
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:01,200
but a lot of the exotics, like
Ferrari mid engine, the Nsx,

2370
02:15:01,201 --> 02:15:04,560
the Acura Nsx, that was a mid
engine car for for balance issues,

2371
02:15:04,561 --> 02:15:05,850
just like the Cayman and the Boxster.

2372
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:08,220
But Porsche keeps their
engine now back still,

2373
02:15:08,221 --> 02:15:11,820
so they have to like engineer all
these ways to avoid what's called lift

2374
02:15:11,821 --> 02:15:15,570
throttle oversteer because of the fact
that you have this weight in the back as

2375
02:15:15,571 --> 02:15:17,760
you're going around a corner,
if you let off the brakes,

2376
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:22,320
your front end comes up and then
the asin goes forward, spins.

2377
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:26,010
So you have to keep the front end down
so you have to keep accelerating into a

2378
02:15:26,011 --> 02:15:30,350
corner because you've got this massive
pendulum behind you because if you know

2379
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:33,120
how to use it, it's wicked. Yeah.
So if you know how to use it,

2380
02:15:33,121 --> 02:15:35,310
you actually know how to
accelerate our corners better.

2381
02:15:35,311 --> 02:15:37,770
You know how to judge it and gauge it,

2382
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:41,550
but not in that fucking Tesla.
Okay,

2383
02:15:41,551 --> 02:15:45,540
you got a bunch of batteries back then
we'll scas tires. It doesn't have like,

2384
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:48,660
you know, like if you look at a
Porsche like that, my gt three, the Rs,

2385
02:15:48,700 --> 02:15:52,840
those tires are like 15
inches. Why they're fucking
giant in the back. That is,

2386
02:15:52,841 --> 02:15:55,680
I read that right? That Cory, how about
that? It's a race car. Yeah it is.

2387
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:59,880
But that's the point is like it's designed
and knows how to deal with this rear

2388
02:15:59,881 --> 02:16:03,030
weight. I don't think the Tesla
has that sporty as far as like,

2389
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:06,630
I think there's actually been tests. I
think Chris Harris was one of my favorite,

2390
02:16:06,631 --> 02:16:11,280
uh, automotive journalist does a lot of
cool videos on cars. They took a test,

2391
02:16:11,281 --> 02:16:14,720
so around a track and I was like sliding
all over the place. Yeah. Well I don't,

2392
02:16:14,730 --> 02:16:16,110
I don't try. I mean, what are you doing?

2393
02:16:16,111 --> 02:16:18,090
You going on and track or are
you just driving it around town?

2394
02:16:18,091 --> 02:16:20,550
It's going to drive around and
you're not even looking at that one.

2395
02:16:20,551 --> 02:16:23,680
You're not looking at the little little
sports car one, looking at the big one.

2396
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:28,560
The big ones. Beautiful. Yeah, but there's
only them. And then there's the Karma,

2397
02:16:28,770 --> 02:16:31,770
the Fisker Karma. But I think they went
out of business. I think they did. Yeah.

2398
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:35,110
Do you know what happened
with them? No. Listen to this.

2399
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:37,090
They had a gang of them parked,
uh,

2400
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:42,120
on the docks when hurricane sandy hit
and the water came up really high and it

2401
02:16:43,631 --> 02:16:45,430
flooded the docs.

2402
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:50,170
And so these cars got
flooded and they exploded.

2403
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:54,730
They started exploding
and then they realize, oh,

2404
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:59,760
you just got this massive electrical
power source and a water gets on it and it

2405
02:17:01,001 --> 02:17:05,680
explodes. Good thing we found out that
hurricane sandy may cause I can see it.

2406
02:17:05,681 --> 02:17:09,180
I'm trying [inaudible] water.
Yeah.

2407
02:17:09,530 --> 02:17:12,400
You can be driving through standing
water in your fucking car would explode.

2408
02:17:12,401 --> 02:17:15,780
Look at that. Those are those cars
they burnt to the ground. Yeah.

2409
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:16,930
They exploded in bursts.

2410
02:17:16,930 --> 02:17:19,570
I think it was like 15 cars
or something crazy like that.

2411
02:17:19,571 --> 02:17:23,110
Does it say in the article how many cars?
They lost a shit load of them.

2412
02:17:23,290 --> 02:17:27,700
They all got wet and exploded. I
haven't, I, speaking of explosive,

2413
02:17:27,701 --> 02:17:31,660
watch how I might watch. I changed the
explosive new show coming out. No, no,

2414
02:17:31,661 --> 02:17:35,920
not that I will be at the Schomburg
again, Bro. No. But here's my question.

2415
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:40,630
I'm Rory Macdonald. Uh, Jake Allen
versus weekend sign. What's your call?

2416
02:17:41,290 --> 02:17:45,730
Chaos. That's my call. Who the hell knows?
Wicked. There's those are two pit bulls,

2417
02:17:45,731 --> 02:17:48,370
man. Yeah, those are
two elite of the elite.

2418
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:52,090
Ellenberger has a lot more experience
with high level competition though.

2419
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:57,100
He's soft. He's fun named mark or all
kinds of guys. Knock Nate Marquardt silly,

2420
02:17:57,350 --> 02:18:01,840
you know, I mean he's a beast. Jake
Ellenberger is a fucking beast.

2421
02:18:01,870 --> 02:18:05,680
Knocked out Jake shields.
Ellenberger is a motherfucker man.

2422
02:18:05,681 --> 02:18:08,560
He hits hard.
He's fast as shit.

2423
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:11,830
And the way he took on Nate Marquardt
opened up a lot of people's eyes.

2424
02:18:11,831 --> 02:18:15,880
He's real dangerous. How did he do
that? I mean it made sense. A question.

2425
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:20,410
Real good question. Especially when
you look at Nate's previous fight,

2426
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:22,810
while the previous fight
was not a good one,

2427
02:18:22,811 --> 02:18:25,750
he fought Terex Avidyne and
lost his title. Got Leg kicked,

2428
02:18:26,310 --> 02:18:29,530
70 just leg kicked the shit out of him.
I don't think he had fought real smart.

2429
02:18:29,531 --> 02:18:32,170
He didn't plan for that or
something, you know. Well I think,

2430
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:34,450
I don't think you can take
it away from Saffadi Dean.

2431
02:18:34,451 --> 02:18:38,410
Cause I think he fought the worst case
scenario fight when you fighting like a

2432
02:18:38,411 --> 02:18:42,970
really what staffing is,
is a very technical kickboxer.

2433
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:46,330
He's very technical.
He does things the right way.

2434
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:49,720
Marquardt is athletic and
powerful and explosive.

2435
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:54,440
But no disrespect his camp,
I don't think he's trained in the,

2436
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:59,240
like the technical level of [inaudible]
70 was like a real professional kickbox

2437
02:18:59,241 --> 02:18:59,740
right.

2438
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:04,740
And his Moitai his like his kickboxing
is very much on point and if you think

2439
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:07,420
you could eat leg kicks from a
guy like that, you're mistaken.

2440
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:11,170
And there's a lot of guys that are real
good that especially mark hard coming

2441
02:19:11,171 --> 02:19:15,100
off of that fight with Tyron Woodley and
Tyron Woodley's a motherfucker, right?

2442
02:19:15,101 --> 02:19:19,750
So he knocks out Tyron Woodley with this
video game combination of punches that

2443
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:22,000
looks just spectacular.
He's on top of the world.

2444
02:19:22,001 --> 02:19:25,060
He thinks he's the crusher at one seven
he's going to beat everyone's ass.

2445
02:19:25,061 --> 02:19:26,760
And how Safford ain't gonna fuck with him.
Sure.

2446
02:19:27,050 --> 02:19:31,000
[inaudible] just starts kicking that leg
man. Slowly but surely. I mean when he,

2447
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:35,040
when he fought Jose Aldo,
I'm are watching and I was there for,

2448
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:36,440
actually I think I watched on,

2449
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:40,540
we did stand up that night and I watched
Frankie Edgar get kicked a couple of

2450
02:19:40,550 --> 02:19:43,160
times by that crazy Jose Aldo leg kick.

2451
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:46,730
And guess what he did the third
time he dove into a double leg,

2452
02:19:46,970 --> 02:19:49,820
literally dove into that
like no hesitation is like,

2453
02:19:49,821 --> 02:19:53,450
oh you want to sound like Wayne and
then guess what Jose Aldo stopped leg

2454
02:19:53,451 --> 02:19:55,040
kicking him.
I couldn't believe that.

2455
02:19:55,041 --> 02:19:58,010
That's when I looked at Frankie
at your house. Like you are a,

2456
02:19:58,250 --> 02:20:01,820
you're such a Badass that
you took that leg kick away.

2457
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:05,270
Cause Jose Aldo ruins careers
with that fun. He does. Yeah.

2458
02:20:05,271 --> 02:20:08,130
If you stand in front of them and
that's some, well it's, you know what?

2459
02:20:08,140 --> 02:20:12,590
It's the evolution of the sport. People
realizing that people use to old shit.

2460
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:15,830
You know that was one of the number one
criticisms that are get from people that

2461
02:20:15,831 --> 02:20:18,380
I bring up. Leg kicks too much.
Like why hasn't he leg kicking?

2462
02:20:18,381 --> 02:20:19,730
Why does he led kicking?
I was like,

2463
02:20:19,731 --> 02:20:23,000
well this cause you've never
been leg kicked if you've
been leg kicked correctly.

2464
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:27,740
Like we're starting to see it slowly
but surely all these various techniques

2465
02:20:27,890 --> 02:20:31,970
entering into MMA, like we didn't see
nearly as many head kicks in the past.

2466
02:20:31,971 --> 02:20:34,340
Like the early days it was very rare,

2467
02:20:34,430 --> 02:20:36,830
but now people will kick your
people and knocking people out.

2468
02:20:36,831 --> 02:20:40,250
This is stuff that I've been calling for
for like the longest time and it's not

2469
02:20:40,251 --> 02:20:42,430
because I'm just,
you know,

2470
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:46,520
looking for some unrealistic
aspect of the sport to emerge. No,

2471
02:20:46,521 --> 02:20:48,230
it's because they're super effective.

2472
02:20:48,350 --> 02:20:51,650
So we get like gone like Aldo that shows
that like in the fight with your riot

2473
02:20:51,651 --> 02:20:53,890
faber, perfect example, Uriah Faber,

2474
02:20:53,970 --> 02:20:58,800
if you never followed it for like
weeks after that fight, he was fucked.

2475
02:20:58,801 --> 02:21:02,990
I talked to leg was twice the
size. He said, he told me, he said,

2476
02:21:02,991 --> 02:21:06,620
I thought I was going to faint.
It was so, it hurts so badly.

2477
02:21:06,621 --> 02:21:10,160
I thought it was going to faint in the
ring. And that's an the, I'm sorry, tough.

2478
02:21:10,161 --> 02:21:12,980
I'm if I'm, if I'm, yeah,
he's so tough. He's an animal.

2479
02:21:12,981 --> 02:21:15,060
I don't know if that's exactly what
I said. We talk about it and that's,

2480
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:17,750
I think he used the word faint
and I was like, that's, that's a,

2481
02:21:17,751 --> 02:21:20,750
that's a warrior that a lot
of people would have quit

2482
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:26,720
flavor. By the way, I make an
argument. He broke both his hands on,

2483
02:21:26,870 --> 02:21:31,850
on Mike Brown's head and kept fighting
and was using his by the top second

2484
02:21:31,851 --> 02:21:35,630
round. He's the toughest son of a bitch.
He had a fight three rounds, three,

2485
02:21:35,631 --> 02:21:38,790
four and five with two broken hands.
He's a beast.

2486
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:42,890
And Mike Brown's a fucking beast.
Imagine being stuck in that guy.

2487
02:21:42,891 --> 02:21:46,400
This is after the guy knocks you senseless
and takes your title in the previous

2488
02:21:46,401 --> 02:21:49,610
fight and then you got to fight the next
fight with him with two broken hands.

2489
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:53,050
Good luck. Yeah, good luck.
It's a tough man sport, but so,

2490
02:21:53,051 --> 02:21:57,320
so Ellenberg Ellenberger and, and
it's look groin. Mcdonald's. I'm sad.

2491
02:21:57,330 --> 02:22:01,220
And why the fuck dude? He's a bad
motherfucker. He's super technical.

2492
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:05,560
He's super technical and driven
and he's psycho. He is, isn't here.

2493
02:22:05,570 --> 02:22:08,120
Roy McDonald definitely has a screw loose.

2494
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:12,770
He gets in this case and he just
stares. He's just, he's just real man.

2495
02:22:12,771 --> 02:22:15,440
That's what he is. He's the real
deal. He's a fucking killer.

2496
02:22:15,441 --> 02:22:17,480
He's coming to get you. He's not, yeah,

2497
02:22:17,490 --> 02:22:20,750
they ain't playing no games in and
he might not get you if you know,

2498
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:24,140
you might be able to get him,
but he's gonna he's gonna get better.

2499
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:25,033
If you do get him,

2500
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:27,750
he's going to go back to the drawing
board and come back better. I mean,

2501
02:22:27,751 --> 02:22:28,710
he's been gotten before,

2502
02:22:28,711 --> 02:22:32,400
but I liked Carlos condit called conduit
beat him and stopped him when he was

2503
02:22:32,401 --> 02:22:36,030
younger. And guess what? He came back
after that and was even scarier, you know,

2504
02:22:36,031 --> 02:22:37,790
and he calls out Carlos
condit was like his,

2505
02:22:37,791 --> 02:22:40,530
his lips are trembling and shit when
he talks about conduct and you're like,

2506
02:22:40,531 --> 02:22:44,910
oh Jesus, like that's another guy.
I have tremendous respect for.

2507
02:22:44,911 --> 02:22:47,460
Carl Carlos continent. He's a
beast. I think he's so good.

2508
02:22:47,461 --> 02:22:51,180
He's so good that George Saint
Pierre fight man, he almost got him.

2509
02:22:51,181 --> 02:22:55,230
He was never head kick. He never loses
his composure. Man Con it is very special.

2510
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:57,960
He's tough as shit. Tough as
nails. And he's always in shape,

2511
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:02,580
like five round conditioning shape.
Kids just started built like a tennis pro.

2512
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:05,970
Yeah. He's not like the most athletic guy,
you know. He doesn't move the quickest.

2513
02:23:05,971 --> 02:23:08,820
He's doesn't have the most power.
You know, he's just an animal smart.

2514
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:12,510
He's a smart, smart fighter. Never
loses his cool, tough as shit.

2515
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:14,950
But there Roy McDonald kid a Katz,

2516
02:23:15,330 --> 02:23:19,890
he's no joke there as the first time he's
fought a guy like Ellenberger though.

2517
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:24,240
I mean, you gotta think he beat the most
impressive victories of risk career,

2518
02:23:24,241 --> 02:23:28,140
whether it's a Nate Diaz.
Nate is essentially 155 pounder.

2519
02:23:28,470 --> 02:23:32,460
Or Bj Penn. Bj Penn was hung
out. Just 155 pounder. No,

2520
02:23:32,461 --> 02:23:34,800
he's the one 55 he was the one
that you've had a champion. I know.

2521
02:23:34,801 --> 02:23:37,830
Hard time probably suck.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2522
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:41,340
He had a hard time making one 55 was,
that's why I stopped doing it.

2523
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:43,920
It's why he went up to
one 70 but I mean he's,

2524
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:46,650
these guys are nothing
compared to Ellenberger.

2525
02:23:46,890 --> 02:23:51,210
Ellenberger is a legit one 70 and
he's a crusher. He's a scary one.

2526
02:23:51,211 --> 02:23:54,450
70 he's the one 70 and it puts you
guys in la La land with one punch.

2527
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:57,850
So it's a really interesting fight.
Very interesting and a lot.

2528
02:23:57,900 --> 02:24:01,950
What's really crazy is although
Ellenberger has definitely fought like the

2529
02:24:01,951 --> 02:24:03,450
higher competition at one 70,

2530
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:07,020
Rory is actually ranked higher than
him by a lot of people. And uh,

2531
02:24:07,050 --> 02:24:10,260
is the favorite coming into this
fight just based on talent alone,

2532
02:24:10,470 --> 02:24:14,680
based on people watching them take apart
guys like chain mail is take apart Bj

2533
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:20,160
like GSPs training partner and I believe
not anymore, but I was going to say,

2534
02:24:20,161 --> 02:24:23,040
correct me if I'm wrong, he said he
would fight GSP I believe. Right?

2535
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:26,230
I think they stopped training together.
I daws yeah,

2536
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:30,210
because he kind of alluded to the fact
that he would be willing to fight you.

2537
02:24:30,211 --> 02:24:33,930
I shouldn't say this until I'm, I talked
to both of them. Are either one of them,

2538
02:24:33,931 --> 02:24:35,100
cause I haven't talked to him about this,

2539
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:38,100
but what I've read recently is that he's
been training and like the other side

2540
02:24:38,101 --> 02:24:39,900
of the gym is that like,
you know,

2541
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:42,360
they realize that eventually
they're going to find if this,

2542
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:43,770
I mean it doesn't want to,
you know,

2543
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:46,980
but eventually he said there's two guys
you wouldn't fight GSP and Weidman.

2544
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:49,020
Chris Weidman is also,
they're trained together.

2545
02:24:49,610 --> 02:24:52,410
There's a video of a Rory and
Weidman training together. But,

2546
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:56,110
but who knows if that's even true.
I think weapons bigger isn't it?

2547
02:24:57,390 --> 02:25:00,120
I mean just this frame and
everything and not that much bigger.

2548
02:25:00,121 --> 02:25:02,640
You watch the two of them spar together.
It's kind of shocking. Really. Roy,

2549
02:25:02,650 --> 02:25:04,540
he's a big kid. He's
a big kid. I think he,

2550
02:25:04,541 --> 02:25:08,580
I mean he's walks around over 200 pounds
for it starts as cut when he gets down

2551
02:25:08,581 --> 02:25:12,690
to one 70 he does it like,
you know he's won 70 he's fucking shred.

2552
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:17,160
I have a question cause I've,
I've seen this guy trained Hector lumbar,

2553
02:25:17,161 --> 02:25:20,610
it's going to suck down to one 70 what
are you talking about? No, it's not a,

2554
02:25:20,611 --> 02:25:22,590
what are you talking about at all?
How is he going to do that?

2555
02:25:22,591 --> 02:25:27,550
So are you talking about he's not, he's
five seven. He's thick. He's muscular.

2556
02:25:27,551 --> 02:25:29,940
But by the way, it should have been
fighting at one seventies entire career.

2557
02:25:29,941 --> 02:25:30,590
Really?
Yeah,

2558
02:25:30,590 --> 02:25:35,590
100% when you see a guy that is competing
in a smaller organization and crushing

2559
02:25:36,551 --> 02:25:40,660
people and then you see him fight in the
UFC and you see him start losing and he

2560
02:25:40,661 --> 02:25:43,950
gets out muscled by big guys like
Tim Boetsch and you, you know,

2561
02:25:43,951 --> 02:25:47,920
I realize that he's losing the
tuition Okami and you go, oh,

2562
02:25:47,921 --> 02:25:50,590
I see what's going on. You don't
belong in that weight class. Wow.

2563
02:25:50,620 --> 02:25:53,410
Like you're too small for that weight
class. That's so shocking to me.

2564
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:55,750
It gives me so much more respect.
I've seen him training.

2565
02:25:55,751 --> 02:25:58,840
I was down in age is an animal. He's
the biggest, thickest guy. I mean,

2566
02:25:58,841 --> 02:26:01,990
I looked at him, no, no, no, before I knew
him. Anyway. You're saying crazy talk.

2567
02:26:01,991 --> 02:26:06,460
He's one. He's five seven. That's 170
pound man's friend. He's a fit guy.

2568
02:26:06,461 --> 02:26:07,360
If you're that Short,

2569
02:26:07,361 --> 02:26:10,750
I guess you have to suck down because
you don't have the length. When you talk,

2570
02:26:10,751 --> 02:26:14,710
look, look at his build and that
by the what in other, by the way,

2571
02:26:15,020 --> 02:26:19,000
another problem with a build like
that is it makes for explosive power.

2572
02:26:19,001 --> 02:26:23,430
No doubt about it,
but all that muscle requires fuel you.

2573
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:27,760
You really shouldn't have that much
builder muscle on your body because as a

2574
02:26:27,761 --> 02:26:31,060
fighter that's not helping you.
It's not.

2575
02:26:31,090 --> 02:26:33,100
It's that that stuff's weighing you down.

2576
02:26:33,101 --> 02:26:37,810
It's causing you to have this massive
engine that you have to fuel three round

2577
02:26:37,811 --> 02:26:42,220
or five round fight, five
rounders, especially five for
five rounds. Five meg ones.

2578
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:46,330
Yeah. If you look at the best fighters,
like the high level five round guys,

2579
02:26:46,610 --> 02:26:48,640
they're there. They're in good
shape, they're in great shape,

2580
02:26:48,641 --> 02:26:52,360
but they never have that
level of musculature. I mean,
he's a thick fucking God.

2581
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:55,150
He's going to fight and mark core.
That's going to be crazy.

2582
02:26:55,151 --> 02:26:56,400
If I can't wait to see,
well,

2583
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:58,600
it's going to be interesting to
see how he deals with the cut.

2584
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:01,690
It's probably be a reasonable,
I fought at one 85 and one of the,

2585
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:03,280
some of the reasons some people just,

2586
02:27:03,490 --> 02:27:07,360
they don't perform well when
they're dieting. They don't
perform art. It's also,

2587
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:10,540
it kills your confidence and training.
You start losing weight,

2588
02:27:10,570 --> 02:27:14,020
you start feeling weaker, you start
feeling like shit you want to eat,

2589
02:27:14,021 --> 02:27:17,020
you want to say fucking I'm going back up.
But one 85 you know,

2590
02:27:17,021 --> 02:27:19,420
and it depends on how much weight
is he going to actually cut.

2591
02:27:19,421 --> 02:27:20,800
And as he'd done it before,

2592
02:27:20,980 --> 02:27:24,250
has he ever cut a shitload of weight
right before a fight before, you know,

2593
02:27:24,251 --> 02:27:27,640
cause a lot of these guys, the week of
the fight, they're cutting like 20 pounds.

2594
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:30,440
Right? And a lot of it's [inaudible]
the shit out of themselves.

2595
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:35,140
They feel terrible. They live it to like
some of them black out in the back room.

2596
02:27:35,430 --> 02:27:39,670
Like we've seen guys that like they had
to get the flight canceled because they,

2597
02:27:39,700 --> 02:27:43,060
they cut too much weight and then they're
like fucking fall down and bang their

2598
02:27:43,061 --> 02:27:45,820
head when they're, when they're out
back there talking to the doctor.

2599
02:27:45,821 --> 02:27:46,730
It's not just happen.

2600
02:27:46,731 --> 02:27:50,980
Once you like the idea of someone
like being really sick before a fight.

2601
02:27:50,981 --> 02:27:52,360
It's happened many times,
right?

2602
02:27:52,570 --> 02:27:56,500
Like 24 hours before you're supposed to
go into a cage and throw kicks at each

2603
02:27:56,501 --> 02:28:00,130
other and you can't even walk,
you know that's people's lungs collapse.

2604
02:28:00,131 --> 02:28:03,790
All kinds of weird crazy shit. Yeah.
That happened to Rory. Mark, I'm sorry.

2605
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:04,980
Mark Marcum,

2606
02:28:04,990 --> 02:28:09,990
when he fought Dan hard try to get
down to one 70 he was a big boy too.

2607
02:28:11,050 --> 02:28:16,050
Big Country Fed five foot 11
and a half fucking gorillas try.

2608
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:20,080
I remember Pat Miletich introduced me
to them once a long time ago at the hard

2609
02:28:20,081 --> 02:28:24,350
rock and like this is my best new up and
coming one 70 I was like one 70 yeah.

2610
02:28:24,430 --> 02:28:28,580
How has that guy won 70 that's
a football player. Yeah.

2611
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:31,220
Well how about Anthony
Rumble Johnson sucking down.

2612
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:35,660
I did a movie with a fighting heavyweight
now walking around at two 30 and the

2613
02:28:35,661 --> 02:28:38,570
set of warrior, I was like, you're going
to suck down to what? What did you say?

2614
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:42,350
Well, he fought Arlovski beat our Alaska
as a heavyweight. Yes, he did. Oh my God.

2615
02:28:42,351 --> 02:28:45,590
I almost knocked him out in the first
round. Wow. Sad. Arlovski's staggered,

2616
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:46,371
broke his jaw,

2617
02:28:46,371 --> 02:28:50,210
had him all fucked up and the first
room and Arlovski managed to hang on and

2618
02:28:50,211 --> 02:28:53,720
lose a decision. I have, that's the one
thing about when I watched her last scan,

2619
02:28:53,721 --> 02:28:57,170
how athletic it was.
He ultimately didn't seem to have the,

2620
02:28:57,171 --> 02:29:00,230
he didn't really become the UFC fighter.

2621
02:29:00,231 --> 02:29:03,830
He was supposed people thought
he was going to be, um,

2622
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:06,950
well he was the champion.
I mean,

2623
02:29:06,951 --> 02:29:10,990
at one point in time he's just scariest
guy in the planet and our, you know,

2624
02:29:11,310 --> 02:29:15,830
he was knocking people out with one
punch, but then he lost it. Tim Silvia.

2625
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:18,070
And then he came back and they,
you know,

2626
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:22,700
they fought again and Sylvia beat
him again. It's like, they're like,

2627
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:27,950
it's one of those things where you could
only stay at the top for so long and

2628
02:29:27,951 --> 02:29:32,270
then it's the top in relationship
to where the sport is at the moment.

2629
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:36,350
So in, in that moment when our Alaska
was the UFC heavyweight champion,

2630
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:38,630
that's where the sport
was with a sport was,

2631
02:29:38,631 --> 02:29:43,631
was it was at this spot where this guy
who was this big super fast athletic

2632
02:29:44,210 --> 02:29:49,210
kickboxer with lightning lightning quick
reflexes was knocking guys like Paul

2633
02:29:49,431 --> 02:29:53,900
boy and tello silly, you know, he was
knocking guys silly as a heavyweight.

2634
02:29:54,050 --> 02:29:58,400
He was a super athlete and he was
really like moved really well.

2635
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:01,340
But I started getting tagged,

2636
02:30:01,410 --> 02:30:06,350
he's lost a few by Kao and then he loses
his confidence and he's sorta getting

2637
02:30:06,351 --> 02:30:08,000
code on a regular basis.

2638
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:12,500
He gets cared by fate or he gets
carried by a couple of other guys,

2639
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:15,980
including guys that he's supposed
to beat. And you know, it becomes a,

2640
02:30:15,981 --> 02:30:18,650
it becomes a real problem with
confidence and everything else. Yeah.

2641
02:30:18,651 --> 02:30:22,580
Brett Rogers Kaos him and like the first
30 seconds of their fight just storms

2642
02:30:22,581 --> 02:30:27,200
after Maceio some, you know, it's like
he had like a real series of problems.

2643
02:30:27,350 --> 02:30:30,650
He was fighting fader
and was like going fight,

2644
02:30:30,680 --> 02:30:34,520
punch for punch with fade or for most of
the first round and then tries as crazy

2645
02:30:34,521 --> 02:30:38,630
flying knees. Leon. Yeah. That
felt like a lack of confidence.

2646
02:30:38,631 --> 02:30:41,450
Like he tried to rush the fight, you
know, jumping into that, I don't know.

2647
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:44,390
It's a lack of confidence.
I think he just did something stupid.

2648
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:46,850
He just got crazy and he didn't,

2649
02:30:46,851 --> 02:30:49,790
didn't respect the guys power
or he just took a while chance.

2650
02:30:49,791 --> 02:30:53,710
Sometimes people take wild chances as Jon
Jones going to go to a heavyweight, uh,

2651
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:57,410
he doesn't have to, he can fight it. Two
Oh five he can, he makes two oh five.

2652
02:30:57,740 --> 02:30:59,540
I mean,
I think he's a big kid.

2653
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:03,290
I think one day he's probably going
to be the heavyweight, you know,

2654
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:06,500
shouldn't say heavyweight champion.
I should say a heck.

2655
02:31:06,501 --> 02:31:08,240
I get through Cain Velasquez
and some other guys.

2656
02:31:08,241 --> 02:31:10,370
He's going to have to be a
heavy and stuff like that.

2657
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:14,750
But it'll also be interesting when you
see him fight as a heavyweight because

2658
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:15,321
you know,

2659
02:31:15,321 --> 02:31:20,321
how will he do against a really big guy
that's naturally larger than him that

2660
02:31:22,290 --> 02:31:25,920
that could never fight at two oh five
with and there are those guys like,

2661
02:31:26,370 --> 02:31:30,630
you know, like Shane Collins is a perfect
example. Shankar fight and two oh five.

2662
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:35,700
Okay. He's got fucking cinder blocks
because he calls hands Colin. He's all,

2663
02:31:35,701 --> 02:31:39,300
his bones are giant thick. He's like
an ogre dude. You know, it's like,

2664
02:31:39,301 --> 02:31:43,470
that's how he's built. He's
a giant motherfucker, you
know, even when he's lean,

2665
02:31:43,650 --> 02:31:48,000
he's like two 50, something like that.
And there's a big fucking bone guy.

2666
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:52,840
It was two 85 I was hanging out with them
on the, the ultimate fighter is to 85.

2667
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:57,400
Yeah, but when you've seen them, you're,
you're seeing him after years of football.

2668
02:31:57,410 --> 02:31:58,400
Like there's a picture of him,

2669
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:02,180
you're seeing them after years of flip
all he had like serious back injuries,

2670
02:32:02,181 --> 02:32:04,790
man, he had a, he had
a couple of surgeries.

2671
02:32:04,791 --> 02:32:09,770
He to retire on a podcast stenosis
and a stenosis is a short,

2672
02:32:09,810 --> 02:32:13,400
this, the, the, uh, the
canal where the nerves are,

2673
02:32:13,401 --> 02:32:17,810
starts getting impinged and the disc
start degrading and you start like getting

2674
02:32:17,811 --> 02:32:22,760
numbness and serious, serious
issue for a, for combat athletes,

2675
02:32:22,761 --> 02:32:23,221
if you,

2676
02:32:23,221 --> 02:32:27,320
you'd taken a lot of shots and you're
starting your disc start degenerating and

2677
02:32:27,321 --> 02:32:30,740
you start getting numbness and losing.
That's Bas Rutten's issue as well.

2678
02:32:30,741 --> 02:32:34,640
It's why he's had two neck surgeries and
it's why he has one arm. It's atrophied.

2679
02:32:34,670 --> 02:32:39,260
It's all the nerves. The nerves are
getting impacted, they're getting smushed,

2680
02:32:39,261 --> 02:32:42,290
they're getting cutoff is nothing they
can do. Oh, that's a fucking huge problem.

2681
02:32:42,291 --> 02:32:43,790
You could have surgeries and shed.
I mean,

2682
02:32:43,791 --> 02:32:47,840
people have surgeries where they try to
do at AU naturale they try to do it with

2683
02:32:47,841 --> 02:32:51,710
yoga and stretching and try to,
but the cat fight during that time,

2684
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:54,980
you have to retire, you have to
retire and you have to stop fighting.

2685
02:32:54,981 --> 02:32:58,550
And you know,
I think means Carlin's got a family and a,

2686
02:32:58,551 --> 02:33:01,640
I talked to him after his last surgery.

2687
02:33:01,641 --> 02:33:04,640
Which about the one,
I don't know if he's had one sense,

2688
02:33:04,641 --> 02:33:06,440
but the last surgery
I talked to him about,

2689
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:08,600
it was like about a year
and a half ago. It was, no,

2690
02:33:08,601 --> 02:33:11,870
it was a little over a year ago
because it was at the UFC expo,

2691
02:33:11,871 --> 02:33:15,250
which just happened last
couple of weeks ago. And, uh,

2692
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:17,210
he had just gotten out of
the surgery and he's like,

2693
02:33:17,211 --> 02:33:19,850
I don't know when I'm going to be able to
fight again. You know, I'm in training,

2694
02:33:19,851 --> 02:33:22,490
I'm trying, I'm trying to get it
together. He's like, but it's hard.

2695
02:33:22,590 --> 02:33:27,330
Well, I just talked to him,
um, recently, um, and he, he,

2696
02:33:27,331 --> 02:33:30,140
uh, about, uh, actually a
week ago and he, um, you know,

2697
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:33,990
he's just adjusting to retirement. It's
really hard for a guy like that who is,

2698
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:34,350
you know,

2699
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:38,210
King of the beasts to have to retire
and you've got a lot to go back to.

2700
02:33:38,230 --> 02:33:41,140
He's got a family, he's electrical
engineer. He's got a career. But he,

2701
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:41,851
when I talked to him,
he was,

2702
02:33:41,851 --> 02:33:44,810
I'm an oil field and he was looking around
and they was doing some work. And, uh,

2703
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:48,840
it's, it's, it's a big transition, a
big emotional transition for, for Shane,

2704
02:33:49,140 --> 02:33:49,770
you know?

2705
02:33:49,770 --> 02:33:53,580
Yeah. Well it has to man.
It, you know, it has to be,

2706
02:33:53,581 --> 02:33:54,930
it's really difficult to do,

2707
02:33:54,931 --> 02:33:58,860
to transition from anything where you're
a professional athlete with a finite

2708
02:33:58,861 --> 02:34:02,040
career, whether it's basketball
or baseball or football,

2709
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:03,990
they all go through it and
they all go through it.

2710
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:07,830
But for combat athletes it's even harder
because a lot of times when you're

2711
02:34:07,831 --> 02:34:12,480
going through it, your body is just
done. When it's over, you're done.

2712
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:16,050
I mean, you have like some serious
fucking problems, you know,

2713
02:34:16,051 --> 02:34:19,480
all these guys are getting their knees
fixed and they're back fixed and it's

2714
02:34:19,481 --> 02:34:23,620
like you can't train any train that
hard all the time. I'm sorry, but your,

2715
02:34:23,621 --> 02:34:26,830
your body's made a cartilage and
bone in it and it grinds away man.

2716
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:31,210
And there's so many fighters that have
like artificial discs or disks that are a

2717
02:34:31,211 --> 02:34:35,020
few ways to metamorris.
There was that guy who won his match.

2718
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:38,780
Braulio was tema and he's got a, he's
got an artificial disc in his neck. Yeah.

2719
02:34:38,781 --> 02:34:43,630
It's like a titanium. Yes, yes,
they do it. They do it in Europe.

2720
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:46,990
They don't do it in America,
but they do in Europe. Wow.

2721
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:49,390
At least I don't think they do it.
And how does that, how does that,

2722
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:52,810
how does he find that?
I guess he looked tough to me.

2723
02:34:53,230 --> 02:34:57,370
He's still a bad motherfucker. And
with this, his disk, I mean he uh,

2724
02:34:57,400 --> 02:35:01,150
he trains really hard and I know he wins
World Championships and he beats like

2725
02:35:01,151 --> 02:35:05,230
top, top, top level guys. I like
that community Jitsu community.

2726
02:35:05,231 --> 02:35:09,160
I had a really good feeling being at
Metamorris that that community is, um,

2727
02:35:09,190 --> 02:35:11,410
maybe it's a Brazilian thing.
I just like them. They just,

2728
02:35:11,411 --> 02:35:13,630
they just seem like a tight group.
Well,

2729
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:15,970
we've talked about this
in the podcast before.

2730
02:35:15,971 --> 02:35:18,370
The people that do Jujitsu and
get really good at Jujitsu,

2731
02:35:18,371 --> 02:35:22,570
they have healthy egos because you
have to tap out on a regular basis.

2732
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:26,710
You have to, unless you're Hixon Gracie
and no one's tapped you since 1980,

2733
02:35:27,100 --> 02:35:30,340
you getting tapped out on a regular basis.
It's just a part of the game.

2734
02:35:30,550 --> 02:35:33,820
You're going in there. You're rolling
with, you know, Bill Cooper and Solow,

2735
02:35:33,821 --> 02:35:36,640
he barrow and you rolling with a bunch
of savages, they're strangling you.

2736
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:40,360
And that's part of Jujitsu.
You know, you get tapped.

2737
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:43,360
I mean I've been tagged by blue belts.
You put yourself in a bad position.

2738
02:35:43,361 --> 02:35:45,190
Somebody catches some.
If you're dumb,

2739
02:35:45,490 --> 02:35:48,910
you know you don't tap and then you
get your arm broken. Cause guess what?

2740
02:35:48,911 --> 02:35:52,690
A 200 pound man who's a blue belt
who catches an armbar correctly.

2741
02:35:53,130 --> 02:35:55,840
And if you are tired and you
know it gets full extension,

2742
02:35:55,841 --> 02:35:59,620
you have to fucking tap. That's
it's what it is. It is what it is.

2743
02:35:59,830 --> 02:36:03,880
And when you're doing that on
a high level for a long time,

2744
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:07,300
you get a healthy ego because you're
always getting your ass kicked.

2745
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:10,480
You get your ass handed to
you and training, especially
when you do like those,

2746
02:36:10,481 --> 02:36:13,330
um, those drills where you
do like at a 10th planet,

2747
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:18,240
we'll do like nine minutes a live sparring
and then you have 30 seconds rest for

2748
02:36:18,241 --> 02:36:19,690
a minute, rest rather, uh,

2749
02:36:19,691 --> 02:36:22,720
where everybody grabs a drink and then
you go to the next person for nine

2750
02:36:22,721 --> 02:36:24,850
minutes. That's it. In two persons,

2751
02:36:25,030 --> 02:36:28,750
you're doing 18 minutes of co
Hanahan fucking combat a lot of fun.

2752
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:31,130
You're going to get tapped.
You're just going to get tapped if you,

2753
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:33,880
unless you're the best guy, unless
you're Eddie Bravo or one of the bad.

2754
02:36:33,881 --> 02:36:37,190
And even Eddie gets tapped occasionally
if he goes with his black belts or as

2755
02:36:37,191 --> 02:36:39,400
brown belts, maybe even,
you know, when you're,

2756
02:36:39,401 --> 02:36:41,800
when you're doing it on a
regular basis and you're tired,

2757
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:42,880
you're going to get fucking tapped.

2758
02:36:43,150 --> 02:36:45,280
And if you don't do it on
a regular basis and tired,

2759
02:36:45,460 --> 02:36:47,290
then you're not going to
know the proper defense.

2760
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:50,620
You're not going to know how to handle
yourself and defend yourself when you're

2761
02:36:50,621 --> 02:36:54,280
in a shitty situation. Watching
I eco get tapped by, um,

2762
02:36:54,430 --> 02:36:57,640
[inaudible] I mean I buy kron Gracie.
Yeah.

2763
02:36:58,130 --> 02:37:01,360
And you could see the disappointment
on his face because he's so good. Yeah.

2764
02:37:01,361 --> 02:37:05,560
Anything else? But it was just a, yeah.
It's like it happens to everybody.

2765
02:37:05,590 --> 02:37:09,070
You make one mistake, one mistake.
See, yeah. A guy like Cron,

2766
02:37:09,071 --> 02:37:13,270
he gets a hold of your neck that's and
let it go. He's trained by the master,

2767
02:37:13,960 --> 02:37:18,800
by the masters. And legitimate. I mean
he's, he's going to all like he's,

2768
02:37:18,980 --> 02:37:21,560
he trains with all the best
guys on a regular basis.

2769
02:37:21,561 --> 02:37:23,990
He's constantly got
killers coming to his gym.

2770
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:28,340
I mean Henry Gracie telling me eating
in a on a high level on a regular basis.

2771
02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:29,480
Yeah.
I think it was Hannah said,

2772
02:37:29,810 --> 02:37:32,750
he goes when he rolls with
[inaudible] and he said it's,

2773
02:37:33,230 --> 02:37:35,200
he's fighting for his life.
The last time I was nobody,

2774
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:36,320
nobody puts him through the ringer.

2775
02:37:36,321 --> 02:37:41,120
Like that guy just centers big when
your dad is Hixon fucking Gracie.

2776
02:37:41,210 --> 02:37:44,750
Just think about the amount of knowledge
that he must've related to his son.

2777
02:37:45,110 --> 02:37:47,870
If you don't know Jujitsu,
you know Hixon Gracie is like,

2778
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:53,230
there's not a whole lot of sports where
there's one guy who is universally

2779
02:37:53,271 --> 02:37:57,080
recognized as the mother fucker.

2780
02:37:57,470 --> 02:38:02,470
It's like the motherfucker
of motherfuckers when it
comes to Jujitsu is Hixon

2781
02:38:02,750 --> 02:38:06,410
Gracie because if you talked to anybody,
if you talked to hoist Gracie,

2782
02:38:06,411 --> 02:38:11,180
if you talk to any of these guys, and
this is going on by the way, by the way,

2783
02:38:11,181 --> 02:38:11,870
by the way,

2784
02:38:11,870 --> 02:38:16,870
in 1993 when the UFC was at first he
said when hoists was beating everybody in

2785
02:38:16,981 --> 02:38:20,810
UFC one, it was like huge. Should
see my brother Hicks, um, my brother,

2786
02:38:20,811 --> 02:38:24,060
he and kills me and he used
to talk about that. You know,

2787
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:27,590
the moment somebody beats me,
you're in trouble because then my brother,

2788
02:38:27,591 --> 02:38:32,591
he Exxon is going to join and I remember
Hixon if you watch the early days of

2789
02:38:33,141 --> 02:38:37,220
the UFC or that he was fighting in
Japan valley to doe, that's the,

2790
02:38:37,460 --> 02:38:40,640
you want to see a documentary
that'll get you into Jujitsu choke.

2791
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:42,800
It's you and I watched it together.

2792
02:38:42,820 --> 02:38:46,440
Kit Document and I want to have to go
that we were so quiet, we were selling,

2793
02:38:46,450 --> 02:38:48,470
I think we went out to dinner
afterwards when we were both,

2794
02:38:48,471 --> 02:38:51,020
so we were so awed and quiet.

2795
02:38:51,230 --> 02:38:55,520
I remember UN where he was talking about
how fear and intelligence are closely

2796
02:38:55,521 --> 02:38:58,470
related and you went like this. You just
said you couldn't help yourself song.

2797
02:38:58,490 --> 02:39:03,080
Anyway, listen to what he's saying, man.
I was like, I am. I haven't said a thing,

2798
02:39:03,081 --> 02:39:06,770
dude. You'd have to shout at me. We
were both so bunched up about it.

2799
02:39:07,130 --> 02:39:10,930
And by the way started
just by look how handsome.

2800
02:39:11,630 --> 02:39:16,460
I forget. Incredible flexibility in a
Speedo by the way, on, on, on in Malibu.

2801
02:39:16,490 --> 02:39:19,850
He said, by the way, I don't care. You
don't care cause Hixon brings out the,

2802
02:39:19,851 --> 02:39:24,110
by the way, I got to pee right
now. Go ahead and pay. It's uh,

2803
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:27,560
it's amazing when there's one guy
like that though that stands out.

2804
02:39:27,710 --> 02:39:29,510
And I think one of the things,
go ahead and pee.

2805
02:39:29,511 --> 02:39:33,800
I'll keep talking as if you were here.
What? We'll talk about everything. Go Pee.

2806
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:35,510
Um,
one of the things about it,

2807
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:40,540
a guy like Hixon that's so fascinating
is that what separates him from everybody

2808
02:39:41,751 --> 02:39:45,950
else is not just his physicality.
Like he's obviously very physical.

2809
02:39:46,130 --> 02:39:48,740
He's got great flexibility.
So obviously very strong.

2810
02:39:48,770 --> 02:39:52,670
If you looked at the old videos of
hoists, Gracie, when hoist won the UFC,

2811
02:39:52,671 --> 02:39:56,000
one of the things about hoist that
was so impressive was that he wasn't a

2812
02:39:56,001 --> 02:40:00,560
physically imposing guy.
Hoists was like 175 pounds.

2813
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:03,500
He was very thin and he
didn't have big muscles.

2814
02:40:03,650 --> 02:40:07,380
Hixon on the other hand is built
like a Greek God. So it's not,

2815
02:40:07,390 --> 02:40:10,940
he's not like muscular,
like say like a George Saint Pierre.

2816
02:40:10,941 --> 02:40:13,670
It was like more like a
gymnast or something like that.

2817
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:15,750
Doesn't make any sense because George
has kind of been like a gymnast,

2818
02:40:16,050 --> 02:40:19,110
but he was like a little
bit less muscular. Um,

2819
02:40:19,170 --> 02:40:23,400
but he's a strong looking dude,
like very obvious. But his,

2820
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:27,660
his thing was also the mind and also yoga.

2821
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:30,060
It wasn't just his technique
and his physicality.

2822
02:40:30,061 --> 02:40:33,030
It was also the fact that he
was like a recognized Yogi.

2823
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:36,560
So when everybody else was
like doing steroids and,

2824
02:40:36,770 --> 02:40:40,650
and running hills and shit
with weights on their back and,

2825
02:40:41,430 --> 02:40:44,040
and doing all this, uh,
you know, all these, uh,

2826
02:40:44,070 --> 02:40:47,280
different kinds of a
bodybuilding sort of things.

2827
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:51,510
Hickson's doing this weird thing with
his stomach where he's sucking in his

2828
02:40:51,511 --> 02:40:53,480
diaphragm doing this,
uh,

2829
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:57,600
these yoga breathing technique
that's really freaky to watch.

2830
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:02,840
We can pull his stomach and in control
his breath in this really astounding way.

2831
02:41:03,031 --> 02:41:06,720
He's also insanely flexible,
you know,

2832
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:10,140
like in every single way
in every single position.

2833
02:41:10,470 --> 02:41:15,470
And is his yoga is like one of the
more unique aspects of him as a martial

2834
02:41:17,191 --> 02:41:21,150
artist because he can move in such
strange ways because of the yoga.

2835
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:26,510
Like it's very rare that you get a guy
who's really strong and really flexible

2836
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:29,520
and that's what he was on top of that.

2837
02:41:29,610 --> 02:41:32,910
His fucking dad was Aly oh Gracie,

2838
02:41:32,911 --> 02:41:37,911
who was maybe the most important
man in the history of martial arts.

2839
02:41:39,210 --> 02:41:42,630
You're talking about a guy who in Jesus,
I mean,

2840
02:41:42,631 --> 02:41:46,350
he was doing these Jujitsu
matches in the 1940s.

2841
02:41:46,351 --> 02:41:50,970
He was learning these techniques
that were taught to him by my Ada,

2842
02:41:50,971 --> 02:41:55,890
by these, uh, these Japanese
judo guys fought this Guy Kimora,

2843
02:41:56,070 --> 02:41:59,790
which is a where that famous shoulder
lock, his name, that Kimora shoulder lock.

2844
02:41:59,970 --> 02:42:03,720
He fought Eylea Gracie and Eylea let the
guy break his arm instead of tapping.

2845
02:42:04,050 --> 02:42:06,720
That's how bad ass he is.
Imagine growing up and that's your dad.

2846
02:42:06,990 --> 02:42:11,160
Your Dad decides to let some guys snap
is on chicken wing because he doesn't

2847
02:42:11,161 --> 02:42:15,490
want to tap.
So he learned how to do small man Jujitsu.

2848
02:42:15,510 --> 02:42:20,400
He Changed Jujitsu because he was a
little guy. He was only like 140 pounds.

2849
02:42:20,610 --> 02:42:24,270
So because of that he was scrapping
with all these big dudes. He had to,

2850
02:42:24,271 --> 02:42:28,440
what he called Cook them, he had to let
them cook. He couldn't just eat them raw.

2851
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:30,450
He had a slowly tire,
these bitches,

2852
02:42:30,451 --> 02:42:33,810
all the cooking that call them cooking
though. He had a slowly tie them out.

2853
02:42:33,811 --> 02:42:38,640
So he developed like a very extensive
repertoire of techniques to use from the

2854
02:42:38,641 --> 02:42:42,780
guard and he also developed the concept
of protecting yourself in a real self

2855
02:42:42,781 --> 02:42:46,660
defense situation. Elio,
Gracie, long before the UFC,

2856
02:42:46,661 --> 02:42:51,330
he was putting himself in these valley
Tudo matches where he would go out there

2857
02:42:51,331 --> 02:42:54,600
and just Duke it out with dudes like,
and they would like they,

2858
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:58,380
they'd put on these events in Brazil
and he would have these time limits.

2859
02:42:58,440 --> 02:43:03,420
And then his, his cousin, uh, Carlos, uh,
well was, there was a bunch of different,

2860
02:43:03,421 --> 02:43:05,280
there was his brother is Carlson,

2861
02:43:05,310 --> 02:43:08,460
Gracie was his cousin and crossing Gracie
became like the most winningest guy.

2862
02:43:08,461 --> 02:43:10,050
He was a bigger,
stronger guy.

2863
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:13,170
And he came in and some of the
guys that Leo couldn't be beat and,

2864
02:43:13,470 --> 02:43:18,470
but Leo developed like not just a system
of Jujitsu but a series of killers that

2865
02:43:20,231 --> 02:43:24,490
we're sons. I mean his sons
or house and Gracie Horian,

2866
02:43:24,491 --> 02:43:27,280
Gracie hoists, Gracie Hixon,
Gracie Heuler, Gracie.

2867
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:31,870
I mean there's never been a motherfucker
ever who developed that many killers as

2868
02:43:31,871 --> 02:43:32,704
sons.

2869
02:43:32,710 --> 02:43:37,690
And then those guys go off and branch
out out into the world and spread you

2870
02:43:37,691 --> 02:43:42,570
Jitsu. The most astounding family in
the history of martial arts. Barn done.

2871
02:43:43,350 --> 02:43:46,520
None is the Gracie family changed.
They changed it all.

2872
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:49,500
They changed and the and the, the grand
put truth to and you know what I mean.

2873
02:43:49,510 --> 02:43:52,510
All of a sudden all your Kung fu
and everything is no good in here.

2874
02:43:52,511 --> 02:43:57,090
My friend and it boils down in my
opinion all to the grandmaster Caz,

2875
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:59,860
but his, it was his bro.
It was Carlos for sure.

2876
02:43:59,861 --> 02:44:02,590
Carlos Gracie was also very
important in the development of it,

2877
02:44:02,591 --> 02:44:06,850
but Leo was out there, Duke in and
out with guys and he was small.

2878
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:11,710
He was a small guy and because of that
and because of the impact of his sons,

2879
02:44:11,830 --> 02:44:14,650
I think he's like the most important
figure in the history of martial arts.

2880
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:17,440
I would, I would argue that that's,
that's, I don't think there's any denying.

2881
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:21,640
Once the UFC came along and his
son who wasn't even the best one,

2882
02:44:22,210 --> 02:44:26,440
was killing everybody. He sent in his
son. That wasn't even the best one.

2883
02:44:26,441 --> 02:44:28,030
Credible and that incredible.

2884
02:44:28,510 --> 02:44:31,840
I remember him being this wrestling
wizard and I was watching him and I was

2885
02:44:31,841 --> 02:44:33,890
watching him go on. I that
doesn't look like, I don't know,

2886
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:35,990
it looks like kind of bad wrestling.
I don't really get it. Well,

2887
02:44:35,991 --> 02:44:40,450
you let guys take them down. Fight off his
back. Maybe fod, Dan Severn, Dan Severen,

2888
02:44:40,451 --> 02:44:44,050
250 fucking pound giant wrestler.
Awesome.

2889
02:44:44,051 --> 02:44:48,130
Take down when he gets caught a triangle
by this little skinny guy and Ken

2890
02:44:48,131 --> 02:44:50,360
shamrock and this weird thing,
a weird,

2891
02:44:50,770 --> 02:44:54,700
he got him with each choke choked him
as gay. Yeah. Look Hoists Gracie was,

2892
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:56,530
that was an important
moment for martial arts.

2893
02:44:56,530 --> 02:45:01,530
And there was the first time also that
we realized that like in the movies,

2894
02:45:02,861 --> 02:45:05,590
it was always a little dude with
skill that was beating the fuck out.

2895
02:45:05,591 --> 02:45:10,270
All of these guys. It was always Bruce
Lee. It was small but fast as fuck.

2896
02:45:10,271 --> 02:45:14,680
And using his martial arts defeat much
larger Sammo hung looking dudes, you know,

2897
02:45:14,681 --> 02:45:19,420
or uh, who was the guy with a big
muscles? All Bolo. Bolo Young, right?

2898
02:45:19,630 --> 02:45:20,530
So you know,

2899
02:45:20,560 --> 02:45:23,890
and Chuck Norris member when Chuck Norris
and him duked it out narcis bigger and

2900
02:45:23,891 --> 02:45:26,770
stronger and Bruce Lee fucked him up.
But in the real world,

2901
02:45:27,070 --> 02:45:29,440
that didn't really happen that often.
And the real world,

2902
02:45:29,441 --> 02:45:32,640
those big guys sorta got ahold of you.
Beat your fucking head in oak pulp.

2903
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:36,100
That's more of what most of
us saw on a regular basis.

2904
02:45:36,310 --> 02:45:39,640
So then when you have the craziest
event in the history of martial arts,

2905
02:45:39,700 --> 02:45:42,700
this is cage fighting event where
you're going to lock all these different

2906
02:45:42,701 --> 02:45:44,200
styles in it.
Find out who's the best,

2907
02:45:44,710 --> 02:45:48,880
the odds that this one really technical
small guy I was going to win there were

2908
02:45:48,881 --> 02:45:51,790
astronomical as far as the martial
arts community was concerned.

2909
02:45:52,090 --> 02:45:54,150
They thought that the biggest
karate guy was gonna win.

2910
02:45:54,180 --> 02:45:56,410
You know just your biggest
guy who can kick them out.

2911
02:45:56,420 --> 02:45:59,520
A lot of guys who were karate guys thought
they were going to win because they'd

2912
02:45:59,530 --> 02:46:01,980
never been tested.
A lot of guys like judo,

2913
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:06,320
judo guys and they're karate Kung Fu guys
and get in there a Krav Maga guys and

2914
02:46:06,321 --> 02:46:09,530
they actually believed because they had
been training so long that they were

2915
02:46:09,531 --> 02:46:14,150
going to win until all of a sudden
they get caught in these weird jokes.

2916
02:46:14,151 --> 02:46:16,730
Armbars punched in the face.
It was this a whole,

2917
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:20,900
well this is how little they knew about
it. When guys got into certain positions,

2918
02:46:20,901 --> 02:46:22,700
it got to a point where guys
going into certain positions,

2919
02:46:22,701 --> 02:46:24,440
they thought there was no
escape in those positions.

2920
02:46:24,470 --> 02:46:28,940
They would just tap out when rem co
Pardo who is like a really tough Guy Fart

2921
02:46:28,940 --> 02:46:31,490
Marco who os all Marco
who Austin was mount him,

2922
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:35,150
Marco mountain him and he's like, well
the basically the fights over so he taps,

2923
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:39,800
he taps some Marco mounts him like that's
like a regular basis that like happens

2924
02:46:39,801 --> 02:46:41,330
all the time in high level fights.

2925
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:44,270
I think about Anderson sell his first
round with shell son and she'll mounted

2926
02:46:44,271 --> 02:46:48,440
him for like most of the first round
in the second fight and then in the,

2927
02:46:48,441 --> 02:46:50,810
in the second round came back and
stopped him and knocked him out.

2928
02:46:50,940 --> 02:46:54,080
Like the idea that a guy mounts you
in a fights over. Like that's how,

2929
02:46:54,290 --> 02:46:59,290
that's how much MMA and that's how much
Jujitsu has come along since the 1990s.

2930
02:47:00,260 --> 02:47:03,530
We know that Anderson's going to
fight Chris Weidman again. Yes.

2931
02:47:03,531 --> 02:47:05,470
It's going to be December 29th you coming.
Uh,

2932
02:47:05,500 --> 02:47:10,500
I'm definitely come doing the
Mirage night calling cal me in and,

2933
02:47:10,550 --> 02:47:12,680
and but the thing is that um,
it's going to be,

2934
02:47:12,681 --> 02:47:17,681
you did see how dominant and son was
when he got into Chris's head and then to

2935
02:47:18,741 --> 02:47:21,650
fool around to that extent was just so,

2936
02:47:21,710 --> 02:47:23,930
well I wouldn't say was he was dominant.

2937
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:28,160
He was definitely hitting Weidman and he
was hitting him with a lot of leg kicks.

2938
02:47:28,190 --> 02:47:29,360
Yeah,
that was the big issue.

2939
02:47:29,660 --> 02:47:32,720
And that was one thing that John
Danaher was concerned about,

2940
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:36,410
talked to don her after the fights with
this is how much of a mastermind John

2941
02:47:36,410 --> 02:47:39,530
Danaher is. He's the Jujitsu
coach and I love John by the way.

2942
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:41,480
He's a brilliant investor,
John Brilliant Guy.

2943
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:45,710
But right after Weidman just knocks
out Anderson, I, I go up to them, I go,

2944
02:47:45,711 --> 02:47:48,250
congratulations.
And he goes very concerned about the,

2945
02:47:48,251 --> 02:47:51,200
about metal leg kicks he was
taking, he was our, he just,

2946
02:47:51,860 --> 02:47:55,010
I understood the next
fight inside the octagon.

2947
02:47:55,010 --> 02:47:58,490
He was thinking even the most spectacular
result possible and knocked down

2948
02:47:58,491 --> 02:48:00,200
Anderson Silva and he's like,
well,

2949
02:48:00,201 --> 02:48:02,060
I'm not happy with the amount
of live kicks he was taking.

2950
02:48:02,090 --> 02:48:06,350
He wasn't defending the lake
kicks correctly like this.
Guys like on it as well.

2951
02:48:06,351 --> 02:48:10,430
He should be. You have to be in that game.
That can't be any, you're the best kid.

2952
02:48:10,490 --> 02:48:14,600
No one's ever going to beat Ya.
He recognizes like this played out great,

2953
02:48:14,630 --> 02:48:18,290
but we got an issue because Anderson
Silva seems to be able to see everything

2954
02:48:18,300 --> 02:48:19,070
you're doing.

2955
02:48:19,070 --> 02:48:22,000
It's going to be real interesting to see
what happens in the sacrifice can do.

2956
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:24,590
It's interesting to see if
Anderson showboats at all. Again,

2957
02:48:24,710 --> 02:48:27,080
it's going to be interesting to
see how Weidman approaches it,

2958
02:48:27,081 --> 02:48:30,530
how company is now Wyman's
getting better all the time.

2959
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:34,310
The fact that he knocked out Anderson
Silva in his 10th fucking professional

2960
02:48:34,311 --> 02:48:39,260
fight is insane. It's, it's
also a testament to Anderson
Silva fucking around.

2961
02:48:39,410 --> 02:48:43,880
Not really because Weidman had him down
in the ground and had him in a heel hook

2962
02:48:43,881 --> 02:48:44,900
long before that.

2963
02:48:45,080 --> 02:48:48,620
What's going to happen in the second
fight would've Weidman is six inches

2964
02:48:48,621 --> 02:48:52,520
further down the knee when he wraps up
that heel hook and what if he uses the

2965
02:48:52,521 --> 02:48:57,110
legs properly next time and laces them
differently and locks up his hips so that

2966
02:48:57,111 --> 02:49:01,820
he can't roll out of it and then rips
his knee apart who some are called Horace

2967
02:49:01,821 --> 02:49:04,100
style. I would tell you
this, I would tell you this,

2968
02:49:04,101 --> 02:49:08,770
Anderson has met and dealt with
wrestlers that are as good or better.

2969
02:49:09,480 --> 02:49:13,170
No, you're wrong. You're wrong, you're
wrong. It's bad. It's good at wrestling.

2970
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:14,760
It's better freestyle,

2971
02:49:14,761 --> 02:49:17,880
Russell Weidman's better four time
all American and not only that,

2972
02:49:17,910 --> 02:49:18,780
not only is he better,

2973
02:49:18,781 --> 02:49:23,550
he's bigger and faster and scarier
because he's got vicious knockout power,

2974
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:27,750
which is what shell son had never had
because he knocked out Uriah hall.

2975
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:30,750
That kid who was the standout
in the ultimate fighter
that the one by we'll kick

2976
02:49:30,751 --> 02:49:33,720
the last ultimate fighter.
He knocked that guy out with a left hook,

2977
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:36,930
the same left hook that he knocked out
Anderson with. He knocks people out.

2978
02:49:36,950 --> 02:49:39,810
He knocked out Munoz with an elbow.
He smashed his people.

2979
02:49:39,811 --> 02:49:43,530
He also puts people to sleep. You
can't take anything away from that kid.

2980
02:49:43,740 --> 02:49:47,850
He won that fight because Anderson Silva
fucked up and he didn't respect him.

2981
02:49:47,851 --> 02:49:52,770
He dropped his hands and he and he got
clipped. But Wyman still won that fight.

2982
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:56,970
There's a lot of fucking people that
have been in that same situation wouldn't

2983
02:49:56,971 --> 02:49:58,260
have been able to do shit.

2984
02:49:58,560 --> 02:50:02,790
He was able to do shit because he's
a forest Griffin and Damien Maia,

2985
02:50:02,791 --> 02:50:06,180
he's a motherfucker dude. He's the
real deal. The question is though,

2986
02:50:06,181 --> 02:50:09,910
is Anderson more of a motherfucker and
more of the real deal and what Anderson

2987
02:50:09,911 --> 02:50:12,030
are we going to see in that second fight?
Cause then that second fight,

2988
02:50:12,360 --> 02:50:16,920
he's going to be so goddamn motivated.
There's nobody like Anderson Silva.

2989
02:50:17,090 --> 02:50:21,150
I mean he's just so far and
away better than it seems.

2990
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:24,720
I don't know how he does it. I just,
I, it's the craziest thing. You know,

2991
02:50:24,721 --> 02:50:27,540
he's just very good athlete.
He's incredible what he does.

2992
02:50:27,541 --> 02:50:31,800
He's been doing it forever. He's a
master at Moitai, a master at Jujitsu.

2993
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:36,510
He's a master at MMA. He's like faster.
We still lost and that's why it's, it's a,

2994
02:50:36,520 --> 02:50:38,850
there's a beautiful lesson
in there for fighters.

2995
02:50:39,150 --> 02:50:41,580
There's a beautiful lesson
about human human beings.

2996
02:50:42,210 --> 02:50:46,860
Even the greatest ever. If you clip
them on the chin, they go on conscience.

2997
02:50:46,890 --> 02:50:49,530
He's going out. That's just how it
is with Mamah. Cheney is going out.

2998
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:54,120
We ran out of time, man. Fucking shit.
You're the best. I love you. I love you.

2999
02:50:54,180 --> 02:50:58,820
We're going November shop this weekend
come and then November where on meter

3000
02:50:58,830 --> 02:51:01,860
again and do another after. We're
hunters now. When are we doing it?

3001
02:51:01,861 --> 02:51:06,620
Well doing it Toronto. Uh, ninth
the 19th nine September 19th. Yeah.

3002
02:51:06,990 --> 02:51:10,650
Kalyn and I are doing, um, I don't
know what the fuck it's called.

3003
02:51:10,651 --> 02:51:13,500
The Sony something or something.
And Toronto. What is it called?

3004
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:17,910
Did I tell you ready? Whatever
it is, you'll find it. It's
almost sold out though.

3005
02:51:17,911 --> 02:51:19,710
I should tell you that.
It's a,

3006
02:51:20,220 --> 02:51:22,160
I think last time I checked
there was like three quarters.

3007
02:51:22,170 --> 02:51:25,380
It's only been on sale for like a week,
but it's a,

3008
02:51:25,390 --> 02:51:29,220
it's already like three quarters sold out
or at least half sold out or something.

3009
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:33,780
It's the Sony Center for the Performing
Arts. I fucking love Toronto.

3010
02:51:33,781 --> 02:51:36,810
It's one of my favorite places
to go. Oh, the updated. Okay.

3011
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:41,850
There's still some tickets left.
Um, the Sony Centre is a new place.

3012
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:46,220
I usually do a Massey hall, but that's
the same weakest just for laughs. The,

3013
02:51:46,370 --> 02:51:49,530
the festival they have up there. Canada
is just, everybody loves to come to,

3014
02:51:49,550 --> 02:51:53,410
I love Canada. I love
performing in Canada. It's so
much fun. I'm doing it. Uh,

3015
02:51:53,530 --> 02:51:57,240
Calgary and um, November,
October Bryan Callen Dotcom,

And follow him on Twitter because every
time I look at his Twitter numbers,

3018
02:52:03,481 --> 02:52:07,520
I get sad. You need something? I count
how many accounts show or you won the,

3019
02:52:07,610 --> 02:52:10,630
are you on the Twitter all the time?
You'd be tweeting all the time. Yeah.

3020
02:52:10,631 --> 02:52:13,210
I'm just, I'm not staying on
top of that shit. My podcast,

3021
02:52:13,211 --> 02:52:16,960
I've been doing thanks to you. I think
I've got 75 episodes now. Beautiful.

3022

Great guests. So a township.
It's a fun podcast.

3023
02:52:20,500 --> 02:52:24,460
It's fun podcasts and I do get a lot of
interesting motherfucker, Joe Rogan. Well,

3024
02:52:24,461 --> 02:52:25,780
it's, you know, it's not you look,

3025
02:52:25,820 --> 02:52:29,160
it's thanks to all these people that were
sort of connected to online. We're all,

3026
02:52:29,161 --> 02:52:32,230
we're all sort of connected to all these
interesting people that are willing to

3027
02:52:32,231 --> 02:52:35,250
now do the show and then you get more
and then you help them and like I just

3028
02:52:35,251 --> 02:52:36,700
want,
my job is just to inspire.

3029
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:39,400
I just want to take young people and show
him that there's a world out there of

3030
02:52:39,401 --> 02:52:42,850
people who can teach you stuff. I'm
getting a sleep expert on, I'm getting,

3031
02:52:43,150 --> 02:52:44,890
I just love doing it. I
like getting, you know,

3032
02:52:44,891 --> 02:52:47,200
I said I think I'm getting
Jared diamond on who?

3033
02:52:47,500 --> 02:52:51,460
Who won a Pulitzer prize for guns, germs
and steel and blow. It was great book.

3034
02:52:51,461 --> 02:52:52,960
What I'm realizing is
all these guys write,

3035
02:52:52,961 --> 02:52:56,290
these great books are sitting around in
a room writing and they liked to talk to

3036
02:52:56,291 --> 02:52:58,140
people and I'll get a chance to his mind,

3037
02:52:58,180 --> 02:52:59,800
why wouldn't they want
to teach people like me?

3038
02:53:00,040 --> 02:53:03,010
