1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,170
I liked the art bill buildup because so
everybody likes the art bell buildup,

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,430
the art bell sound,
you know what did,

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,570
what did he say from the Kingdom of Nih
and Nih?

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,240
PAHRUMP,
Nevada.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,450
I used to always love our bell because
someone would call in and say,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,450
I'm aware wolf,
and here we go.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,980
Ooh,
my interesting.

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,810
Tell me more.
He didn't care.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,060
He never.
He never called you out on it.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,220
Just let you let you ramble.
Hit time.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,320
Traveler lines.
Loved the people.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,150
Loved it.
I never learned anything from it though.

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,330
So you're obsessed with Ufo,
right?

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,900
Is that safe to say?
It's safe to say,

15
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,350
but it's not so much just the Ufo at its
self.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,330
I mean there.
I don't call them that anymore,

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,130
that we call these advanced aerial
threats.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,090
There are different threats.
You were honed in our word.

19
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,970
We weren't supposed to really get into
here in the first part of the show.

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,110
Did you have a plan?
I have a very.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,710
I have a very long plan.
Detailed plan.

22
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,050
We're going to start with my body.
We're just going to talk about my body

23
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:02,640
for a lot and.
Okay.

24
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,320
What do you want to talk about in terms
of your body?

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,540
Well,
my body is interesting.

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,570
It's unique.
It changes shape and what I've noticed

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,240
is it's just changing.
It's getting larger and larger,

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,950
getting wider pending upon what you put
in it.

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,570
But you're off.
Can I cuss?

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,201
Yeah,
yeah,

31
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:20,280
for sure.
We're on the Internet.

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,260
You're still fucking fit.
You shook my hand.

33
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:24,060
I think it would break my hand.
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,140
Yeah,
just don't be strong.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,160
I didn't mean to.
Don't be.

36
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,490
You're shaking your hand.
Just thought it was a handshake.

37
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,670
I know.
Well,

38
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,150
it's one of those power moves you ever
see when trump shakes people's hands and

39
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:34,550
he pulls them in and he's like,
yeah,

40
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:35,460
he does do weird shit.

41
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,690
Does weird shit like that.
Yeah.

42
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,980
Yeah.
I didn't mean to do that.

43
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,240
It just meant to shake your hand like a
man.

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,193
Well,
I,

45
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,260
I took it as like know your place
motherfucker.

46
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,480
Oh this is my show.
I didn't think that.

47
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,921
No,
I'm just joking.

48
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,330
Interesting.
Um,

49
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,970
so how,
when did you get obsessed with this

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,600
aerial threat thing and why?
Why do you,

51
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,470
why do you call them threats?
Uh,

52
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,150
we'll get into that I guess.
Um,

53
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,053
but,
uh,

54
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,430
uh,
I got into when I was in junior high,

55
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,730
um,
for some weird reason I had like some

56
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,150
time off in,
um,

57
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,410
and I went to the school library and
like seventh grade and I was like,

58
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,300
damn,
I gotta read some Boring Shit,

59
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,240
what am I going to read?
And I saw this one book and it had a

60
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,070
picture of the lochness monster and like
a,

61
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,510
you have almost,
that looks cool.

62
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,550
And I read that and I was like,
holy cow,

63
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,610
these are like real.
It wasn't all science fiction.

64
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,190
I mean the way the book was laid out,
it's like these are like real event and

65
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:23,970
so I'm all,
there's no,

66
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,500
no way really.
And then,

67
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,500
uh,
when the band started doing it,

68
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,910
staying in the back of the van,
there were no smartphones.

69
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,320
So as we were buying books and um,
and I would just lay there,

70
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,290
we'd have like 20 hour drives and,
and so I started buying books on the Ufo

71
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,840
phenomenon and I was,
want you to do that.

72
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:40,770
It's a black hole.
You're done.

73
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,540
Yeah,
it's definitely a rabbit hole.

74
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,170
You get sucked into it.
I,

75
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,450
uh,
my house,

76
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:50,451
I have a frame poster that's the cover
of the Roswell Daily News shows the day

77
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:55,800
after the Roswell crash where it says
that the air force came and recovered

78
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,300
the wreckage and,
you know,

79
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,130
the whole deal.
I've been obsessed with this shit.

80
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,130
I was a little kid.

81
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,070
Yeah.
Uh,

82
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:03,560
I think,
I think that's a,

83
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,530
I think that's by design.
I think that this generation is a,

84
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,420
was meant to have this stuff come out.
Um,

85
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,640
but,
you know,

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,140
I can't prove that.
That's just my feeling.

87
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,570
What would it makes you feel that like,
um,

88
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,390
because of exactly what you said,
there was a lot of people.

89
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,340
I don't believe that some of the,
um,

90
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,650
I don't believe that some of the events
happened on accident.

91
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,910
You know,
I think that,

92
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,100
uh,
there's been a lot of events that are on

93
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:31,660
purpose,
some have been for show,

94
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,880
some have been for um,
human,

95
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,620
there's a variety of,
a variety of reasons,

96
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:40,621
but I think a lot of it is a control
system that's really pushing humanity in

97
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,080
a very specific direction.
And uh,

98
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,170
so like they've got a timeframe where
they had these events take place.

99
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,220
Is that what you think?
Yeah.

100
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,130
And they also time travel,
which is different than what people

101
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,590
think in like a movie where they sit in
a machine and you often,

102
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,900
you're in the 19 thirties and you got to
go save humanity.

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,120
Um,
when you use the technology,

104
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,530
you have a,
there's a time a difference between

105
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,680
where,
what they're doing inside of an article

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,950
artificially created bubble of gravity
of sorts.

107
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,010
And then what's on the outside.
So if you're on the inside of one of

108
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,460
those machines,
everything would be skewed more black

109
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,830
and white.
There'd be like a red shift and

110
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:21,760
everybody would look frozen.
So you literally could fly around and

111
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,130
grab a coke out of someone's hand and
put it in someone else's hand.

112
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,870
It's really,
where are you getting this from?

113
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Will take a wild guess.
Look at the people I'm surrounded by,

114
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,334
you know,
so,

115
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,410
so the people you're surrounded by are
telling you this is what it is a well,

116
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,310
I don't want to get into that,
but the people I'm surrounded with,

117
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,110
um,
and myself,

118
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,130
uh,
you know,

119
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,720
are very close to this stuff.

120
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,100
But the physics,
you know,

121
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,250
the physicist that's a Co founder of my
company to the star,

122
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,010
he's a Nobel nominee.
He wrote the book on Plasma Physics.

123
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,390
He,
what's his name?

124
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,670
Uh,
Hal put off Dr Hal put off and he,

125
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,820
he created remote viewing.
Do you know what remote viewing is?

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,180
He's the creator of the CIA psychics spy
program.

127
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:06,181
But he also has done like really exotic,
advanced forefront propulsion work for

128
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,260
the past decades and decades actually.
I mean,

129
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,350
he,
he's deep into like quantum,

130
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,040
this and that.
So he's the one that actually told me

131
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,090
about the red shift.
Yeah.

132
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,570
And so they have experienced this
physically or is this just theoretical

133
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,390
or they know that it exists?
Like the technology?

134
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,880
Yes.
Uh,

135
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,420
I,
I believe that the technology,

136
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,700
uh,
not only exists,

137
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,870
we've figured out how to play with it,
but I'm not going to really get into

138
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:41,470
that here.

139
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,630
I what,
what that is what we're doing at my

140
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:45,310
company though.
That is the announcement.

141
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,300
So Steve Justice was head of advanced
programs that the skunk works and the

142
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,640
skunkworks or who built,
you know,

143
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,640
the famous secret basis,
you hear about skunk works,

144
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:57,530
did you know the u two spy plane,
the SR seven one blackbird,

145
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,730
1:17 style fighter and it's all groom
lake out there,

146
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,070
all that kind of stuff.
And um,

147
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,440
and he literally was in charge of all
the advanced program.

148
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,161
So,
you know,

149
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,810
you've got the boss and you got him and
um,

150
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,410
he came,
uh,

151
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:16,190
he just finished his career over there
within the past two months.

152
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,370
I think it is an.
And he was on stage with me when we came

153
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,530
out and said,
we're going to be building one of these

154
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:23,530
things.
So when,

155
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,680
when you save it,
this,

156
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,630
all this technology exists,
have they explained this to you or have

157
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,770
you seen it physically?

158
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,200
Oh,
I haven't seen anything physically like

159
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:33,800
that.
I'm not,

160
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,250
I wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere if
that does or doesn't exist.

161
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:41,750
So they've just explained to you that
this exists and that this is in the

162
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,390
hands of the US government.
This I think.

163
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:44,871
No,
no,

164
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,160
I see.
I don't want to get into that kind of

165
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:46,994
stuff.
But um,

166
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,790
if you don't mind,
well why is it that you want to not get

167
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,690
into certain things?
Well,

168
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,250
I don't want to speak act,
you know,

169
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,710
I represent more than myself these days.
So,

170
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:56,390
uh,
I definitely have to watch what I say.

171
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,300
Who Do you represent when you say
represent more than yourself?

172
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,120
The team that I'm with.
So when you look at the people that are

173
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,180
a part of my company,
it's under secretary of defense's and

174
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,010
defense and senior intelligence service.
Is there a list of these people like

175
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,680
that we could see?

176
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,810
Oh yeah.
I thought you guys would have had that

177
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,530
list where folks could see it online.
Oh yeah,

178
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,060
they can go to,
um,

179
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,680
to the Stars Academy Dot Com.
Scroll down and you'll be able to see

180
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,970
who they all are.
So,

181
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,190
so how did you get linked up with all
these people?

182
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,270
That story might be a better way to
start because a lot of people don't know

183
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:31,420
this part of the story and I think
you're going to find it pretty funny.

184
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,320
Odd as well.
But uh,

185
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,420
okay.
So we'll back up a couple of years.

186
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,350
So,
um,

187
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,300
I have,
I was obviously,

188
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,030
and you know,
I started the band blink and blink went

189
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,630
places and um,
and then uh,

190
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,650
but we always had a weird band
relationship,

191
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:49,610
like most bands and we also thought that
we would never be big.

192
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:54,611
So we started companies on the side and
I had a company that incubated a lot of

193
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,750
small startups like software and apparel
and hardcore skate surf companies and

194
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:00,584
stuff like that.

195
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,710
Well,
I learned a lot from that and I pulled

196
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:07,730
out and entertainment startup called to
the stars and I knew I was going to be

197
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:12,731
doing kind of like science fiction,
franchised stories just like Disney,

198
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,890
but science fiction for adults.
And what that means is,

199
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,910
you know,
I make a story,

200
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:19,700
I title it,
I brand it and I put out the book and I

201
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,320
put up the merchandise and I go make a
movie,

202
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,540
you know,
and it's,

203
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,980
it's a,
it's a vertically integrated kind of

204
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,180
model.
Well,

205
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:29,390
one of the stories I knew I wanted to
put out with secret machines,

206
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:33,210
which was kind of a historical fiction,
um,

207
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,330
but based on real events about the UFO
phenomenon,

208
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:39,590
but I also knew that I knew shit that
most people don't know because I've

209
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:43,670
studied it for so long and I happened to
put some pieces together that most

210
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,020
people don't put together.

211
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,910
So before I came out with that book and
before I came out with the plan to take

212
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,380
that,
make major motion pictures and all that

213
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,940
kind of stuff,
um,

214
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,410
I,
I knew I needed to ask permission.

215
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,620
So I flew,
I flew around to places it can't say who

216
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:02,514
they were,
but,

217
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,420
and they,
they listened to my pitch and um,

218
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,230
and then I got a,
I got a email out of nowhere that says

219
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,210
meet us next to the Pentagon at this day
and time.

220
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,090
And I did that.
And from mapping email from just,

221
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,230
I just tend to person.
No,

222
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:17,491
no,
no,

223
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,690
I just can't tell you who it's from.
And so then I go out the next to the

224
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,940
Pentagon.
So you just go to the Pentagon.

225
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,260
I flew out depending on city.
Yeah.

226
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,490
Yeah.
It's like,

227
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,810
dude,
this is freaking out.

228
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,550
I'll tell you,
when I started freaking out,

229
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,384
there's more shit.

230
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,400
It gets way worse.
This is nothing.

231
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,800
Um,
so that started me out in,

232
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,650
out near DC,
taking some other high level meetings

233
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,350
and there was somebody at a very high
level that,

234
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,840
that,
uh,

235
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,170
close the door with many.
I says,

236
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,820
okay,
I'm going to introduce you to somebody

237
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,300
and that person comes to San Diego,
puts me on the phone with a general.

238
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,750
And the general is listening to my
little stump speech about what I want to

239
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,360
do with this franchise because it was,
I definitely didn't want to,

240
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,790
you know,
I wasn't looking to like force

241
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,490
disclosure and I wasn't looking to be
rogue and break secrets.

242
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,090
I was like,
look,

243
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,800
I know what's going on here and you guys
are doing a kick ass job.

244
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,720
And I would have done the exact same
thing.

245
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,640
Should I have been the guy at the top
that had to make some really hardcore

246
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,310
decisions 70 years ago.

247
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,810
So I'm,
I want to support you.

248
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:17,730
I think people are cynical because
there's a vacuum.

249
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:22,440
You guys can't say what you're doing.
So all these people are just coming up

250
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:23,970
with a bunch of bullshit to say,
Oh,

251
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,190
you know,
they don't want us to know or we can't

252
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,230
handle it.
Or it's all about oil and money and all

253
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:31,830
this weird shit.
And you would put these pieces together

254
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,430
and independently I did.
And so based on books that you read,

255
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,220
yet people think,
you know,

256
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,860
people think that places like the CIA
and the dia,

257
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,570
all these intelligence organizations
have,

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,070
um,
you know,

259
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,810
a monopoly on information.
They don't,

260
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,970
they get their information from the real
world too,

261
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,870
you know,
uh,

262
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,160
they do have access to,
to,

263
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,770
you know,
archives of information.

264
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:57,771
They do have access to some amazing
satellite data and stuff like that.

265
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,500
But if you're smart and you take your
time,

266
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:03,210
you know where to look and you find
patterns,

267
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,160
um,
you can pretty much put together all the

268
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:05,550
same shit.

269
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,350
They can kind of,
you know.

270
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,890
And that's what I did.
And so when I pitched what I wanted to

271
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:11,970
do,
he said,

272
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,680
come up and meet me tomorrow.
And so I flew up to NASA,

273
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:20,340
actually a Nasa Ames and had a two hour
meeting there.

274
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,100
And after two hours,
that person says,

275
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,830
he looks me in the eyes,
I'm going to introduce you to someone

276
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:27,600
else.
And he did.

277
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,750
And so I got on the phone with this
person and this person,

278
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:32,370
you know,
I'm a skeptic,

279
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:34,440
I'm a skeptic.
And then at the end of the conversation

280
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,150
he goes,
um,

281
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,560
he goes,
fly out and see me.

282
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,700
And so I did and that's when things
really started happening.

283
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,390
So I mean now I fly out to this airport
and I,

284
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,870
I sit at a table in a restaurant at the
airport,

285
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:52,920
no one's in there and this gentleman
sits down and the waiter comes up,

286
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:53,980
he waves off the waiter and he

287
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,460
looks me in the eye and says it was the
Cold War and we found a life form and

288
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:00,250
that's when I started shitting my pants
because I know a lot about this stuff.

289
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:05,251
But you always wait to talk to somebody
that is one of the inside people you

290
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:11,050
always want to have sits down at a
restaurant with you at the airport and

291
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,450
tells you that they found a life form.
Yes.

292
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,050
And during the Cold War,
during the Cold War and everything that

293
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:20,740
they did in every decision they made at
the time was because of the

294
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,650
consciousness of the Cold War.
Why's this guy decided to meet with you

295
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,930
in an airport?
Because the only way you meet with these

296
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:28,570
people,
the only way you ever would have anyone

297
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:31,120
talk to you is if you can provide a
service that they need.

298
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,860
And my service was pretty interesting to
them because I said,

299
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:36,790
look,
you guys,

300
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,800
you know,
you struggle with saying,

301
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,780
disclosure,
you want to tell everybody everything,

302
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:42,490
which I don't think everyone should know
everything.

303
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,740
Um,
and then you say they can't handle it,

304
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,090
so don't tell them anything,
you know.

305
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:46,611
And I'm like,
there's,

306
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:49,870
there's a middle road there and here's
the way I would do the middle road.

307
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,530
And it resonated with them,
you know.

308
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,490
And so we had a pretty epic conversation
for two hours.

309
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,600
Why you like,
why,

310
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:02,410
what is it about what your message was?
You're idea was,

311
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,191
um,
the,

312
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:06,760
made them something to tell you some top
secret shit that they've tried to keep

313
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:09,280
away from the American people.
When you tell your guy who was like a

314
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:12,940
big celebrity who's in a huge rock band
like you and just say,

315
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,590
Hey,
meet me in an airport.

316
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:17,380
I'm going to tell you about a life form
that we found during the Cold War.

317
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,290
Because you're famous or because you
know things?

318
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,790
No,
because I have a service,

319
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,581
so it's,
it's not a,

320
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,520
it sounds easy when you play it like
that.

321
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,410
But if service,
a service,

322
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:31,240
like what can you do for them that they
need help with communication.

323
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,640
They don't have a way to make a movie a
book.

324
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,200
They don't know.
They don't have a way to make

325
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:37,540
documentaries.
They don't have a way to go on,

326
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,870
on a big show like this and communicate
with young people.

327
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,720
They don't do that.
And nor should they,

328
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,010
they're,
they look at you gotta.

329
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,130
Look at what they're doing.
Um,

330
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,180
so they look to you for a spokesperson
role.

331
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,030
I wouldn't say spokesperson
communication,

332
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,110
role,
communication,

333
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:54,220
role.
It makes sense.

334
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,700
They would give some information to you
and you would get it out to people.

335
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,380
And now why wouldn't they do it
themselves?

336
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,690
Because they wouldn't have the same
platform.

337
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,650
They don't have the same platform.
And the other reason is as people have

338
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:09,940
tried to do movies and stuff like this,
but none of none of them know.

339
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,570
I was fortunate enough to,
to know the core story.

340
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,960
And most people don't explain that then
if you don't mind going back,

341
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,790
like you said,
that you were able to put things

342
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,890
together that other people weren't one
of those things.

343
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,630
Essentially it's the book secret
machines where you have a lot of private

344
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,930
finance,
you have some world bankers and you

345
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,390
have,
um,

346
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,460
a lot of people internationally working
together to figure out a plan of how to,

347
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,070
how to push back against something
that's been coming here for a very long

348
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:41,560
time.
But using off the books,

349
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:46,561
finances and using mechanisms that,
that we're not totally aware exist.

350
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,860
And what people have to realize is,
you know,

351
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:52,060
they,

352
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,060
the UFO phenomenon isn't a phenomenon.
There's the universe is fucking gigantic

353
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,280
and there's life everywhere,
every fucking where and,

354
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,520
and,
and there's a lot of life that's way

355
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:08,000
more advanced than we are.
And just like voyager left our solar

356
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,340
system,
a little dinky satellite from the

357
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:13,340
seventies there.
And just like,

358
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,550
my company's going to be building,
you know,

359
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,830
this,
this electromagnetic craft that really

360
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,990
can do the same thing.
The time that I've been telling you

361
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:23,420
about.
Other civilizations have that too,

362
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:27,410
which means you can traverse those
distances of space and what you have to

363
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,880
think about is what happened when we
first discovered that and what did we do

364
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,650
about it?
And there's no,

365
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,080
you know,
you've got to look at 47 in a very

366
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,870
peculiar way.
Ninety days after the Roseville event

367
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,570
with CIA was created,
the air force was separated from the

368
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:43,490
army.
The National Security Act was created

369
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,180
and all those things are mechanisms to
start learning more and to start getting

370
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,590
private industry off the ground.

371
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,450
So they're going to do with World War
II.

372
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,400
You think it had to do with aliens?
Oh,

373
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,980
I absolutely think it.
Well,

374
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,360
both because what,
uh,

375
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,850
what I believe crashed at Roswell was,
um,

376
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,610
I believe it was German from Argentina,
but it had hallmarks and technology

377
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:11,981
based on alien technology.
So we put out a story saying it's alien

378
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,330
and then we put out a story saying it's
a weather balloon,

379
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,020
but the real thing it was we didn't want
anyone to guess and that's why we put

380
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,840
those two things out there.
And that's Kinda how they do it.

381
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,940
I think they did that with the moon.
It's like,

382
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,670
you know,
we went to the moon and then they put

383
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:27,760
out this meme kind of thing,
like we can't,

384
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,030
we,
we didn't go to the moon,

385
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,650
but I didn't want people really going,
well,

386
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,570
what's on the moon that,
you know,

387
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:36,230
so these things are managed until they
can figure it out because you've got a

388
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:41,231
bunch of normal dudes in suits sitting
at a big table like this and it's their

389
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:46,391
fucking responsibility to figure this
thing out and this shit is monumentally

390
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:48,480
big.

391
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,140
Um,
but back to how they manage this.

392
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:55,160
Then how these regular dudes without
access to communication like you have,

393
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,640
how have they managed to disseminate
this information and,

394
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,810
and,
and sort of confuse everybody.

395
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,100
I think.
Well,

396
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,660
I can tell.
I don't know how they did it.

397
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,820
I do know that they infiltrated Ufo
groups.

398
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,710
That was the very first thing they did
in the fifties,

399
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,300
sort of like how FBI agents and
undercover cops infiltrated occupy Wall

400
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,870
Street yet pretended to be radical
hippies and started fights.

401
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,920
Yep.
They did that.

402
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,950
They get access to what the civilians
are learning.

403
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,540
How information transfers from one group
to another and then they start

404
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,600
deflecting all their knowledge and
putting in leaks and this and that and

405
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,370
getting them off the main track,
not because of disdain for citizens and

406
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:36,371
not because
of any other reason than picture isis.

407
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,960
We don't know what Isis is.

408
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,940
They got a nuclear bomb and we caught a
guy trying to sneak in this mom.

409
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,950
Right.
Are they going to stop and come sit on

410
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,810
your couch and tell you all about it?
No.

411
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,520
And if you're like on the radio and
there's all these people going,

412
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,390
oh my God,
we're gonna die.

413
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:51,971
Obama,
Obama,

414
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,610
Obama there.
Hold up a second.

415
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,650
You know,
you're not going to fucking die,

416
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:59,070
but we need to learn more about this and
we've got to figure it out before we sit

417
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:02,070
down and talk to you about it.
So what was the connection though

418
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,740
specifically that you had figured out
that they knew,

419
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:07,350
that you had figured out that people
hadn't put together?

420
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,340
Well,
let me just.

421
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:09,690
Okay,
so let me go back to my story.

422
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:14,190
So I put out this book and this book
deals with a book called the secret

423
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:18,870
machines and it deals with secret,
you know,

424
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,870
international finance,
private industry.

425
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,850
I'm a secret space program,
uh,

426
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,850
and a bunch of other things that your
research is both.

427
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,160
What do you mean?
How'd you get the information?

428
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,480
I was just 25 years of reading shit and
watching videos and studying physics and

429
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,780
studying,
you know,

430
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,530
the secrecy acts and all that kind of
weird shit,

431
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
you know,
you put it together and a lot of it's

432
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,680
bad information.
But,

433
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,060
uh,
after a long time I realized I just

434
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,120
realized what was going on there.
I just,

435
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,280
I've studied enough of,
of international finance,

436
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,090
some mechanisms that happen after World
War Two,

437
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,390
what the Nazis were doing
technologically that no one really talks

438
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,460
about to this day.
There were a hundred years ahead of us,

439
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,070
uh,
about what their guys did at the end of

440
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:08,100
the war and South America that's in the
paperclip.

441
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:10,680
Paperclip was like,
there's two levels of paperclip.

442
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:13,650
Paperclip is,
is the operation that brought over all

443
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:18,420
these ex Nazis into NASA and into all of
our aerospace programs.

444
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,950
Why did we do that?
Well,

445
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:24,951
because they knew some shit that was
very important and we said there might

446
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,480
be a bigger issue out there to deal
with.

447
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:32,400
So why don't we saw with the devil or
side with someone bad because there

448
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:34,530
might be a devil out there.
It's that kind of thinking.

449
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:39,000
So they come in and thought it was about
competing with Russia to try to advance

450
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,260
rocketry.
The,

451
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:42,690
I believe that there was,
um,

452
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,690
you know,
I believe that there's a reason with the

453
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:49,470
cold war never got hot is because we're
working with Russia on this specific

454
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:52,380
issue.
You think the reason why the Cold War

455
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,950
never turned into an actual war.
So we were saying yeah.

456
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,980
So it had nothing to do with the fact
that Russia was a communist empire and

457
00:19:58,981 --> 00:19:59,550
essentially,
no,

458
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,750
it did spent them and they really did,
went under and collapsed.

459
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,050
Yeah.
But there's different,

460
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,870
there's different levels.
It's like when someone goes,

461
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,300
you know,
the US government did this.

462
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,320
Well,
what do you mean?

463
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:13,050
What does that mean?
Does that mean the CIA did it or the Dod

464
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:14,790
did it?
Or Homeland Security did it.

465
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,870
You're dealing with the.
It's a trillion dollar organization.

466
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,260
It's like if somebody's in apple leaks
and iphone,

467
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,700
you know,
are you going to say,

468
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,760
oh my God at apple is doing.
Apple is like,

469
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,530
well shit,
we're a $800,000,000,000 company.

470
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,570
We have so many things going on
worldwide.

471
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,870
It's impossible to say.
The entire organization believes one

472
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,780
thing and the government's the same kind
of the same kind of way.

473
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:38,820
It's just like,
that's just a word.

474
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,570
The US government's two words,
right?

475
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,640
All right.
Three years,

476
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,010
four years.
How do we want to count this in the

477
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,880
United States government?
Three.

478
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,740
Three,
yes.

479
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,010
Okay.
US has got a,

480
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,120
you're going to find that you got to
figure this shit out.

481
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,920
But um,
and you have many,

482
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:55,330
many layers of what's going on and you
have some people worried on technology.

483
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,820
Some people worrying about what's
happening that happening to the civilian

484
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,620
population.
You have some people worrying about,

485
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,180
um,
you know,

486
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:03,790
how to keep everything afloat,
how to keep everything going.

487
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,210
And you have a whole bunch of weird
military excursions and they're bumping

488
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,060
into each other and,
and all these people aren't read in to

489
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,670
what's going on with the UFO thing.
So as all that shit.

490
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,490
So who gets read in the.
That's a good question.

491
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,220
If I had to guess.
I'm very,

492
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:23,140
very senior technical bras and rockstars
and Rhonda wasn't red in trust me.

493
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,610
They didn't tell you anything?
No.

494
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,960
Uh,
they possibly did,

495
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:29,320
but I wasn't read and read and I wasn't
brought into a skiff and they said this

496
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,720
is what's going on even though I've been
in a skiff a few times.

497
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,270
Okay.
You want to skip this?

498
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,340
A boat?
A skift is a,

499
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,950
is a special compart mentalized
information facility.

500
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,133
It's,
um,

501
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,180
it's,
we're top secret shit can be discussed.

502
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,660
I thought maybe they talk on boats
because nobody can hear you.

503
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,890
They do that too.
They do that.

504
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,450
They do that.
They actually do.

505
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,650
Because you can sweep for bugs on boats
a lot easier than you can on a building.

506
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,560
Make sense?
Yeah.

507
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,330
Yeah.
So they tell you what.

508
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,420
Okay.
So I'm sitting at that restaurant and

509
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,510
says he found a live forum where they
found a life forum during the Cold War.

510
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,710
And I,
and I said,

511
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:09,490
well,
if find it,

512
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,660
oh,
I didn't ask him that question.

513
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,450
Get many places.
I did one time bring up.

514
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:14,284
I said,
you know,

515
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,250
I'm thinking about talking about what
the crash and the late forties and they

516
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,450
go,
why just that one?

517
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,510
That was the answer.
So I had to figure out a language to

518
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,220
talk to these guys.
Do you ever think that maybe this guy is

519
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:26,230
bullshitting you or he's crazy?
No,

520
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,240
fuck no,
no,

521
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,450
you got it.
That's what you got to hear the whole

522
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:29,284
story.
So,

523
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,460
um,
okay.

524
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:32,530
So I'm sitting with them,
we talk about a lot of things.

525
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:34,480
I bring up the incidents with our
nuclear weapons.

526
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:36,430
I bring up the incidences,
a,

527
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,500
a few other things that I want to get
into.

528
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,360
And um,
and he goes,

529
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:42,610
what do you need to do your project?
What do you,

530
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,810
what are you looking for?
And I said,

531
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:44,770
well,
I need advisors,

532
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,693
you know,
uh,

533
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,130
I need people that are from different
areas.

534
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:49,480
And the government,
because everyone has their own

535
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,790
perspective,
you know,

536
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,270
you have people at the National
Reconnaissance Office that have a

537
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:58,450
perspective based on the satellite feeds
they're getting and these things are

538
00:22:58,451 --> 00:22:59,640
coming in and out of the atmosphere.

539
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,400
Then you also have people from the
agency that are worried about in

540
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,550
collecting information of what's going
on with people in different countries

541
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,540
and here,
uh,

542
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,570
but then you also have engineers that
have a perspective on how the technology

543
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:16,510
is made and what that might mean because
there's a lot of consciousness stuff

544
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:18,150
that,
that falls into this category there.

545
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,210
So there are satellites that track them
coming in and out of the atmosphere.

546
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,890
Absolutely.
Yeah,

547
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,770
absolutely.
What kinds of satellites are these?

548
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,240
Uh,
how the fuck,

549
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,250
I don't know,
usually forward looking for red,

550
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,980
but I don't know what spectrum of the
infrared they're looking at.

551
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,130
So there is some sort of a camera or
some sort of a detection device that

552
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,730
they have in the atmosphere just to
check for Ufo.

553
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,130
I don't know if it's just for you
iphones,

554
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,540
they can pick up very,
very specific heat signatures and they

555
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:52,541
have algorithms because what you have is
a satellite is a device that can pick up

556
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:56,270
what you,
what you program it to pick up.

557
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,030
Now you know,
you put a sensor on there but you got to

558
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:02,120
tell the sensor what to do.
So if the sensor says,

559
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:05,480
look something traveling at this speed
with this kind of heat,

560
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,610
you know,
you gotta record that you got to focus

561
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:11,710
on it and that's what we call an icbm.
But if something comes in and zigzag

562
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,660
stops and turns left and traveling 10
times faster than that,

563
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,760
we need you to record that and focusing
on that as well.

564
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,230
But if something just as moving low and
it's only going 300 miles an hour and it

565
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:23,180
has these big wings and Alo,
whatever,

566
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:24,470
they're all just a plain,
you know.

567
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:27,470
So the,
what it captures is based on,

568
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,920
you know,
how it's programmed in the first place,

569
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,640
but we can differentiate between media
rights and.

570
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,520
Absolutely,
yes.

571
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,440
Absolutely.
So okay.

572
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,340
So how often are these things coming
into?

573
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,050
Our Atmosphere,
oh shit,

574
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:39,940
I don't know,
but I,

575
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,200
I've had quite a few discussions.
I'm,

576
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:45,940
one of the people I've been,
I've been in contact with,

577
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,920
one of my advisors for was from the
national reconnaissance office,

578
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,010
high up,
high,

579
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:53,720
high up and um,
they call it episodic visits.

580
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:57,270
That's all I know.
Episodic have time periods where they,

581
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,610
like,
there was,

582
00:24:58,611 --> 00:25:01,460
I saw a paper where they semesters,
I figured out,

583
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,360
um,
the department of fence figured out a

584
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,210
physicist there,
an algorithm of how to compute when the

585
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:12,070
things fly in,
in collect smaller ships like mothership

586
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,490
small ships.
What,

587
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,520
what at what longitude and latitude in,
in what essentially what orbit it would

588
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:20,930
land at when it would collect these
other machines.

589
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,230
And um,
so they tested that and in all I know is

590
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,320
it was successful.
They would think this is happening on a

591
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,550
very frequent basis.

592
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,350
Well,
let me tell you the rest of the story.

593
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,160
So I,
I,

594
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,971
uh,
and this is,

595
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:35,060
it's important because you'll see 'em.
So he goes,

596
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:35,661
what do you need?
I said,

597
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,310
I need to advisors.
And then,

598
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,480
uh,
so next thing you know,

599
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,730
I leave and two weeks later,
Bam,

600
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:41,121
Bam,
Bam,

601
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:43,370
my email starts.
I have all these admirals,

602
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:44,390
all these generals,
no,

603
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,320
no intelligence people other than,
other than bras that were connected with

604
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:49,880
the national reconnaissance office.
But,

605
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,670
um,
Nashville office has half air force and

606
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:54,740
half CIA.
Um,

607
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,690
but they're all,
they're all military.

608
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,350
And so I start talking to them,
I start meeting with them,

609
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:05,351
I fly out to Colorado Springs and
there's a general and a colonel and they

610
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,260
look at me and they said,
uh,

611
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,420
they said,
okay,

612
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:09,920
do you need anything else?
Are you good?

613
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:10,760
And I said,
well,

614
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,040
I think you guys should talk to the
defense intelligence agency.

615
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,873
And they go,
why?

616
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,500
I'm all,
I just don't want to upset them.

617
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,050
I want to make sure everyone's kosher
with what I'm about to do.

618
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,720
And uh,
the kernel looks at me and he goes,

619
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:23,630
do you ask your dad for permission after
your mom's already given it to you?

620
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:24,261
And I go,
no.

621
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:25,670
And he's all,
you've been given permission,

622
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,380
shut the fuck up and get to work.
And I was like,

623
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,940
alright.
So I did,

624
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,870
so I go out and I put the book out there
and I started doing national radio,

625
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:34,420
like the art bill,
so coast to coast.

626
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,290
Ordinarily I do all that stuff.
Next thing you know,

627
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:41,291
I get approached by somebody with a,
at a certain agency and that guy comes

628
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:43,290
to San Diego and puts me in a small
room,

629
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,370
uh,

630
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,370
and I got a,
what you would call interrogated for two

631
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:51,560
days straight saying,
um,

632
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,450
we need to know who the fuck you are.
You know,

633
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:56,470
shit you shouldn't know.
And uh,

634
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,980
what like what specifically should you
not have known?

635
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,210
I don't know what the book,
what's in the book,

636
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,570
everything I've been telling you today
when you're dealing with there,

637
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:09,810
there is a,
there is a concerted international

638
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:14,010
effort to deal with this stuff.
And that was in my book and that is,

639
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,460
it's not like Roswell crashed and it was
not like,

640
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,430
you know,
like all the typical Ufo Shit that

641
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:24,030
people dwell on isn't the story.
It's just that there's something crashed

642
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,810
or someone saw got abducted and saw this
or someone pulled a little piece of

643
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:31,230
metal out of their body,
but no one's put together what we're

644
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:33,240
doing about it because our,
our,

645
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,940
our countrymen since World War Two
aren't stupid,

646
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,770
is what set them off there.

647
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,330
Like,
what was the thing that you said that

648
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:42,720
you should not have known the A in my
book,

649
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,350
it is my belief,
uh,

650
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,930
that we have an incredible,
um,

651
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,290
we've made incredible strides creating a
assets to deal with this stuff.

652
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,200
That's,
that's my belief and I'm not speaking

653
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,250
for my company.
That's just nonsense.

654
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,300
Yeah.
I mean some sort of government agency

655
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:06,510
that has been designed or other
international international.

656
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,550
Okay.
So some sort of an international

657
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:13,320
collaboration to deal with the threat of
alien life and that was enough that they

658
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:15,900
pulled you aside from wouldn't let you
go for two days and just.

659
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,200
Yeah.
So it was the,

660
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,580
it was more,
it was an interrogation,

661
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:24,390
but it was a pretty heavy,
heavy debriefing of how I got to where I

662
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:26,040
was.
And it's not like they didn't let me go

663
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:29,100
home.
This took place at a hotel near my home,

664
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,020
but they made you sit down and talk to
them.

665
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,800
Oh fuck.
Yeah,

666
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,560
I had.
There was a six of them I think six

667
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,560
until they let you leave and go to sleep
and then come back,

668
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,750
get something.
Came back,

669
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,860
spent another eight hours because I
wasn't rogue.

670
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:43,910
I wasn't like trying to hide anything.
I was trying to explain to the.

671
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:45,450
How did you have all this free time
though?

672
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,070
What do you mean?
I mean,

673
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,750
have you ever like if somebody said,
hey,

674
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:51,000
we're going to have you in a room,
we're going to talk to you for two days.

675
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:51,541
I'm like,
dude,

676
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:54,080
I don't have two days or that's,
that's well that's.

677
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,860
Maybe you don't,
but if you do,

678
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,410
I'd fuck you out.
When you have these people that want to

679
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:59,730
get ahold of you,
you don't run.

680
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,290
I'm not saying run.
I'm saying like,

681
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,030
what are you guys looking for?
Like you,

682
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,640
they're going to just sit you down and
ask you questions for two days because

683
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:09,090
you put together this idea that somehow
or another there's some sort of an

684
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:11,820
international collaboration deal with
the threat of million life.

685
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,390
No,
they,

686
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,890
they,
they looked at it.

687
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,590
They didn't know they thought I was at
snowden.

688
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,440
They thought I was.
They thought there was a group of people

689
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,920
leaking classified information.
They didn't know that you're from blink

690
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:25,140
one 82.
They didn't know that you like a huge.

691
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,900
They don't care about rockstar.
That's what they don't understand.

692
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,990
They don't care about who I am,
they just care about the material.

693
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,240
Right.
But it should take them like three

694
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,670
seconds to realize you're not Edward
Snowden,

695
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,110
you're a rockstar.
But I,

696
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,150
but I'm saying some pretty provocative
shit.

697
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,160
You got to realize no one else has

698
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,220
gone up there and talked about,
you know.

699
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,450
Once again,
I,

700
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,160
I'm in a tricky spot right now because a
lot of what happened back then,

701
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,890
you know,
I can't really get into now because of

702
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,660
the positions and the things I'm
involved with,

703
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,440
but read the book.
And so it was just because you printed

704
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:02,530
this stuff in the book that they wanted
to pull you aside and talk to you about

705
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:05,230
this for two days.
And I was all over radio and talking

706
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:07,870
about it and I was saying some other
crazy shit that I can't repeat.

707
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,030
So people listening,
if they want to go back and look at

708
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:11,350
those interviews,
that's a better way to.

709
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,820
Okay.
So you had said something in those

710
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:16,000
interviews that you can't say again
because they told you to stop talking

711
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:16,990
about it.
Absolutely,

712
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,640
yeah.
They tell you to stop talking about the

713
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:20,020
fact that you can't talk about it.

714
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,460
No,
I mean,

715
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,040
I don't think that's the issue.
They,

716
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,080
the more of the issue was what are you
trying to achieve?

717
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,840
And once they found out who I was
working with,

718
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,920
they were like,
Holy Shit.

719
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,220
And they only found that out when
wikileaks broke into John Podesta's

720
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:40,750
emails in my.
I was having video conferences and

721
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,780
conference calls with,
uh,

722
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,740
he was Obama's senior advisor at the
time.

723
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:46,450
So the Wall Street Journal broke the
story.

724
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,050
Like,
what's this rock star talking about Ufos

725
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,370
with Hillary.
Hillary Clinton's campaign manager,

726
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,760
no,
he was Obama's senior advisor so I had

727
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:55,900
nothing to do with Hillary,
you know,

728
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:59,950
so we were setting these up and when
that broke I had to call up my partner

729
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:02,520
from the CIA and I said,
you know,

730
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,350
I got to say,
I know I got no,

731
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,510
I can talk to you a little bit more
about who these people are.

732
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:12,880
And um,
and that's where I gained a really large

733
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:17,300
amount of credibility with them,
but also where they realized that we got

734
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:22,301
to figure out a better way to do this
and what you see is me and some very

735
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:26,620
important people coming together to do
something that I think is really

736
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:29,620
beneficial to society.
But a lot we have a lot of work to do

737
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,230
because a lot of people think they don't
know what to think of it.

738
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:34,270
At first they thought I was nuts when I
was talking about my book.

739
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:34,900
I'm all,
Oh God,

740
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,400
these advisors,
you know.

741
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,640
And then all of a sudden the Wall Street
Journal broke this story and there's all

742
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:44,641
these multi star generals and head of
some really big aerospace companies.

743
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:47,380
And then,
then the big news organizations were

744
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:49,480
like,
Holy Shit,

745
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:50,680
this is,
this might be real.

746
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:53,260
A lot of kids still don't know and
they're having fun on the Internet.

747
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,140
Um,
and then I came out a couple of weeks

748
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,860
ago on stage with all these people.
Now it's like now all the big huge.

749
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:02,490
I'm dealing with some crazy big
mainstream press that,

750
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,260
that we're trying to keep at bay for a
variety of reasons.

751
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,610
Um,
but yes,

752
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:11,440
it's all true.
And what to the stars is really after is

753
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,830
how do we,
how do we bring the public in on this

754
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,420
and work together to,
to communicate and educate this stuff.

755
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,080
How do we bring the technology out of
the shadows and build it for the world?

756
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,090
Um,
and how do we,

757
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,740
uh,
you know,

758
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,130
tell the story in documentaries,
nonfiction,

759
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:33,340
fictional works over a period of years.
And if we do that,

760
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:35,620
the public owns it.
The public has a say,

761
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,260
they're a part of it.
And then people will start to understand

762
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:40,100
over time why they did what they did.

763
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,660
They didn't lie to people,
uh,

764
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,560
just out of like ego.
It's they are like,

765
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,540
okay,
there's this group called Isis and

766
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,840
they're here and we need to understand
them and we need to fucking figure it

767
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:52,290
out quick.
Uh,

768
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,210
but the problem is these are
extraordinarily advanced civilizations

769
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:59,480
that have been coming here forever.
That's why it's all in all the ancient

770
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,340
fucking scripts and texts and carved
into the rocks and all that shit.

771
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,250
Um,
but trying to figure it out,

772
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,620
trying to connect the dots and trying
to.

773
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,030
I mean looking at debris that they
probably still have in a warehouse

774
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,430
going,
we have no fucking clue how to,

775
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,830
how to make this or back engineer this
stuff.

776
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:24,070
I mean there's a piece of metal from a
crash that I've seen and I've seen the

777
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:29,711
science on it and it's,
it's so it's atomically aligned and it's

778
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:33,770
layered and multi,
like 80 layers within just a few microns

779
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,120
of purities of metal that,
that aren't even in our solar system.

780
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,950
And they think it needs to be made in,
in an area where there's no gravity.

781
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:44,480
So number one,
it has to be made in space.

782
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,500
Number two,
even if we were to create a machine that

783
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:52,970
can potentially do some of this stuff,
three d printing layers of different

784
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:57,290
metals that have obscene purities,
it would cost hundreds and hundreds of

785
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:59,000
millions of dollars.
We don't even have that.

786
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,980
Why did they think it was made without
gravity?

787
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,120
Because,
uh,

788
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,410
I think it's the atomic structure.
So what happens is,

789
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:08,510
is when you radiate it with Terahertz,
it loses mass,

790
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,700
something weird,
it resonates,

791
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,690
some kind of harmonic and then it gets
lighter and if you hit it with enough

792
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:15,650
terahertz,
it'll float.

793
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,780
So we're going to be showing people this
stuff.

794
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:20,090
We're going to be bringing out the
hardware.

795
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,250
Some of the hard work will be bringing
out implants that are going to be

796
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:23,000
bringing up videos.

797
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,350
We're going to be bringing in showing
people this actual physical piece of

798
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:31,160
metal that was constructed in a zero
gravity environment and space.

799
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,790
And if you hit it with enough energy,
it becomes weightless.

800
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,020
Now,
I wouldn't say wait list.

801
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:37,820
I don't know if we can make enough
energy to do that.

802
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,460
But yes,
that is our plan in not only show the

803
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:44,330
experiment.
So if you can't give it enough energy to

804
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:47,630
make it weightless,
can you give it enough energy to reduce

805
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:48,500
the mass?
Yes.

806
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:50,060
So it weighs less.
Yes.

807
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,530
And you can prove this.
Yes.

808
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:55,280
And that's why I didn't have a scale.
And you can put this piece of do scale.

809
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:56,300
I'll do you better.
It's not,

810
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,810
it's not even that.
It's warping the space time continuum

811
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,310
around the objects.
So you shoot.

812
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,010
What you can do is you can shoot an
electron over it.

813
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,310
Why?
It's why it's not a single electron and

814
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:10,760
you collect it in time that how do you
shoot a single electron final?

815
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:12,380
I'm not physicists.
They just do this shit.

816
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,700
That's what they do.
So.

817
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:15,380
And I was actually on a phone call today
about it.

818
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,000
I talked for about 45 minutes in the car
on the way up here about some of the,

819
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,220
some of the.
How would they even be able to regulate

820
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,700
whether or not they have a single
electron will do.

821
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,690
Fuck.
They're doing crazier shit than that at

822
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:27,720
cern.
At cern,

823
00:35:27,721 --> 00:35:31,550
they're taking particles of atoms and
they're speeding them up to light speed.

824
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,570
Almost lights.
Yeah.

825
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:35,720
And slamming them into each other.
So I'm not too worried about electron

826
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,190
electrons and photons.
Ms Dot building.

827
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,990
That's,
I think it's sirens like 10 miles in the

828
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:44,850
lab.
Have you seen an electron microscope?

829
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,390
Right.
It's like the size of half of this too,

830
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:49,980
but I'm saying they're launching a
single electron at this thing.

831
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,470
I think that's what they do.
Yeah,

832
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,810
they do that with photons too,
by the way.

833
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,540
I read,
I read a really cool study about single

834
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:00,660
photons and consciousness was
interacting with it.

835
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,510
Just just by thinking it was changing
the way the photon went.

836
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,030
It's crazy.
So what happens is,

837
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,720
is you shoot this electron and you know
how fast it is to travel over this piece

838
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:11,010
of metal.
Then you,

839
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,910
then you radiate it with terahertz and
then you shouldn't mean radiated with

840
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,740
time.
You're,

841
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,610
you're your electrifying and charging
the piece of material noted terahertz.

842
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,460
It's,
it's a,

843
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,700
it's a high frequency wave.
I don't want to pretend I know that much

844
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:24,090
about it.

845
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:29,090
I just know that the earlier tests were
with radio waves like rf and uh,

846
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,060
and they need to do terahertz.
So I,

847
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,370
I don't know much more than that,
so and so by radio,

848
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,430
by shooting terahertz at it,
the piece of metal can lose mass and

849
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:42,960
then when you shoot an electron over it,
it'll be a different time than the other

850
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:44,850
one when it's not turned on.
Does that make sense?

851
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,370
No.
The time it takes for an electron to go

852
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,980
over the piece of metal.
What's that?

853
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,640
Jamie's been terahertz imaging,
laser guided codes,

854
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:57,000
advanced single pixel tele terahertz
imagery,

855
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:02,570
and this be the images sampled upon
instructions from a laser,

856
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,380
a the terahertz light passes through the
object and then see the information is

857
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:11,070
collected to reconstruct the image.
Look at that.

858
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,460
So with this stuff,
just an imaging technique,

859
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:19,200
you're timing how fast it takes an
electron to move over the surface of the

860
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:19,920
metal.

861
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,430
Then you charge the metal and then your
timing the exact same thing and there

862
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:27,630
will be different times and the positive
result is that it lost mass so it

863
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:30,810
traveled faster or slow or whatever the
hell is supposed to happen.

864
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:33,870
So,
and so I would imagine that this,

865
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,180
just this piece of metal,
if it exists,

866
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:40,680
would be kind of game over if you
brought this piece of metal to the most

867
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:44,760
advanced scientists and metallurgy or
whatever they would be that would

868
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:46,210
understand this kind of shit.
Yeah.

869
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,780
And it had already been there.
But the problem is,

870
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:51,240
is there anywhere online where people
can read about this,

871
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,560
there actually is.
There's some,

872
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,310
some of this stuff,
not this piece in particular that came

873
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:59,910
out as arts parts on arts bell a long
time ago and there are different layers

874
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,700
of business and magnesium.
But I uh,

875
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
but this one came from a crash in 48,
not 47 and I know nothing more about it,

876
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:11,820
but I don't think it's anything that can
come in here with the chain of custody

877
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:14,460
and say this came from air force or
something like that.

878
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,230
You know,
I don't know who has this.

879
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,200
So you're going to bring this and
demonstrate this to people.

880
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:20,340
Yeah.
And the reason is,

881
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:23,550
is because we need to.
We're also going to show,

882
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,060
um,
videos that just got declassified from

883
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,960
our most advanced systems,
I think they call it the Aegis Aegis

884
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:33,540
system.
It's a radar system and forward looking

885
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,980
for red of Ufo is have those in
possession

886
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,530
actually already.
And so we're going to show the videos

887
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,480
that just,
I mean the first time in history,

888
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:43,660
by the way,
that videos of Ufo iphones have been

889
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:46,210
declassified.
There's been leaks and there has been

890
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:49,180
people catching shit on their phones,
but I have all the chain of custody,

891
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:52,750
all the documents and everything and we
just got those a few weeks ago and

892
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:56,470
there's a shitload more common.
And so we'll release the videos and

893
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:58,690
we'll show the experiment as a proof of
concept.

894
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,420
So everyone knows the shits all rail
because right now they're just looking

895
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:03,730
at a drawing and they're looking at this
guy from the skunk works,

896
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,751
you know,
and just going,

897
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:08,560
how the fuck are they going to build a
machine that plays with time and plays

898
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:12,220
with the fabric of space time.
And so we have to kind of educate people

899
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,690
and say it's possible.
It's possible.

900
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,820
And yeah,
that's it.

901
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,860
They're advanced electro gravitt.
Gravitic propulsion is that.

902
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,420
I say that electrogravitics gravitic.
So what that does,

903
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:28,780
what the machine does that we're
building is there's A.

904
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:33,460
There's an electromagnetic wave that is
the foundation of everything,

905
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:34,750
of all mass,
of everything.

906
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:37,270
Like it's.
Some people call it zero point energy,

907
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:42,420
some people call it a the vacuum energy,
but like one inch of air could power the

908
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,510
United States for like hundreds of years
kind of thing or maybe more.

909
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,700
So what they got to do is isolate very
specific atoms to where all the noise of

910
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:54,670
all matter and cell phones and
everything that's going on on earth can

911
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:57,850
be,
can be separated from this one Adam.

912
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,670
And if you can do that with the right
material,

913
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,480
you can get access to that
electromagnetic wave that's powering the

914
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:05,260
atom,
the,

915
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,690
the,
the invisible wave pattern that that's

916
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:09,490
under everything of all existence.

917
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,940
And once you do that,
it's not like splitting an atom.

918
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,980
This is the power behind the atom.
It's extraordinarily dangerous,

919
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,780
but it's also what will turn that thing
on and it'll turn into a ball of light

920
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,300
and just disappear.
And I could show you a video of,

921
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,670
of something doing that that's actually
on youtube,

922
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,570
you know,
told me what it is.

923
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,300
Who Goal I would.
I would have to,

924
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,640
I could search it for a second.
How about this?

925
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,260
Well,
there's no commercial breaks.

926
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:36,094
Is there?
No.

927
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,550
Oh fuck.
Just search it up.

928
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,680
I'll just describe it.
You know what,

929
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,990
if you type in,
um,

930
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,280
Astra,
uh,

931
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,800
the tr three,
be astro,

932
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:52,560
tr three B
and I'll walk over there and walk over

933
00:40:52,561 --> 00:40:53,820
there for a second show in which one is.
Yes,

934
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,763
go ahead.

935
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,100
Gone to so we can all talk to each
other.

936
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,060
So what you want to do is come down here
and do your people get to a.

937
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,560
there'll be able to see it.
We'll put it up on the screen.

938
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,871
So what,
what?

939
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:12,500
This is
why I don't really want to tell you what

940
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:13,760
it is.
What I want you to watch it.

941
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,600
I'll find it for you.
Just takes me a second.

942
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,690
There's a bunch of bullshit.
This is the craft by the way.

943
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,590
And if you spell it right,
astro,

944
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:29,424
that's why.
Sorry.

945
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,960
Astra Astra.
Not Astro.

946
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,770
You're typing in at home.
He's got to get.

947
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:37,421
We got to get me.
Sure.

948
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:38,254
It's the right one.

949
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,420
We're looking on youtube.
Ladies and gentlemen,

950
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:42,680
if you're in your car right now,
going,

951
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:47,360
what the fuck is going on in this show?
Most the vast majority of the people

952
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:51,230
just listened to this show.
So for the people that are just

953
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:53,300
listening and you want to go check it
out,

954
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,330
t are 38,
Astra Aurora project through s a f o

955
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,980
three b.
sorry.

956
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,190
This is the craft in secret machines,
but that's all I'm going to say.

957
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,240
This thing is floating in the air.
It'll take a few seconds till they turn

958
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:12,194
on the engine.

959
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,540
Well,
it looks pretty bad ass.

960
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,400
I don't wait.
You can see little lights dancing around

961
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:21,090
on the bottom,
but I think this was leaked on purpose

962
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:24,900
because the guy's making a just hard
enough to see moving the camera around

963
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,960
in and out of focus.
It's got like he's barely focusing soy.

964
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:32,160
That looks like a drone.
Well,

965
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,290
it looks small to.
It's not.

966
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,840
It's pretty big.
I would think that one's about 40 feet.

967
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:37,600
Really?
Look,

968
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,680
see the tail fins on the back.
That's how you know it's not alien per

969
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:41,730
se.
It's built off.

970
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:46,010
I think technology that came from there,
but you know,

971
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,080
they don't need vertical tail.
Stabilize that big light.

972
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,700
Okay.
This is the engine they turn it on.

973
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,390
So right now they're at.
They're accessing that energy I told you

974
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:55,980
about now and watch what happens.

975
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,063
It's gone.

976
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,670
There's a pilot in that.
If that was in a movie,

977
00:43:00,671 --> 00:43:04,840
I'd want my money back.
This movie can suck my Dick.

978
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,410
Why?
Why?

979
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,480
Like so fake.
Oh that don't look fate.

980
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,150
What does that tr three beers.
These ones,

981
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,660
the other ones are the same one,
but these ones are stacked and that's a

982
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:16,210
drone that came out of one.
That's a drone.

983
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,090
The small one is have the little thing
that came out the side.

984
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,140
Yeah,
but if you.

985
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:23,080
You can look up black triangle Ufo and
find hundreds of these videos.

986
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:28,150
So these are a people look civilians
that are getting this from the ground

987
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,440
filming this.
I don't know.

988
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,240
I don't know where this one came.
One came from.

989
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,940
This is not the same account as the last
video.

990
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,350
Different video ended up next because
it's probably a tr three wii video.

991
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,300
How many views is out $474,000.

992
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,100
Now there's sundry.
There's so many people know now.

993
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,770
There's hundreds of these out there,
but what separates from the other one?

994
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,800
But everyone thinks everyone thinks I'm
it's alien and that's not my belief.

995
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,090
So you think this is something along the
lines,

996
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,070
like when they had the stealth bomber
program,

997
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,510
they were experimenting with these
things.

998
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,330
What do you think of Robert Lazaro?
Do you think that guy's real?

999
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,360
I'm putting out his autobiography.
So you do think he's legit and you

1000
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,260
should read his book?
Yeah.

1001
00:44:05,261 --> 00:44:06,094
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

1002
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,440
Yeah.
He's a fascinating character,

1003
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:09,850
right?
He is.

1004
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,440
He is.
His story is really interesting to where

1005
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,940
he really fucked up though.
So for the people that don't know that

1006
00:44:15,941 --> 00:44:17,980
are listening,
he's a guy that came out.

1007
00:44:17,981 --> 00:44:21,880
He's the reason we know about area 51.
He literally is,

1008
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,420
is,
is the guy that broke the story of its

1009
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:30,200
existence.
He got brought in for a job and that

1010
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,250
during the they said we have another

1011
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,430
idea for you,
and they put them in a,

1012
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,150
a place he claims had all these disks
and he was on a back engineering team as

1013
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:40,450
a physicist.
Um,

1014
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,500
but what happened was they rushed him in
there because per his story,

1015
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,090
they tried to cut into one of the
propulsion devices and it exploded and

1016
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:51,240
killed a bunch of scientists.
So the Nevada test site,

1017
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:54,720
which is the area where area 51 and all
that stuff is released a statement that

1018
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:56,460
they were just doing a small little nuke
test,

1019
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,150
but it was really because of this thing.
And so they rushed him in there without

1020
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:03,120
doing all of his background checks
because it takes six months to a year.

1021
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,373
And,
uh,

1022
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,290
during those background checks,
he was already working on this stuff.

1023
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,520
They,
um,

1024
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,230
they found that his wife was going a
little haywire because he couldn't tell

1025
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:14,430
her what she was,
what he was doing.

1026
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,780
And he would leave in the middle of the
night.

1027
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:18,210
He'd be gone for a week and she was
getting fed up.

1028
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,810
And so she started having an affair and
so they're listening in all the phone

1029
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:23,850
calls and checking them out and I kind
of go on his home.

1030
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:26,670
Life is unstable,
so they stopped calling him to come into

1031
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,860
work while they figure it out.
He knows.

1032
00:45:28,861 --> 00:45:30,870
I mean he's working next to a guy with a
machine gun.

1033
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,240
He knows that,
uh,

1034
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:36,600
that this is no fucking joke.
It no one knows what he's been doing.

1035
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:41,370
And he thought he did something wrong.
So as the nervous individual he is,

1036
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:44,670
he runs to his friends and says,
this is what I've been doing.

1037
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,860
This is what I've been working on.
There's alien craft.

1038
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,950
It's over here at groom lake.
And the tests are every Wednesday night

1039
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,810
at 8:00.
And his wife goes,

1040
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:52,644
Holy Shit.

1041
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,060
And his friend goes,
Holy Shit.

1042
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:54,751
And he goes,
come on,

1043
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,310
I'll show you.
It's,

1044
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,720
they drive three hours north of Vegas,
outs on public land.

1045
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:01,890
And they videotape and watch these ufos
come up and be tested and dart around

1046
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:03,360
and disappear.
And he goes,

1047
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,220
that's the one I'm working on.
And it's almost like,

1048
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,300
well,
how did you know what time?

1049
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:07,470
Because I'm working on it,
well,

1050
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:09,420
he does this three times.
I think it was three times and on the

1051
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:11,190
third time they got caught because
there's,

1052
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,240
I've been there,
there's security that,

1053
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,750
that travels those mountains.
You always hear about those guys out

1054
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,910
there and area 51,
when they caught him,

1055
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,040
they were like,
holy fuck.

1056
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,330
He's.
He's like,

1057
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,130
what the fuck is he doing?
You know,

1058
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:26,580
why is he telling everything?
So he runs to the new station with

1059
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:28,650
George Knapp who another,
another,

1060
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:32,310
um,
he's a host on coast to coast and he

1061
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:36,600
tells him what he's doing and he just
goes live on Las Vegas news and it

1062
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:38,290
caught like wildfire fire,
uh,

1063
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:39,870
across the world.

1064
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,480
And so then these guys grabbed him,
put him in a room,

1065
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:45,600
put a gun to his head and said,
when we told you not to say anything,

1066
00:46:45,601 --> 00:46:47,760
we didn't mean say everything,
you know.

1067
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,380
And uh,
he got really scared.

1068
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,200
They started fucking with them.
I was actually at a meeting two nights

1069
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:53,580
ago talking about some of the things
they did.

1070
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:55,830
One of the things he did,
he went to a gym he used to.

1071
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,650
He didn't have access to a lot of guns,
but if for some fucking reason he had

1072
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:00,720
like an Uzi,
it was in his glove compartment.

1073
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,600
He goes to a gym and he comes out and
his car doors are open,

1074
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:06,480
the glove compartment is open,
and the Uzi just sitting on his chair,

1075
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,080
he got a,
he got shot out on the freeway and they

1076
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:12,170
erased a bunch of his records.
Uh,

1077
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,190
and he still to this day really nervous
about it.

1078
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,010
He,
he always claimed he put for a while.

1079
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:19,530
He claimed he had,
part of this is what I will say.

1080
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:24,531
He claimed the energy source was an
element that was very heavy and it was

1081
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:26,400
like on a pentium or something like
that.

1082
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:30,220
One 15 element and a 25 years ago he
talked

1083
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,053
all about it.
He's.

1084
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,970
And then literally three years ago,
maybe four,

1085
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,120
they added it to the periodic table.
What is this stuff called again?

1086
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,700
I think it's called underpin am.
It's one element.

1087
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:41,480
One 15.
It's on.

1088
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,420
And that's the other thing is people
don't realize,

1089
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,190
Holy Shit,
25 years ago,

1090
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:47,950
he says,
this element comes from a binary star

1091
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:50,770
system and it's really heavy.
There's a certain isotope that stable,

1092
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,540
they'll find it.
And then all of a sudden,

1093
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:55,810
I remember one day I was driving my car
and I heard it like on CNN new element

1094
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:57,100
added to the periodic table.
I was like,

1095
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,450
Holy Shit,
you know.

1096
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,300
But it's pretty interesting.
Crazy story.

1097
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,850
Well,
they erased his history.

1098
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,650
What is the claim that he had raised his
educational record?

1099
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,740
Well,
I think he might have people.

1100
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:13,680
I don't know if I think this is,
I don't even,

1101
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,920
I don't know,
I never researched it,

1102
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:17,680
but people that I know that have
researched,

1103
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:20,020
I think he might have kind of upgraded
his residence,

1104
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:22,840
his resume a little bit and maybe he
didn't go to mit.

1105
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,170
That was the claim.
But they also said that he really did

1106
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,000
work for a.
what's that

1107
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,340
New Mexico?
Uh,

1108
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,270
well,
Lawrence livermore and jpl.

1109
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,160
Jpl,
jpl in Pasadena.

1110
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,043
Yeah.
But,

1111
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,961
well,
whatever it was,

1112
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:40,350
it was in New Mexico that they had found
that he actually did work in the

1113
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,090
building even though they tried to say
that he didn't.

1114
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,720
Oh yeah.
Maybe I did something with somebody and

1115
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,750
however much of his store was true,
always gets fishy when you find one

1116
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,840
thing that's not true like that he
didn't go to mit and Freedom Stanton,

1117
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,650
Stanton Friedman,
who's a very famous UFO researcher.

1118
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,360
He's one of the main guys arguing that
Bob was ours full of Shit.

1119
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,081
Yeah.
You know,

1120
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:07,920
what's interesting is there is,
there is a,

1121
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:10,140
um,
I know that guy that did all the

1122
00:49:10,141 --> 00:49:14,080
research on that and I know that guy
that studied it for decades and uh,

1123
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,860
he's actually writing a forward on the
book.

1124
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:21,861
It's the journalist has one like eight
peabody awards and Emmys and shit.

1125
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,180
But uh,
George Knapp,

1126
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,070
who I told you about and he's just got,
like,

1127
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:30,690
he could speak for hours on that entire
funds on the coast to coast show,

1128
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:32,610
right?
He doesn't like a couple Sundays each

1129
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,870
month.
And I find that element.

1130
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,010
What does it element 1:15,
is that what it's called?

1131
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,160
Popular mechanics article about it.

1132
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,720
Welcome element 1:15 now.
What's your real name?

1133
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,320
Researchers create element 1:15,
the lab for the second time over the

1134
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:52,710
first time over all in the first time in
a decade,

1135
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,250
paving the way for its official status
as a member of the periodic table.

1136
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,910
And so google,
Bob Lasar element 1:15 because I would

1137
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:02,910
think that if he knew that like that
long ago,

1138
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,550
like that alone would make people want
to take them more seriously.

1139
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,800
All the stuff that he said.
Well first of all,

1140
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:11,280
we know that there was a groom lake.
We know that there is an area 51 we know

1141
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:15,090
they denied its existence and so they
wanted to expand the perimeter to till

1142
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:19,470
they wanted to because people would sit
on a ledge and they would watch all

1143
00:50:19,471 --> 00:50:21,990
these test flights of whatever the fuck
they had.

1144
00:50:21,991 --> 00:50:24,480
Whatever it was they were doing,
whether working on stealth bombers,

1145
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:27,620
whatever it was,
people would film this and so they

1146
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:27,980
wanted to

1147
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,060
expand the perimeter of prohibited area.
And so in doing so,

1148
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:34,400
they had to admit the existence of the
base itself.

1149
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,350
I believe that was in the nineties,
right?

1150
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,450
Um,
it was in the nineties.

1151
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:41,810
They expanded the perimeter.
Something else that the government had

1152
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:45,340
to do is they had to admit you have
photos are real because there was a um,

1153
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,780
some military people look at it.
Yeah.

1154
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,840
He talks about 1:15 all through this
year.

1155
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,840
This Jamie doesn't say the video on the
bottom.

1156
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:55,820
What is it?
When was this put out?

1157
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,290
This video?
Well,

1158
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:00,620
this one is 2015,
but the video is taken on vhs.

1159
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,380
Holy Fuck.
This is 1990.

1160
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,700
Maybe it's on the Scifi channel.
Back when it was spelled Saifai.

1161
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,120
Yeah.
Everyone uses a lot.

1162
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,820
That's why f Y.
Yeah.

1163
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,350
That's old as fuck.
Yeah.

1164
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,860
Played some of that though,
because that dude's a trip because he's

1165
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:17,690
one of those weird guys where if you're,
even,

1166
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:20,990
if you're a skeptical guy,
you listen to bibles are talking like

1167
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,810
sky is obviously smart as fuck.

1168
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:30,050
Here we go in the top of the reactor,
and the base of the reactor apparently

1169
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,500
is
something similar to a cyclotron.

1170
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,920
If the particle accelerator a,
a particle is accelerated the high speed

1171
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:46,730
and then deflect it up a small tube and
it's aimed at the 1:15,

1172
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,490
this transmute the 1:15.
Uh,

1173
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:54,600
similar to the way we do that in a
normal particle accelerator,

1174
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:01,250
this causes a reaction or radiation
emission that we really haven't seen

1175
00:52:01,381 --> 00:52:03,020
before.
Um,

1176
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,950
it produces annie matter.
This Annie matter is guided down,

1177
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:11,670
attuned to,
and reacts with a gap

1178
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,030
when matter in any matter,
react,

1179
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:20,031
they convert to 100 percent energy.
This energy is converted,

1180
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,990
heat energy is converted to electrical
power,

1181
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,780
and the reactor itself.
This was done through a

1182
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:34,230
thermoelectric converting.
And this electrical power is used to

1183
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:38,360
power other subsystems on the craft.
Though there is no wiring as we would

1184
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,660
know it also.
That's almost a byproduct of the

1185
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:45,840
reactor.
The reactor also sets up a gravitational

1186
00:52:45,841 --> 00:52:50,310
wave from the 1:15 being bombarded this
gravitational wave,

1187
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:54,240
it was present at the top of the reactor
and it is essentially guided in the same

1188
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:58,490
way microwaves are guided through tune
tubes and uh,

1189
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,950
this goes to and they're amplifying
cavities and through the projectors that

1190
00:53:01,951 --> 00:53:02,940
are in the bottom of the crap.

1191
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,250
God,
I wish I was smart enough to know

1192
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,020
whether he's full of Shit.
Well,

1193
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:11,370
so what he's saying is that there's a
gravity wave that's accessible on,

1194
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,110
on a really large element that extends
beyond the perimeter of the atom.

1195
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,190
And when you bombard that,
that element with one particle Kinda

1196
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,680
like what we were talking about before,
it goes through a tube,

1197
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:25,410
like a very tiny miniature cern cern's
like a big magnet holds a particle in a

1198
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:25,980
very specific

1199
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,530
spot at hovers.
It shoots and it hits that.

1200
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:31,050
It decays,
it becomes this matter anti matter

1201
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,370
reaction,
uh,

1202
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:36,420
these generators can convert all that
energy into power and then they can

1203
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,380
amplify that wave that's coming off and
emanating from that element.

1204
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,050
And they amplify it like you would
amplify or a radio wave.

1205
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,190
Now there's no wires in the craft
because most likely it was three d

1206
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:48,900
printed.
We didn't know about three d printing

1207
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:50,850
back then.
I've talked to Bob about this,

1208
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,160
but not just three d,
three d printing,

1209
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,930
you know,
just the materials.

1210
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:58,980
But atomically aligning the elements.
So.

1211
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:04,010
So consciousness and other types of
things can move through those materials

1212
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,100
to operate the craft.
It's really good

1213
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,620
operating it without buttons.
Right.

1214
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,300
Operating it.
So that was theoretically he said

1215
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:13,021
theoretically,
right?

1216
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:15,480
Yeah.
Was that there was handprints and that,

1217
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,210
you know,
they were much different shaped hands

1218
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:23,211
and ours in this craft that he had found
inside one of these bays and area 51,

1219
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:28,230
he realized very quickly that it wasn't
something that we had created and that

1220
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,260
it was somehow another powered through
intention.

1221
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,810
Yep.
That would go through like touch or feel

1222
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:38,310
or or put their hands would be on this
thing and consciously you would somehow

1223
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:40,800
or another control all the various
aspects of this machine.

1224
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,120
Exactly,
exactly.

1225
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,110
Alright.
Sounds good.

1226
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:43,944
Doesn't it?

1227
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,460
I believe so hard.
Well,

1228
00:54:46,461 --> 00:54:50,130
I hope you do because was going to be,
there's going to be a lot of stuff.

1229
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,480
I want to know what you've seen though.
So you've seen this piece of metal.

1230
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:56,750
What else have you seen?
I've seen many,

1231
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:01,751
many documents on the studies of these
things and I've seen a lot of the

1232
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:07,880
science associated with what the
technology is and what it does.

1233
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,450
Like a,
I could show you if I fold up pieces of

1234
00:55:11,451 --> 00:55:13,070
paper and stuff,
what's going on with it,

1235
00:55:13,071 --> 00:55:14,900
but basically,
uh,

1236
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,430
you know,
these craft know when they travel in a

1237
00:55:19,431 --> 00:55:22,730
straight line,
but they're folding space type in event

1238
00:55:22,731 --> 00:55:26,000
horizon where they explain it by folding
a piece of paper and punching a pencil

1239
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:27,050
through it.
You ever see that moment?

1240
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,550
Yeah,
it's kind of like that movie,

1241
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,530
but it's more like,
um,

1242
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,510
you know,
here I can draw it for you here.

1243
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:36,140
Not that this is a,
it's Kinda like when you have two

1244
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:37,790
points,
um,

1245
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,550
you know,
we're used to traveling in a direction

1246
00:55:40,551 --> 00:55:42,590
like that.
And so when we look up,

1247
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,870
we see a plane that goes straight,
right?

1248
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:49,930
But these,
these Ufos fold space time like this,

1249
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,290
uh,
and so it looks like to them they're

1250
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:58,070
going in a straight line.
So if you're in the ship you see that.

1251
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,350
But if you're on the ground you see
that.

1252
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,380
That's why you see them blink off and
on.

1253
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,380
A lot of those videos they're on the,
it looks like they're jumping.

1254
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,510
It's just because of this.
So having space time,

1255
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,140
some way of interfacing with space
itself,

1256
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:15,950
that's very different than our idea of
traveling in a linear way from point a

1257
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:16,700
to point b

1258
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,720
space.
The fabric,

1259
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,840
they call it the fabric of space time
because it's like a fabric.

1260
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:22,280
It's malleable.
Now,

1261
00:56:22,281 --> 00:56:25,270
let me ask you this.
How often into a conversation do people

1262
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:28,240
look at you and think you are fucking
crazy when you started talking about

1263
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:30,100
this and how long was the time?
All the time.

1264
00:56:30,101 --> 00:56:31,480
Right?
But do you ever get to the point where

1265
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:33,490
like,
I don't want to talk about this because

1266
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,190
it's you.
I always tell me,

1267
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:37,960
you don't know what I know and there's a
lot.

1268
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,800
No,
no.

1269
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,210
I mean like,
do you ever get to the point where

1270
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:41,410
you're like,
I can't do this anymore.

1271
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,620
Now people think I'm fucking crazy now
because I'm involved on the most

1272
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:46,780
important shit I've ever been in my
life.

1273
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,060
So I think this is like the most
important thing that you've ever done.

1274
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,390
Fuck yeah.
Like I,

1275
00:56:50,391 --> 00:56:52,750
I have meetings with senators coming up,
like,

1276
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,210
oh fuck yeah,
senator.

1277
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,000
So I can't tell you Dan was all this.
I can't tell you stuff.

1278
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:00,220
I know this is some fucking Trenton.
When is all this going to come out?

1279
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:04,600
Like it seems like this is like a
animate eminent rather disclosure type

1280
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:06,190
shit.
Watch what my company does.

1281
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:07,810
That's what I'll say.
So what is your company?

1282
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:09,130
What are you,
what are you trying to do?

1283
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,350
Well,
we created.

1284
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,350
So if you look at the people involved,
uh,

1285
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,570
we have senior high.
When you get to the senior levels of

1286
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:18,820
government,
you're either called an sts or six

1287
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:20,890
senior intelligence service,
senior executive service,

1288
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,010
or you're a brass.
But either way the civilians have the

1289
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:27,220
same kind of ranking charter that the
breast is.

1290
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:29,380
So scs three,
ss three,

1291
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,540
one three would be the same thing as a
three star general.

1292
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,920
So I,
that's,

1293
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,630
that's who these people are around me.

1294
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,260
So I had the head of the skunkworks
engineering.

1295
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,720
Um,
I got,

1296
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,860
you know,
a to star from the clandestine director,

1297
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,710
head of operations.
I have a guy under secretary of

1298
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,830
intelligence for the Senate Intelligence
Committee and was.

1299
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,120
These guys are retired that croissants.
Retard calls are recorded.

1300
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:52,600
Well,
they all,

1301
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,020
they all left.
They are currently life.

1302
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,520
They now are involved the way you're
doing,

1303
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,640
the way they are current consultants to
the Internet,

1304
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,340
the intelligence community.
Okay.

1305
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,460
That's probably the men involved in this
project with clearance.

1306
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:10,780
They all have their top secret SSC.
I clearances.

1307
00:58:10,781 --> 00:58:12,430
Yeah.
I'm the only one that does it on my

1308
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,230
entire team.
I'm the only one that does it.

1309
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,510
Actually,
Lou that just came out,

1310
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:19,600
I hired him away.
So he was head of all,

1311
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:23,770
uh,
he was in charge of all classified,

1312
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,240
uh,
operations for secretary of Defense

1313
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,210
Mattis.
So he was what's called a gs 15 right

1314
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:32,980
underneath the one,
two and three stars.

1315
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,280
He ran the advanced aerial fet program.
And it's still continuing to this day

1316
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,920
and he's with us now.
So the advanced aerial threat program

1317
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:45,340
under the United States government is
essentially a Ufo.

1318
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:48,880
That's one of the minimization gathering
assessment,

1319
00:58:48,881 --> 00:58:53,881
assessment of all of the,
of what those machines are doing that

1320
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:59,590
gives off all these types of effects
that people are witnessing.

1321
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:04,090
But there's also a very large group of
people that have had within government

1322
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:08,170
that I've had close contact like
hundreds and it's connected to my group

1323
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,090
and there's just more coming in that
way.

1324
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:15,091
So that program is trying to figure out
what those technologies did to those

1325
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:20,971
people and how those technologies work.
Even though it's

1326
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,380
more saddle,
it's more about tasking,

1327
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,230
you know,
our assets like satellites and other

1328
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,360
things to be able to find these things
better.

1329
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,770
But this is different than the secret
machines book,

1330
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:38,480
which is more of another thing also.
Is there communication between the

1331
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,250
United States government and alien
lifeforms?

1332
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,260
I,
I personally,

1333
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,880
I mean,
I don't know any of this stuff,

1334
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,070
uh,
because I'm not invited to those types

1335
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:48,320
of meetings.
But I personally wouldn't doubt it.

1336
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,460
Yeah,
you wouldn't doubt it,

1337
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:52,940
but they've never alluded to it or
discussed it with you in any way.

1338
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,680
Not the,
not this group of people know.

1339
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,380
Is there any speculation as to what
they're doing?

1340
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,560
Resource extraction,
resource extraction,

1341
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:02,600
like are like minerals,
empire building.

1342
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:04,340
I tell people that.
Are the eggs the.

1343
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,890
No,
I think it's changed.

1344
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,470
I think it's Tacos think,
well,

1345
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,880
you know,
they're here for the same reason I am,

1346
01:00:10,881 --> 01:00:12,150
but uh,
um,

1347
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,990
I tell people like a good way to look at
this is like,

1348
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:19,850
look at Syria and Syria is in chaos
because the United States and Russia are

1349
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:21,170
having a proxy war there.

1350
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,960
Now look at the earth.
It's the exact same thing.

1351
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:29,000
Different races are coming here and uh,
and they're trying to win.

1352
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,280
And one the universe we're talking
about.

1353
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,700
I don't know how many,
I don't know,

1354
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,830
but there's a bunch of different
creatures and they all have the same

1355
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:38,780
sort of technology on summer.
Very human.

1356
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:41,090
Some are looked just like you and I
really.

1357
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,020
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1358
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,010
No.
Is there any sort of speculation as to

1359
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:49,880
why life forms from other planets,
other galaxies of the solar systems,

1360
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,430
different kind of gravity,
different environments would create a

1361
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:57,431
life form that's exactly similar to us
or are they imitating what we look like

1362
01:00:57,441 --> 01:01:01,070
in order to infiltrate our world and
hang with us?

1363
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,860
I think probably all knowing.
I think all the above.

1364
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:04,341
I mean,
look,

1365
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:07,840
if you look at,
if you look at Syria or are you just

1366
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,980
going to say it's only Russia and
America,

1367
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:12,170
they're trying is probably there,
Francis probably there,

1368
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:13,320
you know?

1369
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,380
Um,
I,

1370
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:17,570
I personally think the little,
the little aliens with the big black

1371
01:01:17,571 --> 01:01:19,220
eyes,
those are androids,

1372
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:21,710
their biological robots.
They're just programmed.

1373
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,540
There's no different than us cloning
sheep.

1374
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,520
They just clone a being that can travel
through space because space is sort of

1375
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,530
artificial intelligence thing that
doesn't have a life form.

1376
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,690
Right.
I heard that idea before and it Kinda

1377
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,420
kinda makes sense a little bit,
right?

1378
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:36,254
I mean,
if,

1379
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,890
if you're a living thing and you're
traveling through space,

1380
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,210
obviously a biological limitations in
terms of the need for oxygen and

1381
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,470
gravitational interactions and all these
different things that one of the

1382
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:52,190
scariest hallmarks of those ones,
the room or is it in the back of their

1383
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:54,860
head as a transmitter?
So you gotta wonder where it's sending

1384
01:01:54,861 --> 01:01:56,630
shit,
but at the same time,

1385
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,610
you know,
I can tell you that when you look at the

1386
01:01:58,611 --> 01:01:59,970
Bible,
uh,

1387
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,770
the angels and the demons of the Bible
would be the humans and the androids

1388
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:07,670
that I just told you about.
So you think the grades of the Androids,

1389
01:02:07,671 --> 01:02:09,110
right?
So you think there like some sort of

1390
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:10,070
devil?
No,

1391
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,420
I just think that that's how we
characterized it because they come in

1392
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:15,890
and control your thoughts.
Control your body.

1393
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:17,670
Take is in the middle of the night.
Yeah.

1394
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,793
Demons,
you know.

1395
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,153
Um,
so

1396
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,590
do you think these things are traveling
from where?

1397
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,080
Do we have any idea?
There's things that have been put out

1398
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:26,310
there,
but I've never asked.

1399
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:28,320
Why would you not ask them what the
fuck?

1400
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:29,790
He didn't tell me.
Star system like four,

1401
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,451
eight,
three,

1402
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:34,010
and I'll be know about element 1:15.
I would want to know about star ship

1403
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,400
enterprise coordinate 1:15,
nine,

1404
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,810
six,
five polaris.

1405
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,630
Wherever the fuck it is.
Um,

1406
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,750
yeah.
I don't know.

1407
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,130
I don't know.
I do know that there's,

1408
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:47,960
there's connections to um,
you know,

1409
01:02:47,961 --> 01:02:49,440
you won't even fucking believe it.
I'll tell you that.

1410
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:52,240
You want to please Atlantis,
Atlantis,

1411
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,160
the sunken city.
Yeah.

1412
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,340
There's a connection.
There's a connection.

1413
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:00,270
What the connection that there is a very
advanced group that left after a

1414
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:05,271
catastrophe and hung around in a small
outpost here and throughout time would

1415
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,610
push civilization forward and not to the
Greek gods were.

1416
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,040
Whoa.
Yep.

1417
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,800
And that's why it's very interesting
when the Roswell records,

1418
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:16,200
there's Greek writing is there,
there is,

1419
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:18,990
I've never seen any of the records from
Roswell view.

1420
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,800
It's online.
You just type in Roswell records.

1421
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:24,840
You can see it.
We're seen as the dude standing in front

1422
01:03:24,841 --> 01:03:26,650
of the bullshit,
the weather balloon stuff,

1423
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,130
or they'll laugh and yucking it up.
Roswell wreckage,

1424
01:03:29,131 --> 01:03:30,170
Roswell,
IBM,

1425
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,013
you'll see it.
And,

1426
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,930
uh,
and it's got these Greek markings and

1427
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,960
the witnesses that were there did,
um,

1428
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,960
did,
uh,

1429
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:41,180
what do you call it?
A where they go on a site on earth

1430
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:45,160
until,
so that actual IBM showing the word l

1431
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,130
love Fieri,
uh,

1432
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,700
which means freedom in ancient Greek.
So ism from Jamie.

1433
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,690
Let me tell you why he want me to.
I don't know if popped up when it,

1434
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:55,813
when.
Well,

1435
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:56,970
I'm going to tell you something else.

1436
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:02,090
So I went and met.
I'm a former director of CIA and NSA.

1437
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:05,730
He was director of both.
I want to tell you his name and right

1438
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:07,710
when I sat down and told them about my
book,

1439
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,480
pull the picture up again,
literally his little hands.

1440
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:11,070
And right when I sat down and told him
about my,

1441
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:13,050
you gotta this is a big deal.
I wouldn't have everything.

1442
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:18,090
So I'm sitting with this guy.
He was like not that long ago.

1443
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,630
Was Director of CIA and he went on to be
director of NSA.

1444
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:22,770
Okay.
Well,

1445
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:25,110
I think we can find his name maybe,
but uh,

1446
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,060
right when I sat down and told them
about the book,

1447
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:29,010
you know what he says to me,
what he goes,

1448
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:30,720
I didn't read much science fiction as a
kid,

1449
01:04:30,721 --> 01:04:33,750
but I read a lot about Greek mythology
and looked me in the.

1450
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:34,201
I said,
well,

1451
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:36,390
you're going to love the last page of my
book then he's all man.

1452
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,520
And uh,
uh,

1453
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,580
when my book was about ready to go to
pressing,

1454
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,680
I had a very important person call me
up.

1455
01:04:43,681 --> 01:04:46,320
He says,
can you stop that pressing and maybe

1456
01:04:46,321 --> 01:04:48,360
insert something about Greek mythology?
And I said,

1457
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:50,520
I sure can.
So once,

1458
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:53,430
something you got to realize is,
for example,

1459
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,150
the sixth biggest defense contractor in
the world,

1460
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:01,350
at least they used to be six.
There's a company called Science

1461
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:01,620
Applications International Corporation,
let's say.

1462
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:05,340
I see their headquarters are actually in
San Diego and in the front of the

1463
01:05:05,341 --> 01:05:07,330
building you have a,
um,

1464
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,290
an oblique coming out of a fake lake and
two,

1465
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:14,280
um,
Atlantean on thrones and they're both

1466
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:17,190
holding pyramids and one says the past
and the future.

1467
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:18,010
It's in there.

1468
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,190
Eight foot tall statues.
It's fucking nuts by the way.

1469
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,780
An essay.
I see.

1470
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,240
They just,
they went over to Leidos.

1471
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:27,970
Michael Hayden,
the former director of NSA and the CIA.

1472
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:29,440
What about it?
No,

1473
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,210
that's not him,
but I'm not gonna.

1474
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:32,940
I'm not gonna.
Tell you if you try and find out what.

1475
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,590
Can you guys just fishing around?
I'll say a name.

1476
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,590
You Blink.
I'll show you my.

1477
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,650
No Pun intended.
That was cute.

1478
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:42,910
I'll show you my dick.
Like,

1479
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:43,770
no way.
Yeah,

1480
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:44,531
here we go.
If you,

1481
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:47,310
if you are not sure what.
Yeah,

1482
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,490
whatever you get.
I'm going to show you my dick.

1483
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,170
What do you think about all that
Zechariah?

1484
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:55,120
Search and stuff?
I think he was close.

1485
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:57,160
I don't think he was exact,
but it's interpretive.

1486
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:59,110
You know,
if I was to show you some symbols for

1487
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:01,110
people who don't know what that is
exactly what I is,

1488
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:06,130
a is a Palestinian scholar that decoded
a lot of ancient Sumerian texts that

1489
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:07,330
were written in Acadian.

1490
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,010
I'm Samira was like kind of the first
civilization that was advanced that we

1491
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:16,150
even know of just out of nowhere here,
like 3,500 years before Christ.

1492
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:19,000
There's mathematics,
astronomy and all this different shit.

1493
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:21,550
They knew all the planets.
They said there was an extra planet,

1494
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,700
but Zacharias was the.
Was the one that really spent a lot of

1495
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:26,210
time doing that.
And there's,

1496
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:29,680
there's a lot of other scholars that
disagree now he can say,

1497
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,660
you know,
in those texts is the,

1498
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:35,200
is the story of the garden of Eden,
the flood of Noah,

1499
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:39,070
like all that shit.
But his take on it was those who from

1500
01:06:39,071 --> 01:06:41,620
heaven to earth came called the main
jewels,

1501
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:45,220
but they were an advanced race.
They fucked around with genetics.

1502
01:06:45,221 --> 01:06:49,350
Well that was the,
his take on the definition of Nephilim

1503
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,880
was the.
Was the nephew.

1504
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:51,714
Yeah.
What you find them.

1505
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,620
You find that in genesis,
the Nephilim.

1506
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,310
So,
you know,

1507
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,060
he,
he was able to tell a really interesting

1508
01:06:58,061 --> 01:07:02,860
story based on these texts and um,
but some people don't agree with them,

1509
01:07:02,861 --> 01:07:04,240
but at the,
at the end of the day,

1510
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:07,660
I think it's the closest thing we got.
And in my early conversations when I

1511
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:10,330
was,
when I was being given some interesting

1512
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:13,150
science fiction stuff for my book,
uh,

1513
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:17,640
the Greek mythology part,
I brought up the Sumerians and they

1514
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,680
showed me one particular king.
They said this,

1515
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:23,410
we find this one very interesting and I
can't remember his name,

1516
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:25,780
but it fired so quick when I asked the
question.

1517
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,030
It came right back with this whole thing
on this one,

1518
01:07:28,031 --> 01:07:30,040
Sumerian king.
Really interesting.

1519
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,530
Well,
what's fascinating about them is that

1520
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:35,020
they really did know a lot about our
solar system.

1521
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:38,170
Can you think about the fact that they
were around 5,000 years ago,

1522
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:42,460
they had a detailed model of the solar
system with all of the planets and they

1523
01:07:42,461 --> 01:07:44,650
were all relatively close in size.

1524
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,680
This is a clay,
one of those clay cylinders that you

1525
01:07:47,681 --> 01:07:50,360
would.
What you would do is you would put out a

1526
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:54,400
flat piece of clay and you would roll
this cylinder over it and that's how

1527
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:55,780
they would print things.
Yep.

1528
01:07:56,020 --> 01:08:01,020
And this and this really sort of kind of
primitive way of doing this.

1529
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,090
Somehow or another,
they knew a lot about astronomy.

1530
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,430
I mean,
they knew about the structure of our

1531
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:08,320
solar system.
They knew where the planets were,

1532
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:08,951
right?
Well,

1533
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:13,951
you gotta remember Galileo was almost
killed and confined to his house house

1534
01:08:13,961 --> 01:08:16,160
arrest because he said that the

1535
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,880
universe doesn't revolve around us.
We revolve around the sun and that was

1536
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:23,210
way after.
That's for 5,000 years after the

1537
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:25,550
seminarians that already knew that,
you know,

1538
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,160
we weren't the center of the universe.
So it's interesting.

1539
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:31,430
We were really smart and then we went
backwards.

1540
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,980
You know,
and there's probably a bit more to that

1541
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:36,140
story too,
that hopefully one day we'll get into

1542
01:08:36,141 --> 01:08:36,891
it.
Well,

1543
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:39,350
it's just,
it's really interesting when you look at

1544
01:08:39,351 --> 01:08:43,490
these ancient civilizations and their
attempts to decipher the world around

1545
01:08:43,491 --> 01:08:46,100
them and you try to figure out what did
they know?

1546
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,680
You know,
how much did they know that the

1547
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,350
Sumerians or one of the more interesting
cases to me,

1548
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:55,700
because of the fact that they had this
really bizarre map of the solar system

1549
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,890
when we didn't,
they,

1550
01:08:57,891 --> 01:09:00,680
they found out about Pluto.
They had a,

1551
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,850
an image of Pluto and I don't think we
found out about Pluto until like the

1552
01:09:04,851 --> 01:09:06,080
early 19 hundreds.

1553
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,620
Yeah.
The Pluto might've even been like 15 or

1554
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:10,940
16.
You can find that out.

1555
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:14,780
Pluto was found like,
like not even that long ago.

1556
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:17,300
I don't know if it was as far back as
the night to see if you could find that

1557
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:21,050
out and then find the image of the
Annunaki when they show the solar

1558
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:23,300
system.
Because the image is really fascinating

1559
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,040
because it is what it is.
I mean,

1560
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:26,650
you look at it,
there's a son.

1561
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,380
I mean it's clearly a son.
It has like a,

1562
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:33,050
it's a large circle.
It's in the sky and it has those little

1563
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:36,060
son sort of raise around this picture,
right?

1564
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:38,180
Because yeah.
That's the picture.

1565
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,940
There you go.
So do you know they,

1566
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:43,220
they have an idea of where to look for
this extra planet.

1567
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,760
They thought in the early nineties,
jpl announced that they thought they

1568
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:48,380
found a companion to our son.

1569
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,750
He'll look at that.
I mean that's fucking radical right

1570
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:51,380
there.
Yeah,

1571
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,630
it's crazy.
They have pluto in there now.

1572
01:09:53,631 --> 01:09:57,710
Go to the discovery of Pluto when we
went to Pluto,

1573
01:09:57,711 --> 01:09:58,760
get discovered.
I think you're right.

1574
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:01,420
I think it wasn't the 19 fifties.
I know it was sometime in the 19th.

1575
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,890
I'm talking about Disney's Pluto,
which means 30,

1576
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:05,510
19,
30.

1577
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:06,980
Crazy.
Crazy shit.

1578
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,470
Yeah.
So these people somehow or another new

1579
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:14,471
about Pluto fuck in way before us.
And this is not something you could see

1580
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:17,950
with the naked eye.
So somehow or another and ignore where

1581
01:10:17,951 --> 01:10:19,910
there's other planets.
I mean you could see a few of them.

1582
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,250
You could see Mars and sometimes you
could see Jupiter,

1583
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:23,960
maybe Saturn,
right?

1584
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:28,120
Saturn.
What are the ones you can see Saturn and

1585
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,010
after that they had uranus.
You can't see.

1586
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,950
It's just the other one.
Time have,

1587
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,860
I don't know,
every 25 years you can barely see it

1588
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:39,320
with the naked eye we were in last week
or something like that.

1589
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,370
You were at Griffith Observatory.
It was like super crowded because of

1590
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:44,670
that.
Or we're not gonna we're not gonna.

1591
01:10:44,671 --> 01:10:46,100
Make jokes and shit about your anus,
right?

1592
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:47,430
No,
because it's so old.

1593
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,420
Yeah.
And were they looking at it with the

1594
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:55,070
naked eye or with telescope?
I feel like you could observed because

1595
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,170
everyone goes there.
There's a bunch of telescopes already

1596
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,180
set up,
but that makes sense for telescopes.

1597
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:02,430
But why would the naked eye.
It's one of the best places closest to

1598
01:11:02,431 --> 01:11:05,250
la or I don't.
Yeah,

1599
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:08,030
La is weird because of the light
pollution right now.

1600
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,790
It's so it's a big deal.
That's why,

1601
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,170
you know when you go to the desert and
it's beautiful and I'm like Whoa,

1602
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:13,770
that's you releasing.
It was last week,

1603
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,190
October

1604
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,680
19th.
You could see with your naked eye that

1605
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,730
urine,
the secret to a unit.

1606
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,630
You guys are talking about naked in
Uranus.

1607
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,610
A lot here and I don't want to make any
jokes.

1608
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:21,780
I'm not,
but I'm just telling you what you're

1609
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:24,300
talking about.
See your anus with your naked eye this

1610
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,380
week.
Giggle if you must.

1611
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:29,420
What a goofy name too.
Like what?

1612
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,760
All the different sounds you can make
with your face and they chose your

1613
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,830
buddle.
What if they just call it buddle?

1614
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,360
Yeah.
Butthole planet butthole.

1615
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,600
It'd be just as weird.
Fucking crazy.

1616
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:42,340
Fast be the first place I go.
That would be the first place you've

1617
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:43,590
visited the planet buddle?
Yeah.

1618
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:46,290
Do you think that there's life in our
solar system?

1619
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,940
I do.
Where do you think it is?

1620
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:49,560
Europa?
Really?

1621
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,560
So you think there's some sort of a
primitive life form that's under the

1622
01:11:52,561 --> 01:11:52,890
ice?

1623
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:56,670
I think there's life on Mars and I think
it's a little start from.

1624
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,090
I think there's life on Mars.
I think it's small little animals in

1625
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:04,350
microbial or or insects shit that's kind
of learning how to live with it's

1626
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,530
radioactive environment,
which by the way,

1627
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:12,620
a bunch of scientists from jpl found
that there was some atomic weapons that

1628
01:12:14,011 --> 01:12:16,820
went off on Mars because the,
the,

1629
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,880
the radioactive signature is can only
happen if you explode a nuclear weapon.

1630
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:24,450
That's artificially made,
not like a,

1631
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,900
like something that happens naturally,
like a moon exploding on the surface.

1632
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,080
So it's interesting.
So you read that.

1633
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,270
Oh Shit.
That's been all over the place.

1634
01:12:33,271 --> 01:12:34,890
I forgot the guy's name.
The doctor's name.

1635
01:12:34,891 --> 01:12:36,150
Um,
he's a,

1636
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:39,960
he actually was one of the lead
scientists on a clementine mission which

1637
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:42,120
was mapping the moon with jpl.
So he's a,

1638
01:12:42,121 --> 01:12:42,954
he's a big time dude.

1639
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:47,050
And he thinks there was nuclear war.
Huge.

1640
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,090
Well,
he doesn't say that.

1641
01:12:48,091 --> 01:12:52,890
He just says that nuclear weapons.
He just says we have this signature.

1642
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,920
He all peer reviewed science that the
signature of the radioactive activity

1643
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:03,510
from this very specific isotope that
only comes from artificial nuclear

1644
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:05,130
explosion or something.
Shit,

1645
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:06,780
I don't want to mess with something
along those lines.

1646
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,030
Well,
I'd heard before that they thought that

1647
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:12,810
somehow or another Mars was impacted
that something hit it like some sort of

1648
01:13:12,811 --> 01:13:15,090
Rasta oil impact and it destroyed the
environment.

1649
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:17,940
I think it's the new,
if you type in nuclear weapon Mars or

1650
01:13:17,941 --> 01:13:20,190
nukes on Mars or some shit,
you'll find it.

1651
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,470
You go to Richard Hoagland site,
Hoagland.

1652
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,050
He kind of disappeared though.
Yeah.

1653
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,290
That guy was wacky as fuck,
like he,

1654
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,740
he was one of the WHO's the one of the
main proponents of the face on Mars and

1655
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,630
all the pyramids that they found on
Mars.

1656
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:37,830
They would find these weird connections
chain one point to another point and

1657
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:40,710
somehow or another they made some
arbitrary distinctions that those were

1658
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:45,270
indicative of intelligent design.
Elon musk wanted to drop nukes up there

1659
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:46,380
too.
Good move.

1660
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,150
Elan Musk elaborates proposal to nuke.
Maurice,

1661
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:52,150
how's that?
Picture is not.

1662
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,570
He's probably bored.
He put on his instagram last night.

1663
01:13:54,571 --> 01:13:57,540
He was a cooking hot dogs and
marshmallows and singing along with

1664
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:00,540
Johnny cash drinking whiskey.
That's what he should be fucking

1665
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,750
scientist.
Yeah.

1666
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,500
That's Elon Musk for president.
I'll vote for you buddy.

1667
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:06,090
Come on.
Let's do it.

1668
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,910
Why don't you talk to him and he's
already got space x once you guys

1669
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,830
collaborated.
The second thing we're doing,

1670
01:14:10,831 --> 01:14:12,280
he might really actually be interested

1671
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,380
in.
And so the two aerospace projects to the

1672
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:17,680
stars is doing.
One is we're building something that

1673
01:14:17,681 --> 01:14:20,440
will in effect be anti gravity,
but it's actually,

1674
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:22,180
that's actually not the mechanism it
does.

1675
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,890
Uh,
and building a spacecraft,

1676
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:26,260
but the second thing that we're doing is
called beamed energy propulsion,

1677
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,630
which is something I think musk will be
very interested in.

1678
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,570
It's launching cubesats with lasers.
So,

1679
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:33,880
uh,
the air force research lab kind of broke

1680
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:38,530
the science back in the nineties and a
bunch of people associated with that

1681
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:42,910
program got it declassified and they're
working for us on building it.

1682
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:47,410
So it'll take a handful of years to do.
But what you do is you use very strong,

1683
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:52,000
either microwaves or some other kind of
wave and it ignites and explodes the air

1684
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:54,400
underneath a mechanism that carries a
cube set.

1685
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,880
And so essentially what happens is,
is you don't use any fossil fuels and it

1686
01:14:59,921 --> 01:15:03,430
can bring the cost of launching a cube
sat from like 50 grand down to five

1687
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:04,570
grand.
It's like crazy.

1688
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:09,571
So that means colleges and neighbors and
anyone else can launch cube sats quite

1689
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:10,590
easily.

1690
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,390
Now,
have you had any debates with people

1691
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:13,720
about this stuff?
If you ever like,

1692
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:17,130
had someone who thinks that this is all
nonsense and sat down with you,

1693
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:22,140
understands physics and understands
rocket propulsion space and elements.

1694
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:23,750
And all that shit.

1695
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,380
Um,
no I haven't.

1696
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,060
I wouldn't be able to debate a
physicist,

1697
01:15:27,061 --> 01:15:28,470
but they can read all the papers.

1698
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:29,801
Right.
But I mean,

1699
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:31,430
is anybody been skeptical?
Zara.

1700
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,760
But yeah,
everyone's skeptical.

1701
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:34,890
Yeah.
And what's your response to that?

1702
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,960
You don't know what I know,
right?

1703
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:38,100
Well,
do you know though?

1704
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:40,650
I don't know.
I can't tell you some of the shit that I

1705
01:15:40,651 --> 01:15:44,280
know and I can't tell you,
but what could it be that so crazy if

1706
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:45,150
you,
you'd know.

1707
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:46,230
I mean,
what you've said,

1708
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:50,010
we'll think about what you've said.
You said that there's some ridiculous

1709
01:15:50,011 --> 01:15:55,011
sorta propulsion system that allows you
to move through time that they,

1710
01:15:55,110 --> 01:16:00,110
they visit this planet all the time and
extract resources that there's people in

1711
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:04,110
the government that are trying to
disseminate this information,

1712
01:16:04,111 --> 01:16:06,330
but they don't know how to do it.
They don't have the right vehicle to do

1713
01:16:06,331 --> 01:16:08,130
it.
They're doing it in these sort of

1714
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:11,220
controlled chunks.
Think of all these things that you've

1715
01:16:11,221 --> 01:16:12,750
said.
What could possibly be crazier than

1716
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:14,190
that?
Well,

1717
01:16:14,191 --> 01:16:16,220
you're asking me how do I know and.
No,

1718
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:16,500
no,
no,

1719
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,281
no.
I'm asking you,

1720
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:20,130
what do you know that could possibly be
crazier than that?

1721
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,290
Well,
like that's the Shit I can't tell you.

1722
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,600
It's not.
Everything's Hunky Dory.

1723
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,360
Is it something where you worried about
the fate of the human race?

1724
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,700
I think that's part of it.
Where should I move?

1725
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:31,810
I was going to move.
It's not existential.

1726
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:33,300
If your dick out.
If I should go to Australia.

1727
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,250
How about,
how about I just get down in Australia.

1728
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:42,790
I mean where's the spot?
I don't think there is one

1729
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,230
unfortunately.
Spot they just get this.

1730
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,380
This is what I will say.
They're not existential in the sense of

1731
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,140
they're not gonna come here like
independence day in nuke the place.

1732
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,800
Um,
but it,

1733
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:52,760
there,
you know,

1734
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:55,750
there are things to worry about and
that's why I think

1735
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:58,130
anybody that's famous,
that's an alien.

1736
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,020
Oh,
I don't know.

1737
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:03,620
Do you think there's any influential
figure that has been sort of shaping

1738
01:17:03,621 --> 01:17:06,560
culture that might not be one of us?
Oprah,

1739
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,810
for sure.
It has to be Oprah.

1740
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,370
Yeah.
If you go back to the early days

1741
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,780
when Oprah says,
do that stupid show,

1742
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:15,590
we should have like KKK members on and
everybody sat on white plastic seats.

1743
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:18,140
Remember those days or that Geraldo?
Is that Oprah,

1744
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:19,310
Oprah,
or early days?

1745
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:20,600
Man,
me and Al Magical.

1746
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:24,070
I'll never forget this.
It was like when I first met owl,

1747
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:29,150
probably like late nineties,
I think we were in San Francisco doing

1748
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:33,830
bong hits,
watching TV and oprah was on and it was

1749
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:36,210
old oprah,
Oprah,

1750
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:40,290
oprah might not have been the nineties,
might have been early 2000 of aliens

1751
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:42,120
from men in black.
They were watching at the beginning,

1752
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:43,020
remember?
Oh yeah.

1753
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:44,931
You know,
I don't know.

1754
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:45,920
I mean I,
uh,

1755
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,620
again,
there's elements of this subject that

1756
01:17:48,621 --> 01:17:50,920
are,
that are disturbing and you know,

1757
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:52,550
I don't think people need to know all
that shit.

1758
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:56,690
So do you subscribe to the idea that
human beings are the product of genetic

1759
01:17:56,691 --> 01:17:57,920
engineering?
I do.

1760
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,990
You do?
So you think that they took some lower

1761
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:04,250
hominids and that they did something to
them to create human beings?

1762
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,280
That is a very popular theory among Ufo
fanatics.

1763
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:10,010
Or she'll say fans,
[inaudible] I,

1764
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,380
I don't want to speak again for my
company,

1765
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:15,830
but one of the people on our board,
a scientific,

1766
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,990
they call it a scientific advisory
board,

1767
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:23,120
is a lead geneticists from Stanford who
I think he was up for the Nobel this

1768
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,781
year.
And what's his name?

1769
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:26,210
Dr Gary Nolan.
And he will be the Jeanette.

1770
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:29,300
He would be the guy to ask about that at
him in here.

1771
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,290
But he,
but he's,

1772
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,630
he's only going to tell you what's,
what,

1773
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,140
what he can prove with science.
He's not going to speculate,

1774
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:36,140
you know?
So what,

1775
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,560
what makes people think that?
Like what's the science that makes

1776
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:40,450
people think that?
Well,

1777
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,780
there's a lot of junk DNA.

1778
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,630
There's certain parts of our DNA that
seems to have been turned off.

1779
01:18:44,631 --> 01:18:46,260
There's,
there's a,

1780
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:51,530
a bunch of things in there that we don't
understand and we don't have the leaps

1781
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:57,040
of humanity over the past 5,000 years to
really show like where did,

1782
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:01,730
what happened in the past 5,000 years
that wasn't happening for the hundreds

1783
01:19:01,731 --> 01:19:05,570
of millions of years before that.
They just found a footprint that was,

1784
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:07,760
um,
like 100 million years old or something

1785
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:09,320
like that.
That was just a human footprint.

1786
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,570
What they did,
I just read the news,

1787
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,130
I don't know.
I can't remember,

1788
01:19:13,131 --> 01:19:14,780
but it's like a fossil and now they're
like,

1789
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:17,240
fuck,
this totally throws everything upside

1790
01:19:17,241 --> 01:19:18,440
down.
And talking to Sarah Pailin,

1791
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,030
there was something to sell a pale and
said,

1792
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,420
remember that like there was a librarian
that said that she,

1793
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:23,960
she didn't believe that,
uh,

1794
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,260
she was a young Earth creationist and
she thought that,

1795
01:19:27,261 --> 01:19:29,510
uh,
there was a picture online that showed a

1796
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:32,750
human footprint inside of dinosaur
footprint that approved the people

1797
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:33,680
walked dinosaurs.

1798
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,910
I wouldn't doubt it.
I doubt that people walked with diamond.

1799
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:37,551
Oh,
not at all.

1800
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:41,540
I think there's been cycles of
civilizations and I think the people on

1801
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:44,360
the inside know that.
And that's why at that defense

1802
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:45,890
contractor,
multi,

1803
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:46,491
multi,
multi,

1804
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:49,520
multibillion dollar defense,
the ones that chose the government of

1805
01:19:49,521 --> 01:19:53,330
Iraq after we took over Iraq and the
ones that looked over after all of our

1806
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:54,040
nukes,
hey,

1807
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,090
look it there.
They have print inside of dinosaur

1808
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:56,930
footprints.
She's right.

1809
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,170
But they have,
um,

1810
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,330
but they have at that place,
remember I told you they have the past

1811
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:04,460
and the future with big pyramids in
their hands,

1812
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:05,360
which regions,
you know,

1813
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:06,350
that they're trying.
It's like,

1814
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:08,520
it's a spooky

1815
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:12,000
when you look at that and you believe
that the asteroid hit the Yucatan and

1816
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:15,030
caused the mass extinction that killed
off most of the life on the planet.

1817
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,630
I don't know.
I can't believe in it.

1818
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,341
I don't know.
Fuck,

1819
01:20:17,341 --> 01:20:19,200
I've never studied that shit and I
wasn't there.

1820
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,210
But I mean there's physical evidence for
that.

1821
01:20:21,211 --> 01:20:22,170
It's more like,
well,

1822
01:20:22,171 --> 01:20:23,640
yeah,
but I haven't read anything about it.

1823
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:26,310
But sure.
I can believe in things.

1824
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:27,710
I can't prove a lot of things,
you know?

1825
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,460
Right.
But that's like the whole reason why

1826
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:34,250
we're supposedly here that it killed off
the dinosaurs and allowed whatever they

1827
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:38,700
think there was some sort of a mole,
mole type creature that evolved over 65

1828
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,040
million years ago was bullshit.
I think it's all bullshit.

1829
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:43,050
I think you think evolution bullshit?
Um,

1830
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:45,750
no.
I think that at some point in history,

1831
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,010
uh,
they came.

1832
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,820
Someone came here and tampered with
existing creatures and made us an

1833
01:20:50,821 --> 01:20:54,750
upgraded us at very specific intervals
who tampered with them and what came

1834
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:55,740
first,
the chicken or the egg.

1835
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,540
You know what I'm saying?
Question.

1836
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,373
Yeah.
I don't know.

1837
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:01,200
A single celled organism.
We all kind of agree like that was like

1838
01:21:01,201 --> 01:21:02,160
the beginning,
right?

1839
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,110
Most scientists,
not we,

1840
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,920
I'm too stupid for this,
but obviously somehow or another that

1841
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:09,180
became a bird,
right?

1842
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,600
Why couldn't it become a monkey?
Why could that monkey become a person?

1843
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,291
I think it,
yeah.

1844
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:15,990
I don't know.
I mean look at evolution changes.

1845
01:21:15,991 --> 01:21:19,050
I mean we can,
we know that people that like beat their

1846
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:21,960
kids,
their kids DNA changes based on getting

1847
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:22,794
beat,
you know?

1848
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,860
So when you were fighting,
you were changing people's DNA and

1849
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:27,520
you're a geneticist,
you know,

1850
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:30,390
you went after it for science,
you know,

1851
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,550
that's why we were doing the fighting
for sure.

1852
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,370
It's a lab coat on.
So if you,

1853
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:39,810
if you think about it that way,
if you think about that all life somehow

1854
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:43,610
or another continues to evolve and
advanced and through natural selection,

1855
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:48,620
genetic mutation and random mutations
that things move from one stage of

1856
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:51,930
existence to what they are today.
Right?

1857
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:53,940
That when you look at,
you know,

1858
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:58,500
a con or a hippopotamus that it used to
be something different and now it's

1859
01:21:58,501 --> 01:21:59,130
that.
Sure,

1860
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:00,870
why wouldn't that be the case that
people too.

1861
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,250
I think that is the case with people.
I just think that the quantum leaps in

1862
01:22:05,251 --> 01:22:10,251
our evolution,
our symptoms or effects of being

1863
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:13,590
genetically upgraded.
The way I've heard it explained to me

1864
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:14,424
though,
is that those,

1865
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:18,030
the only leap that's really confusing is
the doubling of the human brain.

1866
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,840
You got a big leap and so over the
period of 2 million years apparently,

1867
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,150
obviously I'm too stupid to really
understand this,

1868
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:26,340
but from what I've read,
what I've heard people talk about,

1869
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,100
that's apparently one of the biggest
misses mysteries,

1870
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:32,040
uh,
when it comes to the human fossil

1871
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:35,010
record.
But there's a pretty clear line

1872
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,340
apparently from Australia,
[inaudible] to,

1873
01:22:37,341 --> 01:22:39,660
you know,
to the homeless Judaism zig words on me.

1874
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:42,030
Trying to pivot is not a big word like
it.

1875
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:45,180
What the fuck is that stuff again?
Penis,

1876
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,890
anus,
whatever.

1877
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,030
That's called.
One 15,

1878
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,730
1:15.
That's death on that stuff.

1879
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:55,560
So what is your company aiming to do and
when are you trying to do it?

1880
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,320
So the next steps.
So to the Stars Academy of Arts and

1881
01:22:58,321 --> 01:23:01,110
Science wise we have an academy because
people.

1882
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:01,850
Yeah,
there's,

1883
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,450
there's teaching,
there's science,

1884
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,980
there's art major know there's film

1885
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,950
franchises.
So what this doesn't say musicals,

1886
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,823
know musicals,
right?

1887
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:12,820
It's only musicals.
Musicals.

1888
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,060
It's like everything is cool but not
really stupid art forum.

1889
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,220
It's a,
it's a musical,

1890
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:20,350
but it's very salacious.
Very,

1891
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:22,560
very sexual musicals.
But okay.

1892
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:26,620
So what we did essentially is you have a
senior engineer,

1893
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:31,630
chief engineer from the classified
aerospace world building shit.

1894
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:35,740
And then you have a guy like me that's
putting out some stories and making some

1895
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:39,430
movies about some things.
And then you have my physicists.

1896
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:40,900
Can I stop you there?
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1897
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:44,950
but why stories and why fiction,
like why not just going to be both.

1898
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:46,450
There's maybe both,
but why fiction?

1899
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:51,480
Why not just concentrate entirely on
revealing the truth because it has to be

1900
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:55,300
managed in a certain way for people to
understand and I think that someone's

1901
01:23:55,301 --> 01:23:59,560
sitting down and watching a debate play
out and having an idea of what,

1902
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,110
what went on over the past 70 years.

1903
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:05,410
They'll come out of that with an
emotional response and more of an

1904
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:08,590
understanding and then want to go watch
the documentary and then want to buy

1905
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:10,600
some of the nonfiction works that we've
done.

1906
01:24:10,601 --> 01:24:11,650
I've already put out,
um,

1907
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,570
uh,
one of our nonfiction books with secret

1908
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:15,370
machines.
Now the,

1909
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:16,330
uh,
that movie.

1910
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,440
What is it?
Arrival.

1911
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,550
Yeah.
I was at the movie where there's like

1912
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,600
sort of weird time shit in that movie.
Does that movie have any basis in

1913
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:26,820
reality?
No.

1914
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:28,750
Secret people behind the scenes?
No,

1915
01:24:28,751 --> 01:24:29,590
I don't think so.
But,

1916
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:31,240
uh,
there's nothing in there that's familiar

1917
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:36,160
to me other than the fact that the dream
sequences and the time stuff and her

1918
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,670
having flashes of that shit's absolutely
on par.

1919
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:40,863
And,
um,

1920
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:44,720
the idea of having a,
an international group work together and

1921
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:47,980
figure something out that's absolutely
on what's happening right now.

1922
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,630
And everybody's keeping their mouth
shut.

1923
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:51,550
Oh fuck you.
Why are they doing that?

1924
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:53,500
Why aren't people spilling the beans?
Um,

1925
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,513
well,
it's not every.

1926
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:56,080
I mean,
look at Lou Elizondo,

1927
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:58,150
the guy that works for me,
they just came from the Pentagon,

1928
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,070
literally quit the Pentagon two weeks
ago.

1929
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,040
I was the,
I can't tell you where I'm at,

1930
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,080
but I know I'm sorry.
But,

1931
01:25:05,081 --> 01:25:05,871
um,
but,

1932
01:25:05,871 --> 01:25:07,350
uh,
he's with me and he,

1933
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:12,160
he was onstage with me on the live event
we did on the 11 saying I left the

1934
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:17,161
Pentagon days ago.
I ran this particular Ufo program and

1935
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:20,770
this is what we know and they are real
and we're gonna continue that program

1936
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:23,880
here at to the stars.
Now what's your.

1937
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:27,250
So your goal is to release this
information through documentaries,

1938
01:25:27,251 --> 01:25:29,290
through films,
and educate people,

1939
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:32,290
but the existence of this and is it to
make a ship?

1940
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:33,191
What?
No.

1941
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:35,350
So we're bringing.
So this is once again,

1942
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:37,300
look there by putting together.

1943
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:42,130
You can't attack this subject by just
like if you make a movie that's a crazy

1944
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:44,230
movie.
If you make a science paper on it and

1945
01:25:44,231 --> 01:25:48,040
then no one's going to read it and the
technology will never see the light of

1946
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:53,041
day because it's been modified as
weaponry or whatever it is that the only

1947
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:58,351
way to get people to understand what the
fuck is going on is by first present

1948
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:03,010
them the story so they have an
understanding that it is real and it

1949
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:08,120
happening and laid in a way that's
grounded and practical and uh,

1950
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:12,590
but still moves you and then follow up
with the science and then show them that

1951
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:16,850
that thing you're watching in the movie
can be engineered and created.

1952
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,820
So we're doing it all together.
But there's a thing called a community

1953
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:23,480
of interest.
So to the stars is also building a

1954
01:26:23,481 --> 01:26:27,920
portal with the Department of Defense to
share information,

1955
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:31,400
to educate people,
to put some declassified now

1956
01:26:31,401 --> 01:26:34,280
declassified videos of Ufo shows,
some science,

1957
01:26:34,281 --> 01:26:36,050
some documents,
and have open forums,

1958
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,930
uh,
and have current military people talk to

1959
01:26:38,931 --> 01:26:39,764
young adults.

1960
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:43,900
So you're gonna expose people to this
narrative and uh,

1961
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:48,940
explained to them through stories what
this could be that sets the stage.

1962
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:53,860
Then you start to introduce the actual
real elements that actually exist yet.

1963
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:58,280
And then eventually what,
what's the end game will the end game is

1964
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:00,650
to.
The technology itself is like.

1965
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,680
So when,
when you make a,

1966
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,640
when you,
when you create this energy source to

1967
01:27:05,641 --> 01:27:08,180
power the spacecraft,
it's called an over unity machine.

1968
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:11,270
So it puts out more power than what's
put into it.

1969
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:16,510
You can desalinate ocean water with it,
you can get rid of a atomic power.

1970
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:18,710
So there's no radio,
no more Fukushima xeno.

1971
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:22,310
It could do a lot of different things,
but it also will rapidly,

1972
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:26,600
rapidly transform our entire
transportation and communication

1973
01:27:26,601 --> 01:27:30,220
network.
So the end result with that is it,

1974
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:35,240
that'll get spun out into a accompany.
That's probably partners with major

1975
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:40,790
aerospace organizations,
which with whom I'm already talking and

1976
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:41,890
we partner on the madness.

1977
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:43,130
You can't tell me who they are,
no,

1978
01:27:43,131 --> 01:27:46,520
fuck now I can't tell you and we bring
that out to the world,

1979
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:50,630
but the only way that can be brought out
to the world as if the public owns it

1980
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:53,810
and we build it from scratch.
The public was the public have to own it

1981
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,820
because,
well I guess you could be in a way a

1982
01:27:55,821 --> 01:27:57,980
private person,
but the technology,

1983
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:01,490
it probably has an element of what they
call eminent domain.

1984
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:05,300
So we're going to get to a certain point
where certain agencies will probably

1985
01:28:05,301 --> 01:28:07,370
knock on our door and go,
what the fuck are you doing?

1986
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:10,070
And we're going to say the public owns
this.

1987
01:28:10,071 --> 01:28:11,630
You can't take it from.
And they're gonna say fuck yeah,

1988
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:13,400
we can take it and we're going to say
we're going to work something out

1989
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,280
because it's like building a nuclear
bomb in your basement kind of thing.

1990
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,040
So,
so when you say the public owns it,

1991
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:20,810
like how will that be possible?
How would the,

1992
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:23,810
how will the public own it?
The you can go to our,

1993
01:28:23,811 --> 01:28:26,840
we've,
we reserved a small amount of shares of

1994
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:29,330
the company that people can buy stock in
the company right now.

1995
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,480
So a year ago,
the success,

1996
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,110
not the public.
That's private,

1997
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,640
that's private ownership,
right?

1998
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:37,650
If people buy the company can go public,
but no it didn't.

1999
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:38,420
No,
it is public.

2000
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:41,300
So a year and a half ago,
maybe 24 months ago,

2001
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,900
the sec wanted to democratize,
um,

2002
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:47,690
uh,
going public with companies just like an

2003
01:28:47,691 --> 01:28:50,060
IPO but not have to spend millions of
dollars and do it.

2004
01:28:50,061 --> 01:28:51,770
So they launched what's called a
regulation,

2005
01:28:51,771 --> 01:28:55,820
a direct public offering.
And we had a file with the SEC.

2006
01:28:55,821 --> 01:28:59,180
So we had to spend hundreds of thousands
of dollars to do this and we spent the

2007
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:01,980
last six months doing it and our live
event

2008
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,660
launch that.
So you can go to tennis.

2009
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:08,740
Did this just so that you can tell the
whoever the fuck it is that will come

2010
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:09,990
after you,
that hey,

2011
01:29:09,991 --> 01:29:11,760
the public owns this.
You can't take that.

2012
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:14,610
That's one element of everything that
we're doing.

2013
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,650
Yeah.
That.

2014
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:19,080
So you're anticipate you're spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars to

2015
01:29:19,081 --> 01:29:23,040
anticipate someone coming in and closing
the doors and they yet you're talking

2016
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:25,250
about it in advance.
We're like,

2017
01:29:25,251 --> 01:29:28,200
you're essentially telling,
strategizing that you know,

2018
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:29,730
but you're letting them know that you
know,

2019
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,190
that they're going to come and get it.
It'd be much harder to shut it down when

2020
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:34,470
the whole world has paid for it,
invested in it,

2021
01:29:34,471 --> 01:29:35,930
owns it.
And uh,

2022
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,220
so he trying to get people to buy
things.

2023
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,050
I'm trying.
What do you mean you tried to get people

2024
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:41,790
to buy stock?
Well,

2025
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:42,960
yeah.
Right now we're a public.

2026
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,610
You can buy shares of the company.
You can only.

2027
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:47,730
We only put up.
I'm a very limited amount that we only

2028
01:29:47,731 --> 01:29:50,010
put it.
I think we only put up $5 million shares

2029
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:51,840
or so.
That seems like a lot of shares.

2030
01:29:51,841 --> 01:29:55,330
How many shares are they're all others.
Oh Lord is like a 100 million probably

2031
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,520
or something like 100.
How does that,

2032
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,190
how does shares work?
Shares late.

2033
01:29:58,230 --> 01:29:59,670
You just don't work.
Like say if we,

2034
01:29:59,671 --> 01:30:02,040
uh,
came up with young Jamie incorporated.

2035
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:03,960
Yeah.
And we wanted to start selling shares.

2036
01:30:03,961 --> 01:30:08,040
When you file as a corporation,
you can issue shares and you can sell

2037
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:12,240
those shares to people in those shares.
Have a price based on,

2038
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:13,890
you know,
how you want to value your company,

2039
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:14,700
you know.
Okay.

2040
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,700
So you could have like 100 million
shares of young Jamie Incorporated.

2041
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:18,900
Yep.
You sure can.

2042
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:21,210
Okay.
And so then the government can shut you

2043
01:30:21,211 --> 01:30:21,810
down,
Bro.

2044
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:24,480
Nah.
Well you guys may be because you say a

2045
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:25,460
lot of bad words.
No,

2046
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:25,831
no,
no.

2047
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:27,660
Jamie doesn't.
But I'm warming.

2048
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,430
We do a lot at the company.
Right?

2049
01:30:29,431 --> 01:30:33,210
So we're building essentially a science
fiction version of Disney.

2050
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,220
Okay.
So we have four film franchises.

2051
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,540
Not all of them,
about Ufos.

2052
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,700
One is kind of this blade runner night,
all about nightmares kind of thing.

2053
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:44,940
One is like an old amblin.
Spielberg goes and making these things

2054
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:45,850
a.
We are.

2055
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:48,210
Let me know who's writing them.
I wrote the first one.

2056
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:52,990
I'm directing that a good directing too.
I wrote this script and you're multi

2057
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,840
talented motherfucker.
Look I'm,

2058
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,910
that's where I'm going with most of this
stuff.

2059
01:30:56,911 --> 01:31:00,000
But the company I had to get up and get
going and set it up and we bring in a

2060
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:02,850
ceo and all that kind of shit.
It's a bizarre formula,

2061
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,240
right?

2062
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:07,290
An entertainment company that's also
gonna do aerospace and science will.

2063
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:11,340
The heart of it is when we do what's
called confirmation,

2064
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:15,480
not disclosure confirmation.
A the heart of it is is how do we tell

2065
01:31:15,481 --> 01:31:19,240
stories that galvanized the human race
and let them know a little bit more

2066
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:23,040
about what's going on and how do we
present them science so they understand

2067
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:25,920
the consciousness and a lot of other
things are real.

2068
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:30,390
And how do we build a technology
associated with those stories and with

2069
01:31:30,391 --> 01:31:33,450
dos science that can change the world.
And that's why it's an academy.

2070
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,550
So they have any pickled bodies
anywhere.

2071
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:39,450
I go from Ohio.
I believe they do believe they do.

2072
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,740
Nobody's ever told you that I believe to
get.

2073
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,800
I believe they do.
You believe they do?

2074
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:46,760
You can't say anymore than.
I'm not gonna say anymore than that said

2075
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:49,860
so much what you can and can't say.
Well,

2076
01:31:49,861 --> 01:31:52,920
I can tell you other shit offline.
Probably offline.

2077
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:56,140
I can't wait to end this podcast.
Fucking kick me out.

2078
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:57,690
I tell anybody please.
Some weird shit.

2079
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:59,850
Um,
so now what,

2080
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:00,130
what's

2081
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,320
the timeline for moving forward with all
this stuff?

2082
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,080
Okay.
So in the next few weeks we're going to

2083
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:09,160
be releasing the first declassified
videos of these advanced aerial threat

2084
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,500
Ufos,
um,

2085
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:14,230
and they are current videos that were
just caught and with audio and

2086
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:16,230
everything of the people tracking and
uh,

2087
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,550
and we're going to launch the Beta
version of the community of interest,

2088
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:20,830
which is the partnered website that's
going to be hosting all this

2089
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:23,970
declassified information where we're
gonna be having the hardcore.

2090
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,960
I'm a conversations with people that
want to understand this stuff.

2091
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,340
We're going to be also doing an
experiment with that piece of metal to

2092
01:32:33,341 --> 01:32:36,880
show the world that the technology is
not only real,

2093
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:40,680
but it's,
it's demonstrated and the videos are

2094
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:42,380
very much a proof of concept,
you know,

2095
01:32:42,381 --> 01:32:43,910
it was showing you look at works,
you know,

2096
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:45,970
so we're going to build it.
And um,

2097
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,850
do you think it's gonna be weird for
people to take you seriously because

2098
01:32:48,851 --> 01:32:49,900
you're a rockstar like me.

2099
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:53,470
If you were like some sort of a
physicist scientist that would listen to

2100
01:32:53,471 --> 01:32:54,340
you more.
Well,

2101
01:32:54,341 --> 01:32:57,010
you know,
I remember when Ellen came out years ago

2102
01:32:57,011 --> 01:33:00,410
and he started space x and then he
started test that.

2103
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,900
My,
here's this dude saying all this

2104
01:33:01,901 --> 01:33:03,940
ambitious shit.
I didn't buy any of it.

2105
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:06,510
I think guys a 100 times smarter than
the both of us combined.

2106
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:08,020
The he's fucking gnarly.
I know,

2107
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:11,080
but I'm just saying he caught believable
once a year maybe.

2108
01:33:11,081 --> 01:33:12,250
And maybe I think he is.
I mean,

2109
01:33:12,251 --> 01:33:13,150
shit,
he's bad ass.

2110
01:33:13,151 --> 01:33:16,240
But look at the people.
You know what's interesting to me is you

2111
01:33:16,241 --> 01:33:20,440
haven't seen who are with.
Have you looked at the bios on the shit?

2112
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:21,140
No.
Yeah,

2113
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,250
you got to read the Bios of the people.
I didn't want to be tainted.

2114
01:33:24,251 --> 01:33:27,100
I wanted to talk to one of the,
on my,

2115
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:31,000
on my sat.
The Scientific Board Advisory Board is,

2116
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:33,010
you know,
one of the guys that CIA that headed up

2117
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:35,920
the entire biowarfare program and the
director of operations,

2118
01:33:35,921 --> 01:33:36,870
the client desk nine divisions.

2119
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:40,480
All these guys have found us how various
ways.

2120
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:43,690
So they've come to you because they like
the beacon.

2121
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,690
I did something as this is the way to
go.

2122
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:49,500
I did something that no one thought was
possible.

2123
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:53,980
What's that?
Was tying together a mechanism that can

2124
01:33:53,981 --> 01:33:58,981
perpetually fund itself and can
communicate and can innovate all with

2125
01:34:01,841 --> 01:34:05,590
people that sit at the seat.
I created a round table with engineers,

2126
01:34:05,591 --> 01:34:09,580
scientists until high ranking
intelligence officials and uh,

2127
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:11,730
and some others I can't tell you about
it,

2128
01:34:11,731 --> 01:34:15,670
obviously in the,
in the defense world,

2129
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,620
it's called stove piping.
So when they,

2130
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:21,610
when they compartmentalize a secret,
they put them into these vertical

2131
01:34:21,611 --> 01:34:23,800
categories that can't talk to each
other.

2132
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:28,990
I created a horizontal structure where
all these people in these amazing

2133
01:34:28,991 --> 01:34:33,130
accomplished positions in government
were able to come together at the same

2134
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:38,131
table and they can discuss what we want
to teach the world and how we want to do

2135
01:34:39,011 --> 01:34:39,610
that.

2136
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:42,430
And,
but the but the way to do that is

2137
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,790
including the public and making it a
public benefit corporation.

2138
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,080
And what that means is we're able to
spend money and it's in our charter on

2139
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:53,230
things that can benefit the world and
not just provide a return to the

2140
01:34:53,231 --> 01:34:55,720
investors,
but what we're doing happens to be

2141
01:34:55,721 --> 01:34:57,130
extremely lucrative,
lucrative,

2142
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:58,620
my,
my engine,

2143
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,670
lucrative for investors or insure
investors and the company.

2144
01:35:01,671 --> 01:35:04,160
So it was it like saved young.
Jamie wants to be a part of it.

2145
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,660
What does,
what does he have to do?

2146
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:08,930
You just go to the Stars Academy Dot Com
and you buy shares whatever you want to

2147
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:11,720
buy.
And I will be lucrative for him because

2148
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:15,710
the first of all the technology,
it sounds like a trillion dollar thing.

2149
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:18,920
If we can figure that out over the next
eight years and they think we can.

2150
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:19,640
So they.

2151
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,680
Who's they?
The,

2152
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,310
the engineers that are building this
thing.

2153
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:24,590
The guy.
So Steve Justice that was head of

2154
01:35:24,591 --> 01:35:26,960
advanced programs at the skunk works.
We talked about that.

2155
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:31,190
They build all of our.
They are the tip of the spear for the

2156
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:35,180
most advanced spacecraft and aircraft
that the United States national security

2157
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:37,100
apparatus has period,
period.

2158
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:41,150
Hands down.
And he was the big boy there and their

2159
01:35:41,151 --> 01:35:44,870
model,
we think we have a s,

2160
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:46,490
you know,
this is a,

2161
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,190
this is a guest,
but I think there's a 60 percent chance

2162
01:35:49,191 --> 01:35:52,820
within 36 months or so,
we'll be able to demonstrate something

2163
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:56,780
pretty kick ass and as long as there's
no major obstacle there,

2164
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:59,930
we think within eight years we'll be
able to have something but it's

2165
01:35:59,931 --> 01:36:02,240
expensive and we've got to work with the
government and we're going to have to

2166
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:04,190
work with major aerospace.
For example,

2167
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:08,600
this one meeting I have coming up with,
with a big name aerospace company,

2168
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:11,090
is offering their material sciences
division.

2169
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,640
We need that.
We need to be able to create certain

2170
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:16,550
metals that can resonate and circle
certain frequencies,

2171
01:36:16,551 --> 01:36:18,920
shit like that.
The other way that the company makes

2172
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:23,300
money is when we build this,
the satellite launching system.

2173
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:26,960
That's like exactly what [inaudible]
doing now putting satellites in orbit,

2174
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:29,810
but we don't have to build rockets.
We can launch them with lasers.

2175
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:33,620
That's a big deal.
You point lasers at the bottom of a cube

2176
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,240
sat,
which is like the size of a shoe box,

2177
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,600
and you can put it into low earth orbit
and you can put it up even higher

2178
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,940
without using any fossil fuels with
using light.

2179
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:44,060
That's a big deal.
That's a multibillion dollar gimmick

2180
01:36:44,061 --> 01:36:45,680
right there.
It's just been proven.

2181
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:47,310
I told you,
seeing the proof.

2182
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,380
There's this video of this accident.
It's in our launch video.

2183
01:36:51,381 --> 01:36:54,530
If you watch the video at the top of the
to the Stars Academy Dot Com page,

2184
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:55,880
you'll see shots of it.

2185
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:58,430
We're a little thing's glowing and is
getting beamed up into the sky.

2186
01:36:58,431 --> 01:36:59,710
That's the air force.
Yeah.

2187
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:02,490
My guys were on that project.
Little thing's glowing or.

2188
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,310
Yeah,
like a mass though.

2189
01:37:04,311 --> 01:37:06,050
Like a satellite?
Yeah.

2190
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:07,300
Yeah.
They're called cube to cube.

2191
01:37:07,301 --> 01:37:12,301
Sat is a cube.
Sat is a modular box that you put

2192
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:14,480
together as modules based on what you
need.

2193
01:37:14,481 --> 01:37:15,500
Okay.
I need to thrust her.

2194
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:20,600
I need a sensor and I need a fucking rf
signal thing to send the data back home.

2195
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:22,400
So now you've got three little boxes
attached.

2196
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,020
That's a cube set.
They call them cubes,

2197
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,790
so it's essentially,
um,

2198
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,990
it,
it's probably 80 percent of the

2199
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:33,350
satellite business,
but now they got to put all these cube

2200
01:37:33,351 --> 01:37:38,351
sats together on Musk's rocket that's
also launching giant satellites for dod

2201
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:42,230
or whatever,
but it's super expensive because you

2202
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:44,660
have a rocket and you have all that
fossil fuels and all this stuff.

2203
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:47,990
If he launched these cube sats with
lasers because they're not that heavy

2204
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:49,790
and you can,
like I said,

2205
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:51,380
it would take a cost of launching a
cube,

2206
01:37:51,381 --> 01:37:54,530
sat from 50 grand a pound down to five
grand.

2207
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:57,000
That's huge.
So there's the video of this actually

2208
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:57,930
happening.
That's on your,

2209
01:37:57,931 --> 01:38:01,180
what is the,
to the Stars Academy Dot Com is.

2210
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:05,130
And you can watch the,
you can watch the video and then you go

2211
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:08,070
to the entertainment division,
which is my primary spot.

2212
01:38:08,510 --> 01:38:09,770
Um,
you know,

2213
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:13,230
making movies and selling millions of
books and licensing this stuff out is

2214
01:38:13,231 --> 01:38:15,660
the diff,
is the reason why Disney's $300 billion

2215
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:18,900
in warner brothers is 5 billion warner
brothers just makes movies.

2216
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,140
Disease makes they make franchises and
they're vertically integrated.

2217
01:38:22,141 --> 01:38:24,060
We put up the book,
we put out the t shirts,

2218
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:27,030
we make the movie.
So that's really where we're going.

2219
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:28,260
And we have,
um,

2220
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:33,710
we have three television series that are
probably one of which will be announced

2221
01:38:35,011 --> 01:38:36,030
probably in the next couple of weeks.

2222
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:37,830
The other two were a little further out
on that.

2223
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:39,310
The first film,
uh,

2224
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,340
our first film is first quarter of next
year.

2225
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:45,030
I wrote that one and I'll be directing.
That one's called strange times,

2226
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:48,630
which is like a hard,
our version of the goonies but funny but

2227
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:51,750
scary and fucked up.
But with 17 and 18 year old kids,

2228
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:53,490
um,
and then,

2229
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:55,500
uh,
and then secret machines,

2230
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:56,760
the motion picture,
that's,

2231
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,940
these are all franchises.
So strange times has an animated series

2232
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:02,970
that's coming out.
We have wonderful writer from.

2233
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:03,691
Sorry,
I live,

2234
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:08,040
that's show running the thing.
We have an unscripted show coming out on

2235
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:12,570
the entire company just following us in
a very national geographic way as we do

2236
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:15,690
all these things.
And as we build lasers,

2237
01:39:15,691 --> 01:39:18,180
as we're on the movie sets,
as we're in the lab,

2238
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,770
you know,
pinging that,

2239
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:20,850
those,
uh,

2240
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:22,380
those pieces of metal I told you about.

2241
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:23,371
So,
uh,

2242
01:39:23,371 --> 01:39:25,330
there's a lot of things like that going,
um,

2243
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,260
so when you ask about how do we monetize
all this shit,

2244
01:39:28,261 --> 01:39:30,930
we have a full functioning entertainment
division has been up for a few years.

2245
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:33,600
That's what I've been doing.
And that's how I made the book.

2246
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:38,601
And we've put out seven novels already.
Your end goal is ultimately to expose

2247
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,130
all of this information.
My American,

2248
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:47,180
my end goal is not just that my end goal
is to build a company that changes the

2249
01:39:48,091 --> 01:39:52,620
world and by doing a traditional IPO in
the next five to seven years.

2250
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,890
And to do that,
I grabbed very,

2251
01:39:55,891 --> 01:39:59,640
very high ranking people from various
areas in the government to achieve all

2252
01:39:59,641 --> 01:40:00,790
this stuff.
And they,

2253
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:02,370
they don't need to come in on the
movies.

2254
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:04,110
I have that on lock.
That's my thing.

2255
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:08,460
But it can,
it can function as a way to help people

2256
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:10,860
understand what the fuck is going on.

2257
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:13,230
So some of the movies,
some of the TV series,

2258
01:40:13,231 --> 01:40:17,580
some of the nonfiction works that we do
will all be about that subject,

2259
01:40:17,581 --> 01:40:19,770
but the rest of it won't be all right
dude.

2260
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:23,310
Well that's a very ambitious project and
let us know when you're ready to go to

2261
01:40:23,311 --> 01:40:26,160
the moon or Mars or wherever the fuck
you're going to go.

2262
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:28,650
Yeah,
you can go to your anus all those

2263
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:30,250
places.
And uh,

2264
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:32,130
I hope it's all real.
I'm excited.

2265
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,053
Cool.
Thanks drew.

2266
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:33,940
Thanks for having me.
Oh,

2267
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:34,950
thanks for coming on rather than.
Yeah.

2268
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,053
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

2269
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,490
Bye.
Everybody.
