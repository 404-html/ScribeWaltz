00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,690
I also don't understand why it is
automatically the guy's fault if it's.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,190
If it's consensual.

4
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:11,350
I'm not talking about
someone being incapacitated.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,400
Blackout drunk.

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,020
That's reasonable.

7
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,790
People would see that as an as an assault,

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,860
but just if you're both really drunk,

9
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:19,694
can you have sex?

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,270
Why is he the rapist?

11
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,690
Because that tends to be
what happens on the campus.

12
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,250
They do blame the young man.

13
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,390
They don't say you raped each other,

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,460
that they will take her side.

15
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,390
If she can show they'd had
drinks and I find this a.

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,930
another strange thing that's happening
with feminism today is that it's going

17
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:39,040
the,

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,660
I call it fainting couch feminism.

19
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,020
It's almost as if we're going back to the
Victorian era where there was delicate

20
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:48,070
ladies preyed upon by men and as
if the women aren't moral agents.

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,010
I mean if you take a lot of drinks a year,

22
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:55,540
probably have made a decision to lower
your inhibitions and be wild or what all

23
00:00:55,541 --> 00:01:00,090
kinds of things are going on that would
explain that you're still an agent in

24
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,310
charge of if you're,

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,140
you know,

26
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,370
yourself self mastery,

27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,900
but they deny this of women.

28
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,000
It's all women have no agency
and are constantly triggered,

29
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,760
need safe spaces at Brown university,

30
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:13,151
by the way,

31
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:16,030
they had to feminists debating.

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,740
One of them was a libertarian,

33
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,410
a great Wendy Mackelroy,

34
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:24,340
and she didn't believe the statistics
and another was Jessica Valenti,

35
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,390
hard line feminists.

36
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:26,081
They were debating,

37
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:26,980
but that was fine.

38
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:27,814
It was a debate.

39
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,680
You think that would make everyone happy?

40
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:30,250
Both sides.

41
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,150
Well-Represented.

42
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:31,750
No.

43
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,750
The brown feminists were traumatized
by the very idea that someone would be

44
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,160
invalidating our experience.

45
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,220
They use that phrase and they ha.

46
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,640
They formed a safe room,

47
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,370
a safe space where you could go,

48
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,880
which had videotapes
are frolicking puppies,

49
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,020
coloring books,

50
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,033
bubbles,

51
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
stuffed animals,

52
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,190
and this was described
in the New York Times,

53
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:00,870
but it was a cover story in the
New York Times magazine by July.

54
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,010
Judith Shula visits and this was the
safe space and if you read it and you're,

55
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,050
you're astonished that the of
the infantilization puppies,

56
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,423
puppies

57
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,050
frolicking puppies,

58
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,000
say bubbles.

59
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,930
Coloring books.

60
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,490
I get it.

61
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,950
It's kindergarten for college girls.

62
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,990
It hurts my brain.

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:22,861
You know,

64
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:27,270
this speaks to how people have a
hard time accepting some of this new

65
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:27,841
information.

66
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,960
I have a friend who was a scientist
and a the last time you were on,

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,130
she said to me,

68
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:35,580
did you have a climate
denier on your show,

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,710
a climate change denier?

70
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,720
And I say that he's
definitely not denying it,

71
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,350
but some people,

72
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,430
that's all they hear.

73
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:49,431
When you bring forth a a non mainstream
point of view or a controversial

74
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,171
perspective,

75
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,110
instead of considering the possibility,

76
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:58,830
it almost immediately gets dismissed
as this climate change thing is another

77
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,890
ideological struggle.

78
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,100
Yeah,

79
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,341
sure.

80
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,690
Climate change is taking place,

81
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:02,940
but what are the causes for this?

82
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,860
Are we so sure that it's
all caused by human beings?

83
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,870
I would say there's very good reason for
humanity to clean up our act in lots of

84
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:11,440
ways.

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
Regardless of the issue of climate change.

86
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:13,890
We're living,

87
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,670
we're abusing mother earth.

88
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,290
We're living upon this planet,

89
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,720
parasites and destroying it.

90
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,800
We thoughtlessly create
this gigantic pools of,

91
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,950
of pollution.

92
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,540
We're crazy enough,

93
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,780
insane enough to actually invent
nuclear weapons and you know,

94
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,100
long periods of the detonate
that bloody things you,

95
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,491
you,

96
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:32,920
you know,

97
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,450
this is the lots about our behavior that
we need to fix because it's right to

98
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,860
fix it philosophically,

99
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,190
right?

100
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,390
We should not behave that way.

101
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,100
We should not behave
that way to one another.

102
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,170
We should not behave
that way to planet earth.

103
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,770
But to say that we need to fix our
behavior because of global warming.

104
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,750
That's an ideological argument and that
argument remains to be properly tested.

105
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,051
Yes,

106
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,160
global warming is occurring,

107
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,140
but are we the cause of
it or is something else,

108
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:56,470
some,

109
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,140
some grander scale cosmic
effect involved in this?

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:03:59,900
Well,

111
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,560
we talked about that considerably and I
noticed in a lot of the comments from,

112
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,790
from our last discussion,

113
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,160
most of the critical
comments where people,

114
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,713
you know,

115
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,070
not liking the idea that I had
questioned the dogma of global warming,

116
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,850
but there are some facts that you
can't escape the global warming.

117
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:18,120
Again,

118
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,020
200 years ago,

119
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,160
and we see that the glaciers from the
little ice age began to shrink back in the

120
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,170
early 19th century before there was a
century before there was any significant

121
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,800
human contract contribution
of Sio two to the atmosphere.

122
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,670
So something was driving
that warming that began,

123
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,590
and it's important to realize that the
little ice age was probably the coldest

124
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,070
period since the end of the great ice age.

125
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,173
In fact,

126
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,590
the data overwhelmingly supports that
and that the glaciers grew to the largest

127
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,990
extent around the planet and 10,000 years.

128
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,330
So when we're talking
about glacier recession,

129
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:57,240
it's important to understand
what the baseline is.

130
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,430
Our baseline in this case is the biggest.

131
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,290
The glaciers have been in 10,000 years.

132
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,430
And what's interesting,

133
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:05,370
and this is going on right
now as the glaciers have been,

134
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,204
receding.

135
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Geologists and biologists
and and glaciologists and
so forth have been studying

136
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,830
the landscapes that are being revealed
as the ice shrinks back and you know,

137
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:21,831
what they're finding is the remains of
forests that had been overrun by the

138
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,640
Little Ice Age glaciers up,

139
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,190
you know,

140
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,780
and and,

141
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,760
and peat bogs and things that would
suggest that prior to the onset of the

142
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:30,780
little ice age,

143
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,050
those valleys that were filled with ice
from roughly 1400 to 1800 were actually

144
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,360
forested because the ice came down
and overran these forests and now it's

145
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:45,810
receding back and revealing
that there were forests there.

146
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,130
So that tells you that,

147
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,400
you know,

148
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
at some point,

149
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,000
probably going back to
the medieval warm period.

150
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,830
Those areas that were,

151
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,000
that have been glaciated during the early
part of the 20th century were actually

152
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,183
of ice.

153
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,180
And so,

154
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,570
you know,

155
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,970
the climate has been extremely dynamic.

156
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,840
That's the thing we have to emphasize
all by itself without any help from

157
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:06,674
humans.

158
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,690
And this is what I've been saying,

159
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,780
is that we have to look
at that and realize that,

160
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,020
yeah,

161
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,220
humans are a factor.

162
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,001
You know,

163
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:18,440
somebody I did post and said all the
other factors I had mentioned as you know,

164
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:22,700
ocean currents and wind currents and
geomagnetic field and cosmic rays and

165
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,780
volcanism and all that.

166
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,340
It all been investigated in dismissed
and the only thing left was the human

167
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,180
contribution.

168
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
But you know,

169
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,550
to me that's really.

170
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,760
We're putting all our eggs in that
basket and that could turn out to be very

171
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:39,761
dangerous because we're so focused now
on our own contribution that we might be

172
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,690
overlooking the fact that there have been
natural factors driving climate change

173
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,490
over and over and over again.

174
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,490
I mean because I still have not heard
any consensus on what has caused the

175
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:56,090
planet to first go into an ice age
and come back out of an ice age.

176
00:06:56,091 --> 00:07:00,520
And I think that what Graham and I
are talking about actually presents a

177
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,570
possible solution to what could have
brought this planet out of the Ice Age.

178
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,100
Something on a grand cosmic scale.

179
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,420
And the other point I think I'd like
to make is that we have to really to

180
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,460
understand our planet as a system.

181
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,650
We have to realize that it's part of a
cosmic ecosystem and the cosmos has been

182
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,260
a much bigger player in what's been going
on down here then has been previously

183
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,100
understood or appreciated.

184
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:25,190
Yeah.
