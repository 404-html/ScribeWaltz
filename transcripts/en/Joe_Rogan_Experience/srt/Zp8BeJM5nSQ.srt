1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,000
Do we live? Did I say moral technique on
the air? Maybe. Good. I said good things.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,010
I love that dude.
He'll be here on Monday.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,140
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by ting. Now,

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,520
if you've seen the teen news recently,
and let me see, ting dropped their rates.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,020
They uh, to celebrate,
celebrate, celebrate.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,150
They um, dropped their prices
to celebrate two years.

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,370
They cut their rates in half. Um,
let me see exactly what they did.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,740
They slashed their prices permanently
there permanently slashing prices to

9
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:40,280
celebrate their second birthday.
I fucking love shit like that.

10
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:43,880
When you don't have to do stuff like that
and you'd do it just because you want

11
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:47,120
people to feel good about
your company. What, uh,

12
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:51,440
what I enjoy the most about ting is
the feedback. [inaudible] excuse me.

13
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:54,080
The feedback that we get from people
that have used it, it's all positive.

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,120
I haven't had one person say, Eh dated,
but I didn't really see them many.

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,790
According to 10, 98% of people save
money. Let's see what exactly they did.

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,660
Ting trajectory toward shorter,

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,660
I'm trying to find the news just as
drops. Prices. Google it. Oh, I know.

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,020
I shouldn't tell you to Google it. I
should have this nose, but I don't,

19
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:21,410
didn't come. I had to find it online.
It didn't come as a part of the ad thing

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,560
anyway,
they dropped their prices a lot.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,230
So since I can't find the
news that quickly, uh,

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,470
just accept that permanently
permanently dropped the prices,

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,450
which is a fucking tricky thing to say.

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,400
You permanently draft
your issue permanently.

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,520
What about a hundred fucking
thousand years from now, dude?

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,930
How much is that chicken across then?

27
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,470
People got to be careful because
the world will still be around.

28
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:53,530
Maybe that's what everybody
planted for the apocalypse with.

29
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:57,550
That motherfucker never comes.
What if it never comes and you stay alive?

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,410
Then what bitch? Huh? Then what? Anyway,

31
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,290
this episode brought to
you by Tang and ting.

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,620
Would they are is a mobile
company that uses sprint backbone.

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,380
They buy time on sprint
and rented out to you,

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,050
but they do it in a way that most
cell phone companies don't like.

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,630
They don't have any contracts
and live any bullshit.

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,810
They don't have any
early termination fees.

37
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:24,730
They're truly and completely contract
free and they sell the best android phones

38
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,660
in the world. I switched to android
and I'm very happy with it and I also,

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm even more happier because,
uh,

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,890
once we had a end dress Antonopoulos on
the podcast and the day talking to us

41
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:37,330
about Bitcoin,
um,

42
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:40,540
he was talking about how the Apple
App for Bitcoin is not very good.

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,560
Then apple pulled it.
They actually pulled the fucking app.

44
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,110
Did they give a reason
for why they pulled it?

45
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,750
It's gross because 120,000 people,

46
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:52,810
it already downloaded that bitcoin app
and they were using it and apple just

47
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:57,390
decided for whatever fucking reason that
they're not going to let you download

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,210
it anymore. It's, I think
gross when you download,

49
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,830
I mean if you have something
that's as mainstream as Bitcoin,

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,140
I mean,
I wouldn't say bitcoins mainstream,

51
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,740
but when you get to be 120,000 downloads,
that's pretty,

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,640
pretty significant and growing.
It's clearly growing. I mean,

53
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,610
every day I see in the
news things about Bitcoin,

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,590
different companies accepting Bitcoin,
Vegas casinos accepting bitcoin.

55
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,670
And so for apple to step in
with no explanation, unless
there's an explanation,

56
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:30,490
like they don't like the software,
it has vulnerability.

57
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,260
They thought they should
have to tell you that.

58
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,130
But if you just pull it and don't say
a word that's smacks of censorship.

59
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:39,790
To me that sounds gross.
I don't know what's going on,

60
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:44,710
but more and more I'm,
I'd lean towards android and,

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,430
um,

62
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,430
I just think there's a billion fucking
people that are using cell phones,

63
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:52,000
probably more in the world.

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,750
And something like 80% of them
are on the android platform now.

65
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:59,020
Something like 80 something percent
smartly. Let me find that out for sure.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,820
How many people use android?

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,850
Apple dropped it for a unresolved issue.
What does that mean?

68
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,250
That doesn't mean anything.
You didn't say a word.

69
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,710
She didn't say that we dropped it
for an unresolved issue. Oh, okay.

70
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,020
What does that mean? You want to be king
of the world and it didn't work out yet.

71
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,100
The fuck did you do? Huh?
You sons of bitches? Um,

72
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,690
uh, whatever, it's, whatever the
numbers are, who gives a shit?

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,240
It's a very high number of people
that are using a android. It's um,

74
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,350
in, uh, it depends on where
you're at. There's worldwide,
worldwide, it's like 70%.

75
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,690
It looks like,
um,

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,720
this is pretty crazy that
the numbers are growing too.

77
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,330
It wasn't one point in time,
like almost all the smartphones,

78
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:47,200
like good percentage of when the iPhone
and then slowly but surely the enter it

79
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:51,550
started to get better and better. And now
they, uh, they're actually the majority,

80
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,890
uh, and there's so many
people working on them too.

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,050
There's the new ones are pretty
fucking bad ass. So if you're like a,

82
00:04:57,051 --> 00:05:01,300
an iPhone person, uh, and you're
worried you don't have to the uh,

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,530
the new ones are pretty fucking dope.

84
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,090

85
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,910
They have the devices up there.
If you go and look at their website,

86
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:14,110
they have all the cool ones, like the one
I have, which is the galaxy note three,

87
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,460
just, it's enormous. But I love it
because it's just great for email.

88
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,250
And looking at pictures and shit.
But another one that's smaller,

89
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,690
that's also very bad.

90
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:27,691
Asses the HTC one or the galaxy s four
all the top of the line phones they sell,

91
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,080
they sell them all at a ting.

know what lead is? Do you remember?

102
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,900
is actually the domain name
company that I use personally. Me,

103
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm super easy to use.

104
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,900
A monkey like me got on hover and
registered domain names with no problems

105
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,220
whatsoever.
Very,

106
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:25,450
very easy to do and they give you a
lot of stuff for free to hover, um,

107
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,940
that you would normally pay for it.
Like who is domain name privacy,

108
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:33,470
which is pretty important when you were
registering some freaky ass websites.

109
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,620
You don't want people to know where you
sleep. You know what I'm saying, Dawg.

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,830
Exactly. Um, also you
can set up emails. Um,

111
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,350
you can have email from your
website. They'll, they'll
set that stuff up for you.

112
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,230
Hover gives you exactly what
you need to get the job done.

113
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:51,800
You find the perfect domain name for
your idea to live so that you can get

114
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:55,010
started and move on to the
next thing on your to do list.

115
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,510
I don't know why they
want you to say that.

116
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,760
How do I know if you have a
next thing I used to do this,

117
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,800
I don't want to pressure you mad.
Okay.

118
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,900
If all you need to do is fucking
register your domain name just to that,

119
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,500
don't worry about it. You're going to
be okay. We're all going to be okay.

120
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,900
They have email forwarding
for just five bucks.

121
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:15,050
You can keep using the same
inbox you're used to and uh,

122
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,270
send them from a way better address.

123
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,170
Sorry for people who don't like me
slurping, it doesn't bother me. However,

124
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:25,730
has the best customer support around.

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,930
Go there and enjoy it and
use the code word freaks.

126
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,320
That is for the month of February.
Um,

127
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,660
why freaks think they want to distinguish
which one of these podcasts you were

128
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:42,380
listening to when you found out about
their awesome domain name service.

129
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,150
So for this month it's freaks.

130
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,750
I find that all to be very confusing and
I'm not really until you switch around

131
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:54,440
your fucking passwords, people
get it together. But either way.

132
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,410
Awesome web service. I use it, I enjoy it.

133
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,230
And you should as well
use the code word freaks.

134
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:05,231
That's hover h a v e r.com the best place
on the net to register your domains.

135
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,900
And we're also brought to you by on it.
I'm Aubrey,

136
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:12,310
I think you know a thing or two about
honor. You've heard of the company? Yeah,

137
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,140
a little bit controversial
place that sells awesome shit.

138
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,850
And I'm one of the newest
that, uh, I really enjoy.

139
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:24,200
I've been mixing in my protein shakes.
Is this a the new Greens supplement?

140
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,210
Tell me about that shit.
Well,

141
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:30,590
what we wanted to do is just get a bunch
of the healthiest stuff you could and

142
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,250
freeze dried powdered format.
So we got a bunch of the actual Greens,

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,760
then we got some of the different colored
vegetables like beets and some of the

144
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:41,090
other things that you might be missing
from your diet. Put in some probiotics,

145
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,230
put in some enzymes,

146
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:46,220
a few of the herbs that are good for liver
and some of your organs and basically

147
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,390
put together kind of a, Oh shit,
I haven't had my diet right.

148
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,020
Kind of Greens that you can add and make
sure that you're at least covered from

149
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:56,340
a micronutrient micro vitamin

150
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,840
basis that just has basically all
the good nutrients in it possible.

151
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,250
Well, it's a great mix of stuff too.
Um, I've, I've read the ingredients,

152
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,820
the ingredients list. It's pretty fucking
powerful. How did you, uh, how'd you,

153
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,500
how'd you formulate this?
Well,

154
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:14,490
one of the key things that we found is I
was looking at antioxidant potential as

155
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:15,420
well.
And you know,

156
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,720
I'm fairly familiar with Peru and kind
of some of the things that come out of

157
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:22,410
there and there was a purple corn that
comes out of Peru that they grow pretty

158
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:27,180
much exclusively in that region and it
has it really, really high or act value.

159
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,360
And Oreck is, is a useful tool.
It's not the end all be all,

160
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,880
but it's an antioxidant measurement.

161
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,510
You know how many free radicals get
quenched by the natural compound.

162
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,620
And that's a process that goes on normally
in the body and it's a really high

163
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,290
amount of that more so than even some
of the other berries like us, I, he,

164
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:48,630
Barry and all these other barriers that
get really highly touted. So we put,

165
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,051
you know,

166
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:52,230
a bunch of that in there and then just
went from there and got a bunch of full

167
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:56,310
spectrum Greens and put it all together.
Everything being food based, you know,

168
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,920
just all the coolest,
best foods that we could get,

169
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,400
which is the best way for your body
to absorb. Absolutely. All this,

170
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,480
the best supplements that you can get
or are food based and which is why those

171
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,350
studies that came out
recently were so stupid

172
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,740
and annoying because if you don't
know the studies we're talking about,

173
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:17,741
there's a this really bold proclamation
from whatever study vitamins don't work,

174
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:21,230
they're not worth it. It's
waiting now, not worth your time.

175
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,360
And they're conclusion.
Closed case closed.

176
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:28,130
Their conclusions were based on two of
the grossest studies ever for saying that

177
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:29,210
vitamins don't work.

178
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:34,211
One of them was people over 65 that have
had heart attacks that were fucking old

179
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:38,870
and had heart attacks and it didn't stop
there. Their progression of, you know,

180
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,440
death or whatever, which is ridiculous.
You're over 65 you have a heart attack,

181
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,570
you're fucking, that's
like saying, you know,

182
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:47,000
I had a 72 Pontiac with a blown motor.

183
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:50,720
It was going down the highway and you
change the tire and it didn't fucking fix

184
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:54,240
my car. Like your machine's
already broken men. You've,

185
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,430
you're having a heart attack at 65
like this shit is close to the end.

186
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,020
The wheels are falling off the ride.

187
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,590
And the other one was physicians who
are over 65 who were showing cognitive

188
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:10,820
decline. It didn't slow down
their cognitive decline. Okay,

189
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:15,140
so vitamins don't work because of that.
Like what the fuck man?

190
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,110
People are really gross with that shit
where they want to say it doesn't work.

191
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,720
Doesn't work. Why is that? Because
a lot of stuff doesn't work,

192
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,880
but a lot of stuff does.
All right,

193
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:26,330
and that's why these vitamins
were made in the first place.

194
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,770
The whole reason why they were extracted
from food analyzed is because people

195
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:34,460
needed to know what the basic
compounds of nutrients where.

196
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,910
What is it about vitamin C that
keeps people from getting scurvy?

197
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,550
What is it about vitamin B
12 that gives you energy?

198
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,940
What is it about vitamin D that you get
from the sign? All the, this is science.

199
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,200
Like everyone's pretending
that this is all like, oh,

200
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,180
the pseudo science of supplements.
Fuck you. You fat, lazy piece of Shit.

201
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:53,000
You don't know nothing about your body.
All right, that's what's going on.

202
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,620
All you fucking people that are
like, you know, you don't need that.

203
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,370
Eat a balanced guy. Oh really? Doctor.
Well, why don't you run up a hill with me?

204
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,250
Fuck. Why don't you tell me about
optimum physical performance?

205
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:07,990
You don't know unless you supplement.
Unless you have a healthy body,

206
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,350
you don't know the difference
between optimum and suboptimum.

207
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,850
You just exist at this sub optimum
state and thanks. Wow. What she,

208
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:16,240
I have a cup of coffee.

209
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,500
I have my eggs and bacon and I go to
work and I've got no problem whatsoever

210
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,140
with my health. Why? I just
got back from a doctor.

211
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,660
People always want to tell you that I
just got back from the doctor with a clean

212
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,400
Palette health.
I'll fucking strangle.

213
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:31,530
You know you don't have a clean bill
of health. You're fucking dying, man.

214
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,480
Look at your face has fallen
off your skin. Stop it. Yeah.

215
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:39,100
There's a difference between being okay
surviving and being optimal and to be

216
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,740
optimal. You got put in, you
know, how are you going to eat?

217
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,890
There's 24 natural ingredients
in this [inaudible].

218
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,410
How are you going to get these
24 ingredients in every day diet?

219
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,310
It's going to be a pain
in the [inaudible].

220
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,200
You could have a 10 inch television
who needs a 55 inch television.

221
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,360
I watch TV on a 10 inch television
and I'm fine. I don't need a new car.

222
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,120
I've got a 1958 Subaru.

223
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,280
Did they even make Subaru's
in 58 probably not.

224
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,210
That's probably all shitty American cars
back then and a couple of Ferrari's.

225
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,550
It's probably all they had either way.

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Shut up all of you and go to the blog
that Aubrey wrote about this because it's

227
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:18,480
a very good blog and is there a
straight link to the blog from the,

228
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:22,410
the main site? I'm trying to find your
hair, get on it and then blog. Yeah,

229
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,300
get on it and then blog, um, or being,

230
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:29,500
or being on it and blog if
you've never been on it before,

231
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:33,070
what we call on it is a human
optimization website. Well, we sell,

232
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,480
whether it's supplements or whether it's
strength and conditioning equipment is

233
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:42,481
all stuff that we a know works and be
used when it comes to kettle bells when it

234
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:43,720
comes to battle ropes.

235
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,370
Those are my absolute favorite strength
and conditioning pieces of equipment.

236
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,410
There's nothing to me
better than kettle bells.

237
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,820
I think there's nothing that
I've ever done that, uh,

238
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:57,460
I feel like I have full control over.
Like I don't, I don't worry about it.

239
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,470
Like there's certain
things that I worry about,

240
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,940
like I've run with sandbags up hills
and I think there's a lot of tricky shit

241
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:06,430
when you're running up hills and like,
you know,

242
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:11,230
a rocky terrain and stuff like dirt, dirt
trails when you're running over things.

243
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:12,730
Like,
I like it.

244
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,090
I think it's a great way to like really
build some serious endurance. But man,

245
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:18,380
I don't really feel totally in control.
I'm kind of sandbag.

246
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,760
I'm running up a hill, done it with
heavy bags too, like, you know, like, uh,

247
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,360
kicking bags.
But with kettle bells,

248
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:30,280
I feel like I can get an absolutely
fucking brutal death defying workout in.

249
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,460
And I know what I'm doing.
I use proper technique.

250
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,140
I don't get hurt using kettle bells.
Man.

251
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:40,141
I can just absolutely say that I have
been using kettle bells for at least a

252
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,020
decade now. I have zero injuries from
training with Kettlebells, kettlebells.

253
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,640
And one of the reasons folks is I got
a trainer, okay. Um, I've had several.

254
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,820
The first one was Jamie Walsh,
my English friend, the night

255
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,200
I, Steve Maxwell also have someone, uh,

256
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,060
Justin Milo's, who's the best love this
fucking guy, the guy I'm using now.

257
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:01,160
It's a good friend of mine as well.

258
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,950
Find someone who can teach you the
basic fundamentals, whether it's,

259
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,950
you know, a gym that you have to hire
a trainer and let them, you know,

260
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,490
tape you with a cell phone so you can
repeat your movements or watch a video.

261
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:18,740
If you don't have anybody anywhere near
where you live that has a kettle bells

262
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:22,100
or understands how you watch
a video and start out light,

263
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,360
use like an 18 pound kettle bell
or 25 pound kettle ball. Trust me,

264
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,350
you will be fucking manly, man. I
don't need a 25 pound kettle. You know,

265
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,180
you'd also don't need torn ligaments.

266
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,370
You don't need to drop a kettle
bell in your head. Stupid.

267
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,660
You don't need to fuck up.

268
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,470
Your Turkey has get up and now you have
a different face. All right? Be careful,

269
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,460
but if you aren't careful,

270
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,920
you will enjoy the fuck out of it and
you'll join the fuck out of everything.

271
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,170
We sell it on it. That's O. N N I t.

272
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,520
Use the codeword Rogan and save
yourself 10% off any n all supplements.

273
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:53,570
My brother Aubrey Marcus is here.
Yeah, buddy. Same time. Cue The music.

274
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,230
Joe Rogan Experience Joe
Rogan podcast all day.

275
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,163
Okay,

276
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,350
and here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
One more time. Live kicking it.

277
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,590
W never worry whether or not we're going
to run out of shit to talk about it.

278
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,490
I don't ever want you to worry about that.
Before we had this conversation,

279
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,990
obviously we still have
shit to talk about.

280
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,630
We're always going to have shit
to talk about it. There's no,

281
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,070
the world is a crazy fucking place filled
with madness and d is never going to

282
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,860
change and there's, oh,
we shouldn't talk about,

283
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,870
that's the most beautiful
thing about having a podcast.

284
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:38,640
It's like being a dirt minor now. That's
just fucking dirt everywhere, man.

285
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,360
You can't go wrong. There's always
something to talk about. And Jamie,

286
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:47,361
you sent me something over this weekend
that was a about the drugs are getting

287
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,400
fucked over or uh, getting
fucked off at. Yeah.

288
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,760
Yeah. It happened this week
actually, I think it was Tuesday. Um,

289
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,510
Cup quite a few congressmen got their
chance to take their shot out. My,

290
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,433
I suppose,

291
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,280
and this is the drugs are under the Obama
administration called the czar is kind

292
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,270
of Russian.
Why are you doing drugs are,

293
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:10,320
that's a fucking stupid. Do you think
gluten makes us hookers? Columns are, uh,

294
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,760
he probably has some American name.

295
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:15,000
You'll call me president of the
United States because present though,

296
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,100
they all want to be president,
United States,

297
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,400
all those gangsters that
are running those, you know,
they know Russia is a mess.

298
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,660
You don't want to run that thing.

299
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:25,350
They should be fucking running America
flying over New York City and fucking

300
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:30,030
Soluton people. But no trap in that
frozen wasteland with a few goods.

301
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,480
Scott got some stars and stripes boxer
briefs that he pulls out. Bay does.

302
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,680
I bet it does. Basically, he's a
secret. Want to be American, right?

303
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,590
So what did they say to
this fucking Bizarre Colin?

304
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,830
I'm not quite sure the czar gets
his chance to talk back to this guy.

305
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:45,110
This went on for like an hour and
a half. Quite a few. Like I said,

306
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,460
quite a few guys got their chance at them.
Um,

307
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,800
talk about low hanging fruit.
Well,

308
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,970
shitting on the drugs. Are they
mean if the Zen, it's this effort.

309
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,530
Has there ever been any sort of a company,
any sort of a,

310
00:17:58,531 --> 00:17:59,364
an off,

311
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,380
any sort of an office that has had less
success than the people that look for

312
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:09,300
the war on drugs? The
abolitionist, a banning alcohol
and the 20s and right. Good.

313
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,470
That's even like less because they
abandoned that one. Yeah, they gave up.

314
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,040
Fuck it.
We tap out.

315
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,850
The war on drugs is like a dude that
just keeps getting his ass kicked.

316
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,520
Just getting up. Keep getting
his ass kicked. Did you,

317
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:25,200
you're not even close
to winning this fight.

318
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,970
There's no way you're
going to win this fight.

319
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,200
Like the idea of a war on
drugs and being run by Ozar.

320
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,780
Holy Schmoe.
What up fucking what a terrible job.

321
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,960
You guys have done. Out of all
the things we think about, look,

322
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:43,770
the great thing with the Department
of, uh, what a transportation,

323
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:47,370
whoever's done the highway
systems, I mean, it's amazing.

324
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,120
You can drive from
California to New York City.

325
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,940
You could do it in four days.
Anybody can do it.

326
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,320
You could drive all the way up to Canada.
You drive down to Florida. I mean,

327
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,750
you could literally make your
way across the entire country,

328
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,970
visit every state by car.

329
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,230
I mean that had to be worked out slowly
but surely. We had a paved roads.

330
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:11,280
We had to chop down trees, blow holes
through mountains. That was awesome.

331
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,290
They did an amazing job.
I mean,

332
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,870
people that want to complain about
the highway system, dude, what?

333
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:19,380
You make your own highway. Let's see what
you would do. Yeah. It's not perfect.

334
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,280
It's made by humans. Nothing we do
is perfect, but then the drugs are,

335
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:26,780
it's like creating a highway where
only people crash. Yeah, that's it.

336
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,260
It's just only crashes and falls apart.
It's just bridges fall down.

337
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,990
You run straight into mountains
where they're supposed to be tunnels.

338
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,510
Sometimes it's concrete. Sometimes it's
paper over Saint Coles don't tell Ya.

339
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,960
Yeah. Yeah. I mean they're their
fate. A total abject failures.

340
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,200
There's never been like EP department
that has failed more like across though.

341
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:51,210
Even in the fucking immigration,
they stopped some of that shit,

342
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,590
you know they fucking have,
you know,

343
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,680
everybody knows about those
border patrol guys. They,

344
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,170
they have a run across the border if
they want to make it into America.

345
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:02,070
There's a lot of work and crossing
into from Mexico into America.

346
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:06,060
It's not a done deal, but the war
on drugs get the fuck outta here.

347
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,130
The amount of damage you've done
to drugs is absolutely zero.

348
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,150
All you've taken a few drugs out
of the system. The fuck you have.

349
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,350
You've just made them more expensive and
a commodity so people can create these

350
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,260
gangster organizations.
Yeah.

351
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,560
Even even crazier that that part
create these Mexican cartels.

352
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,460
Well, you remember when we were kids
in Mexico was a nice place to visit.

353
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:29,970
Fuck yeah.

354
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,330
I'm going to be telling some stories about
going over just going over the border

355
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:36,420
of Mexico. This was 15
years ago, 14 years ago.

356
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,450
It wasn't that scary that me and Eddie
Bravo went to a spring break in Mexico at

357
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:47,440
Cane Kuhn bought it the
first year and that was work.

358
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,560
It was kind crazy. We
got hammered too. It was,

359
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,710
it was a work get way too hammered and
then recover and then fly home disaster

360
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,320
for fucking pounding headache.
I was doing something for MTV.

361
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm glad you remember it.
Yeah, I don't think he does,
but, but we had a good time.

362
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,010
Um, but my point is there was no
apprehension. You know, we were like, oh,

363
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:11,620
it's going to be fun. We're going
to go a see a bunch of concerts.

364
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,270
Like puddle of Mudd was there.

365
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,900
I met the rock and it was the first time
I met the rock who's a skinnier version

366
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,940
of the rock, but I was a skinnier
version of me too. Um, and uh, you know,

367
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:24,340
met a bunch of people. They were
back. It was fun. It was a big deal.

368
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:25,840
We're just going to go
to Mexico just like,

369
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:29,230
you know how I feel like if I would go to
Australia, yeah, it's cool. Here we are.

370
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,500
But now it's like fucking beheadings
and chainsaws and people hanging from

371
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:39,970
bridges and body bags, plastic hefty
bags filled with chopped up people.

372
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:44,190
And he leans out from his Cape and says,
you're welcome world.

373
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,880
You're welcome. Could I have done
my fingers? Wave prevented crying.

374
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,280
Imagine what it would be if I wasn't here

375
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,060
and what a shit job.

376
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,860
Because they've literally pumped up
gigantic criminal organizations by keeping

377
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:03,850
people from legitimately selling
things that they want to sell.

378
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,640
And we're not even done lean.
There's,

379
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,470
there's always gonna be something that
the community doesn't want and there's

380
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:13,870
always going to be idiots
who want that something,

381
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:19,020
whether it's smelling paint those crazy
fucks that blow paint into a paper bag

382
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,180
and then they huff it. That's what
they're doing. I mean, they're just,

383
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,530
they're taking fucking paint and they're
smelling it. You can't prevent that.

384
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,770
You can't prevent that kind of
retard. You can't, you can't stop it.

385
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,840
So as long as there are hammers,

386
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,450
there's going to be someone that hits
himself in the fucking face with a hammer.

387
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,480
There's no,
there's no way to prevent that.

388
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,360
So to to make things completely across
the board illegal just because they're

389
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,203
dangerous.

390
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,200
That sets a really fucked up precedent
because you've got to start examining all

391
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,950
the other things that are
legal. Like here, I don't want
to suggest this, but here,

392
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,430
how come you could get a lighter at a
fucking gas station and how come that gas

393
00:22:56,831 --> 00:23:01,831
station has a pump that pours flammable
liquid on it and there's no guards

394
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:03,904
anywhere.

395
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,940
There's no one to stop you from just
pouring flammable liquid on someone's car

396
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:11,980
and lighting a match and throwing it on
there. There's no one there to stop that.

397
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,010
But everybody's worried that
people are going to have guns. Oh,

398
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:16,930
what's the people with the
guns are going to kill,

399
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,810
but they're her walk random and
the people and just kill people.

400
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,900
They could also light you on
fire at the gas station. Okay.

401
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,300
That doesn't happen now, you know? I mean,

402
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,360
we can't stop people from selling saws
at fucking home depot because someone

403
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:34,150
runs out and just runs into the mall.
Just start sewing at people. We can't.

404
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,140
And the other argument was all loaded
gun is more effective tool. That's true.

405
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,200
So bombs. Okay. And you can
make those. There's the fucking,

406
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,980
you can make real legitimate bombs at
of all the things that you could find

407
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,690
in your average chemical store,

408
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,230
things that are legal and you can make
them bite with the ingredients on the

409
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:52,490
Internet.
It's out there,

410
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,390
but then you take this back to drugs
and let's say it's not actually,

411
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:59,660
most of these drugs are not anything
like taking a hammer and hitting yourself

412
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:03,560
in the head. It's actually, you know,
as we've all seen, and we'll talk about,

413
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm sure on this one,
as we always do,

414
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,350
myriad benefits from all of these
different drugs. And not only that,

415
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,270
so let's say it was like a hammer.

416
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:13,760
Let's say it was punching yourself
in the head with a hammer. Well,

417
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:18,590
the punishment for doing that to prevent
you from doing that is to throw you in

418
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:23,591
a box with crazy criminals and completely
dehumanize you where you may or may

419
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:28,940
not get raped. Who knows? I watched a lot
of Oz. It looks like it sucks and there,

420
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,740
but there's no possible way that that
isn't worse than what you're doing to

421
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:36,650
yourself when you're taking
some drugs in your house. Yeah.

422
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:38,540
They're not trying to help you,

423
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,070
not just punishing you and making it
scary for everybody else. And by the way,

424
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:48,050
I'm not against gun regulations at all.
I should just be real clear about that.

425
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,210
I'm also not against drug regulations.

426
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,530
I think it shouldn't be easy to go
to a doctor and just get oxycontin's.

427
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,350
I think there's a reason why,
and by the way,

428
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,290
whoever sent me some information
about that apparently, uh,

429
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,780
since we had that podcast
with the people from vanguard,

430
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,720
did the oxycontin
express that documentary,

431
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,880
apparently Florida has tightened down
there a drug laws substantially because of

432
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:14,360
that,

433
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,890
because that documentary exposed how
fucking insane that whole oxycontin

434
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:21,350
expresses that goes from
Florida to the northern states.

435
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,940
It's just a pipeline of Oxycontin and
the massive amount of people that have

436
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,780
prescriptions for it.

437
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,990
But now it's apparently becoming a real
issue for the people that are addicted

438
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,870
because now they're fucked because
they don't have anything to fill.

439
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:35,620
That addiction that was created
by the pharmaceutical companies,

440
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,800
making sure that the drug prescription
laws were very lax in Florida,

441
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:44,450
so they can profit. It's all
fucking bananas. So yeah,

442
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,250
that would help Ibogaine,
um, the, I'm not,

443
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,860
I'm not against regulation. Like, you
know, everybody thinks that it's a,

444
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,990
this is a black and white
thing. It's like, no, it's
not a black and white thing,

445
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,860
but you can't tell people
what to do either. You know,
I'm not against regulation,

446
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,320
but I'm,
I'm against you telling people what to do,

447
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:06,740
especially if you can't prove your point.
And when,

448
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,370
when you start talking about
marijuana or psychedelics,

449
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,460
when it's mushrooms or even Lsd,

450
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,850
the amount of danger that you are in when
you take LSD and compare the amount of

451
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:23,450
danger that you take when you eat
salt, you know, you could eat,

452
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,320
we found out 10 ounces of salt.
We'll fucking kill you.

453
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,800
10 ounces. That's it.
Nobody thinks about that.

454
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,150
But you fucking sprinkles salt in your
fries and salt on this and saw it at

455
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:37,640
fucking salted Carmel ice cream.
It was delicious.

456
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,640
Like we don't think about salt
being murderous and deadly,

457
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,310
but at a certain level it is.
You get to a certain amount of salt,

458
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,144
we'll fuck you up.

459
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,590
So I'll acid and this is an LD 50 for
most things as an LD 50 for mushrooms.

460
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,470
It's quite high.
LD 50 for marijuana,

461
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,120
1500 pounds in 15 minutes.
It's, come on, man.

462
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,180
You when you'd say assault is legal
and 10 ounces will kill you. I Dunno,

463
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,770
I'm beating like two brownies that
I'm pretty sure I'm not a die.

464
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,720
I've been there when I'm like,
I'm not going to be the number one guy,

465
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,650
the first guy to die. I'm going
to fuck up the whole cause. Well,

466
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:17,300
you know what does die. That was your
ego. That's why I feel like that there's,

467
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,300
people don't understand what a deep
psychedelic experience eating wheat is.

468
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,840
It's insanely psychedelic and really,

469
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,210
especially if you can do
it with an isolation tank,

470
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,660
eating the weed and getting
it to the tag is like,

471
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,150
it was so fucking cyclone a vortex.

472
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,930
It takes you to the center of
the universe and destroys you,

473
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,700
like destroys,

474
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:43,380
like just highlights everything that you
don't like about everything you've ever

475
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:47,970
said brings up shit that you said a decade
ago. And he was like, what about this?

476
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,490
Have you cleaned that up yet? What
about that? Do you remember this?

477
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,820
This should make you feel bad.

478
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,740
Bob Marley said it's the mirror that
reveals you to yourself. It really does.

479
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,840
People don't like that,
but you should.

480
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,540
I talked to somebody yesterday and the
only drug he'd ever done was he one time

481
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,940
he smoked weed and he liked it and
he's like, oh, that was awesome.

482
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,600
So he made a bunch of brownies and they
didn't really know what they were doing

483
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,440
and he just ate a bunch of them right?
And then had,

484
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,740
and he was trying to drive somewhere and
meet people and he said it was like the

485
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:20,220
most miserable experience. He's going
40 miles an hour on the highway.

486
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:23,830
He's freaking out. He's sweating. It's
the second time he's ever done any,

487
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,030
ate too much. He's like, man, I couldn't
handle any other psychedelic drugs.

488
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,200
I'm like,
listen man,

489
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,430
I've done most of them and eating too
much weed is like the most intense shit

490
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:35,310
I've ever done. You know what I
mean? From all over the world.

491
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:38,790
That will fucking get you somewhere.
Yeah, I have to deal with it.

492
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,060
I felt much better after
d and every DMT trip,

493
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,970
every DM t trip I've had has freaked me
out. That taught me a lot about life,

494
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,380
taught me a lot about myself,

495
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,550
given me these weird visions and weird
insights and, but when it's over,

496
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:54,660
I feel good.

497
00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:00,170
I feel like legitimately good when I
feel like I get raped when I do too much

498
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:04,980
weed, like I just get mounted by
a demon and have my face fucked,

499
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,620
just clause in my brain.
And

500
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,510
then you sitting there
taking it. Ooh, knowing,

501
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:18,390
knowing that the end is
without a doubt coming,

502
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,510
whether it's 50 years or
60 years or a hundred year,

503
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,250
however long you think
you're gonna live stupid,

504
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,380
it's common and no one knows what's next.

505
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,800
And your whole life has been running on
this momentum of madness the whole life,

506
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,570
the whole fucking thing right out of the
vagina. Bam, crazy parents, crazy life.

507
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,680
Hong Kong,
beep beep fuck you tonight on the news,

508
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,880
your life madness

509
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,380
and trying to stay afloat.
You know river of fucking crazy people.

510
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Everywhere you go bobbing fucking
crazy maniacs all over television,

511
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,720
all over school.
Every fucking person you date,

512
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,080
every person you stick your
penis inside or they let you,

513
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,430
you stick their penis inside of you.
Whatever it is, they're all fucking crazy.

514
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:07,990
And guess what? Fuck phase. You're crazy
too. You're crazy. We're all crazy.

515
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:11,230
And then you take a little dip
where everything can get quiet

516
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,240
and you have this moment of clarity
where you can reflect back on this crazy

517
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,850
circus you've been in and
really think about it.

518
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:22,870
And then maybe make some
course corrections. Make
some changes pop out of it.

519
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:25,660
That's what's beautiful about it.
Didn't Zen, they call it Satori.

520
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,340
These moments of clarity and
consciousness and a general circus of life

521
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,480
awareness. So the reset button, that's it.

522
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,640
I'd like to do it once a month,
some way or another. Once a month,

523
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,680
hit the reset and a lot, you know, I
have a huge benefit of having that tank.

524
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,460
Having that tank in my basement
is so gigantic. Hell yeah.

525
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,850
Cause if I ever need to
just go on a a wild one,

526
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,360
I just eat a pot brownie again.
That fucking thing.

527
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,920
Space Cheese fries.
Yeah.

528
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,880
I've become molecules in a never ending
fractal universe before I was, uh,

529
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,210
I, I was in, it's one
vision that was so intense.

530
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,930
The problem with these things is they're
so intense, especially by the way,

531
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,370
when I take Alpha brain,
I've got this new way of, uh,

532
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,440
wherever we've always
talked about the dreams.

533
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,530
Like Alpha brain has a really
intense effect on dreams,

534
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,810
but it also seems to have a very intense
effect on the visualizations that I get

535
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,100
when I eat marijuana.

536
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,320
Like I get it more intense
series of things that I see.

537
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,190
Like when you eat it, like when
you close your eyes, not when I'm,

538
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:39,220
my eyes are open. There's no
hallucinogenic effects or at least for me,

539
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,050
but what am I close my eyes.

540
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:46,030
I see things in front of my eyelids
like dancing cartoons that are neon and

541
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,210
they're having sex and breeding and stuff.
I see like weird, crazy shit almost,

542
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,860
you know, like very, very psychedelic.

543
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:57,430
Like if your eyes were open
and you saw those things,
you would think, wow, I'm on,

544
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,650
I'm on something serious
amounts of mushrooms here.

545
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,790
But having your eyes closed and just
envisioning these things like as a dream

546
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,240
somehow I know that they become
less preposterous or less crazy,

547
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,690
but it's very intensely hallucinogenic
and more so it seems when I Take Alpha

548
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:17,140
brain, so the eating of the pot,
which is intensely hallucinogenic,

549
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,370
I mean I've had wild experiences eating
it and just being on a plane and closing

550
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:24,910
my eyes on a plane and seeing just
nutty fucking light shows in front of my

551
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:25,744
eyelids.

552
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,750
But inside the tank it's just cranks it
up to 10 just find some new gear that

553
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:33,280
you didn't know existed.

554
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,380
I think seeing those things to me is a
good sign that you're in that state of

555
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:40,070
presence.
You're in

556
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,330
that state of the nether where you're
just accessing the unconscious realms of

557
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:47,150
the mind. And that's for me, even
when I meditate with nothing,

558
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:48,590
that's what I'm kind of shooting for.

559
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,250
It's if I can close my eyes
and start drifting into other,

560
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:55,700
just following the visions without trying
to direct them or think that's when I

561
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:58,150
know my mind is shut off and
that's what I know. I'm in a good,

562
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:03,170
good place and psychedelics tend to have
that characteristic always with them as

563
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:04,700
well.
And I think it goes hand in hand.

564
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:08,600
It's just that's what happens when the
mind gets quiet and you're just kind of

565
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:12,940
floating around looking at these
images as they appear. Yeah. So thing

566
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,540
that you do when you're in a
normal state of consciousness,

567
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,760
we sort of see almost controlling
and defining your reality by your,

568
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:24,640
your,
your ability to see things clearly.

569
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,500
You know where they are
and you know distances.

570
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,290
You've got everything locked down.
You know where everything is.

571
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,300
You see the people around
you see the objects,

572
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,480
but when you're on a psychedelic
and you're closing your eyes,

573
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,340
or even if you're in like
having meditation, you're
closing your eyes, you, you,

574
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:44,370
your imagination starts to kick in and
you start to see and dream and feel

575
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:50,760
things. They don't have to be there.
The idea that they have to be,

576
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,840
you have to put those on
a scale for them to count.

577
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,290
Like you have to take those
ideas and hit them with a hammer.

578
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,110
Otherwise they're not real. No, they're,
they're, they're real. Like the,

579
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:01,960
the imaginary idea is that you get with
your eyes closed depending on what's

580
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:04,300
causing them,
whether it's meditation and Yoga,

581
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,880
whether you got punched in the
face and you're seeing stars,

582
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,510
whatever the fuck it is that's
causing it there. There's still,

583
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,000
these visions are still real.
You know,

584
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:17,290
you could say their hallucinations
and you'd be correct medically.

585
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,200
But if, say, if I gave you a DMT and I,

586
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:26,260
I told you what I'm going to give you
is a natural psychedelic compound that

587
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:30,190
your own brain produces and all it
really does when I give it to you is it's

588
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:32,140
going to fuck with your cerebral cortex.

589
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,330
Fuck with your visual
interpretations of things.

590
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:36,070
And you're going to see
things all scrambled up.

591
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,890
Like as if like your connectors are
plugged in wrong on your television.

592
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,820
You just can see a bunch of crazy shit.
So don't worry about it.

593
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,680
Doesn't mean anything.
And you come back and you say,

594
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:50,070
I saw God and he told me the nature
of the universe is love and that the

595
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:52,630
universe is actually made of of love.

596
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:55,900
And understanding the suffering only
exists for us to be able to truly

597
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:58,630
appreciate the love and
as human beings evolve,

598
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,200
the suffering and the and
the love will do battle.

599
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,520
And this is literally the good and evil
of the Bible. And this is what, what,

600
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,890
why this has been interpreted
by every major religion.

601
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:10,930
This is this internal
struggle that we all know.

602
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,200
This is a reason why it's so admirable
when someone becomes a good person,

603
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,600
because we know how difficult
it is to always choose the
light. No, no, no, no, no,

604
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,730
no. You were just tripping. No, no,
no, no. You don't understand, man.

605
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,880
We gave you a DMT in your brain fucked up.
Now,

606
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,510
if I gave you a another pill and I said,

607
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,170
this is a pill that was brought to us
by angels and it came in this, this,

608
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:38,190
this beautiful crystal box
and it's directly from God
and it's a door to door to

609
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,830
God's kingdom and you're going to get to
talk to him and hang out with them for

610
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:45,030
15 minutes and you want to do it, you'd
be like, oh my God, it's from God. Yes,

611
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:47,800
it's from God. It's from God. It has
a look. The pill is a cross on it.

612
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,410
Take it so you take it,

613
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,920
you go direct and you have the exact
same experience that I described,

614
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:56,430
the exact same experience as an
experience where the guy told you, oh,

615
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:59,490
just cerebral cortex is
confused and you're just
seeing shit that's not there in

616
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,121
your imagination.

617
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:05,040
Creates got the experience is exactly
the same and that's what people have to

618
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,820
understand. Everybody wants to the
same assholes. I want to bite them.

619
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,970
I just don't work. Well, you don't
need them. You'd know maybe shut up.

620
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,980
It's not what the fuck is going on.

621
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:19,330
This is the exact same reason why there's
this need to dispel any notions that

622
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:25,020
you're having spiritual experience and
to sort of minimize those experiences,

623
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,910
but it's the same experience.

624
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,780
And if you benefit from that experience
to the same extent as you had benefited

625
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:34,800
from a real visit with angels,
then then it's just as good dummy.

626
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,340
This is causing the positive effect
that you could only dream to achieve by

627
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,080
doing that. And it's being
duplicated by science to now,

628
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,890
you know the swings Hopkins study and it's
real. This isn't Mormonism, right? Yeah.

629
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:48,020
This isn't fucking scientists.

630
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,850
Golden tablets like found
in Pennsylvania or whatever.

631
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,020
All you have to do is smoke this
stuff and you fucking travel to other

632
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:59,370
dimensions. Like, I'm not making
it up. You'd say, I'm making it up,

633
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:02,940
but every fucking person that's ever
done it comes back to me and goes,

634
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,290
you weren't even making that up. Nope.
I wasn't even making up crazy. Huh.

635
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,630
Crazy that you're hearing about
that from the fear factor guy.

636
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,890
So I was thinking about opening the
archives. I've never talked about it,

637
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:16,550
but my very first psychedelic experiences
that Kinda got me on this path.

638
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,590
I've told the IOWASCA story,
the bogus story,

639
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:22,730
but this is all after I've been
somewhat through the initiation cycle.

640
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:25,820
So I was thinking of getting into
that and where was it? So this was,

641
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,160
I was like between 18 and 22,

642
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:31,850
so in college and I started my first
one at 18 and I'm going to change the

643
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:33,530
geographic location just a little bit,

644
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:36,270
cause in case she's still rocking
and rolling out there anyway.

645
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,910
So go out to the southwest crossover.
Um,

646
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,030
she picks me up in a land cruiser.
Whatever's got a dog and a car and she is,

647
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:45,890
you know,
kind of that loose showman,

648
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:50,891
but more of like a more of like a
psychiatric kind of medicine giver,

649
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,853
you know,
not really.

650
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,880
Not trained in these ancient arts
are ways and indigenous people.

651
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:58,880
She just kind of knew about the medicine,
had a great heart and,

652
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,320
and so she picks me up and I'm pretty
fucking terrified. I've done nothing.

653
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,790
I smoke weed once with my brothers and
had laugh and we ate like the worst food.

654
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,080
What it means you want to do this?

655
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,640
I was like v I'm very curious by nature.

656
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:18,050
Like I wanted to see what was possibly
get you involved from gay sex and be very

657
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:22,520
careful. Wow. I haven't been curious
about that yet. They'll get, you know,

658
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,710
feel free to curious because
motherfuckers are tricky.

659
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:29,060
They're guys remember that always
you might take guys are God. So yeah.

660
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:30,950
And I was fairly agnostic.

661
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:33,260
I kind of had a sense that
maybe there was something more,

662
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:37,720
but I was more borderline
atheist add, there ain't shit.
You know, you go in a box.

663
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:38,554
All these people are,

664
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,040
cause I knew enough and I know I went to
high school in Texas and they're always

665
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:45,790
trying to get me to these
Christian ministry things
and I'm asking him question.

666
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,190
They're looking at me like,
Huh, you know, I was like,

667
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:51,100
this is a bunch of fucking bullshit.
So I was more on the atheist side.

668
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,070
So I decided, you know, as a
connection through the old, you know,

669
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:56,860
old family friends and I
just decided to go off.

670
00:38:56,861 --> 00:39:00,220
They're kind of like a rite of passage,
so picks me up. I'm nervous as shit.

671
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:01,031
We get to the place,

672
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:04,670
there's some nice little mountains and
hills and we got this like little year

673
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:08,260
that I'm going to stay in a year. It
was a year. Yeah. Built up out there,

674
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:12,520
no power and anything like that. And uh,
so we're going to do it the next day.

675
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,420
She says, okay, goodnight.
You know, here's everything
you need. So I'm up all night.

676
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:20,050
Just nervous as shit cause that you feel
like you're about to jump off a cliff.

677
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:23,230
You have no idea what's going to
go down. And I sometimes, you know,

678
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:26,920
I get a lot of these people sending me
messages and I forget what I was like

679
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:29,670
that very first time cause
it's fucking terrifying now.

680
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:33,700
So I get up early in the morning and I
go for a long walk and I'm just trying to

681
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,630
get my head around this.

682
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:38,620
I'm so afraid that I'm going to
completely lose touch with reality,

683
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,620
that I'm just, and I may never get
back, you know, that's the fear.

684
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:44,740
Like you're going to be so
gone. What's there? What's left?

685
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:48,400
How do you cling to anything? You have no
control, you know? So I'm freaking out.

686
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,050
So on my way back from the hike,

687
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:53,740
I kind of get my head in a good place
and I pick up this rock and it's rather

688
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,080
flat and I still have it to this
day. And I was like, all right,

689
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:58,210
I'm going to hold this
rock through the ceremony.

690
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,480
And if ever I feel like I'm completely
out of touch with the earth,

691
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,450
I'm going to have this rock here and
that's going to let me know that there are

692
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:05,190
rocks.

693
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,830
And one day I'll go back to the world
of the rocks and I'll at least be okay.

694
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,820
So we go and we're about to
start the ceremony. And, um,

695
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,950
my very first ceremony was going to be,

696
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:18,520
and she was very open with what she was
giving me was going to be a combination

697
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:21,400
of mushrooms and Mtma pure mdms.
Whoa,

698
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:23,860
she's candy flipping you
right off the bat off the bat.

699
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,850
So she and we go and we set an intention.

700
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:31,060
He had me write an intention for what
I was going to do and I'm nervous.

701
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,900
I have no idea. So I read my intention
and I'm already like pretty emotional.

702
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:36,460
And then we have a tea,

703
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,610
I drink the tea and I take the pill
and I just kind of wait and my heart's

704
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,600
thumping.
I don't know what's going to happen.

705
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:48,340
And then I think probably the MTMA started
kicking in first and I was like, Ugh,

706
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,320
God damn,
this feels pretty good.

707
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,190
And then then the mushrooms started
really kicking and then the visionary

708
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:57,610
experience started to happen.
And I remember one of my first visions,

709
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,640
I was walking through like a field of
grass and I was just feeling my hands move

710
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:07,660
through the grass. Like I was pushing,
pushing right through the grass.

711
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,950
And then I could feel like my breathing
didn't seem that necessary anymore.

712
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:14,890
And I was almost becoming
disconnected from my breath.

713
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,000
And then I could feel the wind coming
through and all of a sudden the wind just

714
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:20,710
went right through me and I was,

715
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,130
my physical body no longer
existed in that moment.

716
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:27,430
It was almost like I am
sure I still was breathing,

717
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:31,990
but it felt like I absolutely was not
and didn't need to and it didn't matter.

718
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,060
And my spirit was
disconnected from my body.

719
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,830
And at that moment was probably one of
the most defining moments in my life.

720
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,140
Cause I realized,
Holy Shit,

721
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,350
this little meet vehicle that I'm really
attached to is not what I really am.

722
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,460
It's just a car that I'm driving around
and for now and like this other thing

723
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,340
that I'm experiencing and
feeling separate from that body,

724
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,300
that's something different.
And the clarity I had from that moment,

725
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:04,160
from being able to separate from
my body was immense. You know?

726
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:07,710
And I realized at some point,
you know, when you're free of,

727
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,280
when you're free of these
bodily confines and the mind,

728
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,970
you're going to be able to look back at
your life and see everything that you've

729
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:15,380
done,
good or bad.

730
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,220
And if it's good and you've lived well
and you've pushed out as much love and

731
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:21,860
done the best you can,
you're going to be in a heaven,

732
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,830
in a heavenly state at that point.
It's going to be having, you know,

733
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:28,280
you've done your job in this earth, you've
had a great time, you spread the light,

734
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:32,210
spread the love and and done, you know,
done what you were there to do basically.

735
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,830
But if you've lived,
you know,

736
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,150
badly and done harm to people and hurt
people and increase the suffering of the

737
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:39,620
world at that point,

738
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:43,820
the blinders are just ripped off your
eyes and you got to stare dead in the face

739
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:47,300
of all the demons and evil you've
ever done. And that's fucking hell.

740
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:51,440
That's a hell that's worth no worse than
any fire and brimstone cause there's no

741
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:54,620
way to not look. It's like one of those
horror movies where they have you,

742
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,011
you know,

743
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:58,340
your eyes pinned open and you can't not
look at something terrible in front of

744
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:02,180
you except you're looking back at your
own life. And, and I realized that,

745
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:02,901
you know,
all,

746
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:05,640
I had a lot of anger towards Christianity
at that point and I was like,

747
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:09,020
this is all bullshit. I was like, wait a
minute, maybe there is a heaven and hell,

748
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,770
you know, it just doesn't
involve the demons and the
Sugar Candy Mountain and the

749
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:13,520
bullshit.

750
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,090
But it's a point where you're reconnected
with spirit and you get to look back

751
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:19,520
and reflect your life and
nobody else needs a torture.

752
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:22,190
You or pat you on the back,
wish you to the pearly gates.

753
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,960
That's all going to be through yourself.

754
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,740
And that changed the fucking game forever.

755
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,430
Why was that first experience?
First experience,

756
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,090
not just knocks it out of the park.
I was up and that was,

757
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:37,490
that was a really cool night
for me. I was up, you know,

758
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,050
all the stars are there were far,

759
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:43,730
far away from electricity and the
old dog that was in the car was um,

760
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,660
you know, had really bad hips and they
had a main, the main kind of house,

761
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:51,050
Little Casa that was way warmer
that a bunch of fires and things.

762
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:55,040
There's nice and cozy out in the year. It
was, you know, much more kind of rural,

763
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:58,250
not much, not much going. They've
got a really blanket up and uh,

764
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,380
I was pretty vulnerable at that point.

765
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:04,420
I was out of my body or whatever and the
coyote start coming in at the night and

766
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,610
I remember that the old dog just
stayed right outside my door.

767
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,690
Never spent the night outside cause it's
old arthritic dog and just stayed out

768
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,830
there awake all night with me.
You know,

769
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,930
as I was kind of going through this stuff
and it was just kind of a cool kinship.

770
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:21,800
I felt probably one of the first times
I felt like a real kinship with another

771
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,640
species, like a different animal
that she was high as fuck.

772
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:30,300
Cling into reality.
He had a rock and a dog man.

773
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,930
And I was just on a fucking mission.
And so I went back,

774
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,100
I went back to her and did the same
thing, you know, meet her in the airport,

775
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:41,310
go drive across the border and then,
and then go to these journeys.

776
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,780
I did several different other, you know,
interesting things from that point. Uh,

777
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:49,020
I snuffed,
I snuffed five Meo DMT,

778
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:54,180
which was a fucking wild experience.
Snuffed it down in Mexico. Yup.

779
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,040
Snuffed it.
So they created,

780
00:44:56,041 --> 00:45:00,000
I think it was a snuff from the bufo
toxin in some kind of traditional way. Uh,

781
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,620
I'm hoping they harvested it, you know,
friendly from the frog or whatever,

782
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,030
but they created a snuff and you know,

783
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,340
pretty much there was this like
caterpillar looking at amount of powder.

784
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:16,080
It was like Ruddy Brown. And um,
that was, this was my second,

785
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:18,360
this is my second journey.
Second time down to see her.

786
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,230
And I guess I had some kind of
straw or something. I was snorting,

787
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:27,231
it wasn't a rolled up Hundo it was like
some kind of Straw or old kind of seed

788
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:32,550
tube. And, um, and so I snuffed it.
And how was my first DMT experience?

789
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,270
But of course, as you know, five
Meo DMT is a much different animal.

790
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,790
It's even stronger. Yeah, it was,

791
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,140
it was a really incredibly
personal experience.

792
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:47,490
So in that experience, I went back
and relived, I had a great child,

793
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:48,360
I have no complaints,

794
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:52,140
but my dad had a pretty savage temper
and it would just build up and he would

795
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:56,820
get really intimidating and start yelling
at me. And I, I guess I built up some,

796
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,850
some issues about that, you know,
it's probably most kids would,

797
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:03,600
I was pretty young when this would happen
and it fucking put me right back in

798
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:07,530
the room with one of these most intense
experiences and I was reliving it and my

799
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:11,460
dad was in the same place just
yelling at me like, blah, blah.

800
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,140
And all of a sudden I is that little
kid like became the man that I was,

801
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:18,030
I was 1920 and I was like,

802
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,500
you're gonna fucking yell at me
like that now I am. Look at me now.

803
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:24,210
You want to do that shit to me now?

804
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,920
And it was turning this fear that I
had had into like this standing up for

805
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:31,710
myself and rage like I fucking dare you.

806
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:35,580
So you went as an adult almost in
relive the six completely relived it.

807
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:38,040
But with the strength that I had
accumulated as an adult, you know,

808
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:42,960
I was doing kickboxing and I was lifting
weights and you know, I was pretty,

809
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,330
pretty athletic at that point,
more so than my father.

810
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,720
And at that point I
just relived it as this,

811
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,220
don't you fucking dare do that to
me? I will. And, and there was shit,

812
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,200
it was really heavy.
Right.

813
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:58,410
And I was in that fucking
space the whole time.

814
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:01,740
Like it wasn't like I was
imagining it that was happening.

815
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:05,510
Like I was in the room and there was
tears. And then ultimately, you know,

816
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,780
ultimately a US kind of forgiveness, you
know, where in my vision he was like,

817
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:14,430
I'm so sorry. You know, it's
like, I understand. And I was
like, okay. And we kind of,

818
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,410
my relationship with him since then,

819
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:20,670
for the 12 years after was
that like fixed a huge,

820
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,920
huge divide between us.

821
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,910
You know where I could say I'm a man now
and I'm not scared of you. No matter,

822
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,010
no matter what you try to do,
you know,

823
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,680
and I kind of reversed this thing
that had me a little fearful.

824
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:37,600
It had me feeling not like a man myself
I guess because I got kind of dominated

825
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:39,580
in a way by my father figure.

826
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,180
And that was kind of the real
coming of age experience for me.

827
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,340
There was a guy at the park the other day,

828
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,130
I was with my,
my kids when we were playing around.

829
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:52,420
Some guys playing with his kid
seems real friendly and he says, uh,

830
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,430
hey man, uh, he's gonna you're going to
be raising his hand someday about his son.

831
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,550
Like meaning that his son is going to
be an MMA fighter and I almost want to

832
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:03,100
tell him like,
not if you do a good job at wall.

833
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,610
I mean it sounds fucked up,

834
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:11,170
but I mean there's a few guys who had
a real good parents like George Saint

835
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,470
Pierre or John Jones still his parents
come to every fight. And, I mean,

836
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:15,041
I obviously,

837
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,320
I don't know what the relationship
that they had with their parents was,

838
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:20,560
but there's a large percentage,

839
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:25,240
a very large percentage of fighters
who were beaten up and fucked with as a

840
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:28,570
young kid and not just bullied by,
by their kids at school,

841
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:32,080
but beaten by their parents. You
know, child abuse. I mean there's,

842
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:36,460
there's a ton of them. Yeah. Um, there's
a guy who was arrested yesterday,

843
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,150
Tiago Silva. Did you hear this
story standoff with police?

844
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:45,130
I didn't dig deep armed standoff
with the police in Miami. A parent,

845
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,270
I don't know the whole story,
but apparently involved a woman and a,

846
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,520
I don't know what the fuck happened.
It might have involved drugs.

847
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,450
There's a bunch of different
versions of it. Obviously the dude,

848
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,240
it was a crazy person.
Whatever happened,

849
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:02,230
there was allegedly some guns
and allegedly some fucking,

850
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,410
he's a murderer. It meaning
they're in the cage. I mean,

851
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:08,920
Taco Silva is a scary motherfucker.
Fuck yeah. He comes after dudes.

852
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:12,340
He's imagine that guy
with no referee in a gun.

853
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,720
Holy Jesus Christ. You know, I
don't know what happened. So eat,

854
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:21,340
but there's a story that someone put
today on the underground about Tiago

855
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,060
Silva's childhood. Uh, the underground
being mixed martial arts.com,

856
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,110
which is one of my favorite,

857
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,320
well my number one favorite website
when it comes to what MMA. Just a,

858
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:34,360
an awesome forum.
Always has great up to date news.

859
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:37,590
And I know the guys who run it in
a very, very cool guys, but the,

860
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:41,140
the actual story of him growing up,

861
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:45,700
his childhood was fucking horrific.
Horrific to read.

862
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:46,630
I had to stop reading it.

863
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,520
It's talking about his dad just regularly
beating the fucking shit out of him

864
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,540
and he has a big scar on his head from
when he was a little boy was dad fucking

865
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:59,050
opened him up. I mean,
terrifying, terrifying shit.

866
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,650
That's how you make a really scary guy.
Like Thiago Silva.

867
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,320
He make a guy who doesn't want
to fucking take it anymore.

868
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:07,600
He's tired of it and he learns
how to stand up for himself.

869
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:11,230
But along the way sometimes,
you know,

870
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:15,040
you can make a fucking monster can,
you can make a monster with abuse.

871
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,020
Yeah, no doubt. It has,
it affected me, my,

872
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:21,480
one of my best friends is Roger Huerta
and it's no, it's no secret his, you know,

873
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:25,770
he was abused by pretty much
all the female figures in
his life. Pretty savagely.

874
00:50:25,771 --> 00:50:29,510
Yeah. And you know, it's, it certainly
can contribute. And then there's,

875
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:34,380
there are those people who are just meant
to be the Samurai of the way, you know,

876
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:39,260
the Musashi types where it just
suits them. So it's either either or,

877
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:44,261
you have to have this deep calling from
some archetypal draw to that or there

878
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:48,680
has to be something that kind of
deflects you in a, in a weird way.

879
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,010
And I wonder if I hadn't done all
these different things, you know,

880
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:56,030
mine wasn't that severe. As I said, I had
a great fucking child. I'm very blessed.

881
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,970
Um,
but I wonder if I wouldn't have wanted to,

882
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,050
cause I was on the borderline for doing
some fighting and things like that.

883
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:08,050
If I hadn't gotten that out and really
felt like I could assert myself fully as,

884
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,550
as a man then in that rite of passage,

885
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,490
maybe I would've sought it in
the cage somehow. You know,

886
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:17,450
maybe that would have had to fulfill
that role for even me. You know,

887
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:20,540
you never know like where obviously
I was never destined to be a fucking

888
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:24,640
champion, but maybe I'd have gone
into some smokers or something, but,

889
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,530
but you know,
it's,

890
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:29,990
it's interesting and the effects that
that can have and really doing the heavy

891
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:33,890
work, doing the heavy lifting,
that sitting there talking
on a couch to somebody,

892
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,570
you know,
you're not going to get there.

893
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,630
You aren't going to see
it happening and rewrite,

894
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,640
reprogram the history in your brain.
So when I look at that back now,

895
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:48,160
it's not like poor me. It's, it's,
I'm sorry my dad had to, you know,

896
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,410
inflict that, that's going to be
hurting him, but I'm not affected.

897
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:55,190
I'm not scared by that anymore.
I overcame that from, you know,

898
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:58,250
from the help of this,
this medicine. Yeah. The,

899
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,450
the feelings that I had when
I was in high school was,

900
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,650
the big one was I moved around a lot.
And, uh, when I was in high school,

901
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:08,740
I didn't really get picked on. I went to
a really good school. It's a nice place.

902
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,390
I mean everybody gets
bullied a little bit.

903
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:13,660
You get fucked with by people
a little bit. But um, my,

904
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,690
my zest for fighting was almost all
entirely based on my childhood is based on

905
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:22,210
trying to overcome any feelings of,

906
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:25,660
of weakness or vulnerability
that I had when I was younger.

907
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,510
So as I got less and less vulnerable,

908
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,110
it's my desire to fight
got less and less to,

909
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:36,400
it was really fascinating to
especially experience in retrospect.

910
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,350
Look back on it like,
um,

911
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,010
once I was out of the house and I
wasn't living with my mom and my stepdad

912
00:52:42,011 --> 00:52:46,540
anymore and it was on my own and just
live in like I have almost a zero

913
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:50,230
aggression. It was weird. It was
like I wasn't in school anymore.

914
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:52,060
I didn't know what he was
telling me what to do anymore.

915
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:56,290
I didn't have this feeling like I was
going to be this a utter complete failure

916
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:59,830
because I couldn't get through school
without falling asleep, so fucking bored.

917
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,290
But as I got like 19, 20, 21,

918
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:05,950
then it became about
this intense challenge.

919
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,760
Then it became a much more
healthy appreciation for
competition because when I

920
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:14,200
was 16 I just wanted to fuck people up
and I met my parents actually didn't want

921
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:17,770
me to do martial arts because they were
terrified that I was going to become

922
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:20,230
this angry kid who knew
how to fuck people up.

923
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,940
Whereas before it was just angry kid who
really couldn't do anything. It wasn't,

924
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,040
wasn't dangerous. I was, you know, and

925
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,670
then this 11 year old became 12
and the 12 year olds like, ah,

926
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:31,110
I want to be like Bruce Lee. You
know, like under the fuck you. No,

927
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:35,250
I don't think so. You know, didn't want
me having, didn't chucks. I had noon.

928
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:37,560
Chuck's all the time.
People are just taking shit away from me.

929
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,340
I'd make them in the woodshop.
I tell him that I was making a chair legs,

930
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,410
fucking my chair's grab two broken legs.

931
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,720
Funny that they look exactly like
nunchucks. Mr Jason, who's the,

932
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:52,410
every kid loved nunchucks.
Everybody did.

933
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:54,990
Of course the Bruce Lee
movies, man, there were dope.

934
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,250
Let me see him swinging around. I had a
really funny story that happened there.

935
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:01,680
So there was a kid,
I was like seven and there was a kid,

936
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:04,660
neighbor kid who was like
12 and he was big, you know,

937
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,800
way bigger than me and he would kind of
pick on me a little bit just because he

938
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:08,190
was bigger.

939
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,590
But I had a bunch of older brothers so
they would always keep them in line or

940
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:11,340
whatever.

941
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:16,220
One day he did something fucked up to me
and again at seven versus 12 so they're

942
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,180
like, Nah, we got a plan.
And I had, you know,

943
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:20,610
those foam nunchucks that you could
get and they're like playing around.

944
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:22,350
They had a hard center
and foam on the outside.

945
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:26,400
So I had those hidden behind my back and
my brother was holding me back and he

946
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:29,580
says, Ryan, go take your
shots man. I'm fucking sick.

947
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:32,550
I was Chris and I'm sick of Chris
is bullshit. Go take your shots.

948
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:33,600
And meanwhile he's holding me,

949
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:36,360
Lucy and I just have these
nunchucks and this guy's like, yeah,

950
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:37,740
I'm going to get him an cheap shots.

951
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,310
It goes up to punch me in the stomach
and I just whip them out like fucking

952
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:41,820
Bruce Lee.

953
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,870
And just go ape shit on this 12 year
old kid and I remember I was like,

954
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,240
I am fucking Bruce Lee's.
Oh yeah,

955
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:53,170
I could let him up up. They
were hitting him. They,

956
00:54:53,171 --> 00:54:56,720
it was like a fucking swarm of bees.
He just ran into funny.

957
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:01,680
What a dumb ass. Yeah, I'm holding
my brother back. Come Punch him.

958
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:06,420
Yeah. I'm an asshole. Believes that
the kid deserves it. He deserves it.

959
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:09,930
Just that's a lesson the universe
taught him. What are you fucking stupid?

960
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,110
It's not going to hold his brother
and let him let you punch him.

961
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:18,710
Silly Bitch is Bruce Lee with the nun
chucks and that video will go that

962
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,610
it was fucking people
up with new and trex.

963
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,880
Bruce Lee was the inventor
of the retard wagon train.

964
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,880
It's like one guy stands in the
center and they all take turns,

965
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,720
which fucking never happens in
the real world by the way folks.

966
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,270
They come at you a mass of bodies.

967
00:55:36,271 --> 00:55:41,271
You get Paul centrally located and that
one person grabs you and you maybe get

968
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:44,340
to punch one or two as they drag it to
the ground and break everything on your

969
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:48,100
body, stop you in new order.
Fucking apple sauce pub.

970
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:51,570
There's a lot of myths that I think
came up from those martial arts.

971
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,150
I started watching a little bit of that
UFC documentary, that 20 years thing.

972
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,390
That was kind of cool. This is an
intense, it's fucking almost cried.

973
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:05,040
I was never thought about what happened.
That was pretty powerful. Yeah.

974
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:06,420
When we're sitting in talking about it,

975
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:09,960
and I was talking about how long
I've been doing this and it's weird.

976
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,750
Yeah. 20 fucking years and long ass
time. But meanwhile, in 20 years,

977
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,870
the 20 years of the UFC has
been around 21. Now the world,

978
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,710
the world of martial arts has evolved more
than it hasn't for thousands of years.

979
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:24,010
Yup. Thousands. Like

980
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,960
people know exactly what
works now. I mean, there's a
few weird as me, Oh, so cute.

981
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,160
There's a few, um, like, um,

982
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,330
techniques that are just starting
to creep in. There's a few, uh,

983
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,210
like taekwondo techniques, like
you rarely, rarely see acts kicks,

984
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:43,780
but occasionally someone will throw
an ax kick. Uh, this guy, Ama, God,

985
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:47,100
this guy has been fight in
the UFC I guess is back.

986
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:49,930
I must've been in taekwondo work,
some karate or something,

987
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:53,500
but he throws a bunch of fucking wild
kicks and spinning three 60 round kicks

988
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:56,050
and shit like that. And he does,
he knocked guy with a three 60,

989
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:59,410
we'll kick wants a in a fight.
It just, what makes those viable,

990
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:04,180
it seems to me is you have to be good
enough at everything else before you can

991
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:07,320
attempt that. If you just come in there
and that's what you got and your toolkit,

992
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,990
you gonna get taken down. Yeah, you're
going to get drug into fucking bad places.

993
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:13,860
You got to have a good ground game
and you've got to have a good takedown

994
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,350
defense. If you don't have a good takedown
defense, you got to have a good guard.

995
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,580
It's one of the Donald Cerrone, so good
[inaudible] he's like a, an expert kicker,

996
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:25,300
but he also has a wicked guard. Like
if you'd take him down like he fucked,

997
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,650
haven't done them up.
When they went to the ground,

998
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,860
he caught him in a triangle and
just locked it up tight. Yeah,

999
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,560
he's triangles nasty and he likes
fighting. You know, those are those,

1000
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:34,210
that's another good component to Donald's.

1001
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:39,160
Roney but that head kick now kicked that
guy in the neck. Oh my God. Beautiful.

1002
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,980
Beautiful Shin to the neck.
Yeah.

1003
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:45,220
Adriano Martine's he fucking caught
them shin to the neck. Ernesto.

1004
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:50,020
Whose style do you just shut off,
man? You Shit just shuts off. Yeah,

1005
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:53,920
that's a, that's what he did. It was
beautiful. That Shinder the neck, man.

1006
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:57,370
It's one of my favorite all
time techniques. Mari Smith,

1007
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,490
who's a good buddy of mine, he, uh,

1008
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,810
he landed that was like one of the
first head kicks in MMA. He, uh,

1009
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:09,600
he landed on Conan Sylvia era back
in the extreme fighting. You hit him.

1010
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,550
Pretty sure he's shunned them in the neck,
but uh,

1011
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:16,090
that Shin to the neck technique,
man, it's a crazy thing that happens.

1012
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:18,460
Your shit shouts off. Game over. Yeah.

1013
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:23,260
That nerve just gets fucking bull lasted.
Here's Serone and Martine's.

1014
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,400
This dude fucked. Oh, look at that.
I mean that is just picture perfect.

1015
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:28,743
That is like,

1016
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:33,910
that is exactly how the technique is
supposed to be thrown and exactly how it's

1017
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:37,300
supposed to land and exactly what
happens when you get hit like that.

1018
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,980
You just at night night. Donald
was cool too about that. He didn't,

1019
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,030
didn't try to throw another one in there.
Yeah,

1020
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:46,270
he could have easily uncorked
that punch. He's very aware. Well,

1021
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:49,090
he's so aware also because
he fight so often. I mean,

1022
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:52,840
he fought four times last year and
you know when you fight that much,

1023
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,310
you're much more present.

1024
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,210
That's the thing about fighting is
the more often you get in fights,

1025
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,670
the more relaxed you'll get
when you're actually fighting,

1026
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,140
the more you could fight
up to your ability.

1027
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:07,120
That's why a big layoff when people talk
about ring rust is not just like when

1028
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:10,500
they talk about what it, what is ring
rust, what is octagon rust, whatever it,

1029
00:59:10,501 --> 00:59:11,440
what is it?
Well,

1030
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:14,140
what it is is you've got to get
comfortable with that crazy experience.

1031
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,690
You've got to have that
experience really close to you.

1032
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:20,110
I go like one of my
best fights ever was a,

1033
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:22,400
I won this a US Open Tournament

1034
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,970
and I are, I want it because
I had fought the week before.

1035
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,540
I fought in a tournament the week before
and I injured my groin and I thought I

1036
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:30,950
was done for like,
I was like,

1037
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:34,580
I can't compete in this New Hampshire
tournament because I'm just too fucked up.

1038
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:37,820
Like my, my groin is really
fucked up. But Saturday morning,

1039
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:38,720
the day of the tournament,

1040
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:41,840
I always got up early cause I delivered
newspapers and I was delivering

1041
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:43,910
newspapers like five o'clock
in the morning and I was like,

1042
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,700
I'm going to fucking fight.
Like I feel good.

1043
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,950
I was really a caffeine and sugar buzz
that made me fight because I ate a bunch

1044
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:54,860
of donuts.
I had fucking terrible diet back then,

1045
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,590
but I ate a bunch of,
I burned off so many calories.

1046
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:59,870
I had like four and a half percent
body fat, like no bullshit,

1047
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,430
four and a half percent body fat.
And I was competing and um, I um,

1048
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,740
I ate a couple of doughnuts and
drank a couple of dump of cup.

1049
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,510
I drank a full cup of a Dunkin
donuts coffee and these two donuts,

1050
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:12,290
I'll never forget it.

1051
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,650
It was a Boston cream donut and
one of those lemon cream ones,

1052
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,360
lemon custard ones where it's covered
in white powdered sugar filled donut.

1053
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,730
You know,
I was reliant on sugar and I was like,

1054
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,130
I'm going to go to New Hampshire
and fuck some people up.

1055
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,170
But the reason why I fought so good,

1056
01:00:27,171 --> 01:00:31,040
I'm pretty sure it was that I had just
fought seven days ago. So it's like that,

1057
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,810
that experience was
still fresh in my mind.

1058
01:00:32,811 --> 01:00:35,840
I just gotten through a whole
tournament seven days ago and one,

1059
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:39,770
so I was like going to this tournament,
I was like so used to fighting. It was,

1060
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,540
it was like,
it was last week's activity and he,

1061
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:45,070
we're going to do it again this
week, you know? But when I,

1062
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,720
one time I tore a muscle and
I had to take a long time off.

1063
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:50,780
I didn't fight for like six months.
That was the longest probably ever.

1064
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,710
And I remember when going back
to fight again, I was like,

1065
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,980
do don't even know what the
fuck I'm doing. And like,

1066
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:57,890
am I gonna freeze up out here? Like
this is, this is kind of scary. Well,

1067
01:00:57,891 --> 01:00:59,380
the mind gets engaged in me.

1068
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,530
That's exactly what you don't want care
if that takes you out of the present

1069
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,950
moment, you know? I think that's the key
for all of these. All of these sports,

1070
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:08,570
any fucking sport,
you know,

1071
01:01:08,571 --> 01:01:13,370
you just got gotta release the mind and
the thinking about pass, pass things,

1072
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:14,990
future things.
You have your game plan,

1073
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:19,370
you know that going in and then just
let it go. That's one aspect of it.

1074
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:20,090
But there's,

1075
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:23,600
the other aspect is technique and
skill and endurance and training and

1076
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:24,920
disciplines.
If you don't have that,

1077
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,080
they're equally important
because you could be,

1078
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:31,280
you could think you're a bad motherfucker
and be like totally in the zone and

1079
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:33,740
completely neutral in Zen.
But if you're a white belt,

1080
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,130
Marcella Garcia is going to fucking
strangle you. Okay? It doesn't matter.

1081
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,940
It doesn't matter what's going
through your head. Oh, you know, dude,

1082
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:43,330
I'm different than other
people. I'm in the zone. I'm,

1083
01:01:43,331 --> 01:01:46,400
I'm completely tuned the
best of your ability,

1084
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:50,930
but that may not cover the
distance between the worst
of someone else's ability.

1085
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,350
And you could catch someone
thinking about, you know,

1086
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,180
a girl that just cheated on him
and now I'm fucked in the head.

1087
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,900
It's going to be so angry with,

1088
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,240
while playing at the worst of
his ability to still smoke,

1089
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,440
only so much you could do [inaudible]
still going to break your arm.

1090
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:05,780
Heidrick gracefully is still
gonna choke you. It asleep.

1091
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:08,990
It's just you're not good enough.
You have to be good enough.

1092
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,190
And those other things,

1093
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,110
which is one of the things
that's so beautiful about
MMA or about Jujitsu or any

1094
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:19,830
martial arts, kickboxing is
it's so hard to get really good.

1095
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,680
It's so hard.
There's so many things involved.

1096
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:27,860
It has to be a list of things have to be
in order for you to win championships.

1097
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,610
If you, you know, if you
get to be a UFC champion,

1098
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:35,880
you get to be a Chris Weidman,
you get to be a Jon Jones.

1099
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,870
So many things have to be in order
for you to get to be that good,

1100
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,980
your mind,
your body life experiences,

1101
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:48,440
the will to win the discipline is show
up at the gym, the intelligence night,

1102
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:50,460
eat shitty food. All these, fuck,

1103
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,790
I told you about winning the u s open
after you told us drinking coffee.

1104
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,950
I was young, I was 19 or 20 I was, yeah,

1105
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,260
you get away with a lot when you're
not really young, but the, the,

1106
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:05,520
the list of things that have to be in
perfect order for you to become great and

1107
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,354
anything.

1108
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:11,650
That's why it's so fun to pursue
greatness or so enriching to pursue it.

1109
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:14,400
And even if it's just personal
greatness, you know, it doesn't,

1110
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,980
you don't have to be the greatest
in the world at anything,

1111
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:20,850
but if you personally
improve at something,

1112
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,540
whether it's fucking
playing tennis or anything,

1113
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,870
but there was a writing books as humans

1114
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,340
prove we were talking about
it right before this podcast.

1115
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,550
It doesn't matter what master you meet,
it can be a master of anything.

1116
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,390
We were using the context of this
bow hunter, Cameron Hanes. Yeah,

1117
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,530
they're just awesome.
To be around.

1118
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,230
I don't give a fuck cause I'm
meeting a ton of them with on it now.

1119
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:44,220
It's one of the great things that I love
about it is these excellent people are

1120
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:45,630
coming out of the woodwork saying,
Hey,

1121
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:48,480
I was fucking excellent and I know
what's good and I like your stuff.

1122
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:50,970
It's awesome. It makes me even
better and that's awesome for me.

1123
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:54,600
But what's even better is spending
time with these people. And it's been,

1124
01:03:54,601 --> 01:03:56,940
it's such a divergent of mount of skills,

1125
01:03:56,941 --> 01:04:00,990
but it's all really the same person
deep down. Just applying that,

1126
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,000
that methodology, you know,
as your favorite quote is,
you know, no the way broadly,

1127
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:08,730
and you'll see it in all things.
It doesn't matter what your art is,

1128
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:12,120
but it gets you to a place where you're
a fucking cool person to hang around

1129
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:12,430
with.

1130
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:16,690
Yeah. All those dudes are the same guy.
They're the same guy in different forms,

1131
01:04:16,691 --> 01:04:19,180
the same girl,
the same woman in different forms.

1132
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:24,220
It's people that figure out how to get
through this crazy maze of life and uh,

1133
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:28,600
come out with something and they're
real. There's this, the real masters.

1134
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:31,990
There's a real confidence,
then there's something to them.

1135
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,240
There's this does present energy.
They're not bullshitting you there.

1136
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,880
They're just there, you know,
just, just fucking there. You know?

1137
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,210
And this Cameron Hanes guy was totally
like that and it's cool as fuck.

1138
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,420
Yeah. Yeah. You've gone
to the edge of the,

1139
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,430
of your own darkness because you have to,

1140
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:51,360
you have to go past that to be really
excellent because you have to work your

1141
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:53,340
way through it and you have
that constant resistance.

1142
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,000
Resistance is always coming
up and pushing. You know,

1143
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,920
as Steven Pressfield
said when we were here,

1144
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:02,970
anytime you go from the lower to the
higher resistance is going and the journey

1145
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:06,930
to mastery is, that's all it is,
is a journey from lower to higher.

1146
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:11,520
So every fucking plateau you're battling
resistance and having to overcome it to

1147
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:12,900
transcend to the next plateau.

1148
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,650
So that skill level and being able to do
that applies to the rest of your life.

1149
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:20,380
And it doesn't matter if
it's a retired 70 year old,

1150
01:05:20,381 --> 01:05:22,230
used to be a master at something,

1151
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,000
they still have that fucking
quality inside of him.

1152
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:29,620
Yeah. And I'm going to read this
email that Cameron sent me today. Uh,

1153
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,780
someone sent him,

1154
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:34,320
I won't reveal the guy's name cause
I'm sure he wanted it private,

1155
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,050
but he said that, watch you on the
Joe Rogan experience. You're a,

1156
01:05:37,051 --> 01:05:38,250
you're an inspiration.

1157
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:41,640
Seeing your approach and philosophy
checks off so many boxes with me.

1158
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,000
Seeing someone work hard at something
meaningful to them is wonderful.

1159
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,540
Even if I never hunt the idea
that I can say, you know what,

1160
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:51,480
I want to push this area of
my life to the next level.

1161
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:55,080
Can I be in better shape for
this or better mental condition?

1162
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:59,250
And that this doesn't have to apply to
things like winning the Olympic gold,

1163
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:03,780
but just to be better at surfing or
hunting, juggling, it doesn't matter.

1164
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:07,290
And he said, thanks man. I liked
that he got an email. Yeah. It got,

1165
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,120
he got that inspiration.
He got that charge. Yup.

1166
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:13,320
And that's what I was saying to Cameron
on the podcast yesterday is that I got

1167
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:18,200
that from him. I got that from watching
his videos. I got, first of all, um,

1168
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,740
his positivity,

1169
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:24,420
he's like this really smiley friendly
guy who does like really nice things.

1170
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:28,740
Like he auctioned off his bow and gave
the money to some guy who was battling

1171
01:06:28,741 --> 01:06:32,670
cancer and you know,
made this really thankful video about it.

1172
01:06:32,671 --> 01:06:34,020
Like his energy is pure.

1173
01:06:34,021 --> 01:06:38,340
Like you can see it when he's
communicating and he's a fucking fiend.

1174
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,670
The guys workout maniac, he's, the
guy's an animal, he's a savage,

1175
01:06:41,671 --> 01:06:44,880
he's out there fucking shooting pointy
sticks at elk and when you're hanging out

1176
01:06:44,881 --> 01:06:47,910
with them, couldn't be cooler.
So it's like the, you, you,

1177
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:52,230
when you were around enough
of those people, you start
absorbing a higher ideal.

1178
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,730
And I think that we oftentimes we
imitate the people that were around.

1179
01:06:56,731 --> 01:06:58,710
We imitate our atmosphere
to a certain extent,

1180
01:06:58,711 --> 01:07:03,060
or at very least it sets a watermark.
And, but you meet people like this,

1181
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:07,020
Cameron Hanes guy or hundreds of other
people that have had on this podcast,

1182
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:11,280
it sets a higher watermark.
It gives you more to aspire.

1183
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:15,900
I agree completely. I, you know, I made a
post on my Facebook page that, you know,

1184
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:19,770
I said something like a encouraging,
that same thing, you know, changing,

1185
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,740
changing your friends, deciding
who you want to hang out with and,

1186
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:27,000
and trying to hang out with these people
that really inspire you and you know,

1187
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,270
so then there was this backlash of
people saying, you know, some people say,

1188
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:32,790
no man,
you're perfect just the way you are.

1189
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:36,390
You shouldn't try to be anything
different. And I was like, well,

1190
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:39,480
I kind of get what you're saying,
but to,

1191
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:43,560
on order to hang out with other people
that inspire you, you can't just be like,

1192
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,780
I am what I am, Bro. I'm
not going to fucking try it.

1193
01:07:45,781 --> 01:07:49,140
And you gotta be in the same path,
you know, to connect with them,

1194
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:51,750
to really be someone that
they want to hang out with.

1195
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:54,030
You gotta be pushing yourself to,
and that's,

1196
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:56,750
that's part of the process because
they're going to see that, you know,

1197
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,530
if you haven't gone out and actively
faced your own demons, that'll be nice.

1198
01:08:01,531 --> 01:08:02,790
That'll shake your hand and whatever,

1199
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:06,900
but they're not calling you out for
beers in a game of pool on Saturday.

1200
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:07,141
You know,

1201
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:11,220
they got other people that inspire them
that they want to be around and make

1202
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:15,250
them feel alive from that same kind of
energy and connection. And you know,

1203
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,940
I think it's, it's
important. Yes. You know,

1204
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:20,150
some parts of us are perfect as they are,
but nonetheless,

1205
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,620
that pursuit of excellence is going to
put you in the class with other people

1206
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:27,740
who were on the same pursuit.
You know, water finds its level.

1207
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:31,610
Yeah. It's an old expression game
recognizes game. Yep. That's, it does.

1208
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,850
People who are real, they, you know,
I don't like using that expression.

1209
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:38,570
People who are real because there's
so many fucking abuses of that word.

1210
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:43,090
Real keeping it real, keeping it real. Um,

1211
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:44,990
but those people that are present,

1212
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:49,991
people that are legitimately who they
are projecting their not putting on an

1213
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:53,870
act. When you meet someone who is
putting on an act, God, it's glaring.

1214
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:57,140
It's a sore thumb. It's
just throb, throb, throb.

1215
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:02,450
Just do shyness and Gross Nis and kept
me away from this fucking idiot and just

1216
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:06,830
catching a little lie here and
they're catching a little, you know,

1217
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:10,790
just a little exaggeration, a
little distortion, a little song.

1218
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:15,280
That shit is bad for you. It's bad for
you to be around. You can catch that.

1219
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:18,410
Just like and catch a cold. You
know, you can catch distortion,

1220
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,230
lower your standards.
It'll slowly chip away.

1221
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:25,940
If you lived in prison and you were
surrounded by liars and thieves and

1222
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:29,240
murderers, like you were in the worst
prison ever. Everyone was guilty.

1223
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:32,180
No one was set up. No one had a
bad childhood. It's just content.

1224
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,510
Just the prison con, con
penitentiary. You know,

1225
01:09:35,511 --> 01:09:38,660
your idea of what human
beings are would drop.

1226
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,140
Well, it happens. The cops
all the time, you know,

1227
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:44,470
cops are dealing with the worst
of humanity on a regular basis.

1228
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:47,260
So they sometimes suspect,

1229
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:49,770
and I say this because my Stepdad was
on the swat team and he was a cop.

1230
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:50,623
It was a kimono.

1231
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:55,960
And so they see the worst in people so
often that it taints their glasses are a

1232
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:58,120
little ruddy black.
You know,

1233
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:01,480
I mean they're seeing the worst in
everybody just cause that's what they're

1234
01:10:01,481 --> 01:10:02,314
conditioned to do.

1235
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,810
Yeah. They also have some
of the best sense of humor.

1236
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,190
I have some friends that are cops,

1237
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:09,770
cops know that I know from a martial
arts or whatever and the order of deals,

1238
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,970
this dark sense of humor man.
Cause they just see, you know,

1239
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:15,870
oh we showed up and this lady's head
was in the middle of the road and yeah.

1240
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,223
Oh Jesus,

1241
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:21,190
what else do you do? But you have
to be able to blow off and laugh and

1242
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,360
yeah.
And then keep it light.

1243
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,080
Be Really Weird about it because you know
when you see something like a horrible

1244
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:29,960
car accident and you see them every day
over and over again and then you get in

1245
01:10:29,961 --> 01:10:34,850
your car, okay here we go. No I'm
going to enter into this thing.

1246
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:36,850
That also is shit.
You know,

1247
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:40,040
I saw what happens when everything
goes wrong earlier today,

1248
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:42,980
but now I'm just going to go about my,
I mean they, and they see it every day.

1249
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,620
I mean every, most likely, you know,

1250
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:50,090
most days they're going to see something
fucked up. Especially if you're in La,

1251
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,430
you know, if you're a
cop in La, Jesus Christ,

1252
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,800
what the fuck did those
guys see every day?

1253
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:58,220
That's why I kind of,
from the cops that I've interacted with,

1254
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:01,100
the more heavy shit that
goes on in the neighborhood,

1255
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,700
usually the cooler the cop is when they
pull you over for something stupid.

1256
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,080
You know,
it's like the cop,

1257
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:09,470
if you get caught in a really neighborhood
but not shit happens and you're going

1258
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:13,260
five miles over the speed
and then there'll be a deck,
a lot of time, you know,

1259
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:13,980
if you're in a place

1260
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,850
where they're checking on murders and
risking their life and whatever, I'm like,

1261
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:21,390
oh cool, you turn the Dome light on and
you're giving me your stuff. All right,

1262
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:23,730
cool man. Uh, just slow down, you know,

1263
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,750
just got to keep it safe out here
and they'll let you off, you know?

1264
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,530
Whereas the other cops are just like,
oh,

1265
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:32,550
look at you because they're
fucking calibration is off.
Obviously generalization,

1266
01:11:32,551 --> 01:11:36,210
but I tend to see that it's
hard to be a cop man really is.

1267
01:11:36,211 --> 01:11:39,830
And people get mad at me on this podcast
for defining defending cops. You know,

1268
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:43,980
I had a cub fucking shoot my dog. They
were looking for weed. I know of her,

1269
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:47,880
those stories. I've seen the videos.
I know there's cops that that happens.

1270
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,290
There's definitely cops are cons.

1271
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:54,770
But I just think overall it's an insanely
hard job that gets zero reward and it

1272
01:11:55,651 --> 01:12:00,060
builds up a resentment. And you know,
human beings don't like being resented.

1273
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,210
They don't like being, they don't
like that feeling of resentment.

1274
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,240
They don't like resenting people
that they don't like the animosity.

1275
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:09,960
They just don't. We were not
designed to absorb animosity. Well,

1276
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:15,570
and you know that animosity that cops
receive and when every good person

1277
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,390
generally looks at you and
says, oh, fuck the fucking cops.

1278
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:21,030
Because you're always just
buzzkill in whatever they're doing.

1279
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,530
They're putting in a terrible spot.

1280
01:12:22,531 --> 01:12:26,320
Having to defend these we'd laws
and psychedelic laws. And you know,

1281
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:29,760
even some of the alcohol laws,
you know, for a 20 year old,

1282
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:33,570
he wants to fucking drink some beers
in his house or whatever, quotas,

1283
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:37,650
ticket quotas, all the, all
of these [inaudible] things
they have to do, you know,

1284
01:12:37,651 --> 01:12:39,000
causes people to despise.

1285
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:43,410
Imagine if none of those laws existed
and cops were only there for the stuff

1286
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:45,690
that you really wanted them. Therefore
people would love the cost for like,

1287
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:50,220
oh fucking sweet rate cops are here. And
murder rate, fee, fee, fee, fee delivery.

1288
01:12:50,221 --> 01:12:52,980
Yeah. Yeah. You'd be pumped and
be like, yes, the cops are here.

1289
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,170
Awesome there around.
I love it when the cops are around,

1290
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:59,210
but because they have to enforce these
terrible laws that you know are bullshit

1291
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:01,260
and it just fucking up your day,
you know,

1292
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:06,261
raising revenue or even worse trying
to bust you for exploring your own

1293
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:10,260
consciousness. You kind of fucking
hate him and resent them. You know,

1294
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:14,580
we could do that would crush almost
every police department all across the

1295
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:15,414
country.

1296
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,100
Everybody just drive the speed
limit and obey all traffic laws.

1297
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,320
They would,

1298
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:25,740
it would destroy them because they're
so used to pulling in x amount of money

1299
01:13:25,741 --> 01:13:28,770
per month that if we
could go a few months,

1300
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:32,580
just a few months of no
track traffic stops ever.

1301
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:36,770
People literally they would, they would
just start false flagging people. Yeah,

1302
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,730
they would, they would
have to, they would start,

1303
01:13:38,731 --> 01:13:42,420
they would go after you and they would
set up a fake crime and then arrest you

1304
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:46,260
for it. Sort of like the war on drugs,
sort of like, you know, the DEA would do,

1305
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,240
I mean, what would they do
if everybody stops on wheat?

1306
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:52,560
They would find retards and talked him
into selling them weed and then arrest

1307
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:52,920
them.

1308
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,020
That's what they would do if everybody
just totally stopped selling weed with

1309
01:13:56,021 --> 01:13:56,521
the DEA.

1310
01:13:56,521 --> 01:14:00,330
Go out of business the fuck it would
if all these Mexican drug cartel said,

1311
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:01,350
listen man,
you know,

1312
01:14:01,351 --> 01:14:04,860
we did some Iowasca and we've got
a different point of view and man,

1313
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:08,400
it's not cool to harm people. So, uh,
look, we made a lot of money. We're good,

1314
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,950
we're done. We're just getting out of the
business. We're not selling anymore. We,

1315
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:11,980
and then everyone

1316
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,530
in America said, you know what,
man? Um, grow your own weed.

1317
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:17,920
I'm not selling any weed. That's it.
We're done. It was no one else to bus.

1318
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,960
No one is selling weed. There's no
one to bust. What would they do?

1319
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,960
They would set people up, man. They
would, they would keep their job.

1320
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:28,060
There's an organism would preserve its
identity and it would preserve its life.

1321
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:31,870
It would preserve its existence and
the only way to serve the existing,

1322
01:14:31,871 --> 01:14:33,410
you've got arrest motherfuckers.
Yeah.

1323
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:38,200
If we didn't have any traffic
violations at all for a few months,

1324
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:41,830
it would bankrupt most police departments.
Isn't that insane?

1325
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,500
Like they're dependent on crime.

1326
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:47,780
It least this petty crime of parking.
Sure.

1327
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,230
And speeding and not stopping and done.

1328
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:53,170
These private prisons would
start to crumble if, you know,

1329
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:57,070
you took away all of the inmates were
there for these drug charges, you know?

1330
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,050
So yeah. And that's,
that was a good point.

1331
01:14:59,051 --> 01:15:02,360
There's a documentary of the house I
live in and they make a great, you know,

1332
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,520
a great case for that.

1333
01:15:03,521 --> 01:15:07,540
How all these private prison systems
need to throw these people in prison at

1334
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:11,950
these overwhelmingly level high levels
compared to the rest of the world is

1335
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:15,580
they're surviving like an organism, like
all these other countries, you know,

1336
01:15:15,581 --> 01:15:16,540
big corporations,

1337
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:20,600
they're like an organism that's going
to survive at fucking any costs. Yeah,

1338
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,250
and it doesn't have to be like that. You
don't have to be that type of organism,

1339
01:15:24,251 --> 01:15:28,990
but it requires some consciousness at
the fucking brain of the organism to make

1340
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:32,920
sure that it's not well and it's so
blatant to when you find out that these

1341
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,720
people that need these jobs lobby to make
sure that these jobs are in place and

1342
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:41,200
the way they do that is to make sure the
things are illegal so they can arrest

1343
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:44,800
people like the policemen's,
the the guards,

1344
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,430
the prison guards union,
they,

1345
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:51,460
they make sure that they spend money
to make sure the drugs stay illegal.

1346
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:55,900
Like they work actively, they spend money
on making sure that marijuana is legal,

1347
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:58,960
like, well who would do that? Who would
do that based on the facts in hand?

1348
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,500
Someone who profits from that.
Right.

1349
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:05,110
Some of the profits from drugs being
illegal and the way they profit is more

1350
01:16:05,111 --> 01:16:08,320
people get arrested and then they
keep their job as a prison guard.

1351
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:12,910
That is slavery, no matter
how you slice it. That is it.

1352
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:16,420
Just a tricky way of being a slave master.

1353
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:20,950
What you're doing is you're figuring out
this real sneaky way to enforce slavery

1354
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:23,950
and it, but just not slavery. It's a
choice. You don't want to follow the law.

1355
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:24,880
Shut up stupid.

1356
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:29,530
Shut your fucking internal dialogue right
now because the law is just some shit

1357
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:33,910
that people wrote down.
Nobody wants marijuana to be illegal,

1358
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:37,840
but idiots. No one. When you look
at the actual facts behind it,

1359
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:40,990
if you can't argue the facts, then
it's, there's no conversation.

1360
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:46,200
And when the LD 50 which is a lethal
dose at 50% meaning if there's 20 of us,

1361
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,320
we all take the same amount, half of
us would be dead. What's that number?

1362
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:54,880
1500 pounds in 15 minutes.
Okay,

1363
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:59,050
we're done here, right? We're done here.
You don't have to worry about that. Okay,

1364
01:16:59,051 --> 01:17:02,110
let's what else he got? Draino people
would drink a drain though. Yeah.

1365
01:17:02,111 --> 01:17:06,100
Don't do that. Okay. Yeah, let's make that
not cool. You can't sell draino drinks.

1366
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,170
Fuck is wrong with people.

1367
01:17:08,171 --> 01:17:12,080
But the idea that someone would
lobby to keep marijuana illegal,

1368
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,520
that's what we see.

1369
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,760
How laws and things that are written
down on paper can really fuck with people

1370
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,720
because it becomes doctrine.
It becomes law.

1371
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:28,400
It becomes what it becomes is this
rigid thing that can't be worked around.

1372
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:33,260
It doesn't have any flexibility. There's
no gray area. It is this, or is that,

1373
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,540
and you ended up with this,
this almost doctrine that's based on some,

1374
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,120
it's like faith. It's like
a new religion. You know?

1375
01:17:40,121 --> 01:17:45,121
It's like saying that you know the urges
to have sex inside you or masturbate or

1376
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:48,130
evil and you need to go to the church.
Okay?

1377
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:51,730
You made something that fucking makes
sure that everybody feels guilty and

1378
01:17:51,731 --> 01:17:55,270
everybody needs a priest because
everybody's going to want to touch their

1379
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:56,104
genitals.

1380
01:17:56,170 --> 01:18:00,370
So you just figured something out of way
to fucking hack the system so that you

1381
01:18:00,371 --> 01:18:03,700
get everybody in some form
of psychic or mental slavery.

1382
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:06,250
And in the prison system.
I've never heard that analogy,

1383
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:07,510
but you're fucking absolutely right.

1384
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:11,040
It's like you're enslaving
them for your own profit. Yeah.

1385
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:15,880
Actively making sure
that people are in jail.

1386
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:20,260
They're making sure that there's laws in
place that will ensure that more people

1387
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:24,670
will get arrested. You know, there's
a movement and the movement is, well,

1388
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:29,671
there's ethical considerations when it
comes to private prisons and laws and

1389
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:35,590
also laws where there's no victim
victims. Fucking victim. I need a job.

1390
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:39,160
I need to keep my family fat to work
we've got to do is we're going to lobby to

1391
01:18:39,161 --> 01:18:42,490
make sure drugs are legal,
drugs are bad for families,

1392
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,720
and so they have this rhetoric and this
rhetoric fuels the debate and the laws

1393
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:50,350
get passed or the congressmen gets
greased or whatever the fuck happens.

1394
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:54,490
And then the laws stay the same or
even tightened down. In some cases,

1395
01:18:54,491 --> 01:18:57,730
more people go to jail
and these fat cats profit,

1396
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,550
which is so strange because it's,

1397
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,830
it's as easily definable as slavery,
as anything that's ever been.

1398
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,960
You look at, yeah, you look at it, I can't
help but draw the parallels. You know,

1399
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:11,490
to religion. So religion,
you get tired or whatever.

1400
01:19:11,491 --> 01:19:14,430
You get pap to pay 10% or
whatever the fuck I'm out.

1401
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,920
So you're paying for the
church always from the bar,

1402
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,810
and then you look at the means that
they went to make sure that everybody

1403
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:23,480
escribed well burning people
at a stake who didn't believe.

1404
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,270
That's a pretty good way to ensure that
you're going to get 10% of that person's

1405
01:19:27,271 --> 01:19:27,870
money.

1406
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:32,870
And then making sure that they're guilty
always 24 fucking seven because you've

1407
01:19:33,241 --> 01:19:36,840
made the urge to have sex, which is
like the urge to eat or take a dump.

1408
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:38,250
It's not going to go away.

1409
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:42,120
You made that as sin and the only way to
absolve it is to get the priest. Well,

1410
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,640
yeah. All right, you're going to make
a fucking lot of money doing that.

1411
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:47,460
You know what? Whereas if the
priests were cool and you know,

1412
01:19:47,461 --> 01:19:51,480
maybe as if Jesus's teachings
were intended and we're like, hey,

1413
01:19:51,481 --> 01:19:54,510
you can find this anywhere you want.
You got to look inside.

1414
01:19:54,511 --> 01:19:59,070
You find the truth about God
inside yourself and through
love and through all of

1415
01:19:59,071 --> 01:20:02,010
these things, you know, people
would be like, hey, thanks brother,

1416
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:05,430
and they are not going to give you 10%
and let you do all this crazy shit.

1417
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,220
You know, it's just
manipulation, manipulation

1418
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:12,150
for profit. Well, that's, I
think the good churches, uh,

1419
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,170
probably do 10% that the band churches
pass around baskets and they're

1420
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:20,730
constantly begging and asking for. I mean,
who knows? What do you remember when,

1421
01:20:20,731 --> 01:20:22,140
who is a fucking that preacher?

1422
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:25,080
Was it Benny Hinn that had a
rolls Royce and he said they'd go,

1423
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,850
God wanted them to drive a Rolls Royce.

1424
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:31,650
It doesn't surprise me one
of those motherfuckers, but
I'm like, that is so bold.

1425
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,300
God wanted you to drive a Rolls Royce.
They just bad. They just made shit up.

1426
01:20:36,301 --> 01:20:36,880
I mean,
I was,

1427
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,620
I was going looking at a horrible
experience going into a dungeon of the

1428
01:20:40,621 --> 01:20:45,240
inquisition, right? Italy, boy, darkest,
one of the darkest places I've ever seen.

1429
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:45,660
It's up.

1430
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:50,580
Even the fucking ideas involved in some
of these things and how many of them

1431
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:54,900
involved? You're fucking penis
in your vagina was shocking.

1432
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:59,190
Like 30% of the tortures involve that.
And if they didn't want to do that,

1433
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:04,110
then rape was a way to get cast the
devils out and punish people as well.

1434
01:21:04,111 --> 01:21:06,540
So you,
if you are a priest and an inquisitor,

1435
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:10,860
you could rape someone in order to get
it out after you tortured and mutilated

1436
01:21:10,861 --> 01:21:14,040
their genitals. Okay,
that sounds pretty good.

1437
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:19,070
That's a holy path.
And even 2000 jobs,

1438
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,080
I mean there's parts of Africa where
people are regularly burned to death for

1439
01:21:22,081 --> 01:21:26,250
being witches and there's a bunch of
videos of it online of people convincing

1440
01:21:26,251 --> 01:21:29,760
people that there witches are there.
Someone is bewitched,

1441
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:34,230
a spell was cast under them and families
are literally selling everything they

1442
01:21:34,231 --> 01:21:36,900
have and forcing himself
into indentured servant to,

1443
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:41,070
to pay for which doctor to cure
their children of being witches.

1444
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,740
It's a serious,
serious issue that they have over there.

1445
01:21:43,741 --> 01:21:48,210
And 2014 this day and
age, it's ideologies, man.

1446
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:52,380
Ideologies and beliefs are incredibly
strong things and it's so easy to

1447
01:21:52,381 --> 01:21:56,400
manipulate people because we don't
know. We, we literally, all of us,

1448
01:21:56,401 --> 01:21:59,460
the giant mass of us have no
idea what the fuck is going on.

1449
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,960
You know as much about what life is all
about is anyone who's ever lived ever.

1450
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:08,130
And that's really hard for people
to swallow. So when we come along,

1451
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:11,040
someone that claims to know something,

1452
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:14,670
they take the place of where our
parents were when we were children.

1453
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,220
When you were a child and
you knew almost nothing,

1454
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:21,720
your parents knew more than you, so you
could go to them and they steered you.

1455
01:22:21,721 --> 01:22:23,700
Right?
And that's how you got to be alive today.

1456
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:26,490
And the more fear that
you lived with growing up,

1457
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,830
the more readily you accept that position,

1458
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:31,680
the more terrified you're
being insecure you'll be you.

1459
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:34,470
You have not found personal sovereignty.

1460
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:38,880
So all of a sudden religion comes along
and fills up this spot where your daddy

1461
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:42,000
used to be. Well, your mommy used
to be. And religion tells you.

1462
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:46,770
And I don't mean just any religion,
I mean witchcraft. I mean everything.

1463
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:50,820
Scientology fill in the blank, you
name it. No one has the answers.

1464
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,280
So when someone comes along and they
tell you not only that they have the

1465
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:57,630
answers, but that they need your money
and they need a lot of it and they need,

1466
01:22:57,631 --> 01:23:00,960
they have to, you got to behave in very
specific ways that don't make any sense.

1467
01:23:00,961 --> 01:23:04,100
Like don't jerk off. Yeah. You know,

1468
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:07,780
the only thing that can count on is
stuff that you can reliably find out

1469
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:08,260
yourself.

1470
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:13,260
Any great spiritual teacher is going to
basically send you on your own quest for

1471
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:16,240
knowledge and then let you
come up with your own truth.

1472
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:20,000
Because if it's not reproducible by
yourself, it's probably bullshit. Yeah.

1473
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:20,260
You know,

1474
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:24,280
if you can't get there doing a
psychedelic meditating going in the tank,

1475
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:28,420
trying to actually pursue this quest
for knowledge and you can't come to that

1476
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:31,330
conclusion,
I say most likely you should discard it.

1477
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:34,030
If someone's just trying to
force feed it down your brain,

1478
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:37,630
it should be reproducible. You should
be able to get there. If you try,

1479
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,810
it's also an interactive experience.
You know? It's not like you,

1480
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:43,810
someone gives you information and
then boom, you're a better person now.

1481
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:46,240
You have to be like on a
quest to be a better person,

1482
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:49,120
someone has to say something
that resonates with you.

1483
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:51,100
You have to be able to
internalize what they're saying.

1484
01:23:51,101 --> 01:23:53,560
You have to be able to
analyze what they're saying.

1485
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,330
You have to be able absorb
what they're saying.

1486
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,160
You have to think about
your own life and a lot of,

1487
01:23:57,161 --> 01:23:58,240
we've got to do a lot of work.

1488
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,480
It's not as simple as someone tells
you what's up and then you know,

1489
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:06,460
because if that's almost like winning
the lottery, it's like, you know,

1490
01:24:06,461 --> 01:24:09,280
all of a sudden you have this money.
Okay, now what? Well, you got to spend it.

1491
01:24:09,281 --> 01:24:12,670
You're fucking crazy. You didn't earn that
shit. You don't know how he got there.

1492
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:16,090
If somebody gives you the perfect
knowledge, it's going to be like, wow,

1493
01:24:16,091 --> 01:24:20,920
that totally makes sense. And then off
to off to do heroine. No. Well, yeah man,

1494
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:24,220
I couldn't help myself just fucking, I
just need that crack. Yeah, it's not real.

1495
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:26,530
It doesn't have value.
You gotta be searching.

1496
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,510
You gotta be searching to
clean up your own life.

1497
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:32,110
That's one of the things they say about
people when it comes to getting clean.

1498
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,370
People that are, they're abusing drugs
or alcohol, getting clean and sober,

1499
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:40,090
like you have to hit your rock bottom
where you realize you got to do something

1500
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:42,040
about your life until you realize it,

1501
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,680
all the people in the world telling
you to get your shit together,

1502
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,290
it's not going to matter. It doesn't
mean anything. You're just going to,

1503
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:50,500
you're going to placate them. You know
what, man, you're right. I'm done, man.

1504
01:24:50,501 --> 01:24:53,360
I'm done. Done fucking use,
man. I'm done. Meanwhile,

1505
01:24:53,361 --> 01:24:57,460
as soon as you get away from them, you're
calling up your dealer. You know, Eddie,

1506
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,350
Eddie Bravo had, um, uh,

1507
01:24:59,351 --> 01:25:04,351
an ex that had a meth problem
and he didn't know about
it and he found out about

1508
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:08,560
it because, uh, I think
he, he was like, he,

1509
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:11,290
she didn't know he was home or something
like that and he was listening to a

1510
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:15,220
phone call and he couldn't
fucking believe it. Like, I think,

1511
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:18,370
I think that was what happened. But like
when he listened to it, he was like,

1512
01:25:18,371 --> 01:25:19,720
Holy Shit.

1513
01:25:19,721 --> 01:25:24,250
Like living with this check had no idea
she was doing meth and then he leaves

1514
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,800
and she's like, yeah, what do you got?
You know I need, I need to get some,

1515
01:25:26,801 --> 01:25:29,290
I need to get high. Like
right now I got, you know,

1516
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,100
like what he got like and he was like,
whoa.

1517
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:35,500
And then he sort of figured it out and
then confronted her but didn't know,

1518
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,760
had no idea. And you know, tell her, hey,
you know, you gotta stop doing this. Yeah.

1519
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:43,240
Yeah, you're right. I'm fucking done. Done
with that shit cause he gone. Okay, good.

1520
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:47,740
I need to get some fucking math right
now. Okay. Not yesterday and then an hour.

1521
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:52,630
I need it now. And if till
that person says, Hey,

1522
01:25:52,631 --> 01:25:56,320
I got to stop doing meth. I don't want
to be this person, um, I've fucking,

1523
01:25:56,321 --> 01:25:58,750
I'm going to test my will.
I'm going to change my life.

1524
01:25:58,751 --> 01:26:00,460
I'm going to steer this battleship.

1525
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:04,520
I'm going to figure out a way off the
rocks until that person makes that

1526
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:07,610
decision, no movement's
going to take place. You'll,

1527
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,640
that's why I fucking hate talking with
people when they start talking to me

1528
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:12,530
about losing weight and um,
you know,

1529
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:15,740
but just I think in wanting me to do is
just drop, you know, I just, I guess a,

1530
01:26:15,741 --> 01:26:19,640
I see it late at night at, hey,
just fucking do it man. Just stop.

1531
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:22,600
Don't talk to me because
you're just jerking off of
my face. That's what you do.

1532
01:26:22,601 --> 01:26:26,960
And this is a form of mental masturbation.
You know, you're, you're, I, I, I get it.

1533
01:26:26,961 --> 01:26:30,320
You're trying to look for inspiration.
You, you got to find it in inside of you.

1534
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,600
We can have these conversations once,

1535
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:37,080
but if we have them twice and then three
times and then four times and then I

1536
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:40,580
don't see you for six months and you're
fatter, you can go fuck yourself. Okay,

1537
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:43,850
I'm done. And not going to
keep doing this, man. I'm
not going to keep doing this.

1538
01:26:43,851 --> 01:26:46,790
You know what you gotta do what?
You got to find something,

1539
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:49,890
and I don't know if freewill
is real because there's the,

1540
01:26:49,891 --> 01:26:54,890
there's the big philosophical debate is
there a freewill isn't every decision

1541
01:26:54,891 --> 01:26:59,750
you make based on a variety of things
and include genetics, epigenetics,

1542
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:01,340
life experiences.

1543
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:05,540
You know what path you'd going
left as opposed to going, right?

1544
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:08,480
What happened to you before you had any
control over your life when you were a

1545
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:11,590
baby, your whole personality is
formed by the time we were two.

1546
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,530
Well then you start factoring on the
getting to that sort of philosophical

1547
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:18,350
debate. That's all good in the
hood. That's all cool in the gang.

1548
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:21,320
But I know for a fact
that some people change,

1549
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:23,960
so either you're going to be
one of those motherfuckers,

1550
01:27:23,961 --> 01:27:26,540
it changes or you're not going to be one
of those motherfuckers that's changes.

1551
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:28,450
You can get philosophical all day long.

1552
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,400
Say there is no freewill and you know
I'm not going to do it because there's no

1553
01:27:31,401 --> 01:27:34,610
free will and hey, I'm just happy being
a way to let yourself off the hook.

1554
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:38,030
It's exactly what it is. You're being
a bitch and I'm here to let you know.

1555
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:40,070
That's what I'm here for. I'm
the, I'm the being a bitch.

1556
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,090
You're being a bitch police.

1557
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:44,990
I'm here to let you know I think
William James Cause I was you know,

1558
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,270
study a lot of philosophy and his take
on the freewill argument was one of my

1559
01:27:48,271 --> 01:27:52,080
favorites and it's like I dunno if there
is free will or not but my life is a

1560
01:27:52,081 --> 01:27:54,510
hell of a lot better if
I believe it is true.

1561
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:58,070
You know and I'm going to be fucking
making decisions for myself that are going

1562
01:27:58,071 --> 01:28:01,970
to benefit my life and I'm going to act
sure as shit as if there is free will

1563
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,520
cause this, watch me, you know and that
was it. It was like whatever you guys,

1564
01:28:05,521 --> 01:28:08,430
philosophers want to argue about,
fine. That's cool. Good for you.

1565
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:12,140
But I'd say that there is just because
it's better for me and I'm going to

1566
01:28:12,141 --> 01:28:13,920
fucking make shit happen.
I know there is

1567
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:18,310
no, I know there is alarm clocks
bitch. It's that fucking simple.

1568
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:23,730
I exercise my will and determination with
alarm clocks because when alarm clocks

1569
01:28:25,511 --> 01:28:28,210
go off,
I fucking get up and I get up.

1570
01:28:28,211 --> 01:28:33,040
Not just because of all the newer new
free does just just what I do. No,

1571
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:36,850
I do it on purpose. I know I do
it. I know it's hard to do. I know,

1572
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:40,090
I know I do that and I could
just shut it off. You know,

1573
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,310
I could just fucking shut it off,

1574
01:28:42,730 --> 01:28:45,790
but unplugged the phone in the hotel and
sleep for a couple of days or I want to

1575
01:28:45,791 --> 01:28:48,460
do, I'll fucking call everybody
in a few days. They'll be fine,

1576
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:52,360
they'll freak out a little bit. But if I
want to do that, I'll do it. That, yeah,

1577
01:28:52,361 --> 01:28:54,820
you can do it. Do whatever
the fuck you want to do. Man.

1578
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,440
I know,
I know in a different way.

1579
01:28:57,441 --> 01:29:00,650
And that's just from my
own experiences of being,

1580
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:03,760
of separating myself
from that aton you know,

1581
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:08,780
that robotic mind and just becoming that
higher part of yourself and that that

1582
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:11,910
is the part of you that really
does have free will. You know,

1583
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:15,360
there's this higher consciousness
that can stop everything.

1584
01:29:15,361 --> 01:29:17,110
Just say the whole thing.

1585
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:21,510
[inaudible] throw the fucking brakes on
and then make some decisions. You know,

1586
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:25,920
and maybe there's winds that blow
influences currents that are gonna shape

1587
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:28,590
different ideas of thought.
But man,

1588
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:31,830
when you're in that state and you
can really feel connected to that,

1589
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:34,080
to that person driving your ship,

1590
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,270
you know that tree will cause
you can fucking feel it.

1591
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:40,790
There's something you can decide to be a
better person. Yeah, you absolutely can.

1592
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:44,630
People had been doing it
from the beginning of time.
You can better yourself.

1593
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:48,890
And that's one of the reasons
why inspirational people
are so important because

1594
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:54,040
you can make choices based on inspiration
that is freewill defined the thing we

1595
01:29:54,731 --> 01:29:56,840
were talking about,
about being inspired by people,

1596
01:29:56,841 --> 01:30:01,700
surrounding yourself with positive people
and using that positivity to reinforce

1597
01:30:01,701 --> 01:30:05,350
your own life and inspire your own life.
That is free will. That is freewill,

1598
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,550
broken down to its most beneficial aspect.

1599
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:11,750
The most beneficial aspect of freewill
is the ability to choose to better

1600
01:30:11,751 --> 01:30:12,470
yourself,

1601
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:16,250
to be influenced by positive things
where there was love or whatever it is.

1602
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:18,460
Well it would have those things
didn't happen. And you don't,

1603
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:20,600
you wouldn't have free
will because of free will.

1604
01:30:20,601 --> 01:30:23,660
It's just you reacting to your
environment. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1605
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,480
Everybody says that's weak by the way.

1606
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:29,090
You ever notice that it's not a bunch
of fucking savage champions. Yeah. That,

1607
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:33,170
that don't believe in freewill. Now they
all tell you, you have to test your will.

1608
01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:35,310
You have to test it. You know, and and,

1609
01:30:35,311 --> 01:30:39,200
and people who've never truly tested
there will be never truly tried to run up

1610
01:30:39,201 --> 01:30:41,450
that mountain with that 130
pound rock on your back.

1611
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:46,280
If you never really tried to do Jujitsu
and tried to do battle with another

1612
01:30:46,281 --> 01:30:49,940
skilled person for 20 fucking minutes
where you're both your hearts ready to

1613
01:30:49,941 --> 01:30:53,450
explode and your chest and your fucking
arms made out of rubber, you don't know.

1614
01:30:53,451 --> 01:30:57,140
You don't know about pushing yourself.
You don't, you don't. You haven't,

1615
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:59,360
you haven't really tested yourself.

1616
01:30:59,361 --> 01:31:02,840
You've just gotten in your car and driven
to your cubicle every day and put in

1617
01:31:02,841 --> 01:31:05,250
your hours and then you want to talk shit.
All right?

1618
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:06,770
But that's not how life works.

1619
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:10,580
The way life works is you get your shit
talking license when you accomplish

1620
01:31:10,581 --> 01:31:14,210
something. And Ironically speaking,
once you've accomplished something,

1621
01:31:14,211 --> 01:31:18,470
you're least likely to want to talk shit.
That's it. That's the irony of it all.

1622
01:31:18,471 --> 01:31:22,130
But then by talking shit, I mean bragging
and, and, and mean. And there is,

1623
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:26,930
there's recanting and re recounting
rather recounting special experiences,

1624
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,940
um,
that are fascinating.

1625
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:32,750
Whether I love talking to martial artists
that talk about the greatest victories

1626
01:31:32,751 --> 01:31:35,690
I love talking to. And it doesn't,
that doesn't mean they're bragging.

1627
01:31:35,691 --> 01:31:37,580
It doesn't mean not,
don't talk about accomplishments,

1628
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:42,790
but most people know the difference
between enacting and react reenacting

1629
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:49,250
experiences and pulling their
lessons out of those experiences.

1630
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:51,680
And people who are just
trying to pump themselves up.

1631
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:55,350
And when you're around someone who's just
trying to pump themselves up and they,

1632
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:00,070
they're bullshitting and it's, it's
a gross oily, feeling it from a need

1633
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,580
deep inside to fill up some void.
They fill in their own,

1634
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,920
in their own mind and their
own ego and their own mindset.

1635
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:10,930
So that need requires positive
reinforcement from other people,

1636
01:32:10,931 --> 01:32:14,110
but that's going to be a vacuous hole
that they're never going to fill.

1637
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,740
And so unless they've already conquered
that, they're not going to be that good.

1638
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,220
Like you have to get past
that to really be, you know,

1639
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:24,610
one of the true masters in nuts.
There's a rare occasion where, you know,

1640
01:32:24,611 --> 01:32:25,720
as we said before,

1641
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:31,020
someone's raw ability is
just so unbelievably savage
on another level that they

1642
01:32:31,361 --> 01:32:34,540
do get to be ostensibly a champion.
You know,

1643
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:36,040
without actually having gone through it.

1644
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:39,640
I'm sure there are cases of that where
someone is just so fucking gifted that

1645
01:32:39,641 --> 01:32:43,360
they've gotten away with not actually
facing the demons on the journey,

1646
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:45,580
but that's super rare and
I've never encountered,

1647
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,350
I think in certain, um, fight sports,

1648
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:53,530
it's actually possible to get incredibly
proficient and not be a true master of

1649
01:32:54,441 --> 01:32:57,410
yourself. Mike Tyson, I think is
one of the greatest examples ever.

1650
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,880
Mike Tyson has come out and said that he
was on coke through a great part of his

1651
01:33:01,881 --> 01:33:05,870
career. Like he was doing coke and
fighting. I mean, and he was cool,

1652
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:07,100
literally out of control.

1653
01:33:07,101 --> 01:33:10,610
Whether or not he raped that Desiree
woman who was accused of raping.

1654
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:14,300
I don't know. I wasn't
there, but whatever that was,

1655
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,880
you have to take into
consideration a couple of things.

1656
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:20,370
Would that particular case,
one, she had falsely accused,

1657
01:33:20,371 --> 01:33:24,290
I'm going to rape just a year before.
Sure. That's one. And you know too,

1658
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:28,340
she took her panties shield off when
she got into the bathroom. Those, those,

1659
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:30,500
both of those things don't
look so good for her.

1660
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:33,470
It doesn't mean that she didn't say
no and he didn't rape her. Okay,

1661
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,600
so who knows what actually did happen,

1662
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:40,970
but take away that one experience and
just look at all the crazy shit that guy

1663
01:33:40,971 --> 01:33:42,350
did.
He was a maniac.

1664
01:33:42,351 --> 01:33:46,100
He was buying Bentleys and Rolls Royces
every day and Punched Mick Green,

1665
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:46,911
Mitch Mitch,

1666
01:33:46,911 --> 01:33:50,270
Blood Green at a fucking
Harlem Haberdashery at two
o'clock in the morning and

1667
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:54,230
he wasn't living like some fucking stoic
monk. You saw that show that he did.

1668
01:33:54,231 --> 01:33:58,640
He put on. I see it. It's pretty good.
I heard. It's amazing. It's awesome.

1669
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:02,600
My point is he was the
baddest motherfucker of all
time while he was doing all

1670
01:34:02,601 --> 01:34:03,434
this craziness.

1671
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:08,980
But the thing that he did do
is insane amounts of work,

1672
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:14,090
insane intensity, insane focus and
determination and a deep, deep,

1673
01:34:14,091 --> 01:34:17,540
deep knowledge of his craft.
A huge knowledge.

1674
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,640
I mean the reason why he
had that high top fade,

1675
01:34:19,641 --> 01:34:22,250
we shave the sides of his head
cause that's what Jack Dempsey did.

1676
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,010
He watched Jack Dempsey from
the time he was a fucking child,

1677
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:30,220
like constantly imitated and mimic the
movements of Jack Dempsey gotten much

1678
01:34:31,161 --> 01:34:33,620
better in my opinion.
He's way better than Jack Dempsey.

1679
01:34:33,930 --> 01:34:37,820
When you watched Jack Dempsey move around
and see if we can pull that up. Jamie,

1680
01:34:37,821 --> 01:34:40,300
pull up a video of Jack Dempsey.
Is this a,

1681
01:34:40,301 --> 01:34:44,330
a perfect example of how someone can be
inspired by someone who sucks compared

1682
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:45,880
to them?
You know,

1683
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,540
because because Tyson was just this spring
loaded like took a piece of metal and

1684
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:53,240
you're just fucking bent it back.
Well he was,

1685
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:58,270
he was boxing when it hit this new
incredible level where so many things were

1686
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:02,660
involved. First of all, there was
decades and decades and decades,

1687
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:06,800
over a hundred years of knowledge
when it came to, you know,

1688
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:11,240
what was effective, what was not
effective is this, this is not a fight.

1689
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:15,140
This isn't like sparring. A
lot of pieces. A fight must be,

1690
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:19,070
well a lot of people would get to watch
that guy train. Yeah, that's a fight.

1691
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:23,330
That's definitely a fight. Jack Dempsey
was a fucking animal looking at various,

1692
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,920
it's wailing on this motherfucker

1693
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,760
kind of punches like Badr Hari does
know everything showing you everything

1694
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:35,900
trying to crush you. He was a hard
hit and motherfucker to Jack Dempsey,

1695
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:38,090
Mike Tyson.
Oh Jesus.

1696
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,210
And they hovered over you back
then after they knocked you down.

1697
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:46,400
That look up bloody. That dude is
oh shit son back then when they, um,

1698
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:47,480
when they knocked you down,

1699
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:51,200
they stood over you and every time you
got up they'd punch you again. No Way.

1700
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:52,880
Yeah. They watched, she hovers over him.

1701
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:57,170
There was no standing eight counts back
then they would drop you and then when

1702
01:35:57,171 --> 01:36:00,260
you would get on one knee and as soon as
you need to lift, lifted off the ground,

1703
01:36:00,261 --> 01:36:04,160
they fucking punch you in the face again,
which it sounds gangster.

1704
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:07,940
But look at MMA and I, you go to the
ground, I fucking mount your face,

1705
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:10,250
punch you into oblivion.
And that's a way crazier.

1706
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,630
So it's funny that people are like,

1707
01:36:11,631 --> 01:36:14,720
no way they punched him in the head
while they were down. Yeah, they, they,

1708
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:16,790
they hovered over you.
You do you,

1709
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:20,960
what do you think about the idea that
if they just took off all the gloves,

1710
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:23,180
it could be safe as far as to be wasted?
It's pretty,

1711
01:36:23,181 --> 01:36:24,740
pretty scientifically clear right now.

1712
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:28,610
Pull up Mike Tyson versus Marvis Frazier.

1713
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:33,530
This is a, in my opinion,
the best version of a,

1714
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:36,950
of Mike Tyson,
the scariest version of Mike Tyson.

1715
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:39,050
When Mike Tyson fought Marvis Frazier.

1716
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:42,520
It was when he was on his way to the
heavyweight title and he had not been

1717
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:46,550
defeated Trevor Berbick yet, but he
was on his way. But, uh, just pull it,

1718
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:48,260
pull it up so he could just see the fight.

1719
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,840
Cause the fight only lasts
for about fucking 10 seconds.

1720
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:56,260
But he swarms that motherfucker in a way
that to this day is the most terrifying

1721
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:02,591
beating I've ever seen
anybody give anybody inside
a boxing ring because Marvis

1722
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,870
Frazier had zero chance. He
wasn't a hungry, evil fighter.

1723
01:37:05,871 --> 01:37:08,120
He was the son of one of
the greatest of all time.

1724
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:09,440
It didn't really have it himself.

1725
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:13,220
And he was fighting a guy who was going
to be the greatest heavyweight of all

1726
01:37:13,221 --> 01:37:18,221
time in his greatest time
when he's surging and coming
up looking for a shot at

1727
01:37:19,851 --> 01:37:24,851
the title and he just corners Marvis
Frazier here and just on fucking loads,

1728
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:29,450
Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang.
Every punch is perfect.

1729
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:33,830
Massive amounts of torque and
muscle by an every fist to his face.

1730
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,060
And he,

1731
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:38,930
that one combination puts Marvis Frazier
out of boxing for the rest of his life.

1732
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:42,680
I mean he, I think he boxed again after
that, but he was a shadow of himself.

1733
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:46,760
Everyone knew he was never going to be
the heavyweight champion and he was never

1734
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:49,730
going to be able to beat this
fucking monster. I mean, he,

1735
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,330
he didn't offer any resistance whatsoever.
And look at these combinations,

1736
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:57,870
how he is so accurate.
So that's way better than Jack Dempsey.

1737
01:37:57,990 --> 01:37:59,700
See My, my point, he's like,

1738
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:04,230
you look at Jack Dempsey who inspired
Mike Tyson and Mike Tyson is fucking way

1739
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:07,470
better than Jack Dempsey. I mean
way, way, way, way, way better.

1740
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:09,990
Sam Kennison was inspired by Lenny Bruce,

1741
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:14,280
but if you watch Lenny Bruce and watched
Sam Kennison, he'd go, oh Jesus Christ.

1742
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:15,780
Like Lenny Bruce,
if,

1743
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:21,140
if you like trying to watch
it today as a 2014 comedian,

1744
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,810
like if he was a guy like, this is a guy
I heard about, his name is Lenny Bruce.

1745
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:27,330
He'd be like, Oh my God, this
guy's boring. He's so boring.

1746
01:38:27,331 --> 01:38:28,350
He's saying the obvious shit.

1747
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:32,940
It wasn't obvious shit in 1950
1950 he was fucking crazy,

1748
01:38:32,941 --> 01:38:34,260
groundbreaking stuff.

1749
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:37,500
I mean he was saying things that nobody
had ever even thought you would hear on

1750
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:41,100
stage before he was and he was going to
jail for them and that guy went to jail

1751
01:38:41,101 --> 01:38:44,160
countless times just for profanity,

1752
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,300
just for just speaking his mind and
and talking about the, the, the,

1753
01:38:48,301 --> 01:38:50,160
the language that we use.

1754
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:55,320
I mean he would use profanity in talking
about how odd it is that we have these

1755
01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:56,550
restrictions on language.

1756
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,060
Sure.

1757
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,600
You hear so many people talk about how
they're building off the backs of the

1758
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:04,920
giants from, from times ago, you
know, from whatever, whatever,

1759
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,690
whatever it is in science,

1760
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:10,530
in art and in sport and all of that.
You know,

1761
01:39:10,531 --> 01:39:15,250
you build off of what created before
and make it generally, you know,

1762
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,631
better.

1763
01:39:15,631 --> 01:39:19,320
You get to take what they knew and the
best people do is take what they knew,

1764
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:23,220
take how far they went, and then take
it even farther, you know, and then,

1765
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:27,090
then you think about some things like you
look at Graham Hancock's work and then

1766
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:27,810
you wonder,

1767
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:31,110
well what happens if everything just
gets fucking taken away and you have to

1768
01:39:31,111 --> 01:39:31,711
start over.

1769
01:39:31,711 --> 01:39:36,600
What if all the UFC tapes completely
went out of people's consciousness?

1770
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:40,380
This whole generation, it's only 25
years and this generation gets wiped out.

1771
01:39:40,381 --> 01:39:41,214
A new one comes up.

1772
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:45,210
They've got to figure that shit out all
over again and they're going to suck for

1773
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:48,480
a long time. A long time, you know,
because they're not going to have that,

1774
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,980
that to build off of.
Whereas now, you know,

1775
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,260
people are just going to get more and more
efficient and and capable at this art.

1776
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:59,910
Yeah. If people had to figure out how to
do a wheel kick from scratch, oh yeah.

1777
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,740
And land it spin and hit someone
in the head with your head,

1778
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,540
it would take forever for them to even
think of it, you know? Yeah. I mean,

1779
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:08,950
it'll take a long time.

1780
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,530
Oh, do you? The idea that you
could kick someone in the face,

1781
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:14,710
you could pick up your leg and kick
someone in the face. Like what? No,

1782
01:40:14,711 --> 01:40:17,260
you can kick them when they're down
and kick them when they're up here.

1783
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:19,750
Get outta here.
That's not even fucking possible.

1784
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:22,030
And then he showed the Jonelle
Serone video and you're like,

1785
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:24,910
get the fuck outta here.
How did he figure that out?

1786
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:27,920
He fucking hit him with his shin.
Whoa.

1787
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:30,440
And people who don't do
martial arts sometimes a, um,

1788
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:34,990
I have friends that have come to the
UFC and they have no idea what he did to

1789
01:40:34,991 --> 01:40:39,770
the guy like a Steve Rinella.
This guy was a, this guy, um,

1790
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,083
uh,

1791
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:46,180
a bag routine off was a fighting
this dude who was going for, uh,

1792
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:51,220
the John, John Linacre, John Leonard who
was going for a leg lock on bog routine.

1793
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,300
Often it was at the end of the fight,

1794
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:57,630
but off his is sambal master and Linacre
is more of a striker than anything is

1795
01:40:57,671 --> 01:40:58,630
Jujitsu sort of.
So,

1796
01:40:58,631 --> 01:41:02,380
so and so boggled teen off was like
laughing that this guy was trying to heal,

1797
01:41:02,381 --> 01:41:04,510
hook them, waved his
fingers. So he stood up,

1798
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:07,750
he standing there while Linacre
is going after his legs,

1799
01:41:07,751 --> 01:41:10,990
not even defending the leg lock.
And he's like going like this,

1800
01:41:10,991 --> 01:41:15,460
like standing there and flexing.
And it's ridiculous because you know like,

1801
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,331
and so my friend was like,

1802
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:21,331
how did he hold that guy down Rinella
thought the bog routine off was holding

1803
01:41:21,401 --> 01:41:24,840
him down with his leg. He was pinning him
with his leg full champion pipe. Yeah.

1804
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,370
I'm like, no, he wasn't actually
pinning him with his leg. He's like,

1805
01:41:27,371 --> 01:41:28,640
why was I got pin in
that guy and was like,

1806
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:32,770
but that a person who doesn't ever
do Marshall, excuse me, martial arts,

1807
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:36,920
they look at some shit and they don't
know what's happening. They're like, like,

1808
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:39,460
how do he hit him with a
Shin? What the heck? That guy,

1809
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:41,650
he flipped around and he
hit the guy with his shin.

1810
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,360
Like they couldn't even recreate it.

1811
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:46,540
If you showed someone and they didn't
have any knowledge of martial arts at all

1812
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:50,920
and you showed them Edson Barboza versus
Terry Adam where Edson Barboza hits him

1813
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:52,870
with this wheel kick from hell.

1814
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:56,440
Like one of the worst wheel case I've
ever seen anybody to absorb in any combat

1815
01:41:56,441 --> 01:42:00,880
sport ever. I mean, the guy just got
it. Terry. Adam looked like he got shot.

1816
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,370
He got shot with a sniper,
just boom,

1817
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:08,380
stiffens up and down like his head
exploded. If you showed that to somebody,

1818
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:09,640
they'd be like,
what did he do?

1819
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:11,700
What's he flipped around through the air.

1820
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,390
The guy flew through the air and
he hit him with his foot, you know,

1821
01:42:15,391 --> 01:42:16,770
like how did he hit him on his foot?

1822
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:20,190
I got crazy like just
jumping through the year.

1823
01:42:20,191 --> 01:42:23,610
Like you wouldn't even know how that
happened actually when I think it was

1824
01:42:23,611 --> 01:42:25,560
hoists.
Gracie right here you're in is right here.

1825
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:31,440
Oh Shit. Are you fucking
kidding me? Like a sniper,

1826
01:42:31,441 --> 01:42:36,120
right? That doesn't, you don't ever
land a more perfect, we'll kick boom,

1827
01:42:36,121 --> 01:42:36,601
look at that.

1828
01:42:36,601 --> 01:42:41,430
I mean that shit is full
flawless technique and he
hit him in the perfect spot.

1829
01:42:41,730 --> 01:42:46,730
Any hit him is Edom is moving forward
like Adam steps to him and it just runs

1830
01:42:47,641 --> 01:42:48,690
right into that heal.

1831
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:52,170
I saw that thing happen.
I think it was hoists Gracie fighting,

1832
01:42:52,171 --> 01:42:56,460
maybe it was Dan Severn or somebody,
but the big guy was on top of hoists.

1833
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:59,400
Hoisin Dan Severn each handled him
and he triangled them and I was,

1834
01:42:59,401 --> 01:43:02,160
I had a bunch of people over at the house.
My family loved these things.

1835
01:43:02,161 --> 01:43:05,520
We watched him from the start and people
were like, what the fuck happened?

1836
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:09,780
What the fuck happened? Like they couldn't
possibly imagine that the guy on top,

1837
01:43:09,781 --> 01:43:14,070
the big guy on top gave up. Why? Why?
How did just what? I don't get it.

1838
01:43:14,071 --> 01:43:16,590
I don't get it. You mean you can
be on top and lose? You know,

1839
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,920
it was like full ma'am. Nobody
understood it at all. Yeah.

1840
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,390
It's like what his legs around the guy's
neck? Yeah. Make them suck is kind of,

1841
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:29,100
can you make him stuck? Is that any theory
was valid at that point? Nobody knew.

1842
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:32,900
I remember watching UFC two was
the first one that ever watched.

1843
01:43:32,901 --> 01:43:36,740
I watched it on video
tape was a VHS tape and a,

1844
01:43:36,741 --> 01:43:41,741
I just come to Hollywood and it was in
like 94 and I was out here doing TV and I

1845
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:46,120
saw 'em at the video store. They had
like UFC two was it, I don't even know.

1846
01:43:46,121 --> 01:43:49,040
UFC One was available.
There was some sort of licensing issue.

1847
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,010
You can only rent UFC two at the,
and so,

1848
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,760
uh,

1849
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:56,770
I got ahold of it and I watched it and I
had been a martial artist since I was a

1850
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:00,530
young boy. So watching this,
all of a sudden I was like,

1851
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:04,550
oh my God,
everything I know is useless.

1852
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,450
I think I really had this feeling
like if that guy got ahold of me,

1853
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:11,450
I'm fucking getting get strangled
just like this big giant guy.

1854
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:15,230
But he's fucking up these big giant guy.
He arm barred chemo, you know, he's,

1855
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:18,680
he's fucking up these guys that are like
way bigger than me that I wouldn't want

1856
01:44:18,681 --> 01:44:21,980
to fight and like, Whoa, how's
he doing that? I think I was,

1857
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:24,830
my size is 170 pounds at the time.
It was like,

1858
01:44:25,650 --> 01:44:29,720
the fuck is he beating these
guys? I immediately was
like, I got to learn Jujitsu.

1859
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:31,580
And then as soon as I went to Jujitsu,

1860
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:35,960
I got mauled over and over and over again.
Like he just,

1861
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:39,260
it completely got my ass kicked
where I thought like, well,

1862
01:44:39,261 --> 01:44:42,920
I've been a martial artist for,
you know, fucking long time.

1863
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:47,750
When I get in there I'm going
to learn easier than most
people. No, no, no, no, no,

1864
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:49,790
no, no, no, no. You're not
going to go in there with any,

1865
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:53,900
I had a little bit of wrestling from
high schools that helped a little bit.

1866
01:44:53,901 --> 01:44:57,680
I kind of knew about manipulating
bodies and I knew about leverage,

1867
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:00,320
but I didn't know any of the techniques.
I didn't know what was going on,

1868
01:45:00,510 --> 01:45:04,400
especially with the gay dudes are
just grabbing my collar and I'm like,

1869
01:45:04,401 --> 01:45:05,234
what's going on here?

1870
01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:10,430
And I was like twisting it around my neck
and fucking holding onto it to put my

1871
01:45:10,431 --> 01:45:13,490
arm in a position when they get snap
it in half and you're like, Oh God,

1872
01:45:13,491 --> 01:45:17,300
I'm so vulnerable. Like it was just
leaving there feeling like, fuck,

1873
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,520
I'm so vulnerable.
I didn't know it was this vulnerable.

1874
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:24,820
I thought it was way tougher
than this. Yeah, changes,

1875
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:27,110
changes the world thing.
These techniques,

1876
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:28,430
you don't even know what
a guy is doing to you.

1877
01:45:28,431 --> 01:45:30,980
And all of a sudden you and
when it's happening to you,

1878
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:34,100
it's even more confusing because
you can't see what's going on.

1879
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:37,000
Sometimes when you're getting strangled,
well, when you get into arm barred,

1880
01:45:37,001 --> 01:45:37,730
like this is,
um,

1881
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:41,540
there's a massive legs and arms and tangle
and you're trying to grapple and all

1882
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:43,070
of a sudden his legs
over across your face,

1883
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:45,570
you don't even seeing what's
happening and you're getting arm bar,

1884
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:47,750
you're not sure,
especially in the beginning,

1885
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,940
you don't recognize the
dangerous positions.

1886
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:52,400
You don't know when to
defend or even how to defend.

1887
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:53,990
So when you get stuck in these spots,

1888
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:57,440
it's literally a mystery where your
arm is screaming in pain. Like,

1889
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:01,190
why am I fucking shut? The fuck
happened there? My shoulder,

1890
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:05,990
why is my hand behind my back?
I remember I grappled Mario Charles,

1891
01:46:05,991 --> 01:46:09,350
who was like a Jujitsu silver
medalist and somewhere in, in Brazil,

1892
01:46:09,351 --> 01:46:12,890
I was in Florida, Annapolis.
And I go to just, I was there.
So I was like, all right,

1893
01:46:12,891 --> 01:46:14,690
well fuck all grapple
with somebody really good.

1894
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:18,050
So I go there and I'd
never really wrestled with,

1895
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:21,050
grappled with somebody who had a good
butterfly guard, like a really good one.

1896
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:26,480
And I was just floating along,
getting arm barred and choked constantly.

1897
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:29,720
I felt like I never fucking
got to the ground, you know,

1898
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:33,410
he's just pushing and pulling
and lifting and flip. I was like,

1899
01:46:33,411 --> 01:46:37,040
this is a fucking new level.
Yeah, this is a whole new game,

1900
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:40,620
especially with the gay, because with
the g they can hold onto collars.

1901
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:43,130
You only hold on, hold on
to the end of your, uh,

1902
01:46:43,131 --> 01:46:46,850
your sleeves and you know those
two things. One Hand in the collar,

1903
01:46:46,851 --> 01:46:51,150
one hand the sleeve man, your hands both
feet under your hips, feet on your hips.

1904
01:46:51,151 --> 01:46:53,820
So you're flying up in the air.
So you got one arm completely locked out.

1905
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:55,530
You're trying to defend
with this on Jesus Christ.

1906
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:58,580
This arms we were fucking
neck is turned sideways.

1907
01:46:58,581 --> 01:47:01,560
Guys got a forum across your neck
holding on tight to your collar.

1908
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:04,860
It's like you've had a video of what
happened to me. That was it. Oh good.

1909
01:47:04,861 --> 01:47:08,720
I've been there. John Shock does that
to me still. And I'm a black robe.

1910
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:11,330
The judge Jack, I'm up
in the air man. When you,

1911
01:47:11,331 --> 01:47:14,640
you know you feel someone is really good
at getting those butterfly guards in

1912
01:47:14,641 --> 01:47:18,120
and flipping you here and there.
It's a skill that you develop,

1913
01:47:18,121 --> 01:47:21,870
the ability to lift someone up and
manipulate them and a lot of people don't

1914
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:26,871
understand how high level the top level
Jujitsu guys have achieved because you

1915
01:47:27,391 --> 01:47:32,160
only see Jujitsu and MMA and
Jujitsu and MMA is a lot.

1916
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:37,430
It's actually like less advanced than
kickboxing and MMA because there's some,

1917
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:41,730
there's some really like
high level kickboxing that
you see occasionally in MMA

1918
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:46,731
with elite fighters and it's also
kickboxing and MMA is a tad more dangerous

1919
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:51,150
than kickboxing and kickboxing
because the gloves are smaller.

1920
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:54,360
You can't protect the same
way like kickboxing. They can,

1921
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:57,420
they can go in this shell,
they have this like [inaudible].

1922
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:58,411
He's really good at that.

1923
01:47:58,411 --> 01:48:01,830
Even the holds up real high with the
shell and they move forward and they throw

1924
01:48:01,831 --> 01:48:03,450
kicks and punches to
come back to that Shell,

1925
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:08,660
but that Shell and MMA
punches still getting slipped
through and one will do you

1926
01:48:08,861 --> 01:48:13,320
in. It's not like a boxing punch with
that big glove is a different sort of a

1927
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:17,580
thunderous effect that are really hard
puncher with an MMA glove house on.

1928
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:19,800
But when there's no striking,

1929
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:23,760
then you get to see what real
high level Jujitsu is all about.

1930
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:28,620
And you get to see a guy like a shock
or ra or a Hodrick Gracie or crone,

1931
01:48:28,621 --> 01:48:33,090
Gracie or Marcello Garcia, these super,
super high level guys going at it.

1932
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:36,570
And you get to see Jujitsu that is on
a level that you almost never see when

1933
01:48:36,571 --> 01:48:39,840
there's, you know, punches
involved and kicks involved.

1934
01:48:39,841 --> 01:48:44,280
So to someone who doesn't know like what
really high level Jujitsu looks like,

1935
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,211
when you,
you know,

1936
01:48:45,211 --> 01:48:48,030
you said you think you kind of have
an idea of what the baseline is.

1937
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:51,840
Well you know, I've seen Anderson Silva
tap out channels, sign it on the ground,

1938
01:48:51,841 --> 01:48:53,110
so I'm pretty sure I
know what you're just,

1939
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:56,520
it looks like you really don't because
the Anderson Silva gets tapped out if he

1940
01:48:56,521 --> 01:48:57,640
goes to Jiu Jitsu tournaments,

1941
01:48:57,930 --> 01:49:00,090
there's a video of him getting
tapped out why he was a champion.

1942
01:49:00,091 --> 01:49:03,780
You got arm barred. And that's
just, that's the way the world man.

1943
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:07,530
He's is another level, the level,
the super, super high level.

1944
01:49:07,531 --> 01:49:09,120
Jujitsu is a,

1945
01:49:09,121 --> 01:49:13,200
it's fucking wild to watch
cause these guys are masters,

1946
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:17,340
then they're ninjas and they're hitting
these high speed moves and countering

1947
01:49:17,341 --> 01:49:22,341
these moves and he can watch guys like
really like technical guys and you're

1948
01:49:22,501 --> 01:49:27,060
watching these wild roles and it's like
Jesus Christ. It's, you know, it's,

1949
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:30,900
it's such a beautiful thing that all of
these arts kinda got a testing ground

1950
01:49:30,901 --> 01:49:34,350
and I wish it could be applied to other
things because just in the way that the

1951
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:39,060
UFC made people take the very best from
everything, the very best from karate,

1952
01:49:39,061 --> 01:49:42,030
the very best from taekwondo, the
very best from Jujitsu, wrestling,

1953
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:43,380
all these different things.
Judo,

1954
01:49:43,381 --> 01:49:47,320
everybody contributed a little piece
to the puzzle. Some pieces way bigger.

1955
01:49:47,321 --> 01:49:48,010
Obviously

1956
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,600
Jujitsu's pieces of the pie was a big
fucking meaty piece of the pot, you know?

1957
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:54,070
But everything had a little point,
you know,

1958
01:49:54,071 --> 01:49:55,730
except for maybe some Weird Kung foods.

1959
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:59,560
It probably contributed maybe only the
tiniest little sliver of something.

1960
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:02,230
I Dunno. But, and then
in life people are still,

1961
01:50:02,231 --> 01:50:05,890
because there isn't that proving ground
with like philosophies and meditation

1962
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:08,320
techniques and Yoga Philosophy,
yoga schools,

1963
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:13,450
they get so rigid in defending their way,
their dogma of what they think.

1964
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:14,740
You know,
this is the only way,

1965
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:18,430
just like martial artists used to be
my Dojo is the only way it's the deadly

1966
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:20,340
arts, blah, blah, blah. You know, it's,

1967
01:50:20,341 --> 01:50:24,670
it's a shame that there isn't some way
to really have that kind of intercourse

1968
01:50:24,671 --> 01:50:29,350
where you test every different skill
and just use what works. But you know,

1969
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:31,630
I think we can do that ourselves anyways.

1970
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:33,220
And I think that's the right philosophy.

1971
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:37,270
Take a little bit from all of
these great religious philosophies,

1972
01:50:37,271 --> 01:50:41,530
these schools of thought, Buddhism,
Zen, Hinduism, Christianity,

1973
01:50:41,531 --> 01:50:44,770
Judaism, Islam, everybody
has a little verse.

1974
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:47,590
Some might be fatter piece of
the pie for you than others,

1975
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:52,000
but everything has some way to contribute
to this and all these other techniques.

1976
01:50:52,001 --> 01:50:55,810
You know, if you'd like
transcendental meditation,
okay, maybe that's a big piece,

1977
01:50:55,811 --> 01:50:59,950
but maybe try some of the other meditation
cycles are, if you like Bikram Yoga,

1978
01:50:59,951 --> 01:51:03,100
okay, that can be a piece. But
try these other things too.

1979
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,880
The same thing needs to be
applied across the fucking board,

1980
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:10,540
but because there's no way for these
people to battle and for people to

1981
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:13,090
ostensibly see it, improve
it, it doesn't happen.

1982
01:51:13,091 --> 01:51:17,170
And you get stuck back in 1970s martial
arts where everybody's defending their

1983
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:20,800
stupid Dojo when really the best
way is a little bit of everything.

1984
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:21,660
Zero lot of them

1985
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:26,390
like a, that sort of a
ideology when it comes to yoga.

1986
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:30,090
Bikram Yoga. It's like that
crazy though. Yeah, he's great.

1987
01:51:30,091 --> 01:51:34,400
He wears gold chain but he's accused of
like a bunch of sexual assaults. No idea.

1988
01:51:34,401 --> 01:51:38,360
I have no personal knowledge of posters
from Amy cause I know that big room yoga

1989
01:51:38,361 --> 01:51:42,860
guy I talked to, the guys did
talk to some guys in front of me.

1990
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:44,720
But yeah,
those guys

1991
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:50,000
so rigid about that being the only way
and it's 18 postures and it's at this

1992
01:51:50,001 --> 01:51:52,820
fucking degree temperature and
everything else is bullshit.

1993
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:57,020
You're like, uh, okay
if you say so. But yeah,

1994
01:51:57,050 --> 01:52:01,570
I kind of like doing some other shit
too. Sexual harassment scandal, rocks,

1995
01:52:01,571 --> 01:52:03,550
Yoga community after beak room.

1996
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,530
The dude's name is bea crumb chewed Hori.
I don't know if I'm saying that right.

1997
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:11,440
It's slapped with a lawsuit and there's a,

1998
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:15,520
apparently the dude drives
Bentleys and shit. Super baller.

1999
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:20,410
He's a super baller.
He seems like he's a handsome guy.

2000
01:52:20,411 --> 01:52:24,250
He's probably gotten mad
yoga pussy because imagine
the yoga pussy that guy gets

2001
01:52:24,251 --> 01:52:28,570
was little speedos on doing stretches
with chicks and it's all about releasing

2002
01:52:28,571 --> 01:52:33,000
and pressure and positions and just
sliding it into your pussy. Oh.

2003
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:37,180
Oh. Look at them there with two hot
chicks. He probably fucked both of them.

2004
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:42,340
He probably did splits and fuck them.
It was he standing on a chicken.

2005
01:52:42,341 --> 01:52:45,740
That one. Yeah. That's insane. Wow.

2006
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:50,090
Let Joey Diaz try that.
I'm not impressed.

2007
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:53,540
I'm impressed with his age though.
The Guy 67 years old,

2008
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:56,810
he's still getting sexual harassment.
That means he's still active.

2009
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:01,580
Congratulations Yoga. It's yoga.
It's like a fucking asshole.

2010
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:05,450
This is the sexy Jurassic
Energy Kundalini.

2011
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:09,020
It's clearly,
he must be a real shit head.

2012
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:12,800
He started beaker him in the early
seventies and now it's turned into this

2013
01:53:12,801 --> 01:53:16,010
gigantic fucking huge movement.
It's really good though.

2014
01:53:16,011 --> 01:53:18,230
That's the problem with Bikram Yoga.
I mean,

2015
01:53:18,231 --> 01:53:21,380
as much of a piece of shit is this guy
may or may not be. I never met him,

2016
01:53:21,381 --> 01:53:25,760
obviously. I mean, who knows these people
who are saying he sexually harass them.

2017
01:53:25,761 --> 01:53:30,720
They can be fucking nuts. I don't
know. But you know the guy, it's,

2018
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:35,300
it's been around. Yeah, it's good.
I mean, but it's a benefit to it.

2019
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:39,230
There's some other really good
hot yoga too. Yeah, it's a lot.

2020
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:40,700
We'll just show somebody
many positions in Yoga.

2021
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:44,540
And the thing about beacons is they have
this very specific routine to the take

2022
01:53:44,541 --> 01:53:47,720
you through this very specific. It's
a fucking great, don't get me wrong.

2023
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:52,310
I love it. I mean it's, it's an amazing,
amazing workout and it's amazing for your,

2024
01:53:52,311 --> 01:53:55,010
your thought process and your mind.
He likes standing on bitches.

2025
01:53:55,011 --> 01:53:59,630
Look at them and that's fucking
weird. And the Christ pose. Yeah. No,

2026
01:53:59,631 --> 01:54:03,900
I think that's warrior one or
something. No, fucking Christ. Suppose

2027
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:09,780
I know warrior one warrior.
I've definitely not snail boy.

2028
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,330
Well you're saying stand on a bitch.
Yeah.

2029
01:54:12,730 --> 01:54:16,550
Hit the Christ pose and fucker
guy looks good for 67 though.

2030
01:54:16,551 --> 01:54:19,460
Man Must be something to that Yoga Shit.
I mean,

2031
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:22,040
I don't know how old these
constantly staring. I checks.

2032
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:26,510
Where's the grossest speedos?
Yeah,

2033
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:30,080
he's like 200 pounds from
looking like a sumo wrestler. No,

2034
01:54:30,081 --> 01:54:31,340
I think he's a tiny guy.

2035
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:34,340
I think this is an illusion because
he's standing on a small woman.

2036
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,400
I think he's already big
at all. You know, he's,

2037
01:54:37,401 --> 01:54:40,510
he's really skinny and super flexible.
I wonder if,

2038
01:54:40,511 --> 01:54:43,940
why doesn't he ever stand on any
dude's rude? They'll kick his ass.

2039
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:46,710
I always eat pounds cause he
doesn't want to fuck to dudes too.

2040
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,850
He stands on you puts a stinky
feet all over your neck.

2041
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:53,060
You're more likely to let them slip his
dick inside you. Is that the way it goes?

2042
01:54:53,061 --> 01:54:57,320
That's what I think in my fantasy world
that I just created with him banging all

2043
01:54:57,321 --> 01:54:59,870
these chicks for real.
I don't know what the real story is.

2044
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:03,470
He says he's disappointed in the false
charges made in this lawsuit but will not

2045
01:55:03,471 --> 01:55:07,250
comment at this time.
I'm disappointed.

2046
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:12,350
That's my bad Indian accent. It sounded
very, very kind of old visual arts movie.

2047
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:16,850
Very vague, very vague
accent. But this, yeah,

2048
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:21,710
I beat from Missoula is a very,
uh, in, you know, very involved.

2049
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:25,700
There's a lot going on with
that whole beat grim movement.
You know, people loved,

2050
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,750
they loved to follow those poses.
Yeah. And you know, and that's,

2051
01:55:29,751 --> 01:55:33,350
and that's fine and that can be a big
fucking piece of your yoga puzzle.

2052
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,180
You liked that. Cool. There's
nothing wrong with that,

2053
01:55:35,181 --> 01:55:38,840
but don't shit on other people who are
finding their own way to do it and maybe

2054
01:55:38,841 --> 01:55:41,750
learn something from them too. And you
know, try that every once in a while.

2055
01:55:41,751 --> 01:55:44,760
Maybe every fucking fourth
session you try something new.

2056
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:48,690
You ever do yoga on pot?
I have. It's really good.

2057
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:53,220
That's actually one of the best physical
activities to do on pod in my opinion,

2058
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,740
is the best to me that in Jujitsu,
but it's,

2059
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:57,970
it's right up there
with Jujitsu because a,

2060
01:55:58,030 --> 01:56:00,930
you feel everything and this
weird super sensitive way,

2061
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:04,560
especially eating it when you eat it
and go through all those yoga movements.

2062
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:07,200
Mckenna believed that,
that turns me cannot believe that.

2063
01:56:07,201 --> 01:56:11,460
That's really what yoga was all about.
He said it was all about how to eat out,

2064
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:12,900
eat cannabis.
Like he,

2065
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:17,640
he believed that he believed that
the or original origins of yoga.

2066
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:22,650
We're like a cannabis optimization.
Uh, exercise makes sense. I mean,

2067
01:56:22,651 --> 01:56:26,520
I naturally, when I smoke or
eat one a stretch generally,

2068
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:29,040
even if I'm not even thinking
about it. Good. It feels good.

2069
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:33,720
And you guys aware of what body,
what's your areas that need work? You,

2070
01:56:33,730 --> 01:56:37,210
you want to stretch. And if my teeth are
dirty, I want to brush my teeth. Yeah.

2071
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,670
Those are the things. Yeah. I feel
like when I got my feet stink,

2072
01:56:39,671 --> 01:56:42,330
I want to get in the shower. Right. Don't
want to be stinky feet when you're hi.

2073
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:43,223
Yeah.
Hey,

2074
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:46,380
pull up that video of the drugs are
getting yelled at because I want to,

2075
01:56:46,381 --> 01:56:48,890
I want to hear that.
You want to hear what was sure.

2076
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:53,750
Because this is not something that would
have even happened a few years ago and

2077
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,770
this is a, this is some new shit
and I'm going to pee because I got,

2078
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,633
I've been drinking

2079
01:56:58,330 --> 01:57:02,510
with all due respect to the
fellows on the other side, uh,

2080
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:03,850
that schizophrenia,

2081
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:07,690
which my father was a psychiatrist
and taught me something about,

2082
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:12,460
could be described as a party that talks
about saving money all the time and

2083
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:16,750
have been concerned with deficits
and being totally driven by that,

2084
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:20,620
but not being concerned and saving money
when people are in jail for marijuana

2085
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:25,800
and mandatory minimums that judges have
said were awful and for nonviolent first

2086
01:57:27,041 --> 01:57:30,250
time offenders who were serving lifetime
sentences and Jay are costing US

2087
01:57:30,251 --> 01:57:35,251
$30,000 a year and to the population of
jails has gone up 800% in the last 30

2088
01:57:35,471 --> 01:57:39,340
years that schizophrenia, you're
concerned about cost and cutting costs,

2089
01:57:39,341 --> 01:57:44,280
but not when it's jailing a population.
Mr about a Cellie, your hands are tied on,

2090
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:48,160
on schedule one,
but it is ludicrous,

2091
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:50,950
absurd,
crazy,

2092
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:52,290
okay

2093
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:55,620
to have marijuana in the
same level as heroin.

2094
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:57,913
Ask

2095
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:02,160
the Light Phillip Seymour
Hoffman if you could.

2096
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:03,790
Okay.

2097
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:05,740
Nobody dies from marijuana.

2098
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:09,160
People die from heroin.

2099
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:15,240
And every second that we spend in this
country trying to enforce marijuana laws

2100
01:58:16,690 --> 01:58:21,690
is a second that we're not
enforcing heroin laws and
heroin and math are the two

2101
01:58:23,201 --> 01:58:26,680
drugs that are ravaging our country.
And every death,

2102
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:28,900
including Mister Hoffman's,

2103
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:32,980
is partly the responsibility of the
federal government to drug power.

2104
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:36,610
These for not putting total
emphasis on the drugs that kill,

2105
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:41,880
that caused people to be addicted and
have to steal to support their habit and

2106
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:46,180
heroin and meth is where all
of your priority should be.

2107
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:50,230
Heroin is getting into
the arms of young people,

2108
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:55,810
and when we put marijuana on the same
level as heroin and LSD and meth and crack

2109
01:58:55,811 --> 01:58:56,650
and cocaine,

2110
01:58:56,950 --> 01:59:00,850
we are telling young people not to listen
to the adults about the ravages and

2111
01:59:00,851 --> 01:59:04,780
the problems and they don't listen
because they know you're wrong.

2112
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:08,500
It's all due respect.
You should be listening to the scientist.

2113
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:12,040
I understand the parents who are grieved
because they're dot child died of an

2114
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:14,890
overdose.
They didn't overdose on marijuana

2115
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:18,970
and you're listening to them
rather than the scientist.

2116
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:23,260
Mr Bata Chelly it may go
back to a few good men,

2117
01:59:23,261 --> 01:59:25,210
the movie Jack Nicholson,

2118
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:31,720
you can't handle the truth.
The truth is the drug war failed.

2119
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:35,350
Your direction on marijuana is a failure.

2120
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:38,003
Get

2121
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:41,330
to dealing and saving kids
from heroin overdoses.

2122
01:59:41,870 --> 01:59:44,880
Now you talked about alcohol and I may,

2123
01:59:44,881 --> 01:59:49,760
you may have gotten to this cirrhosis
of the liver. Pretty serious thing.

2124
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:52,220
Violence against spouses and women.

2125
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:56,540
People don't smoke marijuana and
beat up their wives and girlfriends.

2126
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:58,130
Okay.

2127
01:59:58,130 --> 02:00:01,550
They get drunk. Sometimes they beat
up their wives and girlfriends.

2128
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:05,750
Maybe the reason there's so many more
people smoking marijuana now is cause

2129
02:00:05,751 --> 02:00:08,690
they're not listening and maybe
they're doing the other drugs too,

2130
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,980
but also shows that the drug war has been
a failure. It's been a serious failure.

2131
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:15,930
Okay,

2132
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:19,320
boom. That was an ass kicking. No,
he that this guy from Tennessee,

2133
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:22,260
representative of Tennessee.
Yup.

2134
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:25,200
And you would think like one of the most
conservative states in the country and

2135
02:00:25,201 --> 02:00:28,110
he's a little belt and yeah,
he's old as fuck too. Yeah.

2136
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:32,490
That's fucking positive sign. I like
that. I like it. Well, it's, it's,

2137
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:35,410
it's unavoidable at this point in time.
It's,

2138
02:00:35,610 --> 02:00:40,020
it's gotten to this point where there's
so much information, there's so much,

2139
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:42,000
so many studies have been done.

2140
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:46,530
So much knowledge that there occasionally
they'll throw out a study, uh, you know,

2141
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:50,970
some link to schizophrenia.
If somebody's horse shit,

2142
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:53,190
if there was a link to
schizophrenia and marijuana,

2143
02:00:53,191 --> 02:00:56,730
everybody would be schizophrenia because
everyone's smoking weed. I'm not, I'm,

2144
02:00:56,731 --> 02:00:59,440
I don't mean anything everyone, but I
mean, God damn a lot of people. Yeah.

2145
02:00:59,700 --> 02:00:59,971
You know,

2146
02:00:59,971 --> 02:01:04,971
the thing that's so fucking incredibly
frustrating and infuriating is as part of

2147
02:01:05,581 --> 02:01:07,470
the criteria for scheduled one,

2148
02:01:07,650 --> 02:01:11,490
the drug has to have no
medicinal benefit and oh,

2149
02:01:11,491 --> 02:01:16,491
medicinal benefit and countless fucking
medicinal benefits are being shown by a

2150
02:01:16,951 --> 02:01:18,690
lot of these drugs.
I mean,

2151
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:22,080
the success rate of them testing
things and getting positive results.

2152
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,190
It's only been recent.

2153
02:01:23,191 --> 02:01:27,000
They've been able to get access to things
like siliciden and even the marijuana

2154
02:01:27,001 --> 02:01:28,050
studies that they've been able,

2155
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:31,440
there's still hardly are ever
able to even work with marijuana.

2156
02:01:31,441 --> 02:01:34,590
It's one of the toughest ones to work
with, talking to the people at maps.

2157
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:36,120
But every,
you know,

2158
02:01:36,121 --> 02:01:38,910
they're testing these things and
it's coming back amazingly positive.

2159
02:01:38,911 --> 02:01:39,890
You something like

2160
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:40,431
that.

2161
02:01:40,431 --> 02:01:45,290
Sanjay Gupta completely reversing as
policy because he watched some kid who was

2162
02:01:45,291 --> 02:01:50,180
on 14 fucking pharmaceuticals that were
going to kill her and then she smokes

2163
02:01:50,181 --> 02:01:51,240
weed cause she had epilepsy,

2164
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:56,260
smokes weed that has high CBD and is doing
better than she ever has in her life.

2165
02:01:56,661 --> 02:02:00,500
And he's like, okay, I'm fucking,
I was a Dickhead, I was a doctor.

2166
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:02,420
But now I know what fucking happened.

2167
02:02:02,421 --> 02:02:06,250
Good for him because he was saying a lot
of really dumb shit he fucking switched

2168
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:10,550
is you look at the facts and you can't
help but change your opinion that there

2169
02:02:10,551 --> 02:02:15,080
is medicinal benefit period.
You cannot leave it in that criteria.

2170
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:17,720
It's almost like the perfect question.

2171
02:02:17,930 --> 02:02:21,170
It's almost like how
fucked up is this culture?

2172
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:26,340
We're going to give this culture,
this amazing plant that grows easily,

2173
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:30,570
has no issues with toxicity,
doesn't kill anybody.

2174
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:35,310
Also you can eat it. It provides you
with all the essential amino acids.

2175
02:02:35,311 --> 02:02:40,311
It's very high in protein and you can get
high on it and when you get high on it

2176
02:02:40,530 --> 02:02:43,020
makes you introspective and
makes you more sensitive.

2177
02:02:43,170 --> 02:02:46,770
It makes food actually
taste more delicious.

2178
02:02:46,771 --> 02:02:48,390
It makes sex feel better,

2179
02:02:48,391 --> 02:02:53,391
makes your body feel more sensitive and
it can help you with Glaucoma and it

2180
02:02:54,871 --> 02:02:57,130
makes the best paper and it makes them,

2181
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:59,880
you just run this laundry
list of shit you like.

2182
02:02:59,881 --> 02:03:02,600
There's no way that could be illegal.
It's the most illegal thing.

2183
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:05,040
It's the most illegal
thing in our crazy country.

2184
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:10,430
It's like the perfect question to
find out how insane our society do.

2185
02:03:10,510 --> 02:03:11,940
We have no meter.

2186
02:03:11,970 --> 02:03:16,080
One thing that we can say is the
most beneficial plant on earth.

2187
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:19,740
It's the marijuana plant.
That's the one and that's,

2188
02:03:19,830 --> 02:03:22,440
that's schedule one drug elite.

2189
02:03:22,441 --> 02:03:25,680
The most illegal amongst the
most illegal things you can buy.

2190
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:29,060
It's like at the circus where you hit
that thing with a mallet and it goes all

2191
02:03:29,061 --> 02:03:32,260
the way to the top. That's goes all the
way to the top of the crazy meter. Let's

2192
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:37,180
talk about how nuts it is that that same
drug is also now legal in two states

2193
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:41,950
like the these two. These states have
gotten so fed up Washington and Seattle,

2194
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:44,350
both two of the most awesome
spots in the country.

2195
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:47,230
They've gotten or Washington and Colorado,

2196
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:50,050
they've gotten to this point where
they're like, you know what? Fuck you.

2197
02:03:50,470 --> 02:03:53,620
It's legal. Okay. We say it's
legal in our state. It's legal now.

2198
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:57,250
Yet you could sell it in Colorado.
They're going gangster and Seattle.

2199
02:03:57,251 --> 02:03:59,230
They're like washing Colorado going,
what's gonna happen there?

2200
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:03,400
But in Colorado they just fucking
salad in it, selling it like crazy.

2201
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:04,840
And then the government's like,
yeah,

2202
02:04:04,841 --> 02:04:06,850
well you can't put the
money in the bank then.

2203
02:04:07,150 --> 02:04:11,230
And then eventually they re have
revisited that and said, okay,

2204
02:04:11,231 --> 02:04:14,140
we're going to let people use the banks
because it's so much fucking money.

2205
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:15,370
There's so much money.
Like what?

2206
02:04:15,371 --> 02:04:17,590
You're going to keep that money out of
the bank so the bank fucking failing.

2207
02:04:17,591 --> 02:04:20,020
Don't the banks needed money?
What are you guys doing?

2208
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:23,590
Like you got to this emerging industry
and you better look at it as an industry

2209
02:04:23,591 --> 02:04:25,390
now because now it's proven itself.

2210
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:29,020
They made $1 million in the first fucking
hour when they were selling marijuana

2211
02:04:29,021 --> 02:04:29,561
in Colorado.

2212
02:04:29,561 --> 02:04:33,280
They were just fucking going off and
it's only like 12 stores and one day they

2213
02:04:33,281 --> 02:04:38,010
made 1 million bucks. Yeah. This is, this
is a really encouraging, I mean, I think

2214
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:42,390
once you start to see water pouring
through the damn like this, it's going to,

2215
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:45,690
it's going to break the dam. The more
they resisted and don't go along with it.

2216
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:47,490
It's just going to fucking,
it's gonna crack it.

2217
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:51,070
I mean it's just information excited.
It's too much information. Yeah.

2218
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:54,720
There's too much absolute irrefutable
information. And the, the,

2219
02:04:54,721 --> 02:04:56,700
the cool thing about these states is,
you know,

2220
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:59,520
if you have real good states' rights,

2221
02:04:59,521 --> 02:05:02,040
the ability for states to
regulate a lot of these things,

2222
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:06,900
it's going to be a great way to
ensure that some of these draconian,

2223
02:05:06,901 --> 02:05:10,980
crazy bullshit laws don't get passed
because some states are going to wake up,

2224
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,590
you know,
in this big nationwide consciousness,

2225
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:17,910
it's easier to kind of get enough dummies
circled together from everywhere to

2226
02:05:17,911 --> 02:05:20,760
block something. But you
know, in one state, you know,

2227
02:05:20,761 --> 02:05:24,150
you have a lot of more flexibility
to actually spread information,

2228
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:26,910
create a new kind of vibe
and create new rules.

2229
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:29,760
Like they decided they're not
supposed to be able to do that.

2230
02:05:29,761 --> 02:05:32,070
They're not supposed to be
able to say weed is legal,

2231
02:05:32,071 --> 02:05:34,650
but they just said we're just
fucking doing it. You know,

2232
02:05:34,770 --> 02:05:36,660
I don't care if the
federal laws say you can't,

2233
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:40,770
we're going to do it and maybe you could
come in with the feds and cause trouble,

2234
02:05:40,771 --> 02:05:42,570
but you know we're
going to take that risk.

2235
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:45,870
And I think putting a lot more rights
like that back to the states is,

2236
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:46,793
is the way to go.

2237
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,130
Oh, whatsapp. Absolutely.

2238
02:05:48,470 --> 02:05:51,350
I mean that's the whole reason why the
whole state situation was set up in the

2239
02:05:51,351 --> 02:05:51,801
first place.

2240
02:05:51,801 --> 02:05:56,250
In states rights are supposed to supersede
the federal rights or laws rather.

2241
02:05:56,450 --> 02:05:58,190
We're supposed to
supersede the federal laws.

2242
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:03,400
And I think we're also saying
this overwhelming wave of
information starting to

2243
02:06:03,651 --> 02:06:07,580
shift the way they interact with us
and the way they're forced to deal with

2244
02:06:07,581 --> 02:06:12,581
certain situations when it comes to
world events like Syria for example,

2245
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:18,050
when Obama went on TV and was talking
about military action for Syria,

2246
02:06:18,170 --> 02:06:22,760
the whole world went, Ooh, Ooh,

2247
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:27,950
you want, you have to do what? Why?
Because somebody poisoned people.

2248
02:06:28,010 --> 02:06:29,300
Do you know what you've done?

2249
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:32,000
Do you know a million people are dead
and I racked and many people you'd kill

2250
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:34,820
from drones. It had nothing to do with
the person you were trying to kill.

2251
02:06:35,150 --> 02:06:39,770
Shut the fuck up. No, you don't have
to go to Syria now. It's not important.

2252
02:06:39,771 --> 02:06:41,900
We invade Syria and then they
stopped talking to him about it.

2253
02:06:42,530 --> 02:06:44,870
When was the last time you heard Syria
and the news and that was the last time

2254
02:06:44,871 --> 02:06:46,520
you said Siri on CNN.

2255
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:49,800
When was the last time you saw Syria on
Fox News where they were saying if the

2256
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:53,540
invasions eminent the imminent invasion
of Syria? No, no, no, no. It's all gone.

2257
02:06:53,570 --> 02:06:55,250
People don't want that.
And that's the thing,

2258
02:06:55,251 --> 02:06:58,340
that's another thing that people get
frustrated with how spineless the

2259
02:06:58,341 --> 02:06:59,174
politicians are.

2260
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:02,840
But in another way it's
kind of encouraging and
they really have no fucking

2261
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:06,260
backpack. If we really mount up and
say, no, that's bullshit, don't do that.

2262
02:07:06,430 --> 02:07:10,040
That's for fucking were over. And we do
that in mass like people did for Syria.

2263
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:13,070
They'll just say, okay cool. Cause
they're going to survive too.

2264
02:07:13,071 --> 02:07:17,660
And to survive they have to get elected.
You know? And I know all vote rigging,

2265
02:07:17,661 --> 02:07:21,200
blah, blah, blah. Yeah. All right.
Maybe they push things a little bit,

2266
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:25,760
but if it's fucking in mass, you know
they're going to go along with the tide.

2267
02:07:25,761 --> 02:07:27,290
We just got to create the tide

2268
02:07:27,550 --> 02:07:32,300
and s and make enough motion ourselves
unified that they have to listen.

2269
02:07:32,301 --> 02:07:35,000
And I think we've done that with weed.
It's going to continue.

2270
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:38,440
Keep going that way. And we could do
that with a lot of other shit too. Yeah.

2271
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,510
This is as long as that.
There's truth

2272
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:41,810
and what we're saying.
Yeah.

2273
02:07:41,830 --> 02:07:46,410
In the marijuana truth is something
that seems so impossible and improbable

2274
02:07:46,570 --> 02:07:51,130
cause there's so much from the moment
that it was made illegal from the whole

2275
02:07:51,131 --> 02:07:56,131
conspiracy to make it illegal by a guy
who was at paper manufacturer and own

2276
02:07:56,201 --> 02:07:58,330
newspapers,
William Randolph Hearst.

2277
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:02,590
If you read the story of how
marijuana was made illegal,

2278
02:08:02,591 --> 02:08:05,740
I won't bore you with the details because
I've told it on this podcast too many

2279
02:08:05,741 --> 02:08:08,740
times,
but it's a guy who owned newspapers.

2280
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:12,220
He made a bunch of fucking stories
up and that's how we became illegal.

2281
02:08:12,490 --> 02:08:13,900
And when they made weed illegal,

2282
02:08:13,901 --> 02:08:15,940
they didn't even know they
were making hemp illegal.

2283
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:18,820
Now they recently passed this farm bill.

2284
02:08:18,910 --> 02:08:23,170
Did you see this where they're going
to allow states that make hemp growing

2285
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:25,630
legal to grow it at universities.

2286
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:28,830
So the universities are going to
be allowed to grow hemp. So in a,

2287
02:08:28,831 --> 02:08:33,831
in a way it's sort of making hemp start
to become legal and I don't know if

2288
02:08:34,511 --> 02:08:37,180
that's for commercial application.
I don't,

2289
02:08:37,181 --> 02:08:39,850
I don't know like what they're
going to be able to do with the ham,

2290
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:43,690
but that's even dumber than the weed law.

2291
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:45,940
If you thought the weed law was bad,

2292
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:50,680
this hemp thing is even fucking
crazier because it is legal.

2293
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:54,940
They just can't grow it,
which is so fucking stupid.

2294
02:08:55,290 --> 02:08:55,791
I hear you.

2295
02:08:55,791 --> 02:08:59,870
I'm importing a bunch of hemp over fucking
fucking the Canadian border. Every,

2296
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:03,440
every month we're getting to
the hemp seeds from Canada
because we can't grow it.

2297
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:07,160
Do we have shitty soil? No, we don't
have shitty soil. I show it was great.

2298
02:09:07,161 --> 02:09:11,090
It could grow. We'd like fucking
anybody else in the world, but nope,

2299
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:12,000
we can't do it.

2300
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,030
So many farmers would profit.
So many farmers would benefit.

2301
02:09:15,031 --> 02:09:19,500
Just like you seeing this economic boom
in Colorado because of these people

2302
02:09:19,501 --> 02:09:22,320
being able to sell marijuana.
Look at that pot shops in Denver,

2303
02:09:22,321 --> 02:09:26,040
open door to foreign in
78 $578 million in sales

2304
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:32,370
a year, $578 million. And
that's just the beginning.

2305
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:33,790
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

2306
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:37,440
Those states are going to be
in from the revenue from that.

2307
02:09:38,430 --> 02:09:41,820
They're going to be fucking have
cool public areas and parks and art.

2308
02:09:41,970 --> 02:09:44,940
The states are going to get cooler
and cooler and cooler till finally

2309
02:09:44,941 --> 02:09:48,090
everybody's like, fuck man, we got
to move to one of these cool states.

2310
02:09:48,091 --> 02:09:51,030
They got the best parks,
they've got the best fucking public works,

2311
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:54,480
everything's working smooth cause
they got money and everybody's happy.

2312
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:57,330
And that's what's generally going
to happen in the neighboring states.

2313
02:09:57,331 --> 02:10:00,810
Going to be like, God Damn Colorado's
fucking got it going on. You know,

2314
02:10:00,811 --> 02:10:04,140
and fucking Idaho. I think
I'd know borders Colorado,
right? Idaho's gonna be like,

2315
02:10:04,141 --> 02:10:05,460
well fuck this.
You know,

2316
02:10:05,461 --> 02:10:07,770
we're not going to like Colorado
would be the ones to win,

2317
02:10:07,771 --> 02:10:11,250
so it's going to create this ripple effect
where, you know, I think it's going to,

2318
02:10:11,251 --> 02:10:13,440
it's going to spread.
I fucking love Colorado.

2319
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:18,100
I just love it. I loved that
they were the first, you know,

2320
02:10:18,101 --> 02:10:21,220
the m and Washington state,
but just Colorado is just,

2321
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:25,240
it's such a fucking gangster,
cowboy state, you know? It's like,

2322
02:10:25,241 --> 02:10:30,241
it's such a weird combination of like
western pioneer people who move there and

2323
02:10:30,521 --> 02:10:34,100
really cool people who
stayed, you know? It's like

2324
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:37,430
everybody else was going to California
and the people that stopped in Colorado

2325
02:10:37,431 --> 02:10:40,190
went, we move. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Can we just stay here?

2326
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:43,060
Like why don't we just, why are you
guys going to keep going west man,

2327
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:46,430
do you see how beautiful it is here?
Do you really think over there is better?

2328
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:49,760
I mean, what, what? Come on man.
What's listen, go over there.

2329
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:52,790
Make sure you send me a letter. Tell me
how groovy it is. I'll be right here.

2330
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:54,343
Shirt.

2331
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:59,390
When you find a place that's unbelievably
physically beautiful like Colorado,

2332
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:03,710
I always think that for some reason
that is going to accumulate a lot of

2333
02:11:03,711 --> 02:11:08,450
intelligent and cool people because
there's a benefit in having beauty around

2334
02:11:08,451 --> 02:11:10,730
you. Does the reason why people
spend so much money on art?

2335
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:12,320
Why do people dress so nice?

2336
02:11:12,321 --> 02:11:16,150
Why do people have nice cars is do they
have nice cars to drive or do they have

2337
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:20,090
nice cars to look at? What's not just
to dry? Because if it was just to drive,

2338
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:24,170
every car would look like a rock on the
outside and inside of it would just be

2339
02:11:24,171 --> 02:11:28,910
this, you know, really opulent luxurious
thing that made you feel good as a,

2340
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:31,100
as a passenger. No, you don't.

2341
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:33,380
Most people don't even worry
about what the inside looks like.

2342
02:11:33,381 --> 02:11:34,280
You look on the inside of that car,

2343
02:11:34,281 --> 02:11:36,650
they got fucking Jack in the
box wrappers on the ground,

2344
02:11:37,010 --> 02:11:40,760
fucking empty soda cans and Starbucks
is flopping around their cup holder and

2345
02:11:40,761 --> 02:11:44,030
I'm worried at all but the inside.
But the outside is polished and shiny.

2346
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:47,540
Why is it? Because when you look
at things that are beautiful,

2347
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:50,930
they give you a feeling that give
you a good feeling. That's why,

2348
02:11:51,110 --> 02:11:53,570
you know when you're taking your
woman out and you know you go,

2349
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:56,540
you ready and she's like yeah
and she steps out and you
look at it and like Whoa,

2350
02:11:56,541 --> 02:11:59,480
he looked great. Like Ooh,
this feeling, this law,

2351
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:03,500
this feeling of of observing beauty.
You know, hopefully you do that.

2352
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:04,363
I mean you might be,

2353
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:09,380
might be unfortunate in that regard but
if you are fortunate in that regard,

2354
02:12:09,381 --> 02:12:12,830
if you live in a neighborhood where this
beautiful trees and you see the sunset

2355
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:13,581
and you see it,

2356
02:12:13,581 --> 02:12:16,280
you know poking through these trees
and you look over at the lake and it's

2357
02:12:16,281 --> 02:12:20,030
fucking beautiful and you see a fish
jump and you're like wow, like that.

2358
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:22,670
It's hitting you. It's
energy. There's a lot of,

2359
02:12:22,970 --> 02:12:27,970
and when you live with
that is you probably like a
little on the ball or at the

2360
02:12:28,011 --> 02:12:33,011
very least your inspired by all this stuff
being around you inspired by all this

2361
02:12:33,051 --> 02:12:36,200
beauty of the info. It definitely makes
a difference. You know, you look at,

2362
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:40,040
I think landscape really plays a
bigger part than people give credit.

2363
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:41,060
I mean you look at some of the,

2364
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:45,590
the hardest harshest places and they're
dry as fuck generally. You know,

2365
02:12:45,591 --> 02:12:46,880
like as far as from the,

2366
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:51,860
from a kind of philosophical and religious
and kind of an area that's really

2367
02:12:51,861 --> 02:12:53,240
difficult. You know, some of the,

2368
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,540
some of the worst kind of ID
said it's not always the case,

2369
02:12:56,541 --> 02:13:00,530
but you see a lot in like
really challenging environments
that are really fucked

2370
02:13:00,531 --> 02:13:04,220
up. You get people who are really kind
of obstinate and a lot of their ways that

2371
02:13:04,221 --> 02:13:08,240
thinking where in the really kind of
beautiful regions like Nepal versus China,

2372
02:13:08,241 --> 02:13:10,970
you know, when you're around
that kind of all inspiring,

2373
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:14,790
it's not that often that you
see really crazy, you know,

2374
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:16,220
kind of philosophies that come up.

2375
02:13:16,221 --> 02:13:20,000
I Dunno if it's the people move to that
or whether the environment actually

2376
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:22,480
itself kind of has some impact on,

2377
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:26,510
on the psychology of the people who
live around it. And there's also,

2378
02:13:26,511 --> 02:13:29,630
of course people that go to
areas where there unbelievable,

2379
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:33,660
there's unbelievable beauty and
exploit them. Europeans, you know,

2380
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:36,660
how many people have gone to the
jungle and exploited the Amazon,

2381
02:13:36,860 --> 02:13:40,920
the indigenous people, how many people
have found resources in these strange,

2382
02:13:40,921 --> 02:13:44,560
beautiful places and just fucked
over tribe members? You know,

2383
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:48,660
Mckenna was talking about this, um,
slaughter in the Amazon where a,

2384
02:13:48,661 --> 02:13:49,950
I forget which country,

2385
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:54,180
where they were killing people for
rubber when they found out about rubber.

2386
02:13:54,181 --> 02:13:55,440
It was like in the early,
uh,

2387
02:13:55,500 --> 02:14:00,500
early 20th century and they were going
in there and I'm giving these people like

2388
02:14:00,511 --> 02:14:04,110
you had to have, he had to bring
back this amount of rubber every day,

2389
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:05,123
and if you didn't,

2390
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:09,360
they would cut that amount of weight
that's missing off in human flesh.

2391
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:11,840
So they slaughtered these
people. I mean, they,

2392
02:14:11,841 --> 02:14:14,880
they killed thousands and thousands
of these people. At one point in time,

2393
02:14:15,110 --> 02:14:19,740
you know, they had over a hundred
thousand people in this, in this area,

2394
02:14:19,741 --> 02:14:22,810
and then they were down to just a
couple thousand by the time, um,

2395
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:26,460
whoever the fuck rescued them.
However, this was, uh, stopped.

2396
02:14:26,461 --> 02:14:28,770
I don't recall the entire story,
but this,

2397
02:14:28,771 --> 02:14:33,771
the concept of giving them a quota and
then removing that same amount and flesh,

2398
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:37,720
if they didn't reach that quota,
cutting people's arms off kind of be,

2399
02:14:37,730 --> 02:14:40,320
and doing it in front of everybody
to make sure that these people were

2400
02:14:40,321 --> 02:14:45,321
absolutely terrified to go out and
people are capable of horrible,

2401
02:14:45,361 --> 02:14:49,560
horrible things.
But my point is that when they're not,

2402
02:14:49,561 --> 02:14:53,830
when society stable, when you're not
dealing with that sort of evil invaders,

2403
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:58,470
Mongol invasion type situation,
when you're in a place that's beautiful.

2404
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:01,720
A lot of times the people
there are pretty cool. Yeah. I,

2405
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:05,060
I tend to find the same thing and
it's interesting how, you know,

2406
02:15:05,070 --> 02:15:08,760
some places really do trigger
that over others, you know,

2407
02:15:08,761 --> 02:15:11,160
there's no each communities.
Yeah. Then there's,

2408
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:15,000
you just know when you're in a special
place, you know, I don't know what I,

2409
02:15:15,001 --> 02:15:17,460
the whole beauty concept is interesting,
you know,

2410
02:15:17,461 --> 02:15:21,810
like why is that one place like why
is looking out over the mountains in

2411
02:15:21,811 --> 02:15:25,170
Colorado more beautiful than, you
know, the Cedar Trees in Texas.

2412
02:15:25,171 --> 02:15:29,880
I live in Texas and I'm
never really inspired by the
beauty of the Texas fucking

2413
02:15:29,881 --> 02:15:32,700
hill country. It's nice. I like it.
I love Texas. I love living there,

2414
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:35,910
but it's not the same as when I go to
like a beautiful beach or I go to a

2415
02:15:35,911 --> 02:15:40,320
beautiful mountain or I go even if there's
even beautiful like desert landscapes

2416
02:15:40,321 --> 02:15:41,154
that I've love.

2417
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:45,240
But it's funny how there's something
that just goes and hits the right buttons

2418
02:15:45,241 --> 02:15:47,620
in the brain says this is beautiful.
You know,

2419
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:51,900
they've studied that with people at
people at some form of symmetry and health

2420
02:15:51,901 --> 02:15:54,600
and, but with nature it's
even kind of more curious.

2421
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:58,740
It's just more maybe more like there's
a life force or an order to it.

2422
02:15:58,741 --> 02:16:01,070
I think we like order,
you know,

2423
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:06,380
maybe we're part of that creating force
and when we do that we like to look at

2424
02:16:06,451 --> 02:16:11,130
things that look like they're ordered
and organized by some kind of presence.

2425
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:12,150
I don't know.

2426
02:16:12,150 --> 02:16:15,120
We were also trying to figure out the
other day because one of my sponsors is

2427
02:16:15,121 --> 02:16:16,230
1-800-FLOWERS.

2428
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:21,240
We're trying to figure out why flowers
are so fucking beautiful. I mean,

2429
02:16:21,241 --> 02:16:22,320
what is it about flowers?

2430
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:27,340
What evolutionary advantage is there
to being enthralled by these powerful

2431
02:16:27,901 --> 02:16:30,160
colors to lips and roses.

2432
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:33,790
And it's like, ah, but if you see a
beautiful bouquet of flowers, man,

2433
02:16:33,791 --> 02:16:37,510
there's a feeling that it gives you this
feeling of like admiration of nature's

2434
02:16:37,511 --> 02:16:42,020
artwork that's like, wow, beautiful
thing. And I think for your feeling as a,

2435
02:16:42,021 --> 02:16:44,280
a mountain or something that is Huxley,
Huxley,

2436
02:16:44,510 --> 02:16:48,670
he had an idea that these visions that
you see in the psychedelic experiences

2437
02:16:48,671 --> 02:16:51,010
are generally very colorful environment.

2438
02:16:51,011 --> 02:16:54,790
He did a lot of cactus medicines like
Mescalin and, and things like that.

2439
02:16:54,791 --> 02:16:59,260
And so the colors get really intensely
vibrant and visual and bright.

2440
02:16:59,261 --> 02:17:04,140
And he was saying that we find beautiful,
those things that mimic what we see in,

2441
02:17:04,141 --> 02:17:07,750
in that form of experience. You know,
so like in a DMT trip, you know,

2442
02:17:07,751 --> 02:17:10,690
the colors are out of this
world are Iowasca trip.

2443
02:17:10,691 --> 02:17:14,770
The colors are so vibrant and beautiful
and amazing and they come in a lot of

2444
02:17:14,771 --> 02:17:17,560
these, what the, they actually
call it the chrysanthemum,

2445
02:17:17,561 --> 02:17:22,390
which is named after a flower cause they
come in these kaleidoscopic patterns of

2446
02:17:22,690 --> 02:17:24,520
things that actually
do look like a flower.

2447
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:26,530
So I think there may be
something to that theory,

2448
02:17:26,531 --> 02:17:31,270
maybe in whatever realm beyond that you're
accessing or whatever nether regions

2449
02:17:31,271 --> 02:17:33,280
of your mind.
If you don't want to go to realm beyond,

2450
02:17:33,550 --> 02:17:38,410
there's some ideal of what you see there
and it, and it's looking at a flower,

2451
02:17:38,411 --> 02:17:41,800
like a beautiful Blue
Chrysanthemum reminds you of that.

2452
02:17:41,801 --> 02:17:45,460
Even if it's subliminally and you don't
have had a psychedelic experience that

2453
02:17:45,461 --> 02:17:50,140
triggers whatever you know of some way
back home or some other realm or some

2454
02:17:50,141 --> 02:17:53,260
part of your brain that you don't really
access often. Maybe that's what it is.

2455
02:17:53,261 --> 02:17:56,770
Maybe flowers remind us of psychedelics.
Yeah, that's kind of interesting.

2456
02:17:56,771 --> 02:18:00,070
That's an interesting thought because um,
that's what they call that.

2457
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:05,100
That gateway when you first breakthrough
to DMT and you see that crazy pattern,

2458
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:08,560
they call it the flower of life.
And that that flower of life is,

2459
02:18:08,770 --> 02:18:13,770
is a very common geometric pattern that
exists in a lot of religious artwork,

2460
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:17,270
mosques and things are going to,
and God damn, it's beautiful.

2461
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:21,160
And when you see that you just can't help
but just fucking smile and look like,

2462
02:18:21,161 --> 02:18:25,330
Holy Shit. That's pretty, yeah, and when
you're having a psych, there's a flood.

2463
02:18:25,331 --> 02:18:28,570
It's the, the very rough crude
version of that symbol. But

2464
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:35,110
yeah, you can look up, look up DMT
chrysanthemum or something like that.

2465
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:38,170
That's exactly what you see though. That's
the weirdest thing. It's like when you,

2466
02:18:38,171 --> 02:18:42,230
when you're confronted with these
archetypes that exist in, you know,

2467
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:45,640
somewhat in so many different pieces
of artwork and you see it like right in

2468
02:18:45,641 --> 02:18:50,200
front of your face, just like, whoa.
Like that's so like so classic.

2469
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:55,360
It's a classic image. Like
wow. It's just, it is,

2470
02:18:55,361 --> 02:18:58,370
it is exactly what you've seen that,
you know,

2471
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:00,940
and he said that about gemstones too,
you know?

2472
02:19:00,941 --> 02:19:03,250
And that's why the fascination
with these gemstones,

2473
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:07,390
why are gemstone so valuable? Because
that's really back in the ancient days,

2474
02:19:07,391 --> 02:19:10,840
okay, water kind of reflects,
but there wasn't all this glass.

2475
02:19:10,841 --> 02:19:13,900
And Shit that we created now,
but they would be able to see,

2476
02:19:13,930 --> 02:19:17,020
there'd be able to see something
in that gemstone, you know,

2477
02:19:17,021 --> 02:19:20,100
all the facets and the colors
and the light and they,

2478
02:19:20,101 --> 02:19:23,500
and it was so beautiful to them because
that was something that they could only

2479
02:19:23,501 --> 02:19:27,170
see in there, you know, these visions
or that, that Nether region of the mind.

2480
02:19:27,171 --> 02:19:28,580
So flowers,

2481
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:32,420
gems, all these things that we prize
or actually hearkening back to those,

2482
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:34,640
you know, those visions
that we have. Yeah.

2483
02:19:34,641 --> 02:19:36,800
And for people to think that
it's total complete horseshit,

2484
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:42,100
one of the reasons why they think that
is your brain most certainly produces

2485
02:19:42,291 --> 02:19:44,390
psychedelic drugs.
And they,

2486
02:19:44,391 --> 02:19:48,470
they think that your brain producing
them in large quantities while you're

2487
02:19:48,471 --> 02:19:51,380
dreaming. And so they're, they're
doing some studies on that now.

2488
02:19:51,381 --> 02:19:55,310
And the Cottonwood Research
Foundation, which was where, I'm sorry,

2489
02:19:55,311 --> 02:20:00,230
how about cough drop in my mouth? Doctor
Rick Strassman who wrote the book Dmt,

2490
02:20:00,231 --> 02:20:03,890
the spirit molecule. Um, he was supposed
to be here on the podcast last month,

2491
02:20:03,891 --> 02:20:06,950
but he's such a fucking hippie. It
doesn't even have a cell phone. And a,

2492
02:20:06,951 --> 02:20:10,040
we were exchanging emails,
but it was a UFC weekend and I was gone.

2493
02:20:10,041 --> 02:20:13,010
He hadn't heard from me for a couple of
days because I just don't do my email

2494
02:20:13,011 --> 02:20:15,760
for a couple of them just fucking
busy. Right. And so he thought some,

2495
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:18,590
for some reason, another I had my mind
or something like that. It's crazy.

2496
02:20:18,890 --> 02:20:21,760
They made other plans. I was
like, dude, what's, get a phone?

2497
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:27,710
It'd be so easy to fix that conversation.
You know, I call you, you called me.

2498
02:20:27,711 --> 02:20:30,050
But um, he's in the middle of some, uh,

2499
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,720
some new tests and he's
got a new book coming out,

2500
02:20:32,721 --> 02:20:36,490
so we'll have monsoon for sure. He's a
really cool guy. I really love Rick. Uh,

2501
02:20:36,690 --> 02:20:37,700
but he,
um,

2502
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:43,060
he did some work recently where
they discovered that this is a,

2503
02:20:43,070 --> 02:20:46,760
it's always been the big controversy.
Does DMT m and a from the pineal gland,

2504
02:20:46,790 --> 02:20:51,650
that what is literally your third eye
that in know the center of the brain has

2505
02:20:51,651 --> 02:20:56,480
this eye that this, this thing that in
reptiles actually has a retina and cornea,

2506
02:20:56,770 --> 02:20:58,940
you know,
it's this weird fucking Oregon.

2507
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:04,300
And they were the always hypothesis
hypothesized that DMT had come from there.

2508
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:09,010
That's the seat of the soul and ancient
religions and the bent knee injections.

2509
02:21:09,470 --> 02:21:10,220
Yeah.

2510
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:15,220
Well then they found out
that they actually can prove
it now rats and live rats

2511
02:21:15,231 --> 02:21:19,640
and a live rat, they have gone straight
to the pineal gland and found DMT.

2512
02:21:19,641 --> 02:21:22,550
So they know the DMTs coming out
of the pineal gland of live rats.

2513
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,120
Pretty sure it's coming out of
ours too. Yeah, most likely.

2514
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:30,590
And if that is the case and your brain
does produce this stuff for sure,

2515
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:33,230
it's in Dodgers to the
human body for sure.

2516
02:21:33,231 --> 02:21:37,160
It's produced by the liver and the lungs
and they're pretty sure for sure it's

2517
02:21:37,161 --> 02:21:40,310
produced by the pineal gland and
pretty sure that while you're sleeping,

2518
02:21:40,311 --> 02:21:44,510
that shit's coming out. So one of
the interesting facets of about, um,

2519
02:21:45,350 --> 02:21:49,610
a lot of psychedelic trips, especially
DMT, is that after it's over,

2520
02:21:49,611 --> 02:21:52,250
it's very difficult to
hang on to the memories.

2521
02:21:52,251 --> 02:21:56,630
Like they drift away and they fade away
so quickly. It's like they're so intense.

2522
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:59,990
And then when they're over there,
this lost feeling.

2523
02:22:00,380 --> 02:22:05,380
And I've been really thinking lately
because of my experiences with a Alpha

2524
02:22:06,291 --> 02:22:11,291
brain in an isolation tanks that
there might be something to that with

2525
02:22:12,171 --> 02:22:14,410
psychedelic trips for,
you know,

2526
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:19,220
having a psychedelic trip while you
are really loaded up with nootropics.

2527
02:22:19,460 --> 02:22:23,570
Like we'd have to figure out what is
the optimum blend to give you the most

2528
02:22:23,571 --> 02:22:26,430
clarity in recalling experience.

2529
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:30,450
Yeah. Because just like
a dream, DMT disappears.

2530
02:22:30,930 --> 02:22:34,950
And so the idea is that when
you're asleep, you know,

2531
02:22:34,951 --> 02:22:37,800
we just accept the fact that we
shut off for eight hours a night.

2532
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:42,030
If you're lucky eight hours and
disappear and then wake up and then, oh,

2533
02:22:42,031 --> 02:22:42,990
I've got a crazy dream.

2534
02:22:42,991 --> 02:22:46,320
I was on a skateboard and there was a
missile coming my way or whatever the fuck

2535
02:22:46,321 --> 02:22:50,370
your dream is that that's
about as crazy as it ever got.

2536
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:52,170
But that might not be the case.

2537
02:22:52,171 --> 02:22:57,171
You might be in full blown psychadelic
dream state at several times during the

2538
02:22:57,390 --> 02:23:00,270
night.
Well you are just like a DMT trip,

2539
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:05,510
just like the most intense mushroom trip
with your eyes closed in a dark room.

2540
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:09,480
Like all those things you, you might be
experiencing that on a regular basis.

2541
02:23:09,870 --> 02:23:14,870
And one of my reasons for being inclined
to think that is that every time I've

2542
02:23:15,001 --> 02:23:19,890
done DMT I go,
and not even the the Times now,

2543
02:23:20,370 --> 02:23:24,840
but the times when I first did
it, I go, Oh, I've been here.

2544
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:28,440
I know this place.
Like the very first time I did it,

2545
02:23:28,441 --> 02:23:33,150
I remember that feeling like, Oh, I've
been here before, I know this place.

2546
02:23:33,151 --> 02:23:35,760
Like why do I know this place?
And then I'm back to reality.

2547
02:23:36,820 --> 02:23:40,960
It is a funny, that sense of familiarity
is funny, especially in that, you know,

2548
02:23:41,050 --> 02:23:42,370
cause after a while,

2549
02:23:42,371 --> 02:23:45,790
I guess you could say it's because you've
associated positively from going there

2550
02:23:45,791 --> 02:23:48,310
during the trip before,
but it really feels like,

2551
02:23:48,311 --> 02:23:50,700
it feels like another type of home,
you know,

2552
02:23:50,710 --> 02:23:54,010
where you're just in a place
that's really beautiful.

2553
02:23:54,011 --> 02:23:56,860
It's communicating in a new
way, you know, they can't,

2554
02:23:57,250 --> 02:24:00,280
sometimes words come through
through beings and things like that,

2555
02:24:00,281 --> 02:24:04,690
but really it's just some
kind of information is
splashing against this force

2556
02:24:04,691 --> 02:24:08,770
field that we have in the
mind and creating these
beautiful colors and passing

2557
02:24:08,771 --> 02:24:13,390
along information in some code that we
can't quite decipher, but we know it,

2558
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:16,680
you know, and we know something
about that message and it's,

2559
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:18,040
it's a fucking beautiful place.

2560
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:22,140
It also seems to know that you're not
supposed to be there while your conscious

2561
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:25,770
and so it's trying to give you some
information while you're there. It's,

2562
02:24:25,771 --> 02:24:26,670
it seems like,

2563
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:30,600
like I've always felt like when I've
done DMT that while it's happening,

2564
02:24:30,601 --> 02:24:34,230
they're like, well can you do in
here? Oh look at you. You're here.

2565
02:24:34,231 --> 02:24:37,860
What are you here? You're here now.
So as almost like consciousness,

2566
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:39,090
like being conscious,

2567
02:24:39,091 --> 02:24:42,840
being a person who is awake and turning
on your television and hitting your

2568
02:24:42,841 --> 02:24:47,841
keyboard is a mode that you're not
supposed to operate that dimension with.

2569
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:50,970
So you're sort of tricking the universe.

2570
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:54,690
When you introduced that
dimension to a conscious mode,

2571
02:24:55,050 --> 02:24:56,940
it's like the conscious mode is like,

2572
02:24:56,941 --> 02:25:00,690
what the fuck is this all you
don't remember? You don't know.

2573
02:25:00,691 --> 02:25:04,350
You all know you don't know.
And then you're like, why
do I know this place? Like,

2574
02:25:04,351 --> 02:25:07,990
Oh, you don't know. You don't
know why you know it. We love you.

2575
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:11,250
That's one of the things
I'll never forget.

2576
02:25:11,251 --> 02:25:16,140
I had one really intense experience
and they're going, we love you.

2577
02:25:16,230 --> 02:25:20,550
600 million, 500,000 times. Look at
this. And it kept saying, look this.

2578
02:25:20,820 --> 02:25:22,050
And every time it would say,
look at this,

2579
02:25:22,051 --> 02:25:23,980
it would show me something like insanely

2580
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:26,650
crazy, beautiful, impossibly beautiful.

2581
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:30,550
And then the next time it would be like
a million times more beautiful than that.

2582
02:25:30,551 --> 02:25:32,950
Like you thought that was as
beautiful as it yet, look at this.

2583
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:36,850
They would show me something else.
Crazy was, I love you 600 million,

2584
02:25:36,851 --> 02:25:38,620
500,000 times.
Look at this,

2585
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:42,570
you know, all of the, I've been really
amazed. People think when you encounter,

2586
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:46,230
you know, some kind of entities or beings,
they're going to be real boring. Like,

2587
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:49,050
Whoa, hello, welcome to my realm.

2588
02:25:49,230 --> 02:25:52,530
Every time that I've communicated with
any kind of spirit form and one of these

2589
02:25:52,531 --> 02:25:57,240
trips there can, they can be
funny. They're interesting.
They're vibrant, you know?

2590
02:25:57,241 --> 02:26:01,840
It's like, it's not what you think your
dad. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's like they,

2591
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:06,550
they have a sense of humor. It's, it's
really interesting how that is, you know,

2592
02:26:06,890 --> 02:26:10,050
we were so ridiculous in our
ideas of how the world should be,

2593
02:26:10,051 --> 02:26:14,010
how rigid scholars and learned
people are supposed to be. You know,

2594
02:26:14,011 --> 02:26:15,810
we have this idea that you, if you, yeah,

2595
02:26:15,811 --> 02:26:19,530
if you have knowledge and
wisdom and experience and
if you're somehow or another

2596
02:26:19,531 --> 02:26:24,420
quote unquote enlightened, then you're
going to be like bland and flat. Yeah, no,

2597
02:26:24,421 --> 02:26:29,050
totally. You know, it reminds me, so one
of the, the third experience I did in,

2598
02:26:29,060 --> 02:26:33,510
in New Mexico, I came back and my next up
on the, on the path after the snuffing,

2599
02:26:33,511 --> 02:26:36,660
the five Meo DMT was a
mushroom and Syrian rue trip.

2600
02:26:37,110 --> 02:26:40,710
And they call that Anna Wasco because
just a candy flipping motherfucker down.

2601
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:45,380
I just did what did, what, what the, did
what the, you know, the woman said, uh,

2602
02:26:45,730 --> 02:26:49,740
and this was up on the menu.
This is my next fucking wow journey.

2603
02:26:49,741 --> 02:26:53,640
So they call it Ana Wasco because
it's something of an Iowa Ska analog,

2604
02:26:53,670 --> 02:26:57,810
even though it's not DMT based mushrooms
and Syrian Rue create that. Well,

2605
02:26:58,110 --> 02:27:02,250
mushrooms are five, four locks [inaudible]
trip to tryptamine. Oh really? Yeah.

2606
02:27:02,251 --> 02:27:05,310
That's what psilocybin is.
Psilocybin is, is, yeah,

2607
02:27:05,311 --> 02:27:09,270
it's Dmt plus something else.
Very interesting.

2608
02:27:09,271 --> 02:27:13,440
One of the more fascinating things about
mushrooms itself and then Syrian rue is

2609
02:27:13,441 --> 02:27:14,460
a powerful Maoi.

2610
02:27:14,461 --> 02:27:18,700
So it's like come kind of combining the
same two forces that are in, yeah. Let me,

2611
02:27:18,701 --> 02:27:21,170
Alaska Bruce, I've said it
before and I've said it wrong.

2612
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:26,190
Let me find out. So how do you
spell silicide? P, s I. L. O. C y.

2613
02:27:26,310 --> 02:27:30,620
B. I. N. C. Y. B. I n. Um,

2614
02:27:30,990 --> 02:27:35,910
either Silverson or psilocybin is
the, uh, the, the actual, yeah,

2615
02:27:35,911 --> 02:27:39,030
here it is. Die. Oh boy.

2616
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:41,720
Yeah,

2617
02:27:41,720 --> 02:27:46,140
I can't pronounce that.
Okay.

2618
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:47,670
What the point is,

2619
02:27:47,940 --> 02:27:50,580
forget about all the science
behind because obviously
I shouldn't be distributed

2620
02:27:50,581 --> 02:27:54,060
at, there's Psilocybin, it's Scilla
sin. What's, which one is Tillison.

2621
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:58,410
So Allison has also, um, I don't know,
maybe some other active compound.

2622
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:03,640
Yeah. Yeah. So awesome. Um,

2623
02:28:04,450 --> 02:28:04,860
yeah,

2624
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:09,010
is another one that's like really
close to a human neuro transmitters.

2625
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:13,200
These things are, they're just
there. They're super close there.

2626
02:28:13,201 --> 02:28:17,850
They're super close to things that the
human brain already has in it. Yup.

2627
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:23,780
So, so anyways, I do this and in
Wasco trip and it was, you know,

2628
02:28:23,790 --> 02:28:25,190
I never done Iowasca at that point.

2629
02:28:25,191 --> 02:28:29,660
It was my third psychedelic experience
and this one was completely different.

2630
02:28:29,661 --> 02:28:33,950
And in this one I was very much like
some of the Iowasca stories I told.

2631
02:28:33,951 --> 02:28:38,951
I was riding on the back of a Cobra and
this Cobra was in the jungle and I'm in

2632
02:28:39,051 --> 02:28:42,440
the fucking desert. Mexico mountains
here. There's no jungle anywhere.

2633
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:46,610
So the fact that I was in a jungle
was incredibly odd to me anyways,

2634
02:28:46,611 --> 02:28:50,990
but I'm riding on the head of this
Cobra and the back of a jungle and I'm

2635
02:28:50,991 --> 02:28:55,991
talking with my grandmother who was like
somehow imbued in the spirit of this,

2636
02:28:56,600 --> 02:28:59,090
of this Cobra.
And she was still alive by the way,

2637
02:28:59,091 --> 02:29:02,240
which is another interesting facet.
But anyway,

2638
02:29:02,241 --> 02:29:06,350
so she's imbued in the spirit of this
Cobra and I'm dipping down in the earth

2639
02:29:06,351 --> 02:29:10,220
and much like the Iowasca visions, I'm
having bugs come inside me and explode.

2640
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:13,060
And meanwhile I'm laid out on my back and,
um,

2641
02:29:13,420 --> 02:29:15,980
I'm shivering and I'm kind
of lifting my chest up.

2642
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:18,770
And I must've looked kind
of crazy to the Shama,

2643
02:29:18,771 --> 02:29:22,430
but she must've been kind of used to it
cause I sweating profusely and I needed

2644
02:29:22,431 --> 02:29:22,911
blankets.

2645
02:29:22,911 --> 02:29:27,410
I was cold and I'm shivering and I'm
going through this and this really intense

2646
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:32,450
vision. But all the while, my
grandfather, who's Aubrey, my grandfather,

2647
02:29:32,451 --> 02:29:35,150
Aubrey's out on these rocks and you know,

2648
02:29:35,151 --> 02:29:38,300
in a whole different environment
and he's just laughing,

2649
02:29:38,301 --> 02:29:42,650
like laughing so warmly and like
kindly cause he's saying, oh,

2650
02:29:42,651 --> 02:29:44,270
you're really going through it now.

2651
02:29:44,300 --> 02:29:48,860
Oh she's going to take you down there
into the dirt. And he how with laughter.

2652
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:51,740
And he was so happy and
joyous about doing it.

2653
02:29:51,741 --> 02:29:55,580
I've never met my grandfather robbery.
He was so happy and joyous about it.

2654
02:29:56,210 --> 02:29:59,270
That experience that I started laughing
too because I thought it was hilarious.

2655
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:04,130
Even though spiders or like going into
my eyes and exploding and I'm riding on

2656
02:30:04,131 --> 02:30:07,850
the snake and I have no control and
I'm dipping down into the earth and I'm

2657
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:11,540
expelling this sweat. And you
know, Aubrey's just laughing.

2658
02:30:11,541 --> 02:30:14,870
So I'm laughing and it was
this whole wild experience.

2659
02:30:14,871 --> 02:30:19,871
But the thing that impressed me the
most was just how vibrant and happy it

2660
02:30:19,971 --> 02:30:24,050
wasn't. Like, you know, you
see these mediums and it's
all so somber and serious.

2661
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:27,260
Aubrey says to say,
you know,

2662
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:30,980
good luck in your next Algebra test,
or I don't know what the fuck it was,

2663
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:33,200
but he was just happy as shit,
you know?

2664
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:35,890
And that was the kind
of experience that you,

2665
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:38,390
that I tend to find when I
encounter these entities,

2666
02:30:38,391 --> 02:30:42,710
but either family or these other things,
it's really, they're full of life.

2667
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:45,230
They're almost that
version in its best self.

2668
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:47,060
That's also what you're
looking for though.

2669
02:30:47,490 --> 02:30:50,150
You're looking for love and you're
looking for them to be full of life.

2670
02:30:50,151 --> 02:30:53,570
So if you really are creating the
university inside your own mind,

2671
02:30:53,870 --> 02:30:58,010
that's what you as a positive person
seeking positive experiences would create

2672
02:30:58,130 --> 02:31:01,880
that to create your, all of your
relatives being super cool. Yeah,

2673
02:31:02,410 --> 02:31:06,200
it's absolutely true. This is what a
Rick Strassman by the way said silicide.

2674
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:10,340
This is how he explained siliciden that
psilocybin the active ingredient in

2675
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:13,550
magic mushrooms, uh, after being ingested,

2676
02:31:13,551 --> 02:31:18,050
the body removes phosphorous atoms
from the silicide been converting it to

2677
02:31:18,051 --> 02:31:20,280
Scilla sin.
Sin Listen differs

2678
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:24,880
from dimethyltryptamine Dmt by one oxygen,
uh,

2679
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:27,720
that silicide Silverson eh,

2680
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:32,580
he likes to think of it as orally active
DMT. That's Rick Strassman's take on it.

2681
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:35,130
So that's what,
that's the,

2682
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:40,190
the definition very interested in
it's silicon is the, uh, that's the,

2683
02:31:40,191 --> 02:31:44,180
the active, that's what happens when
you, when you take it that it's, uh,

2684
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:49,390
it's four h o d m t
silicide or silicon or it's,

2685
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:52,770
it's spelled a bunch of different cause
this, cause this really was pretty much,

2686
02:31:52,771 --> 02:31:57,450
and I lost a trip that I went on.
The differentiators are very,

2687
02:31:57,750 --> 02:31:59,640
you know, it's very
similar. It makes sense.

2688
02:31:59,641 --> 02:32:02,310
I mean if you're taking him
Mao inhibitor and mushrooms,

2689
02:32:02,311 --> 02:32:06,450
I've heard people have horrendous
trips taking pharmaceutical,

2690
02:32:06,510 --> 02:32:08,190
Mao inhibitors and mushrooms.

2691
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:12,750
I imagine these mean cause they're
intensely powerful Mao inhibitors.

2692
02:32:12,751 --> 02:32:16,280
Like if you take a mild Mao
inhibitor, like say harming, you know,

2693
02:32:16,290 --> 02:32:19,490
and compare it and that's what's
in Syria and yeah. Harmfully yeah.

2694
02:32:19,650 --> 02:32:21,120
And by the way,
harming when they first,

2695
02:32:21,121 --> 02:32:24,910
this was really crazy when
they first found it, they
wanted to call it telepathy,

2696
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:31,050
but they couldn't because they didn't
realize that when they discovered it by

2697
02:32:31,051 --> 02:32:33,690
use of these, uh, the IOWASCA showman,

2698
02:32:33,870 --> 02:32:37,140
they didn't understand that it had
already been discovered that the,

2699
02:32:37,141 --> 02:32:39,750
the chemical component
of it already had a name.

2700
02:32:39,751 --> 02:32:41,120
So they couldn't call it telepathy.

2701
02:32:41,160 --> 02:32:43,950
But that was what they were inclined
to call it because these people were

2702
02:32:43,951 --> 02:32:47,400
tripping their balls out and having
these fucking telepathic experiences.

2703
02:32:47,401 --> 02:32:52,110
Shared experiences. Yeah. The problem is
you can't document them. You know, you're,

2704
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:55,740
you're freaking the fuck out. You know,
you know, but you can't show anybody.

2705
02:32:56,010 --> 02:33:00,450
He was like, man, your bullshit and
try this and they take it. Okay,

2706
02:33:00,451 --> 02:33:02,710
what are we getting maintenance?
How about telepathy?

2707
02:33:03,910 --> 02:33:08,100
What a bunch of scientists decided to
name something telepathy. Holy Shit.

2708
02:33:08,130 --> 02:33:09,750
You know what,
what are you taking?

2709
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:13,590
And the reason why we don't know about
this folks is not because people are

2710
02:33:13,591 --> 02:33:14,220
dying.

2711
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:17,610
The reason why we don't know about this
is because we've been denied by our

2712
02:33:17,611 --> 02:33:21,000
daddies.
Buy Our daddy overlords are government.

2713
02:33:21,001 --> 02:33:26,001
And they've kept these intensely powerful
and hugely beneficial to some folks.

2714
02:33:26,250 --> 02:33:28,800
Hugely beneficial experiences.
Kept them from us.

2715
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:30,260
Yeah,
absolutely.

2716
02:33:30,290 --> 02:33:35,290
And you can only imagine how many cool
ways and places in the knowledge that was

2717
02:33:35,301 --> 02:33:35,840
out there.

2718
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:38,990
I mean I'm very fortunate I was able to
go with someone who had been doing this,

2719
02:33:38,991 --> 02:33:43,010
leading people on these journeys for
20 years, you know, and had experience,

2720
02:33:43,011 --> 02:33:46,670
no new kind of the properties of
what to do, knew what to mix new,

2721
02:33:46,671 --> 02:33:49,370
the amounts to do it.
And so I could just really trust.

2722
02:33:49,550 --> 02:33:52,280
But it gets sketchy if you're trying
to trying to figure this stuff out.

2723
02:33:52,281 --> 02:33:56,090
That's why I always recommend people go
with a guide or someone who knows what

2724
02:33:56,091 --> 02:33:58,580
to do. And those are sometimes
hard to find, you know?

2725
02:33:58,581 --> 02:34:03,200
And that's why the only thing I recommend
now is going to some places where I've

2726
02:34:03,201 --> 02:34:06,830
been in Peru and to do Iowasca
so I can trust the, the Shaman,

2727
02:34:06,831 --> 02:34:10,840
the Pearson to meister leading
the ceremony. I can trust
the medicine cause it's,

2728
02:34:10,870 --> 02:34:11,090
you know,

2729
02:34:11,090 --> 02:34:15,260
there's a lot of iffy stuff and that's
another byproduct of making it illegal.

2730
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:18,070
No,
it's because you're forced to make some

2731
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:21,970
challenging choices, both risking
legality, which sucks. You know,

2732
02:34:21,971 --> 02:34:26,320
you don't want to wind up in a fucking
cage, you know, or your choice, you know,

2733
02:34:26,321 --> 02:34:30,250
forced to deal with something that you
don't know the exact properties of where

2734
02:34:30,251 --> 02:34:31,630
you don't know kind of
what you're getting into.

2735
02:34:31,631 --> 02:34:34,390
So it's a lot hairier of a situation.

2736
02:34:34,790 --> 02:34:38,930
Yeah. And you, if you're a person
who has a job that you like,

2737
02:34:38,931 --> 02:34:42,690
you want to keep that job. You
know, you don't want to be fired.

2738
02:34:42,691 --> 02:34:45,740
Do you want to be outcasts? Do you want
to make sure you make your mortgage?

2739
02:34:45,741 --> 02:34:48,500
You want to keep feeding your family
and then they're gonna Piss test you.

2740
02:34:49,070 --> 02:34:51,290
Oh God.
That's what's really crazy.

2741
02:34:51,291 --> 02:34:55,820
It's like you could smoke pot on Friday
night when you get home from work and if

2742
02:34:55,821 --> 02:34:59,540
they piss test you on Monday,
you're stone cold sober.

2743
02:34:59,810 --> 02:35:01,040
You're showing up for work.

2744
02:35:01,570 --> 02:35:06,320
Clearheaded Caba coffee newspaper
in your arm and they're like, Bob,

2745
02:35:06,321 --> 02:35:09,560
we'd like to see you pee into this cup.
Please. Like, what are you talking about?

2746
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:13,490
What'd you do this weekend? We own you.
We own your body weight on your body.

2747
02:35:13,550 --> 02:35:18,110
Did you do something illegal
this weekend, Bob? No, no, no.
Not at all. Oh, you didn't?

2748
02:35:18,140 --> 02:35:22,760
Hmm. We don't have a medical
marijuana. Not Federally. Federal.

2749
02:35:22,761 --> 02:35:25,250
You don't federal, you don't federally,
it's illegal. So pee in the cup.

2750
02:35:25,580 --> 02:35:27,530
And not only that,
we're going to impose our own laws.

2751
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:30,680
We don't want you smoking cigarettes
because that's bad for your health.

2752
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:32,000
We don't smell.
You know what I mean?

2753
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:34,670
Fucking healthcare programs keep
you from smoking cigarettes.

2754
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:38,630
They can tell you to do that. They
could tell you to not smoke marijuana.

2755
02:35:38,631 --> 02:35:39,171
They can tell you,

2756
02:35:39,171 --> 02:35:41,870
you can't do mushrooms that can tell
you know cocaine in your system.

2757
02:35:41,890 --> 02:35:45,350
You did the fucking, they own you. Not
from nine to five, Monday through Friday.

2758
02:35:45,570 --> 02:35:47,420
They own you on Saturday and Sunday too.

2759
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:50,180
They own you 24 seven if
you want to work for ups.

2760
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:55,220
So brutal. They Test Your pee. Yeah.
Yeah. And then that whole idea,

2761
02:35:55,221 --> 02:35:58,550
if they really were out there for your
benefit and locking you up was for your

2762
02:35:58,551 --> 02:36:00,560
benefit.
They'd lock up all the fat people.

2763
02:36:00,561 --> 02:36:03,080
They'd lock up all the cigarette smokers.
They'd lock up.

2764
02:36:03,081 --> 02:36:06,170
Everybody doing any bad duck
dynasty would go right off the air.

2765
02:36:06,450 --> 02:36:08,420
At first they locked
up all the fat people.

2766
02:36:08,421 --> 02:36:11,720
Do you know how bad their ratings would
drop the fucking right through the floor.

2767
02:36:12,110 --> 02:36:15,830
It'd be like a sinkhole opened up right
under duck dynasty. Same fucking thing.

2768
02:36:15,831 --> 02:36:19,340
Obviously obesity kills you
eventually and it kills you faster,

2769
02:36:19,341 --> 02:36:21,710
way faster than that.
If it's doing it for your own good,

2770
02:36:21,711 --> 02:36:25,130
you should lock up all the fucking
fat people, but that's insane.

2771
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:29,660
So they don't do it, but
it's just as insane with our
locking people up for, yeah,

2772
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:33,350
we don't need a daddy. Stupid. Yup. And
you're not smart enough to be my daddy.

2773
02:36:33,530 --> 02:36:38,090
Dumb. Fuck, that's, that's
our real problem, man.

2774
02:36:38,091 --> 02:36:42,350
We got a bunch of fucking unenlightened
people that are set in the rules and

2775
02:36:42,351 --> 02:36:47,090
we're making it so you can't have these
enlightening experiences and be a guy

2776
02:36:47,091 --> 02:36:49,340
that sets the rules.
Because if you are,

2777
02:36:49,580 --> 02:36:51,680
well then we discredit
you because you're a guy.

2778
02:36:51,681 --> 02:36:55,190
Like we found out that Obama was going
these shamonic trips and doing mushrooms.

2779
02:36:55,460 --> 02:37:00,260
We'd be like, what can I get that
fucking guy out of there? Not Us, not us,

2780
02:37:00,261 --> 02:37:04,170
but America, the right. You
imagine how fucking Hannity,

2781
02:37:04,550 --> 02:37:09,110
those shitheads fucking that Sean
Hannity type dudes. Meanwhile,

2782
02:37:09,111 --> 02:37:11,860
it should be the criteria for leading
our goddamn country. You should,

2783
02:37:11,861 --> 02:37:15,410
you shouldn't be able to be president
unless you done mushrooms at least once.

2784
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:16,100
The Shit

2785
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:17,360
you shouldn't be allowed
to and you should,

2786
02:37:17,570 --> 02:37:20,990
you should have a videotape or you doing
mushrooms so we could prove it like

2787
02:37:20,991 --> 02:37:23,150
this is the mushrooms.
Like it should be like,

2788
02:37:23,860 --> 02:37:26,720
I need to know you did a big
dose more than four grams. Right?

2789
02:37:26,810 --> 02:37:30,470
I want to see you get fucking blown out
in the center of the universe and then

2790
02:37:30,530 --> 02:37:34,670
crawl back home. You know,
like really? That's what I
want to say it. If you don't,

2791
02:37:34,671 --> 02:37:36,530
if you'd never done that man,
that we're,

2792
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:40,640
we're having some weird conversation
here because everybody who has done that

2793
02:37:40,670 --> 02:37:45,620
agrees separate red band was
fucking can't trust that he's done.

2794
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:48,260
He doesn't think it does anything,
but that's him.

2795
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:52,640
But everybody else that I know that
has had like a blown out breakthrough

2796
02:37:52,670 --> 02:37:56,300
psychedelic experience,
they believe that it changes lives.

2797
02:37:56,301 --> 02:38:00,620
They believe that it enhances
your personality. It gives
you a new perspective,

2798
02:38:00,830 --> 02:38:05,060
gives you a new way to look at the world
and is probably hugely beneficial to

2799
02:38:05,061 --> 02:38:08,900
your growth as a human being.
But the people that don't,

2800
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:12,200
they're the ones who judge it, that
people that haven't had that experience,

2801
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:15,140
they're the ones who come out against him,
which is so crazy.

2802
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:19,970
It's like blind people getting pissed
that you're looking at things. It's like,

2803
02:38:19,971 --> 02:38:22,730
what are you doing? You're looking
at shit. No, no, no, no, no.

2804
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:26,240
I don't trust what you're seeing. What's
right fucking in front of you, man.

2805
02:38:26,241 --> 02:38:30,950
The lake's right there says, Ooh. Says
you it crazy person using your eyes.

2806
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:33,020
That's really what,

2807
02:38:33,021 --> 02:38:36,800
it's almost like someone who hasn't had
a psychedelic experience trying to tell

2808
02:38:36,801 --> 02:38:41,060
you that it's bad for you or that you
shouldn't do it. It's like, are you sure?

2809
02:38:41,390 --> 02:38:44,570
Okay. Because I'm okay.
Not only am I okay,

2810
02:38:44,571 --> 02:38:48,590
but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be this
guy if it wasn't for those experiences.

2811
02:38:49,220 --> 02:38:53,180
And, um, you're a silly
bitch and you're telling me,

2812
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:56,730
you're telling me what to do
based on nonsense. I think I,

2813
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:59,860
I think I'm going with my instincts here.
I think I'm going to,

2814
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:02,230
I'm going counterculture on Ya.
I'm going counter on a

2815
02:39:02,230 --> 02:39:02,600
culture.

2816
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:06,520
There's so many forces that are pushing
us away from being conscious and away

2817
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:07,311
from being awake.

2818
02:39:07,311 --> 02:39:10,910
That whole little mini rant you did about
what goes through your daily life from

2819
02:39:10,911 --> 02:39:14,420
the phones. So this honk. So
the work, all of this stuff,

2820
02:39:14,510 --> 02:39:16,610
it's not like it was back in the old days,

2821
02:39:16,611 --> 02:39:20,390
you know back in the old days maybe you
could walk your bare feet on the ground

2822
02:39:20,391 --> 02:39:23,540
and you were pretty connected and
you didn't need to take these massive

2823
02:39:23,541 --> 02:39:24,170
psychedelic trips,

2824
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:27,290
although they probably did and fucking
loved it all throughout all cultures.

2825
02:39:27,740 --> 02:39:28,880
But that's besides the point,

2826
02:39:28,881 --> 02:39:32,960
it wasn't maybe as necessary but
now in this crazy weird world,

2827
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:35,330
it's so much easier to get off track.

2828
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:38,650
You know and you look on TV
and it's really frustrate.

2829
02:39:38,651 --> 02:39:42,980
I get really physically
antsy and frustrated when I
go somewhere and they have

2830
02:39:42,981 --> 02:39:47,270
like real housewives on TV
cause it's like so visible.

2831
02:39:47,271 --> 02:39:52,271
The unconsciousness that's going on in
this drama that's all nonsensically ego

2832
02:39:52,401 --> 02:39:56,690
based and all of this shit that's being
kind of pushed out and it's filtering

2833
02:39:56,691 --> 02:39:58,970
through our consciousness.
And then you know,

2834
02:39:58,971 --> 02:40:01,520
to ban the only thing that can really,

2835
02:40:01,730 --> 02:40:05,120
we're not the only thing but one of
the most powerful tools to realign you.

2836
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:09,140
It's just a, it's a recipe for fucking
disaster. And it's where we are. Yes.

2837
02:40:09,290 --> 02:40:12,380
It's one of the things that makes
life so interesting though because

2838
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:14,010
unfortunately,

2839
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:15,240
because look,

2840
02:40:15,310 --> 02:40:20,010
I like to talk a good game and I love it
if everybody was enlightened, but man,

2841
02:40:20,011 --> 02:40:21,360
it wouldn't be as fun. One, uh,

2842
02:40:21,610 --> 02:40:24,300
one of the things that's
fun about life is that the,

2843
02:40:24,301 --> 02:40:27,180
there are a bunch of crazy fucks
out there that don't get it.

2844
02:40:27,450 --> 02:40:32,270
And that when you do find people who do
get it, whatever, get it means you're,

2845
02:40:32,271 --> 02:40:33,720
you're appreciate them so much more.

2846
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:37,500
It's like you really don't appreciate
the light until you see the dark.

2847
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:41,070
You really don't appreciate. Cool. And
See, hanging out with Douchey. You don't,

2848
02:40:41,100 --> 02:40:45,810
you know, you don't appreciate generosity
until you meet a few cons. You know,

2849
02:40:46,180 --> 02:40:48,690
and that's, it's
unfortunate, but that's real.

2850
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:53,580
That's one of the things
that makes mushrooms so
beautiful is that people don't

2851
02:40:53,581 --> 02:40:54,390
know.

2852
02:40:54,390 --> 02:40:58,710
And when you do hit me like how is
this possible that this is illegal?

2853
02:40:58,820 --> 02:41:02,190
How is this possible? This is
an on CNN. How is this possible?

2854
02:41:02,191 --> 02:41:06,690
The front page of the New York Times
doesn't say stop everything and do

2855
02:41:06,691 --> 02:41:11,490
mushrooms. Stop what you're doing.
Stop everything. Stop making laws,

2856
02:41:11,550 --> 02:41:16,050
stopped doing the stock market.
Everybody should do mushrooms. Holy Shit.

2857
02:41:16,230 --> 02:41:17,940
That should be the front
page of the New York Times.

2858
02:41:18,390 --> 02:41:21,690
Stop what you're doing and do mushrooms.
They were,

2859
02:41:21,740 --> 02:41:26,340
if they really wanted to give you news,
life changing news, that's the real news.

2860
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:30,120
It's, it's, it's the life changing.
News is not Justin Bieber got arrested.

2861
02:41:30,330 --> 02:41:31,860
That's not the life changing news.

2862
02:41:32,220 --> 02:41:35,610
Life changing news is there's
these mushrooms that grow,

2863
02:41:35,670 --> 02:41:39,750
they grow on cow shit and if you
take them, that might be what God is.

2864
02:41:40,740 --> 02:41:44,490
Bieber if you're listening, I can take
you down to Peru with this from my Alaska.

2865
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:49,740
He's young.
He's about 1819 so whenever he's ready,

2866
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:54,240
he's ready. You or I would be dead
if we were that kid. He's lucky.

2867
02:41:54,241 --> 02:41:58,520
He has a minimum amount of testosterone
and he weighs 18 pounds because he was,

2868
02:41:58,521 --> 02:42:00,900
he was a manly man,
like an Elvis Presley type dude.

2869
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:04,980
A reason why all of us lost fucking mind
and pills cause he, he ran out of com.

2870
02:42:05,150 --> 02:42:08,700
Okay, thanks. They sucked
all the come out of his body.

2871
02:42:08,701 --> 02:42:12,220
So he just started taking pills. Is
that dangerous? I guess it is there.

2872
02:42:12,221 --> 02:42:16,050
You can't fuck everybody. You can. You
mean, look, there's a bottom. You know,

2873
02:42:16,051 --> 02:42:18,690
there's like, there's a
comfortable medium. You know,

2874
02:42:18,810 --> 02:42:21,190
you could be like Bill Clinton,
you know,

2875
02:42:22,280 --> 02:42:23,720
you could be like a serious Dick's linger,

2876
02:42:23,900 --> 02:42:27,480
but you can't be like Elvis Presley
Dang made it to ripe old age.

2877
02:42:27,810 --> 02:42:30,450
They were allegedly, who knows what
it was like hanging around with them.

2878
02:42:30,810 --> 02:42:32,190
I mean the guy did a lot of crazy shit.

2879
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:34,770
Maybe that was why it was launching
flaming bodies over the roof.

2880
02:42:34,770 --> 02:42:37,200
The fucking here's out of cons
and crazy and how to calm.

2881
02:42:37,201 --> 02:42:40,460
The guy was just calming all day long.
Constantly. I think when you're there,

2882
02:42:40,461 --> 02:42:43,860
I mean then by the way,
Gingiss existed in an era without Twitter.

2883
02:42:45,150 --> 02:42:48,120
Good luck pulling all that shit off
with Facebook. They'd fucking revolt.

2884
02:42:48,130 --> 02:42:51,270
Do you know what he's doing? Jesus
Christ, but the Bieber thing,

2885
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:56,300
it's like this kid is experiencing not
just a level of fame that most human

2886
02:42:57,541 --> 02:42:59,130
beings will never experience.

2887
02:42:59,131 --> 02:43:04,131
Almost all human beings will
never experience 99.9% of
famous people will never

2888
02:43:05,101 --> 02:43:09,540
experience the level of fame that
Justin Bieber is on. Not only that,

2889
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:12,100
he's doing it in the craziest time

2890
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:13,810
ever to be famous.

2891
02:43:14,350 --> 02:43:19,350
An era where there is just constant 24
hour images coming in of everything you

2892
02:43:21,191 --> 02:43:24,370
do, every time he drives fast,
every time you smoked pot,

2893
02:43:24,490 --> 02:43:26,860
every time he gets pulled over,
every time he gets arrested,

2894
02:43:26,861 --> 02:43:29,890
every time something crazy happens
and he's clearly out of control.

2895
02:43:30,460 --> 02:43:35,460
He's 19 he's got a half I'll
fucking billion dollars in
his pocket and he's just

2896
02:43:35,981 --> 02:43:40,030
running around like a maniac with the
Willy Wonka golden ticket. What would,

2897
02:43:40,031 --> 02:43:42,760
what would anybody expect this
kid to do differently? Well,

2898
02:43:42,761 --> 02:43:47,380
every action needs an equally powerful
reaction and I think if you were in that

2899
02:43:47,381 --> 02:43:51,100
very challenge, I'm not going to deny
it's an immensely challenging situation.

2900
02:43:51,101 --> 02:43:53,200
You got to go fucking overboard.

2901
02:43:53,350 --> 02:43:58,210
The other way to make sure that you keep
some level of sanity or ride that bitch

2902
02:43:58,211 --> 02:44:01,690
right into the beach. Justin Bieber
style smoked pot on airplanes.

2903
02:44:01,691 --> 02:44:04,630
It's all the pilots have to do
fucking oxygen or to stay on the edge.

2904
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:05,650
You hear about that?
No,

2905
02:44:05,860 --> 02:44:09,610
he was on a plane and apparently he was
smoking so much pot on the plane that

2906
02:44:09,611 --> 02:44:13,000
the pilots had to put oxygen masks on.
Look at the,

2907
02:44:13,150 --> 02:44:16,480
the FAA is looking into allegations
regarding Bieber's flight to New Jersey.

2908
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:20,560
The FAA is investigating it cause he
was on a private jet and he just started

2909
02:44:20,561 --> 02:44:23,800
lighting up. He can do whatever
he wants. He probably flew naked.

2910
02:44:23,830 --> 02:44:26,920
The entire trip was probably negative
with a hard on. You could probably do it.

2911
02:44:26,921 --> 02:44:31,630
Viagara and cocaine together.
Smoking weed. He's a fucking maniac.

2912
02:44:31,780 --> 02:44:33,010
And how could he not be?

2913
02:44:33,250 --> 02:44:37,480
He has got more money than he could
ever spend in a thousand lifetimes.

2914
02:44:37,810 --> 02:44:40,900
And he's 19 and by the way,
everywhere it goes,

2915
02:44:41,050 --> 02:44:43,300
girls literally lose their shit,

2916
02:44:43,660 --> 02:44:48,660
scream and run at him and try to tear
his clothes off and his songs suck.

2917
02:44:51,550 --> 02:44:53,110
So it doesn't even make any sense.

2918
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:57,670
It's not like he's just unbelievable
creative force that made these songs that

2919
02:44:57,671 --> 02:45:01,390
are just, you've got to recognize
the genius of this man. I mean,

2920
02:45:01,391 --> 02:45:05,690
he's the modern Mozart. He's
fucking, he's Michelangelo.

2921
02:45:05,770 --> 02:45:10,600
If he was a singer, he said the
art that he produces it at. No,

2922
02:45:10,601 --> 02:45:13,930
it's terrible. It's terrible, stupid
shit. And he sounds like a girl.

2923
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:15,310
He sings like a girl.

2924
02:45:15,311 --> 02:45:20,311
He's touching their inner soul
with his own music and they run,

2925
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:24,670
they run like fucking World
War z just charging at them.

2926
02:45:26,270 --> 02:45:29,950
You know,
even Alexander the great had it would,

2927
02:45:30,070 --> 02:45:33,760
he was not in perfect in any way,
but he had fucking Aristotle,

2928
02:45:33,761 --> 02:45:38,410
which was one of the greatest minds in
the universe as his mentor. You know,

2929
02:45:38,411 --> 02:45:41,500
to kind of keep that guy in check because
he conquered the fucking known world

2930
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:46,210
at 25 you know,
he had that Justin Bieber s kind of power,

2931
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:49,780
even more crazy, more crazy murderer.
Yeah. Cause he could do whatever,

2932
02:45:49,781 --> 02:45:53,680
but he's not going down as Ganga
is one of these terrible PBL.

2933
02:45:53,681 --> 02:45:56,590
I'm sure he wasn't fucking
perfect, but he had, you know,

2934
02:45:56,591 --> 02:46:01,591
he did some sensible acts because maybe
you had like one of the greatest mentors

2935
02:46:03,101 --> 02:46:05,050
of all time and sometimes that fails.

2936
02:46:05,051 --> 02:46:07,840
Obviously Seneca wasn't
very successful with Nero.

2937
02:46:07,960 --> 02:46:11,870
That thing fucking went straight into
the fucking dirt and didn't really work.

2938
02:46:11,871 --> 02:46:16,040
But I just feel like if someone was some
real sense and some good psychedelics

2939
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:20,270
could get to him, he could be a fucking
powerful force for good. Listen,

2940
02:46:20,271 --> 02:46:24,650
Willie d from the Geto boys said it
best. You got to let a hoby. Oh, okay.

2941
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:29,540
He can't fix everybody, man. Don't
worry about Justin Bieber. Let's watch,

2942
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:34,010
let's watch him ride that fucking chrome
Ferrari right over the cliff of life.

2943
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:38,900
You know the thing about Alexander
the great too, he's gay, you know,

2944
02:46:38,901 --> 02:46:42,320
so maybe a different motivation.
It's that gayish allegedly,

2945
02:46:42,830 --> 02:46:46,340
probably a bunch of chicks line
about him. Fucking him. I mean,

2946
02:46:46,341 --> 02:46:47,780
he had a boyfriend killed his boyfriend,

2947
02:46:48,590 --> 02:46:51,700
boyfriends and girlfriends and he just
fuck everybody. Fuck they're fucked.

2948
02:46:51,701 --> 02:46:52,820
Everybody didn't matter.

2949
02:46:53,120 --> 02:46:55,940
Well maybe he just didn't have
as much common as gang as con.

2950
02:46:56,540 --> 02:46:57,680
Maybe getting his car lasts.

2951
02:46:57,800 --> 02:47:00,710
I mean obviously didn't because
Gingiss con is responsible.

2952
02:47:00,711 --> 02:47:03,890
Like what does it like fucking
1% of all of Asia is more,

2953
02:47:03,900 --> 02:47:08,050
it's like five what percentage?
Some ridiculous. Yeah.
Percentage of the humanity.

2954
02:47:08,620 --> 02:47:13,480
Yeah. Let's, let's what
percentage? Kingus Khan. Yes. Kay.

2955
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:19,300
I bet it's like 5%. Okay.
Prolific DNA and prize. Okay.

2956
02:47:19,301 --> 02:47:22,630
Ready for this? This is,
this is a real, okay.

2957
02:47:24,010 --> 02:47:25,540
Wow.
Holy Shit.

2958
02:47:25,990 --> 02:47:30,280
It's one half of 1% of the world today.

2959
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:34,540
Roughly 16 million
descendants living today.

2960
02:47:35,500 --> 02:47:38,920
Cause that's not as much as I thought
it was. Maybe it'd be more, um,

2961
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:43,390
more people in China. Yeah. Higher
percentage in those regions. For sure.

2962
02:47:45,700 --> 02:47:46,091
Thank you.

2963
02:47:46,091 --> 02:47:49,580
Think about how much he altered the
course of history with all the people he

2964
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:54,250
killed. Yeah, no shit man. I mean all
the blood lines he ended, oh, Jesus.

2965
02:47:54,251 --> 02:47:57,850
8% Oh my God.
No,

2966
02:47:57,851 --> 02:48:01,870
it's way more than that.
It's one half of 1% is just the world.

2967
02:48:02,140 --> 02:48:02,920
But uh,

2968
02:48:02,920 --> 02:48:07,920
it's 8% of people living
in one part of Asia.

2969
02:48:07,931 --> 02:48:09,280
Where is it?
What part of his

2970
02:48:15,250 --> 02:48:16,083
Inner Mongolia,

2971
02:48:16,630 --> 02:48:20,590
hold on. I'm trying to find, really want
to go to Mongolia? Yeah. Well fuck. Yeah,

2972
02:48:20,591 --> 02:48:24,910
man. It'd be fascinating. I think
that, uh, just seeing the wall,

2973
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,990
the Great Wall would be fucking amazing
seeing this area where they were,

2974
02:48:29,290 --> 02:48:32,140
they were so scared of
these fucking terrorists,

2975
02:48:32,590 --> 02:48:35,920
these savages that they
built a giant wall,

2976
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:40,220
one of the greatest walls and
game of Thrones. Literally. Yeah.

2977
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:45,240
8% of all the males living in the regions
of the former Mongolian empire carried

2978
02:48:46,031 --> 02:48:48,310
a nearly identical y chromosomes,

2979
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:51,300
suggesting that they were all
direct descendants of gangs. Con.

2980
02:48:53,010 --> 02:48:53,700
Wow.

2981
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:58,700
8% that's a gangster to
the to the nth degree,

2982
02:48:59,280 --> 02:49:01,230
but it doesn't get any more
gangster than him anyway.

2983
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:04,230
He's fucking sets the east sets the bar,

2984
02:49:04,500 --> 02:49:07,830
sets the mark right at the end
of gangster. There's gangs cop,

2985
02:49:07,890 --> 02:49:10,530
and I've said this before, but if you,
if you haven't ever listened to it,

2986
02:49:10,531 --> 02:49:13,560
you've got to listen to Dan
Carlin's hardcore history,

2987
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:17,640
the wrath of the con in five parts
and it's riveting the whole time.

2988
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:21,060
He's a bad mother fucker. Dan Carlin is
such a bad motherfucker. Hardcore history.

2989
02:49:21,061 --> 02:49:23,310
If you don't know fucking fantastic,

2990
02:49:23,311 --> 02:49:27,270
fantastic podcast and that's the,
that's the ground.

2991
02:49:27,450 --> 02:49:32,450
The grand crowning achievement is that
Gaviscon series a five part fuck doors.

2992
02:49:34,681 --> 02:49:36,420
Angels too.
It's fantastic.

2993
02:49:36,660 --> 02:49:41,660
All about Martin Luther and Constantine
and the Bible and all the craziness that

2994
02:49:42,601 --> 02:49:43,890
went on when they were,

2995
02:49:44,050 --> 02:49:48,570
when they converted the
Bible to a phonetic language
and the way he sets it up.

2996
02:49:48,570 --> 02:49:52,350
It's just fucking brilliant man.
You have a podcast too,

2997
02:49:53,010 --> 02:49:57,300
warrior poet, right? Yup. And is
it on iTunes? If people can get,

2998
02:49:57,301 --> 02:50:01,320
do you do a video aspect of it? Sometimes.
Sometimes the bents. Yeah, I have.

2999
02:50:01,321 --> 02:50:03,540
Some of them, a lot of them are on
video. And what do you put that?

3000
02:50:04,170 --> 02:50:08,450
I put that it's usually stays on Ustream.
Just kind of lives up there on the,

3001
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:09,960
what is the,
the Ustream channel.

3002
02:50:10,140 --> 02:50:14,520
I think it's all homogenous warrior
poet us for Facebook, Twitter, you know,

3003
02:50:14,521 --> 02:50:17,880
everything. That's kind of my handle. So
I tried to keep it consistent. Beautiful.

3004
02:50:17,881 --> 02:50:22,620
So if people can't get enough of Aubrey's
delicious tones, go and listen to it.

3005
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:25,740
Go download it, check it out.
I keep them kind of short too.

3006
02:50:25,741 --> 02:50:28,800
So I know we got a lot of good
material to listen to. I'm in the 30,

3007
02:50:28,801 --> 02:50:32,970
45 minute range for most of them. So we
get right to it. Well, I don't even flirt.

3008
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:37,080
I just pulled the pants down
and we go deep. That's how
to do it, man. I think, um,

3009
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:42,160
I really think that this
model of hyperconscious,

3010
02:50:42,780 --> 02:50:47,670
uh, ethical business like that
you're doing with on it and that,

3011
02:50:47,700 --> 02:50:51,420
you know, we like to support as much as
possible when we see outside of on it.

3012
02:50:51,660 --> 02:50:56,580
I really think it can inspire a lot more
likeminded souls. A lot more people.

3013
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:59,190
And uh, I think it's, it's
really cool that you do this,

3014
02:50:59,191 --> 02:51:00,480
that you put all this stuff out there,

3015
02:51:00,481 --> 02:51:03,130
that you put out the blog and
then you put out, he marked,

3016
02:51:03,140 --> 02:51:06,690
you write some really cool blogs and that
you put out, you really rarely, I mean,

3017
02:51:06,691 --> 02:51:09,630
you, you, you, you put not
just put the time in it,

3018
02:51:09,631 --> 02:51:12,970
you put the thought into it and it's all
there. It's all real. You know, you're,

3019
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:16,140
you're really tapping into whatever the
fuck is going on inside your mind and

3020
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:20,140
what you're trying to express. And on top
of running an awesome company, you know,

3021
02:51:20,170 --> 02:51:22,470
that's,
that's a very admirable thing.

3022
02:51:22,770 --> 02:51:27,770
And it's also very inspirational and
that I think that that tone and that

3023
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:32,400
mindset that that spreads, man,
that shit is contagious. Well,

3024
02:51:32,401 --> 02:51:37,290
it's coming from a real place. You know,
if I'm, that's what I feel like, I dunno,

3025
02:51:37,291 --> 02:51:42,240
that's what I feel like I've been my
best actualization as all the tools and

3026
02:51:42,270 --> 02:51:45,210
everything that I've been
given is to follow that path.

3027
02:51:45,211 --> 02:51:48,660
And I like figuring stuff out.
I know that I know pretty much nothing.

3028
02:51:48,661 --> 02:51:52,620
And when I start to find little bits and
nuggets and morsels of truth along the

3029
02:51:52,621 --> 02:51:56,190
way, it's exciting. And then being
able to share those and then, you know,

3030
02:51:56,191 --> 02:51:59,430
not being attached to them either if
something else comes up. Cool. You know,

3031
02:51:59,431 --> 02:52:03,750
just really trying to put the best
shit out there and improve the mood of

3032
02:52:03,780 --> 02:52:06,070
humanity as a whole and
show that you can still do

3033
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:08,170
this and make money.
You can still do this and be successful.

3034
02:52:08,171 --> 02:52:11,350
Like capitalism doesn't always have to
be evil, you know, it can be ethical,

3035
02:52:11,351 --> 02:52:14,680
it can be conscious, socially
conscious. It can be like,

3036
02:52:15,110 --> 02:52:16,570
it's like friendly capitalism.

3037
02:52:16,790 --> 02:52:19,100
Yeah. People have a bad
taste in their mouth about,

3038
02:52:19,101 --> 02:52:22,970
you say the Word Corporation and it's
just cause the brains of that thing or rot

3039
02:52:23,060 --> 02:52:24,780
or rotted out. But if you get, you know,

3040
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:28,850
good brains and a good conscious and
the right kind of motivation behind it,

3041
02:52:28,970 --> 02:52:30,310
I think you could change people's minds.

3042
02:52:30,330 --> 02:52:34,130
There's a lot of other ethical companies
out there besides on it too. There are,

3043
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:38,900
there are. Um, I just, uh, I
don't get them on the podcast
that month. Yeah, for sure.

3044
02:52:38,930 --> 02:52:42,830
All right. Uh, I appreciate all you
guys who listen and stuff. I mean,

3045
02:52:42,831 --> 02:52:45,050
some bad motherfuckers really collected,

3046
02:52:45,051 --> 02:52:47,840
some of the coolest people
in the universe are coming,

3047
02:52:47,841 --> 02:52:51,170
attaching to this momentum and
creating this wave. You know,

3048
02:52:51,171 --> 02:52:53,420
you're a part of all these things
that we show on the pockets,

3049
02:52:53,421 --> 02:52:56,180
these things about weed law,
laws being legalized. I mean,

3050
02:52:56,181 --> 02:52:57,800
your a nugget of consciousness.

3051
02:52:57,801 --> 02:53:01,220
So many of you that are pushing this
forward and that's what we need, you know,

3052
02:53:01,221 --> 02:53:02,840
will move the needle,
you know,

3053
02:53:02,841 --> 02:53:05,060
as long as soon as the people
move the needles themselves.

3054
02:53:05,061 --> 02:53:09,350
So telling your friends and spreading
the word and talking openly, being cool.

3055
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:12,470
That's why podcasts like this exist. I
mean, the reason why, I mean there's a,

3056
02:53:12,471 --> 02:53:15,320
there's obviously it's, it's
hitting, it's, there's a resonance.

3057
02:53:15,770 --> 02:53:17,330
It's resonating with people,
you know,

3058
02:53:17,331 --> 02:53:20,990
and that's the only reason why I exist
if I did this podcast and then every week

3059
02:53:20,991 --> 02:53:25,130
it was like, it was fucking terrible. Stop
doing it. But I eventually, I'd be like,

3060
02:53:25,131 --> 02:53:29,930
man, I'm gonna stop doing that podcast.
But it beats the positive resonance is,

3061
02:53:29,931 --> 02:53:32,710
is as much responsible for,
uh,

3062
02:53:32,780 --> 02:53:36,290
these thoughts as anything because
it's reinforcing it. I mean, podcast,

3063
02:53:36,291 --> 02:53:37,550
much like stand up comedy,

3064
02:53:37,820 --> 02:53:41,510
it's an art form that is
meaningless without an audience,

3065
02:53:41,750 --> 02:53:43,910
without an audience who
would just be my edification.

3066
02:53:43,911 --> 02:53:45,320
It would just be these conversations,

3067
02:53:45,830 --> 02:53:49,790
which I really appreciate that I could
sit down with so many cool people like

3068
02:53:49,791 --> 02:53:53,280
you or like Cameron Hanes or like, you
know, fill in the blank. You don't do it.

3069
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:56,000
Graham Hancock,
Dr or mid go swami.

3070
02:53:56,001 --> 02:53:59,580
All these really cool people that I've
been able to sit down and talk to the,

3071
02:53:59,650 --> 02:54:02,570
that would just be for myself,
you know?

3072
02:54:02,630 --> 02:54:06,320
I would've never been able to pull it off
though. I wouldn't be able to say, hey,

3073
02:54:06,350 --> 02:54:08,720
could you sit down and talk with
me for three hours? They'd be like,

3074
02:54:08,721 --> 02:54:13,200
what the fuck am I? I got an earlier dude.
I don't even know you man. But because,

3075
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:16,310
because I'm going to say,
oh blah blah. But everybody
else can listen. They go, oh,

3076
02:54:16,311 --> 02:54:18,770
everybody can listen. Yeah.
Yeah. Everybody, the whole world.

3077
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:20,590
Billions of people there.
All right. All right.

3078
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:23,480
Let's talk and then they'll sit down and
we'll talk to you. It's a cool thing.

3079
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:25,520
So for me, uh, you know,

3080
02:54:25,521 --> 02:54:28,370
people say thank you for the
podcast has been so beneficial.

3081
02:54:28,410 --> 02:54:30,590
It's changed my life.
It's changed my life too.

3082
02:54:30,830 --> 02:54:34,640
It's been hugely beneficial for me
because it's given me this vehicle for

3083
02:54:34,641 --> 02:54:35,900
exploring these ideas.

3084
02:54:36,590 --> 02:54:41,590
It's giving me this ability to tap
into a million different paths,

3085
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,990
different information that's
coming at me all the time.

3086
02:54:45,110 --> 02:54:49,130
Different points of view from people that
I deeply respect and I don't think the

3087
02:54:49,131 --> 02:54:52,440
way they think and I get to see the way
they think and I wrote, I'm a crier.

3088
02:54:52,580 --> 02:54:55,280
You know, even people that don't
agree with people I do agree with.

3089
02:54:55,281 --> 02:54:56,600
Like a lot of times people go,
oh,

3090
02:54:56,601 --> 02:54:58,460
you don't fucking call
people on their bullshit.

3091
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:01,430
Sometimes I don't call people on
their bullshit. Sometimes I do,

3092
02:55:01,550 --> 02:55:04,070
but one of the reasons why I don't,
sometimes I want to hear what they're

3093
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:04,790
thinking.

3094
02:55:04,790 --> 02:55:08,770
I instead of constantly judging everything
that comes out of people's mouth,

3095
02:55:08,830 --> 02:55:10,460
my mouth,
which I do a lot.

3096
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:14,090
What I like to do sometimes
is I like to let it play out.

3097
02:55:14,120 --> 02:55:18,290
I like to hear the full version of it
and then consider it or not consider it.

3098
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:19,333
You know,
there's,

3099
02:55:19,550 --> 02:55:23,330
there's a million different ways to
view this life and there's millions of

3100
02:55:23,331 --> 02:55:27,350
different eyes to see these things
through. And I'm different from you.

3101
02:55:27,380 --> 02:55:31,750
You're different from me. And together
we sort of collectively get, uh, the, we,

3102
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:36,710
we get a middle, we get sort of
collectively, we get an id of like,

3103
02:55:36,711 --> 02:55:40,850
what, how's that was a lot of fighters.
It might be, Huh, we'll help each other.

3104
02:55:40,880 --> 02:55:45,530
The only way we're going to ever really
get a grip on what the fuck reality

3105
02:55:45,531 --> 02:55:46,364
itself is,

3106
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:51,260
is if we all share our on edited,

3107
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:56,150
uncensored opinions on
things and let the truth out.

3108
02:55:56,300 --> 02:55:59,510
Sunlight and fresh air. That's not
easy to do, man. It's not easy to do.

3109
02:55:59,511 --> 02:56:02,900
It's not easy to find. And in this
world is a very few opportunities.

3110
02:56:03,230 --> 02:56:05,570
This podcast has become
an opportunity to do that.

3111
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:10,570
By sheer luck or not. I mean, maybe it's
not. Maybe it's the fucking university,

3112
02:56:10,690 --> 02:56:13,970
as you said, we're just good. We're just
good conduits for something greater.

3113
02:56:14,140 --> 02:56:19,140
And we just happened to be a well shaped
hoes that whatever infor information

3114
02:56:19,461 --> 02:56:22,940
inspiration can kind of float through
and, and that's, and that's it.

3115
02:56:23,030 --> 02:56:26,510
We'll keep it together. You dirty fucks.
Love you all. We love you all. Um,

3116
02:56:26,511 --> 02:56:28,460
next week we got Monday and mortal,

3117
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:31,730
a mortal technique is going to
come on the podcast, uh, with a,

3118
02:56:31,731 --> 02:56:36,470

A Wednesday war machine is going

And, uh, he's awesome of than
people give him credit for it.

3122
02:56:48,250 --> 02:56:51,350
I think that dude's going to open up a
lot of people's minds is going to freak

3123
02:56:51,351 --> 02:56:55,310
