1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,700
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,120
two,
and boom.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,100
That's a nice hat I've told you already,
but live,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,190
I got to tell you,
that was a nice.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,570
It's,
it's very,

6
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,310
uh,
kind of Indiana Jones,

7
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:17,910
but it's not quite that cowboy.
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,140
You're like in the middle of that,
dancing on the edge.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,070
What can I have a really fat head.
And so there's this website called like 

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,530
big heads.com.
There's a website,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,560
it's a total website for,
to get my friend Paul Burke Chrysler a 

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:33,560
hat.
Then put his hat on.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,301
I couldn't believe how big his head was.
Like there was like an inch gap over in 

14
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:38,820
my head.
I thought I had a big head.

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,840
Yeah.
So,

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,130
uh,
if you know your head,

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,720
your head size,
do you know your head size?

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,380
No,
I do not.

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,770
So,
uh,

20
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,380
so it turns out if you know your head 
size,

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,990
that that number comes from somewhere.
Can I tell you what it is?

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,050
Sure.
So if you measure the circumference of 

23
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,050
your head,
just get a tape measure,

24
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,520
like you mentioned your waistline,
but do it around your head and take that

25
00:00:56,521 --> 00:01:00,180
number divided by Pi.
Then that's your hat size.

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,340
Whoa.
Just seems complicated.

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,930
Abide by to your waist.
Thirty two is what you're wasting.

28
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,890
It just is what it is,
right?

29
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,630
Just why it can't just be the 
circumference,

30
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:14,370
right?
So what it turns out to be.

31
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,250
So what that means is if you're dividing
by Pi,

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,280
you're getting the diameter of the 
circle that has the same dimension as,

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,210
as the circumference of your head.
So if you have an oblong head,

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,850
then what it's doing is finding out what
the circle is.

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,000
The diameter of the circle that has that
same circumference is your head.

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
That's what that's doing for whatever,
for whatever.

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,310
Whether that helps the hat,
the hat maker.

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,520
So immediately I started thinking about 
Dan Akroyd and siren and live as a cone 

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,240
head within India.
Tall hat for that to get it.

40
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,670
So do you still doing stand up?
That's great.

41
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,870
Constantly loving it.
Yeah.

42
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,410
And they caught you a few months ago.
You were emceeing some MMA,

43
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,100
was it?
What was.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,230
Well,
I'm always doing that.

45
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,830
Kept some of it.
Then stayed in shape because I'm,

46
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,390
I'm a.
I'm a fat Slob,

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,010
right?
Back in the day,

48
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:13,011
and then I,
and I was like some street credit back 

49
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:19,431
then you exercise at all now.
It's not that I don't have the energy 

50
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:20,410
to.
It's,

51
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,510
it's trying to find the test.
You back in the day looking at you it.

52
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,440
How much do you weigh back then?
Oh,

53
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,380
oh,
go on once.

54
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,440
No,
no,

55
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,300
no.
I'm 6,190

56
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,880
pounds in that.
Oh exactly.

57
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,190
I have big thighs and stuff.
Um,

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,810
other wrestlers would have skinnier 
thighs and things.

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,330
So I was also taller than anyone I 
wrestled.

60
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:44,331
So since we're the same height,
it meant they had bigger muscles 

61
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:44,730
actually.
So because we're the same weight.

62
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,620
Right.
But I'm sorry,

63
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,480
did I say that right?
I'm taller but with the same weight.

64
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,070
So that means they have bigger muscles,
right?

65
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,360
Because none of us have fat.
Right?

66
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,510
So I had to do things that my lankiness 
would enable me to do and to accomplish 

67
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:02,211
that they couldn't.
So I have long reach this sort of scoop 

68
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:02,211
an ankle,
that kind of thing.

69
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:05,700
It's great advantages to having long 
limbs in martial arts space,

70
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,880
particularly in wrestling grappling 
because the leverage.

71
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,890
Yeah.
Also if you're quick and with Linda and 

72
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,331
I was both,
but if they got me in their grip it was 

73
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:16,000
hard for me to get out.
So what kind of exercise do you do these

74
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,220
days?

75
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,250
I know I'm trying.
I'm trying.

76
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,520
I'm trying.
When I'm in I'm good,

77
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,140
but I've just got so much going on.
You have to like make the time.

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,150
That's a problem,
right?

79
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,320
When you become a little bit for your 
own food,

80
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,970
there's a lot of food documentaries,
you know,

81
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,730
trying to get you to eat differently.
So I thought I'd watched the wall.

82
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,790
I've binged on them one weekend while I 
was doing other stuff and I got hungry.

83
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,290
No one of one.
One of the guys,

84
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,240
he was trying to lose 100 pounds or 
something,

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,480
so every 15 pounds he lost.
He put a bowling ball up on the counter 

86
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,890
and said,
that is what I'm not carrying around 

87
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:58,890
with me because of bowling balls.
About 15 pounds.

88
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,260
I said,
wow.

89
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:04,261
He's measuring awaiting bowling balls.
That's something because we say I'm 

90
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:04,870
three pounds less than two pounds.

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,700
That doesn't hit you emotionally the way
a bowling ball does after you've lost 15

92
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,310
pounds because no one wants to be 
carrying that around.

93
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,470
So psychological,
I thought that was quite potent.

94
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,450
That is potent.
I think we do need to.

95
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,800
I usually use like plates.
I think of weight plates or Dumbbell.

96
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,470
Okay.
Yeah,

97
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,140
that works too.
Yeah.

98
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,260
Yeah.
I uh,

99
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:28,261
I started doing intermittent fasting 
pretty recently where I only allow 

100
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:29,430
myself to eat 10 hours in a day.
Oh Wow.

101
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,430
10 out of the 24 hours.
Yes.

102
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,220
So I had a terry crews on my radio show 
on start talking that boys,

103
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,320
my boys ripped.
He looks great.

104
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,500
He's still and he's like 47 or 
something.

105
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:46,501
I mean he's so he doesn't eat until 12 
noon and that he doesn't eat until after

106
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,730
10:00.
That's right.

107
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,850
Yeah.
Ten minutes that he doesn't need after 

108
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:53,850
10.
It's a 10 hour thing.

109
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,940
And so he has to.
He's watching everyone else have brunch 

110
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:56,940
and breakfast and so he's got to 
overcome that.

111
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,250
But uh,
so it's a little bit of fasting each 

112
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,521
day.
Intermittent fast just to keep the 

113
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:05,521
discipline.
I think at the end of the day,

114
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:10,021
it's really just discipline that it also
forces your body to burn fat instead of 

115
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,010
carbohydrates and when it forces your 
body to burn fat,

116
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,190
that state of Ketosis is actually easy 
to maintain because you don't.

117
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,210
You don't get hungry.
Yeah.

118
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,090
Then there's no rollercoaster.
Yeah,

119
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,710
the crash that.
But the carbohydrate crash that you get,

120
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,170
is that outside of the realm of 
possibility for,

121
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:24,250
you know,
I can totally.

122
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm a ketosis guy.
Anything involving science,

123
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,950
maybe it's in there.
I.

124
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,230
I once got raked over the coals.
Not by everyone,

125
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:37,240
but I tweeted once.
I said,

126
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,770
if there was a diet book written by a 
physicist who will contain one sentence,

127
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,470
consume calories at a lesser rate than 
at a greater rate,

128
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,200
consumed calories at a lesser rate than 
you burn them.

129
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,230
That is sort of true.
That's the one sentence.

130
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,510
Do know.
It's more complicated than that and 

131
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,800
everyone just try to get all this is 
that and that and one of the great 

132
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,761
things of physics when you,
when you do physics is all the details 

133
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:10,481
are just cut off the window dressing and
you get down to the window itself and 

134
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:14,930
that's what the analysis works on.
I have rarely seen you attacked,

135
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,140
but I did see you attack when you were 
celebrating a Sir Isaac Newton's 

136
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,140
birthday.

137
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,950
Oh No.
I was like,

138
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,870
people were so mad.
People lost their mind lost in mind when

139
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,280
you were,
by the way,

140
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,610
incorrect in the date of Jesus's 
birthday.

141
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,700
That is not the date of Jesus.
Jesus did not.

142
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,610
Was Not born on the 25th.
Right?

143
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,430
Plus I didn't even mention that.
Well,

144
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,290
so what I said was,
by the way,

145
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:43,700
that to this day is my highest retweeted
tweet.

146
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,500
I tweeted it.
So you remember,

147
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:48,200
it was actually a couple of years ago.
Yeah,

148
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,620
so it was on December 25th comes.
Here it is.

149
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,360
You've got to transform the world.
Happy Birthday on this day.

150
00:06:56,361 --> 00:07:01,361
Long ago a child was born who by age 30 
were transformed the world.

151
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,010
Happy Birthday,
Isaac Newton,

152
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,260
born December 25th,
16,

153
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,980
40 to 79,000
retweets.

154
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,940
Thousand life people just lost them.
So mad they're angry.

155
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:14,510
And I thought,
well,

156
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:17,330
it's interesting because I'm just 
speaking the truth here.

157
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,900
Yes,
he transformed civilization by boy.

158
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,970
Actually he did it by the time he was 
26.

159
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,070
Um,
so yes,

160
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:30,071
it's provocative because you're 
expecting the Jesus is going to end 

161
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:32,621
that.
But I thought I'd share it some extra 

162
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:34,040
actual truth with people and so some 
people celebrate it deeply.

163
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,350
Religious people.
One had a headline,

164
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:40,280
St Neil degrasse Tyson is trolling 
Christians on Christmas Day.

165
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,580
And I said,
I said Newton at least has the benefit 

166
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,190
of actually having been born that day.
And then later on it,

167
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,440
it's actually more subtle than that with
Newton because he was on the Julian 

168
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,461
calendar which was,
which is 10 days shifted from the 

169
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:57,950
Gregorian calendar.
So if you ask what would his birthday be

170
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,910
today,
it would be January fourth,

171
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,870
December 25th.
So yeah.

172
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:05,330
But when he was born,
his mother was celebrating Christmas.

173
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:07,100
So that's really what matters for that 
tweet.

174
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,660
This is a bizarre thing anyway because 
if you're a real Christian,

175
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:16,661
you would understand that the birthday 
was shifted in order to comply with 

176
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:17,100
pagan religion.

177
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,950
That's exactly it.
It landed.

178
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,960
I don't know how many people know that 
actually.

179
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,760
I mean you're a well read guy,
but.

180
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,790
So if you give me a minute to just 
explain that.

181
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,000
So December 21st we know his first day 
of winter,

182
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,790
shortest day of the year,
and what makes it short?

183
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,190
Shortest daylight of the year.
And what makes it short?

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,280
The arc of the sun across the sky is 
very low.

185
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,030
The Sun doesn't get very high and it 
doesn't stay up for very long and it's 

186
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,250
been coming a lower and lower arch every
day on route to December 20.

187
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:51,251
First,
the ancient peoples were worried about 

188
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:53,891
this because everyone worship the sun 
because it made your crops come and he 

189
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:53,990
gave you warmth and you say,
wow,

190
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,700
if this keeps going lower and lower in 
the sky,

191
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,940
we're going to lose the sun entirely.
December 21st the sun slows down and it 

192
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,260
stops this load.

193
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,290
This drop in,
it's moving across the sky from day to 

194
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,210
day,
so that stopping of the sun is solstice.

195
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,170
That Latin stationary son like 
armistice,

196
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,470
stationary arms,
right from the end of the first world 

197
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,470
war,
a weather November 11th,

198
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,830
that was armistice solstice,
so,

199
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,830
so the movement of the sun lower in the 
sky stops,

200
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,290
but that doesn't mean it's going to come
back.

201
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,610
It takes a few days for it to slow down,
stop and then reverse.

202
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:33,480
He said,
oh,

203
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,940
it is coming back.
Let's celebrate that,

204
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,270
and that's a few days after December 20.
First was about December 25th of Pagan 

205
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,770
holiday celebrating the return to the 
sun.

206
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,750
Christianity is trying to take foothold 
where there were were pagans once roamed

207
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,550
and you.
You put celebrations that match.

208
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:56,551
There's just so that the the shift is 
not as hard for you and the unknown 

209
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:01,161
birthday of Jesus within a signed this 
Pagan Day of celebration to make that 

210
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:03,630
transition easier for the Pagans to 
become Christians.

211
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,870
And sure enough,
it remained Christmas day and ever since

212
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,670
the birth of Jesus,
the speculated birthday of Jesus is like

213
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,670
the spring,
the spring.

214
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:12,330
I,
there's some,

215
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,090
there's some passages,
uh,

216
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:18,990
of course in the new testament that 
reference with the sheep were doing plus

217
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:21,150
there's a sense of being taken by the 
Romans,

218
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,840
which is what,
and Mary goes to the manger,

219
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,850
the animals are not in the manger and 
not at the.

220
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,850
So the,
there's secondary evidence for that.

221
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,730
It's probably happened in the spring now

222
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,330
with the advent of commercial space 
travel.

223
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,000
No.
Seems,

224
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,370
seems,
seems inevitable,

225
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,690
right?
Love you.

226
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Love your Segues d,
do you think that it's possible that 

227
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,891
maybe you could even offer up a flat 
earth believer tour where you take them,

228
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,610
like at the very least,
take them up to Alaska where it's light.

229
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,670
So 23 hours of calling into you.
Is this at tweeting me constantly 

230
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,250
telling me constantly,
yeah,

231
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,000
call me a sellout.
I'm a sellout around earth sellout.

232
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,150
Like as if there's some round earth 
money while you're on the payroll 

233
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,210
checks.
I'm getting some ground earth,

234
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,680
Earth Pale.
Or for your show,

235
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,160
I'm sure you've seen the basketball 
player who graduated from Duke,

236
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,490
from Duke.
That was hitting the news the last 

237
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:22,490
couple of days.
I saw the leaves that dinosaurs are fake

238
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,330
and that the world is flat.
Okay,

239
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,270
so here's the thing,
Joe,

240
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,640
I've thought about this.
I bet you have.

241
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,440
As an educator,
I've thought about this.

242
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,260
Okay?
So

243
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,770
here's,
here's what matters.

244
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,660
All right?
We live in a free country.

245
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,140
People should be able to think what ever
they want,

246
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,060
whenever they want,
provided it doesn't subtract away from 

247
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,250
someone else's rights.
Okay?

248
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,850
So thinking the earth is flat doesn't 
harm anyone unless you to run for office

249
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,330
or you want some position of power over 
other people.

250
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,930
That's when it's dangerous.
I thinking of elevator banks where they 

251
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:03,990
have numbers,
you know,

252
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I,
I have a photo essay of what elevators 

253
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,590
look like inside.
I know it's just,

254
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,610
I mean,
the gears.

255
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:11,890
No,
no,

256
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,110
no,
no,

257
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:12,340
no,
no,

258
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,580
no,
no,

259
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,840
no,
not even that Geeky.

260
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,030
Just what are the numbers on the panel?
Uh,

261
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,280
without the 13 you mean?
Yeah,

262
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:19,000
yeah,
exactly.

263
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:23,260
So about 80 percent of buildings taller 
than 12 stories don't have a 13th floor.

264
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Okay?
And so this tricks a deck of phobia is 

265
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,140
again in a free country,
if you,

266
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,900
if you want to be afraid of the number 
13,

267
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,610
go right ahead.

268
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,380
It just seems to me you should not be 
tasked with designing elevators.

269
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,950
If that's your fear.
Find something else to do.

270
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Holding aside the fact that I'm a little
scared that in this 21st century United 

271
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,640
States of America,
we have people walking among us afraid 

272
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,820
of the number 13.
What does that mean?

273
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,330
I don't know in the long run,
but if you keep to yourself,

274
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,660
don't harm others.
Think what ever you want so that the 

275
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,930
rubber hits the road is you now have 
power over others.

276
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,370
And that's where the failure of the 
educational system actually manifests.

277
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Well,
that's all societies and cultures 

278
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:17,640
collapse,
sweat,

279
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,360
but it's not that they don't know that 
there's a 13th floor and that you're 

280
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,611
just calling it the fourth.
I want to take my sharpie cross out the 

281
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:23,611
14th,
the 13th floor.

282
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:28,020
You're not fooling anybody.
Now when you see it on an elevator and 

283
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,020
you're like,
you see no,

284
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,100
13 and plus they try to fake you out.

285
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,750
So they go one,
two,

286
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,200
three,
four,

287
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:32,620
five,
six,

288
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:32,830
seven,
eight,

289
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:33,460
nine,
10,

290
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:34,480
11,
12,

291
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,930
and then you have to go to the next road
to begin to for the 14th.

292
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,800
So you'll see 12 and right next to 14 
and some other,

293
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,800
some modern buildings will put their,
their,

294
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,810
their,
uh,

295
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,850
their heavy machinery like the h vac on 
the 13th floor so that there's no 

296
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,880
residency.
Right?

297
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,750
But they could still say it's the 13th 
floor and then there's the 14 foot.

298
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,650
Does anybody ever have a dummy 13th 
button where you press it?

299
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:01,000
It never lights up.
Like I don't get it.

300
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:02,540
I can't get it.
That's interesting.

301
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,790
That's what I would do.
Oh,

302
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,000
you just put it there to satisfy me.
But still nobody lives there.

303
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,680
That's to Colorado.
This is one of the 20 percent of people 

304
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:12,680
that make sense.
This is what a great building.

305
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,510
And meanwhile there is no 13th slow.
It's just a dummy button.

306
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,130
Remember that twilight zone episode with
the mannequins?

307
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,070
They went up to the 11th floor,
but there is no 11th floor.

308
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,230
And the mannequins come to life at 
night.

309
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,120
Oh,
I forgot about that.

310
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,360
They leave the store floors and they've 
all go up to 11 and have a cocktail 

311
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,730
party and they vote,
which one of them is going to go out and

312
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:34,000
become human for a day.
A twilight zone was so good.

313
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,040
There was the best television there ever
was like still to this day ever because 

314
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,540
so many great premises,
great premises,

315
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,640
great actors,
Great Cinematography,

316
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:45,580
and it was in black and white,
so shadows were completely dark.

317
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,420
Shadows don't have much meaning when 
you're filming color because everything 

318
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,590
is just there,
but in black and white

319
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,990
shadows create moods and yeah,
so I watched to serve man.

320
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:01,910
The other hadn't seen.
I hadn't.

321
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,420
I had it on the Dvr and played lurch on 
the Adams family.

322
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,120
Yeah,
that was a great one because it was just

323
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,430
like,
it had all the elements of people going,

324
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,300
well,
you know,

325
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:18,260
they seem nice.
They seem nice and they solve all of our

326
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:23,180
war and our God.
That was great.

327
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,660
That's a good one.
Was the,

328
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,680
the invaders do to remember this one 
knew this was a.

329
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,580
This was a one woman performance and I 
forgot who it was.

330
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:35,960
It was it not agnes morehead,
one of these women of that era,

331
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,270
uh,
it'll come to me in a minute and she's 

332
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:41,270
living alone in a farm house,
no electricity.

333
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,610
She's got a farm and she's alone and 
some alien spacecraft lands on her roof 

334
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,010
and it's got these devices,
has got these saws and blazers cutting 

335
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,701
through things and she's freaking out.
She's got the pan in the pots and the 

336
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,460
rolling pin and she,
then she'd get the gun,

337
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,180
the shotgun,
and she's attacking this thing is,

338
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:07,390
and you don't know what it is.
And it's got lights and the thing and 

339
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,480
it's this tiny little thing.
It's like three inches across.

340
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,180
Right?
And it turns out that's the thing that's

341
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:13,830
attacking her.
And then she finally comes.

342
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,770
That's it.
See the little,

343
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,160
the little robot.
Okay.

344
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,740
And,
and,

345
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,060
and then I got to give you about the 
shows.

346
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,590
Forty years old.
I can give the punchline.

347
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,740
Okay.
So she actually successfully damages the

348
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:30,290
thing and then you zoom in on it,
right?

349
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:35,291
And then you hear a radio transmission 
from the aliens that are inside and it 

350
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,320
says,
um,

351
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,910
yeah.
Hello?

352
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,140
Hello?
Uh,

353
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,950
Houston

354
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,610
giant.
Who's trying to attack us?

355
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,090
We need help.
Send backups.

356
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,620
Oh,
it was great.

357
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,760
Like,
whoa.

358
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,790
We were the invaders.
That was us landing on her home on some 

359
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:57,580
other planet or some parallel earth from
some other dementia.

360
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,070
It's just a art we.
No,

361
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,860
no,
no,

362
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,340
no.
I get it.

363
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,940
So she's.
What's another planet?

364
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,970
She's the.
She's the giant where they're saying 

365
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,690
there's a giant attacking us,
but the whole show you or have her point

366
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:13,720
of view the these aliens are trying to 
hurt her.

367
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,200
When they were just.
It was our space probe just trying to 

368
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,070
explore it's environment,
but isn't it possible that it's like 

369
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,711
another dimension.
It's us in another dimension and they 

370
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,070
are landing on earth.
Excepted it.

371
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,780
No,
no.

372
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,400
I mean they were speaking English.
Parallel evolution.

373
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,840
Isn't that the definition of infinity 
that somewhere some.

374
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,780
If,
if there is really an infinity,

375
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,080
there is not only a you and an I,
but there's a uni and everybody else 

376
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,051
we've ever met in all the exact events 
in the exact same order have gone down 

377
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:49,890
an infinite number of times.
This conversation

378
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,110
except except there is how many people 
know this,

379
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,140
but often it's mind blowing when you 
learn that some infinities are bigger 

380
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,971
than others.
Joe Rogan just lean two feet away from 

381
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:10,920
the microphone.
Not all affinities are the same size.

382
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,570
It's infinity then it's infinity.
It's okay.

383
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,180
Don't you remember when you were a kid 
and said,

384
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:17,940
what's the biggest number?
You know,

385
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:19,640
a million or a million and one.
Right?

386
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,030
Okay.
How about a billion?

387
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,370
A billion and one knew the annoying kid 
was added.

388
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:23,610
One.
Two,

389
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,690
okay.
How about infinity,

390
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,440
infinity and one day?
Well,

391
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,160
turn to offending anyone and affinity or
the same number?

392
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,150
Okay.
So here's the.

393
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,740
So for example,
the number of,

394
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,950
of counting numbers.
So one,

395
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,670
two,
three,

396
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,200
up to infinity.
Okay.

397
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,290
Right.
The numbers you would use to count 

398
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,290
things,
that's infinite.

399
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,180
The number of irrational numbers.
So the numbers that you cannot represent

400
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:52,740
as a fraction.
Okay.

401
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,840
That there's more there,
more of those than there are counting 

402
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,540
numbers by far.
So these are orders of infinity.

403
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,610
Then there are more,
there are more transcendental numbers.

404
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,490
Then there are irrational numbers.
What's a transcendental numbers?

405
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,850
So that's a number that you'll never 
find as a solution to,

406
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,420
to an Algebraic equation.
So Pi is a transcendental,

407
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,250
number B is a transcendent.
These,

408
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,280
these are magic numbers that show up in 
mathematics and there's turns out 

409
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,850
there's like an even bigger infinity of 
those than there is of these other two 

410
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,170
classes of numbers.
And they use the,

411
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,940
the,
the,

412
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,680
um,
the Hebrew letter,

413
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,370
uh,
less,

414
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,110
uh,
in,

415
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,310
in,
in ranking.

416
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,430
So as I left,
one left,

417
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,590
two left,
three elephants.

418
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,240
I think there are five levels of 
infinity.

419
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,330
So my point is I'm just,
because there's infinite universes to 

420
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,171
me,
doesn't mean there's infinite 

421
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:55,341
conversations that have happened and I'd
want to really explore the depths of 

422
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:59,301
infinities before I say and agree with 
you that this conversation has happened 

423
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:02,580
a million,
an infinite number of times in just this

424
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:07,581
way,
except you have a different engineers 

425
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,211
sitting next to us,
a or an infinite number of times where 

426
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:09,211
it's been Jamie too,
right?

427
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:09,990
Yeah.
In principle.

428
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,150
I mean,
that's the argument that's given,

429
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,300
but I think that there's some nested 
infinities in there that deserve some 

430
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,081
explanation.
My explanation is not handling this 

431
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:21,081
well.
Well that's,

432
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:22,170
that's fine.
As I've said,

433
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,030
as I say in the,
in the,

434
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,420
in the,
uh,

435
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,460
epigraph of,
uh,

436
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,690
of the book booked is not available yet,
but I have a copy,

437
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:33,150
ha ha.
Astrophysicists for people in a hurry.

438
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,800
Astrophysics for people in a hurry.
But you got to say,

439
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,170
Hey,
let's just say astrophysics for people 

440
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,170
in a hurry.
Oh yes.

441
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,530
A quick.
You got to say,

442
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,370
Hey,
because you're in a hurry.

443
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,510
So,
so the EPA,

444
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,510
the EPA,
the EPA,

445
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:51,511
Graham on that is the universe is under 
no obligation to make sense to you that 

446
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,160
that's Rasha.
And I did that before.

447
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,580
And so it makes sense to you that the 
universe is under no obligation to make 

448
00:20:59,580 --> 00:20:59,580
sense.

449
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,840
So it's okay if your brain hurts when I 
say there's a ranking of infinities,

450
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,200
but um,
but you shouldn't say that doesn't make 

451
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,200
sense.
Therefore it is not true.

452
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,760
I definitely wouldn't say that.
But what confuses me is the word 

453
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,550
infinity because I had always taken the 
word infinity to mean something that has

454
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:17,551
no end.
So how can something that has no end be 

455
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:18,070
larger than something else.
So the way they do that mathematically,

456
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,560
the way to demonstrate that 
mathematically is used.

457
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,630
You map one item in the set of this 
infinity to corresponding items in the 

458
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:28,810
set or the oven.
Other infinity.

459
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:34,030
So you do this.
So you take the one and you map it to 

460
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,270
like the first transcendental number six
a to two.

461
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,330
The second you just keep doing this.
And when you do that mathematically what

462
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,520
you find that one infinity outstrips the
other infinity.

463
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,530
Wow.
And then you left with more,

464
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,260
with more numbers.
So that shows you that you have a bigger

465
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:50,230
infinity.
Now when you find,

466
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:55,231
I mean there's a,
there's a new NASA announcement that's 

467
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,351
supposed to.
Is it Monday that's supposed to be 

468
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:58,750
announced or types of plans tomorrow?
The exoplanet is a Wednesday,

469
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,170
a Wednesday.
I don't,

470
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I don't have a secret.
I'm not authorized to have juicy 

471
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:09,550
details.
Let me invent some juicy details that it

472
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:10,480
could be.
So NASA.

473
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,480
So.
So He's been good at segwaying lately.

474
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:14,660
He doesn't,
he just jumping in,

475
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,340
jumping out.
You got to get that red.

476
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:19,180
I just,
yeah,

477
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:24,181
I'm flying back to.
Thanks for fitting this in show it 

478
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:24,320
opened this place up at three in the 
morning for you,

479
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,070
man.
No,

480
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:25,930
I'm,
I'm very,

481
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:26,830
um,
I feel the love.

482
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,190
So thank you.
Um,

483
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,130
so,
uh,

484
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,520
here's some things that could be because
NASA is saying that it's,

485
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,280
it's a,
it's a stunning new announcement.

486
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,530
Well,
what could be more than the fact that we

487
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:41,230
already know that there are,
uh,

488
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,320
there are earth like planets orbiting in
the goldilocks zone of the nearest star 

489
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:48,640
to the sun.
Proximate Century.

490
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,040
Can you do better that than that?
For me?

491
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,750
NASA?
I don't think so.

492
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,200
Unless you got some extra stuff you're 
going to tell us.

493
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Like what's been a cottage industry in 
the last couple of years is the 

494
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,301
observation of planet atmospheres.
As the planet passes in front of the 

495
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:10,921
host star life from the host star passes
through the atmosphere and it is all and

496
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:15,370
the light signatures altered by the 
chemistry of the atmosphere.

497
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,730
So depending what the chemicals are,
it'll influence the spectrum that you 

498
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,370
get.
And when you do that,

499
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:26,371
you can say what the chemical 
composition of the atmosphere of that 

500
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:26,371
star is.
There's certain,

501
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,740
there's a certain combinations of 
elements that we would call biomarkers.

502
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
No,
we can't look down to the surface of the

503
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,280
planet and look at cities if there are 
any.

504
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,670
But there are consequences in the 
atmosphere to there being life on the 

505
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,680
surface such as is there oxygen there.
I used to think when I was watching star

506
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:47,660
trek when I was a kid,
because I saw it in real time.

507
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:49,210
That's an old.
I am a.

508
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,310
When it first came out,
original series star trek characters 

509
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,940
never wore spacesuits.
Yeah.

510
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,100
You ever wonder.
I mean,

511
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,760
you ever thought about that?
Okay.

512
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,370
What happens is they visit planets that 
have nitrogen,

513
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:02,660
oxygen atmosphere.
Jim.

514
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,580
All right,
well that's what our atmosphere is.

515
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:06,410
Nitrogen.
So they find planets with nitrogen,

516
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,400
oxygen.
They go down,

517
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:12,401
they don't need a space suit.
So I've actually thought about that and 

518
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:15,371
that's their solution.
So that must mean there'd be planets 

519
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:15,371
that you could find that.

520
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,790
Well,
here's the thing,

521
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,590
we have oxygen on earth only because 
there is life on earth.

522
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,920
Not any kind of life,
photosynthesizing life,

523
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,190
we have life that takes sunlight,
turns it into chemical energy,

524
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,000
into itself,
into wood,

525
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:35,840
into plants,
and one of its byproducts is oxygen.

526
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:41,000
Oxygen is chemically active.
If you took away all plants tomorrow,

527
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,340
that oxygen would slowly get absorbed 
chemically into the environment and then

528
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:49,370
you would not have oxygen there to be 
viewed by aliens.

529
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:54,371
Trying to see if we have life here.
And it's pretty surprising to people to 

530
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:54,940
note that we're mostly nitrogen in.
All right.

531
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,390
Oh yeah.
We're.

532
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,700
We're 78 percent nitrogen in our 
atmosphere.

533
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Toy.
You know what happens if you have too 

534
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,451
much oxygen?
If you have like let's say 50 percent 

535
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:06,880
oxygen and that part of it,
no one knew.

536
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,710
What happens is like a forest fire would
never go out.

537
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,740
Oh yeah.
Because oxygen feeds combustion and so 

538
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,850
you could basically burn all vegetation 
in the world if the oxygen went above 

539
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,391
certain thresholds.
So you needed high enough so that you 

540
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:26,021
can still have oxygen metabolism but not
so high that it's bad for lightening 

541
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,890
triggered forest fires.
But my point is so,

542
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,190
so if,
if in this,

543
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,290
if I don't know the announcement,
but I'm just guessing here because it's 

544
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:35,540
been a cottage industry the last couple 
of years,

545
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:40,690
let's find these biomarkers.
Do you have unstable chemistry going on 

546
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,410
in that atmosphere?
Because if you do,

547
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,740
it means something's generating it and 
certain combinations of chemistry tells 

548
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,120
you there's likely to be life of some 
kind.

549
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,130
Now,
just a couple of decades ago,

550
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:57,131
we had speculation of other planets,
but we really didn't have any tangible 

551
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:57,830
proof.
In fact,

552
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,020
anyone,
anytime I give a public talk,

553
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,640
you can do this.
You are in your gigs,

554
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,400
asked who he was born since 1995.

555
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,640
Okay?
And you,

556
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,250
uh,
you,

557
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,730
you,
your audience leans young.

558
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,880
So there'll be some fraction of the 
audience will raise their hand.

559
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,240
And so what I do is I,
I night them as generation exoplanet 

560
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,660
because 1995 was the first year that,
that a planet outside of our own solar 

561
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,551
system was discovered.
So they have been alive only during a 

562
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:28,400
time where we've known each other star 
systems.

563
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,460
So crazy generation x.
that's what I want to start that 

564
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:33,860
movement.
It's so crazy.

565
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,420
That's so recent.
I mean,

566
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:35,810
it is.
Yeah.

567
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,040
Oh yeah.
I was living out here.

568
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,770
It's 20 was 24 years ago.
Was 22 years ago.

569
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:41,390
Yeah,
that's insane.

570
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,250
If you stop and think about how,
what a short period of time that is,

571
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,450
and in that period of time when there's 
rising through 3000 exoplanets,

572
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,300
this was the advance of that.
That's not just science events,

573
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,490
that's engineering and technology and in
telescope quality and imaging quality.

574
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,670
And it is a lot that goes on to the 
advance of science.

575
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:02,850
It's not just how clever you are in an 
Einsteinian way.

576
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,120
It's,
do you know good engineers to build a 

577
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,850
device to make the measurement?
This is how we discovered gravity waves.

578
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,420
Now what's your take on that planet 
that's supposed to be outside the Kuyper

579
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:15,840
belt?
That's planet planet nine so far.

580
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,470
All the data look convincing.
So what they've done is they've looked 

581
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,110
at other objects in the Kuiper belt and 
looked at.

582
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,080
These are colleagues of mine at Caltech.
Um,

583
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,490
so it's,
it's uh,

584
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,790
Mike Brown who,
you know,

585
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,430
I get blamed for killing Pluto,
but I was an accessory for sure,

586
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:35,220
but I definitely didn't kill blue.
That dude killed Pluto,

587
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,420
right.
He found another object that was 

588
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,411
basically the size of pluto out there.
So either you make that a planet where 

589
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:42,930
you demote Pluto.

590
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,610
And how much smaller is Pluto there 
onsite?

591
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:45,420
Our Moon.
Oh,

592
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:47,250
so,
so don't get me started.

593
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,800
Our movement has five times the mass of 
Pluto.

594
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,720
Wow.
So the moon,

595
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,640
Pluto was lame from the beginning.
All right.

596
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,120
We thought it was big.
We wanted it to be big.

597
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:57,970
We,
we,

598
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,950
we,
we made it,

599
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:03,951
one of us,
one of the nine and its size didn't 

600
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:06,240
settle out until the late 19 seventies 
when we had better and better,

601
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:11,241
more accurate ways to measure its size.
And that's when we learned it's small 

602
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:11,310
even compared to our own.
But granted,

603
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:16,311
we have a big moon,
but if you're not going to think our 

604
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:16,490
moon is a planet,
you're certainly not going to think that

605
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,670
Pluto was a planet.
So,

606
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,050
so this,
let me just tell you how they did.

607
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:20,790
So they found these other objects out 
there,

608
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,570
the same team,
I'm a constant team back together,

609
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,460
pronounce his last name,
but in Jan and Mike Brown,

610
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,360
but both at Caltech and they found these
objects in the outer,

611
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,930
so the Kuyper belt of icy bodies,
of which Pluto is a member.

612
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,600
You track their motion and you say,
okay,

613
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,570
if I add up all the gravity that's 
affecting them and they should move this

614
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:43,590
way,
but they don't.

615
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:45,750
They move another way,
a different way.

616
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,230
So either Newton's laws of gravity are 
failing in the outer solar system or 

617
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,341
this some object out there whose gravity
you have yet to reconcile with the 

618
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:56,520
motions of these objects.
So they said,

619
00:28:56,521 --> 00:29:01,521
let's assume Newton is right.
What object we have to put out there at 

620
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:06,081
what distance and what size to influence
the movement of these copper belt 

621
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:08,160
objects in the way we see it.
And then they do this to bodes law.

622
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,240
No,
no.

623
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,870
We're way pat went up later.
Thanks for remembering boats law,

624
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:17,871
but both law was a early a measure of 
where you might find a new planet and it

625
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:19,760
was based on mass and gravity.
No,

626
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:22,710
no,
both law was a simple arithmetic tool.

627
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:28,010
All it did was basically double the 
distance with a certain additive 

628
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,290
parameter,
double the distance of the planet.

629
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,020
So for example,
um,

630
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,920
uh,
and,

631
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,650
and there was a little a factor in there
that helped the inner planets come out.

632
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:38,970
Right?
But let's look at Maurice.

633
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:42,460
Maurice was like two and a half times 
earth's distance from the sun.

634
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,500
Uh,
what comes after Mars?

635
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,240
Jupiter,
Jupiter is five times or assistance.

636
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,890
Saturn is 10 times two and two and a 
half to five to 10.

637
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,460
So bolds law is just a simple arithmetic
scheme.

638
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,920
It's not based in any known physics.
It was only based on the solar system.

639
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,410
It's under social system itself.
That's right.

640
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:04,411
So,
and it worked and yet you have to fudge 

641
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,250
your way to get mercury to work in.
That wouldn't,

642
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,930
didn't have pluto.
Pluto wasn't a planet in any way,

643
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,920
but anyhow it was a,
it was a flood Gigi way.

644
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,250
That was mostly right by accident and 
this was in like,

645
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,570
what year was this?
Oh,

646
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:18,270
that was a,
uh,

647
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,040
1800 spaces.
Yeah.

648
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,500
So now we have advanced computer 
programming,

649
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,680
very high precision modeling,
and they're saying there's got to be a 

650
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
planet somewhere here in this arc of the
sky,

651
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:34,710
let's look for it because we think 
that's what's effected the orbits of 

652
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,171
these other objects and that is a 
completely noble way to discover a 

653
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:37,900
planet.
That's how Neptune was discovered.

654
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,230
And because everyone looked at the orbit
of Uranus and said,

655
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:45,280
you know,
Uranus is not following Newton's laws.

656
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Maybe.
Maybe Newton's laws don't work that far 

657
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:50,640
out.
He's never been tested that far.

658
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:50,640
And they said,
well,

659
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,870
let's,
let's assume it works and ask what would

660
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:57,871
have to influence it and whether it's a 
difficult mathematical calculation 

661
00:30:57,871 --> 00:30:58,120
because you're not saying,
here's the object.

662
00:30:58,121 --> 00:30:59,590
What's the gravity field?

663
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,890
You're saying,
here's the gravity field I need.

664
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,000
Where must the object be and how massive
must've be.

665
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,850
That's a much harder mathematical 
problem to solve.

666
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,030
And so once the,
the,

667
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,120
the,
the errant orbit of Uranus was known and

668
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:23,131
calculated,
they started looking for another planet 

669
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:23,680
and that's how they discovered planet 
Neptune.

670
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,830
Wow.
So now when they're looking at this 

671
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:28,830
planet nine,
hope I said that right?

672
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,670
It was the,
the movement of Uranus's orbit was not 

673
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,490
following proper laws.
And they infer the presence of Neptune.

674
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,470
They said,
look here tomorrow night.

675
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,020
And they look there and they found it.
Wow.

676
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,360
Yes.
It was a brilliant display of.

677
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,650
No,
we're going back to the 19th century.

678
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:46,120
So I mean,
people,

679
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,870
people were bad ass at every 
generation's got their bad ass.

680
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:54,871
Scientists know how much further out 
from the known solar system is this 

681
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:59,220
unknown planet.
So I'm not quick to call it planet nine 

682
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,570
because so far it's 20,000
times farther away from the sun than the

683
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:02,050
earth is.

684
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,000
So I'm not sorry you're not in the 
family.

685
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,060
You're not in the hood.
No,

686
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,690
sorry.
I'm not feeling like Colin Connecticut,

687
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:12,370
New York City.
I'm not feeling it.

688
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,010
And so.
But it's something massive,

689
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:16,750
right?
It's like six times the mass of the.

690
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:18,940
I forgot what mass they were assigning 
it,

691
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:20,170
but yeah,
it would.

692
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,020
If that were in our solar system,
do we?

693
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:27,021
No question.
You would label it as a planet and it 

694
00:32:27,021 --> 00:32:29,221
wasn't there one time,
speculation that it was some sort of a 

695
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:29,480
burnt out star that exist.
Not that mass.

696
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,040
No,
no,

697
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:30,310
no,
no,

698
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,430
no.
You might be thinking you if that's what

699
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:37,431
I think you're thinking.
You got good memory too long ago in a 

700
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:39,440
galaxy far away,
so I'm talking about 19 seventies people

701
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:42,860
looked at the extinction record on earth
and every 20,000

702
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,230
years they found a little blip,
a little dip,

703
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,590
and the fossil record where we lost some
species and people were wondering why 

704
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,450
could there have been some flux of 
comets raining down periodically on the 

705
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,750
earth wreaking havoc on the ecosystem 
rendering species extinct in these 

706
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:01,750
periodic intervals.

707
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,550
So if there is,
maybe there's some double star to the 

708
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,260
sun,
some binary star system.

709
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,840
So they invoked it and then they called 
it.

710
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:14,630
They gave him a name or they called it 
nemesis when God gave it a name.

711
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,840
And so you know what period?
Orbital period.

712
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:22,841
That object must have,
it's got to match the extinction 

713
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:23,600
periodicity and so it's got to be a 
20,000

714
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,930
year period and so.
But people look for it,

715
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:31,931
they couldn't find it and then you 
reanalyze the extinction records and it 

716
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,550
was,
you had to fudge it to make it look like

717
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:37,430
it was periodic.
So basically we've abandoned the idea of

718
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:41,170
net of nemesis and aren't binary star 
systems really common.

719
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:46,171
Yeah.
More than half the star as you've seen 

720
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:46,171
the night sky or binary or multiple 
systems.

721
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:47,330
In fact,
the iconic image from Star Wars,

722
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,090
the original star wars movie before they
numbered them,

723
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,180
I think.
What would star wars for?

724
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:54,670
Well,
yeah,

725
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,940
whatever,
whatever that that,

726
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
that,
that desert planet that Luke was on and 

727
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,270
he comes out after visiting his was 
what?

728
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,110
The step parent?
No,

729
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:05,970
his adoptive parents.
I don't remember whoever,

730
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:11,030
wherever he was visiting,
he comes out and you see a double 

731
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,331
sunset.
So that's basically the only accurate 

732
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:15,550
science and the entire series star wars 
series.

733
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,840
I really enjoy taking a part of gravity 
gravity and how many people got mad at 

734
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,890
me,
so I stopped coming.

735
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:29,891
Come movies.
I don't need to Piss people off when I 

736
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:31,040
watched your movie.
I'm having those thoughts anyway,

737
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,190
so I might as well share them with 
people if you're interested.

738
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,620
So I did just that.
And then people.

739
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,510
The last time I did it was for Star 
Wars,

740
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,790
the force awakens,
Star Wars seven.

741
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,980
I had a series of tweets,
you know,

742
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,790
one of them was um,
Bba,

743
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,850
a smooth rolling metal spherical ball 
would have skidded uncontrollably on 

744
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:51,920
sand.

745
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,840
People got angry.
Someone tweeted back,

746
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,710
shut the fuck up.
Okay.

747
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,310
That's.
So.

748
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,820
So I said,
okay,

749
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:04,490
I'm not here to get people angry.
I'm just here to enlightened,

750
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:07,370
to help people enhance their movie going
experience.

751
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,560
But to the extent that is not 
accomplishing this,

752
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,170
I don't need to do it.
I'm just saying I don't.

753
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm an educator.
I thought I was being nice.

754
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,630
I don't need to do.
So I haven't tweeted about a movie since

755
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:19,860
then.
I got to stop.

756
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:24,861
You.
See I have tweets I can post about 

757
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:25,880
arrival.
Please give us a little bit of a shutter

758
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:26,690
off.
Okay.

759
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,880
Now you've got to give it a chance.
I,

760
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,930
as soon as I see a movie that starts 
out,

761
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:30,860
I don't,
spoiler alert,

762
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,330
starts out with a sick kid.
I'm like,

763
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,140
fuck you.
No,

764
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,780
no,
no,

765
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,240
no.
In fact,

766
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:36,410
it's very not about the kid.

767
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,640
I'm sure that's what I keep is totally 
not about the kid.

768
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,170
Jamie hated it.
Oh yeah.

769
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,980
Oh yeah.
So you just give it a chance.

770
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,890
But anyhow,
so I just stopped.

771
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,420
Maybe I'll come back,
but I'm.

772
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,600
Yeah,
and people need to know the gravity.

773
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:55,260
That was good that you explained that 
not only is it's not plausible,

774
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,390
those two satellites on anywhere near 
each other.

775
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:57,960
They're like,
Gosh.

776
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:58,860
We're said,
oh,

777
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:03,861
there's the,
there's the international space station 

778
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:04,730
and I'm on the Chinese space station.
Let me just jet pack my wave.

779
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,520
Do you really?
Excuse me lady.

780
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Hey Lady.
Do you know how far away these are from 

781
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,391
one another.
You can just jet around from one space 

782
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:17,391
station to another.
No,

783
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:20,780
can't do it there.
Tens of thousands of miles from one 

784
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:20,780
another for goodness sake.
So,

785
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,430
but anyhow,
so I,

786
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,600
yeah,
you remember the tweet?

787
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,840
It was like 15 tweets and I didn't know 
that was when I realized like the press 

788
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,840
was reading my movie tweets and those 
tweets.

789
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,040
There's now a couple of years ago when 
gravity came out with Sandra bullock 

790
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,040
and,
and,

791
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,090
and um,
uh,

792
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,290
what's the dude's name?
George Clooney.

793
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,000
So I tweeted it and they got talked 
about on the,

794
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,940
on the today show,
set the set,

795
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,980
the weekend today show on NBC.
Then it was talked about on NBC nightly 

796
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,301
news.
Then my tweets were talking about on 

797
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:56,301
Saturday night lives,
the weekend update.

798
00:36:56,301 --> 00:37:00,390
It was like the NBC Trifecta and I said,
oh my gosh,

799
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,620
this was,
had not,

800
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,340
that was not the point.
I didn't seek this if fine,

801
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:10,341
I'm glad they,
they are reacting this way because that 

802
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:10,341
means they care about the science may 
be.

803
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,200
But what?
Seth Meyers there,

804
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,980
because he was doing weekend update at 
the time,

805
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:18,981
he said a astrophysicist Neil degrasse 
station harshly criticized the movie 

806
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:23,511
gravity a saying has,
contains a number of scientific and 

807
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:23,511
accuracies,
for example.

808
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:28,540
There is no way George Clooney would 
have spent that much time talking to a 

809
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,980
woman his own age.
That's hilarious.

810
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,230
I think Sandra bullock's still younger 
than George Clooney though.

811
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,590
They should've got their facts,
but not.

812
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:37,470
Yeah,
but not by much.

813
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:37,890
I mean,
yeah,

814
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:39,510
there were.
There were in the same neighborhood.

815
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,600
Yeah.
I think it's important.

816
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,450
I think that you enjoy the movie.
It's great,

817
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:48,600
it's fun and everything like that,
but it's important to point out what the

818
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,610
science areas are.
I think I,

819
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,890
I think that the,
I think the movie could have done 

820
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:55,890
better.
Honestly.

821
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:55,890
I thinks they could have made the same 
movie.

822
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,700
People thought I didn't like the movie 
when all I was doing was pointing out 

823
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:01,700
things they got wrong.
By the way.

824
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,390
They did some stunning things correctly.
For example,

825
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,440
this was,
this is brilliant.

826
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,660
If you're in zero g a fire basically 
puts itself out.

827
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,470
So think about when you burn a candle on
earth.

828
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,800
Uh,
so you liked the wick at this.

829
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,730
People have candles anymore.
They forgot what a candle.

830
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:23,010
You light it with a match that you used 
to get from smoking lounges at bars.

831
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:29,650
All right,
so you light the candle and it stays 

832
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,060
lit.
The fuel is the wax.

833
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,540
The oxygen continually comes in because 
it heats the air around it and the air 

834
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:40,771
rises,
hot air rises and fresh air comes in 

835
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:40,780
from below.
It has fresh oxygen,

836
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,470
so the candles stayed lit until it burns
all the way down in space.

837
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,930
If you light a candle,
you can light the candle.

838
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:52,170
It'll heat the air,
but the air will not know where to go 

839
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,380
because it's not lighter than everything
because it's in zero g,

840
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,730
it'll stake clustered around the candle.
The candle will use up all the oxygen in

841
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,830
that bubble and then it'll put itself 
out.

842
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,750
They did this in the movie,
so why do they have some good science?

843
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,780
Because they make.
You can't think of everything so they 

844
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:09,780
just have you on.
Staff will know they can.

845
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,260
You know,
she couldn't think of anything if I.

846
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,380
So you can't think of everything.
So I wasn't judgemental so much as this 

847
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,281
movie.
The fact that it got so much right is 

848
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:22,600
what put it on my map to criticize what 
it got wrong.

849
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,380
That makes sense at.
Does that make they make you older hair?

850
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,150
Her bangs should've been floating,
floating all over.

851
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,300
Now you might think,
am I the nitpicky?

852
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,330
No,
because we will get any picture of 

853
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:39,330
somebody with hair.
Okay.

854
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,260
In space in zero g there.
Here is flying everywhere.

855
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:42,790
It's the first thing you notice about 
them.

856
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,530
It is so obvious.
Like,

857
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:45,390
wow,
that's the coolest.

858
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,550
You're not thinking about the spaceship 
or the tie technology.

859
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,700
You're looking at the hair doing stuff 
you will never see happen on earth 

860
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,970
unless someone is like underwater and 
they're jiggling their head.

861
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,280
So they would have to film it all in 
zero gravity.

862
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:59,200
They would have to film it on when those
drop things.

863
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:04,201
Yeah.
Or to drop thing and they'd have to be 

864
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:04,201
clever about it.
And she only had bangs.

865
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,920
That's all you had to figure out how to.
They did other clever things.

866
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,410
So anyway,
that's all I did play by the way.

867
00:40:08,411 --> 00:40:11,020
In all fairness to movies,
I'll call out something that's good.

868
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,630
The science,
that movie got right.

869
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,250
That otherwise got no science,
right?

870
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,670
I'll be the first in line to do that.
Like what?

871
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,790
Oh uh,
in the movie monsters inc.

872
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,380
Oh my gosh.
YOu didn't think I was going there.

873
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,370
Did you?
Uh,

874
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,600
those doors were four dimensional 
portals to,

875
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,230
to another.

876
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,990
That's possible.
Well,

877
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,240
if you had four dimensions,
that's what it would look like.

878
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,240
Do you remember the movie opened?
They take the doors home?

879
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,360
Yes.
They opened the door and they're in the 

880
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,700
closet of the kid that they're going to 
terrorize.

881
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,070
Yes.
That's a wormhole.

882
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:50,380
That's what that is.
What access to the fourth dimension 

883
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,711
looks like?
Do You think scientifically that's 

884
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:52,711
possible one day?
I hope so.

885
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:56,140
I hope so because here's the example.
We've got a nice broad desk.

886
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,940
We hear it that at this interview,
right?

887
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,210
So desk is two dimensions.
It's got length and width and I can 

888
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,961
start putting papers on this desk and I 
can lay them out mosaic style and then 

889
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,300
all of a sudden I have no more room to 
put a sheet of paper.

890
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,540
If I'm an aunt living in the surface of 
the desk,

891
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,950
I say,
no more room,

892
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:21,090
but wait a minute,
we are three dimensional people and I 

893
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,821
can put an organizer and stack things 
vertically so I can take a sheet of 

894
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:28,660
paper and now I can put it higher up 
than the surface of the desk.

895
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,610
The aunt will say,
where Did it go?

896
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,320
Oh my gosh.
It disappeared in some portal.

897
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,370
We're no,
no.

898
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:35,240
What?
What is that?

899
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,300
It went into the third dimension and the
ant bound and obviously as a three 

900
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,430
dimensional thing,
imagine it only lives in two dimensions.

901
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,850
You would have made that paper disappear
into a third dimension and it will have 

902
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,931
no clue where it went because you had a 
portal you had access to that extra 

903
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:58,031
dimension.
So look at how much you can store on a 

904
00:41:58,031 --> 00:42:00,350
desk when you have access to a third 
dimension above it,

905
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,720
vastly more than just papers mosaic out 
on the surface.

906
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,320
So now let's up this example by a 
dimension.

907
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,770
You're storing boxes in a room or I ran 
out of room.

908
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,350
No you didn't.
Let's open this four dimensional door.

909
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,260
You open it,
put the boxes through the door,

910
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:22,690
close the door box has gone,
there'll be awesome for hoarders.

911
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,180
You,
you,

912
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:28,181
uh,
you look around the other side of the 

913
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:28,181
bar,
the door,

914
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:28,181
there's nothing there,
right?

915
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:28,310
The,
yoUr side of the door,

916
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:33,311
nothing there.
It's just a door that is a portal to a 

917
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:36,071
fourth dimension that can hold vastly 
more content than what is what you're 

918
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:39,350
stuck storing in the three dimensional 
space of your room.

919
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,440
Now that's so the tense of brilliant 
concept and even though it has monsters 

920
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,191
that don't exist that all speak english 
and is one of them is a cycle ops and 

921
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,191
one of them is a,
you know,

922
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,540
I'm not judging the biophysiology of 
these creatures,

923
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,720
but they got the physics of,
of four dimensional portals completely 

924
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,921
accurate.
Now the concept of dimensions is where 

925
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:02,951
it gets really abstract with pete,
I love me some dimensions and it is 

926
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:02,951
abstract.
It is,

927
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:07,670
and that's why you take.
Let the math take you into those higher 

928
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,670
dimensions because our intuition will 
not,

929
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,790
will fail for us.

930
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,050
RighT?
But that's where it gets weird.

931
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,750
When you say take the math,
let them take you.

932
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:17,980
So like when quantum physicists use 
these legal notepads,

933
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,650
those yellow pads and write all that 
crazy stuff down that nobody but you and

934
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:24,860
maybe them understand and when you look 
at all those equations,

935
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,430
no,
it's them,

936
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:29,870
maybe me.
Then you probably understand it,

937
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,640
right?
But I definitely don't.

938
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,700
My point is What are they exactly?
Figuring out that allows them to say 

939
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:38,600
there are.
I think they say,

940
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,300
well at one point in time was 11,
but I think they've expanded that,

941
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:42,270
right?
What they say,

942
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,590
I don't have the latest dimension count 
on the universe,

943
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:51,010
but what the way it works is you.
You're trying to make sense of the 

944
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,170
world.
Right?

945
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,800
And so you take some leaps.
So some,

946
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,740
some philosophical leafs leaps,
some mathematical leaps.

947
00:43:57,741 --> 00:43:58,910
You say,
alright,

948
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,690
may be all particles that manifests as 
an electronic proton,

949
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,190
a neutral may,
but the quarks,

950
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,490
maybe they are just strings of energy 
vibrating at different frequencies and 

951
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:17,120
we sense these different frequencies as 
different particles.

952
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,640
Let's just go there for me.
Well,

953
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:21,920
if you're going to do that,
what are the consequences to it?

954
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,520
Then?
And how many dimensions do these 

955
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,100
vibrating strings require to have the 
properties that we see in our 

956
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,010
dimensionality.
So,

957
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,160
so the exercise of explaining what you 
see takes you to places that you've 

958
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,910
never been before.
And that's fine.

959
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,040
Places at intellectual places that 
you've,

960
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,100
that had been previously unplumbed.
There's nothing wrong with that.

961
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:49,790
We've done that before we.
That's why we know what is happening in 

962
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:50,460
the center of the sun.
Have we ever been there?

963
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,080
No.
No,

964
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,950
but we know how matter behaves under 
pressure and temperature.

965
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,400
We can do that in a laboratory.
We've got a son sitting out there with a

966
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:01,440
surface temperature,
a mass,

967
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,780
a certain luminosity,
and we'd say,

968
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:08,781
what must be going on down in the core?
let's bring our best physics or quantum 

969
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:09,560
physics,
our,

970
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,390
our chemistry,
our nuclear physics,

971
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:17,450
bring it all together and we have a 
complete understanding of what's going 

972
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:17,450
on in the center of the sun.

973
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,520
And we're on to other problems now even 
though we've never visited there.

974
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,880
So when they're going over this math,
the mathematics and observable things 

975
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,080
that we have right now or at like the 
atomic and subatomic level.

976
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:28,610
Correct?
We don't,

977
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,840
you can't see,
do you realize the electron?

978
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,470
Uh,
just uh,

979
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,120
okay.
So I met,

980
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,200
I did a whole series of this.
There's something calleD the great 

981
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,771
courses lecture series was a sponsor of 
this podcast for awhile with a really 

982
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,240
great courses.
So cool.

983
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:50,390
So I was once invited to be one of their
professors for the great courses and I 

984
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:54,510
taught a very short,
most of them are like 30 lectures.

985
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:59,490
It's like a whole college semester,
so I don't have the time and the energy.

986
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:04,670
So they let me do like short bits.
So one of them is only six parts and 

987
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,781
it's called the inexplicably universe 
and it's six parts of everything about 

988
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:13,050
which we know nothing in this university
you might say,

989
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:17,790
well that's a pretty easy course to get 
dark matter having a clue.

990
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,070
okay.
Onto the next lecture might be something

991
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:22,800
dark matter could be some we don't know.
Stay tuned.

992
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,040
So,
but it's interesting to learn how we 

993
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,920
come to know what we don't know.
And so it's,

994
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:32,650
it's an exploration of our ignorance and
I'm very proud of it because it's,

995
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,000
it's not what you'd normally find in a 
lecture series and it's still,

996
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:41,001
it's still out there,
but one of the things I will tell you 

997
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:41,001
that in,
and I'll tell you now,

998
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:44,840
the electron has no known dimension.
It is smaller than the smallest we have 

999
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,480
ever had the capacity to measure.
So as far as we concerned,

1000
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,820
it is infinitely small.
Whoa.

1001
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:57,240
We have no way to even know how to 
measure.

1002
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,130
By the way,
how do you measure something small?

1003
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:04,131
You geT something smaller and find out 
how many of those it is no.

1004
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,840
about no.
Thinking about the challenges at each 

1005
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:14,840
extreme.

1006
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,460
Asked me how big is the universe?
And I'll say it's as big as well,

1007
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,800
I got nothing.
What am I going to say?

1008
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,320
right.
There's nothing as big as the universe.

1009
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,340
So at the biggest and in at the littlest
end,

1010
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:30,700
there's not something else.
It doesn't work as well.

1011
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:36,030
Okay.
To try to say what it is relative to 

1012
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,001
something else.
Do you entertain the possibility that 

1013
00:47:39,001 --> 00:47:39,001
the biggest and the littlest end of the 
same thing,

1014
00:47:39,001 --> 00:47:42,640
meaning that at are the smallest 
measurable point that literally might be

1015
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:45,140
a whole nother universe that might be 
fracked.

1016
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,120
It's fun to think about it all the way 
down.

1017
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,390
It's fun to think about again,
phonetically down like down or whatever,

1018
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,440
and people,
by the way,

1019
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:58,590
in the 19 twenties when we discovered 
the atom and it's structure and that 

1020
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,450
there's an electron in orbit around a 
nucleus.

1021
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,040
It was at way we'd been there before.

1022
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,980
We got planets orbiting the sun and so 
this,

1023
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,890
this,
so maybe it's a mini solar system.

1024
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,860
Maybe it's,
it's solar systems all the way down.

1025
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,000
Well,
I'm glad you brought this up.

1026
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,670
I'm glad we brought this up because I 
wanted to bring this question.

1027
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:20,671
I almost forgot there's a photograph of 
a brain cell and side by side with a 

1028
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:24,360
photograph of the known universe and 
they look eerily similar to.

1029
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,710
Are you talking about the large scale 
structure of the universe?

1030
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,290
Scale of galaxies.
So I'll get to that in a minute.

1031
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,670
Hold that up jamie.
OkaY,

1032
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:34,810
so I'll get to that.
so do you ever tell him just pull up his

1033
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,250
own damn images?
Yeah,

1034
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,370
but I can't put it on the tv.
Said he has To do it.

1035
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,900
So you a.
So here's why.

1036
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,230
That's not likely.
Okay.

1037
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,040
It was an entertained idea,
but here's why it's not likely.

1038
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:57,150
The manifestation of the laws of physics
are different at the atomic scale than 

1039
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:02,290
they are at the macroscopic scale to 
just simply different.

1040
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,880
A planet can take any orbit sensible for
its velocity around a host star.

1041
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,770
An electron cannot.
It's energy levels are predetermined and

1042
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:19,771
quantized hence the word quantum,
the prefix quanta in quantum physics.

1043
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:26,070
So if it was a continuum of matter and 
energy following the same laws of 

1044
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:33,120
physics,
then I would say then it's sole systems 

1045
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,601
all the way down,
but the rules completely change and so 

1046
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:42,421
things can on the surface seems similar,
but when it comes time to understand 

1047
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:47,491
them and to analyze them and to 
manipulate them and to exploit their 

1048
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:51,631
conduct and their behavior for other 
means as we have done with atoms or 

1049
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:55,081
molecules for the entire it revolution,
you no longer are they the same and you 

1050
00:49:56,741 --> 00:49:59,260
abandoned this romanticized concept.

1051
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:04,530
So now with the neurons,
the network of neurons and the cost are 

1052
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,450
the clusters of galaxies and galaxy 
superclusters.

1053
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,960
That would be on the right neurons on 
the left.

1054
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:12,520
That's so eerie.
yes.

1055
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,560
So,
so yeah,

1056
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,590
they can look the same,
but they are operating under completely 

1057
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,030
different laws of physics.
So in other words,

1058
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:27,031
the laws of physics that dictate what's 
going on in brain cells have no 

1059
00:50:27,031 --> 00:50:28,130
relationship to what's going on in the 
universe.

1060
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,170
Brain cells,
you're undergoing a.

1061
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:31,670
We can tell you what forces are 
operating.

1062
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:32,170
It's,
it's,

1063
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,660
it's electromagnetic forces.
Brain cells use electrical impulses,

1064
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:39,620
chemical impulses.
This is why drugs can affect the brain.

1065
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,170
All right?
There are chemical,

1066
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,820
the chemistry going on in the brain,
in its natural state.

1067
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,470
You disrupt that,
enhance it.

1068
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,270
You just,
you just put down some,

1069
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,300
some,
some chemistry and your stomach that's 

1070
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:52,300
now affecting your brain.

1071
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:52,300
Um,
what'd you just drink there?

1072
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,070
What was it?
Alpha brain algebra.

1073
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,930
Okay,
so you're entering the chemistry.

1074
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:03,040
So it's chemistry.
What's going on on the large scale 

1075
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,040
structure,
the universe is not chemistry.

1076
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,100
There's some chemistry deep within,
but it's,

1077
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,250
the chemistry is not what's making that 
pattern.

1078
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,930
And because of that it becomes an 
artistic curiosity,

1079
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,890
not something that has any kind of deep 
scientific insight.

1080
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,590
So it's just a fast.
It's disappointing similarity.

1081
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:19,850
Yes.
It's a fascinating.

1082
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,640
Similarly put them up together and it's 
fun to think about it,

1083
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:25,400
but it's not.
It's fun to think about it artistically,

1084
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,410
but not scientifically.
No,

1085
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,570
it's great if you're hanging out with 
your friends going,

1086
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:31,010
wow,
man,

1087
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,630
high,
you are.

1088
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,360
Yeah,
exactly.

1089
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:38,430
Yeah.
When you're looking at subatomic 

1090
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:38,430
particles,
excuse me,

1091
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:42,521
and you're looking at these,
like when they observed a particles in 

1092
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:45,821
superposition,
whether moving and stationary at the 

1093
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:46,010
same time,
and they blink in and out of existence,

1094
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,400
like when you get down to that,
and I repeat the,

1095
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,560
the,
uh,

1096
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:56,561
the opening page of the book,
the universe is under no obligation to 

1097
00:51:56,561 --> 00:51:56,561
make sense to,
oh yeah,

1098
00:51:56,561 --> 00:51:56,561
for sure.

1099
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,460
Definitely does.
Yeah.

1100
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:04,700
So at that scale,
things that go on with atoms and 

1101
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,510
molecules fall outside of your life 
experience.

1102
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,840
You don't hang out at the bar with 
protons,

1103
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:13,841
new claw,
nuclear weapons or other nuclear plans 

1104
00:52:13,841 --> 00:52:13,841
or,
or molecules.

1105
00:52:13,841 --> 00:52:18,161
You just don't.
So what they do in their day is 

1106
00:52:18,161 --> 00:52:21,551
completely foreign to you.
So now you shrink down to that size and 

1107
00:52:21,551 --> 00:52:22,460
particles a popping in and out of 
existence.

1108
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,450
The,
the,

1109
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,410
theY become conjoined quantum,
mechanically conjoined.

1110
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,990
And it's completely weird.
And you would say,

1111
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:34,991
This is,
none of this makes sense and this is 

1112
00:52:34,991 --> 00:52:35,420
observable in a visual sense.
Uh,

1113
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,190
well,
it depends.

1114
00:52:36,191 --> 00:52:41,191
Depends on how big the phenomena is.
Otherwise you can see other things that 

1115
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,111
would happen that you know,
that are the manifestations of that 

1116
00:52:44,111 --> 00:52:44,111
happening.
But yeah,

1117
00:52:44,111 --> 00:52:46,610
so an electron is smaller even than 
that.

1118
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,160
Oh yes.
By how many factors?

1119
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,440
No,
no,

1120
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:49,700
we don't.

1121
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,920
We don't know.
We don't know was no electric.

1122
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,660
Never measured the size of an 
electronic.

1123
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:58,690
The concept of super string theory,
so a supo these smaller than that,

1124
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:03,270
the strings would have to be smaller,
thinner.

1125
00:53:03,271 --> 00:53:08,271
It's smaller than the electronic self by
many that I couldn't quantify for you.

1126
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,190
I got to bring in a string theory 
person.

1127
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,870
So iT's like at the bottom of what we 
can observe.

1128
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,800
Well,
that's a great question.

1129
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:18,710
what is the bottom and the,
you know the word adam,

1130
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,430
which was introduced by the greeks.
You knoW,

1131
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,030
what adam means in greek?
It has a translation,

1132
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:23,810
you know what I mean?
No.

1133
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,580
Indivisible.
Ah,

1134
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:30,770
so they imagined that all matter was 
you'd come down to some thing that was 

1135
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,550
invisible,
figure that out.

1136
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,110
They figure it out.
They supposed it and they were the first

1137
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:37,600
day were,
you know,

1138
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,900
they're wealthy and had free time and 
you know,

1139
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:45,430
when they weren't waging war or that you
could think and what we think of his 

1140
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:50,481
philosophy was traceable to a lot of 
what they were doing back then and the 

1141
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:55,101
origins of what science is,
are traceable to back to back then that 

1142
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:59,451
you have an idea that applies to what 
the universe does that enables you to 

1143
00:53:59,451 --> 00:54:00,000
predict future behavior.

1144
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,400
That is science.
And so,

1145
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:07,700
uh,
so the atom it turned out is divisible 

1146
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,500
is divisible into sub atomic sub atom 
particles.

1147
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,730
So you get electrons,
protons,

1148
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:14,070
neutrons,
and a whole host of other particles less

1149
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:17,910
familiar there,
neutrinos and other things that it turns

1150
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:22,911
out protons and neutrons are further 
divisible that you get corks out of 

1151
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:23,970
those.
And as far as we know,

1152
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,260
there are only four fundamental 
particles in the universe.

1153
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,970
The photon,
which is light,

1154
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:34,450
the electron of which there are several 
species that the anti electronic,

1155
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,040
but just these are state simple here.
The photon,

1156
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,400
the electron,
the cork,

1157
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:45,950
and the neutrino.
Everything in the universe that we've 

1158
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,731
ever observed is made out of that stuff,
so those are the atoms of the universe,

1159
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,540
the indivisible parts,
if you will.

1160
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:59,570
Now,
this isn't by the way dark matter could 

1161
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,420
be made of yet another kind of saying 
that we don't know yet the blood.

1162
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,450
We got top people trying to figure out 
what dark matter is.

1163
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:05,160
We've measured it out there.
We just don't know what it is.

1164
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,200
Well,
it's something like 90 something percent

1165
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:09,630
of the universe,
dark matter and dark energy.

1166
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:15,020
It's 95 percent of all that drives the 
universe and we can measure the 

1167
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,340
existence of both.
Yet we have no idea what's driving them.

1168
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,520
This is an awesome opportunity for you 
to eliminate this.

1169
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,000
Often it's all in astrophysics for 
people in heart.

1170
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:27,090
It's all it comes out in may.
You can preorder it,

1171
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:32,091
which by the way,
publishers love it if you preorder it 

1172
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:32,500
and adorable,
but it's beautiful.

1173
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,230
It's a good size.
It's adorable.

1174
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:39,510
Preorder it on amazon.
You know the reason why they publishers 

1175
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:39,940
like you to preorder it is so that they 
can take of me.

1176
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:40,800
Yeah,
they just want to.

1177
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:43,640
Didn't want to overprint they don't want
to under print that,

1178
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,720
so they get a sense of the preordering 
because you're not charged until they 

1179
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,260
ship it,
so it's a pretty harmless exercise.

1180
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:53,100
While we're on this subject of subatomic
particles and weirdness,

1181
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:54,420
I wanted to.
I want to,

1182
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:59,421
if you could eliminate this often 
misused explanation for the observer 

1183
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:05,091
effect because you know the the 
particles waves and you watch them and 

1184
00:56:05,091 --> 00:56:07,410
observed them and it changes.
The reaction is heavily misunderstood.

1185
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:11,010
It's misunderstood because people want 
to attribute it to magic.

1186
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:16,011
The magic and the consciousness looking 
at it but isn't in fact just measuring 

1187
00:56:16,011 --> 00:56:16,290
it.
Yes.

1188
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:20,370
Thank you.
Please explain next question because I'm

1189
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:22,040
so tired.
Show show you.

1190
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,400
Good.
It just drives me nuts.

1191
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,310
Your people with you.
I try when I'm.

1192
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,870
Where are you pulling?
What?

1193
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,530
What?

1194
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,280
Where are you getting your people?
Well,

1195
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,600
I Don't own them for sure.
Definitely not my people.

1196
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:40,090
They vary greatly.
Kennedy been looped in together.

1197
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:45,140
I know you haven't admirably diverse 
following and then not many people can 

1198
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,230
claim that and it's probably because of 
your diverse profile.

1199
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,490
Right?
Well,

1200
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:53,491
I'm as open minded as I can be smart and
you'd read and you're thoughtful and 

1201
00:56:53,491 --> 00:56:57,510
you're also on some level of respect 
people here at somebody out and you're,

1202
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,220
you know,
you did,

1203
00:56:58,221 --> 00:57:00,420
you got your mma thing.
so no,

1204
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,130
you're in a lot of places and a lot of 
spaces and that's a good thing.

1205
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,950
I mean we need more unity in this world,
so.

1206
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:07,020
So.
Well,

1207
00:57:07,021 --> 00:57:08,020
thank you.
Thank you.

1208
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,150
Please explain what flipped people are 
getting wrong.

1209
00:57:11,151 --> 00:57:12,180
Okay.
So very simple.

1210
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:14,020
It's much simpler than you think.
Okay.

1211
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,620
Alright,
you ready?

1212
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,840
Yes.
So I'm looking at you.

1213
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:23,040
the only reason why I can see you is 
because there's light reflecting off of 

1214
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:26,170
your face,
your body into my eyes.

1215
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,390
So there's light.
Oh,

1216
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:29,150
by the way,
these stars.

1217
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:29,620
That's.
Yeah,

1218
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:31,160
those are hubble photographs.
Oh my god.

1219
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,480
Yeah.
Those are images from the hubble and I 

1220
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,600
walked in the sheets that you put over 
the a fluorescent light cover.

1221
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,420
And so when we look up,
we actually see the real,

1222
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,760
real images.
You're pretending it's the night sky.

1223
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,340
Yeah.
Well it be recording studio.

1224
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:52,180
What I want to do in the future studio,
I want to actually build a glass ceiling

1225
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,910
and have a full scale image,
a high resolution image of stars.

1226
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,680
So a planetarium.
You're describing a planetary.

1227
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:00,730
Exactly.
Call it that.

1228
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:01,750
It's a planetarium.
Well,

1229
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:03,970
something like that,
but I just wanted an image.

1230
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:07,100
You know what you know?
Tell me how to do It.

1231
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:07,570
I'll do it.
No,

1232
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,890
do better than that.
You get a,

1233
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:13,210
you get occurred version of those very 
high resolution led.

1234
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,370
Curved,
yeah.

1235
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,030
Okay.
Then you put any image up there you want

1236
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:20,710
and then the night sky tonight,
it's what the sky looks like from,

1237
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,600
from alpha insuree.
Oh.

1238
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:27,620
So lIke when you go to see one of those 
star shows at a planetarium and they 

1239
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:27,780
show it on the ceiling above you.
Well,

1240
00:58:27,781 --> 00:58:32,781
yes,
but nowadays that the ceiling itself is 

1241
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:32,781
the,
is the source of light.

1242
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:37,720
It's not projected from something.
So then you just feed that with image 

1243
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,710
data and then it becomes whatever you 
want.

1244
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,220
Can you hook me up with someone who 
knows how to do that?

1245
00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:40,840
Yeah,
I can totally.

1246
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,700
I'm excited.
You don't know people.

1247
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,630
I got people,
I mean people that my people,

1248
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,330
terry,
I mean my people because you're mobile,

1249
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:47,830
you are,
you.

1250
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:52,420
Are you happy that you know the people 
teach the people.

1251
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,000
so I guess so here what I'm looking at 
you.

1252
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:55,540
Okay.
All right.

1253
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,090
Yes.
And I see you.

1254
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:02,590
I want to know where you are.
So I turn on the lights and I say,

1255
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:03,760
there you are.
All right.

1256
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:08,590
Now let's make you tinier.
Let's make you mini me.

1257
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,120
Okay.
Like in the movie,

1258
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,550
right?
So that was a tiny version of you.

1259
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,550
A mini me version of joe rogan.
Now your little.

1260
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,050
I turn on the light.
You're still there.

1261
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:18,910
Okay.
Okay.

1262
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,740
Because if the lights are not on,
I can't see you.

1263
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:23,330
I don't know where you are.
Right?

1264
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,740
It's that simple.
Okay?

1265
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,800
Okay.
When you start becoming the size of 

1266
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:35,180
molecules right on down to the size of 
an atom.

1267
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:40,420
And I asked the question,
where is joe rogan the adam and I turn 

1268
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:46,580
on the light to see you there because I 
think you're there.

1269
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,160
The light,
the photon comes in,

1270
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:53,420
hits your adam and pops you into another
location.

1271
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,200
Hm.
The very act of trying to measure your 

1272
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,401
position prevents me from measuring your
position and as have jack shit to do 

1273
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:08,630
with your consciousness or your mind or 
your eyes or anything.

1274
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:12,170
It has to do with the fact that to know 
you're there,

1275
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,720
some information has to come from you to
me,

1276
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:18,740
like shining a light on you.
And the smaller you are,

1277
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:22,220
the more susceptible you are to the,
the,

1278
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,520
the energy of the light changing your 
position in space.

1279
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,220
So my question is,
how do you notice like you ever.

1280
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,520
This is still happen,
you're a quarter spills out of your 

1281
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,760
pants pocket on the back seat of a car 
and it's there in the wedge between the 

1282
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,960
bottom and the back seat.
And so you try to reach in to get it.

1283
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:47,890
And the act of reaching for the coin 
makes the coin move farther away from 

1284
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,710
you.
Uh,

1285
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,350
the act of reaching for it,
right?

1286
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,360
Because we separated,
you separated and it just slides down 

1287
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:55,940
even further.
That's not your mind making that happen.

1288
01:00:55,941 --> 01:01:00,941
It's the,
it's the act of the measurement that is 

1289
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:01,490
affecting what it is you're trying to 
measure.

1290
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:06,700
And this was discovered in quantum 
physics until the point where that's 

1291
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,731
actually,
it's the heisenberg uncertainty 

1292
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:11,171
principle.
It's one of the basic foundations of 

1293
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:11,620
quantum physics.
Now when it's round,

1294
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:16,720
it's profound,
but when it's described in the eu will 

1295
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,671
weigh you.
They show these particles going through 

1296
01:01:18,671 --> 01:01:21,920
these slots and then observing them 
changes the pattern that they go through

1297
01:01:21,921 --> 01:01:22,970
with.
And there's a.

1298
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:27,971
There's a horrible cartoon that you see 
in that a movie.

1299
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,520
What the bleep?
I couldn't get through that movie.

1300
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,190
I tried.
Did you go crazy with the bad science?

1301
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,630
No.
Can I tell you where I turned to?

1302
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,460
Maybe I should say,
well,

1303
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:40,280
here's what people don't know.
A lot of that is from a cult.

1304
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:44,110
The woman that I didn't know,
the woman who is the lunch,

1305
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,480
I don't mind a cult movie.
I don't know.

1306
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,800
She's a channeler.
She's speaking as a character like di di

1307
01:01:49,801 --> 01:01:50,690
know that.
That one.

1308
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:51,920
Oh,
blonde woman,

1309
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:52,960
older blonde woman.
That's.

1310
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:56,500
And she speaks when she speaks,
she speaking as a care.

1311
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,140
Okay.
I didn't know that.

1312
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,490
You have to like,
she's,

1313
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,940
she's a part of this very bizarre sort 
of cult.

1314
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,850
And should I tell you where I tuned it 
out or you want to finish this?

1315
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:06,970
Okay.
So I tried to,

1316
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,030
I just couldn't watch it.
Right.

1317
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,820
There's a point where they're talking 
about,

1318
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:11,750
uh,
uh,

1319
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:15,710
natives in the caribbean seeing european
ships.

1320
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,030
Yes.
And then they said,

1321
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,100
well,
because they'd never seen a ship before.

1322
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,900
They brain didn't register it as 
anything and then it just disappeared.

1323
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,250
Bullshit.
And I'm thinking,

1324
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,840
no,
that's not how the brain works.

1325
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,510
Excuse me.
That's not how this works.

1326
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,860
Okay.
What would happen?

1327
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,600
They might not know what they're looking
at,

1328
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,390
but they'll know they're looking at 
something and it had ships.

1329
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,670
They,
they went from island to island.

1330
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,200
That's how you get from island to 
island.

1331
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:40,800
They say,
Well,

1332
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:42,970
that's a really big version of what 
weird.

1333
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,610
We've never seen anything that big 
before.

1334
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,890
I don't know what it is.
I don't know where it came from,

1335
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,140
but I want to find out.
I want to study it.

1336
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,700
I'm going to protect myself,
whatever.

1337
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:55,850
So just because you've never seen it,
doesn't mean you're not going to 

1338
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:55,850
register it.
Excuse me.

1339
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:55,930
No,
no,

1340
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:56,760
no.
I said,

1341
01:02:56,761 --> 01:02:59,640
no wonder I can't waste my.
I got other things I've got to devote my

1342
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:01,980
brain energy to instead of instead of 
this,

1343
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:02,830
but someone else.

1344
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:04,170
Oh,
it gets better later on.

1345
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:05,360
So I said,
maybe I'll borrow.

1346
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,150
No,
it does.

1347
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,110
It gets more confusing later on and it,
it,

1348
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,830
it,
it does a better job of confusing you as

1349
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,580
to what science has shown and what they 
haven't shown now.

1350
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:19,060
By the way,
just in all fairness to what they.

1351
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,240
I think that the point they were trying 
to make,

1352
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,170
there are things that if you don't know 
to recognize them,

1353
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,080
you would.
They Would go undiscovered.

1354
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,040
Yes.
Okay.

1355
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,500
But that doesn't mean you wouldn't see 
them.

1356
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,420
Okay.
So for example,

1357
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:38,421
let's say you're walking and you didn't 
know that you were walking over this 

1358
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:43,410
huge burial mound because the slope was 
really shallow and you just walking,

1359
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:44,700
okay,
well you just,

1360
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:45,420
you,
you,

1361
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,610
you didn't notice that.
Okay?

1362
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,330
So you need a different way to see it in
order to know.

1363
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,270
So from space,
from an angle,

1364
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,780
measure the height,
whatever.

1365
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,650
So there are ways to miss things that 
and that.

1366
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:02,660
And that happens all the time,
but if it's something there on the 

1367
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,470
horizon,
my gosh,

1368
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:08,010
this is why we have eyes.
Okay,

1369
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,110
now they're not the best day to taking 
devices,

1370
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,060
but it was come time to tell you whether
there's a shipper,

1371
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:13,980
not a ship that you've never seen 
before.

1372
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,430
It's a ship.
Of course.

1373
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:21,110
Of course.
I'm just so much evidence of that when 

1374
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:21,110
people discover new animals.
Yes.

1375
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:21,780
I've never seen anything before 
anything,

1376
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,420
anything.
There's no record of it whatsoever.

1377
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:27,120
People find it and they could still see 
most scientific discoveries.

1378
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:28,860
You discovered something we've never 
seen before.

1379
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,990
Ramp the.
That was the woman's name.

1380
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:33,700
That was the,
the person that she was channel.

1381
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,050
That's a cool channeling name,
but you have to have a channeling name.

1382
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,460
It ramped our chancellor.
I'd be ramp though.

1383
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,030
I found that after the,
uh,

1384
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:43,560
after the movie was done,
after I watched it,

1385
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:45,920
I was,
they got me with a lot of things.

1386
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:46,440
I was like,
wow,

1387
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:47,310
is that true?
IS that real?

1388
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,340
Then I started reading.
Fortunately that movie came out in the 

1389
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:52,740
two thousands instead of in the 
nineties.

1390
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,960
Because if it came out in the nineties,
we were all got duped.

1391
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,840
Oh,
go and have the internet to research all

1392
01:04:57,841 --> 01:05:02,841
the shit that's wrong with it.
But in the two thousands I started 

1393
01:05:02,841 --> 01:05:02,841
researching it and then I would send it 
to my friends,

1394
01:05:02,841 --> 01:05:02,841
like,
look,

1395
01:05:02,841 --> 01:05:04,110
look,
look where the fuck this came from.

1396
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:05,490
And then.
And then you go,

1397
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:06,580
oh,
that's a called.

1398
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,240
Yeah,
it's a.

1399
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,370
The ladies at color,
she's like,

1400
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:11,400
she's talking like she's an alien.
She's supposed to be an alien.

1401
01:05:11,401 --> 01:05:13,860
Right?
Isn't that you see it in there anyway.

1402
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,730
Again,
I don't mind.

1403
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,760
I don't mind if people think their 
channel or is that just don't put them 

1404
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:19,760
in charge of anything.

1405
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:19,760
That's all.
Well,

1406
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,331
It's not that I signed.
It's just that you should probably say 

1407
01:05:24,331 --> 01:05:26,400
that when you get going with that.
Yeah.

1408
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:31,500
So I know exactly what I'm saying called
nobody's ever said she calls herself 

1409
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,620
ramp.
They think it's real and genuine and 

1410
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:35,620
sincere and they're very sincere because
they've put themselves.

1411
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:36,890
Well,
that whole thing we need is,

1412
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:37,820
is,
is you.

1413
01:05:37,821 --> 01:05:42,821
Don't you need is some foundation of 
science literacy so that you can 

1414
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:48,361
inoculate yourself against those who 
would exploit your absence of knowledge 

1415
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:51,730
of how the science works for their own 
gain?

1416
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,440
Well,
not even for their own gain.

1417
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:55,030
Just youtube videos.
I mean,

1418
01:05:55,031 --> 01:06:00,031
someone could make a very compelling 
youtube video where they get you 

1419
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:00,031
convinced at all.
My god,

1420
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:02,260
dinosaurs aren't real.
They start playing these things for you.

1421
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:03,040
they tell,
hey,

1422
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:06,810
tell us about phones can pop popcorn in 
the cmc.

1423
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:07,060
That one.

1424
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:08,090
Oh,
I have seen that way.

1425
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:13,091
Yeah.
You line up sometimes within the 

1426
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:14,810
department color you gotta like directly
to colonel someone that can't really 

1427
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:14,810
happen.
No,

1428
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:14,920
of course.
No,

1429
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:15,510
of course not.
Here.

1430
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,650
Imagine it could.
Jesus christ will be like,

1431
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:22,651
what are we doing with these phones?
But there's a ton of those out there 

1432
01:06:22,651 --> 01:06:23,770
where people see that's one of the 
problems with,

1433
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,770
uh,
with a lack of dialogue with someone who

1434
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:29,770
just has one narrative.
Like you sit down,

1435
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,250
he added something and you just talk.
ain't no,

1436
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,700
it's a,
it's very similar to like,

1437
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,760
even if you write a blog,
I mean it's one thing if you're writing 

1438
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,161
a blog,
like say if you're an expert in 

1439
01:06:41,161 --> 01:06:43,070
electronics,
you read a blog about how a televIsion 

1440
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,451
works,
but if you're just a person and you 

1441
01:06:45,451 --> 01:06:45,451
don't really understand what you're 
talking about,

1442
01:06:45,451 --> 01:06:49,711
but you're right something and use the 
right words and you say it in a very 

1443
01:06:49,711 --> 01:06:53,071
compelling way,
like an attack piece on someone that 

1444
01:06:53,071 --> 01:06:55,891
really has no basis in reality,
you can have someone convinced this 

1445
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:58,030
person's a terrible person just by 
writing something without them having to

1446
01:06:58,031 --> 01:06:58,360
respond.

1447
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,710
I call up stop,
never did that.

1448
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:04,711
I tweet a february,
I tweet a few weeks ago and I don't get 

1449
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:05,880
their budget because it's,
it's way better as the tweet than I will

1450
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:10,890
ever remember it as the tweet.
So it was one of the great challenges in

1451
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:15,730
life is knowing enough to think you're 
right,

1452
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,890
but not enough to know you're wrong.
Yeah,

1453
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,290
well that is a big problem with a lot of
people that watch his youtube videos.

1454
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,400
that's what it is.
They say,

1455
01:07:24,401 --> 01:07:25,180
oh,
this is right.

1456
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:30,181
Oh my gosh,
but they don't know enough to know why 

1457
01:07:30,181 --> 01:07:30,181
it's wrong,
but this is what I wanted to talk to you

1458
01:07:30,181 --> 01:07:30,181
about.
Uh,

1459
01:07:30,181 --> 01:07:31,390
what is it about people that there's 
this,

1460
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:32,160
this,
this,

1461
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:37,170
this very compelling need to find 
something out that other people don't 

1462
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:39,310
know.
Like the world is flat,

1463
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:44,460
like dinosaurs aren't real.
Like that kind of stuff is very 

1464
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,670
compelling to people.
So what I do in those cases,

1465
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:46,470
in the,
In the,

1466
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,420
uh,
yeah,

1467
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:52,610
so what I do is I would say instead of 
debating them and some of some of your 

1468
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:55,350
listeners are listening to this right 
now,

1469
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,360
it's what all I would do is say,
what is your best single bit of evidence

1470
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:08,220
for what you're claiming and what would 
it take to show that you're wrong?

1471
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,030
All right,
well let's go get a simple one.

1472
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:13,420
So,
so,

1473
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:15,110
so that's what I would ask.
And

1474
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,220
I've done

1475
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,250
this exercise and it doesn't work.
You know why?

1476
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:24,310
Why?
Because there was a guy who didn't 

1477
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:24,310
believe we went to the moon.
We spent a third of our time in our last

1478
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:24,750
session.
Goes there.

1479
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:29,920
So there's someone I know who doesn't 
believe he went to the moon rather than 

1480
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,830
just say he's skeptical.
So I said,

1481
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,960
what kind of evidence would convince 
you?

1482
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:38,810
He said images of the landing site of 
the apollo missions.

1483
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:40,100
So I said,
okay,

1484
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,740
here's a website where we sent a.
If it wasn't west,

1485
01:08:44,741 --> 01:08:47,450
it was the chinese think the chinese 
were europeans sent,

1486
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:50,330
aced a probe to an orbiter,
to the moon.

1487
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,810
So It was close enough because ground 
based telescopes are not,

1488
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,810
don't they don't have the resolution to 
see the landing sites,

1489
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:02,020
but if you get close enough to the moon 
you can get It photographed the entire 

1490
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:02,020
surface of the moon.

1491
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:06,490
And there were the landing sites and you
saw the rover tracks and the base for 

1492
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:09,490
the lunar module.
And so he,

1493
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,650
that night he went home and found it and
then he came back and says,

1494
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,230
well,
nasa could have faked that.

1495
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,120
Well,
I'm done with you.

1496
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:22,270
We have no more to talk about because 
he's not ready to be convinced.

1497
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:23,540
Well,
that's a weird.

1498
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:26,880
Because he gave him the evidence.
He asked for exact.

1499
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,930
That would convince him and it did not 
convince them that we have,

1500
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:36,960
I have no other conversation with.
That's a singular event which you could 

1501
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,561
say in one way or like it is possible 
that someone could fake a singular 

1502
01:09:41,561 --> 01:09:45,881
event.
They can't fake whether or not the 

1503
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:45,881
world's flat,
right.

1504
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:49,240
Like that to me is the scariest one,
that there's so many people out there 

1505
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,720
that believes the world is flat because 
you could,

1506
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,750
you could literally see the curvature of
the earth from a plane.

1507
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:59,020
I mean you can get to a parts of the,
you look at the images from the space 

1508
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,890
station where they circled the moon or 
they circled the earth rather.

1509
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,540
I mean there,
there's many,

1510
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:05,570
many satellite images of the earth in 
its entirety.

1511
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,400
You know,
and one of the thIngs that,

1512
01:10:07,401 --> 01:10:12,401
the argument was,
is how come every photograph of the 

1513
01:10:12,401 --> 01:10:13,040
earth is a compilation of photographs?
Well,

1514
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,380
because they're all taken from 300 miles
up.

1515
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:20,381
The earth is huge.
Here's a way bigger than 300 miles or 

1516
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:20,930
have to take a compliment,
do this.

1517
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,180
The only way to get.
Except for the apollo photo,

1518
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:28,270
the polish 17 coming back has the earth.
That's the famous one that was africa 

1519
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:30,310
and antarctica and view the full earth.
Very few.

1520
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,920
Full earth's is very hard to get a full 
earth single photo.

1521
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,590
Of course,
the astro and when we went to the moon,

1522
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,630
the moon missions,
when they're coming back,

1523
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,590
think about it.

1524
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:44,590
To get full.
Earth means the sun is behind the 

1525
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:49,181
astronauts on the way back to earth,
which means the side of the moon facing 

1526
01:10:49,181 --> 01:10:52,901
earth is not lit,
but that's the side of the moon they 

1527
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:56,291
came from,
so they want to visit the moon while 

1528
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:59,111
it's sunlight there,
they don't want you to need flashlights 

1529
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:01,840
when they get to the moon,
so they visited the moon while there's 

1530
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,150
sunlight earth.
The view of earth at that time will not 

1531
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:08,141
be full.
So apollo 17 was there long enough so 

1532
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:13,040
that by the time they left the moon was 
basically a new moon.

1533
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,360
Earth was full,
moon of earth was full earth,

1534
01:11:15,361 --> 01:11:18,360
and then he got a fuller throat up.
Those packs that they have on their back

1535
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:23,361
that regulate the temperature,
that allows them to walk on the surface 

1536
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:23,361
of the moon when it's 250 degrees above 
zero,

1537
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:23,970
the side is facing.

1538
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:26,190
The sun is more than 200 degrees and in 
the shadow,

1539
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,060
the 150 degrees and below.
Yeah,

1540
01:11:28,061 --> 01:11:29,280
yeah,
so ken,

1541
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:31,560
it switched back and forth between those
two environments.

1542
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:33,980
Know what you need,
know what you just insulate the.

1543
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,030
It's insulated and so when you're 
insulated,

1544
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:41,300
those temperature extremes are not felt 
the minimized and it's regulated by the 

1545
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:45,771
pack.
Pack those warm oxygen and no it 

1546
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:51,261
maintains the temperature,
but in the case of warming and cooling 

1547
01:11:51,261 --> 01:11:53,160
in the face of what's going on,
it maintains the temperature.

1548
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:54,690
That's how you need to thInk about it.
Okay,

1549
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:58,170
so regardless of what it is,
cooling one side of you and chilling the

1550
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,730
heating,
the other side,

1551
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:04,560
it's maintaining a temperature for you 
and when you are in space like say,

1552
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:09,561
well,
they're doing a space can click on the 

1553
01:12:09,561 --> 01:12:10,971
space station.
Same thing as being on the surface of 

1554
01:12:10,971 --> 01:12:10,971
the moon is real atmosphere on earth.

1555
01:12:10,971 --> 01:12:13,800
You are in this,
in this cocoon there I say,

1556
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,460
of atmosphere,
so all the air in this room is the same 

1557
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:24,111
temperature because the air can 
communicate a difference in temperature 

1558
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:28,590
to itself.
Equilibrating it across the whole room,

1559
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:33,740
right?
If you don't have air than your 

1560
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,380
temperature is measured by where's the 
energy coming from,

1561
01:12:34,381 --> 01:12:36,840
the teaching you,
and if the sun is hitting you,

1562
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:42,290
all that energy will be raising your 
temperature and the side of you that's 

1563
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:42,810
not facing photons.
That temperature will drop,

1564
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:45,900
so you need to.
You could survive it if you put yourself

1565
01:12:45,901 --> 01:12:49,200
on a rotisserie,
figuring out the right rotation rate,

1566
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:54,230
and even then you'd have to spend pretty
quick in order to actually calculate 

1567
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:54,230
that.
Yeah,

1568
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:55,230
you have to figure out what the right 
rate is.

1569
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,490
Now when you get in a debate with a guy 
like bob guy,

1570
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,420
I don't debate people.

1571
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,580
Okay,
well when you discussed the saying goes,

1572
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,590
when winning argument lasts more than 
five minutes,

1573
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,350
both sides are wrong.
Well,

1574
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:12,410
that's a terrible saying.
It was definitely something wrong and 

1575
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:12,750
the other person's stubborn.
It definitely lasts for hours.

1576
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:14,660
Yeah,
that's true.

1577
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,160
It's true.
Eighty percent of the time,

1578
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,560
but you got into would that wrapper that
thinks that the.

1579
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,860
Here's,
I'll tell you why bob,

1580
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:27,861
because in his twitter stream he was 
saying he was invoking physics and so I,

1581
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,870
I gotta I gotta deal with this and so he
showed a picture from bear mountain,

1582
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:38,871
which is a mountain in,
in slightly upstate New York where 

1583
01:13:38,871 --> 01:13:41,610
manhattan is in the sight line of the 
summit of this mountain.

1584
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:47,480
And he says,
give her the curvature of the earth and 

1585
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,851
this formula,
you should not be able to see manhattan 

1586
01:13:49,851 --> 01:13:49,851
at all.
Okay.

1587
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,190
Um,
and it depends on the height that you're

1588
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:53,610
viewing.
Well,

1589
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,180
thank you.
Well,

1590
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:54,900
well,
so,

1591
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:59,930
so you,
you do the math and it turns out 

1592
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:00,780
manhattan,
the island would not be visible at all.

1593
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:06,380
That's true.
But any building taller than 15 stories 

1594
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,070
would rise up above the curvature of the
earth.

1595
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:10,020
And you will see it.
And if you look at the photo,

1596
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,950
you see the tall buildings

1597
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:17,130
rising above 15 stories.
It's exactly what the correct formula 

1598
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:21,271
shows and not his formula,
which was wrong and misinterpreted a 

1599
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:22,690
claims to show.
Well,

1600
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:27,691
it's just bizarre because snipers had 
been using the literal curve of the 

1601
01:14:27,691 --> 01:14:31,560
earth to plan where bullets go.
That's how you want it.

1602
01:14:31,561 --> 01:14:34,450
That have to,
when you shoot a mile,

1603
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,630
you know when you're shooting like well 
out over a thousand yards.

1604
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:38,800
those,
those factors.

1605
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:44,040
So let me think of mile.
I have to ask how much curvature of the 

1606
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,800
earth you get after a mile drop 
question.

1607
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:47,890
You get dropped in curb to be gravity 
drop.

1608
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,940
Yes.
And then curve.

1609
01:14:48,941 --> 01:14:49,930
Yeah.
So both of those.

1610
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:50,800
Yeah.
Well,

1611
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:52,270
is it good?
It's here.

1612
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:57,410
Here's the thing to say someone,
if you have a bullet in your hand and 

1613
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:57,790
you shoot a gun,
uh,

1614
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,050
which drops faster,
right?

1615
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:05,530
They generally,
they get the wrong answer to that drop 

1616
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:05,530
at the exact same rate.

1617
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:06,190
Go hIt the ground at the same time,
exact same time.

1618
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:08,020
And that,
that blows people's minds.

1619
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:10,750
I can't believe that physics one-on-one.
Wow.

1620
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,960
It's,
it's a physics demo.

1621
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:16,600
So that's why physics is so important.
You know,

1622
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,700
people always take biology in this 
grade,

1623
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:23,940
but don't leave out the physics because 
that's where the fundamental operations 

1624
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:27,361
of nature are to be found.
Of the physical universe are to be 

1625
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:30,571
found,
so what you have is you have a gun at 

1626
01:15:30,571 --> 01:15:33,481
one side,
it's like a thing that shoots out a 

1627
01:15:33,481 --> 01:15:36,241
project to,
we'll call it a gun at one side of the 

1628
01:15:36,241 --> 01:15:38,611
stage,
and then you have like a little stuffed 

1629
01:15:38,611 --> 01:15:38,611
animal.
If the other side's case held up with an

1630
01:15:38,611 --> 01:15:42,580
electro magnet at the top of his head,
and these two are exactly the same level

1631
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,670
as the projectile comes out from the 
booth.

1632
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:50,671
There's many cannon it trips and 
electric circuit that releases the 

1633
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,630
electromagnet at the top of the stuffed 
animal.

1634
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:56,650
The stuffed animal begins to fall.
The bullets moves horizontally,

1635
01:15:56,651 --> 01:16:01,651
but also falls because gravity is 
pulling them both and you watched the 

1636
01:16:01,651 --> 01:16:06,421
projectIle curve down,
you watch the stuffed animal come down 

1637
01:16:06,421 --> 01:16:07,840
and it hits the stuffed animal every 
single time.

1638
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,800
The only factor that would change that 
would be if you put wings in the bullet.

1639
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,600
it was dealing with the wind.
When the wind would affect it.

1640
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,270
Did they have boats with wings?
I haven't seen that.

1641
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,570
No.
They don't know.

1642
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,460
But if they did,
you know,

1643
01:16:22,461 --> 01:16:26,350
if like you shot the bullet and then 
they figured out like wings came out.

1644
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:28,830
I saw that on some James Bond movie I 
thought.

1645
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,030
Yeah,
I'm sure.

1646
01:16:30,031 --> 01:16:30,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1647
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:36,100
It's,
it's just got to be frustrating for you 

1648
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,470
when these things come back around.
Like there was no flat earth theory when

1649
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:40,330
I was in high school.
So the other things though,

1650
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:41,890
think about it,
when you were in high school,

1651
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,460
there was much more astrology going on.
Oh yeah.

1652
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,580
The president,
reagan.

1653
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,610
Nancy reagan has an astrologer.
Uh,

1654
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:52,790
so today you don't see much of it.
You,

1655
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,330
unless you talked to steve maxwell,
what?

1656
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,320
But it's still there.
It's just not,

1657
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:00,580
it's not manifesting in public policy.
Some people believe in it deeply.

1658
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:03,160
I agree.
But it's not up there in public policy.

1659
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:04,030
That's what I'm saying.
Okay.

1660
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:09,160
Well we're the.
Nancy reagan was really the only one 

1661
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:09,770
that made it with public policy then.
But at the bar to you,

1662
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:10,020
do

1663
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,660
you hear people saying,
what's your sign?

1664
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:16,220
Is that still pick up 100 percent be 
true?

1665
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:16,790
Listen,
dude,

1666
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:19,850
you're married an american man.
I'm out of it.

1667
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:21,260
You don't understand if you want to get 
laid,

1668
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:23,810
you got to talk nonsense.
People got sucked.

1669
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,160
Well,
I'm a scorpio.

1670
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:28,220
If you're a taurus,
we should just stop.

1671
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,230
I'm sorry I missed that.
I misled myself.

1672
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:32,020
I thought it was fading.
Oh,

1673
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:36,140
nancy reagan was the big proponent of 
it's nonsense.

1674
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:41,141
Astrology.
Now it's not like someone who really 

1675
01:17:41,141 --> 01:17:42,440
understands astrological charts and can 
plot it and the moon's in retrograde and

1676
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:47,441
you were born and you know,
celsius is rising and all that crazy 

1677
01:17:47,441 --> 01:17:51,401
crap that they tried to.
I don'T know what they're doing on a 

1678
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:51,401
talk show with finished roger a real 
one.

1679
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:51,620
Apparently.
Yes.

1680
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:54,290
She.
She's real or fake one,

1681
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:59,291
right?
She says she's real and I trust her 

1682
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:03,560
because she talks about how fake other 
astrologers are a hater.

1683
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:09,650
I don't trust her.
And she was saying that the kennedys all

1684
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:14,180
died during a lunar eclipse.
Scary.

1685
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,360
And you know that this is a very 
checkable statement.

1686
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:19,460
She just says this and everyone's 
listening and believing in.

1687
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:19,910
Wow.
That's.

1688
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,340
That can't be by accident.
Well,

1689
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,840
I don't know when other kennedy's died,
but I know when Jack Kennedy died and it

1690
01:18:26,841 --> 01:18:29,600
was November 22nd,
1963,

1691
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:35,100
so.
So I don't need to know if there's an 

1692
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:35,100
eclipse then I just need to know what 
phase the moon is in.

1693
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:39,610
Right?
Because you can only have a lunar 

1694
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:39,610
eclipse when the moon is full.
So the moon was nowhere near full.

1695
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:43,040
It was like two weeks away from full.
Even if there was an eclipse,

1696
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:46,100
it didn't happen during an eclipse is my
point.

1697
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,820
Right.
Okay.

1698
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,520
So of course,
because it was daylight.

1699
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,910
Well,
well no,

1700
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,610
you can have a lunar eclipse at anytime.

1701
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:56,380
Okay.
You can have solar look anytime too.

1702
01:18:56,381 --> 01:19:00,410
It's just dark.
It's just how it would be for the world.

1703
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,860
Right,
right.

1704
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:05,630
Don't be so silly centric centric.
In fact,

1705
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:10,690
when there's a lunar eclipse,
anyone on this side of the earth that 

1706
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:10,690
sees the moon will see the lunar 
eclipse.

1707
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:12,350
So,
so by the way,

1708
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:15,920
lunar eclipses you get several per year 
by the way.

1709
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:21,190
A partial eclipses as a minimum and 
every couple years there's a full and 

1710
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:23,420
rich ellipses.
So these are not rare things to start.

1711
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:24,830
They're not rare.
Okay.

1712
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,420
So I said,
you know,

1713
01:19:26,421 --> 01:19:27,500
he,
he was shot when the,

1714
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:31,520
I forgot what muna was first quarter 
moon and she said,

1715
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:36,550
oh,
well this counts if they're anywhere 

1716
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:37,850
within two weeks on either side of the 
eclipse,

1717
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:40,790
that's a month.
That's a month out of 12.

1718
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,220
What?
I said,

1719
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,620
let me just shut up here and let her 
keep sharing the time.

1720
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,540
It was a thrill.
Had a talk shOw.

1721
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,390
We will talk to him.
So.

1722
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,730
And he likes science by the way.
And he,

1723
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:52,880
he wore the nasa shirt at the,
uh,

1724
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:57,140
at the,
at the academy award group photo.

1725
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,630
so I got to give him some props for 
that.

1726
01:19:59,631 --> 01:20:00,560
But.
So,

1727
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:01,920
but we're.
So I just said I'm,

1728
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:07,010
I'm have nothing more to say here.
Hence my argument with her lasted less 

1729
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,350
than five minutes now.
What are they when,

1730
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:12,390
when they're trying to decide like what 
your personality would be and what you,

1731
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:17,470
you know,
what you can dictate from your birth 

1732
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:18,900
date and what time you were born.
What are they exactly.

1733
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:23,901
Trying to connect.
So I had a deeper awareness of this 

1734
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,720
recently when I learned that people take
the names of things very seriously.

1735
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:38,690
Okay.
The names mean things to people 

1736
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:41,910
regardless of what the thing actually 
is.

1737
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:44,150
Okay.
Okay.

1738
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,380
Okay.
So What might we mean by this?

1739
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,660
Uh,
so uh,

1740
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:53,860
let's like astrophysics,
I say we have this thing called dark 

1741
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:53,860
matter.
We don't know what it is.

1742
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:54,750
Well,
it's got to be some kind of matter.

1743
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,850
No,
no.

1744
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:59,910
It shouldn't be called dark matter.
It should be called fred.

1745
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:02,040
All right.
With no,

1746
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:07,100
it shouldn't lead you to think anything 
about it because we do not know what it 

1747
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:12,951
is.
We shouldn't really call it dark 

1748
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:12,951
gravity.
It is,

1749
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:16,240
it is gravity that we have measured.
We don't know what's causing the 

1750
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:16,240
gravity.
Just call it dark.

1751
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,780
Matter implies you think it's matter.
Some people do,

1752
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:21,900
but we don't know.
So explain to me what,

1753
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,590
what is this based on?
Like When you say dark matter,

1754
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:30,591
what is it based on its.
I'd like to just call it fred for let's 

1755
01:21:30,591 --> 01:21:31,200
call it fred and I'm saying we don't 
know what it is,

1756
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:31,380
right?

1757
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,190
What Is,
how is,

1758
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,200
how is measuring the gravity of this 
stuff?

1759
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:37,230
Okay,
it's out there the six times the gravity

1760
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:41,010
of stuff that's ordinary matter.
we don't know where it's coming from.

1761
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:42,760
We don't know the source.
We don't know the arctic.

1762
01:21:42,761 --> 01:21:47,761
Is that a parallel universe?
Is that we don't know and how are we 

1763
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:48,810
measuring it by its effect on the 
motions of object.

1764
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:54,980
So a certain strength of gravity will 
force you to move at a given speed as 

1765
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:59,481
you near it.
And as you pull away and we see this in 

1766
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:00,420
galaxies,
galaxy clusters,

1767
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,610
binary galaxies and large entire 
galaxies that are made completely out of

1768
01:22:05,611 --> 01:22:10,611
this fred,
at least 80 percent of the force of 

1769
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:13,950
gravity manifested in these galaxies is 
fred.

1770
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,130
Yes.
And,

1771
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:19,380
and that's why.
Why are they calling it dark matter?

1772
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:20,400
They shouldn't,
in my opinion,

1773
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:22,980
she called dark gravity because that's 
literally what it is.

1774
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:25,590
So its gravity that cannot be measured,
a gravity,

1775
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,840
gravity and poorly understood.
It's not understood.

1776
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:28,420
Correct.
So it's,

1777
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,140
it's mysterious gravity completely 
measured to measure it.

1778
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:34,920
We can't narrow down what you measure 
against gravity.

1779
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:35,820
Precisely.
Right.

1780
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:36,810
Okay.
So you measure it,

1781
01:22:36,811 --> 01:22:38,880
but you can't.
So my origin,

1782
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:43,881
because some,
we don't know what it is that my point 

1783
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:44,580
is because someone called it dark 
matter.

1784
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:50,490
It has swayed everybody into thinking 
that it is matter of some kind.

1785
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:56,640
It has constrained people's thoughts 
about how to think about this problem.

1786
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:02,270
Okay.
So now the ancients looked up and they 

1787
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:05,661
saw these stars and they put their 
culture on the sky.

1788
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:10,390
So there centaurs,
there's,

1789
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,310
there's,
you know,

1790
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:14,930
um,
uh,

1791
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,680
when it was sent to archer.
So it sagittarius.

1792
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,180
We have a ryan,
the hunter.

1793
01:23:19,181 --> 01:23:21,520
We have tourists,
we have sea serpents,

1794
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:26,790
we have rivers,
we have stuff that mattered to people 

1795
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:26,790
back then.

1796
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,690
Okay,
we have an aquarius.

1797
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,570
What does it,
what's the water bearer?

1798
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:32,680
Oh,
the warner bear.

1799
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,310
That must mean that when the sun is in 
aquarius,

1800
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,670
it's going to rain more on earth.
Why?

1801
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:45,270
Because the ancients called it the water
bearer a okay.

1802
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:50,490
And all of a sudden the name reigns 
supreme over the fact that it is a 

1803
01:23:52,511 --> 01:23:57,511
random set of stars widely separated in 
space that don't even look like people 

1804
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:03,970
holding a pitcher of water of the 88 
constellations,

1805
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:08,971
about six of them look like what you're 
told they're supposed to look like the 

1806
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:13,201
rest require opium induced imagination 
to establish what they are.

1807
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:20,070
So they all have names.
Then you go to the astrologers tables 

1808
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,030
and they say,
oh,

1809
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:25,270
this is the rain sign,
or this is a dry drought sign.

1810
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:30,420
And then you take the names of things 
and those names are what they interpret 

1811
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:33,880
based on where the moon is.
The sun is where the planets are and all

1812
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:36,250
whatever the angle configurations they 
are.

1813
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:41,400
And each angle has a certain latitude 
over which they'll count it as a hit 

1814
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:46,470
rather than as a miss.
And so this gives extraordinary capacity

1815
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,830
of the astrologer to tell you what's 
going on in your life.

1816
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:53,480
Uh huh.

1817
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:58,640
So it's bullshit.
But they did have this real,

1818
01:25:01,441 --> 01:25:06,441
a fascinating connection with these 
certain constellations and all of the 

1819
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:10,190
different things that they thought were 
attached these certain constellation.

1820
01:25:10,191 --> 01:25:10,470
You know,
it's,

1821
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:11,040
you know,
it'd be like,

1822
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:16,041
it'd be like I'm a geologist going up to
the border of Colorado trying to 

1823
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,180
understand the shape as a geologist.
Hm.

1824
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,100
It's,
it's,

1825
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:25,250
it's an arbitrary shape.
Colorado was a square on a curved 

1826
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:29,511
surface.
It's amazing how much confirmation bias 

1827
01:25:29,511 --> 01:25:29,710
is attached bY a river by a.
Yeah,

1828
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:34,880
that's right.
So the wiki has a great website on 

1829
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:40,100
cognitive bias and there's like 20 or so
well known by every person.

1830
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,230
It should be.
This should be a course called cognitive

1831
01:25:46,231 --> 01:25:47,220
bias.
One-on-one,

1832
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:50,610
not forget college.
Every high school should have a course.

1833
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:55,611
Cognitive bias and the entire course 
should be about all the ways we fool 

1834
01:25:55,611 --> 01:25:56,580
ourselves.
don't you think?

1835
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,930
So,
I've tweeted this to science.

1836
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:07,370
The only of the scientific method is to 
make sure you are not fooled into 

1837
01:26:10,161 --> 01:26:12,680
thinking that something is true,
that is not,

1838
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:17,030
or thinking that something is not true.
That is,

1839
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:23,320
that is the only point of the.
And therefore the scientists could be 

1840
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,010
anything you invent.
Just take better notes,

1841
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:26,570
take a chart recorder,
uh,

1842
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:28,820
be more awake next time you take the 
data,

1843
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,880
bring a friend to observe it with you.
Whatever it takes to minimize the 

1844
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:38,330
chances that you will miss,
interpret what you're looking at so that

1845
01:26:38,331 --> 01:26:41,990
you don't think something is true that 
is not or thinks something is not true.

1846
01:26:41,991 --> 01:26:46,370
That is do whatever it takes to support 
that,

1847
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:50,210
that a mission statement.
That's what the scientific method is and

1848
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:55,211
that's what we do as scientists and 
that's why when you bring all of these 

1849
01:26:56,001 --> 01:27:01,001
things that people do,
so it's the astrology and the crystal 

1850
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:01,001
healers and the and who are the,
the,

1851
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:01,640
the,
the,

1852
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:06,700
the therapeutic touch people and you 
don't know that's real.

1853
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,880
You don't even understand.
This goes on healer.

1854
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:14,270
I'm an intuitive.
He goes on and on and on and on,

1855
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:17,360
and these are the things that fail in 
the double blind science.

1856
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:20,240
Any why do you do double blind?
So you don't fool yourself into thinking

1857
01:27:20,241 --> 01:27:25,241
something is true.
That's why you do double blind if you 

1858
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:28,691
don't and you want something to be true,
even if you even if you're surprised by 

1859
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:29,990
something that might've been true that 
you were against,

1860
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:35,290
still you need someone else to check it 
out and you only get an emergent 

1861
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:40,171
scientific truth when you have agreement
among different people's experiments is 

1862
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:42,080
there so even if you get a result that 
you're happy with,

1863
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:47,590
it is not yet a scientific truth until 
you can confirm it by other people who 

1864
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:50,810
have no investment in you who don't care
about.

1865
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:52,430
In fact,
we're trying to show that you're wrong.

1866
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:58,180
This is what made einstein so great 
because no one believed as relativity 

1867
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:01,661
and they kept devising evermore accurate
experiments to show he was wrong and it 

1868
01:28:01,661 --> 01:28:03,530
ended up showing that he was right by 
ever higher precision.

1869
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:10,120
Do you think that we're doing ourselves 
a disservice by not teaching people how 

1870
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:14,621
the mind works,
how confirmation bias and and it's you 

1871
01:28:14,621 --> 01:28:16,410
shouldn't teach things in school.
I'm working on this one a few years,

1872
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:21,750
in a few years,
I'm going to have something by now 

1873
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:21,750
because I'm busy.
My kids are in school right now.

1874
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:22,820
Excuse me.
I can't.

1875
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,760
I can't.
I understand,

1876
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:30,890
but let's discuss it because I think it 
curriculum has to include an entire 

1877
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:32,780
course on cognitive bias.
Yes.

1878
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:37,810
If we are going to emerge as adults,
no longer susceptible to charlatans.

1879
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:39,850
Yes.
Okay.

1880
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:45,250
Who are either well meaning and just 
misguided or who are explicitly 

1881
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:49,370
exploiting your ignorance and and it's a
major factor in our culture,

1882
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:54,371
a major factor when it comes to 
politicians dry factor when it comes to 

1883
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:56,210
bosses,
it's a major factor when it comes to how

1884
01:28:56,211 --> 01:29:01,211
you choose what you do for a living,
human interaction and human interaction 

1885
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:01,211
with nature itself.

1886
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:06,010
I mean we are constantly trying to 
manipulate and control other people's 

1887
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,140
biases,
behaviors the way they think,

1888
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:09,540
the way they act.
And we're very vulnerable in some senses

1889
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:12,570
because this is not something that's 
taught to us at an early age,

1890
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:14,610
you know,
and I think that were,

1891
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:17,310
it takes a long time to figure it out on
your own.

1892
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:19,560
And I've often thought like,
man,

1893
01:29:19,561 --> 01:29:21,960
why wasn't I explained this when I was 
young?

1894
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:27,040
Yeah.
Because the curriculum was dee dee 

1895
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,880
wasn't thinking about that.
When we're thinking about just giving 

1896
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,701
people facts instead of teaching them 
how to use this vessel into which you 

1897
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:36,591
pour information and nowhere and at no 
time are we trained how to turn effect 

1898
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:44,960
into knowledge,
knowledge into wisdom and wisdom into 

1899
01:29:46,531 --> 01:29:51,531
insight.
I think that full Sequence needs to be 

1900
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,060
in there,
in the academic system,

1901
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,760
k through 12,
13 through 16,

1902
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:57,820
13 point of view.

1903
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:00,060
A college has got to be in there 
somewhere.

1904
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:03,030
Without it,
you're just this vessel effects.

1905
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:08,090
Even if,
and even the people we call smart in 

1906
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:12,111
class,
these are people who get a's on 

1907
01:30:12,111 --> 01:30:12,180
everything and they know everything,
but do they have the deepest insight?

1908
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:17,540
Are they,
do they really understand what it is 

1909
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:20,130
that they're putting back on the test?
I don't think all of them do.

1910
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:22,170
I think they have good short term 
memory.

1911
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,380
Some of them and they do well on the 
exams because of that fact.

1912
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:28,610
So they're good at acquiring data and 
maintaining it,

1913
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:32,460
acquiring information,
and then bringing it back on command.

1914
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:37,910
Uh,
not all summer are deep thinkers and I 

1915
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:40,760
don't want to take that away from them.
All I'm saying is that the curriculum I 

1916
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,430
think needs these other dimensions of,
of survival really.

1917
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,400
So that's what it is.
It's survival in a world.

1918
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:50,970
And when a scientist says this is true,
you can ask,

1919
01:30:50,971 --> 01:30:52,650
well,
why do you think that's true?

1920
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,950
Exercise some healthy skepticism.
I don't have a problem with that.

1921
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:59,220
Say because of look at this evidence.
Do you know how to read evidenced by the

1922
01:30:59,221 --> 01:31:00,560
way?
And look at this evidence,

1923
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,940
look at this chart,
look at this experiment,

1924
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:07,941
and this is why we conclude 
overwhelmingly that this is going to 

1925
01:31:07,941 --> 01:31:08,340
happen in our future.
Uh,

1926
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,680
I choose out of your pointy headed 
scientists.

1927
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:11,640
What are,
you know,

1928
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:16,700
by the way,
give me my cell phone so I can call my 

1929
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,910
grandmother while I use gps satellites 
to know when to make a left turn,

1930
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:21,690
right?
I'm going to call my astrologist to tell

1931
01:31:21,691 --> 01:31:23,850
them these scientists don't know.
They got their head up their ass.

1932
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:27,420
So,
so yeah.

1933
01:31:27,870 --> 01:31:32,870
Well,
I think also it'd be really beneficial 

1934
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:32,870
to teach people how to manage 
perspective.

1935
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:37,790
And how to look at,
look at life in a way that's gonna be 

1936
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:39,740
beneficial to you,
but we're not really give them the tools

1937
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:42,000
to match the mind,
like philosophy,

1938
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:47,120
a philosophy class,
but even philosophy not all flustered 

1939
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,060
because where the philosophy of law,
you know,

1940
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:54,080
just how to think about decision making 
and the causes and effects and 

1941
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,470
consequences.
Uh,

1942
01:31:55,510 --> 01:32:00,510
there's not enough of that either.
Maybe they're relying on that to happen 

1943
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:00,520
at home,
but not all homes are intact.

1944
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:06,360
In fact,
perhaps most are broken homes or 

1945
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,251
separated homes.
And so I think the school system school 

1946
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:13,891
needs to be rethought.
And I'm trying to think that through a 

1947
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:13,891
few more years.
Well,

1948
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:15,240
anytime you talk about alternative 
schooling,

1949
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:18,250
people look at you like you're some sort
of a hippie freak who wants your kids to

1950
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:21,390
eat granola in the mountains and get 
their own spring water.

1951
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:26,590
You know what I mean?
That's what they think of when you say 

1952
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:26,590
alternative schooling.
Right,

1953
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:26,590
right.
I'll train them at home,

1954
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:28,030
man.
You good luck.

1955
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:29,860
As soon as you say homeschooling.
Oh,

1956
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:30,940
you're a religious nut.
I mean,

1957
01:32:30,941 --> 01:32:32,630
that's,
that's immediate perception.

1958
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:35,230
Fastest growing sector of the homeschool
and center.

1959
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:38,160
They don't want to cloud your head with 
all that evolution talk.

1960
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:38,650
Right?
Right,

1961
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:41,410
right.
Do you ever talk to that ken ham guy?

1962
01:32:41,411 --> 01:32:42,660
Have you ever sat down with that guy?
No,

1963
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:44,390
but bill nye has.
I mean booman.

1964
01:32:44,391 --> 01:32:47,020
I debated him.
I mean I can't debate people.

1965
01:32:47,021 --> 01:32:48,490
It's not what I do.
You just can't do it.

1966
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:50,590
I just can't do it.
It's not what I do.

1967
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:54,520
I'm an educator and I want to educate 
you so you can think for yourself,

1968
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,010
but then I go away.
That's it.

1969
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:02,220
To debate someone implies that whoever,
whoever is most convincing is correct 

1970
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:05,080
and that's not how knowledge works.

1971
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:10,500
So much charisma involved.
Whatever charisma level I have or not 

1972
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,740
have,
I don't want to hinge.

1973
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:14,350
What is true on that fact?
Right?

1974
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:15,850
Alright,
so I'm an educator.

1975
01:33:15,851 --> 01:33:20,851
I will.
I will teach you the causes and effects 

1976
01:33:20,851 --> 01:33:24,750
of what science,
knowing what science is and how and why 

1977
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:27,630
it works,
which is why it's critical that you 

1978
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:27,630
continue to criticize science fiction 
movies.

1979
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:28,690
It's very important.
Don't you back off now?

1980
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:34,290
We need you.
There's a lot of people that wouldn't 

1981
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:35,791
know that that chinese space station is 
nowhere near the space station and that 

1982
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:36,890
to her hair would be moving all over the
place.

1983
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:39,790
There would be everywhere,
but my favorite one is you remember when

1984
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:44,910
he's at the end of the tether and she's 
drawn to save him but she doesn't ever 

1985
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:48,970
have oxygen to do it,
so he lets go of the tether and that way

1986
01:33:48,971 --> 01:33:53,860
she can't save him before she can save 
herself and and then he flies away.

1987
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:55,090
It's like,
no,

1988
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:00,230
they're like floating in space.
He lets go of the tether.

1989
01:34:00,231 --> 01:34:05,231
It just stays there in his hand.
He would be right there and it would be 

1990
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:05,231
right there.
Nothing.

1991
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:05,740
He let's go.
Nothing happened.

1992
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,270
Wouldn't be like a bungee cord.
Now if he,

1993
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:09,780
if she was swinging him in circles and 
he like,

1994
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:14,790
oh yeah,
he fly off at a tangent but that's not 

1995
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:14,790
what was happening.
And nor were they rotating.

1996
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:17,440
I would check the what they were 
relative to earth below.

1997
01:34:17,441 --> 01:34:20,330
That waS not what was going on.
So then you don't.

1998
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:23,470
She could just give it a slight tug and 
then he would have drifted towards her.

1999
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:24,910
That could have even been a little 
romantic,

2000
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:29,970
a little baby tub would do it and they 
would slowly drift towards one of the 

2001
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:31,510
helmets would hit,
you know,

2002
01:34:31,511 --> 01:34:32,950
and then they went me mad.
Oh.

2003
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:36,580
And then the helmets would break and 
then there'd be freezing it instantly.

2004
01:34:36,581 --> 01:34:39,220
Right.
When you just suffocate that too.

2005
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:40,270
And then freeze to death.
Right.

2006
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,960
What movie nailed that?
That was one movie when space and they 

2007
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:45,960
overdid it a.
Well.

2008
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:50,611
There was a.
People want you to like explode in 

2009
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:50,611
space.
No,

2010
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:51,070
no.
I mean,

2011
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:51,500
well,
you,

2012
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:53,230
they want you to freeze solid to 
instantly,

2013
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:54,500
right?
No,

2014
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:55,220
no,
there's.

2015
01:34:55,310 --> 01:35:00,310
And even in,
was it armageddon where the sun rose 

2016
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:00,710
over the,
over the,

2017
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:03,830
over the comment,
and he didn't have his visor down and he

2018
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:08,831
was blinded by the side.
It's like the same son in our daytime 

2019
01:35:08,831 --> 01:35:13,421
sky.
The atmosphere doesn't protect you in 

2020
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:13,421
any way.
The earth's atmosphere takes out,

2021
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:14,540
you know,
a few percent.

2022
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,710
That's right.
Oh yeah.

2023
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,240
A few percent of all in the middle 
stage.

2024
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:21,560
One daylight at the top of the sky to a 
few percent.

2025
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:24,290
Now he'll get more uv.
He'll get more uv.

2026
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:26,150
That's important.
Get a little brown.

2027
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,700
yeah.
But um,

2028
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:30,050
yeah.
Uh,

2029
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:35,590
death in space is nowhere near as 
spectacular as movies would have you 

2030
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:35,590
think?
Yeah,

2031
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:37,220
they make it seem like if you take that 
helmet off,

2032
01:35:37,221 --> 01:35:38,830
you just have immediately freeze up.
Yeah,

2033
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:39,170
yeah.
no,

2034
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:41,120
no.
I mean You can go into very.

2035
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:46,390
What happens is there's nothing making 
you cold other than you radiating heat 

2036
01:35:47,361 --> 01:35:48,490
from your skin.
Oh.

2037
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:52,400
So you only get as cold as quickly as 
you can radiate away heat.

2038
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:54,830
That's all.
So we take quite a while.

2039
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,950
You just have no air.
So you'd suffocate quicker.

2040
01:35:58,030 --> 01:35:58,970
You'd suffocate.
Oh yeah.

2041
01:35:58,971 --> 01:36:00,980
You said okay.
Long before you saw anything,

2042
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:02,690
uh,
anything like that happen.

2043
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,120
So,
so just think about it.

2044
01:36:04,121 --> 01:36:07,070
There's nothing touching you that's 
making you cold.

2045
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,280
It has to wait for you to radiate away.

2046
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,440
That's what's happening.
Okay.

2047
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:15,830
And so that,
so yeah,

2048
01:36:15,831 --> 01:36:20,831
you will feel very cold very quickly,
but you're not going to die from that 

2049
01:36:20,831 --> 01:36:21,020
fast.
Now when stephen hawking,

2050
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:26,021
and by the way you also have dissolved 
gases in your body which will try to 

2051
01:36:26,021 --> 01:36:29,650
come in in the vacuum of space,
you don't have the air pressure tamping 

2052
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:32,600
down the dissolved gases,
so you take away the air pressure,

2053
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:37,900
then the dissolved gases will begin to 
bubble out of your blood and it's the 

2054
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,320
same problem with when you have the 
benz.

2055
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:44,400
Oh,
when you come up from low altitude and 

2056
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,961
you go to lesser pressure around your 
employees and so you want to do that 

2057
01:36:46,961 --> 01:36:49,620
slowly so that it's a very slow thing,
but the hazards of.

2058
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:53,780
But why would you be button naked in 
space?

2059
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:54,890
I mean,
you going to have a space suit on,

2060
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:56,960
so I just want to prove to everybody 
that you could do it.

2061
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:57,980
So I like.
Well,

2062
01:36:57,981 --> 01:37:00,980
they did it in 2001 a space odyssey.
They basically did it right.

2063
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:03,260
The guy without his helmet went through 
the airlock,

2064
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,600
just held his breath.
Oh,

2065
01:37:05,601 --> 01:37:06,230
okay.
Yeah.

2066
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:09,110
That's all he did.
That's way more reasonable.

2067
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:10,910
Well,
because it was a reasonable movie.

2068
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,900
That was a good movie that had real 
advisor stanley kubrick.

2069
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:19,930
Well,
he was a really interesting guy because 

2070
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:19,930
he was a mathematician,
stanley kubrick about it,

2071
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:21,230
but I knew he cared about that level of 
detail.

2072
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,120
He used to do complex math and it's for 
fun.

2073
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,320
So there's a,
there's a,

2074
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:29,380
there's a fail bit of physics and 
[inaudible] one day I'll talk about my 

2075
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:31,760
gut.
So the model,

2076
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:34,970
which was middle,
so remember when he's,

2077
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:40,220
uh,
he's on one of the moon crafts and he's 

2078
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:40,220
orbIting the moon and they give him 
food,

2079
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,530
right?
and there's a tray of nasty food.

2080
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:44,660
Obviously it's like astronaut food.
remember,

2081
01:37:44,661 --> 01:37:47,290
this is 1968.
So everything here is a,

2082
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:50,080
is a visual,
uh,

2083
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:52,310
uh,
the taste of the future.

2084
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:57,580
So he has another packet where he 
extends straw from that plastic packet.

2085
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,250
Okay.
Oh,

2086
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:00,210
there he is.
ExcelleNt.

2087
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:01,860
You get in the good photo.
you're good.

2088
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:03,090
You boys good?
Right here.

2089
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,040
Okay.
Yeah,

2090
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:06,120
there is.
So he sucks up the straw.

2091
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:07,890
Right?
And this is in zero g,

2092
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:09,600
so stuff is floating.
When he suck up the straw,

2093
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:13,470
then he goes to another straw and the 
liquid and the straw goes back down.

2094
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:15,730
That's gravity.
Oh,

2095
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:18,270
they fucked up.
Uh,

2096
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,360
he totaLly fucking.
No,

2097
01:38:21,410 --> 01:38:22,500
no.
So that one,

2098
01:38:22,501 --> 01:38:27,501
obviously he can't get everything right,
but it's fun to notice the things he 

2099
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:27,501
couldn't get.
Right.

2100
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:30,150
We didn't think to get right.
So to me it's a celebration.

2101
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,280
Here's another one.
Okay.

2102
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,780
The rotation rate of the space station.

2103
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:40,100
I calculated that and I calculated what 
g force would you have on the outer 

2104
01:38:42,301 --> 01:38:47,301
perimeter of the space station in 2011.
And I did the math and I forgot the 

2105
01:38:47,301 --> 01:38:52,221
exact number.
Something like between two and three 

2106
01:38:52,221 --> 01:38:52,221
g's.
Oh.

2107
01:38:52,221 --> 01:38:52,950
And I said,
why would you do that?

2108
01:38:52,951 --> 01:38:54,240
That's stupid.
You wouldn't do that.

2109
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,170
And I realized if they've rotated it at 
the rate that we give you one,

2110
01:38:58,171 --> 01:39:03,171
gee,
it'd be way too slow to make an 

2111
01:39:03,171 --> 01:39:04,280
interesting scene.
So I gave it to him.

2112
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:07,590
So I'll give you three gs because the 
strauss waltz,

2113
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:12,650
as the thing turns and the space shuttle
that's approaching it matches its 

2114
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:16,320
rotation rate with the opening in the 
center of the space station.

2115
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:21,000
This whole bow lay this entire ballet.
Wow,

2116
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:21,660
that's cool.
Again,

2117
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:24,810
happens at a stately,
but real pace.

2118
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:27,840
Okay.
But that pace gives him a three g,

2119
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:29,460
three g's of gravity.

2120
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:33,360
So it's three x the correct pace.
The correct pace may have been two and a

2121
01:39:33,361 --> 01:39:34,470
half,
but I forgot the number,

2122
01:39:34,471 --> 01:39:36,720
but it's,
it's multiples to high.

2123
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,390
So good.
And so I let him do it.

2124
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,850
It's so I'm not going to.
I'm that.

2125
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,010
That's artistic license.
That's mark twain.

2126
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:46,590
Ian licensed where he saYs first get 
your facts straight,

2127
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:51,480
then distort them at your leisure.
That is what I'm holding artists too.

2128
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:55,920
So now when you're looking at a space 
station,

2129
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,440
like they're in zero gravity when 
they're in the space station.

2130
01:39:58,441 --> 01:40:03,441
No,
they are in one g on the edge of the 

2131
01:40:03,441 --> 01:40:03,441
space station.
On the edge.

2132
01:40:03,441 --> 01:40:04,170
On the turning edge.
Yeah,

2133
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:05,490
that's what I mean.
That thing.

2134
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:09,050
So I mean the issue thing.
Oh our space station.

2135
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:10,180
Oh,
oh,

2136
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:15,620
zero g now it's.
but it is possible zero g because it is 

2137
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,530
in free,
fall towards earth.

2138
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:22,760
So it's constantly in free fall,
but it's just going around the freefall 

2139
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,930
earth.
But it's going sideways so fast that the

2140
01:40:24,931 --> 01:40:28,940
amount that it has fallen equals 
precisely the spinner.

2141
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:32,730
The curvature of the earth,
is that more proof of the earth is round

2142
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:36,450
if you've had physics one o,
n yes,

2143
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:41,190
but is it possible that the gravity and 
the space station,

2144
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:43,350
the only if you rotate it wrote tests,
not gravity.

2145
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:45,930
It's a simple,
but according to einstein,

2146
01:40:45,931 --> 01:40:48,240
they're indistinguishable from one 
another so you can do it.

2147
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:53,300
So there it is possible to do something 
where you can send people into deep 

2148
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:53,980
space and generate

2149
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,050
gravity through some sort of rotation of
two,

2150
01:40:56,051 --> 01:41:01,051
at least two ways.
One of them you just rotate it and all 

2151
01:41:01,051 --> 01:41:02,440
the good scifi movies have rotating 
sections of a space station.

2152
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:07,830
Right?
And some they have rotating opposite 

2153
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:08,230
ways so that they can spin up against 
one another.

2154
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:10,030
Right.
And uh,

2155
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:15,260
so there's some clever ideas out there 
with space stations of the future for 

2156
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:19,831
long voyages.
Were you bad commander hadfield on the 

2157
01:41:19,831 --> 01:41:22,531
podcast came back from space and was 
talking about the excruciating 

2158
01:41:22,991 --> 01:41:27,991
difficulty he had readjusting to gravity
after being in a zero gravity 

2159
01:41:27,991 --> 01:41:32,521
environment for so long.
he just showing off because he'd like 

2160
01:41:32,521 --> 01:41:33,230
setting records for was.
It wasn't until like six months ago.

2161
01:41:33,231 --> 01:41:34,120
It was a long time.
he was.

2162
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:34,550
Well,
he's showing.

2163
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:35,050
Yeah,
I couldn't,

2164
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:37,970
I couldn't handle life with you locally.
Earth people.

2165
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:44,100
He was talking about his body like it 
took like over a year before his bone 

2166
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:44,100
density came back.

2167
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,780
And this is partly addressed in the 
film.

2168
01:41:46,781 --> 01:41:47,580
The,
uh,

2169
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:52,360
the,
the martian kid who's born on mars comes

2170
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:53,740
to earth.
Which ones?

2171
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,350
One on mars?
Yeah,

2172
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:58,060
the kid born on mars.
Got to research this.

2173
01:41:58,061 --> 01:42:01,540
like now that was the name of the movie.
It's recent.

2174
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:01,920
Yeah.
Yeah,

2175
01:42:01,921 --> 01:42:02,410
yeah.
Oh,

2176
01:42:02,411 --> 01:42:04,750
that's the space between us now.
What the hell is that?

2177
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:06,400
You got to get out more,
dude.

2178
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:07,490
I do.
Yeah.

2179
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:09,370
That's so,
so this is a martian colony.

2180
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:11,440
The.
We're the first community.

2181
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,530
Who's,
what movie is this?

2182
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,860
This came out a couple months ago.
Really?

2183
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,060
Oh my gosh.
Oh yeah.

2184
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:18,070
Oh man.
I'm not on itunes.

2185
01:42:18,071 --> 01:42:19,270
You.
So that's the martian colony.

2186
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:24,780
And one of the female astronauts,
they send that one there happens to be 

2187
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:29,320
or they learn is pregnant and they can't
bring her back.

2188
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:33,430
And so she gives birth on mars to the 
first person who,

2189
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:35,680
uh,
was ever born on mars,

2190
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:41,940
and then they,
then they keep it a secret and then he 

2191
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:41,940
comes back as a teenager that falls in 
love.

2192
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:42,670
See?
There's the fetus.

2193
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:45,610
So.
So anyhow,

2194
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:50,640
he has a hard time on earth because his 
heart developed in martian gravity,

2195
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:53,310
which is only 38 percent earth gravity.
Oh wow.

2196
01:42:53,311 --> 01:42:55,540
Man on earth.
He just couldn't do that to,

2197
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:57,520
you know,
figure out what to do with them.

2198
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:58,920
Wow.
Yeah.

2199
01:42:58,921 --> 01:43:00,610
That's on mars.
The kid was born on mars.

2200
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,800
Okay.
Yeah.

2201
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,280
Don't spoil.
Alert me jamming.

2202
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:04,650
That's why.
Yeah,

2203
01:43:04,651 --> 01:43:04,980
yeah,
yeah.

2204
01:43:04,981 --> 01:43:06,550
Yeah.
So,

2205
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:07,820
uh,
what were,

2206
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,750
we were generating gravity.
One way to rotate it up.

2207
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:12,400
Another way is if you're headed 
somewhere,

2208
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:17,750
I just have a huge fuel tank and just 
always run your rockets.

2209
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:21,300
Oh,
there's always a g force.

2210
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:26,410
So if you sell or accelerate it,
one g right towards a destination,

2211
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:30,940
then you will always have gravity and 
you'll get there awesomely fast.

2212
01:43:31,090 --> 01:43:34,200
But you'd have to have so much fuel or 
rely on something.

2213
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:36,710
You filling stations en route,
this sort of thing end.

2214
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:38,160
If you do this,
you,

2215
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,460
you accelerate one g halfway there,
then you turn the space ship around,

2216
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:47,880
then you decelerate at one g for the 
other half of the trip so that when you 

2217
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,700
get there,
you're not whizzing past it in a by that

2218
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:53,060
we have one g the whole trip.
That's how you would do that.

2219
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:58,630
Wow.
So the momentum when you had precisely 

2220
01:43:58,630 --> 01:43:59,390
halfway there at one g.
Oh my gosh.

2221
01:43:59,391 --> 01:44:01,940
You hit near the speed of light very 
quickly.

2222
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:03,170
Whoa.
Oh my god.

2223
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,340
I forgot.
What is it in a.

2224
01:44:04,770 --> 01:44:06,230
I have to calculate it,
but it's,

2225
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:09,920
it's the acceleration of earth's 
gravity.

2226
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:13,100
If you actually move that fast,
that's,

2227
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,260
that's head snapping.
Now,

2228
01:44:15,261 --> 01:44:20,261
would they have to have some sort of a 
crazy propulsion system in order to do 

2229
01:44:20,261 --> 01:44:21,650
something along those lines?
How fast we're one g get you there?

2230
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:23,900
Yeah.
So,

2231
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:25,790
uh,
yes.

2232
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:30,790
So wow.
When she would take a one year plus the 

2233
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:35,021
distance in light years approximates and
tory four point two light years for 

2234
01:44:35,021 --> 01:44:35,360
example,
would take five point two years.

2235
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,340
So the distance in light years plus a 
year.

2236
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:39,570
So that's,
that's,

2237
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:43,070
that's.
So that gets you basically a 20,

2238
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:48,190
25 percent the speed of light.
What happens if you just run into stuff 

2239
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:48,190
on the way like there's a lot of stuff 
out there,

2240
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:48,310
right?
Yeah.

2241
01:44:48,311 --> 01:44:51,950
So he's not a giant issue in getting to 
mars is actually quite empty.

2242
01:44:51,951 --> 01:44:54,590
But if you do hit something that's the 
end of everything.

2243
01:44:54,591 --> 01:44:58,880
So it's a low risk,
high consequence thing.

2244
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:03,170
But you gotta you gotta put in play.
Now how much of a risk is the space junk

2245
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:08,171
that we've left in the environments?
We were started freaking out the other 

2246
01:45:08,171 --> 01:45:08,171
day about how many are up there.
He got.

2247
01:45:08,171 --> 01:45:12,911
So there's countless thousands of bits 
of space junk from chips or paint that 

2248
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:18,490
fell off of just some bolts and nails 
and retro rocket boosters.

2249
01:45:18,490 --> 01:45:19,310
Yeah,
it's all,

2250
01:45:19,311 --> 01:45:20,180
it's all up there.
And um,

2251
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:25,240
and I'm wondering whether we haven't 
been visited by aliens yet because they 

2252
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:25,240
saw the space junk orbiting earth and 
said,

2253
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:29,090
forget that I'm going to visit some 
other planet and risk my life.

2254
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:32,450
So short sighted approach to space 
travel,

2255
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:38,170
the nasa orbital debris office website,
you can actually see the debris that 

2256
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,970
nasa is tracking basic almost in real 
time.

2257
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:46,260
It's crazY.
They'll show it to you and it's like a 

2258
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,140
beehive around the earth.
So you got.

2259
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:48,740
Yeah,
there it is.

2260
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:50,990
Okay.
That's the debris around the earth.

2261
01:45:51,230 --> 01:45:52,000
That astra,
astra,

2262
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:57,250
that nasa tracks and that's failed 
japanese experiment to try to that outer

2263
01:45:57,621 --> 01:45:59,660
ring that you see,
that's the,

2264
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:03,140
the altitude of geosynchronous 
satellites and that,

2265
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:06,710
that should be.
There should be a video of that,

2266
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:08,250
uh,
despite.

2267
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:09,200
Yeah,
go to the bottom right,

2268
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,010
go to bottom,
right,

2269
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:10,580
right there.

2270
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,110
Click on that.
Play that video.

2271
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,530
Not a video.
Why isn't that a video?

2272
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:20,620
I'm sure there is a video somewhere.
There's a video on that site so you can 

2273
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:25,130
just see the movement of these pieces 
and it's launch windows.

2274
01:46:25,131 --> 01:46:27,660
Have to know when to not hit stuff.
So,

2275
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:29,690
so when you have lunch with,
it's not just,

2276
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:31,220
is everything aligned,
right?

2277
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:34,070
Is what we'll use successfully get past 
the,

2278
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,210
the debris.
And there was a japanese,

2279
01:46:37,211 --> 01:46:40,280
um,
they had an experiment to try to capture

2280
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:45,281
it with nets.
It was a recent motion yet I so didn't 

2281
01:46:45,281 --> 01:46:49,331
work out.
So the problem is the low orbit stuff 

2282
01:46:49,621 --> 01:46:50,280
will eventually

2283
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:53,340
fall in and burned up.
The high earth orbit stuff will never go

2284
01:46:53,341 --> 01:46:55,840
away.
There's nothing to destroy it.

2285
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:58,200
And so they can't capture that stuff.
Well,

2286
01:46:58,201 --> 01:47:01,140
you need a very clever.
the of this stuff is moving 18,000

2287
01:47:01,141 --> 01:47:04,200
miles an hour.
So what's your net?

2288
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:07,470
Just what are you doing?
That's so crazy.

2289
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:08,350
Oh yeah.
Here you go.

2290
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:11,290
The video go higher.
Rez on that.

2291
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:14,270
Sure.
I know there's a higher risk.

2292
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,760
God,
that's 10 80.

2293
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:23,370
No,
it's not from nasa as youtube parents 

2294
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:23,370
from somebody else.
But that's the kind of.

2295
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:27,710
So all of that.
That's debris that you're looking at 

2296
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:27,710
there.
So anyway.

2297
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:30,741
Yeah.
So you're concerned for debris as well 

2298
01:47:30,741 --> 01:47:32,391
placed and we may,
we may be putting so much debris in 

2299
01:47:32,391 --> 01:47:35,991
space that we will close ourselves off 
from space travel because of the dangers

2300
01:47:36,901 --> 01:47:39,600
it would take to get through our own 
garbage heap.

2301
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:48,600
that's so crazy.
And this was all started in the 19 

2302
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:48,780
forties,
19 fifties.

2303
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:50,610
When did they start shooting stuff up 
there?

2304
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:52,000
Oh no.
NineTeen fifties.

2305
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:53,410
Sputnik.
Yeah.

2306
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,350
Nineteen 57.
That was the first satellite,

2307
01:47:55,351 --> 01:47:56,250
right?
First anything.

2308
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:57,300
Yeah.
Anything in orbit.

2309
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,470
God and in that short amount of time.
Yeah.

2310
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:03,210
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2311
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:05,400
It's like,
it's like a dumpster.

2312
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:08,630
Sixty years.
Planetary don't ruin the whole thing.

2313
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:11,370
They had it for billions of years.
Sixty years.

2314
01:48:11,371 --> 01:48:13,090
They filled it up with junk.
Yup.

2315
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,470
oh my god.
That's terrifying.

2316
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,000
Yeah.
That's going around the earth.

2317
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:21,210
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

2318
01:48:21,211 --> 01:48:23,790
And has anybody ever hit anything while 
trying to do something?

2319
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:24,870
Uh,
well.

2320
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,730
So,
uh,

2321
01:48:26,731 --> 01:48:29,460
what exacerbates it is,
remember when China,

2322
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,660
when was this?
Nineteen or 2004.

2323
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:38,720
Two hundred and three.
China destroyed one of its own 

2324
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,290
satellites.
Orbit.

2325
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:41,950
I remember some of them.
Yeah.

2326
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:47,060
Yeah.
And they basically did a Connecticut 

2327
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:47,060
kill on a satellite.

2328
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,510
So Connecticut bill for those don't 
know,

2329
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:53,511
is you don't need explosives if the 
speed of the projectile and its kinetic 

2330
01:48:53,671 --> 01:48:57,600
energy is higher than the energy that 
would be in the explosive shell itself.

2331
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:02,520
Oh.
So fascInating.

2332
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:05,760
A calculation to make so,
so here it is,

2333
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:10,940
so I have this delivery system with a 
warhead and I put some balm device in 

2334
01:49:11,761 --> 01:49:13,920
the warhead and you can calculate how 
much energy that is.

2335
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:16,380
Then I send it and it hits and it blow 
something up.

2336
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,890
But suppose I send this thing really,
really fast.

2337
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:21,150
Really,
really,

2338
01:49:21,151 --> 01:49:26,151
really fast.
I can calculate how much kinetic energy 

2339
01:49:26,151 --> 01:49:29,100
this thing has the will be a point where
I give it so much kinetic energy.

2340
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:34,310
The kinetic energy is greater than the 
chemical energy of the conventional 

2341
01:49:34,531 --> 01:49:39,030
explosive that I put in the warhead.
A shoemaker levy.

2342
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:39,690
Well,
well,

2343
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:42,870
for example,
I gave you a terrestrial example.

2344
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:44,760
Um,
it's.

2345
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:46,680
So it's what we call a high speed 
collision.

2346
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,500
This is more than you bargained for in 
this,

2347
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:51,090
in our time together,
but I will tell you now.

2348
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:51,730
Okay.
You ready?

2349
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:56,940
Perfect.
The argument for the longest time that 

2350
01:49:56,940 --> 01:50:01,051
the craters on the moon work calderas 
from volcanoes and not asteroid impacts.

2351
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:08,680
The geologists argue strenuously.
These can't be asteroid impacts.

2352
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:12,490
They've got to be calderas these 
thousand craters on the moon.

2353
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:13,570
Who?
Why?

2354
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:16,750
Because everyone is a perfect circle.

2355
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:23,640
And if asteroids are coming from space,
they would come from all angles and if 

2356
01:50:24,101 --> 01:50:29,101
you come in at a shallow angle,
you get an oval and even shallower it'd 

2357
01:50:29,101 --> 01:50:33,521
be more oval.
So you'd have a whole range of circles 

2358
01:50:33,521 --> 01:50:34,030
and ovals and ellipses.
And if you don't see that,

2359
01:50:34,031 --> 01:50:38,140
they must be calderas law was not 
caldera,

2360
01:50:38,330 --> 01:50:41,170
volcanic volcanic crater,
volcanic crater.

2361
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,480
That's all.
Yeah,

2362
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:42,990
yeah,
yeah.

2363
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,010
It's a volcanic crater.
That's all.

2364
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:50,630
Um,
and it's just a little more poetic at 

2365
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:50,630
caldera,
but it's a,

2366
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:52,960
it's a crater left by a volcano that has
exploded,

2367
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:58,140
like the boom was so big,
the mountains gone and now it's just a 

2368
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:58,450
big hole.
Or at the top of the mountain,

2369
01:50:58,451 --> 01:50:59,590
there's a crater at the top of the 
mountain,

2370
01:50:59,591 --> 01:51:01,290
like crater lake,
that's a,

2371
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:03,610
that's a round hole in the top of a 
mountain.

2372
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,160
Um,
was that once a volcano?

2373
01:51:06,161 --> 01:51:07,060
I don't know,
but it's a whole.

2374
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:12,180
Okay.
So in the 19 seventies we were able to 

2375
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:15,080
do calculations with high speed 
computers with good computers.

2376
01:51:15,081 --> 01:51:20,081
and what we found was if the object is 
moving faster,

2377
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:28,180
if the kinetic energy of the object is 
higher than the energy that's holding 

2378
01:51:30,111 --> 01:51:31,370
the thing together,

2379
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,760
oh,
okay.

2380
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:40,370
So what's holding together a rock,
the chemical connections of the silicon 

2381
01:51:40,441 --> 01:51:42,770
and the oxygen and I,
everything that they ironed,

2382
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:45,120
all everything that's making the rock is
holding it together.

2383
01:51:45,121 --> 01:51:47,850
You can calculate how much energy is 
holding it together,

2384
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,790
and if it's going 45,000
miles,

2385
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:51,420
right?
That write down that number.

2386
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:56,900
Now I send in the asteroid with a 
kinetic energy higher than the energy 

2387
01:51:57,881 --> 01:52:02,881
that's holding it together on impact.
It explodes because all that energy goes

2388
01:52:05,741 --> 01:52:09,150
back into the rock because the thing is 
in moving anymore.

2389
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:12,130
We did the Connecticut treat energy go.
It digs a crater,

2390
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:17,160
number one,
by virtue of putting all that energy 

2391
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:20,230
back into the stone and that explodes 
it.

2392
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:22,480
So on impact,
even at an angle,

2393
01:52:22,481 --> 01:52:27,481
it is a singular point explosion.
And that's why every single crater is a 

2394
01:52:27,481 --> 01:52:29,980
perfect circle.
we call that a high speed impact,

2395
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:35,490
where the speed is greater,
the energy of the speed is greater than 

2396
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:36,590
the energy that's holding it together.
That's amazing.

2397
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:39,220
Now you have experience in this.

2398
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:40,230
Okay?

2399
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:43,260
Have you ever thrown a do this next?
Oh,

2400
01:52:43,261 --> 01:52:44,690
you were in California.
Sorry.

2401
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,190
Snowballs.
Snowballs.

2402
01:52:46,191 --> 01:52:47,360
Take us know.
Put a big bear.

2403
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:49,870
They have taken,
snowball it face.

2404
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:53,750
What's a barn wall?
And throw the snowball at it and it'll.

2405
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:58,810
It'll make a little circular mark on it.
Now change your angle to the wall and 

2406
01:52:59,811 --> 01:53:04,811
throw the snowball again.
It'll still make a small round mark and 

2407
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:05,480
it'll keep doing it.
You know why?

2408
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,600
Because the speed with which you through
the snowball,

2409
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:12,380
that energy is greater than the energy 
that's holding the snowball together.

2410
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:17,770
Because hardly energy.
Hardly any energy is holding the 

2411
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:19,550
snowball together.
It's just loosely packed snow.

2412
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:25,510
So when you do it against the wall,
you see the snowball completely 

2413
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:27,650
disappear in a,
in a mini snowball explosion,

2414
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:28,970
if you will.
ah,

2415
01:53:28,971 --> 01:53:33,971
so this works for any comparison,
a projectile speed and what we call the 

2416
01:53:35,331 --> 01:53:36,080
binding energy.

2417
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:41,100
The object itself.
This is why the intercontinental 

2418
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:43,931
ballistic missiles never carried 
conventional warheads because their 

2419
01:53:44,001 --> 01:53:48,710
speed coming out of this of space 
because they leave the atmosphere,

2420
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:51,560
go from one continent to the other,
and then they fall out of the sky.

2421
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:56,800
That speed gives them more kiNetic 
energy than any conventional warheads 

2422
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:57,070
would've had.
Whoa,

2423
01:53:57,290 --> 01:53:59,870
but then we figured out how to make 
small nuclear warheads.

2424
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:03,260
the nukes.
Now you're talking energy.

2425
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,880
The kinetic energy of the icbm is not 
higher than the nuclear warhead that we 

2426
01:54:10,131 --> 01:54:12,560
now put,
and that's why all icbm or nukes,

2427
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:17,860
wow.
the v two rocket basically didn't need 

2428
01:54:17,901 --> 01:54:22,901
an explosive warhead in its tip,
became out of the sky going five miles 

2429
01:54:22,901 --> 01:54:27,851
per second.
There was none of this that that 

2430
01:54:27,851 --> 01:54:28,460
implies.
You're hearing the thing,

2431
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:32,990
dude is coming and supersonically.
You're sitting there at a cocktail table

2432
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:36,080
on a block and then the block has gone,
is obliterated in the next incident.

2433
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,910
You didn't even know.
You didn't even know to look up.

2434
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:42,530
Wow.
So that's the add an explosive anyway,

2435
01:54:42,531 --> 01:54:44,810
but they.
They probably didn't need to.

2436
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:49,900
Now go back to a shoemaker levy.
That was a comment that slammed into 

2437
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:53,201
jupiter and jupiter is a gas giant.
I've always been confused as to what 

2438
01:54:53,201 --> 01:54:53,201
that means.
Oh,

2439
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:55,760
most of its mass is in the form of gas.
Most of it's.

2440
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:57,220
Oh yeah.
Ninety something percent of.

2441
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:02,480
So when shoemaker levy slammed into 
jupiter and going so fast,

2442
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:04,910
the gaseous atmosphere was like hitting 
a brick wall.

2443
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:07,820
Whoa.
That's how fast it was moving.

2444
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:13,850
So that's why the explosion was exactly.
So it's slow.

2445
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:18,940
All of its kinetic energy that it had 
got put back into the object itself 

2446
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:25,270
because it's slow down very quickly 
relative to its speed relative to the a.

2447
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:27,650
So.
So here's this comment,

2448
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:29,600
I forgot how big shoemaker levy was.

2449
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,910
So now it goes into the atmosphere and 
you say,

2450
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,290
oh,
isn't that just clouds?

2451
01:55:33,291 --> 01:55:36,790
And it can watch how fast it's going.
You can,

2452
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:42,250
you can ask the question over how much 
distance will it plow through its own 

2453
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:46,730
mass worth of gas?
That's it.

2454
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:47,670
That's the question,
right?

2455
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:53,380
That's,
that has to plow that much mass out of 

2456
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:53,380
the way.
That's an important resistive force,

2457
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:56,560
right?
So how much atmosphere?

2458
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:01,600
Well,
it's a lot of atmosphere because it's 

2459
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:01,600
gas and this thing is solid.
However,

2460
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:02,570
the thing is going,
what?

2461
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:04,440
15,
20 miles per second.

2462
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:08,580
It's falling into jupiter at $20.
Whatever the speed was.

2463
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,720
If you go at 20 miles per second,
you will cover that much atmosphere in a

2464
01:56:12,721 --> 01:56:16,710
fraction of a second,
so at a fraction of a second you go from

2465
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:20,940
20 miles per second to zero or to a tiny
fraction of that speed.

2466
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,970
All that energy has to go somewhere.
It goes back into the system.

2467
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:27,960
It's a comment made of ice.
Ice is not held together very easily.

2468
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:33,080
The whole thing explodes on impact.
That was another terrifying statistic 

2469
01:56:33,391 --> 01:56:37,170
that I read about the impact that hit 
the yucatan and killed the dinosaurs.

2470
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:41,550
That how deep it had gone into the 
earth's surface within the first second.

2471
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:42,390
Oh,
oh yeah.

2472
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:44,610
These are.
These are numbers that are staggering.

2473
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:47,490
Once you calculate what they are,
and likE I said,

2474
01:56:47,491 --> 01:56:50,040
if you come in fast enough,
earth's atmosphere is a brick.

2475
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,820
Might as well be a brick wall to you,
and by the way,

2476
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:56,610
you go 60 miles an hour down the road,
rolled down the window.

2477
01:56:56,611 --> 01:57:01,611
Just stick your hand out the window.
You have to use muscle energy to not 

2478
01:57:01,651 --> 01:57:06,651
have your and your hand blown backwards 
against 60 miles and hour of air against

2479
01:57:08,221 --> 01:57:10,710
your open palm.
Just try that next time.

2480
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:15,300
See what kind of energy that requires.
and that's 60 miles an hour.

2481
01:57:16,050 --> 01:57:19,890
Now imagine five miles per second.
10 moles per second.

2482
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:21,960
Twenty miles per second.

2483
01:57:25,110 --> 01:57:30,110
You're toast.
How deep did the asteroid that hit and 

2484
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:31,240
killed the dinosaurs?
How deep did that thing going over?

2485
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:36,280
so what was that?
That was a 150 mile diameter crater or 

2486
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:36,330
something like that.
I forgot the exact numbers.

2487
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:38,040
Uh,
so there's,

2488
01:57:38,041 --> 01:57:39,600
uh,
there's a relationship between the depth

2489
01:57:39,601 --> 01:57:41,520
of a crater and the diameter and the 
mass.

2490
01:57:41,521 --> 01:57:43,200
So the thing.
so no,

2491
01:57:43,201 --> 01:57:44,490
it goes miles down.
I mean,

2492
01:57:44,491 --> 01:57:46,190
it's,
it's miles.

2493
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:47,580
Oh yeah.
oh yeah.

2494
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:48,900
Well,
let me think.

2495
01:57:48,990 --> 01:57:51,480
An earth rang for like a million years.
What happens is,

2496
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:53,190
let me pull,
take that back.

2497
01:57:53,191 --> 01:57:55,830
I don't know if it's miles.
It's,

2498
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:59,430
um,
I think it was what I had read.

2499
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:01,180
I don't remember the exact statistic.
Well,

2500
01:58:01,290 --> 01:58:01,770
excuse me.
no,

2501
01:58:01,771 --> 01:58:06,771
no,
it's gotta go miles that because the 

2502
01:58:06,771 --> 01:58:06,771
thing is miles is the,
the,

2503
01:58:06,771 --> 01:58:08,850
the asteroid itself was the size of 
mount everest.

2504
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:11,220
So the extra associates like five miles 
across.

2505
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,260
So it's,
it's deep.

2506
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,340
No,
you just don't mess with this.

2507
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:19,430
By the way.
The crater in Arizona called meteor 

2508
01:58:19,430 --> 01:58:22,461
crater for obvious reasons that can sink
a 60 story building and it's not even a 

2509
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:28,370
mile across.
And now we're talking about a crater 

2510
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:28,370
more than a hundred miles across that 
took out the dinosaurs,

2511
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:29,470
that famous one in Arizona,
Arizona,

2512
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:31,310
a 60 story building.
You,

2513
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:36,470
if you,
if you put dirt up to the rim of the 

2514
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:36,470
crater,
you can bury a 60 story building.

2515
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:40,980
Had an instance where you,
this is your whole calculation about 

2516
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:43,210
explosions and about the amount of that 
they were looking for,

2517
01:58:43,211 --> 01:58:47,020
the raw materials that caused that 
crater.

2518
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:48,760
Correct.
Dot that they could mine it,

2519
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:53,790
correct.
They first thought is volcanic and the 

2520
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:53,790
geologists thought it was volcanic 
again.

2521
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:57,660
And the but one geologist in particular,
um,

2522
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:01,930
eugene shoemaker who was in line to be 
on one of the lunar missions and then he

2523
01:59:01,931 --> 01:59:05,110
had like a heart murmur and then they 
sent a check,

2524
01:59:05,111 --> 01:59:10,111
schmidt to in his stead who's also 
geologists turned us senator from

2525
01:59:12,410 --> 01:59:14,420
Arizona.
Where was he senator from?

2526
01:59:14,421 --> 01:59:15,500
I forgot.
Uh,

2527
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:16,180
but,
uh,

2528
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:19,010
can you look at a Jack Schmidt where he 
was senator from.

2529
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:21,710
Forgive me for forgetting [inaudible].
I knew I'm friends with him,

2530
01:59:21,711 --> 01:59:22,600
so I should known that.
Nasa,

2531
01:59:23,330 --> 01:59:24,320
jack schmitt,
s,

2532
01:59:24,321 --> 01:59:25,760
c,
h,

2533
01:59:25,761 --> 01:59:26,240
m,
I t,

2534
01:59:26,241 --> 01:59:28,130
t is not,
there's no dna.

2535
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,630
Uh,
so,

2536
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:30,820
uh,
but tesco.

2537
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:31,620
yeah.
So it's right.

2538
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:33,620
So in New Mexico I said Arizona,
New Mexico.

2539
01:59:33,830 --> 01:59:35,890
So he,
um,

2540
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:37,520
uh,
but anyhow,

2541
01:59:37,550 --> 01:59:38,120
he say,
no,

2542
01:59:38,121 --> 01:59:39,980
this is,
this is an impact crater.

2543
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:41,870
And well,
if it's an impact crater,

2544
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:44,250
where is the media?
Right?

2545
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:47,060
It must be buried down here.
And so there were miners.

2546
01:59:47,450 --> 01:59:52,450
They were there were there iron miners 
who bought the land so they can get this

2547
01:59:53,211 --> 01:59:58,211
huge media that they were sure which is 
sitting down there that they could mind 

2548
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:01,390
for its natural resource.
They could not find the meteor.

2549
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:06,760
Uh,
that's because it hit at high speed 

2550
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:07,190
velocity.
It was a high velocity impact,

2551
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:12,430
which means it's collision energy was 
greater than the binding energy even of 

2552
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:15,521
the iron atoms itself.
And 90 percent of that thing vaporized 

2553
02:00:16,521 --> 02:00:18,560
on impact.
Wow.

2554
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:26,030
Wow.
No iron.

2555
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:28,190
More impressive even than I remember.
Okay.

2556
02:00:28,191 --> 02:00:29,900
The pieces.
That's nice.

2557
02:00:29,901 --> 02:00:32,450
Low angle shot.
So you get the shadows of the rim.

2558
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,120
And that's an Arizona.
We're in Arizona near winslow,

2559
02:00:35,121 --> 02:00:36,950
Arizona.
Where would that be near?

2560
02:00:36,951 --> 02:00:39,200
Is that like if someone wanted to fly in
to see that?

2561
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:41,420
Oh,
here it is.

2562
02:00:41,421 --> 02:00:46,421
If you go to the grand canyon then you 
drive to this and it's a couple of 

2563
02:00:46,421 --> 02:00:46,490
hours,
two hours.

2564
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:47,320
Okay.
There's me.

2565
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:50,750
Your map was coming up.
And where's the grand canyon?

2566
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:52,790
There's meteor crater

2567
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:56,690
and grand canyon because it,
which is also an Arizona.

2568
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:00,370
Kenny has to park.
You can drive that.

2569
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:03,820
See that grand canyon to credit through 
flagstaff.

2570
02:01:03,821 --> 02:01:05,830
Yeah.
So you're not going to fly that.

2571
02:01:05,831 --> 02:01:10,050
You'd just drive it and yelp reviews to 
look at that highlighted.

2572
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:15,110
It's got five star reviews.
Why does it have all the stars?

2573
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:20,340
Look,
I know it should have every goddamn 

2574
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:22,380
star,
every three point nine people are so 

2575
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:22,380
picky.
It's not that big a deal.

2576
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,490
I could dig a little bit better myself.
Oh,

2577
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:27,340
by the way,
so this whole was this,

2578
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:30,150
this meteor crater was doug and like,
you know,

2579
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:35,960
a few seconds this crater was made and 
how many years ago was that?

2580
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:38,350
Fifty thousand years ago.
that's not proximately nothing.

2581
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:40,280
So there's probably

2582
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,980
some form of humaN living here then.
oh yeah,

2583
02:01:42,981 --> 02:01:43,760
yeah.
Early humans.

2584
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:46,790
I don't know if they were in north 
America.

2585
02:01:46,791 --> 02:01:48,080
Yeah,
I say $40,000.

2586
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:53,081
The most recent.
Right when they crossed the bering 

2587
02:01:53,081 --> 02:01:55,871
strait,
that's when they would adjust a ryan 

2588
02:01:55,871 --> 02:01:55,871
knutson.
Oh,

2589
02:01:55,871 --> 02:01:59,180
that's cool.
I'm going back to that multiple times.

2590
02:01:59,181 --> 02:02:00,710
oh yeah.
Is it freaky?

2591
02:02:01,610 --> 02:02:06,610
Freaky about it is you walk up to it,
you can't see it because the rim of the 

2592
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:10,361
crater,
it just looks like a ridge original 

2593
02:02:10,361 --> 02:02:10,361
line.
Uh,

2594
02:02:10,361 --> 02:02:12,590
the rim is raised above the plane of the
area,

2595
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:14,930
right?
Because when you press down it raises it

2596
02:02:14,931 --> 02:02:19,931
up a bit.
So you just walk up to it and then you 

2597
02:02:19,931 --> 02:02:22,391
come up to the ledge and then you 
realize what it is,

2598
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:26,390
is nearly a mile diameter hole in the 
ground.

2599
02:02:27,190 --> 02:02:28,550
Oh yeah.
It's a stunning,

2600
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:34,510
stunning encounter with the forces of 
nature and the fact that there's so many

2601
02:02:34,761 --> 02:02:37,190
of those particles just floating around 
out there.

2602
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:41,120
that's.
How big was that when you think?

2603
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:43,100
Oh yeah,
that was a bow.

2604
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:46,420
Uh,
um,

2605
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:50,660
uh,
about 20 yards across something.

2606
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:52,940
That's nothing.
That's nothing.

2607
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:54,840
That's nothing.
Twenty yards.

2608
02:02:54,841 --> 02:02:57,170
Yeah.
It may be between 20 and 40 yards.

2609
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:02,200
Twenty yards is the size of.
That's right from that garage to that 

2610
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:02,200
front door.
No.

2611
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,550
Make that kind of circle yards.
Yeah.

2612
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:06,860
Yeah.
Wow.

2613
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:08,990
That's crazy.
Right.

2614
02:03:09,310 --> 02:03:14,310
That's not the end.
That's the kind of thing they can get 

2615
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:14,310
close enough that you don't even see and
then it's too late.

2616
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:20,640
That's not gonna make us extinct.
but it will make a very bad day for a 

2617
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:20,640
city.
Yeah.

2618
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:20,640
Okay.
Well,

2619
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:25,330
yeah.
City's done and most likely the power 

2620
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:27,761
grids jack for a long time to right now 
the detail now you have 10 more minutes.

2621
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,450
So I had to get the stePhen hawkings 
quote out for you.

2622
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:36,020
I'm stephen hawkings was talking about 
the,

2623
02:03:36,021 --> 02:03:41,021
um,
the possIbility of alien life 

2624
02:03:41,021 --> 02:03:41,810
discovering us and that it would be a 
terrible,

2625
02:03:41,811 --> 02:03:46,811
terrible thing if it did happen.
If you look at what has happened to 

2626
02:03:46,811 --> 02:03:49,670
other primitive lifeforms and we 
discovered them apparently have cultures

2627
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:54,870
and we have discovered them.
Do you share that same opinion that if 

2628
02:03:54,870 --> 02:03:57,671
something did find us a.
I don't have a strong opinion on that 

2629
02:03:57,671 --> 02:03:58,790
question,
but I have an analysis of his comment.

2630
02:03:58,990 --> 02:04:03,990
Okay.
He is worried about the possibility of 

2631
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:10,070
aliens enslaving us.
Oh,

2632
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:16,240
based on the reality that we've done 
that to ourselves.

2633
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:17,990
Yes.
Just think about that.

2634
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:23,030
His fear of aliens derived not from 
actual knowledge of aliens,

2635
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:25,910
but from an actual knowledge of 
ourselves.

2636
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:29,660
AnytIme a more advanced civilization is 
copano,

2637
02:04:29,661 --> 02:04:31,680
let's,
if it technologically advanced civil,

2638
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,030
it did not bode well for the less 
advanced civilization.

2639
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:37,740
And that happened in north America,
south America,

2640
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:38,130
north

2641
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,660
America with,
with european,

2642
02:04:39,661 --> 02:04:41,190
south american,
spanish,

2643
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:42,760
uh,
um,

2644
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:44,090
Australia,
with the,

2645
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:49,180
with the brits never boded well for the 
less technologically advanced 

2646
02:04:50,221 --> 02:04:55,221
civilization.
His factual knowledge of that leads him 

2647
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:58,590
to suspect that aliens would be exactly 
the same,

2648
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:01,950
and I,
I'm not that skeptical.

2649
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:07,700
I don't think all life forms in the 
universe have the basil,

2650
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:16,310
primal,
violent attitudes that we do as a 

2651
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:17,370
species have not been given reason to 
think so,

2652
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:22,580
but don't you believe that things 
advanced because of competition and 

2653
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:24,000
competition forces things to be fairly 
ruthless.

2654
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:29,030
It has been argued that if you colonize,
if you a civilization that colonizes the

2655
02:05:29,041 --> 02:05:34,041
galaxy,
that it's a self limiting exercise.

2656
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,260
Why?
Because here you've got you ready?

2657
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:39,510
We start here on earth is you and me,
boy.

2658
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:41,940
All right,
and you take that plan.

2659
02:05:41,941 --> 02:05:46,380
I take this pLanet and now we have both 
have offspring that are just like us and

2660
02:05:46,381 --> 02:05:47,580
we want more planets.

2661
02:05:47,930 --> 02:05:52,930
Alright?
We reach a point where expansion is not 

2662
02:05:52,930 --> 02:05:57,680
possible because we are worrying with 
ourselves to gain the territory that 

2663
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:03,801
each other has obtained.
So it has been argued sociologically 

2664
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:09,710
that the very act of wanting to colonize
is self limiting against successful 

2665
02:06:13,021 --> 02:06:15,740
colonization of the galaxy.
Because to colonize the galaxy,

2666
02:06:15,741 --> 02:06:18,150
it has to be done in an organized way.
All right,

2667
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:20,130
you take this sector,
I take this sector,

2668
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:25,280
but if I want territory and I want it 
now and my kids want it now I want that 

2669
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,610
territory,
not this other one.

2670
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,630
In fact,
I want it all.

2671
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:32,950
That kind of attitude breeds violence.
It breeds war,

2672
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:39,120
intergalactic war,
so it may be that the very kind of 

2673
02:06:40,351 --> 02:06:45,351
civilization that could peacefully 
colonize a galaxy is not the kind of 

2674
02:06:46,261 --> 02:06:48,450
civilization that would colonize the 
galaxy at all.

2675
02:06:48,490 --> 02:06:49,710
Well,
that's heavy.

2676
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:52,750
Very heavy.
What about the idea that.

2677
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:56,610
That's my first comment about steven.
One he's got,

2678
02:06:56,611 --> 02:07:01,611
he made another comment about we should 
be a multiplanetary species and check 

2679
02:07:01,611 --> 02:07:04,650
ourselves against an asteroid rendering 
one extinct.

2680
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:07,470
It makes a good headline and it sounds 
like it makes sense,

2681
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:11,210
but I'm not.
I'm not there with it yet.

2682
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:13,590
Of course I want a backup.
Of course.

2683
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:15,630
Let's be a multi planet species.
Fine,

2684
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:16,480
but.
But I,

2685
02:07:16,481 --> 02:07:18,510
I would do it for different reasons.
I would do because it's cool.

2686
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:23,780
Not because we want to protect human,
the human species from extinction.

2687
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:26,370
No,
that wouldn't be the reason to do it.

2688
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:31,520
Can I tell you why?
Please list every reason why you think 

2689
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:31,520
we go extinct.
One,

2690
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,840
we trash earth another and we can't live
off of it anymore.

2691
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:37,750
An asteroid is coming through.
Some nanobots gone astray.

2692
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:40,300
Okay?
Pandemic virus,

2693
02:07:40,301 --> 02:07:41,200
pandemics.
Okay,

2694
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:47,100
so it seems to me that if I want to be a
multiplanetary species,

2695
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:50,560
mars would be the one because it's a 24 
hour day.

2696
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:54,550
it's got seasons we would have to 
terraform at first,

2697
02:07:54,551 --> 02:07:57,100
but then we all moved there.
Who to ship a billion people there.

2698
02:07:57,101 --> 02:07:58,630
HeRe's my.
Here's my point.

2699
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:04,470
Would every takes to terraform mars and 
ship a billion people there.

2700
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:08,800
It's got to be easier to deflect the 
asteroid,

2701
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:14,170
whatever it takes to terraform mars to 
turn it into earth.

2702
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:18,730
If you had the power of geoengineering 
to do that,

2703
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:23,650
then you have the power geoengineering 
to turn earth back into earth.

2704
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,360
But there are occasionally,
uh,

2705
02:08:25,361 --> 02:08:26,650
things that we miss,
right?

2706
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:28,450
Because of the way that.
So,

2707
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:29,710
so,
so you say,

2708
02:08:29,711 --> 02:08:34,711
okay,
whatever it takes to geo engineer mars 

2709
02:08:34,711 --> 02:08:39,601
and ship a billion people there,
it's got to be easier to create a 

2710
02:08:39,601 --> 02:08:43,561
perfect viral serum that makes us immune
to all possible disease.

2711
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:48,520
It's got to be easier,
whatever that takes,

2712
02:08:48,521 --> 02:08:53,521
but isn't it possible that there some 
asteroids that we just will not see 

2713
02:08:53,521 --> 02:08:57,010
until it's too late?
Then you put up with whatever that 

2714
02:08:57,010 --> 02:08:57,010
takes.

2715
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:59,420
I mean,
whatever,

2716
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,940
but their time about being labels ship a
billion people there.

2717
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,530
A bill w why?
Of course,

2718
02:09:05,531 --> 02:09:06,810
why wouldn't it be?
We have said,

2719
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:08,170
what do you put 10 people there?
What?

2720
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,350
You want to split your species,
right?

2721
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:15,420
Okay,
and if an asteroid is coming that you 

2722
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:18,571
can't deflect,
which would surprise me if you could 

2723
02:09:18,571 --> 02:09:19,360
ship a billion people.
TomorroW's you just let them all die.

2724
02:09:20,190 --> 02:09:25,190
What is that?
What you plan to you to let all the 

2725
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:25,190
earth people die in the mars people.
Sarah,

2726
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:26,590
just so you can save this.
Don't save everybody.

2727
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:32,250
I'm not buying into the premise this 
cable car ology premise that you have to

2728
02:09:33,371 --> 02:09:36,670
save one to not save the other and you 
know,

2729
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:37,580
cable cardiology,
youth.

2730
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:38,980
I see what you see.
The cable car,

2731
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:42,100
you know someone's in the tracks,
you let them go,

2732
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:42,800
you let them go.
You've,

2733
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:47,810
you've steered out of the way,
but then you actively kill two people 

2734
02:09:47,810 --> 02:09:47,810
instead of passively killing one person.

2735
02:09:47,810 --> 02:09:51,930
What do you do?
I'm not buying into that premise for 

2736
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:54,631
this question.
I'm Simply saying that whatever it 

2737
02:09:54,631 --> 02:09:58,561
takes,
it's got to be easier to put up some 

2738
02:09:58,561 --> 02:10:01,561
kind of net that finds any asteroid that
could possibly harm us and zaps them out

2739
02:10:01,751 --> 02:10:05,110
of the sky has got to be easy.
As the last question is,

2740
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:10,120
is it possible that the reason why we 
are never visited by extraterrestrials 

2741
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:13,460
is because the way civilization,
the space debris one,

2742
02:10:14,190 --> 02:10:17,170
is it because the physicians they have 
visited,

2743
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:22,740
they visited during comicon,
like cosplay costumes weren't as good as

2744
02:10:26,531 --> 02:10:27,880
ours.
Three,

2745
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:28,990
three,
three,

2746
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:34,100
they've observed us and judged there no 
sign of intelligent

2747
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,970
life on earth.
Okay,

2748
02:10:34,971 --> 02:10:39,971
but is there another possibility that 
civilizations don't ever get to travel 

2749
02:10:39,981 --> 02:10:44,981
like that?
Because what happens is as they advance 

2750
02:10:44,981 --> 02:10:45,440
and as our technology advances,
they become,

2751
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:50,980
instead of a biological entity seeking 
to spread its genetics throughout the 

2752
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:55,481
universe,
they become some sort of symbiotic 

2753
02:10:55,481 --> 02:10:58,211
artificial life that as they create,
as they advanced their technology and as

2754
02:10:59,181 --> 02:11:04,181
they continued to innovate,
they reach a limitation in biology and 

2755
02:11:04,181 --> 02:11:08,441
that eventually create artificial life 
that sees no desire whatsoever to 

2756
02:11:08,441 --> 02:11:09,080
travel.
Oh,

2757
02:11:09,081 --> 02:11:14,081
interesting.
So I would say that's a great 

2758
02:11:14,081 --> 02:11:17,240
philosophical question.
I would say that the day we create ai,

2759
02:11:18,490 --> 02:11:23,490
if the ai is everything we are except 
more or not emotional,

2760
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:29,800
then I have an urge to explore.
maybe otherwise wouldn't have create 

2761
02:11:30,061 --> 02:11:35,061
those doors like in monsters inc and 
start going dimension to dementia 

2762
02:11:35,061 --> 02:11:37,490
instead of fucking around with jetson.
Yeah.

2763
02:11:37,550 --> 02:11:38,000
Right,
right,

2764
02:11:38,001 --> 02:11:38,540
right,
right,

2765
02:11:38,541 --> 02:11:38,930
right.
Yeah.

2766
02:11:38,931 --> 02:11:40,310
They figured out the fourth dimension.
Yeah.

2767
02:11:40,311 --> 02:11:42,020
Wouldn't that be the best way to do 
things?

2768
02:11:42,021 --> 02:11:47,021
And then they figure it out and then 
they would figure out a way to travel 

2769
02:11:47,021 --> 02:11:49,271
better than any way we could.
But if the fact that we want to travel 

2770
02:11:49,271 --> 02:11:50,630
and we creating versions of ourselves 
called ai,

2771
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:54,230
why would it be?
I wouldn't want to travel,

2772
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:58,430
but why would it be curious if ai fit is
us this logical,

2773
02:11:58,630 --> 02:12:00,500
then it's not?
Well,

2774
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:05,920
if we create every neurosynaptic ma map 
right,

2775
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:13,360
of our brain into silicon,
into a computer and recreate our 

2776
02:12:13,731 --> 02:12:16,580
consciousness as humans,
the human brain,

2777
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:21,670
but wouldn't the human brain version of 
ai would there be like an infinite 

2778
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:22,880
version of ai that ai could create 
itself?

2779
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:27,920
Because why would it limit itself to all
of our emotions and sexual desires and 

2780
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:29,690
jealousy and all the ridiculous things 
that are holding us back?

2781
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:31,070
It could.
sure,

2782
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:36,760
sure.
Now I'm not as fearsome of ai as others 

2783
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:36,760
are.
Uh,

2784
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:36,860
I,
I,

2785
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:38,100
you know,
we,

2786
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:43,570
we're not going to make an ai looking 
human being because the human form is 

2787
02:12:43,570 --> 02:12:44,420
not the best or ideal forum for 
anything.

2788
02:12:44,421 --> 02:12:46,070
Did you see x makena?
Yes.

2789
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:48,200
I love it because you love.
It is good.

2790
02:12:48,201 --> 02:12:53,201
It was good.
That's good moments that he didn't love 

2791
02:12:53,201 --> 02:12:53,201
it.
No,

2792
02:12:53,201 --> 02:12:53,201
it was good.
I loved it.

2793
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:55,470
I want to marry it.
Do you want to marry it?

2794
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:56,310
Oh,
okay.

2795
02:12:56,780 --> 02:13:01,030
Well that's the first thing you bought.
It's not even that.

2796
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:03,620
That's where the money for sure,
for sure.

2797
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:04,580
Yeah,
for sure.

2798
02:13:04,581 --> 02:13:06,140
But I'm just saying it's one of my 
favorite movies.

2799
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:08,030
I want to marry the movie.
It was just awesome movie.

2800
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:13,060
So then marriage would no longer be 
about sex or just to be about 

2801
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:13,060
reproduction because you just go to your
room with your sexual.

2802
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:17,500
I'm hoping that that's one of the first 
things that people figured out they 

2803
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:17,500
shouldn't do anymore.
What else?

2804
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:19,280
They get smart enough to symbiotically 
attach themselves to.

2805
02:13:19,281 --> 02:13:21,290
Artificial intelligence was watching.
What was it?

2806
02:13:21,291 --> 02:13:22,910
Family feud.
One of the questions was,

2807
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:24,520
uh,
if you're.

2808
02:13:27,310 --> 02:13:32,310
We asked 100 married women,
if you could have a second husband for 

2809
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:32,340
only one purpose,
what would it be?

2810
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:36,360
Something like 70 percent of them said 
just for sex.

2811
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:38,300
Whoa.
Damn.

2812
02:13:39,010 --> 02:13:42,570
Second husband for only one purpose.
Just just for getting stuffed.

2813
02:13:42,660 --> 02:13:47,660
Just just said.
That's a fucking wake up call for a lot 

2814
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:49,620
of guns out there guys.
Let's end on that.

2815
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:54,150
Neil degrasse tyson.
Astrophysics for people in a hurry.

2816
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:59,280
But thank you so much sir.
You're a gentleman and a scholar of you,

2817
02:13:59,281 --> 02:14:00,120
man.
I love you too,

2818
02:14:00,121 --> 02:14:05,121
brother.
Thank you so much for coming here and 

2819
02:14:05,121 --> 02:14:05,121
thank you anytime.
Open invitation middle of the night,

2820
02:14:05,121 --> 02:14:06,960
and come down here.
We'll open it up and you got to wake him

2821
02:14:06,961 --> 02:14:07,800
up.
He'll do it.

2822
02:14:07,810 --> 02:14:09,330
He's down.
He loves you too.

2823
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:10,640
all right.
Thank you sir.

2824
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:11,190
Appreciate it.

2825
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:14,100
