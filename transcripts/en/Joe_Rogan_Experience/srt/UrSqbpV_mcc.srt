1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,081
Try my day.

2
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:03,750
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,410
Uh,

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,041
she was in there.

5
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,180
I never worked with shoes in there.

6
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:06,540
Great,

7
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,373
great person.

8
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,580
Freak freak.

9
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,100
It's crazy how this fucking
sport just chews people up.

10
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,280
You think you're on top and
then it's gone and it's over.

11
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,890
But the casual fan doesn't kill.

12
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,180
That's why that paper you a cell
because the casual fan goes,

13
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:18,301
oh,

14
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,430
that's the girl who worked Ronda Rousey.

15
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:24,750
That's the argument from a Gregor
versus Floyd Bates fucking happening.

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,763
That's happening,

17
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,920
but it's going to happen.

18
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,843
See,

19
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,150
so McGregor,

20
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,150
it held a press conference last night,

21
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,901
sold out arena.

22
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,310
5,000 tickets sold out the on the mic.

23
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,870
He goes,

24
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,010
fuck the UFC.

25
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,570
Fuck everything.

26
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:39,811
He said,

27
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:41,400
fuck boxing you.

28
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,990
And he goes to the next fight,

29
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,913
the next fight.

30
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,000
Me Verse Floyd.

31
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,470
He was fully get it fucking done.

32
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,131
And then he goes,

33
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,930
I'm going to do it with
or without the UFC.

34
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,950
And they told Dana that.

35
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,670
He goes,

36
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,503
good luck with that.

37
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,470
Good luck getting that done with that.

38
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,890
He believes it with the Ali Act.

39
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,890
He can actually do it because
it's a different sport.

40
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,110
He has the money to hire
the lawyers to try it.

41
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:01,680
Well it's,

42
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,270
it is an interesting argument
because it's not MMA boxing.

43
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:08,910
So if it's boxing it's not,

44
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,840
he doesn't have a contrast.

45
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,550
She should just promote it anyways
and work together with Floyd and say,

46
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,041
well done.

47
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,150
It's not just with Floyd,

48
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,720
it's with McGregor promotions
now that he's got his own thing.

49
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,930
That's the key to promote
because they don't want it.

50
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,000
They don't want to have a third middleman
in Dana white cause you have Conor

51
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,541
McGregor promotions,

52
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,171
Floyd Mayweather it,

53
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,260
and then the UFC,

54
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,090
they don't want to give the,

55
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,510
you is going to become what boxing is.

56
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,810
It's going to become that
because it's star driven.

57
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,910
Like all things like music,

58
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:36,191
hate,

59
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:36,961
like comedy,

60
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:37,531
like everything.

61
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,330
It's going to stay star driven.

62
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,220
And when it's star driven like that,

63
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,190
guys like Connor who are legitimate stars,

64
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,460
they have the leverage and they're
going to manipulate that leverage.

65
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,440
They're gonna utilize that leverage
and we're going to see what happened.

66
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,780
Especially right now I just started,

67
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,560
we've ever had,

68
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,670
it's a reality star driven,

69
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,720
but it is a reality.

70
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,291
Why is it?

71
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:55,951
Why do you hate that?

72
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:57,630
Because it's always been
like that in boxing.

73
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:57,931
Well,

74
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:58,230
right.

75
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,780
I mean that's how they make the
hundred million dollar paydays.

76
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,310
He's a purist and real quick.

77
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,121
Yeah,

78
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:03,720
me too.

79
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,280
But I would love to see Conor was Floyd.

80
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:05,960
Rob,

81
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
rob and I were talking about fights.

82
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,120
This dude said he's never seen a fight.

83
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:09,960
He doesn't lie.

84
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,023
Every single fight.

85
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,020
I've hated a lot of fun.

86
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,300
You see Kimbo and Donna.

87
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,870
Okay.

88
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,300
That you got right to it.

89
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:18,811
Quick.

90
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,590
Right to the point that maybe there maybe.

91
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,140
I did see one seen some shitty fight,

92
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,650
fight,

93
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:25,961
fight,

94
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:26,311
and he was like,

95
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,144
I liked

96
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,063
each other out.

97
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Gracie's last bite on Bella coil cable.

98
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,911
We were talking about it.

99
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:35,744
I liked it too.

100
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,150
This is what I liked about
that all bullshit aside.

101
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,710
How Gracie fought a fucking killer.

102
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,050
I mean that guy knocked
out Joe Schilling twice.

103
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,470
He knocked him out and kickboxing
and he knocked him out in MMA.

104
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,500
He's a fucking beast.

105
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,120
He's a very dangerous striker.

106
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:50,760
He's a very big guy
and he's fucking scary.

107
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,490
He's a blaster and how it,

108
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,370
nothing.

109
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:53,521
No,

110
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:53,880
no,

111
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,240
no.

112
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,470
He avoided getting knocked down.

113
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,470
Your boy who's a beast in
new mouth because he scared.

114
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,160
He was worried about getting taken down.

115
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,410
It was scary to get strangled.

116
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,830
And what were you scared of is what
happened in the last minute of the last

117
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,040
round when I did take him
down past his garlic butter,

118
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,040
fucking mounted him and
had him in a bad spot.

119
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,650
Haluk was going to fuck him
up if that fight kept going,

120
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,480
if that was in the first
minute of the first round,

121
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
how might fight with fuel to do it
because he hit the guy that you guys think

122
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,170
that was entertaining fight.

123
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,113
Fuck,

124
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,033
fuck,

125
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,443
fuck.

126
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,383
That's great.

127
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,440
And you hated Kim overs.com
that was more hate it.

128
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,301
I didn't hate him,

129
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,930
but it was not a high level fight.

130
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,000
I hated the fact that people were watching
it on TV and both guys were severely

131
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,990
unconditioned.

132
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,880
There were severely out of shape.

133
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,763
Like,

134
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:44,530
no,

135
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,363
I didn't.

136
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,630
His heartbeat stopped
the hip Revit enough.

137
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:47,981
That's true.

138
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,330
Is that some of that is him,

139
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,863
but uh,

140
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,111
no.

141
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:53,201
I,

142
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:53,861
when I think about it,

143
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,221
honestly,

144
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,480
I hated what the fight was about,

145
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,230
but I love the fight,

146
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,230
the dynamic of what's happening between
these two human beings in combat.

147
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,810
I mean dot.

148
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,320
And Kimbo.

149
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,501
Yeah.

150
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:03,100
Even that one,

151
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,090
the dynamic between them is different
than every other fight in their case,

152
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,720
Mike,

153
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,770
because chose Mike.

154
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,150
Jamie.

155
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,983
Yeah.

156
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,970
If it was my student
out until I was about,

157
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,710
are you intrigued by the,

158
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:15,700
by the time Mcgregor,

159
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:16,331
Floyd Mayweather.

160
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,540
I said as if Conor McGregor could
actually box with Floyd Mayweather.

161
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,580
Mcgregor cannot box with Floyd Mayweather,

162
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,140
but Conor Mcgregor's what?

163
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,430
The only goal that he could have the
workable idea as a backdoor hack.

164
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,760
Something where being unwilling
to make it a boxing match.

165
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,440
He is fighting him with two hands.

166
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,280
But boxing is not the definition
of fighting with two hands.

167
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,120
Find a hack,

168
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:37,721
find a back door.

169
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,280
What would Tim Ferriss do if Tim,

170
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,150
if you said,

171
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,331
hey,

172
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:41,130
Tim Ferris,

173
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,370
how,

174
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,320
how do you beat Floyd Mayweather with a
guy who's never pushed him off the stand

175
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,163
yet?

176
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,010
You'd want someone else's
idea and regurgitate.

177
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,873
Yeah.

178
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,833
Yeah.

179
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,480
It's not that easy.

180
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:52,841
No,

181
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:53,381
it's not.

182
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,920
But Mcgregor has found the disruption.

183
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,420
Okay.
