1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,023
Court.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,060
Is that it? Yeah. Hello, we're back.
We're back folks. You know, we,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
we ended on a very important point and
we ended on a point so important that we

4
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,450
had to bring it back up again.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:19,680
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,440
The lack of manliness in this fucking
country, ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,820
it's me and here's his salt.
Here's something for you man.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,790
And this is, you look at
cinema today. Cinemas,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,530
a big thing in the United States. It
always has been. It sets trends. It sets,

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,730
you know, kind of people's
morals to a certain extent.

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,830
So let me read you this. Let
me read you this IDP. I was,

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,130
how do you say that database?
Yes. That Guy Idb oh, this man.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,740
And he's one of my favorite dudes ever.

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,880
But I'm going to read you this list of
films he was involved with either as a

15
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,800
screenwriter or a writer.
Okay.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,790
Which as a screenwriter and a rider is
a guy who comes up with the idea of the

17
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,420
fucking movie. So that's pretty
important. It's huge. So here we go.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,100
Here's a list of movies for you.
Dirty Harry, Jeremiah Johnson.

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,360
Well, the life and times of
Judge Roy Bean tease Paul Newman,

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,400
magnum force apocalypse now,
Jesus,

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,590
1941 comedy with John Belushi,
Conan the barbarian,

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,290
the first one,
original 1982,

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,310
the one that made Arnold Schwarzenegger
is star and Future Governor of

24
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:32,340
California Cohen on what is best in life.

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,420
I still enemies to the living
before you and hear the lamination.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,420
Uh, uh, and I, and to
me personally, this is,

27
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,340
I'm a child of the 80s, so this
is like my movie, my goto thing.

28
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,210
Red Dawn, he wrote the screenplay for
right. First of all, how dare you,

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,870
how dare he both of you go fuck
yourself. That movie's terrible. Fuck,

30
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,260
I'm not drive in a 78 Firebird any more
hoodies and I'm not living in that time

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,660
frame. Would that right back
off man? Red Dawn, the shit,

32
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,900
the shit. What's Red
Dragon Wolverines, mother,

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,080
whatever it is. You said red
dragons. That's it man. That's like,

34
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,160
that's one like overeating.

35
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,780
It makes me sad that you don't know
that it's a good movie or as good as

36
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:29,380
roadhouse doe. Clear and present
danger. Uh, Laurie yet Rome,

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,300
the TV series, 22 episodes. I was
a legit TV. Do you ever watch that?

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,370
Rome. What year was that?
Uh, 2005 HBO series.

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,630
Wow. I don't think I
did. It was a legit, um,

40
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,700
that's a must be post gladiator. They
decided to do that and yeah, probably.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,470
Yeah. That, that thing. Patrick
Swayze. Yes. Right there, baby.

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,390
That's the, that's the original legit
red dawn. Is that the trailer? Yeah.

43
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,650
Peter tried to tell me Span Johnson.
Ben Johnson was a mother fucking gangster.

44
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,930
Swayze died from cigarettes. They
tried to say that. Did he? I,

45
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,110
I watched the last, uh, on
Netflix and says, Shit. The beast,

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,970
the last series that he did, yes.
And it was pretty good, but God damn,

47
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,400
he looked bad. It looked
terrible. I mean, it was like,

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,340
you felt so bad cause
roadhouse was a legit movie.

49
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,330
Religious hard to fuck with
that. Awesome. We terrible. Hey,

50
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,520
it's hard to fuck with that.
It's got,

51
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:32,500
Patrick Swayze is a Boucher
with Sam Elliott as his mentor.

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,310
And Ben, who's Ben Vareen is, yes,
the bad guy. The bad guy. I own,

53
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,400
but I don't care. Whoever the chick was
with the giant jugs. Oh, she's so pretty.

54
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,300
Yeah, she was. She's just fucking smart
too. I'm sure she didn't take care of you.

55
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,000
She was a doctor. She
was huge. Stitch you up,

56
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,220
send you back out into the battlefield.
Basically.

57
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,880
The perfect woman accepts you as you go.
It looks like a rubber blowup doll.

58
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,860
It's been left out in
the sun for 20 years.

59
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,870
You could take a picture of her right now.

60
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,160
I don't want to take a picture of it and
I want to go back in time back in 19 I

61
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:06,640
don't want to smell her vagina when
it smelled like paradise wrote about.

62
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,160
Uh, well, I don't want to bring
that up. We don't want to get,

63
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,720
you don't want to stir up too much shit,

64
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:12,310
but I was going to say
at that point in time,

65
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,320
that was like the Steven Seagal era.

66
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,450
That's when Steven Seagal like roadhouse
was that Steven Seagal was like right

67
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:24,160
about there because Steven Seagal started
with above the law. That was legit.

68
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,660
That was like 90 91 right around that era.

69
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,700
89 maybe that's when roadhouse
was roadhouse was 89 and
it was awesome and it's

70
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:37,360
still awesome.
Oh,

71
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:41,950
it's got some of the best lines
ever until it's time to not be nice.

72
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,930
Yeah. How do we know when that is?
I'll let you know. Pain don't hurt.

73
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,650
Oh, that's, that was great stuff,
dude. He looks at say, well Sam,

74
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,720
it's been a gangster forever,

75
00:04:55,721 --> 00:05:00,330
but actually above the law cane before
roadhouse. It was a eight, eight,

76
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:03,160
four 88.
That was just first movie.

77
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,730
Like he's doing Kung Fu and he was hanging
out with that dude who was, uh, Jeff.

78
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,920
Uh, the guy was, the guy was
blind and grape scenarios. Yes.

79
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,240
Great Blues Guy. Yeah. Kelly
Lynch. That's her name. Right.

80
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,730
So pretty.
You're so fucking hot.

81
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:22,120
I don't even want to know
what she looks like now.

82
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,200
She will forever look like she
looked at in my eyes. Oh, this,

83
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,890
that's the monster truck days.

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,900
Got Girls got entirely too many brains
to have an ass like that. No, it's fine.

85
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,840
That's fine. That's a quote from
Sam Elliott. It's ridiculous.

86
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:37,870
Sam Elliott was incorrect. It's just
a matter of being able to handle it.

87
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,760
Look at the little chicken chest.
I'm Patrick Swayze. He's so lucky.

88
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,050
There's no black man in that movie.

89
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,940
So lucky because there was a black
man that got injured. They did.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,580
They did the fucked up graphic.
That was the,

91
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,810
they didn't have the original graphic.
Oh Wow.

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,640
That's probably a post
that was failing three.

93
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,910
I bet that was an early trailer Mip,

94
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,720
but did they have a lot of trailers
back then? Yeah, the early,

95
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,360
if you look at trailers, like a lot of
like big films, they were all dog shit.

96
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,920
Now with the trailer is better than the
fucking movie that I have a real problem

97
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:16,640
or trailers. Now I wait for a bus on the
movie and I try not to see the trailer.

98
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,370
If I could see a trail on my computer,
I'll literally turn away,

99
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,160
but I heard the Godzilla trailer was
nothing. It was just like there was a,

100
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,190
someone said it was amazing trailer and
it's actually a like a proof of concept.

101
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,170
It's a concept.
Okay.

102
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,450
It's not that they just started
filming in recently on a Wahoo.

103
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:36,620
According to Twitter. Have you seen a
move on source? I'm trying to think about,

104
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:37,580
I haven't seen movie.

105
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,160
The last movie that really made me like,
you know what,

106
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:46,670
like that's a bad ass. Like that's a one
for the ages. I'm trying to think of it.

107
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,740
And the closest I can come is it departed.

108
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,170
The department was really good,
but Avatar does it for me. Really.

109
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:58,550
I hadn't dealt with stupid. I know it
was dumb. I know. It requires suspension.

110
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,620
It's a bunch of hippy bullshit. It's
nothing more than one. It's, it's a,

111
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,210
it's like a bunch of fucking, uh, it's
revisionist American Indian history.

112
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,190
You're right. You're right. You're right.
If it was an original thought, you got me.

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,570
I respect the technical aspects of the
filmmaking cause it's fucking amazing

114
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:21,500
what they did.
But the story is straight up.

115
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,910
Fucking put truly bull. You can follow
up with Julie. You're totally right.

116
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,890
You're totally right. However,
I feel it's my feeling that,

117
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,813
um,

118
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,770
a movie like that is a comic book movie
and it's basically a vehicle for just

119
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:41,030
showing you pretty things and getting
you carried away in a story. And, uh, I,

120
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,220
I see your argument,

121
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,330
but I also see the argument
and making it completely.

122
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,600
James Cameron is a fucking genius.
He's a wicked motherfucker.

123
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,710
He's a fucking genius dude. Went down to
the farthest reaches of the ocean south.

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,730
Yes, Matt. I mean south,
I think he's a stud and I,

125
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,940
and I respect what he does and I wish
more people had the balls and ability to

126
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:06,130
do what he does.
I think you,

127
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,310
you've got to have a giant fucking ego
to do what he does. But you know what?

128
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:14,000
You get that ego by making movies that
make hundreds and hundreds of millions of

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,980
dollars. That's so true. You
know, I was talking to um, uh,

130
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,130
people on my message board about, uh,
there was, someone was talking about,

131
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:26,630
there's a, a situation recently
where there was a, a, a billionaire,

132
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,930
a very famous cat who denounce Steve
Jobs and sold all his apple stock.

133
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:35,990
His name is Jay Robertson.
He dumped all his apple shares.

134
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,580
And the reason why I did, he said
Steve Jobs is a really awful person.

135
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,780
Like that's his quote.

136
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,700
And there was like this big debate on
my message board and, and you know,

137
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,840
I started reading it and you know what,

138
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,720
what makes the guy an awful
person and what doesn't? And My,

139
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,320
my take on it was that it's like anybody
running a company like that where

140
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,200
you're running like

141
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,820
an insanely innovative pressure filled
company that's trying to be at the very,

142
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,670
the very front of the line of the most
competitive form of technology available

143
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:13,910
consumer technology in the phone business
should, I mean they, they're, they're,

144
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,840
they're so like attached to people's
like that mean people fight over android

145
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,980
versus apple or you know,
I'm, I've got a windows phone,

146
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,420
I'm a fucking contrarian and it's a weird,

147
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,120
very competitive Uber Geek Environment.

148
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,580
And Steve Jobs was the
master of that Shit.

149
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,270
The phones master of the home computer.
He was the master.

150
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:38,070
He made exclusivity. He made the, he,
he came up with the very best stuff.

151
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:42,240
And for him it was like, it was
everything. It was his whole existence.

152
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,910
And for the people that work for him,
it was a job man.

153
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,760
Just like you talking about working at
the auto [inaudible] I'm working for, for,

154
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,960
yeah, it's just a job. If you
had to work for Steve Jobs,

155
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:55,500
you would have fucking nightmare stories
about that con. Yeah. He'd be like,

156
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:56,960
that guy's a douche bag.

157
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,510
It goes.
That's one of the things about,

158
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,030
another thing I'm fascinated by
is with modern media, new media,

159
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,310
um, Facebook, Twitter, everything,
just the way everything is.

160
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,970
It's this thing that if you don't agree
100% with what an entity as a company

161
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:21,680
does or with,
if you think a person is an asshole,

162
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,530
then all of a sudden that
means whatever they make,

163
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:28,250
whatever they do is not cool
or not acceptable anymore.

164
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,500
And to me that's false.

165
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,800
I see. It's positive. I see a,

166
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,840
it represents this unique need for
accountability across the board.

167
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,810
I understand accountability,
but here's the thing, man. If,

168
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,460
if you're in charge of getting something
done, I don't give a fuck who you are.

169
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,540
If you're in charge of making something
and putting product out the door,

170
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,070
somewhere along the line someone's
going to say, you're a fucking asshole.

171
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,030
Sounds going to get butthurt. Yeah.
It's impossible not to that true.

172
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,720
So that's true. But I show now
and it's the fact that, okay,

173
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,460
and I'm, maybe I'm guilty
of it in certain instances,

174
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:09,080
but at the same time it's like,

175
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,850
why not let the person's work speak
for themselves, you know? I mean, okay,

176
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,190
perfect example music. Uh, I try
not to get, I, I'm guilty of this.

177
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,750
I try not to get worked up because
I'm a conservative, pretty much. Dude.

178
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,320
You know, if any, like
I said, I feel like,

179
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,400
and this is a problem that I run into
with most left leaning or whatever you

180
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:32,234
want to call it,

181
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,110
is I'm perfectly willing to let
anybody do whatever the fuck they want.

182
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,870
The flip side of that is, let me
do what the fuck I want. Right.

183
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,000
And that you be a man.
Yeah.

184
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,920
And that's the problem that most people
fucking run into say, no, no, no, no.

185
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:50,330
You'd have to fall within
these parameters. How dare
you want to do x, Y, z.

186
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,310
You can't do that. We need to
control this. Yeah. So my point

187
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,060
is if any of these guys,
you know,

188
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,570
I don't give a fuck if you're a prick.
I don't care if you're an asshole.

189
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,110
I don't care if you got in a fight with
the guy over here or are you getting a

190
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:10,111
lawsuit over some bullshit if your product
does what it says it will you treat

191
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:14,620
me right as a customer?
Why am,

192
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,800
why would I ever be an asshole and not
buy your shit because someone else says

193
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:25,120
they don't like you. Well, I
think it's based on empirical
evidence and what, what,

194
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:29,450
what, what, what? Now, that's
not to say if a guy's a
legitimate fucking prick. Look,

195
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,010
I've heard conversations that other
people have had about me. Right?

196
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,420
Someone has said that I was
a head. I was like, Oh man,

197
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,670
let me tell you what
that guy actually did.

198
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,870
I walked in and said this to my
friend, like right away, Zack,

199
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:47,610
of course I was a dick to him, right?
He's got me the creepy eyes, you know?

200
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,130
He's saying that, I think I'm too
good. Whatever the fuck it is,

201
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:52,000
there's two sides to the story.
Exactly.

202
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,940
And that's the problem
with the way shit is now,

203
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,520
is that all of a sudden
through an onslaught.

204
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,890
Now imagine if you're just a fucking guy,

205
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,080
just a dude that doesn't have a big
media presence and somebody decides to,

206
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,040
you know, you, you, you run into some
asshole out here and they go, hey, look,

207
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,690
you know,
for whatever reason,

208
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:14,260
something goes down and all of a sudden
they want to make you the asshole.

209
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,420
Now that's, I mean, is it right?
Is it wrong? Not so much. Well,

210
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:22,600
they're trying to reshape reality and
they're trying to influence other people's

211
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,060
opinions to justify their own opinion.
Not only that,

212
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:30,061
but there is a fucking mob mentality
of let's jump on board and you know,

213
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:34,600
we're going to fuck this guy. And I know
for a fact you've been a victim of it.

214
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,010
Me. Yeah, absolutely. Perfect example. I
mean, you're outspoken on certain shit.

215
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,170
Perfect example was with the, uh,
uh, the, the, the transsexual thing.

216
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,060
I mean you got your fucking nuts kicked
in and certain circles over that it's

217
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:53,710
happened before. I mean, so
that was, it was all important.

218
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,190
You know, that was a, that
was a good thing. That was a,

219
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,300
that was important for dialogue.
Yeah.

220
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,110
Like it's important for those people to
express themselves and be angry at me.

221
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,020
You can't hurt my feelings.
That's all right. I understand.

222
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,660
If you have a version of
reality to difference,

223
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,670
and here's when it comes to describing,

224
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,920
here's what tilt me is when people want
to start fucking with your income. Yeah.

225
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,580
People start going, they don't go to you
what they want to be reacted to know.

226
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,610
They want to go, hey look, you know, fuck
this. We're boycotting the UFC. You know,

227
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,390
they're calling your boss,
or not your boss, but your
employer, Dana white saying,

228
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:28,730
hey look, you know, you need to fire this
guy because he's a fucking asshole. And,

229
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,040
and to me that's just like,
you know,

230
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,860
that's the biggest pussy move on the
planet because they can't argue what you

231
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:39,310
were saying, that they're not
willing to have a dialogue and say,

232
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,700
I disagree with you because of this.
Let me try it.

233
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,120
Let me try to swing you to my way
of working. They want to say no,

234
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:49,390
I disagree with what you're
saying. I'm a pussy, so fuck you.

235
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm going to try and take your money.
Not only that, there's also something

236
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,370
that's going on with people that disagree
with certain people's opinions is that

237
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:59,060
they are absolutely convinced that
they are right and that you are wrong.

238
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,320
So because of that,

239
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:04,490
they're willing to do almost anything
to express the idea that you are wrong,

240
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,680
whether it's distort reality,

241
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:10,100
whether it's to give their
opinion a very biased way,

242
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:14,030
excluding certain aspects of the facts,
whatever it is,

243
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:18,740
there's an ego battle along
with the ideology battle.

244
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,950
My problem is when that ego battle is
so glaringly obvious and you're not

245
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:27,260
willing to admit that that's exactly
what the fuck is going on. You know,

246
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,450
like we said about the transsexual thing,

247
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:33,590
like I'm happy to get the transactional
conversation out there because I think

248
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,780
ultimately once the dust settles,

249
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,500
I think people should realize
that it doesn't matter. You know,

250
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,890
it doesn't matter if someone wants to be
a woman or if someone wants to be a man

251
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,830
or if you want to live your life
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

252
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:47,270
What matters is how do you treat people

253
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,250
well at the same time, this is kind
of been my issue with, uh, I dunno,

254
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,760
alternative lifestyles, whatever the
hell you want to call it. But it's,

255
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,880
there's a difference between acceptance
and it's like, okay, here, look,

256
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,160
I accept the way someone wants to live
their life. No problem. That's on you,

257
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,560
but don't expect me to cheerlead you.
Well, you know what I think that's from,

258
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,870
you know, don't expect me
to be. It's like, you know,

259
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,730
I will accept however you
want to live your life,

260
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,910
but accept the fact that it's possible.

261
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:23,120
There are people out there
that are willing to accept
it and say you're, you're,

262
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,710
you're, you know, that's, you're right.

263
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:28,730
100% but that doesn't mean
they have to agree with it.

264
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,940
And if they don't agree with it,
it doesn't make them a bigot.

265
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,750
Right? Well, people don't have
to agree with anything, you know,

266
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,790
as long as you treat people fairly
and kindly and it doesn't matter.

267
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,860
That's what I really look for.

268
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:45,861
And to me that's a sign of someone
that I will respect is someone that is

269
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:50,460
willing to understand and they
can argue vigorously. You know,

270
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:53,300
that I do not agree with
what you're saying, but,

271
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,330
but I respect your right and your
ability to live the way you want to live.

272
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,260
And I will not degrade you
and I will not hinder you,

273
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,210
but I do not agree with you.

274
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:06,751
Yeah.

275
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:09,600
I think it's a really important point to
know that there's a bunch of different

276
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,650
ways of looking at the world and you
might not agree with my way of looking at

277
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:15,210
the world.
It doesn't mean that you're right,

278
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,410
that doesn't mean that you're
wrong either. It means a,
your, the, the, the fucking,

279
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,880
the spectrum of thinking is so broad.
There's a lot of variabilities.

280
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,811
What's important,

281
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:29,220
I think as a culture and as a community
that anything that we agreed to,

282
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,320
we agreed to on the basis.
Does it cause less harm than it does?

283
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,860
You know, does it co, does it cause
more good than it does harm? Right.

284
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,780
And as long as we act in
that way, we would let allow
anything. Right. Basically,

285
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:44,250
as long as it doesn't victimize people,

286
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,980
man,
that's the way I look at it is,

287
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,280
is I mean I could write up a
bill rights and it would be about

288
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,340
eight sentences and it would
be maybe not even that.

289
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:56,160
Basically it's your rights
end where mine begin.

290
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,800
You don't get to touch children
and you know, that's it.

291
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:06,150
I mean basically just do whatever
the hell you want to do, man.

292
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,930
Let your freak flag fly. But at
the end of the day, you know what?

293
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,170
You've got to pay your taxes.
You got to go to work.

294
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,550
Let your fleet, your freak flag fly. Yeah.

295
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,590
Jimi Hendrix baby. That's it.
That's his line. You know, I mean,

296
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,700
do whatever you gotta do. I don't give
a shit. But at the end of the day,

297
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,190
you're still a member of a community.
So most important thing to say ever,

298
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:33,570
and I fucked it up. Let
your freak flag fly. Yeah,

299
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:38,160
let it free party 2014 starting a
new political party. I saw that.

300
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,023
I'm down with that.

301
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,840
It's a hunter.S Thompson had freak
power and the 1970s I'm going what?

302
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,380
The Freak Party for 2013
out of respect for HST.

303
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,670
You know what's funny is in other
countries with parliamentary systems,

304
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,770
um, it's designed towards
not a two party deal. Well,

305
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:59,700
my point is you can do,
I mean no party and now the countries,

306
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,040
I mean you could legitimately no bullshit.

307
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Probably put together a freak party
and maybe get one or two house,

308
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,460
you know, house members and they would
have, you know, but I mean that's,

309
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:14,910
that's what's crazy.
I think the way the system was designed,

310
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,360
that was what was in mind. It was
never designed to be two parties. No,

311
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,560
they hijack that. Yeah. And I think
that I could be president of Canada.

312
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,420
If you're willing to move to Vancouver,
we can make some shit happen. I mean,

313
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,770
Edmonton and I can't tell you
for, I mean that's, I love Canada.

314
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,210
You know what I love about Canadians?
They're the nicest people in the world.

315
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:37,770
So Nice. They have beautiful women,
so hot, but fuck, they're communist.

316
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,250
They're communists. Listen, only
when it comes to healthcare,

317
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,840
the only his communist is the
people that you interact with.

318
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,590
If you choose to interact with the people
that are all social Isti and they're

319
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,810
trying to fucking make it the NERF,

320
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:53,280
the world and provide [inaudible].
I got two topics for us.

321
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,420
Number one.

322
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,640
Tell me what the fuck you would have done
in New York City if it would have been

323
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:04,200
your wife and your two kids
and an SUV and that SUV thing.

324
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,590
Here's my take on that and I'm
sure you've talked about before,

325
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:11,290
but I haven't really, it's the SUV, um,

326
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,140
motorcycle biker thing.
I don't know how that guy was driving.

327
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,800
I don't know what happened.
I don't know if anyone was aggressive.

328
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,570
I don't know if anyone was clueless.

329
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,600
I literally don't know what I looked at
when I saw the end where that guy drove

330
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,480
over those people and uh,
drove over those bikes.

331
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,710
I saw a guy who looked like he was
panicking and it looked like he was

332
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,544
surrounded.

333
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,880
But without the information of hearing
what these guys were saying to him or

334
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,320
what had happened before that I don't,
you know, I saw the one guy slow down.

335
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:48,100
It's like brake check them,
brake

336
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,510
checked him and,

337
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,540
but apparently something had occurred
before that where the guy had like maybe

338
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,310
bumped into a bike or
gotten too close to a bike,

339
00:20:57,311 --> 00:21:01,030
but apparently something had occurred
before that where they were involved in

340
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:03,140
all [inaudible] with another automobile.

341
00:21:03,141 --> 00:21:06,550
And there's a video of that and there's
a mob mentality sort of an argument to

342
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:09,640
be taken to I think unless you're there.
And you know,

343
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:13,910
there was like three cops, they're
undercover. I think it was five,

344
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,090
six x six is the last I heard was
three in and they arrested one. Well,

345
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,790
you know, cops are people.
There's a problem for sure. Um,

346
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,310
I don't know what the fuck happened,
man. I really don't know who got beat up.

347
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,730
New Video, the new video shows
a guy got beat up apparently.

348
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,670
I don't know who caused what.
I Dunno who deserve what.

349
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,580
I do know that I've been around some
dudes and bikes and act like fucking cock

350
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:38,414
suckers,

351
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,920
but I've do know that I've been around
people in cars around bikes and act like

352
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,270
fucking cock suckers.

353
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,380
I do know that people tend to act like
fucking cock suckers when they're in

354
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:48,460
groups especially.
Yeah,

355
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,690
and I don't know if it's the guy in the
truck didn't know what the fuck he was

356
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:56,230
doing or the gun. The bike didn't.
I don't know what happened, man.

357
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,320
I mean, I dunno. I fedec. From what
I've watched and from what I've seen,

358
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,980
one of the best forum posts I've seen
yet that described it was I seriously

359
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:10,980
doubt that that guy in the
SUV woke up that morning,

360
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,540
put his wife and kid in the truck and
said, let's go fuck with some bikers.

361
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,970
But I'm willing to bet at least a few
of those fucking bikers woke up in the

362
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,760
morning, got on their motorcycle and said,
let's go fuck with some of these guys.

363
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,360
Maybe. And it might be, they're just,

364
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:28,040
they all got together and felt
the power in numbers. That's fine.

365
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,300
The same time, you know, the
brake check thing, I mean,

366
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,640
I've read different accounts and I've
seen some different videos and then you

367
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:42,170
look at history.
Past performance is an indicator.

368
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,600
It really is.
You know what people do in the past,

369
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,750
but to me it just looks like,

370
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,100
I don't know.
The biggest thing that flipped my mind,

371
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,550
those motherfuckers chased him
like 50 blocks in Manhattan. Yeah.

372
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,380
You've been in New York?
Yeah.

373
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,560
How the fuck do you do 2030 more recycles
40 motorcycles chasing a guy through

374
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:05,360
Manhattan.
What a fucking cops.

375
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,720
Yeah. Where are the cops were
to cops? I don't know. I mean,

376
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,240
I don't know if he called the cops.
I don't know if he had a flat.

377
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,800
I think you might have
had a flat tire to that.

378
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,520
I don't give a fuck 50 blocks a minute.
You can't drive 50 blocks in van.

379
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,230
You can't.
I mean for fuck sake.

380
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,980
Well, you know who knows
what? What's going to come
out about the undercover cops?

381
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,790
How much information? My question is if
one of those guys were calling them off.

382
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,440
Yeah, it could be. I mean, could be, is
that possible? I don't know. You know,

383
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,280
like I said, both sides
are gross. It's gross.

384
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:38,180
If the guy was disrespecting
the motorcycles or it's gross.

385
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:41,720
If the guy was panicking and putting
people in jeopardy. It's also growing.

386
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:46,010
But here's the thing. Here's the way I
look at the guys stopped the guy brake

387
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,720
checks them. If you just
started that video, dude,
brake checks them. Number one,

388
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,630
if you're on a motorcycle and you brake,
check an SUV,

389
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,770
you're a fucking moron cause you're
gonna lose. Yeah, that sounded good.

390
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,600
That's number one. You're a
dick. Even if you're 100% right,

391
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,160
even if this guy almost ran you off
the fucking road, okay, you got me,

392
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:09,440
you're on the right.
But if you can in front of them and brake,

393
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:13,670
check them and he runs you the fuck over.
Whose fault is that?

394
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,830
Even if you were right to be mad.
So right there,

395
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,143
one wrong.

396
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,620
And so the guy gets on the brakes and
then the next thing he stopped and he's

397
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:28,810
surrounded by these bikes.
Now if you're a guy, and,

398
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,640
and he was the thing, it goes back
to what we started about before.

399
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:36,590
The whole thing about fucking people not
being a man. You know, here's this guy,

400
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,920
probably never been in a fight
in his fucking life. You know,

401
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,740
never had to protect himself,

402
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:47,030
never had to protect his family and he's
surrounded by these fucking assholes.

403
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,140
So what's he do?

404
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,850
Panic. Exactly. Yes. Right. Yeah.

405
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,030
Well it's a scary fucking scenario,
man. If it would have been

406
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,100
me and that position and I was,
well I dunno,

407
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,010
all I gotta say is it would
have been like, I dunno,

408
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,810
you see death race 2000 like
microfilm or like every which way,

409
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:11,990
but loose the remake.
I have been around both.

410
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,990
I've been around very
respectful bikers who do,

411
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,620
they ride down the road like you know,
a hundred strong and you know,

412
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:22,190
waving to people and share and there's
no problems. And I've also seen assholes.

413
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:26,300
I've seen assholes cut people off and
get in front of people. And there's a,

414
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:29,030
there's a thing when you
have ultimate strength,

415
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,660
when most of your life you don't have
ultimate strength most of your life.

416
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,000
You have a shitty job. We have
to respond to your boss, right?

417
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,770
You have a bunch of rules
you have to live by.

418
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,750
And then all of a sudden you're
in this fucking scenario.

419
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:41,840
There's the guy tears the cop. The
guy on the right is a cow. Wow.

420
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,840
The guy who did that,
I ran the duty,

421
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,760
the bike with the,
either that or he,

422
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,820
one of them because at least in the
newspaper I saw the dude had the cut right

423
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:55,430
there. That a guy with the cut on with
the three three piece patch. Yeah.

424
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,540
He's a cop.
Why did he do anything?

425
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,750
Well, the whole, who knows who exactly,
who knows what the fuck happened.

426
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:05,980
And he's one of the cop, he's a cop that
got arrested and charged two felonies.

427
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:06,551
You know,

428
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:09,450
I think that if you're a fucking biker
and you're with a bunch of bikers, right.

429
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,563
This shit,

430
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,450
it's your responsibility to not get
close to SUV is if you can avoid it. No,

431
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,630
but like what just happened right there,
no matter what that guy did,

432
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,230
you don't do that well that was a
gap to the guy ruin it. Ran over.

433
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,360
Yeah. But I mean, if
that guy does that too,

434
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:32,210
I dunno the wrong person with a gun in
his car. Well, no, no. If it was me.

435
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,210
Okay.
And I'm disparity of force.

436
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,430
Any state in the United States,

437
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,220
that is a legal reason for excessive,

438
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,470
right? I don't care if you're,
especially for police officers,

439
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,610
if you're a police officer
and three guys come at you,

440
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,890
even if they don't have
any weapons in their hands,

441
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,110
you are justified to use deadly force.
Because this disparity of force,

442
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,680
no man is, no one person
is expected. You know,

443
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,220
there's nothing in the law that says
you've got to take an ass whipping. Yeah,

444
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:09,330
I mean even if this is one on one, if the
guy's a bad motherfucker know yes. If,

445
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,640
if you're a woman, if you're a
female, say you're 120 pound a year.

446
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:15,240
A man either that if you're 120 pound man,

447
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,270
what have your hundred and 80 and the
guys won 60 and he's got a good punch.

448
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,810
Shoot that motherfucker now.
And the will note now that that is,

449
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:26,070
that can be argued that if you have
a guy that's, you know, if you know,

450
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:29,010
if you're a guy that weighs the same as,
I dunno,

451
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:34,190
pick a fighter and then a fighter of
the same stature who was documented as

452
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:39,660
being a fighter, tries to beat this guy
up and he pulls a weapon and kills him.

453
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,180
He has a legit defense that
don't mean he's going to win.

454
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,050
But here's the one thing,
if you're talking about multiple odds,

455
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:51,060
disparity of force is almost every state
that I've looked at is a legitimate

456
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:55,860
cause for the use of
escalation to deadly force.

457
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,500
So that means if three or
four people come at you,

458
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:01,440
even if they don't have
guns and you do have a gun,

459
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,740
you don't have to take an ass whooping.

460
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,220
We don't have to let four people kick
your fucking head in just because they

461
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:11,430
don't have a gun or a weapon.
Disparity of force should be one person.

462
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:13,080
If you're not a candy person,

463
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:16,320
can be someone who knows how
to fight once to kick your ass.

464
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,940
You don't know how to fight your.man,

465
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,550
you're gonna get knocked unconscious and
the guy's going to stomp you to death

466
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:23,180
while you're on the ground. And
that's the thing that is that. And,

467
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,510
and in most states,

468
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,770
that's the reason why is because
once you get knocked out,

469
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,510
you're dead.
Yeah.

470
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,350
If a guy wants to kill you and the more
you're on Worldstar hip hop, right?

471
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,780
Oh, there's a great video that, uh,

472
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:43,210
unfortunately it's not available
for free, but it's a, it's,

473
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,270
it's a mindset video that I think
a lot of people should watch it.

474
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,190
It's by a guy named Paul how Paul How's
a Delta force operator who was on the

475
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:57,180
ground for Mogadishu, uh, for
the Black Hawk down scenario.

476
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,580
And he made a video and he's a,

477
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,180
he's a law enforcement trainer now
mainly also does civilian classes.

478
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,690
But he has a class about mindset and
what the mines and his mindset video is.

479
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:09,960
This is that.

480
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,670
And I think it's really important in this
day and age is because in this day and

481
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:19,080
age, kids, men, women, everyone is taught,

482
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:23,190
if you're, if you're encountered
with force or if you're
encountered with an APP,

483
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,770
you know, aggression, you give up retreat,

484
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,140
know if somebody tries to Mug
you, give me a wallet. You know,

485
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,180
if somebody tries to break
into your house, you know,

486
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,830
cower and he proves through some videos,

487
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,370
he shows examples, but he's
Trump. His point is this,

488
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,090
is that if your mat with
a situation like this,

489
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,100
and it's so rare and people
like you and I, our lives,

490
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,840
but that makes it even more important
is because if it ever does happen,

491
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,490
you must be prepared. Yeah. And his
point is this is like if you give up,

492
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,020
if you don't fight,
you forfeit all your rights to life.

493
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,220
And then he shows some videos
for assumption. I'm sure
you've seen most of them.

494
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,860
You know, the videos of the guys, uh,

495
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,840
in Mexico getting their fucking
heads chopped off, you know,

496
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:24,210
and he shows videos of the Columbine
massacre where they're walking through,

497
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,070
uh, you know, the cafeteria.

498
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,940
And people are cowering under the tables.
What else are they going to do?

499
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,000
You know, I mean, that was, that's,
that's an argument situation.

500
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:37,090
There's not much a guy could do,
right. But the point is, this is it.

501
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:41,290
You're still there. They're
still helpless. You know,
you, you can do nothing,

502
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,240
right?
If you don't fight,

503
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,560
the only thing you can hope for
is that they don't kill you.

504
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,730
They kill somebody else.

505
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,430
And that mindset of never give up,

506
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,330
you know, if you're going
to die, die a good death.

507
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,020
I think there's a point of view
from a lot of people that, um, have,

508
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,610
they don't have violent tendencies and
they're intimidated by violent tendencies.

509
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,090
There's a point of view where they want
to eliminate all the strength in the

510
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:15,800
world. They want to take away all the
benefits of being armed. All the, the,

511
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:18,700
you know, there's, there's a bunch of
people that discourage martial arts. I've,

512
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:20,510
I've, I've, I've actually
had that argument.

513
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,940
I had that argument with my family when
I started doing martial arts because I

514
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:28,040
was kind of a fucked up
kid. And, uh, my, uh,

515
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,020
my father was really worried that I was
going to become a much more efficient,

516
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,110
dangerous person. Right.
You know, that I was a,

517
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:39,920
a kind of a sketchy kid and then now I've
become a sketchy kid who knows how it

518
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:43,210
was dismantled people. Right.
And it was a real issue. Um,

519
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,160
like with me when I was 14 years old.

520
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,530
And I think that there's a lot of people
that are not inclined to physicality,

521
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:52,670
not inclined to violence,

522
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:55,490
not inclined to aggression that would
like to silence those things in other

523
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:58,880
people instead of deal with the inevitable
reality that those things exist.

524
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,750
And whenever someone tells me, you know,
they started talking about like, you know,

525
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:06,830
a, you know, if this guy said that I
would beat his ass or that I, you know,

526
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:09,740
there's a certain amount of that that
it'll tolerate until I get to a certain

527
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:11,780
point. Like, do you really,
do you know what you would do?

528
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,000
Do you really know what you would do?

529
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,220
Have you ever been in a
violent confrontation? Have,
do you know how to fight,

530
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,010
do not to fight when it's important? Do
you know how to fight? If someone said,

531
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:22,280
are you ready? Are you ready? Go. What'd
you be able to keep your shit together?

532
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,550
Right? Most likely not. If you've
never kept your shit together before,

533
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:28,520
if you never had that experience and
whether or not you've proven your, your,

534
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:31,340
your strength of character,
I'm going to be honest with you.

535
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:33,440
You're going to shit your pants.
You're going to Piss your pants right.

536
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,690
You're going to shit your pants.
You're going to fall apart.

537
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:38,510
As soon as the guy gets a hold of you,
you're going to be breathing so hard.

538
00:32:38,511 --> 00:32:40,280
You're not going to able
to control your heart rate.

539
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,290
You're not going to be able to do it.
You just,

540
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,120
unless you've really thought about this,

541
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:47,480
this is not some sort of like
easily manageable situation.

542
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,610
Real violence is incredibly
scary and incredibly scary.

543
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,350
And if you don't address that as a,

544
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:59,180
as a reality of life and the of life
that existed from fucking 4 billion years

545
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:03,020
ago when the first shitty little single
celled organism crawled out of the ocean

546
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,490
to what happens today in, in
2013 in Los Angeles, there's,

547
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,540
there's a reality to biological
life that you are a fucking part of.

548
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:16,750
And just by painting this Utopian picture
of reality doesn't make the dangerous

549
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:21,851
aspects of reality go away and
your a want to control nature.

550
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,440
It's like, it's an idealistic
sort of a point of view,

551
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:27,770
this Utopian view of the world, but
no one's violent. No one's, you know,

552
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:32,090
have the best achieve that strength
uniformly across the board.

553
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,290
And that's, that's a hard thing for
people to describe for people to swallow.

554
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,430
But the,
the,

555
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:41,270
the most safe environments I've ever
been in when I've been around trained

556
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,630
killers, right? The least amount of
street fights that have ever been at.

557
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,780
Where at the UFC,
when I'm at the USC and I'm backstage,

558
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,710
I've seen one or two scuffles
ever amongst the biggest,

559
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,090
most insane killers. The planners ever
known. It comes to hand to hand combat.

560
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,020
Right. Seemed like a few arguments seem
to huge dudes. Slap dudes, you know,

561
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,050
over hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of fights. Even

562
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,860
when you get egos. I mean,
yeah, he goes, well, yeah,

563
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,590
but even guys who do that,
their ego is checked. Yes.

564
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,470
Because they know that
as good as they are,

565
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:17,040
at some point they got
clipped or even that,

566
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:22,041
it's one of those things to where it goes
back to there's Jeff Cooper is what's

567
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,680
Jeff Colonel Jeff Cooper is considered
the father of the modern pistol

568
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:32,550
technique. No, hear me
out. Most of the things,

569
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:35,100
it sounds kind of silly or
gay. No, it doesn't at all.

570
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:38,730
But most of the talking about pistols.
Yeah, but, but we'll hear, hear me out.

571
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:42,600
Martial arts or martial arts. Oh
yeah, I agree. They really are.

572
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,040
Whether you're fighting with your
hands or this swords, guns, knives.

573
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,350
It really is.
You're talking about fighting.

574
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,430
And the difference is when
you're talking about, uh,

575
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,510
fighting with guns and knives,
the differences,

576
00:34:57,511 --> 00:35:02,100
there's a force vector there and
there's a great James Edwards,

577
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,500
I can't think of his name, but he
made a great point. And that's this.

578
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,780
If you and I are fighting, I can block
your punch. Okay? I can take a block.

579
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,140
Or if I miss and you hit me,

580
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,210
chances are maybe I can take a punch.
You know, maybe you might not nec,

581
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,340
knock me out if you hit me with a punch.

582
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,670
But when you start talking about
fighting with weapons from steel up into

583
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,070
bullets, those are force vectors. Now,

584
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:33,630
if we're fighting with knives or
we're fighting even with sticks,

585
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,610
and I swing, this is a vector, okay? This,

586
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:40,950
this plane is a force vector.

587
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,330
If you're in that plane and I
have a knife, you're fucked.

588
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,560
Bodies cannot take that. If
you, if you throw your arm up,

589
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,010
even if I haven't got a knife this long,
I will cut through both your bones.

590
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:56,700
I'll cut your fucking hand off. Yeah.
Now if we're talking about guns,

591
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,570
even more fucked.
Yeah.

592
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,980
So it's forced vectors and it's a
different way of looking at fighting.

593
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,000
You know when you're talking about hand
to hand martial arts, you can take a hit,

594
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,190
you can block,
you can use that block to Perry,

595
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,830
you can use that block
to pull into an attack.

596
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,620
But when you start talking
about fighting with weapons,

597
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:19,400
the only way you can survive is to not
be there. Yeah. So not get hit. Right.

598
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,500
Not Get cut. Exactly. And so it's just,

599
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:27,501
it's that whole thing of the mindset
of being able to accept your on a fight

600
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,280
except the conditions
you're in and deal with it.

601
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,110
And the people who can do that generally
are because they understand the fact

602
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,380
that they're not fucking invincible.
Nobody's a bad ass.

603
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,670
Everybody can get hit, knocked
out, shot, stabbed, whatever.

604
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,590
No matter what your level of training.

605
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,100
So when you talk about being backstage
with a bunch of guys who spend their

606
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:54,960
lives, understanding that
no matter how good you are,

607
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:59,190
no matter how good your ego is, you
know, you have to keep that in check.

608
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,280
Everybody gets checked her.
Holly,

609
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,380
nobody starts out the
baddest motherfucker ever.

610
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:07,310
You get a few guys like John Jones that
come in with exceptional athleticism and

611
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,670
they do really, really good
right away. But even then,

612
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:14,750
like you look at the Gustafson fight,
even he meets a guy one day that handsome,

613
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,520
you know,
a a handful.

614
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,930
And that's also the training
that a god goes through.

615
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,760
It softens the Ego.
It changes the ego's impact on,

616
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,480
on your consciousness where you ego will
fucking lying to you if you don't get

617
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:32,360
any tests right.
If you don't get any real tests in life,

618
00:37:32,361 --> 00:37:34,910
your ego will have you
all sorts of pumped up,

619
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,490
all sorts of confused
about your abilities.

620
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,500
I've had conversations with people that,
you know,

621
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:42,800
I'm the fucking kicked this fucking
dude's ass and you know, you,

622
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:47,690
you just want to just, you want to
stop time and pull them aside and say,

623
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,430
do you understand what you're even saying?

624
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:52,760
Because you don't really just kick a
guy's ass. Cause if you kicked my ass,

625
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,250
I'm coming back tomorrow with a bat.
Okay.

626
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:58,400
Or a gun or my friends and
we're gonna fuck you up.

627
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,200
I'm not just taking an ass kicking
from some pieces of that. That's

628
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,760
the difference between when you're
talking about sport, you know,

629
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,620
UFC blah, blah blah, or this or that.

630
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,510
And on the street in real life is,

631
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,370
it's, it's funny, I had a, uh,

632
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,610
a friend of mine who was a
marine and he was an auto worker.

633
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,280
The guy had done like
six years in the marines.

634
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:28,020
He wanted to be an auto worker and we
were drinking the bar all the time.

635
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:31,950
But he said something to me probably 10,
maybe 10 years ago,

636
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:35,830
it's always stuck with me. He said,
you know what? Nobody's a bad ass.

637
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,600
It's just comes down to a
question of will you know what?

638
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:45,810
Because if Brock Lesnar
whip my motherfucking ass,

639
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,850
which he would every day,
twice on Sunday,

640
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,360
but if I had the will to do whatever the
fuck that was required to do something

641
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:58,030
evil to him,
if I was willing to go to prison,

642
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,700
if I was willing to give up my life,

643
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,570
you know what some bad,
what happened to him. Right?

644
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,690
And it's how you stay alive. Yes,
exactly. If I lived, if I survive now,

645
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,200
but here's the point,
the point is

646
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,670
it goes back to will most people,

647
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,180
most normal human being people you know,

648
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,150
don't think like that.
But here's, but here,

649
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:26,740
if you look at every fucked up story
in this country when it comes to,

650
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,980
Oh my God, this guy did
something terrible, or Oh my God,

651
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:32,500
look at how fucked up this is.
You know, when it comes down to,

652
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:35,470
it comes down to somebody saying,
I don't give a fuck.

653
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,530
Well, somebody recognizing
what the situation actually
is and then acting. Yeah,

654
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,570
well, no, I mean like every panicking,

655
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,660
every gangster like criminal
motherfucker who's got 40 bodies on them,

656
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,140
you know? I mean, if you've watched,
what's the movie down in Miami,

657
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:57,141
cocaine cowboys and to dos
two was pretty amazing.

658
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,870
Well, you talking about
Zelda is still alive. Well,

659
00:40:00,871 --> 00:40:03,900
she got smoked and Columbia in 2012 yeah,

660
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,040
2012 but then I just got out of
jail before, so, no, no. Yeah,

661
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:11,110
she know she was Zelda fucker.
Zelda.

662
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,390
She's a fucking,
oh,

663
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,560
but the guy that I was
impressed by was the,

664
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,080
the other dude that hit me now guy and
present. And it was, it was his thing was,

665
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:26,160
you know what, Eh, he's not a
tough guy. He's a fucking killer.

666
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,470
No, he's not trying to fight
you. You know, he, he, he'll
wait for you to go home,

667
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,060
fall asleep in your bed. They
don't come in your house, you know,

668
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,970
anyone in your fucking
house. Well, you know,

669
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:39,630
another example of the
distorted perception of people's
in vulnerability is the

670
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,720
iceman cook. Kuklinski yeah. That guy.

671
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,680
I'm still kind of curious as to how much
of his shit was real. Really. Thank you.

672
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:49,780
Bullshit it a lot. I think you had
a lot of bullshit or anything that,

673
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,000
that was at least my, that was the
feeling I got by his interviews.

674
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,170
Let's Google iceman bullshit. Nice. And
we hope we don't get any chocolate, Dale.

675
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,090
But no, I mean, watching Kansas
interviews. I, that was the feeling I got.

676
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,030
I got the feeling he was
a braggart. Really? Yeah.

677
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,210
Interesting. Um, nothing

678
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,450
on the first page. That's fair.
Ice Man. I mean, Hey, I'm,

679
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:17,800
maybe I'll completely fuck
all of bullshit. Let's
try. It's full of bullshit.

680
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,810
Richard Kuklinski, he's
100% full of shit. Oh,

681
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,280
that's the wrong eye span. That's that
guy from, uh, the gay guy who got fat.

682
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,500
He's not gay. I'll tell you what
though, man. You got to admit, I mean,

683
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,170
he some legit roles.

684
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,790
Okay. This is one of the guys
saying hard to beat tombstone.

685
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,970
He's saying Kuklinski is
dangerous and has killed,

686
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:45,280
but not to the extent that he claimed
he did not murder Gullah Gullah,

687
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,670
Dante Costello or de Mayo.
He claimed to have worked with de Mayo.

688
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,620
But apparently it's bullshit.

689
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,100
I don't know if apparently he
exaggerated some things might.

690
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,220
He's probably at fuck crazy guy.
I mean,

691
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,320
no, I mean, that's, yeah, I mean, I
absolutely, I don't deny that, but I,

692
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:05,920
I do get the feeling that,
and I think that happens with
a lot. Um, there are some,

693
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,570
if you'd go to the FBI,
I think it's fbi.gov on youtube channel.

694
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:13,000
It's like youtube, slash, FBI, whatever.

695
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,400
They have a series of interviews with
this asshole who was a serial killer.

696
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,030
Right. And, uh, he, he, they
caught him in Alaska I think,

697
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,410
but he killed over 10 or 10 or 15 years,
like eight or nine people,

698
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,620
something like that.
He ended up killing himself,

699
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,910
hanging himself in a jail cell and the,

700
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,050
but they had,
they put on Youtube,

701
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:40,051
the FBI did the fucking interviews
with him sitting in the thing.

702
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,830
And what's crazy to things that are
crazy is one is they're sitting here and

703
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:49,831
they're talking to this guy and they're
explaining to him why these other police

704
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:54,040
departments are being assholes about
jurisdiction and this and that and why

705
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:55,690
they're holding up certain things.

706
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,590
It sounds like he's buying a house and
the fucking realtors trying to explain to

707
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:03,160
him, you know, why it's taken longer
because they haven't got their clearances.

708
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,130
But anyway,
but this dude is,

709
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,470
it kind of looks like him not
being an asshole, but he's Stan,

710
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,590
you know, kind of long air. No,
good luck. Good looking cat.

711
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,760
You know, someone's going,
no. Does that him? Yes.

712
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,380
While it does have it you Jamie,
right.

713
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:25,060
Told you dog how each do 2012 Jamie
wasn't working for me and Joan had to tell

714
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,630
them, well, you're in Alaska Bro.
Did you hang yourself and go,

715
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,110
I've watched some. Uh, but here's what's
so freaky about this motherfucker.

716
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,260
He didn't know his
victims didn't stock them.

717
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,640
He had a murder kit hidden
and he was on the west coast.

718
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,810
He had property from when he was
a kid or something like that.

719
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,320
And a New York did his family left him
or whatever he stashed or murder kit in

720
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:57,070
New York and the murder
kit had like a tape,

721
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,150
a fucking gloves, uh, rope,
all this other kind of shit.

722
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,970
He was living on the west
coast the whole fucking time.

723
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:10,020
He flew back to New York and evidently
he had seen or or or seen some kind of

724
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:14,830
house or whatever, but he flies
back to New York, kills two people,

725
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,730
man in her life,
dispose of their body just mysteriously.

726
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,830
I then flies back. They didn't catch
him until like 10 or 15 years later.

727
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,660
So he did this several times.
Yes.

728
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,250
So his is Emma was that he
did not know that. Yeah.

729
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,130
He would just pick random as victims.
Had nothing

730
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,510
in common. How they catch him? Uh,
he, I think a chick got away from him.

731
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,850
Yeah,
it Alaska,

732
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,750
well there was one guy and I don't know
if it's the same guy in the last kid

733
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:45,050
that would a fly women out. It would
tell them that he was going to fly them,

734
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,710
like pay like prostitutes,

735
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,910
fly them out to a place where they're
going to get your freak on and a,

736
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:52,650
and then he would tell them like,
listen,

737
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,630
you have one hour and in one hour I'm
going to come find you and I'm going to

738
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:02,310
shoot you and kill you. Stop it.
Yeah. So good luck. Take care.

739
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,370
You got one hour ready go or
whatever it was the whole,

740
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:10,430
the amount of time was and he would go
hunting for women and he killed several.

741
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,210
Yeah. La, I'll pull it up.

742
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:15,270
What did you kill the ones that he was
like or just like random ones or what'd

743
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:19,110
he kill? The ones I keep was at after.
Oh, the ones who was after he would,

744
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,590
he was up on the left there. If somebody
said that to me, I would be like,

745
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,570
where's the nearest
fucking police station,

746
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:29,280
because you won't get me out of there.
His name is Robert Hanson and, uh,

747
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,740
he's an American serial killer,

748
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:35,741
is born in 1939 and he killed between
17 and 21 women near Anchorage,

749
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:37,614
Alaska.

750
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:42,770
He was convicted in 1983 and is currently
serving 461 years and spring creek

751
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,540
correctional centers alive
and Seward. Alaska. Yeah,

752
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,950
yeah, yeah, yeah. And a 1983, 17 year old,

753
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:58,951
Cindy Paulson escaped from him while he
was trying to load her into his Piper

754
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,120
Super Club, which is apparently his
airplane type of jet that lands. And, uh,

755
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:10,140
he was, uh, loading her into this,
uh, airplane and she escaped. But did,

756
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:11,800
did, did. And, uh,

757
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,330
she told police that she had been
offered $200 to perform oral sex,

758
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,690
but when she got into the car dollars
in Alaska and Navia like eight beavers,

759
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,510
he pulled a gun on her and drove
her to his home town of Mole Dune.

760
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,610
And there he took her captive,
a torturing, raping and
sexually assaulting her.

761
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:37,611
He mentioned that she mentioned that
after a he chained her by the neck to a

762
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:39,870
post in the houses basement.

763
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,260
He took a nap on a nearby
couch and when he awoke,

764
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:48,180
he put her in his car and took her to
the Merrill Field Airport where he told

765
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,700
her that he intended to
take her out to his cabin,

766
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,940
which was a meet Shaq on the Nic River
area of a Matt to new Tsca valley

767
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:59,910
accessible only by boat or Bush plane.
That's the gangster move, right,

768
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:02,220
because they can't get out.
They can't go anywhere.

769
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:07,020
And crouched to the backseat of the car
with her risks cuffed behind her body.

770
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:11,910
She waited until Hanson was busy loading
the airplane's cockpit to make a run

771
00:47:11,911 --> 00:47:15,390
for it. And while Hanson's back was
turned, she crawled out of the back seat,

772
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,860
opened up the driver's side door and
took off running near Sixth Avenue,

773
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,510
a nearby sixth avenue.

774
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:25,170
She told police that she had left her
blue sneakers on the passenger side floor.

775
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:30,130
This is a dance back seat as evidence that
she had been in the car. So, um, they,

776
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,750
they pulled them over and
they found it. They found her,
her, uh, her, her, you know,

777
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:35,770
they, they, uh,

778
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,790
pulled over the truck and found her
sneakers and knew that she was telling the

779
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:40,100
truth.

780
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,790
Do you know what's fucked up? If
you go back and you look, I mean,

781
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,270
there's a ton of stories like that,
man, I've never heard of that one.

782
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,230
And I generally, I mean, I'm not like
a serial killer freak or anything,

783
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:53,600
but I mean,
I pay attention to like certain things,

784
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,680
but I've never heard that story.
And I guarantee if you look back,

785
00:47:57,681 --> 00:48:01,790
you could probably find a hundred
more like it, different things.

786
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,780
Maybe not that many people, but
three or four, one or two, whatever.

787
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,610
But it goes back to my opinion that,
you know what,

788
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,240
there are fucking monsters
out there, bro. Yeah.

789
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,470
Well this guy was an hunting champion.
I mean there,

790
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:17,360
there are fucking people out there.
They're legit monsters.

791
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,130
This guy was a monster. He was a monster.
He loved to kill things. He was a world.

792
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,820
He was a Hyundai champion.
He hits established, uh,

793
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,940
several documented records in the pope
and young book of world hunting records.

794
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,090
So this guy was like,
he was a legit hunter,

795
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,780
but it was not exciting enough to him.
So he had decided that, you know what?

796
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:41,460
He was in payments. Hunting women.
Yeah. He's, it's a scary, scary,

797
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:44,460
scary thing. And you look at them on
the fucker. His name is Robert Hanson.

798
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,670
Google it on a Wiki.

799
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,400
That's crazy. Cause Robert Hanson
is the same guy who was a spy for a,

800
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,720
so the FBI wasn't, yeah,
Robert Hansen was a spy for,

801
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,640
I want to say FBI counterterrorist

802
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:03,170
same. Same Dude. No good.
No. Google. Robert Hanson.
FBI. That's not the same guy.

803
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,930
Robert Hansen, that's the A,
I'm sure that's the FBI guy.

804
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:10,640
Robert Hanson on
Wikipedia. H a. N. S. E. N.

805
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,960
That's him. Creepy fuck
killed. 21 women at least.

806
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,380
At least 21 if they clicked them
for 21 you know it's more, yeah,

807
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:23,330
between 17 and 21 is the number
that they're there. But that's,

808
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,150
that's true. But then sometimes,
sometimes they lead others.

809
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,811
Yeah.
Right.

810
00:49:26,811 --> 00:49:30,620
Because they do the shit where they
write off every unsolved on earthing,

811
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,260
chalk it up to them.
And we,

812
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,660
which a serial killer or did you ever
see that documentary? Not Documentary.

813
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:41,250
It was a docu drama. It was a, I don't
do docu dramas. I hate that shit.

814
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,710
It was based on the Henry Lee Lucas.

815
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,100
Is this a weird drifter that randomly
killed people and confess to a shitload of

816
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:54,420
crime they never got, was
it the Green River killer?
They never got Zodiac killer.

817
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,450
So the actually they never, we never
got the Zodiac guy. Yeah. Yeah.

818
00:49:57,451 --> 00:50:02,280
They have a lot of different theories
on who that guy was from a mathematician

819
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:06,270
to, you know, various
high intellect people.

820
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,330
That's some creepy shit.
I mean,

821
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:10,120
what do you think the guy went to
prison when you think he's, yeah,

822
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,230
I don't know. They don't quit
right now. Most of them don't quit.

823
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:16,750
But who knows what makes
someone start ready go.

824
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,690
And who knows whether or not
they can ready stop. You know,

825
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:21,430
some people can stop
drinking and some people,

826
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:24,650
they don't need alcoholics anonymous.
Some people quit heroin. You know?

827
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,130
I don't know. Maybe. So I've always wanted
real killer. I've always wondered that

828
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,720
if you were going to do,

829
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,740
and it's been a fucking plot
on a million television shows,

830
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:38,000
but it's the idea that, okay, if you're
going to off somebody for whatever reason,

831
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,100
if you make them fourth
in a series of six, yeah.

832
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,710
All of a sudden now it's
not an assassination. Right.
It's a serial killing. Well,

833
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,620
the other thing they say
is that if it's random,

834
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:54,040
if you just pick random people who just
pull into a gas station, you know, go up,

835
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,850
hey, can I get a pack of gum? Boom.

836
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,230
There's that where it's
almost impossible to solve.

837
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,210
It's crazy. Like if you look at unsolved
and like certain cities like Chicago,

838
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,040
DC,
other things,

839
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:10,940
it's like 70% unsolved homicides.
Yeah,

840
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,270
because dude, I tell you
what, there's a fun Mas.

841
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,780
It's a phenomenal book.
You ought to read.

842
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,750
Did you ever watch the movie or you've
seen the wire television show? The why?

843
00:51:21,751 --> 00:51:25,370
I've only seen actually the first couple
of episodes. I never kept watching it.

844
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,840
I know I failed culturally. Dude,
I'm telling you I'm not and I don't,

845
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:33,350
I'm not saying that to be
a breaking bad hipster.

846
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,040
I'm not a breaking bad type
prick. Who Back to Madison? No,

847
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,210
I watched the first season. Fuck off.
You didn't like it. The wires. The wire,

848
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:44,450
it gives it the six. Both
of you can suck. Suck Dick.

849
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:49,240
Because I think that game of Thrones
can conquer all of them. What?

850
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,180
How hard is it to where everyone dies?
It doesn't matter. How hard is that?

851
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,010
Everyone dies.

852
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:58,670
Dragons come back next seasons we'll give
you new people to love so we can kill

853
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:03,050
them. How about zombies? Do
you like a walking dead? Not
so much area. Not so much.

854
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:06,710
Yeah, it's decent. But what, okay,

855
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:11,630
here's your question on zombies. As long
as you're doing zombies. Loved the book,

856
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:15,320
World War Z. I thought it was fucking
amazing. Love that book. Interesting.

857
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:17,810
I thought it was kind of slow.
Really. I got it out there. Yeah.

858
00:52:17,811 --> 00:52:20,090
I thought the book was to
kind of slow. No Shit. Yeah.

859
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,540
What'd you think about the movie?
Well,

860
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,890
Brad Pitt is a beautiful man and a,

861
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,810
he's got an excellent symmetry and uh,
his wife,

862
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,400
I thought it was very tastefully chosen.

863
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:36,130
I thought it was interesting that
the violence was, uh, you know,

864
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,120
really like,
so sort of like non impactful,

865
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:41,661
you know,

866
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:45,890
it's like the coolest thing about the
whole fucking movie literally was the

867
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:50,250
Rangers at the airplane for, you
know, that was a check. No, no,

868
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:54,020
but the one no, but where the
dude was like, hey look, fuck you.

869
00:52:54,021 --> 00:52:57,620
We're going to get you to the plane.
Right. I hope it's worth it. Right.

870
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,790
That's legit, dude. That is legit as
is the fucking pyramid of zombies.

871
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:04,110
And they tried to cry. That was
gay. Climb up the wall of drawers.

872
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,610
That was fucking gay.
Have you ever

873
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,070
read the book? Uh, it's not violent.

874
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,120
28 days later was on bs.
Yeah,

875
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,480
that slow shambling never
ending on slot then World War z.

876
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:25,070
The book. Yeah. Yeah. That's what's
so fucking terrifying. And that's,

877
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,170
to me that was what made the book cool.
I disagree.

878
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,350
I prefer the 28 days
later sprinting Zombie.

879
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,810
That's my kind of Zombie new age,

880
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:38,811
French fucking Greek war
z book slash you know,

881
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:43,460
walking dead. Listen, I'll
fuck those zombies up. This
bitches are never catching.

882
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,340
But here's the thing, they
never get tired. Yeah, that's
true. They never give up.

883
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:50,440
But you can figure out a way to
get into a house. Shut my door,

884
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,400
take a nine or they never give up.
And that's all that door down.

885
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,740
That to me was a cool,
and don't get me wrong,

886
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:00,540
I think Max Brooks is
a self-important prick.

887
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,700
How dare you, I'm just telling
you first of all, how dare you.

888
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:05,160
You don't even know Max. I don't
know Max. But I've watched,

889
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:09,660
I've watched a lot of interviews with him
cause he, it Dick, in my opinion. Wow.

890
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,420
I could be wrong.
He might be the nicest guy in the world.

891
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,660
Might be tired of giving
interviews, could be, but you know,

892
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:17,970
he's Mel Brooks son till he
was rich before he started.

893
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,970
Also tired of people asking them about
his dad being Mel Brooks and how much of

894
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:23,610
an impact that has on his career.
And it might be fine, but hey,

895
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,090
if the checks were all good, I'll be nice
to you. You know who Joe Hill is? No,

896
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,630
he's Stephen King's son,
but he changed his name to Joe Hill,

897
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,060
so I didn't ride on the coattails of
Stephen King, smarmy, amazing author,

898
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,980
great author. Really, really good stuff.
And by the way, same genre. Stephen King,

899
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:43,290
horror movies, hard books.
Great, great, great stuff.
That's cool. I didn't know that.

900
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,720
Yeah, he's, he's really interesting.
One of my favorite authors and he,

901
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:50,730
Stephen King's son. It's incredible.
But he's Joe Hill, you know,

902
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:53,190
and I think he's got his own
following the smart move.

903
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:58,190
You know when your back's Brooks
Brooks, Mel Brooks, Mel Brooks Son,

904
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,260
Jim, Mel Brooks son. Look
at you. You have grown up.

905
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:05,460
I've known you since you were
a little boy. Oh my goodness.

906
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:07,830
Mel Brooks son is here. Honey, come here.

907
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:12,810
But like every interview I've seen when
that dude, like I'm a big book TV freak,

908
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,680
you know, span all that bullshit. I
watch all that stuff. 28 days later.

909
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:21,420
Zombies role. Yes. Especially
when you look at the production
of that, that movie,

910
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,980
how they did that 20 days
later, it's sick. They run,
they gave him like fucking,

911
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,850
they made that movie with like $88
and a fucking credit card. Yeah.

912
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:32,310
They just shut down in London for a day
and they got their major shot and that

913
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:35,880
was it. Yeah, that's it. Everything
else was filmed on an iPhone.

914
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,330
I think just fucking guys are gangster.
I think 28 days later,

915
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:43,530
zombies and this carriers, the ones
that run rage virus absolute on there.

916
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:48,810
They're freaky. But at the same time,
like a, I read a book how Steve,

917
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:52,830
not Steven Pressfield, um, I
can't think of that guy's name,

918
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:58,110
but he makes a, an interesting argument
that if you look at zombies like locusts,

919
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,970
imagine now millions of them.
Think about this now.

920
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:07,650
If you have a life form that I can't
believe we're getting this diva in the

921
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:11,670
fucking zombies with deep and Zam. But
think about it. Okay, New York City,

922
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,020
perfect example. 7 million people
in New York City right now,

923
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,710
they all turned a zombies.
They don't die, you know,

924
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,140
so they gotta go somewhere and
they're going to search out food.

925
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:24,100
The one instinct they is go to food.
Where are you gonna

926
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,240
go?
You're gonna go north.

927
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:28,420
We're going to go south if you can
get off the fucking island. So anyway,

928
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:32,290
so now you come south,
say they come south.

929
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,730
Now they come through all the east coast,
Philadelphia, Virginia, all the bullshit.

930
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,400
They come around the Alleghenies.
Where are they gonna go?

931
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:42,850
They're going to go west. And as they
come, they keep picking people up.

932
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,260
Perfect examples. You look at the locus,
the great locust plagues, you know,

933
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:49,450
do the locust starved to death?
No,

934
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:53,950
because they go to the next fucking field
to keep going. So now imagine this. Yes,

935
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:56,950
you can be the biggest bad ass in the
world with all the fucking weapons you

936
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:57,784
want,

937
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:02,950
but now you're overran with millions
of something. No matter what it is.

938
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,920
Imagine was millions of rats.
Fuck zombies.

939
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,750
But I mean millions of anything. It's
just fucked. Fuck Bro. It's scary.

940
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:16,060
Scary. That was what, that was
the cool part about Max Brooks,

941
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:20,830
his book is that he got that
across was he got across that,

942
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,990
that feeling of humanity,
you know, even if you,

943
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:29,980
when you almost lose
because you can kill them,

944
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:34,730
but every time you lose a person,
it's a win for the enemy. Right.

945
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:37,750
It's not the fact that you lost one.

946
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,870
It's the fact that you lost
one and they gained one. Right.

947
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:46,320
So you do that times 100,000 that's
a 200,000 it's like gambling.

948
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,540
It's a 200,000 swing.
You know,

949
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:53,510
you're down a hundred they're up a
hundred right, right, right. So, but,

950
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:57,490
but that idea of that
relentless never ending,

951
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,190
just constant,
you know,

952
00:58:00,191 --> 00:58:03,610
to me that is a different
feeling in that fiction world.

953
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:06,760
Of course then the whole rates
not be thing. Yeah. The range.

954
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:10,780
The range thing is scarier on film because
it's like motherfuckers flipping out

955
00:58:10,781 --> 00:58:14,860
at you from nowhere,
but it's that shambling never ending,

956
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,490
you know? Okay, you want to
kill a 5,000 of us? Okay.

957
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,360
Eventually your rifle barrels going to
wear out before we do kills many as you

958
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:25,684
want.

959
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,760
I feel like the outlaw Josey Wales with
a Gatling gun from 1865 said good to de

960
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,560
de de, De, De, De, de, De de digit,
digit out of the back of a wagon.

961
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:36,890
Arrows wouldn't melt,
bro.

962
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,310
It'd be barrels wouldn't melt or you
would just go inside and take on.

963
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,060
Speaking of which, speaking of which, if,

964
00:58:44,061 --> 00:58:49,061
if that's not one of the best
movies ever in history of life,

965
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,680
I'm going to send these boys
on a Missouri a boat ride.

966
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,080
Joey ideas is probably
seen that movie 300 times.

967
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,260
Fucking Judaism will call me up.
Have you ever seen the movie

968
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:01,590
Jeremiah Johnson?
Yes.

969
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,510
I just turned it. I just turned
our buddy Austin on in that movie.

970
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:10,740
There's something about those, the
movies from that era, you know that were,

971
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:15,810
that was my point. Amazing. That was my
original point. The God damn man. Shit.

972
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:18,090
Look at the movies we're
talking about Jeremiah Johnson,

973
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,680
butch Cassidy and the Sundance
kid. I mean, when they're booking,

974
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:26,030
jump off bandit son. I mean the
band is very manly, but when,

975
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:29,360
when butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid
or brought the jump off that cliff and

976
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:30,770
they're like, can you swim?
No, it doesn't matter.

977
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:33,040
The fall's going to probably
kill you anyway. Shot.

978
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,480
And the end of that motherfucker,

979
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,990
that's probably the coolest end of
any movie when those flash dance.

980
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,880
I'm not flashdance Guy Bro.

981
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:48,510
But I remember butch and Sundance when
they go out of that Shell girl have a,

982
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,550
other than showgirls,

983
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:53,330
the only thing I remember about showgirls
is when she got the guy off through

984
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:57,230
his pants. Hmm. Interesting.
I remember this.

985
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,380
Why are you crazy?
The fall will probably kill you.

986
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,290
How fucking gangsters that,

987
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:11,740
yeah.

988
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,560
Redford and Newman and
they're fucking prime.

989
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,553
Oh,

990
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,340
oh

991
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,613
yeah.

992
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:30,340
Wow. Dude, that's got nothing on Jeremiah
Johnson. I just watched it. And the end,

993
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,270
there was a sequence in Jeremiah Johnson,

994
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:37,380
Robert Redford in the fucking
Rockies in Utah before he bought, uh,

995
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,470
the Sundance Park city thing.

996
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:45,290
And the way that movie got made was
the director, uh, what's his name?

997
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,180
Sydney Pollack.

998
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:51,470
I think Sydney Pollack put up his fucking
house to borrow the money to make the,

999
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,530
to make the movie because they ran out
of money because the locations were so

1000
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:58,190
expensive.
It's a great story,

1001
01:00:58,191 --> 01:01:00,440
but what if he found a rich guy
and sucked his dick for the money?

1002
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:03,410
It wouldn't be as good as story. It could
be possible. You know what I'm saying?

1003
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:07,160
Like people make sacrifices. I don't
think you'll respect certain sacrifices,

1004
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,590
but he's like Sydney Pollack,
Sean,

1005
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,210
this rich guy and sucked his
dick and got $100 million.

1006
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,720
What would depend on how good the movie
is depending on how good you think about

1007
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:15,441
it,
it's now think about,

1008
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:18,660
think it would depend on how good a
mood [inaudible] skills are. Tariff,

1009
01:01:18,661 --> 01:01:22,940
he made Jeremiah Johnson,
I'll be like, hey, fuck it.

1010
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:27,260
I respect that. I respect the
commitment. If you made, I dunno,

1011
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,930
I would be like,
he's a fool.

1012
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:33,710
I hope that load was weak.

1013
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,150
I hope it was a very like the third load
of the day to where it was just like

1014
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:42,650
dust. It was just a confusing
dust to where I was like,
you know, it didn't even,

1015
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:46,410
it didn't even go from hard to soft.
It was just kind of me. Yeah. You know,

1016
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,950
just halfway there. Yeah. It
was like a fucking cookie low.

1017
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,160
There's nothing violent or as passionate
about it. And I just like, ah, fuck,

1018
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,810
look at that picture.
The producers like God,

1019
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,410
it and another one frozen dudes
are scary. Yeah. Hashi Jack,

1020
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,230
that's Hatchet Jack.

1021
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:04,370
The scariest shit to me is when the show
those photographs of guys who tried to

1022
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:08,210
climb Everest and failed and
they find their bodies face down.

1023
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,880
Like the first guy that airs
mother named Everest Sisters.

1024
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,940
Motherfuckers on Everest been
there forever and we'll be there.

1025
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:17,670
The first guy to climb Mount Everest
is there. There will be there. Yeah.

1026
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,010
That was actually,
that was actually one of my,

1027
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,060
a little fucking, uh,
what was I saying? Uh,

1028
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,600
what's the word I'm looking
for? Goddammit. The, uh,

1029
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,850
examples of manhood? No.
Um, niche. Like a niche.

1030
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:38,280
It's a niche or niche. No, the, a
subculture goddamn culture subculture,

1031
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:42,660
which is that the Himalayan
over 8,000 meter climbers,

1032
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,880
but I mean, frozen to the ground, they
leave them up there. There's hundreds of,

1033
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:50,700
yeah, but the fucked up thing
about ever since, it's basically,

1034
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:53,190
it's like Disneyland. Yeah.
It's a fucking tourist park.

1035
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,980
You could go climb Everest next
year if you want it to. I mean, you,

1036
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:00,000
you pay a guy 15 grand, you roll
up there, they give you your shit,

1037
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:02,910
and if you make it, you make it. And if
not, fuck it. They send you back down.

1038
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:07,260
Keep your money.
The freaky shit is fucking Kaytoo.

1039
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:11,940
That's worse. K Two is like the
killer just mountain in the world.

1040
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:16,800
There's an article from 2012 where
they're trying to reclaim the dead,

1041
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:22,650
uh, from Everest. This is,
this is pretty interesting. Uh,

1042
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,680
if you read what's Ed
Viesturs, v I, e. S t,

1043
01:03:26,681 --> 01:03:28,540
U. R. S. Edvestors.

1044
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,290
There's like seven or eight guys who
have climbed every mountain over 8,000

1045
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,360
meters. I, there's 14 of them,

1046
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:38,950
14 mountains in the world that
are higher than 14,000 meters.

1047
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:44,380
There's seven or eight guys.
You've climbed them. All.
Ed Features is an American.

1048
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,280
He's climbed them all without oxygen.
He's climbing phrases.

1049
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:51,550
It's a fucking gangster.
Some Seattle area,

1050
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:57,100
but a shadow area. Seattle.
Oh, did I say West Coast?

1051
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,630
West Coast.
I was like,

1052
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:01,870
is this more soldier fortunate
time to talk West Coast Seattle.

1053
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,180
Um,
but

1054
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,920
do you know why? Because when you live
in Seattle, it rains all the time easily.

1055
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,830
You have a willing to risk your life
for shit. I think it was ray near,

1056
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:15,910
but he's got an interesting uh,
yeah, right there. That's him.

1057
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:18,540
Okay.

1058
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,470
What's crazy is he talks about
the, I've got, I've read that book.

1059
01:04:22,471 --> 01:04:24,780
That's a great book.
But what he talks about is like,

1060
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:29,580
there was a couple of clients he was on
where he turned back and he got like the

1061
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:33,390
first time I think he was on
Everest is Everest or k two.

1062
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:38,580
He was like six or 700 meters from the
top and he turned around and he said,

1063
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:43,110
you know, because you know if you
don't come down alive it doesn't count.

1064
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,070
Right. And that's part of, that's
what gets a lot of guys killed. Right?

1065
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,040
They just need to pull it off.
Exactly.

1066
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:55,041
They get within that thousand meters
and a lot of guys will set a turnaround

1067
01:04:56,431 --> 01:05:00,960
times to where they have,
like if it's a drop dead time,

1068
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:06,410
if you're not on the summit by two o'clock
if you're one fucking foot from it,

1069
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,073
you'd come back

1070
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:14,260
because you have to build in time for
shit to go wrong. Right. And if you don't,

1071
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:17,710
you die. A lot of guys die. How many guys
have jerked off on the top of Everest?

1072
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:17,980
I want to

1073
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,620
be the first you think anybody ever
has, I dunno. I'd like to be numero uno.

1074
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:27,000
15 grand. You'd give it a shot, that's
all. Yeah. What I get out of it.

1075
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:29,900
You think how much you can take a phone?

1076
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,820
What would you jack off to?
You'd be like,

1077
01:05:34,821 --> 01:05:37,640
you have to have to fund the next round.
What are all those bodies?

1078
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:41,840
That's the line of people they ever
go up. Yes. Oh, that's ridiculous.

1079
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:46,440
It's okay to say now. It is.
Exactly. That's insane. It is. This,

1080
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:48,740
this thing we're looking at
is like a line at Disneyland.

1081
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:53,800
It is like a line of defense is different
in the fact that there's been three.

1082
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,970
I mean there's been a lot
of years when no one's home.

1083
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:01,040
Let's k two there are 200 between
200 and 233 bodies up on Everest.

1084
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:08,100
Google, k to see how many, see how
many people summited k two this year.

1085
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,160
I'm fascinated by goals like that and
the goals of climbing all the mountains,

1086
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:16,390
all the over 30,000 mountain
right now I'm, I'm, I'm,

1087
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,010
I'm absolutely fascinated by like goals,

1088
01:06:20,011 --> 01:06:23,280
like these big lofty goals and only
a few people have ever achieved.

1089
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,090
One of them is a, the you, you
know what the Super Slam is?

1090
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,400
The Super Slam is a for big game hunters.
Yeah.

1091
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,600
Lion.
It's an elephant.

1092
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,420
Everything in North America,
North America, the North
American gay male animals,

1093
01:06:38,421 --> 01:06:42,200
the Super Slam. It's a sheep, Brown
bear, black bear. Grizzly bear,

1094
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:43,880
polar bear by Brown bear,

1095
01:06:43,881 --> 01:06:48,400
Alaska Bear Brown bear and Grizzly
bear or the same thing, right?

1096
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:51,350
Same thing. Yeah. So this, this
might have been established.

1097
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:56,200
It might be that their treat
they take methylate bag.

1098
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,870
Yes. Yes. Canada, the um,

1099
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:03,380
North America Brown bear and Grizzly
bear according to Steve or on the

1100
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:03,951
differences,

1101
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:07,670
the grizzlies inland and the brown bears
on the coast and the ground brown bears

1102
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:11,990
actually grow larger, much too
popular or much to a, the what?

1103
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:16,760
Most people don't. They're all
mean as fuck rounders in general.

1104
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:20,150
Brown bears just get my protein.
They're getting salmon on a regular basis.

1105
01:07:20,151 --> 01:07:24,950
Mass Black Bears Sandman Caribou,
Moose, they get everything. The,

1106
01:07:24,951 --> 01:07:29,810
the massive amounts of salmon. They get
fucking tremendous. Um, grisly polar bear.

1107
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,160
And then with cats, it's a cougar and
they might even add Jaguar. You know,

1108
01:07:34,161 --> 01:07:37,460
there is a real issue off American cars.
No North America,

1109
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:40,900
the fuck out of the are entering
through Mexico into north

1110
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:44,040
illegal fucking cats, bro. Hey,

1111
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:48,720
the illegal cast blame fucking same
roads that drug dealers, a trans,

1112
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,120
this crisis or problem.
You know what?

1113
01:07:50,121 --> 01:07:52,910
There probably is fucking
strapping cocaine to these jaguars,

1114
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,890
right in their assholes,
right in their assets.

1115
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,310
And how much you would pay for the
coastline, Jaguar of an asshole.

1116
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:04,610
It would be worth so much more than
regular coke. Wait. Yeah man, it's cold.

1117
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:06,460
Came through. It came from a
drug, will talk to the dude.

1118
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:10,310
Stop this cocaine came out with
Jaguars asshole. This is the Jaguar.

1119
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:14,630
It's caught on a trail cam duct tape
on his ass water to gram 200 grants.

1120
01:08:14,631 --> 01:08:15,464
I'm real.

1121
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,490
They're starting to find them in a,
especially in New Mexico and Arizona,

1122
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:23,090
they're starting to find jaguars that
have made their way from, uh, from Mexico.

1123
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,180
Big fucking cats.
200 plus pounds.

1124
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:28,490
I don't think Jaguar's got that day.

1125
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:31,820
I thought Jaguars were like house like
bobcat's and go, oh no, no, no, no.

1126
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:34,740
Jaguars are enormous. They're much
bigger than mount lines. 50 pounds.

1127
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:40,150
I'm outlines a fucking cougar,
bro. Yeah. Jaguars a bigger shit.

1128
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,940
If I could have any pet on earth and not
have it kill me, it would be a cougar.

1129
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:48,650
Apparently pound for pound. Jaguars are
the most powerful cats. Really. Yeah,

1130
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:52,040
they're really fun. They're like
drag chute up and trees. Right.

1131
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:55,640
Like kill it and drag it up in the
tree. Crocodiles, get out of here.

1132
01:08:55,700 --> 01:09:00,590
Do you ever see a Jaguar go after Crongo
pull up Jaguars, jaguars, Black Panther,

1133
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:01,070
right.

1134
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:05,660
They sometimes are black but most of the
time they are blonde with black spots.

1135
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:08,300
But sometimes the spots cover their
entire body and they become black.

1136
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:12,620
It was just a genetic predisposition
or a, you know, a genetic choice.

1137
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:17,380
Just like some dogs are black, some dogs
are white. Yeah. That's how it is. And uh,

1138
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,940
the black ones are the
fucking scariest shit ever.

1139
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:23,750
And the jungle of the Amazon called
panthers, right. They are the same thing.

1140
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:27,600
So I would have Florida Panther
cancer is a Puma is a mountain lion.

1141
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:32,420
A Jaguar is a larger cat.
So fucking animal. Yeah,

1142
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:36,110
they're spotted there. Spotted. But the
black ones, look at this mother fucker.

1143
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,470
That's, that's Jaguar that said,
it's not bigger than a cougar bro.

1144
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:41,540
A hundred pound cat and my friend,
that's not a cougar.

1145
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,660
It's America's much no incorrect.

1146
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,110
That's a 200 pound Jaguar and that Jaguar,

1147
01:09:48,111 --> 01:09:52,700
it's going to matches up this fucking
crock of and bites it with one punch,

1148
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,440
one punch to the back of the head.

1149
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,940
These mother fuckers hunt
everything that lives,

1150
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:03,920
everything, anything that walks in the
ground. Occasionally this Jaguar eats,

1151
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,340
eats everything in the Amazon.
Look at this motherfucker.

1152
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:10,940
I'm making a run for this thing.
Making a run for a crocodile.

1153
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:15,650
What does the crocodile do? Panics. Well,
yeah. I mean what the fuck would you do?

1154
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:18,910
You don't know what would happen if you
ran out of crocodile. Nothing rocket.

1155
01:10:18,911 --> 01:10:22,860
I would open its mouth and eat. Thank
you. The crocodile sees this Jaguar.

1156
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:27,020
I was like, Oh fuck this shit
bitch. Look at this. This jag.

1157
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:31,310
Drag it out of the fucking
like eating a crocodile man.

1158
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,560
Do you understand the
significance of this?

1159
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,080
That's a crocodile he
killed with his face.

1160
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,850
He doesn't even fucking live in the water
cause you imagine how strong you would

1161
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:44,210
have to be. The carry something that
weighs as much as you do out of the water.

1162
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,900
Look at the look on his face.
Look how he's biting this
thing. Biting. I'm the Cha.

1163
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,860
Tired of your shit.
He's biting it through.

1164
01:10:49,861 --> 01:10:52,940
It's Shit I haven't eaten since Wednesday.
Yeah,

1165
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:56,600
and they also have the ability to pull
those things apart with your face.

1166
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:01,010
Look at the eyes and that motherfucker.
Cats have the most murderous, evil,

1167
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:04,870
soulless eyes. That's a legit murderers,
man. They're killers. Don't kill this.

1168
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:08,840
And it's in the water. This
house. Yeah. I have a sweetie,

1169
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:11,900
sweetie cat that I've had for 16 years.
She just killed a bird.

1170
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,100
The other killed a million
birds. You don't know about. Just

1171
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,250
killed one the other day. Right on a
fucking shrine underneath the couch.

1172
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:22,650
Look at this. It's a bird made out of
feathers. Biting on top of his skull.

1173
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:27,010
Right. Carrying around tears up. Shit.

1174
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:31,620
There's a whole series of Jaguars
like get them from the bottom.

1175
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,730
Just rips them apart. Slowly, but sure.

1176
01:11:33,731 --> 01:11:37,210
It's dead already now it's a matter
of just opening it up. The g,

1177
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,440
the Jaguar is so strong with his job.
He can a stone killers.

1178
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:43,380
Have you gotten any more hunting this
year? What's Word I'm going next month.

1179
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:46,950
Yeah. Yeah. We're going to a
Wisconsin, I'm going to go shoot some,

1180
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:51,210
some deer hollow,
and then when I come back and a late,

1181
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:55,620
late a winter, I'm going to go
shoot a buffalo in Texas. Woo.

1182
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,160
They just stand there. We ought to
go shoot hogs brought to meet runs.

1183
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:02,370
I got a guy in Texas has got a ranch.
Let's do it.

1184
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,950
She was telling me when I can hook
it up. Okay. It's done. I mean,

1185
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,320
it's nuisance game down there,
so it's just a matter of going down them.

1186
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,610
We've talked about it many times.
One of my favorite shows is pig man.

1187
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,210
Pick Dan's a show in the
sportsmans channel and uh,

1188
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:21,120
him and Ted Nugent shot hogs out of
a helicopter. That would be a heat.

1189
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:25,340
One time they killed two 15 a day.
The next time it was more than 400,

1190
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:28,530
250 more than 400. The
loud. You want to know.

1191
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:33,531
It's funny now I was talking to my buddy
gets the guy who knows a guy that in

1192
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,330
Texas, he's like, yeah man, we've
been talking about it forever.

1193
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:41,280
We're going to take like 50 pounds
of Tannerite. What's Tannerite.

1194
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,850
That sounds bad. You know, a Tannerite
is showing what tannerite is.

1195
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,680
Google Tanner writer, check this out.
Jesus Christ. So this is the, uh,

1196
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:52,410
what we were talking about. This is the
finished the Super Slam. These are the,

1197
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,070
these are the animals, Alaskan brown bear,
black bear, grizzly bear, polar bear,

1198
01:12:56,071 --> 01:13:00,960
Cougar, Columbia blacktail deer.
That's like $100,000 with a hunt.

1199
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,130
More than that. Cuzdey or mule deer, Sitka
deer, whitetail deer, rocky mountain,

1200
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:09,360
elk grove, my God. Stop Chill Elk.
Way more barren ground Caribou,

1201
01:13:09,361 --> 01:13:14,160
central Canadian barren ground,
Caribou, mountain Caribou,
Quebec, Labrador, Caribou,

1202
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:16,650
woodland Caribou, Alaska,
Yukon Moose, Canadian,

1203
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:21,330
Moose and Caribou to get bison Musk ox.

1204
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,860
A Musk ox is in north American
game. Animal style. Now
I've heard everything. Uh,

1205
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:27,000
American mountain goat,

1206
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:31,050
pronghorn and obvious outfitters or
making this California big sheep. Dall,

1207
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:34,290
sheep desert, big horn sheep, rocky
mountain bighorn sheep. Don't cheap.

1208
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,580
I'll Atlantic Walrus. These
are the auxiliary stop. Celia,

1209
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:42,090
Larry Animals,
auxiliary auxiliary.

1210
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:46,730
They get the Jaguars in there and
Pacific Walrus. That's all of them.

1211
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:50,480
Know who the fuck is going to shoot a
walrus. And here's where I draw the line.

1212
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:54,120
Who needs to share? Here's where
I draw a line, man. I, I'm not,

1213
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,310
I did hunting.
That's fine.

1214
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,050
I'm not a hunter because I don't have the
patience for it. Um, but I respect it.

1215
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:04,680
I understand that hunters pay for their
whole hunters are the whole fucking

1216
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:08,750
reason most of this shit. What
is this, right? Yes. Temperature.

1217
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:13,850
She walks right Tanner, right? This
is like, it's in a Bacardi bottle.

1218
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:18,520
Billy Express. Okay. And so I'm assuming
it's an explosive. Yes, it is. Okay.

1219
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:20,320
So this guy backs way up.
Yes.

1220
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:25,330
And detonates it Tannerite is a binary
explosive to where you put these two

1221
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:28,540
things together and then it's detonated.
It has to be,

1222
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:31,030
the only way it can be set off is by sea.

1223
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:36,190
It's completely fucking legal.
You can buy it in the mail,

1224
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:41,110
but it's a binary explosive. And the
fact that the only way it can be set,

1225
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,870
you can set fire to it.
You can sell electricity to it.

1226
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,210
You can fucking jump up and down on it.

1227
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:51,540
The only way that we'll get set off is
if it's penetrated by around going almost

1228
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:52,900
300 feet per second.

1229
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,100
So you have to hit it with a rifle
round and that will set it off.

1230
01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:00,040
But otherwise it's completely,
absolutely,

1231
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,900
it's illegal just because
people don't know about it.

1232
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,980
Like there was a psychedelic,

1233
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:08,860
sorta most powerful psychedelic drug
ever that was legal for the longest time.

1234
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:09,671
Really missed it.

1235
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:13,690
And the sweeping sites that like some
shit out of a human pituitary gland from a

1236
01:15:13,691 --> 01:15:17,080
fucking mail baby with
one eye. Similar, but no,

1237
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:21,820
it's called five methodoxy die
methyl trip to me and five methoxy

1238
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:25,750
dimethyltryptamine five meo dynamic felt
like a big stash of that Preben shit

1239
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:30,280
somewhere
you to meet if you want to meet,

1240
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,780
I can bring into Oden's chambers if
you truly want to meet him. Um, yeah,

1241
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:40,700
still doing that. Oh yeah, I got one of
my basement. Yeah. Yeah. Well I'll try it.

1242
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:44,510
Fuck No. That scare the shit. I be
scared. Oh, I'm telling you bro.

1243
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:47,660
Now this tank's doesn't slavery.
The tank is easy to faith.

1244
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:50,550
It's great on your body. Feels
good. It's relaxing. That's,

1245
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:55,280
you're into this whole fucking
self, you know, I know better.

1246
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:59,780
No better
have

1247
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:03,930
no desire to get up in that
fucking mess. Well, um, the, uh,

1248
01:16:03,931 --> 01:16:08,931
the tank thing for me that's a big part
of like every day is a big part of life.

1249
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:12,360
No Shit. Big Part of thinking. Yeah.
The tank is where I sorted. Right.

1250
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:16,890
Sorted it all out. How often do you use
it? What's in my basement? So, well,

1251
01:16:16,891 --> 01:16:20,310
I've got a lot of shit in my
fucking within arms reach.

1252
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,970
Last time I used it was two
days ago. Yeah. That's great.

1253
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:28,710
How long do you use it for? A few hours.
I like to go on fat loss that time.

1254
01:16:28,711 --> 01:16:32,190
The time to were freaked out. If
you ever been like, fuck this. Fuck,

1255
01:16:32,191 --> 01:16:33,420
how do I get out? No, no, no.

1256
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:37,080
Every freak out that I've ever had has
been a good one. I've learned from them.

1257
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:40,020
Every freak out that I've ever had, I'd
be like, well, what was bothering me?

1258
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:42,510
What was the free, why was I freaking
out? Yeah. What was the freak out about?

1259
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:45,810
What weakness was, you know,
was exposed by that freak out.

1260
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,870
What a in balance with what
thing that I don't like.

1261
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,640
I mean were you're able to do
that in the tank or, yeah. Yeah.

1262
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,710
You got a little carried away
and then you backed off or what?

1263
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:58,590
It's all about breathing and perspective.

1264
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:01,680
It's all about keeping your breathing
under control. Don't let panic breaths.

1265
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:06,360
Like the big thing about psychedelic
trips that happened with a lot of people,

1266
01:17:06,361 --> 01:17:10,460
whether they're naturally occurring
psychedelic trips, like a tank, meditation

1267
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,450
or drugs.

1268
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:16,130
The big thing is you trying to control
what's happening and when you try to

1269
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:19,850
control what's happening, it's just
you can't control a bitch. Good luck.

1270
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:24,790
It's like going down a river, you
know, like some crazy fucking,

1271
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,070
what is that airplane? Is that an
airplane vacuum? Why this awhile?

1272
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:35,450
What do they vacuum? I think
it's an airplane with a
vacuum on it and I say, Bro,

1273
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:38,620
you're, if you're going down a
river and you know your, your,

1274
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:43,330
your body's flailing and flailing around
like, and you try to like control it,

1275
01:17:43,331 --> 01:17:44,800
you can't control it.
You know,

1276
01:17:44,801 --> 01:17:47,840
if you're bouncing off rocks and shit
and you're completely out of control in

1277
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:49,180
the white waters,
you can't control it.

1278
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:54,340
The difference between that
and a psychedelic trip is
it the psychedelic trip is

1279
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:55,720
actually not going to kill you.

1280
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:59,710
Whereas the the out of control feeling
that you have in a river, there's,

1281
01:17:59,711 --> 01:18:01,600
it's inevitable. Like you, you,

1282
01:18:01,601 --> 01:18:04,600
you may get lucky and grab
a branch on the way down,

1283
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:07,690
but you may also go off the
waterfall and die. Sure.

1284
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,900
The difference between that and
the psychedelic experiences,

1285
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:13,180
there's nothing to worry about
and the psychedelic experience,

1286
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:17,380
but it's just as much out of your control
so you have to be able to let go and

1287
01:18:17,381 --> 01:18:19,120
it's very, very, very, very,

1288
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:22,840
very hard for people to do because you
have to let go of all your perceptions

1289
01:18:22,841 --> 01:18:25,540
about who you are,
how you interface with the world,

1290
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,420
what your environment means to you.

1291
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,300
The, the, the, the, the, the,
the, the circle. I mean, you know,

1292
01:18:31,301 --> 01:18:32,770
all this shit going in though,
right?

1293
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:37,080
I learned all this shit going in
and I still don't know I could,

1294
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:40,780
I could freak out. Well, what happened
if you just stuck someone in there

1295
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:45,580
like you stuck someone in there.
It depends entirely on who that person,

1296
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:47,190
if they weren't prepared,
if they just,

1297
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,930
it's like if you fucking
threw a hood on them. Yeah,

1298
01:18:49,931 --> 01:18:51,460
if you just threw a fucking hold on him,

1299
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:55,360
snatched him off the street and they
woke up in the tank, the tank is,

1300
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:57,400
well that would be weird.
That'd be like torture.

1301
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,790
Well no, it wouldn't be tortured
cause you would move around.

1302
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:02,920
You would feel the water. You, you can't,
it's not like your body doesn't move.

1303
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,470
The beautiful thing about this,
the

1304
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:09,150
tank is basically, you've got
your own Guantanamo Bay in
your basement. No, no, no.

1305
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:13,470
That's way nicer than that.
It's, there's no music blaring.

1306
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,880
No fucking dogs.
Crazy ass holes.

1307
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:19,560
And trying to fucking get you to talk
about your time as a student in Pakistan.

1308
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:24,390
There's none of that. The, the,
the tank zero, dark 30. Yes. Yeah,

1309
01:19:24,391 --> 01:19:26,100
I know you didn't like it because you're,
you know,

1310
01:19:26,101 --> 01:19:30,390
you're up on what all the hell that shit
you're fucked up by this suspension of

1311
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,160
disbelief, you know. But I gotta tell Ya,

1312
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:37,020
the dude who was doing the
questioning was freaky. He was scary.

1313
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:40,230
He was scary because he was so
calm. Yeah. Well that's really,

1314
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:42,090
look how those guys get.
They get very clinical.

1315
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,000
It was I looking at you lie
to me, I'm going to hurt
you. Yeah. And then with the,

1316
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,080
with the fucking,

1317
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:50,400
something else I heard that I had never
heard before was they were sticking them.

1318
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,800
My thing, dude, bugs, bugs.
Even worse fucking spiders.

1319
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:00,660
Yeah. I mean, you know,
I'll fight Ya. Okay, fine.

1320
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:03,360
But you put a fucking big
ass spider right here.

1321
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:07,740
I'll scream like a bitch or I'll flip
this fucking table trying to kill it.

1322
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:11,520
One or the other. But fucking
spiders. I hate spiders.

1323
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:12,960
But that was one of the things,

1324
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:16,560
I guess they played on the phobia as a
motherfuckers was they would stick them

1325
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:20,700
in these fucking boxes filled with all
kinds of bugs and fear factor. Yeah,

1326
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:24,840
exactly. Exactly. That was one of the
reasons why I never watched fear factor.

1327
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:29,880
Seriously. The bugs and the spiders
and the bullshit. And I always thought,

1328
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:34,890
you know, like eating, you know, donkey
balls and all that bullshit. I was like,

1329
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:39,330
I never could understand it because
it's like, what did they win 50 grand?

1330
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,660
If they win, you have to make
it to the final. So sweet.

1331
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:46,230
I looked back then and then they play
and then they play fucking taxes on it.

1332
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:51,030
So they make what? 33 34
yeah, 34 thousands. Um,

1333
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,060
fuck you.
But that's not even fair brow.

1334
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,870
Some people did it and they did it as
nice in fair. Let me tell you something.

1335
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:00,540
I guess I'm watching that. I eat one
of those for free. Stop it. Yeah,

1336
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:03,630
me and Michael. Yo, there was
a TV show. It was one of those,

1337
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:08,300
what was that like that? Well, Michael
Yoh was one that was a, um, uh,

1338
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,400
African cave dwelling spider and he,
me and Michael,

1339
01:21:11,401 --> 01:21:15,810
we were doing a promo for the new series
of fear factor when it came back. And,

1340
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:19,890
uh, we both, uh, ate them. It
was nothing. I ate it, it was
nothing. It was just chewy.

1341
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,200
It was nothing.
Believe me,

1342
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:27,240
if you gave me the option between that
and a ton of other shit that I've done in

1343
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:29,070
my life,
I would take that all day.

1344
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:32,790
I need to have right in front of you right
now. It's nothing. It's like a logical,

1345
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:36,900
it is psychologic and that's what's crazy.
It's just like it's all psychological.

1346
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,220
Yeah, totally. I agree. I
don't give a fuck though. The
well, that's like the tank.

1347
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:44,850
What's scary about the idea of
the tank is only psychological.

1348
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:47,970
There's no tigers in there.
There's a Jaguar tank.

1349
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:51,860
Doesn't seem like it would
freak me the fuck out. Well,
you just said it would. No,

1350
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:52,531
no,
I was saying it.

1351
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:56,370
It could like if you took somebody and
through the metal know personally me. No,

1352
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:58,770
I don't think it would. It's great.
You would love it. Personally,

1353
01:21:58,771 --> 01:22:03,220
I don't think it would. I
mean for one thing it's like
I like being by myself. No,

1354
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,780
no, don't get me wrong. But I like,
I spend a lot of time reading.

1355
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:09,090
I'm not one of those people that,
you know,

1356
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:13,050
if I don't have inner social interaction
every hour, I flipped the fuck out.

1357
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:17,850
You know, I mean me and Michael Yo where
eating these k kicked willing spiders.

1358
01:22:17,851 --> 01:22:19,800
Michael. Yeah. Michael. Yeah, he's uh,

1359
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:23,430
he's like an entertainment journalist
and he was actually on fear factor back

1360
01:22:23,431 --> 01:22:28,350
way back in the day. Like episode one,
the first shows I just pick it up,

1361
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,390
pick it up and then might
in some blue cheese.

1362
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:34,860
That's the thing I got so used to
like people eating bugs and I got cha,

1363
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,810
I eat a bunch of shit. I eat a fucking
Matt just on the set and you're like,

1364
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:44,550
just saw a roach and you were like, no,
no, like an Asian girl. Just pick it up.

1365
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:49,260
I'm not stupid. They had catering.
They had really no need to do it.

1366
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:52,560
But it wasn't that it was something
I wanted to do, but it's easy to do.

1367
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:55,620
It's really not that big a deal. So I
give it to him. I'm holding onto too.

1368
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:59,730
I hand him one and he had the hardest
time grabbing it, man. He was,

1369
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,500
I don't know if he was
playing it up for the camera,

1370
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:04,650
but he really seemed to have
a heart. Very, very nice guy.

1371
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:09,220
But you know what the thing is though, I
was so desensitized. I was so used to it.

1372
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,570
Yeah. This doesn't even
interest me. Jesus.

1373
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,560
Yeah,
I would telling him do it.

1374
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:26,580
Can, oh, spiders bite. Oh yeah. Get the
fuck Outta here. What does this nun,

1375
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:35,180
who the fuck's filming this on us? Camera
phones. I don't know. Some of the phone.

1376
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:40,450
I told him if we lived in caveman times,
just that's being,

1377
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:45,380
I'm, I'm going to say I hope I would. I
would hope I'm not that big of a bitch.

1378
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,460
I would hope I would reach out. Crush
your hand, kill the spider and walk away.

1379
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:53,570
It's nothing. You would just take it.
You just take it. You, you'd have,

1380
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,720
it would have to be minimum.

1381
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,580
We'd have to be talking new car. Money
for free. Well that's cause you're crazy.

1382
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:09,000
No, I'm not looking at you. He evidently
didn't enjoy it. I just eaten it.

1383
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,880
That's him. That's him. I'm sorry.

1384
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:15,080
He's freaking out while Joe's over there
like popcorn, like apps more. My bad.

1385
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,510
Yeah. I'm like, well no. For
me to do some shit like that.

1386
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:20,960
We're talking minimum 30 Jesus had
a diet coke waiting on standby.

1387
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:24,920
Minimum Minimum 30,000 you
the fucking spiders. Nothing.

1388
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:28,710
It's not even worth 100 bucks. Yeah. Whoa.
Easy to just what I'm saying. I mean,

1389
01:24:28,711 --> 01:24:30,140
you know,
my price is my price,

1390
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:33,820
but I'm just saying that it's all based
on personal. Sure. Absolutely. You know,

1391
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,590
if you ever had someone choke you
choke you like almost unconscious.

1392
01:24:36,591 --> 01:24:38,810
We have to tap out. No, that's way worse.

1393
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:42,170
I believe I have that happen all the time.

1394
01:24:42,171 --> 01:24:46,430
I've done that to people but never got
me a bug is it ain't shit. You know?

1395
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:51,200
Oh, a young gal give you enthusiastic
but yet horrible blowjob. Yes.

1396
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:55,250
That's no fun. It's way better to
eat a bug. Disagree. Check out these.

1397
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:59,090
He's can't grow. Jobs are like
pizza. You know there's bad pizza,

1398
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,030
but need to get someone to suck your Dick.
That really has malice in their mind.

1399
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,900
Share these Kangaroos.
Beating the fuck out of each other.

1400
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:07,730
This is a video that someone sent me.

1401
01:25:07,731 --> 01:25:11,820
Apparently this ends with a
rear naked choke people. Yeah.

1402
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:15,320
People didn't send it to me all
day on Twitter. So out of respect,

1403
01:25:15,321 --> 01:25:18,830
I got to throw it up there.
But sweat how these fucking things fight.

1404
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,690
They go back on their tail,

1405
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:25,460
they use their tail to hold themselves
up to kick kick with their back legs and

1406
01:25:25,461 --> 01:25:29,990
they fucking do get out for like 10
minutes. Man. Do they take round breaks?

1407
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,810
No, they just keep fucking
each other up. Look at that.

1408
01:25:32,811 --> 01:25:35,660
That's like a fucking 120 pound rat.
Yeah.

1409
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,120
Well they get really big apparently.

1410
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,390
Apparently it's two
different types of Kangaroos.

1411
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,120
I think there's a gray
kangaroo and a red kangaroo.

1412
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:47,990
Our Buddy Eddie if spends a lot of time
and arch Barker's team spends all the

1413
01:25:47,991 --> 01:25:52,520
time as well in Australia and
some of them are really big,

1414
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:55,310
like six feet plus. Well
there's another, uh,

1415
01:25:55,340 --> 01:26:00,170
I guess donkeys in Australia are feral.
Like pigs are here.

1416
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:02,040
I guess I have a lot of trouble with,

1417
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:06,290
at least they did at time with
donkeys and Kangaroos. Wow.

1418
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:11,270
So there's a guy, his name's Jd
Jones. This is a gun thing, but um,

1419
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:15,470
he's known for a handgun hunter.
He's one of the bigger handgun hunters.

1420
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:20,210
He made a bunch of custom calibers
and all kinds of shit. But anyway,

1421
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,650
he used to organize what's called
a Australia environment hunt.

1422
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:29,580
Look at this fucking scramble and these
guys would go down and Doris please this,

1423
01:26:29,581 --> 01:26:34,380
this one. Kangaroos on top. Keeps
winning. Go Guard. Pull guard,

1424
01:26:34,381 --> 01:26:37,470
pull guard, Bro. It's the blonde,
the bonds of bitch. Oh Shit.

1425
01:26:37,471 --> 01:26:41,210
He's got this book and he's got the
hugs. The chuck. No hooks. He's gone.

1426
01:26:41,211 --> 01:26:44,730
Marcella Garcia style
concentrated firesides. I joke.

1427
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:47,590
Well Marcello concentrates
in Thailand and shit.

1428
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:52,580
He doesn't even worry about the hooks
is like, dude, I'll watch my UFC shows.

1429
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:55,710
Incredible. This is
incredible. This is a battle.

1430
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:57,190
Okay,

1431
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:00,940
stop. This is crazy, right?
It's got a good grip.

1432
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:06,140
It looks like he's got a gable
grip. Wow. He put them to sleep.

1433
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:08,360
Tapped him. Fuck you. He just tapped him.

1434
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:12,170
He let him go and he's just like hovering
with his balls over that Kangaroos

1435
01:27:12,171 --> 01:27:15,290
face. Wake up and go buy me a
Starbucks is asleep. He choked up.

1436
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:18,320
Motherfucker to sleep. Correct.
Not a choked him to death.

1437
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,840
Wake up and wants me to fuck your wife.
Let's see if he wakes up.

1438
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:24,380
He doesn't have a wife fitting.
Get married, Kangaroos, whatever.

1439
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:26,510
The kangaroos on the bottom,
licking his balls. See,

1440
01:27:26,511 --> 01:27:29,720
they looked up and he saw his balls.
Kangaroo still pass the fuck out.

1441
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:33,800
Look over on the left. Well he,
he just laying there. He's uh,

1442
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:38,480
he's submissive and this one's walking
away nice and slowly on his tail.

1443
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,690
He's hurt. That tail is legit. Yeah.

1444
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:44,870
Well I think they duked
it out for a long part of,

1445
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:48,680
for a long period of time before he
eventually got the rear naked choke.

1446
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:53,470
So the big ones, um, that are
the red kangaroos and the,

1447
01:27:53,471 --> 01:27:56,500
the Red Kangaroos is the
largest of all kangaroos.

1448
01:27:56,510 --> 01:28:01,510
The largest mammal to live in Australia
and the largest angle marsupial.

1449
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:07,060
And it's found in mainland
Australia avoiding only the
more fertile areas in the

1450
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:12,050
south east coast and the northern
rain forest. They're like, fuck you.

1451
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:15,810
We don't want your water. We don't want
your fertility. The biggest they get, um,

1452
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:20,980
head to body length is 5.2 feet and
then the tail and the legs and all that

1453
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:22,544
jazz.

1454
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:26,810
So would win the apparently getting
toward chimpanzees or a kangaroo in one

1455
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:29,660
champ would kill everything. One
chimp. Yeah, they're ruthless.

1456
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:33,350
Chimps are so God damn strong.
I mean I'm sure Kangaroos are strong too,

1457
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:37,100
but I'm sure at shampoo just fucking
grab its neck and tearing shit apart.

1458
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,420
Rip Its belly open.

1459
01:28:38,421 --> 01:28:42,840
Shims can do shit with their bodies
where they grab a branch and then launch

1460
01:28:42,841 --> 01:28:45,000
themselves into the why.

1461
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:51,680
Bang on that kind of strength is really
hard for us to even wrap our fucking

1462
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:56,390
stupid heads around. Right. You know, how
many chips can you think you can do? Me?

1463
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:58,820
Yeah.
I probably couldn't do one for $1 million.

1464
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:01,980
A guy who's a really good chin up guy.

1465
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,290
Gangster 50 what is,
yeah,

1466
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:08,610
50 is just the crazy mother be like,
I got to believe like,

1467
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:11,520
or there's like some,
you know,

1468
01:29:11,521 --> 01:29:15,210
ripped up crossfit chicks on there and
it does it every day before breakfast and

1469
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:18,840
a good kid. World Record
Chin ups. Let's find out.

1470
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,850
I'm guessing.

1471
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,750
I'm guessing it's 70 5:00 AM I the
only one that thinks crossfits a cult.

1472
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:27,360
It is a call. You're
not the only one. It is,

1473
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:30,000
and there's good things and bad
things about cults. All right.

1474
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:34,230
A world record list. What is
the world record? Two. Two,
two, two, two. What is that?

1475
01:29:34,231 --> 01:29:38,760
A raccoon. Oh Shit.
Okay. The fuck is that?

1476
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:43,520
Yeah, it's erection. Okay. Here's the
here. They're circling this motherfucker.

1477
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:48,150
You're dead world records.
He's punching it like,

1478
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:52,770
fuck you. Fuck you. Take that Jab. Is that
a champion or a raccoon? I don't. Yeah.

1479
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,910
That's not even a big chance yet.
Look at it.

1480
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:59,020
I saw you fuck all my car last night. What
happened? That raccoon got into the uh,

1481
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:04,300
yeah. Oh look. That's a miss dude and
coons are tough, man. Raccoons are tough.

1482
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:08,590
Champs or fucking or not like, oh,
he's throwing, throw thought. Oh Shit.

1483
01:30:08,591 --> 01:30:11,130
They're ruthless.
They threw it off the top of a cluck.

1484
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:15,430
You let me throw you off this mountain.
Yeah, they're ruthless. All right,

1485
01:30:15,431 --> 01:30:19,480
here's the, they have most
chin ups in a minute. Okay.

1486
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:22,720
Here's the world records
for Chin ups the most, uh,

1487
01:30:22,721 --> 01:30:27,520
the record holder is a guy from the Czech
Republic. Of course, ready for this,

1488
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:32,170
or you're going to freak out.
232 pullups in 36 minutes.

1489
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:36,860
That's insane.
In 2010.

1490
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:37,880
Okay.

1491
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,930
And the Czech Republic,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1492
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,380
Have you ever seen kipping
pull ups but whatever.

1493
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:48,870
Have you ever seen the bartenders shit?
The guys who do the Barre workouts look,

1494
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:53,750
yeah, I have seen that. It's always black
guys. Look at that. Look at the Chin ups.

1495
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:57,710
Motherfuckers up though.
This isn't say kipping Chin ups pull ups.

1496
01:30:57,711 --> 01:31:00,980
What does it pull it? Chin up is
when your palms are facing forward.

1497
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:05,230
It's none of those count. Jesus Christ.
Those are insane. None of those kinds.

1498
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,250
This guy's still going.
None of those kind of look,

1499
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:11,150
he doesn't even barely break his elbows.
Well this is called his fucking head.

1500
01:31:11,151 --> 01:31:13,620
Barely touch the bars.
The bar crazy.

1501
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:16,340
He's you're kipping chin
ups or kipping pull ups.

1502
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:19,730
I guess it's a pull up comments. Which
ones a chin up and which one's a pull up?

1503
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,600
Pull up is like this, right pull
is your palms forward, Chin ups.

1504
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:27,230
Is your palms outward, is that right?
Is that it was one or the other.

1505
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:31,040
What's the difference between true
Wikipedia son? What's the difference?

1506
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:32,330
That difference.

1507
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,793
Okay,

1508
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:37,910
I'm going to guess. Chin ups are
probably the curl motion. Right. And uh,

1509
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:41,710
and pull up and pull ups are
probably palms out. Okay.

1510
01:31:41,711 --> 01:31:45,160
We're going to find out really quickly.
I don't know because I do all,

1511
01:31:45,161 --> 01:31:49,630
all look at this shit. I do all of them
cause I'm sexy as fuck. I would love,

1512
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:54,000
I would love to be able to do this.
That's a sane, just be fucking fat.

1513
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:58,210
Just to see the look on people's faces.
I when millions,

1514
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:02,710
he's doing sideways ups on a bar where
his body is sticking out like a flag.

1515
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,720
He's rushing. That's insane. Okay.

1516
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:09,610
Pullups means a proteinated overhand grip.
So pull ups,

1517
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:12,490
his palms out, Chin ups, his palms,

1518
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:16,990
which is a soup unaided or
underhanded grip. That's crazy.

1519
01:32:16,991 --> 01:32:19,810
I've never seen it before.
That's very interesting.

1520
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:25,110
Was this guy's going to do 62 in
a minute and he's 50, he's 50. Oh,

1521
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:28,930
dairy. Who is this fucking
animal? You don't have low t.

1522
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:31,060
His wife doesn't want to fuck them.
That's all that is.

1523
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:35,980
It's trying to like a truck. He's got
a string of 19 year olds. Two, three,

1524
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:40,210
four, five, six those are legit. Yeah,

1525
01:32:40,211 --> 01:32:43,870
those are wide grip.
10 1112 okay.

1526
01:32:43,871 --> 01:32:47,990
We can keep counting and the people at
home listening on iTunes or [inaudible],

1527
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:50,270
you're going to count to 100 you fuckhead.

1528
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:54,310
You're not even describing
what's happening from 50
to 63 skip them pretty is.

1529
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:58,150
It is pretty amazing. 63 that's
incredible. Who's The guy?

1530
01:32:58,151 --> 01:33:02,880
What's his story in a minute? He likes
palsy. Can't get any world records.

1531
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:05,050
Chin ups. Just say who it is. Does it say

1532
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:13,930
Stan apps that cough. Spell it. A p.

1533
01:33:13,931 --> 01:33:16,430
S. E. L. O. F. F. I guarantee.

1534
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:19,180
I guarantee you he has Ohio.

1535
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:23,410
That just goes to show you
man, Ohio. Ohio is legit. Yeah.

1536
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:26,110
I always liked the Philippines
of the United States.

1537
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:29,030
Is it really what way and pool?
That was nasty.

1538
01:33:29,031 --> 01:33:30,530
He's all of that was always nasty things.

1539
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,920
Said Ohio is the Philippines
of the United States.

1540
01:33:32,921 --> 01:33:34,960
If they're from Ohio and they've
got it on a white tee shirt,

1541
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:35,830
they will gamble with you.

1542
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:38,140
What is it about that?

1543
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:38,861
The Midwest,

1544
01:33:38,861 --> 01:33:42,040
I have so many gangster pool players
because there's nothing else to do.

1545
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:46,600
Seriously. You don't got to work.
What are you going to surf? Right.

1546
01:33:46,601 --> 01:33:50,380
You know you gonna play volleyball,
right? I mean fuck half the year's winner.

1547
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:54,850
So good luck trying to get
lights on. Right? Exactly.
So you go to the pool room,

1548
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:58,270
you play pool and there's
the Midwest is full of them.

1549
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:02,920
There's gangsters throughout Kansas City,
Missouri, Saint Louis, Shit like that.

1550
01:34:02,921 --> 01:34:05,770
Fucking players. Why did they
pick? Could take bar table though.

1551
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,910
Cause that's all they got. What's
that about? That's a lot of it fixed.

1552
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:12,480
Well that's one of the tournaments are,
but you could take some of those guys.

1553
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:16,480
Like I could go down through that part
of the Midwest and take some people and

1554
01:34:16,481 --> 01:34:21,050
run them up through New York City and
just robbed the fucking northeast. Yes.

1555
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:26,440
When I say rob, it would be hard because
you can't sneak up on anyone anymore.

1556
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,360
Right?
You can't outrun the Internet.

1557
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,290
I mean camera phones or
camera phones ruin the road.

1558
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,790
Isn't that an interesting will the,

1559
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:37,730
the websites they'll like ac billiards
did to a certain extent to too.

1560
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:42,990
It's not, but even before that, it's
just, I guarantee you could show,

1561
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:47,560
you can take me to a pool room here in
la today and there could be somebody in

1562
01:34:47,561 --> 01:34:51,190
there and if it's a legitimate player,
I could, if I don't know who they are,

1563
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:52,750
I could take their picture,

1564
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:56,650
send it to two or three
people and probably take it
everything there is to know

1565
01:34:56,651 --> 01:34:58,250
about that within 10 minutes.

1566
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:01,070
And that's without going to the Internet.

1567
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:05,960
That's just within that network and
having the ability to take a photo and

1568
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:09,050
connect and tell them,
here's what this guy looks like.

1569
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:14,120
This is a game he wants to play. What
do you know about them? And you know,

1570
01:35:14,121 --> 01:35:16,790
it's just,
it's such a small world.

1571
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:21,020
It would be like you showing like a
fighter that you knew was like a legit

1572
01:35:21,021 --> 01:35:22,700
fighter. Well, just like when I,

1573
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:27,380
when I did that celebrity pool
thing for Bravo and they were like,

1574
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:31,160
you know, hey, you know,
we're going to put together a
celebrity tournament and uh,

1575
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:34,580
we'll see, you know, like who can beat
who out of the world of celebrities?

1576
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:38,480
Like good luck. You're all playing for
second place. Sure. Absolutely. I'm like,

1577
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:41,270
I know you're all playing for second
place. And they were like laughing at me.

1578
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:44,230
Like, how do you think you're going to
win? I'm like, I'm gonna win. I'm like,

1579
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,000
not only going to win, it's going to
be easy. I'm going to show up high,

1580
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:50,150
I'm going to be highest two cookies.
I'm like,

1581
01:35:50,151 --> 01:35:53,750
there's no way they put in the
time of effort that I put in.

1582
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:57,410
He just know very few celebrities.
If they were as fucked up as I am,

1583
01:35:57,411 --> 01:36:00,470
I would know about them.
No, no. I wasn't here.

1584
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:05,150
The only people I've ever heard Paul
Sorvino, which I think he's dead now.

1585
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:10,820
Jerry Orbach Sorvino or past
right or bucket Jerry Orbach.

1586
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:15,350
Paul Sorvino, uh, David, uh,
Brennan. What's his name?

1587
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:18,920
David Brenner. Brenner. Was he a
player or was he just an investor?

1588
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:19,820
He's an investor.

1589
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:23,360
This is me running out like a
fucking world champion right here,

1590
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:28,360
ladies and gentlemen with Max.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was, yeah,

1591
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:29,980
me and Max.
I believe when I was taking us,

1592
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:34,110
I took a lot of lessons from Max Everly.
Powerful Max. Yeah. Max Happily went,

1593
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:36,800
that was back in his Vegan. I was
responsible for getting them off that.

1594
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:40,460
See me now? Yeah. He eats
everything now. Beautiful.

1595
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:45,930
He started eating fish. He started
off with Sushi. How it starts. Yeah.

1596
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,480
It's how we all start.

1597
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:51,860
But Max changed my fundamentals and
people think that pool was like a stupid

1598
01:36:51,861 --> 01:36:56,120
game and it is kind of a
stupid came. It's, it's, it's,
I'm, I'm telling you stupid.

1599
01:36:56,210 --> 01:37:00,770
If you're not a, uh, if you're not
a player, I mean, if you're not,

1600
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:03,800
and I tell people this, it's like
I do it for a living man. I mean,

1601
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:08,090
that's what I sell for a living is pool.
But if you're not into it,

1602
01:37:08,091 --> 01:37:12,080
if you don't understand it, you know,
it's like me trying to watch golf.

1603
01:37:12,081 --> 01:37:14,630
I don't play golf is a video
of you and me plan? Yes.

1604
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:19,040
Somebody who ran the fuck out.
You ran out. Yeah, there's a,

1605
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:22,790
yeah, I think it's just the best
video is you do on the Earl though.

1606
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,730
Me laughing like a fucking
retard over top of you.

1607
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,310
I was nervous when I met him that
he was going to be mad at me,

1608
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:32,770
but he wasn't mad at me at all. He
was a, he was. That was easy. Yeah.

1609
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:37,250
I mean arose.
I was a fan.

1610
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,600
Mosconi Cup is in Vegas this year.
When is they make it? When is it?

1611
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:43,880
It's the first weekend in December.
Let me see right now. Hold on a second.

1612
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:51,140
Are you broadcasting? No,
we're doing well. Actually
I can't spill any beans yet.

1613
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:56,220
We're trying. We're trying to,
we're trying to do something
before Moscone starts.

1614
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:58,950
I'm open that week, man. Maybe we
should do something. It starts moaning.

1615
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:03,150
Mosconi Cup starts Monday. That'll be fun.
Yeah. I would like to be there for that.

1616
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:06,900
I think that'd be fun. It's fun if you've
never been to one. They are a blast.

1617
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:10,530
I mean we could do something because it's
because it's like big money production.

1618
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:10,950
Yeah.

1619
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:15,950
It's like the only legit real
television production in pool.

1620
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,500
We could do something with pool man.
We can pull needs something.

1621
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:22,390
It needs something right now. Needs
a little, a little juice, you know,

1622
01:38:22,391 --> 01:38:25,800
I'll no ship. If you and
I got behind something, we
could do something right now.

1623
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:26,820
We can make something fun.

1624
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:30,900
I think the only thing that has any shot
to get mainstream acceptance of pool

1625
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,000
naked girls is that,

1626
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:37,980
or some kind of reality show or just a
character study to where you like you

1627
01:38:37,981 --> 01:38:42,900
picked the most fucked up.
Follow around for six months.

1628
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:47,010
People would watch. I would watch
that. Yeah. Well Earl is you,

1629
01:38:47,011 --> 01:38:50,630
like you said earlier, seven miles in the
morning, seven o'clock in the afternoon.

1630
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:52,590
14 miles a day.
He's a maniac.

1631
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:56,280
He probably stabbed you in the eye times
before the filming is over, but Nah,

1632
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:57,390
he wouldn't ever stop me.

1633
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,780
Me and her would get along
would be awesome if you could.

1634
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:04,830
If you could do something to where like
you and Earl went on the road. Yeah.

1635
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,670
Oh my God.

1636
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:09,390
I mean row like when we were hanging
out together talking like there was,

1637
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:10,590
even though I'd made fun of him,

1638
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:13,590
I know he got bummed out that I made fun
of them, but I only made fun of them.

1639
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,260
I do an impression because I'm a huge fan.
Right.

1640
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:19,910
Email could you add impression was
if you didn't know him, right? Yeah.

1641
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,640
So he knew that like when
I started talking to him
that I wasn't an asshole and

1642
01:39:23,641 --> 01:39:25,500
then I, you know, I really said, I go,

1643
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:28,260
you're one of my favorite players
of all time and that's a 100% legit.

1644
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:32,460
He w he and I wouldn't have a problem. He
would be crazy. But I'm pretty easy man.

1645
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:37,520
You know? I know crazy. It's
if someone was like, if like
you a guy like you, yeah.

1646
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:40,650
All of a sudden became crazy. Sure.
I'd be bummed out. I'd be like, damn,

1647
01:39:40,651 --> 01:39:42,970
what the fuck happened him?
Why do you go to stupid? Yeah.

1648
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,810
But if it's just a crazy dude being crazy,

1649
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:50,040
that's like asking water and not be
wet, you know, it's like water is wet.

1650
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,650
It is, it is. What it is. Oh, here it is.

1651
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:55,480
Are going to play pool if
you're not properly equipped.

1652
01:39:55,990 --> 01:40:00,730
Where's your 80% people
quotes all the time.

1653
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,740
Everywhere I go,
what are you doing?

1654
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:06,310
It might be it my grace impression of
all time and it's super obscure this.

1655
01:40:06,311 --> 01:40:08,260
Most people don't know
where else strict on jump.

1656
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:12,920
Tusaro jump to jump with a fucking junkie.

1657
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:16,910
That ain't what the fuck is nice.
He's got a tiny little shoes.

1658
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:18,310
Y'all pleased as punch.

1659
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,480
He's got a big smile on your face like
you just did something. Get the fuck dad.

1660
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:27,160
Jump with a full table with a Meucci.
Don't understand.

1661
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:28,983
After this,

1662
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:35,440
after this you have to Google
Earl Strickland ranch. Oh really?

1663
01:40:35,441 --> 01:40:38,860
Sounds like when the marijuana,
I said a lot of my plans was marijuana.

1664
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:43,790
Earl got all paranoid. How's you
know I do marijuana even said that.

1665
01:40:43,791 --> 01:40:46,480
How's he know training?
He was saying marijuana.

1666
01:40:46,481 --> 01:40:49,870
Did you tell him I smoke marijuana?
Well you guys talking about marijuana.

1667
01:40:49,871 --> 01:40:51,070
Is it commonly known?

1668
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:54,070
Earl smokes all the weed. Well, Mad Max,

1669
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,080
I believe,
told me and rob cy as told me,

1670
01:40:56,380 --> 01:41:00,700
you know that the of their adventures
together, the Earl Strip. Well look,

1671
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:03,610
a guy who's that good at pool.
Why would he not fuck with marijuana?

1672
01:41:03,611 --> 01:41:07,360
Marijuana makes if people who don't know,
I know you don't like rock with it.

1673
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:11,050
It makes you very sensitive to movement.
But the thing is he,

1674
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:14,350
that's probably the only thing he can
do to keep his mind and this fucking

1675
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:16,950
atmosphere. Yeah, there's
a little bit, man,

1676
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:22,240
he's Earl is people genius.
He's,

1677
01:41:22,241 --> 01:41:25,990
he says you cannot subpool genius.
You can't take it away from him.

1678
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:30,370
He's a pool genius and like many people
that are genius at something, the,

1679
01:41:30,371 --> 01:41:34,070
as we said before,
that genius comes out of a,

1680
01:41:34,071 --> 01:41:37,450
a bit of madness and look at him.
He's all pissed off.

1681
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,600
Well the Mosconi Cup is really interesting
because it's like the UK or Europe

1682
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:46,750
versus the United States. All
this is, that still blows up.

1683
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:50,260
I'll look at it as she's
pretty, yeah, she is cool.

1684
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:54,400
An Earl gets crazy.
Can I box out of everybody?

1685
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:58,870
He also puts weird shit on, like look at
it, look at the eyes, look at the eyes.

1686
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,033
They're all laughing.

1687
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:09,550
He's so serious. He's like a character
and character. He's a man. That shit man.

1688
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,950
He's like a comedian. But I mean he's
serious about it. Yeah. It's like,

1689
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:16,120
that's one of the things I was talking
to Jason Shaw about when he came down for

1690
01:42:16,121 --> 01:42:19,760
our last match. Uh, you
know, he said it amazed him.

1691
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:21,700
He stayed with her at all and he goes,

1692
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,650
Earl woke up in the morning talking
about pool and when he went to sleep at

1693
01:42:26,651 --> 01:42:30,430
night, he was still talking about pool.
Yeah, he's Legit, you know. I mean,

1694
01:42:30,431 --> 01:42:31,720
think about it. I mean, you don't,

1695
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:35,180
whenever we hang out it's like
you don't talk about it. Yeah.

1696
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:38,110
You don't talk about UFC from the time
we started at the time we end. No,

1697
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:40,780
you won't talk about comedy from the
time we start to tell them we in. Yeah.

1698
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:43,270
You know, it's every hang out
like a normal fucking person.

1699
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:47,080
Well that's the thing about pool though.
Pool requires that of you.

1700
01:42:47,081 --> 01:42:48,820
Pool is like the craziest needy.

1701
01:42:48,821 --> 01:42:52,060
His girlfriend in the history of the
universe at a high level, it's sick.

1702
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,510
The bitch wants to see you all day every
day you go to bed and then when you

1703
01:42:55,511 --> 01:42:58,900
wake up, where are you?
Right here, right me,

1704
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:01,570
wake up right and pool might wake you
up in the middle of the night with a new

1705
01:43:01,571 --> 01:43:05,020
move. Pull my weight. You
don't have to get out that way.

1706
01:43:05,021 --> 01:43:07,900
You know you play it like this.
Then you play for the fourth ball.

1707
01:43:07,901 --> 01:43:10,600
You're playing for the third row. If you
play for the ankle on the fourth ball,

1708
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,520
then the,
if you look the fifth balls on the rail,

1709
01:43:12,521 --> 01:43:16,000
if the fifth Paul's on the round, you
know, it depends on what I've seen.

1710
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:18,070
I've seen her.
I'll do that after matches.

1711
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:22,750
He'll come in the next day and set it
up and talk and talk about his shot.

1712
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:27,720
That was in like the seventh game and
it's like, yeah, it's like you go here.

1713
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:30,250
If I remember it was meaningless.
Yeah.

1714
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:34,360
It would be like a football player
talking about a fucking play that got two

1715
01:43:34,361 --> 01:43:38,110
yards and the second quarter with
20 minutes to go. I mean it's,

1716
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:40,600
it's like something that means nothing
and he talks about it like as a

1717
01:43:40,601 --> 01:43:45,490
disastrous date that he just got home
from right. Yeah. It's, I dunno man,

1718
01:43:45,491 --> 01:43:47,260
those guys.
And what's funny is

1719
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:53,930
most the players in the world
have played for us on our,

1720
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:56,780
on our matches.
Um,

1721
01:43:57,110 --> 01:43:59,930
you can't name a pool player
that's hasn't played for us.

1722
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,810
It's not top of the world.
Top 10,

1723
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:06,590
20 players in the world have all played
in our matches at one time or another.

1724
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:09,950
And for the most part,

1725
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,450
the Americans are the craziest in general,

1726
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:19,310
like most mental about shit.
Um,

1727
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:22,520
the Filipinos are the most laid back,

1728
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,600
which is funny because they play
like the Filipinos literally,

1729
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:34,880
if they win $1,000 here,
it's like five or six grand back home.

1730
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,800
It's a huge amount of money.

1731
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:41,210
And maybe that's why they are laid back
is because of whatever score they make

1732
01:44:41,211 --> 01:44:44,750
here they is bigger back home.
Whereas here,

1733
01:44:44,751 --> 01:44:49,220
if an American player wins
three or four grand, you know,

1734
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:54,310
if you tell any normal human being on
earth that works for 15 or $20 an hour,

1735
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:59,900
you can make $3,000 in a weekend. There
would be like fuck that's good money.

1736
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:03,920
But you know for someone who
is at the top of their game,

1737
01:45:03,921 --> 01:45:06,140
yeah it sucks and you would
think they would make more.

1738
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:10,580
It sucks for a pro athlete and I split
at the same time it comes and this is

1739
01:45:10,581 --> 01:45:15,260
like, this is one of the battles I'm
fighting is I tell people like, look man,

1740
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:21,130
if I could pay you guys 10 grand I would
cause it makes everybody better but I

1741
01:45:21,681 --> 01:45:26,510
can only pay you what people will pay.
You know,

1742
01:45:26,511 --> 01:45:30,280
cause I eat what I kill.
I mean the way I do it is I've,

1743
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:31,520
there's no sponsors.

1744
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:35,900
There was nobody here giving me
five or $10,000 to do a match.

1745
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,590
It doesn't work like that.
It's Manny Pacquiao.

1746
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:44,420
What I take in on fucking paper view
is what pays for all the freight. Dude.

1747
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:47,900
That's the big pay per view.
Me Versus Manny Pacquiao.
That would be sick. Come on.

1748
01:45:47,901 --> 01:45:51,330
So I think you'd be rob. I'd be
robbed. He would rob me. Damn.

1749
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:54,470
From what I understand, I have to
get in stroke. I have to get crazy.

1750
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:57,440
And you just have to outbox him. Yeah.
Well according to Max Aberly Max,

1751
01:45:57,441 --> 01:45:59,640
everybody says he plays it very good.
Yeah.

1752
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:02,770
Max Planning to race a 10
and he only beat him like,

1753
01:46:02,771 --> 01:46:05,180
I think he beat him six
or seven to 10 right.

1754
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:09,230
Which if you know how good Max plays
Max's mother fucking world class.

1755
01:46:09,231 --> 01:46:12,830
But Amy's got a great reputation as
a solid player. Yeah. He said, man,

1756
01:46:12,831 --> 01:46:15,620
he gets out and being
from the Philippines,

1757
01:46:15,621 --> 01:46:19,010
it's like it plays all those killers
every day. They call him the cow.

1758
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:23,450
Oh look at Max with the
long hair and and go, wow,

1759
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:25,310
this is a Manny Pacquiao.

1760
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:28,940
If for first shot is not listening
or listening and not watching,

1761
01:46:28,941 --> 01:46:32,300
rather this is Manny Pacquiao,
shooting some kind of crazy trick shot,

1762
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:36,200
which I don't know how to do one
single looking at many packer.

1763
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:40,280
I was a lefty too. That's interesting.
That's worth a ball right there. Yeah.

1764
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:44,390
There's something about lefties,
man, there's fucking shot.

1765
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:47,450
Dang man. He made it.
I made all those balls.

1766
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:50,430
There's something about lefthanded people.

1767
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:54,540
This is an athletically lefthanded
athletically. I believe that.

1768
01:46:55,410 --> 01:47:00,390
I've seen pictures, quarterbacks. It's
crazy. Yeah. I don't know what it is.

1769
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:02,640
I think it's a nonconformity thing.

1770
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:05,940
I think that lefthanded people have to
figure things out for themselves and it

1771
01:47:05,941 --> 01:47:08,850
makes you smarter because
everybody else is going one way.

1772
01:47:08,851 --> 01:47:13,850
You have everything else in the world is
fucking opposite and from striking from

1773
01:47:13,851 --> 01:47:15,180
a standpoint of striking,

1774
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:17,860
a lot of people have a hard time with
people that fight in the south pole

1775
01:47:17,861 --> 01:47:19,830
position with his right hand
forward instead of left.

1776
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:24,060
Isn't that a big thing in boxing though?
People who go, you switch. The good guys,

1777
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:27,450
the greatest ever at switching
is Marvin Hagler. Marvelous.

1778
01:47:27,451 --> 01:47:28,680
Marvin Hagler was like,

1779
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:31,920
he would fuck guys up because you expect
them to come out south and he would

1780
01:47:31,921 --> 01:47:35,760
come out Orthodox and just put a beat on
you because he could fight Orthodox as

1781
01:47:35,761 --> 01:47:40,260
good as he could. Fight
southpaw cause that very rare
to, hey, very rare. So do you,

1782
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:41,910
what's the deal?

1783
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:46,020
Do you still think boxing is viable sport
or is it just so fucking corrupt and

1784
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:47,910
fucked up that no,
it's viable.

1785
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:51,210
Viable because there's awesome guys
there that are excellent at it.

1786
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:54,500
You know there's like a lot of people
like think that I don't like boxing

1787
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:58,860
because I got in an argument with some
asshole on ESPN who was a boxing promoter

1788
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:02,280
and you know, I shouldn't call him an
asshole. He's just defending his turf.

1789
01:48:02,281 --> 01:48:06,240
And the whole reason why we even had this
thing is cause ESPN was trying to set

1790
01:48:06,241 --> 01:48:09,450
up this dispute between boxing and MMA.
Which one's better?

1791
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:13,740
And I was cool with it all
until he was calling MMA like,

1792
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,690
like human cock fighting.

1793
01:48:15,691 --> 01:48:19,080
Like they have this attitude that it's
like some barbaric sport and I'm like,

1794
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:22,110
look, you're being stupid. Like you
don't think it was 15 years ago.

1795
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:25,860
Well it's not only that,
it's like boxing is a part of MMA.

1796
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:29,920
It's a key aspect of MMA. You don't have
good boxing, you can't have them in that.

1797
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:33,300
It's like, but MMA, if you like,

1798
01:48:33,301 --> 01:48:36,810
you get a boxer who's a really good
boxer and that's all he trains his boxing

1799
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:40,380
and he gets in there with a guy who
was an MMA fighter. He's fucked up.

1800
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:41,760
He's going to get his legs kicked.

1801
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:43,800
It's going to get kneed in
the body and the clinch,

1802
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,920
he's going to get taken down a mountain.
He's going to get smashed as strangled.

1803
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:48,000
That's just a fact.

1804
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:51,510
It doesn't mean that boxing is an
exciting and that I don't lock box,

1805
01:48:51,570 --> 01:48:53,730
that I don't like boxing.
I would've never said what I said.

1806
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:54,720
If that guy was in a deck,

1807
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:59,010
if that guy got on that ESPN
interview with me and if he said that,

1808
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,550
I think mixed martial arts is a
very exciting sport for some folks.

1809
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:06,450
They though they prefer just striking.
I would've said absolutely. You know,

1810
01:49:06,451 --> 01:49:08,970
there's something for everybody,
some people for, for soccer.

1811
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:13,080
So I'm guys like baseball. You know,
I, I, I'm a huge fan of striking.

1812
01:49:13,081 --> 01:49:14,760
Striking is what I started out with.

1813
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:19,230
But boxing striking is even like
if I was going to watch any fight,

1814
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:24,600
legit straight striking fight. I want to
watch more Thai. Have you seen a glory?

1815
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:29,250
Glory is a, it's, it's debuting
on a spike actually tomorrow,

1816
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:32,100
tonight or tomorrow. What's that?
The 11th I think it's tomorrow.

1817
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,360
Whatever the fuck it is.

1818
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:38,070
Glory is this new high level kickboxing
event where they're taking the best

1819
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:41,820
kickboxers in the world. Most of them
are European because like in Holland,

1820
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:45,990
kickboxing got fucking gigantic.
It's huge.

1821
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:51,170
And his great fighters came from Han
like Ramon Dekkers above Ernesto hoost.

1822
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:54,500
Rob came in like some of the
greatest kickboxers of all time,

1823
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:56,950
all came from Holland
for some strange reason.

1824
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:01,360
And then there's also this great guys
that fight in all sorts of Delhi.

1825
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:04,090
Romania has a lot of great
fighters like Daniel Gita.

1826
01:50:04,091 --> 01:50:07,280
There's a lot of great and there's a lot
of great American kickboxers that are

1827
01:50:07,281 --> 01:50:11,590
coming up right now too. But when it
comes to like pound for pound excitement,

1828
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:15,410
kickboxing is way more exciting
than regular boxing to me. Sure has.

1829
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:19,090
His leg kicks and knees and head kicks.
There's a lot of craziness.

1830
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:23,410
Now you're talking about because you
were a traditional martial arts guy,

1831
01:50:23,411 --> 01:50:27,640
so taekwondo when I first started,
when you first started, but um,

1832
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:31,270
so now are those like tournaments,

1833
01:50:31,271 --> 01:50:33,490
those sports obsolete,

1834
01:50:34,230 --> 01:50:37,530
are they hurting for talent because
everyone's going to MMA is money?

1835
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,830
Well they also, they're going the,
the big thing about martial arts,

1836
01:50:41,831 --> 01:50:42,521
when I was a kid,

1837
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:45,190
when I was first starting out and
I had to choose a martial art,

1838
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:47,920
it was always a very difficult to figure
out what was the best martial art.

1839
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,840
And you had to kind of
decide for yourself.

1840
01:50:49,841 --> 01:50:51,670
You got to watch people
and decide for yourself.

1841
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:54,760
And it was really hard to quantify.

1842
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:56,320
It was really hard to figure
out what was the best.

1843
01:50:56,500 --> 01:51:00,010
Then the ultimate fighting championship
came along and now there's no question,

1844
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:05,190
now we know what you need in an all out
fight and a mixed martial arts fight

1845
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,350
where essentially there's
a limited set of rules.

1846
01:51:09,190 --> 01:51:13,300
We know what you need to learn how to
do and it's not taekwondo and it's not

1847
01:51:13,301 --> 01:51:16,690
Moitai and it's not wrestling and
it's not Jujitsu. It's all of them.

1848
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:19,570
And if you don't know how
to do any of those aspects,

1849
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:21,040
if you're a really good wrestler,

1850
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:25,060
but the guy you're fighting knows how
to defend the takedown and he could fuck

1851
01:51:25,061 --> 01:51:27,070
you upstanding,
you got a real problem.

1852
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:29,260
And that's what a lot of
wrestlers are dealing with today.

1853
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:33,970
They don't know how to strike and they
face a guy who develops like Mirko Cro,

1854
01:51:33,971 --> 01:51:38,870
cop and pride days had really good take
down stuff and take down and then you

1855
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:42,370
walked with head kicks and there's nothing
you can do about it and you get hit

1856
01:51:42,371 --> 01:51:45,010
by that shit. You're going
night night. So there's that.

1857
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:47,740
Then there's also these wrestlers
that figuring out Jujitsu,

1858
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:49,440
they can take you down.
It's strangle you,

1859
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:52,330
you've gotta be able to stuff that take
down. If you can't stop that take down,

1860
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:54,850
they're gonna take you down every
time. If you can, stuff that take down,

1861
01:51:54,851 --> 01:51:57,130
but they can't stand up,
you're going to fuck them up every time.

1862
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,890
There's a lot of variables
and that's what we know now.

1863
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:02,440
We didn't know that when I was
starting out, when I was starting out,

1864
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:06,070
it was no one knew what was the right
way to do, whether it was it was boxing,

1865
01:52:06,071 --> 01:52:09,150
but there was wrestling, whether it was
taekwondo or karate or morning time.

1866
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:12,580
No one knew. Do you think he meant may
guys are wanting to like the second,

1867
01:52:12,581 --> 01:52:15,640
third generation?
I don't know how many generations.

1868
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:18,700
I don't know if there's a need to,
to numerically ordered them.

1869
01:52:18,701 --> 01:52:23,050
But I would say that today we have a
much better sense of what is ultimately

1870
01:52:23,051 --> 01:52:25,630
effective in martial arts
than we did even a year ago.

1871
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,550
Just in the last couple of years,

1872
01:52:27,551 --> 01:52:31,540
we've seen an increase in the number
of traditional martial arts techniques.

1873
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:34,570
Front kick to the face and
Anderson Silva landed on v tour.

1874
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:39,160
The wheel kicks that had been landed
v toward landed a wheel kick. Um, uh,

1875
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:41,440
junior dos Santos knocked out
Mark Hunt with a wheel kick.

1876
01:52:41,441 --> 01:52:43,210
Edson Barboza knocked out Terry Adam,

1877
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:46,070
there's all these wheel kicks
now that we haven't seen before.

1878
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:50,840
And those were always viable techniques
in taekwondo and in a kickboxing

1879
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:51,693
Kyokushin,

1880
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:55,160
but we haven't seen them in MMA because
the guys who are really good at them

1881
01:52:55,161 --> 01:52:58,340
didn't fight MMA. They fought kyokah
should and they fought taekwondo,

1882
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,710
but now we're seeing these
MMA guys realize, hey,

1883
01:53:00,711 --> 01:53:03,980
this is a really tricky weapon
that I can add to my arsenal.

1884
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:08,060
So the arsenal instead of being a
hundred moves deep is now 200 moves.

1885
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:09,680
T there's not two 50 moves deep.

1886
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:12,700
There's a lot of new shit that
people learning how to do that.

1887
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:15,740
This is the old techniques that
everybody thought didn't work like you're

1888
01:53:15,741 --> 01:53:19,790
starting to see acts kicks again. Guys
are throwing it off shifts and Emma, yeah,

1889
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:23,000
rich Clemente through one the other day
and Bella toward John Jones through one

1890
01:53:23,001 --> 01:53:24,230
in the UFC,

1891
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:28,370
but they're still not at the level of
the ax kicks of like a guy like Jersey

1892
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:32,450
long who was a Canadian MMA champion
who was, it had this nasty ax kick.

1893
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:35,090
It was like getting hit in the
head with a fucking baseball bat.

1894
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:40,400
This mother fucker would just full split
wing up and slam that heel down in your

1895
01:53:40,401 --> 01:53:41,780
face and you would go to sleep.

1896
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:46,720
He knocked out a friend of mine out cold
with an ax kick in a tournament that's

1897
01:53:46,721 --> 01:53:49,640
his due date,
Jersey long and it was so nasty.

1898
01:53:49,641 --> 01:53:52,550
It was like getting hit by a sniper,
the way the dude.

1899
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:55,190
And it made me change
my whole ax kick game.

1900
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:58,700
I put way more credence into ax kicks.

1901
01:53:58,701 --> 01:54:01,130
I didn't think that aks kicks
could knock guys unconscious.

1902
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:04,190
I just thought it kick. It was like
a flashy technique that you use.

1903
01:54:04,191 --> 01:54:07,780
But I never saw anybody go to sleep
till this guy named Jersey long fun.

1904
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:11,990
It was like 1980,
probably two or something like that.

1905
01:54:11,991 --> 01:54:13,640
And he fought my friend and acts,

1906
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:16,460
kicked him in the head and knocked
him out cold. It was brutal.

1907
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:20,060
The way he did it too is so fast.
We just not,

1908
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:23,810
we're not seeing that speed of execution,
that fluidity of motion,

1909
01:54:23,811 --> 01:54:24,644
that economy of,

1910
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:29,720
of movement that a guy who's a
really high level taekwondo guy has,

1911
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:34,700
uh, in that, in that, um, in MMA
there's a guy named herb Perez.

1912
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:38,420
I saw him a knock out this dude I
think the Tuesday and was not seem,

1913
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:40,190
I forgot the guy's last name,

1914
01:54:40,191 --> 01:54:42,980
but the guy was a high level guy as well
and herb knocked him out with the ax

1915
01:54:42,981 --> 01:54:47,390
kick to the head right in front of me.
I was like my first national tournament.

1916
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:51,490
Um, I had lost, I lost
my first fight and uh,

1917
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:56,390
it was probably, I was probably like 18
or 19, and I remember watching this guy,

1918
01:54:56,391 --> 01:54:59,510
her Perez knock this dude out with
a fucking ax kicked of the head.

1919
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:03,560
Like as far as a way as you are
standing on the sideline and I saw this,

1920
01:55:03,561 --> 01:55:05,990
he'll land on this dude's head
and I re that was one of the,

1921
01:55:05,991 --> 01:55:09,770
one of the main moments in my
life where I realized, Oh shit,

1922
01:55:09,771 --> 01:55:12,980
like national champions can also
get knocked the fuck out. Right?

1923
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,120
Everybody can get knocked out.
If you miss something. Yeah.

1924
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:19,940
If you zig when you should have zagged
and someone kicks you in your face,

1925
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:21,170
you're going to go to sleep.

1926
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:26,640
And that's a technique like we haven't
seen yet really effectively in MMA.

1927
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:30,890
Andy Hook used it in k one he used that.
There was a, there's a few other guys,

1928
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:31,910
there's a couple of guys I've,

1929
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:35,840
I saw a Russian dude who throws a
mean ass kickers fighting MMA in a,

1930
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:38,930
a small organization,
but we haven't seen it in the UFC yet.

1931
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:43,830
Wasn't any going to do a fight
with one of the guys? Yeah, yeah.

1932
01:55:43,831 --> 01:55:47,460
They're going to do a grappling match.
A rematch of the fight they had in 2000.

1933
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:48,760
What's the name of that series?

1934
01:55:48,761 --> 01:55:51,400
Cause I'll watch on metamorris
watch some of that on Youtube.

1935
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:55,100
Metamorris is a huge,
huge grappling organization.

1936
01:55:55,101 --> 01:55:56,660
They're putting together this really,

1937
01:55:56,750 --> 01:56:01,750
like they had Hixon son Kron for
[inaudible] who's a famous MMA fighter.

1938
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:06,050
Very good grappler from uh, Japan
and uh, chronic guillotine dumb.

1939
01:56:06,051 --> 01:56:07,550
And that was a really exciting match.

1940
01:56:07,551 --> 01:56:12,551
And they've had some like real high
level MMA fighters and Brazilian Jujitsu

1941
01:56:12,610 --> 01:56:14,780
fighters. It's submission
artists, California,

1942
01:56:14,781 --> 01:56:16,910
one of the bigger communities
for Brazilian Jujitsu,

1943
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:19,640
one of the biggest of the world,
one of the biggest in the world.

1944
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:22,610
And there's so many Brazilian Jujitsu
schools in southern California.

1945
01:56:22,611 --> 01:56:26,440
It's almost like beyond recognition
or beyond a comprehension. There's,

1946
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:31,300
there's a massive amount. There's so many
high level guys here. Hickson's hear it.

1947
01:56:31,301 --> 01:56:33,800
Well, his son Crohn is here now. Um, uh,

1948
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:37,550
John Jacques Machado is like one
of the all time greats is here.

1949
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:41,660
If I here for doom is here and
there's a lot of great MMA fighters.

1950
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:45,590
Would also teach you to how Natto
Baba Lou. So brawls here, you know,

1951
01:56:45,591 --> 01:56:50,500
there's a million Alberto cranes
here. This is, it goes on on a hoist.

1952
01:56:50,501 --> 01:56:54,510
Grace, he's here. Henner grace.
Who's he? He, Ron Gracie's here. Hell

1953
01:56:56,050 --> 01:57:00,680
yeah. Horian uh, you know, is here
that there's so many guys here.

1954
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:02,690
They just,
they came from Brazil and they're like,

1955
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:05,210
there's those little kind of crazy,
and there's a beach here too.

1956
01:57:05,211 --> 01:57:08,390
Let's just fucking, let's just
stop here in southern California.

1957
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:11,480
And then of course when
Emma May start to explode,

1958
01:57:11,481 --> 01:57:13,560
this was like the glamor
market, right? You know,

1959
01:57:13,561 --> 01:57:15,860
and there's a lot of money here and
there's a lot of people here is a lot of

1960
01:57:15,861 --> 01:57:19,340
people who want to learn Jujitsu.
It's a good place to open up a school.

1961
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:24,380
But the biggest school in the country
is a apparently Henzel Gracie school in

1962
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:29,150
Manhattan has a giant school,
but people love that guy so much.

1963
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:33,250
Henzel Gracie was like one of the best
personalities and mixed martial arts and

1964
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:35,870
a two period, just amazing, amazing guy.

1965
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:40,280
Like a really a fun guy to be around.
Great sense of humor, great ego,

1966
01:57:40,281 --> 01:57:42,590
great perspective.
And because of that,

1967
01:57:42,591 --> 01:57:46,490
he has like this fiercely loyal
following and he's a huge, huge fucking,

1968
01:57:46,491 --> 01:57:50,630
I could see that going completely crazy
in a place like Manhattan. Yeah, yeah,

1969
01:57:50,631 --> 01:57:55,100
yeah. He's got a giant studio. I think
he has hundreds of students in Manhattan,

1970
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:57,860
but Manhattan is stupid expensive.

1971
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:01,650
That's what I mean. Could you imagine
what a studio cost, but, but then again,

1972
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:04,590
I mean all your students would
probably fucking millionaires.

1973
01:58:04,591 --> 01:58:05,730
So what's the difference?

1974
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:08,730
Well, I can't ask how many
millionaires in Manhattan.

1975
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:10,530
There's a fuck load of
millionaires in Manhattan.

1976
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:15,570
A lot of people in Manhattan also that
it just like barely getting by like

1977
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:19,620
credit card and paying their
rent. Yeah. Feeding themselves.

1978
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:24,440
But I mean Manhattan, that's one
thing. Like I you, we were there,

1979
01:58:24,441 --> 01:58:28,310
we were to Amsterdam. Yeah.
You know, you've got to
Amsterdam billiards and it's,

1980
01:58:28,311 --> 01:58:32,600
that's why I love, that's probably one of
my favorite pool rooms on earth. Me Too,

1981
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:37,220
because it's just a legit,
I mean it's a beautiful place.

1982
01:58:37,221 --> 01:58:41,170
It's ran well. They take care of
it. Clean, organized the, yeah.

1983
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:46,540
Nice little waiters and waitresses,
you know, courteous to you and,

1984
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:52,150
but it, it's one of the few,
you know, it's hard to explain,

1985
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:53,680
but you know,

1986
01:58:53,681 --> 01:58:57,550
you go in there and you don't have
the feeling a lot of pool rooms,

1987
01:58:57,551 --> 01:58:58,840
especially in the Midwest,

1988
01:58:59,350 --> 01:59:02,830
you walk in and you can almost
taste the fucking desperation.

1989
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:08,320
You know what I'm talking about? I mean,
it's like, it's just like the sign,

1990
01:59:08,321 --> 01:59:13,321
the cigarette covered sign on the
wall that says pool $2 for five hours.

1991
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:17,200
Yeah. I mean, it's just
like, oh, Jesus, you know?

1992
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:22,470
But to me like a room in Amsterdam
that caters to executive plying to yes.

1993
01:59:24,970 --> 01:59:29,920
And the people, it's somebody,
like if I, if I had a date,

1994
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:32,680
I would take her to Amsterdam.
Yeah.

1995
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:37,570
There's maybe two or three pool rooms
in the country I would take a date to.

1996
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:40,270
Yeah.
I love hard time outside of that,

1997
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:45,400
but I wouldn't take a date to
hard times now. Sacramento or, uh,

1998
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:50,080
or Bellflower. I mean, a hard
times. I love hard times for
the history. Yeah. I mean,

1999
01:59:50,081 --> 01:59:53,320
the history,
if you know what the f you know,

2000
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:56,500
that's gotta be like
probably Yankee Stadium,

2001
01:59:56,501 --> 02:00:00,700
old Yankee stadium or Fenway park is
to a baseball guy and it's still there.

2002
02:00:00,890 --> 02:00:05,760
If you go there at any Sunday. Yes. If
you know the history of it, it's, it's,

2003
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:07,360
um, it's cool. Yeah. I mean,

2004
02:00:07,361 --> 02:00:10,550
you can go in there and you can look
at that table and know that, you know,

2005
02:00:10,551 --> 02:00:15,250
it saves him morale is probably played
on that table in 1986 or whenever the

2006
02:00:15,251 --> 02:00:17,980
fuck he came there,
which that's the name for.

2007
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:21,250
And Reyes who Efrin Ray was
just considered in my opinion,

2008
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:25,330
the best player of all time.
He's still alive. Still Plan. Um,

2009
02:00:25,930 --> 02:00:29,110
and most humble,
professional,

2010
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:31,390
nicest dude in the world.

2011
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:35,560
Who's done more things on a
pool table than anyone else?

2012
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:38,860
I think we'll probably ever do
you just use the backs? Well,

2013
02:00:38,861 --> 02:00:40,900
what's amazing about a
place like hard times,

2014
02:00:40,901 --> 02:00:43,780
there's a guy like me could
enter into a tournament and play.

2015
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,890
Like last time I played in a hard time
tournament I played or necessarily demand

2016
02:00:46,891 --> 02:00:47,530
gas.
Right?

2017
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:52,420
Anessa Domingo's is as a high
level pro guy for 20 years.

2018
02:00:52,450 --> 02:00:54,610
Been a great player.
Great Guy Too.

2019
02:00:54,610 --> 02:00:57,040
And his son Oscar Domingez
a also high level pro.

2020
02:00:57,160 --> 02:01:02,160
You could play against professionals
like a regular guy on the weekend.

2021
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:06,580
That's a good thing and that's also
a terrible thing in my opinion.

2022
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:07,840
What's a terrible aspect of it?

2023
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:13,140
Because there was no one's going to pay
to watch if they can go pay $10 and play

2024
02:01:14,021 --> 02:01:17,140
with them. Is that true though?
Yes. I don't know if that's true.

2025
02:01:17,141 --> 02:01:20,530
I think the real issue with watching
the real issue was watching this,

2026
02:01:20,531 --> 02:01:23,650
this is not enough people participating
if I think this is true. Yeah,

2027
02:01:23,651 --> 02:01:26,890
I agree with that.
That I think there was an element of both,

2028
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:29,190
I think pools in art form that the
only people that could appreciate it,

2029
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:31,050
that people that can do it.
Sure what,

2030
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:36,010
but that's a lot of things and that's
kind of where I've made my peace with the

2031
02:01:36,011 --> 02:01:41,011
whole thing is like there's a lot of
people in the industry that seem to think

2032
02:01:42,141 --> 02:01:43,430
that there's this magic bullet.

2033
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:47,570
You can shoot at it and mainstream
approval will come and all of a sudden

2034
02:01:47,571 --> 02:01:50,330
there'll be millions and millions of
dollars flowing into the industry.

2035
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:55,010
I don't believe that because I can't
think of anything else where that's ever

2036
02:01:55,011 --> 02:01:59,450
happened. People always want
to compare pool to poker,

2037
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,050
but it's completely not
even the same thing.

2038
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:07,700
It's really thing about poker is they
came out with that fucking camera that

2039
02:02:07,701 --> 02:02:09,920
allows you to see what the
person's hand was. Yes.

2040
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:14,210
So that person at home has an inside view
and they get to see the drama of feel

2041
02:02:14,211 --> 02:02:17,870
like God because you know,
if you know,

2042
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:21,920
nobody else knows and you get to
be smarter than the plas instantly.

2043
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:27,140
And here's the other thing about
poker, and this is, you know,

2044
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:32,630
the reason of so many,
if there was 5%,

2045
02:02:32,631 --> 02:02:36,680
the amount of dead money suckers
and pool is there is in poker,

2046
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:40,220
we'd all, I mean, I'd be
driving a new car. Well,

2047
02:02:40,221 --> 02:02:44,990
the biggest suckers in pool are people
came over from poker who don't have any

2048
02:02:44,991 --> 02:02:49,250
appreciation for money because he used
to gambling big money, but, and poker,

2049
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:54,350
you've got a built in reason for losing
because you can make the dumbest,

2050
02:02:54,351 --> 02:02:59,351
stupidest plays in the world and still
feel okay because it wasn't your fault.

2051
02:02:59,571 --> 02:03:03,980
You got sucked out on. Why did that?
How, how's that donkey call my bet? Yup.

2052
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:08,840
You know, I've got, I mean you, if you
listen to poker players talk, it's crazy.

2053
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:12,770
Yeah. No one else on earth can play poker
except for that particular person. Well,

2054
02:03:12,771 --> 02:03:16,610
there's sometimes you hear that from
pool players that go, yeah, he got lucky.

2055
02:03:16,611 --> 02:03:20,660
He ran for you seven to the eight. It
bumps into the nine if you didn't bump it.

2056
02:03:20,670 --> 02:03:24,300
And I a lot of crying from pool
players, but nothing like poker. Right.

2057
02:03:24,710 --> 02:03:26,090
And the other thing is,

2058
02:03:26,091 --> 02:03:29,780
the biggest thing with poker
is Pittsburgh for example,

2059
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:35,360
I will never, ever, no matter what I do,
no matter how much effort I put into it,

2060
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,660
ever when the u s open
nine ball championship,

2061
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:44,180
I could play 15 hours a day for the
rest of my life. I'll never win it.

2062
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:46,100
It would be like me saying,

2063
02:03:46,101 --> 02:03:48,440
I'm going to win the heavyweight
championship of the UFC.

2064
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:51,410
It's fucking impossible.
It's not going to happen.

2065
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,420
But you could win the
world series of poker. Yes,

2066
02:03:54,350 --> 02:03:57,290
I have a legitimate shot just snapped.
And I mean, I mean, I'm not saying,

2067
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:00,710
I'm not saying a legitimate shot. I'm
saying it could happen. It's possible.

2068
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:05,270
It is possible. It's fucking
impossible. You might as well say,

2069
02:04:05,630 --> 02:04:10,220
I can win the UFC lightweight champion.
You know, it's fucking impossible.

2070
02:04:10,221 --> 02:04:14,270
Goal should be the wind, the women's
world championship. We should put,

2071
02:04:14,271 --> 02:04:17,830
that's your television show. That's your
television dress. That's yourself. Okay.

2072
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,430
Would hate me though.
They get mad at me.

2073
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:23,190
Joe Rogan takes on the world
of women of low.dot, dot.

2074
02:04:24,230 --> 02:04:29,220
In Pool Dot, dot, dot.
It'd be rude. No, I,

2075
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:32,660
I, I eventually want to do something
with pool, some sort of a show.

2076
02:04:32,661 --> 02:04:33,410
Figure out some sort.

2077
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:37,530
You know what I would really like to see
you do if for no other reason than just

2078
02:04:37,531 --> 02:04:42,480
pure self satisfaction is some kind
of really cool documentary. Yeah,

2079
02:04:42,481 --> 02:04:46,650
that'd be fun. Because one reason
and it's not, and once again, man,

2080
02:04:46,651 --> 02:04:47,550
I'm to the point,

2081
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:52,830
I'm just not a believer that pool
is a crossover to mainstream,

2082
02:04:53,810 --> 02:04:57,330
but as, but I don't think
it has to, but it has twice,

2083
02:04:57,510 --> 02:05:02,370
twice and two times because of the
media will tossler color mine. But now,

2084
02:05:02,371 --> 02:05:03,960
okay,
I agree with you 100%.

2085
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:08,580
So look at those two instances.
Yeah.

2086
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:12,690
Two Academy Award winning movies.
Both those movies won Academy Awards.

2087
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,560
Pretty crazy. Yes. So
both of those movies that,

2088
02:05:17,130 --> 02:05:19,950
so basically in order to
get mainstream acceptance,

2089
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:24,180
you have to have an academy award.
Winning movie, Jesus Christ.

2090
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:25,260
Wrap your head around that one.

2091
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:28,980
But here's my point is the
fact that you know what,

2092
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:33,120
it doesn't take that to improve
things for pool and everything else.

2093
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:38,010
I mean if you just get, you know,
100,000 more people playing,

2094
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:43,050
which sounds like a lot, but that's
shit. That's 200 people in every state.

2095
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:47,500
Yeah, we just need an ambassador. Yeah,
I'll take the reins. You could do that.

2096
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:50,450
I'll handle this pitch.
You could do it by checking on women.

2097
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:53,590
Now they just got to divide us people off.

2098
02:05:54,490 --> 02:05:58,890
It's weird too. Also, it's a,
it's an interesting argument
about the differences,

2099
02:05:59,170 --> 02:06:04,170
differences between men and women that
besides the cultural aspect of pool being

2100
02:06:04,331 --> 02:06:05,830
more acceptable for men to play,

2101
02:06:06,130 --> 02:06:10,930
there's actually a difference in the way
men and women see three d geometry the

2102
02:06:10,931 --> 02:06:15,400
way that may, the way men and women see a
spacial distance and their, their, their,

2103
02:06:15,401 --> 02:06:18,310
their, their understanding
of space. It's different.

2104
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:22,500
It's really interesting because a women
can get fantastic at pool. You know,

2105
02:06:22,510 --> 02:06:27,370
there's gene Valukas who competed against
men and jasmine ocean plays basically

2106
02:06:27,371 --> 02:06:29,290
like, you know, Allison Fisher. Please.

2107
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:33,920
I don't understand why.
I mean if you look at it on paper,

2108
02:06:34,730 --> 02:06:36,860
especially a game like straight pool,
right,

2109
02:06:37,030 --> 02:06:38,480
where it doesn't require the big break,

2110
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:41,780
there is no reason on
earth that I can think of.

2111
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:46,310
I mean physically, mentally you can
go into all that if you want to,

2112
02:06:46,670 --> 02:06:50,810
but physically there's no reason at all
that a man should be better than a woman.

2113
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,050
That's true.
But it also,

2114
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:57,160
it highlights the differences between
the way men and women look at three d

2115
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:58,420
space.
Okay.

2116
02:06:58,510 --> 02:07:03,160
We apparently have a different
need. There's, there's,

2117
02:07:03,161 --> 02:07:08,161
there's different requirements
for survival that a man
had of developing to this

2118
02:07:09,581 --> 02:07:11,860
point in 2013 from, you know, many,

2119
02:07:11,861 --> 02:07:15,250
many thousands of years of
evolution and women have,

2120
02:07:15,251 --> 02:07:18,820
they've had a different need
for fast twitch, muscle fiber,

2121
02:07:18,830 --> 02:07:20,620
a different need for reaction time.

2122
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:24,100
It's one of the arguments
against a male transvestite,

2123
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:28,720
a transsexual who used to be a male who
became a woman fighting females is the

2124
02:07:28,721 --> 02:07:32,740
reaction time. There's a weird reaction
time difference for men and women.

2125
02:07:32,741 --> 02:07:35,440
It's really significant.
It's about 10% Oh shit. Yeah.

2126
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:39,820
It's pretty much across the board.
So that's funny because yeah,

2127
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:42,280
shooting,
which you wouldn't think,

2128
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,400
I mean there's really no strength issue,
right?

2129
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:49,600
But the women aren't,
don't come close to the men.

2130
02:07:49,830 --> 02:07:51,450
Yeah.
Well Northern Cheyenne Pool,

2131
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:54,930
what was the last time a woman won a
world championship and pull the u s open

2132
02:07:54,931 --> 02:07:57,390
and he knows that they don't win them.
They don't win them.

2133
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:59,730
And there's an amazing,
amazing, amazing women.

2134
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:03,510
But what they are is so incredibly
exceptional that they stand out,

2135
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:06,320
but they still can't beat the best man.
They still can't be changed.

2136
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:09,460
They still can't beat Bustamonte.
No, there isn't. There isn't

2137
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:09,990
different.

2138
02:08:09,990 --> 02:08:14,130
And that's one of the things I like about
what I do with the people I do it with

2139
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:19,880
is it's interesting and
enjoyable to me to show,

2140
02:08:20,820 --> 02:08:25,410
uh, the levels because they're, you know,

2141
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:30,150
like we've done matches to where guys
play and you're sitting there and you're

2142
02:08:30,151 --> 02:08:34,860
going, you know what, if this
guy was playing Alex or shame,

2143
02:08:36,030 --> 02:08:40,110
he'd get beat 160. Right? Maybe. Right?

2144
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:43,980
But at the same time, the
guys playing great, right?

2145
02:08:44,150 --> 02:08:47,580
Yo guys playing great runout pool.
You'll not making mistakes,

2146
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,350
but it's like it makes it bad decision
here or he does something to get out of

2147
02:08:52,351 --> 02:08:55,710
line there and unless you really know
what the hell you're just going on,

2148
02:08:55,740 --> 02:09:00,330
it's hard to miss. But you know
when you see, I don't know,

2149
02:09:00,331 --> 02:09:02,580
it goes back to the excellence
thing I was talking about,

2150
02:09:03,150 --> 02:09:05,640
but like one of the things
that I'm really happy,

2151
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:09,450
you know when what I do is said and done,

2152
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,730
whatever that is, 25 years
from now, somewhere on youtube,

2153
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:20,780
someone will be able to flip on one
of these videos and watch and see.

2154
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:23,221
You know,

2155
02:09:23,221 --> 02:09:27,540
people always talk about how good and
Keith McCready was on a bar table in 1984

2156
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:29,333
you know what?

2157
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:34,340
Well people will be able to see how good
chain was on a nine foot 10 ball table

2158
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:37,060
and 2006

2159
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:41,440
or 2008 and 13 yeah. Right, exactly. Yeah.

2160
02:09:41,441 --> 02:09:45,250
That's unfortunate aspect to some of the
past players when they talk about it,

2161
02:09:45,251 --> 02:09:47,500
like there's like some
urban crane footage.

2162
02:09:47,501 --> 02:09:50,730
We see him playing straight pool
and you try to like put it together.

2163
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:53,320
Moscone there's a lot of footage
in Moscone when he was really old,

2164
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:55,540
unfortunately. You know, like those, uh,

2165
02:09:55,541 --> 02:09:58,240
those ABC wild world of
sports events that they had,

2166
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:01,510
they used to play pool on
ABC wide world cool ports.

2167
02:10:01,610 --> 02:10:04,750
But there was four channels
on television. Yeah. But it,

2168
02:10:04,751 --> 02:10:07,990
this is even more impressive. That pool
made it down to four channels. Well,

2169
02:10:07,991 --> 02:10:12,580
because of the story and I really think
that if pool has any shot at mainstream

2170
02:10:12,581 --> 02:10:17,050
television, it is a reality show type.
Totally didn't show you and May, dude,

2171
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:19,060
we're the last of the Mohicans.

2172
02:10:20,130 --> 02:10:24,240
You could absolutely.
I think you

2173
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:26,160
could do something. Yeah.
You know what I could do?

2174
02:10:26,161 --> 02:10:30,630
I could play really high level
women and the action report match,

2175
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:34,130
you know what you could do is you
could just could just make you into

2176
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,190
like the ultimate asshole.
No, you do it. It's just,

2177
02:10:37,191 --> 02:10:39,860
I mean we could just make you the bad
guy. I don't want to do that. Yeah,

2178
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:42,890
that'd be better than the
other way as I was nice.

2179
02:10:42,891 --> 02:10:47,530
I just play really good women kicked
her ass, cause I can't be in there, man.

2180
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:48,210
You can't.
You

2181
02:10:48,210 --> 02:10:50,570
can't be to any really good women.
None of them.

2182
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:55,430
I'm going to tell you five really
good one and you got no shot to beat.

2183
02:10:55,490 --> 02:10:58,930
Give me a year. Can't beat
Allison. You can't be serious big.

2184
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:03,710
Can I get crazy guy young?
You can't be all comedy knows.

2185
02:11:03,711 --> 02:11:07,760
Y'All are saying just fucking nine
ball and jasmine. None of them.

2186
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:11,090
I'm to bring somebody in.
That can be all the rest of things.

2187
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:15,340
All the rest of them.
A lot of how much of a drop off is there?

2188
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:20,240
Who I want to see you play? Who? Sarah
rousy. She's a really good player.

2189
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:23,120
He's a very good plan. Okay,
let's do it. Let's make it happen.

2190
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:25,790
I think Sarah would straight rob.
You straight rob me.

2191
02:11:26,310 --> 02:11:29,260
Someone's got to crush straight rod.
Someone's got a crush her as much,

2192
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:33,980
so there's my buddy. If I
start firing, man, we were in
nom together, but no Sarah,

2193
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:37,620
she hasn't played pool and like for you
to perfect. That's what I'm looking for.

2194
02:11:37,690 --> 02:11:42,650
Duck. Yeah. Listen man. I have gears and
on my highest gear, I surprised myself,

2195
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:47,090
but at my lowest gear, I'm not very
good at all. That's my real problem.

2196
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:51,620
You know, like remember what time you and
I were in Vegas from playing Eric? Yeah.

2197
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,520
I couldn't miss the ball.

2198
02:11:52,710 --> 02:11:57,110
She's running out packages over and
over and over again, but that's rare.

2199
02:11:57,140 --> 02:12:00,710
And then I have to get into the groove by
playing like six. Okay, six, seven hours.

2200
02:12:00,711 --> 02:12:04,070
I know exactly what the
hell are you talking about.
What do you think causes it?

2201
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:08,800
Uh, you get loose, you
understand exam. For me,

2202
02:12:08,980 --> 02:12:11,800
it's a matter of pool is all,

2203
02:12:11,801 --> 02:12:14,410
I mean I understand how the
stroke the ball correctly.

2204
02:12:14,590 --> 02:12:17,350
I understand how Stan correctly,
I understand how to aim correctly,

2205
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:22,330
but unless I'm playing consistently and
I have constant feedback loop between

2206
02:12:22,450 --> 02:12:24,610
qtip hitting the cue ball,

2207
02:12:24,611 --> 02:12:28,150
Cuba hitting the object ball and it goes
into my calculator of what's going to

2208
02:12:28,151 --> 02:12:28,984
happen,

2209
02:12:29,050 --> 02:12:33,310
I can fuck up and I can over juice
shots and I can have too much English.

2210
02:12:33,610 --> 02:12:38,610
It's a matter of a massive
amount of information coming
at me over a long period

2211
02:12:38,831 --> 02:12:39,521
of time.
Six,

2212
02:12:39,521 --> 02:12:43,690
seven hours of just playing pool know
us eating pizza and fucking drinking

2213
02:12:43,691 --> 02:12:46,570
coffee and then right back to the table.
And when I do that,

2214
02:12:46,870 --> 02:12:50,650
then especially that homeboys
place where that intense pasta,

2215
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:54,550
what's that fucking best billiards in
Vegas and amazing food that motherfucker

2216
02:12:54,551 --> 02:12:57,370
has. I heard the kitchen closed
down. It's not true for the herd.

2217
02:12:57,371 --> 02:12:59,290
I haven't been there since
last time we were there.

2218
02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:00,790
How dare he closed down the kitchen.

2219
02:13:01,090 --> 02:13:03,160
But when you do that for
a long period of time,

2220
02:13:03,190 --> 02:13:07,690
then I then I'm working with a massive
amount of information and when I'm

2221
02:13:07,691 --> 02:13:11,260
working with a massive
amount of information about
touch and feel and movement

2222
02:13:11,261 --> 02:13:14,950
and I get a sense of what's going
to happen, then I can get into it.

2223
02:13:15,130 --> 02:13:15,850
And once I get in,

2224
02:13:15,850 --> 02:13:18,370
does it anything like his
Jujitsu and very sad for you.

2225
02:13:18,430 --> 02:13:20,650
Very, very, very, very, very similar.

2226
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:23,830
It's all just a matter
of feel and movement and,

2227
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:26,680
and knowing what the feedback loop is.

2228
02:13:26,681 --> 02:13:29,200
Like if you've never punched somebody in
the, your punch someone and you're like,

2229
02:13:29,201 --> 02:13:31,720
whoa, this is crazy. But
then if you punch him a meal,

2230
02:13:31,721 --> 02:13:34,410
if you've used to punching people,
it just comes out. It's just,

2231
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:36,630
it just feels normal when
you're hitting someone.

2232
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:40,800
And I think with pool balls is the same
thing. The more you stroke that ball,

2233
02:13:40,801 --> 02:13:42,940
the more you understand the
movement and the more it it,

2234
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:47,730
it's in my head exactly how much effort
I have to exert to get exactly the same

2235
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:52,020
result on one ball and have balls
twist and turn and move. And that's,

2236
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:54,060
that's the big thing.
And for me also,

2237
02:13:54,061 --> 02:13:57,180
I'm so busy that I don't get
a chance to play that much.

2238
02:13:57,181 --> 02:13:58,220
So when I do get a chance,

2239
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:01,470
like when you and I are in Vegas
with Eric and we get like seven,

2240
02:14:01,471 --> 02:14:03,720
eight hours and we're playing
in a 24 hour pool hall,

2241
02:14:04,230 --> 02:14:07,920
I'm an enthusiastic as fuck. So
like five, six hours into this,

2242
02:14:07,921 --> 02:14:10,920
I haven't lost any enthusiasm. Sure.
I'm the loving the shit out of this,

2243
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:14,430
but I'm also getting excited and then
they start seeing Eric fall apart.

2244
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:18,480
When I started there, I shot it and
like predatory instinct kicks in.

2245
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:22,510
And then I'm a sneaky feeling.
You feel him with his cue.

2246
02:14:23,850 --> 02:14:26,670
It's like you get any nuts shot in with
your own cues sign. That's not good.

2247
02:14:26,671 --> 02:14:31,380
It's right. I see you over
there. No wobbling, wobbling
in the back of the herd.

2248
02:14:31,590 --> 02:14:32,423
I don't know man.

2249
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:35,850
There's very few things in life that
I've had as much of an attachment with

2250
02:14:35,851 --> 02:14:39,840
where I really like got a lot of
satisfaction out of like pool.

2251
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:43,470
So for me it's just a,
it's just fun. It's uh,

2252
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:46,530
and I'm not playing the person either.
I'm just playing those balls.

2253
02:14:46,531 --> 02:14:47,610
I'm just trying to do my best.

2254
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:52,020
I'm trying to do my best to making my
way around the table so I'm not upset if

2255
02:14:52,021 --> 02:14:54,720
someone wins. You know,
when I was a young man,

2256
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:56,610
if I was playing a game
when I was an idiot,

2257
02:14:56,970 --> 02:14:58,950
I would get upset if someone else one.

2258
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:02,040
And then I've realized somewhere along
the line that doesn't help me in any way.

2259
02:15:02,041 --> 02:15:05,610
And in fact it hurts me. But it's also
got nothing to do with you. Exactly.

2260
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:07,120
Especially with pool pools.

2261
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:10,440
One of the rare games where like
there's a famous match between Francisco

2262
02:15:10,441 --> 02:15:11,730
boosted and Johnny Archer.

2263
02:15:11,731 --> 02:15:14,100
They were playing a race at 10 for
some incredible amount of money.

2264
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:19,230
Johnny Archer broken ran 10 racks
in a row on him, which is insanity.

2265
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:20,430
And then at the end,

2266
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:24,050
Francisco Bustamonte want to double
the bet and keep it going. Right.

2267
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:29,160
That's how crazy it is a fucking game
is that a guy can do that with 10 games

2268
02:15:29,161 --> 02:15:30,270
you don't even get a chance to shoot.

2269
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:33,210
It's like the old joke about a guy,
he makes a game with the guy,

2270
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:37,320
they're going to gamble and uh,
the guy breaks and runs out the set.

2271
02:15:37,350 --> 02:15:40,020
The other guy never gets the play and
he comes up to him, he goes, hey man,

2272
02:15:40,021 --> 02:15:41,780
you're going to have to spot
me something cause spice.

2273
02:15:41,790 --> 02:15:43,650
I kind of spot you something
I haven't seen you play yet.

2274
02:15:45,590 --> 02:15:50,520
You know, so it's, well there's a thing
about pool and this is the big one.

2275
02:15:51,150 --> 02:15:55,920
Ended up with this. The thing about
pool that separates us from video game,

2276
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:57,300
not necessarily video games,

2277
02:15:57,301 --> 02:16:01,940
but really from poker is
execution exactly as they occur.

2278
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:04,110
You have to make a decision pool,

2279
02:16:04,111 --> 02:16:07,260
you have to make a decision and you have
to execute it and you have to keep your

2280
02:16:07,261 --> 02:16:08,850
nerves together.
You know,

2281
02:16:08,851 --> 02:16:11,460
if you've ever played in a
tournament or you ever gambled,

2282
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:16,320
you know how hard it is to really shoot
straight when your heart's pounding your

2283
02:16:16,321 --> 02:16:18,900
chest and a bunch of people are
watching you. Yeah. You know,

2284
02:16:18,901 --> 02:16:23,901
which is why you see a guy like Shane
or a guy like Alex or you know Earl when

2285
02:16:24,211 --> 02:16:28,150
they're playing their very best against
high level competition and then it ever

2286
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:32,640
fucking surrounded by people
who know how to play pool. Yeah.

2287
02:16:32,830 --> 02:16:33,880
Real pool players.

2288
02:16:33,881 --> 02:16:38,290
Like I could run out a rack and get
out and the average person is like,

2289
02:16:38,291 --> 02:16:40,630
that's incredible.
But you know someone like you is like,

2290
02:16:40,631 --> 02:16:43,930
why don't you go that way on the
sixth right. And like I fucked up man.

2291
02:16:43,931 --> 02:16:46,600
I just got lucky.
I pumped the eight and I got got clear.

2292
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:48,790
You will know that I fucked up.

2293
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:52,570
You will know that I got lucky and I got
out still. That happens all the time.

2294
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:53,613
Whereas a guy like

2295
02:16:53,720 --> 02:16:57,930
she's fucking see that if
he misses that five ball,

2296
02:16:57,931 --> 02:17:01,080
he doesn't even get out if he doesn't
clip the fire ball with his cue ball.

2297
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:06,570
He was playing luck. Pool playing wish
pool. We wish. Wish you add a shot. Huh?

2298
02:17:06,970 --> 02:17:09,880
There was a dude named
Tom, uh, um, uh, Mt.

2299
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:12,960
Vernon and Tommy and while we were at a
time, it was like a, a top player, uh,

2300
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:16,540
back at executive billiards where
I played in white plains, New York.

2301
02:17:16,541 --> 02:17:18,910
And he would get mad at people
when they play wishbone.

2302
02:17:19,050 --> 02:17:21,870
Wishful.
He's over here playing some old wish pool,

2303
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:25,930
some old wish pool.
You wish you got positioned?

2304
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:30,460
I learned a lot, man. Hanging out in
pool halls. I learned a lot of it.

2305
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:35,410
I learned a lot about life. I really did.
There's some extreme human beings. Yeah.

2306
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:39,790
And I'll tell you what
it will, uh, you know,

2307
02:17:39,791 --> 02:17:42,040
I've made my living in
that world for the last,

2308
02:17:42,041 --> 02:17:44,730
since 2007 and probably one of the

2309
02:17:44,780 --> 02:17:48,070
you guys outside of pool players
that actually can make a good living.

2310
02:17:48,450 --> 02:17:52,860
It's not good. Yeah. You got
to keep your place. I tell,

2311
02:17:52,861 --> 02:17:54,300
I tell people, you know, it's like,

2312
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:57,210
I feel like from just the
technical things I do,

2313
02:17:57,211 --> 02:18:01,350
I could go make more money
doing other things, but it's,

2314
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:05,790
I'm pretty confident in it.
But one of the things that,

2315
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:10,560
and I tell players this and
players have told me this, is that

2316
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:14,010
it's, it's, it's,

2317
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:18,780
it really means a lot to be able to
control your own destiny kind of.

2318
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:20,250
And that,
you know,

2319
02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:24,380
if I wake up in the morning
and I want to go do Xyz,

2320
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:30,180
I can do that with the knowledge that
I also have to have this done by this

2321
02:18:30,181 --> 02:18:34,800
time. It's like a lot of people who, who
do their own freelance type of stuff.

2322
02:18:34,810 --> 02:18:38,890
I mean, there's a lot of people out there
who do that, but, uh, you know, you,

2323
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:44,000
you give up security for
freedom and once you make that,

2324
02:18:44,701 --> 02:18:47,880
I mean, dude, you are a fucking
standup comic for how many years,

2325
02:18:48,450 --> 02:18:52,830
if anyone on earth understands that
it's you. Yeah. You know, I mean,

2326
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:55,860
before you got your break, what
were you making a night? You know,

2327
02:18:56,150 --> 02:19:00,150
it wasn't very much. Right.
But I mean it's, yeah,

2328
02:19:00,180 --> 02:19:03,060
and there's,
but that's the thing too is,

2329
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:07,350
you know,
if you want to go work a nine to five job,

2330
02:19:07,351 --> 02:19:10,170
you'll have a little more security.
Not much in this day and age,

2331
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:13,170
who was even more drastic
than comedy because, well,

2332
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:17,700
you can't go make money with
comedy. At least, you know,

2333
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:22,710
if you go show up, you're probably going
to get paid. Even if you suck with pool,

2334
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:27,440
you can go and you have to pay to go and
pool. Yeah, no, you have to be a room.

2335
02:19:27,470 --> 02:19:30,260
You have to pay for your tournament entry.
And if you don't perform,

2336
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:31,280
you don't get fucking paid.

2337
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:37,310
So pool is double tough for
players. It's very, very, very good.

2338
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:40,850
Listen man, after this podcast
is over, it's basically over.

2339
02:19:40,851 --> 02:19:43,760
Now let's wrap this bitch up. Let's
figure something out, man. Let's,

2340
02:19:43,761 --> 02:19:46,160
you and me do something. Let's do
something. We'll do it on the internet.

2341
02:19:46,161 --> 02:19:48,440
We'll do it somewhere.
It doesn't make something happen.

2342
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:53,300
See if we can see if we could
do something. Just get a
little fun in it. Maybe, uh,

2343
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:55,550
you know, maybe it's me
playing, maybe it's me.

2344
02:19:55,670 --> 02:19:58,370
Maybe it's you and I go into Derby
city and doing a a documentary.

2345
02:19:58,371 --> 02:20:00,230
I would love to do that.
I would love to do something.

2346
02:20:00,231 --> 02:20:04,820
We'll do something for sure. I just
podcast had no beginning, no end.

2347
02:20:04,821 --> 02:20:09,260
It has no end is a no point. But
that's life. Ladies and gentlemen, uh,

2348
02:20:09,261 --> 02:20:11,850
if you want to get ahold of Justin,
you can get ahold of him, uh,

2349
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:14,430
at the action report on Twitter.
Uh,

2350
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:18,980

where you could see the absolute,

2351
02:20:18,981 --> 02:20:23,540
very best players in the world.

2352
02:20:23,541 --> 02:20:27,470

that out. And if you're not a fan of pool,

fuck yourself. Go Fuck Yourself.
