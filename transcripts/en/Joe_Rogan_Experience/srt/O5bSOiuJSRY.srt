1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Casting you fuck,
you don't know what you're talking about.

2
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:07,170
Your stream is producers, not
the, not the best product,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,330
but it's free of shit has just as
good as like tri quarters like those,

4
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:15,210
those tri castors. So things are expensive
as shit. Everything on the Internet.

5
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,780
Now I bought a Garmin navigation anymore.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,500
You can download wave for free
and it's just as good when I yeah,

7
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,600
you can get a lot of free shit now.
That's just as good.

8
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:26,670
Like this pod cast bitches,

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,330
we ain't charging the Joe
Rogan experience, however,

10
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,510
is sponsored by some awesome companies.
But I'll tell you what,

11
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:37,140
we're not sponsored by Grillo's pickles.
It's past that shit over here.

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,630
All people say to me,
a QP took you to boot.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,680
Why is this okay? We've got a problem
here because I'm not seeing anything.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,230
Let me refresh this and see if
it shows where broadcasting,

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,160
but I'm not seeing it.
Oh, there's the image.

16
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:59,730
Okay. Um, Grillo's pickles is not
a sponsor. They're just nice guys.

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,010
We met them when I was doing
a zookeeper with Kevin James.

18
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:05,790
We were,

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,970
we were in the Commons and they had this
cart where they were selling pickles.

20
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,380
I'm like,
who the fuck is selling pickles?

21
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:12,870
Like what a weird thing to sell and I
thought they were going to be like those

22
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,070
seven 11 pickles.

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,820
You know you get them in a bag of
pickle juice and they're mildly good.

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,920
These things are fucking ridiculously
good. Yeah, they're fresh or hot.

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,660
They got car lucky. They have garlic in
them that you see like they have like,

26
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,580
look at this.
Can you see this online folks?

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,170
This is like fucking swamp grass in here.
See we,

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,610
these mother fuckers are doing
Voodoo with these pickles.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,760
This is big ass slices of garlic and
as big as slices of Haba narrows and

30
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:46,140
Jalapenos in there and then there's fresh
pickles and these mother fuckers are

31
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:50,500
ridiculous. No one's paying me for
this. This is 100% for bonanza for them.

32
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:54,990
It must be great. Josh Joel fucking
glove. I ate a whole container of these.

33
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:59,760
I panic when I get low and they send them
to you from Boston to me from Boston.

34
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:03,150
They ship them to me. Are panic
when I get low, I fucking panic.

35
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,160
They're the best fucking snack
ever. Guilt free. 100% guilt-free.

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,370
Yeah. Cause they're eating cucumbers.
The vegetables. I sit in front of the TV,

37
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,000
I fucking smack the fuck out
on these things and I don't,
I don't feel bad. Yeah.

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
Cause I'll fucking,

39
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,050
I'll down a whole bag of popcorn kettle
corn or I'll fuck up a whole bag of uh,

40
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,480
like cheesy popcorn,

41
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:28,320
popcorn with cheese on it or
potato chips with vinegar and salt.

42
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,760
I'll fuck up a whole bag and then I'll
feel like a loser and I'll wait an hour

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,970
and a half and I'll lift weights. I
will, I'm like, I can't be a pussy.

44
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:39,690
I can't just go to bed on that. Like a
fat slob cause that's step one to death.

45
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,140
So I'll make sure I do dead lifts and
an hour and a half when the potato chips

46
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,050
of have dropped down. Good
for you. But I eat these.

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,270
I don't feel guilty if you're in Boston,

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,150
you're first of all you're fucked because
it gets too cold there in the winter

49
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:53,280
and that Shit's ridiculous.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
And the women are to kind of tell
it to high school up there, man,

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,920
it's not the place. It's not the place.
It's beautiful place. I loved it,

52
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,960
but you know what?
It made me me.

53
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,900
I'm a wrestling and suck and weight in
that winter. Yeah. Oh, it was good times.

54
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,540
I did that as well. Walking around like
a rail in that, you know the zero. Yeah.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,170
Excuse me. I'm in the middle
of a podcast. My kids,

56
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,440
ladies and gentleman,
this is why I have to get a studio.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
This is why my kids are crazy.

58
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,650
The shine the children in
the background is fantastic.

59
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,400
There's always like a new home or just
say, this is not really an emergency.

60
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,930
My dollies, I fell off. We're
going to have to glue it back on.

61
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:32,800
Is it going to be okay? I'm pretty sure
we can glue. It becomes a huge issue.

62
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,230
I have. I have fake tea
every, every morning now.

63
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,220
Tea Parties or parties
yesterday with both of them.

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,860
My daughter's got to milk the cow to
actually drink it too. You have to do it.

65
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,320
I have to blow on it first. I'm like,
God, I gotta go. She's like, wait,

66
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,230
you have to blow my, come on. Yeah, but
it's important to play with the man.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,500
I enjoy. Well, let's get to it
through the fucking podcast first.

68
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,020
This is not a commercial. Okay.
We'll put this as a commercial.

69
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,160
The Grillo's pickles things.

70
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,910
This is 100% for free just because I
love them and their pickles are fucking

71
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,520
fantastic and the nice people.
Anyway,

72
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,880
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is
actually sponsored. Where's that phone?

73
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:10,840
Give me that phone man.
Oh, Samsung Galaxy three.

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,940
I got a galaxy three from teen and this
is going to be one of our new sponsors.

75
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,950
They, uh, they run 10 runs on the
Verizon or the sprint network rather.

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,310
So they have excellent service
and there's no contracts and,

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,450
and they have some dope phones,
including the Samsung Galaxy three.

78
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,360
So what does ting ting is
out a new mobile company.

79
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:36,110
It's like there's alternative routes.
They rent space on a sprint. The way,

80
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:36,470
I don't,

81
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,820
I don't want to speak out of school
because I haven't read their literature.

82
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,250
But essentially what it is is
they run on the sprint network,

83
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:46,270
they rent the sprint network, but they
take a different wrist in sprint does.

84
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,820
They, they rent a service and
they say, listen, you know,

85
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,430
we'll charge you by what you use.

86
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,180
You can quit when you want and you're,
you have no contract.

87
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,110
So it's a way like better deal
for someone who doesn't, you know,

88
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,350
you might try this and go, you know,
when a fuck droids I need an iPhone,

89
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,750
I've got to get to at t and
t I got to quit. If you quit,

90
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,170
you don't have to worry about like losing,
you know,

91
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,320
like a ton of money or having to
pay some contract breaking fee.

92
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,700
And if you use less on one month,

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,610
you actually get credit for it
on the next month. So yeah, it's,

94
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,300
it's a really good company.
It's a good deal. And you know,

95
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,370
cause they're on sprint,
it'll be good service,

96
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,350
but that they're not an
official sponsor yet.

97
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,870
So this is another non
commercial commercial.

98
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,610
But I finally got ahold of one of these
Samsung Galaxy threes. I had that there.

99
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,000
There was good as it gets. Yeah, it's
supposed to be like a giant iPhone.

100
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,820
I need to find out. You know what,
the operating system, just like,

101
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:42,610
I need to read band hates these
fucking things, but does he,

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,620
he doesn't like droids
there's and believe in him,

103
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,410
but to me it's just computer
people are really into that.

104
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,150
They fall into different camps.
Apples, you only way they get crazy.

105
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,550
Well you want to get an apple, get a piece
of shit. I stick with Dell. You're like,

106
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,340
God, I'm not in your ward dude.
I have no dog in that fight.

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,490
He says blankety weird
statements. He like, okay,

108
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm into guys fucking dummy dumped dumb.

109
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,180
We are actually legitimately sponsored,
only buy on it.

110
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,240
That's o n n I t and a on as a company
that provides me with a alpha brain.

111
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,650
And um, I uh, I'm a part
owner in the company when,

112
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,860
so when you support on it, you actually
support this podcast and support me.

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,210
Why did I become a part owner? Because
I 100% believe in what they're doing.

114
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,040
The ethics are absolutely perfect.

115
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,940
What they're trying to do is sell you
the best shit possible for the lowest

116
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:42,941
price point and make it as clean as
possible so that no one feels ripped off.

117
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:47,030
So when you buy 30 pills,
there is a 100% money back guarantee.

118
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,000
You don't even have to return the
product. You just go, this isn't for me.

119
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,240
I've read things online by intelligent
people that are claiming that it's a

120
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:57,620
placebo. I don't know how everybody's
body works. Everybody's different.

121
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:02,621
Everybody's body has a different reaction
to caffeine and alcohol and cigarettes

122
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,590
and vitamins. I don't
know. Yeah, we'd for sure.

123
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,240
I don't know how your
body reacts to things,

124
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,460
but what I do know is that all of the
nutrients inside of Alpha brain have been

125
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:18,230
proven to have a positive effect
on human cognitive function.

126
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,270
And there are studies behind that,

127
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:24,080
and we're actually putting together
our own study. It's about to go live.

128
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,820
We've established a protocol and it will
be a double blind placebo study at a

129
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:33,640
legitimate university to show
everyone that there is a, uh,

130
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,330
a noticeable measurable benefit and
taking nutrients. I 100% believe this.

131
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,230
I've been a big fan of vitamins for a
long time. I'm very sensitive to my body,

132
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,630
especially when apples touch yourself.
Very sensitive to my body. Um,

133
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,660
I know when I smell, I know when I
feel good. I know the difference.

134
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,040
When I take fish oil and I don't fish.
Take Vishal,

135
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,740
I always talk about this for Jujitsu,
if you take Jujitsu,

136
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,390
there's two things that are musts,
acid office and fish oil, acidophilus,

137
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,880
healthy bacteria,
very important case staff away.

138
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,860
So important ringworm everything and
colds as well because when you come in

139
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,240
contact with colds, a lot of it is
through your hands touching things. Well,

140
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,470
what as a dot Phyllis is,

141
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:17,450
is this yeast and milk culture is
a very aggressive culture and it's,

142
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:21,170
it's a mutually compatible with your body
so you can take it and you're fine and

143
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:25,250
it's all over your skin. Well when it
comes in contact with some, some bugs,

144
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
it just gangs up on,
it beats the fuck out of the disease.

145
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,370
It's like having an army.
It's like having a healthy army.

146
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:33,530
That Kombucha that you
grab from my fridge, I,

147
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:37,460
you never find my fridge unless it's got
combustion. It's never not stocked with.

148
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,990
It's got great. It's got a
mushroom bacteria. Yes. It's,

149
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,250
it's got healthy things that
you take in your body. Well,

150
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:47,900
we have to realize that our bodies
are not just your body. It's not just,

151
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:51,570
you know, hey, I'm Brian Kelly and
this is in my blood and my wall. Yeah.

152
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,060
There's a lot of stuff in there.

153
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:56,400
And the other thing that they are
finding is that essentially your body is,

154
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,550
is like almost like an
ecosystem in its own with,

155
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,680
it's made up mostly of organisms,

156
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,850
most microbes and good
bacteria and bad bacteria.

157
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:10,380
And when you keep the balance
of bad bacteria in relation
to the good versus the

158
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:13,370
bad, that's how you maintain
good health. Absolutely.

159
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,460
And Science and a lot of scientists now
are working on cultivating the bacteria

160
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,470
in your body so that you have,
you know,

161
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,760
only good bacteria or you manage it
accordingly and that's the future in some

162
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,000
circles of, of, of how you're going
to be even healthier in the future.

163
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,770
What we're trying to provide it on it is
all things that have a positive effect

164
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,010
on the human body.
All of our supplements like Alpha brain,

165
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,600
shroom tech is another one.

166
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:40,740
Shroom tech is based on the quarter subs
mushroom and which has been shown to

167
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:44,190
have a positive effect on your
ability to simulate oxygen.

168
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,750
And this was actually discovered by high
altitude herders. They found that there,

169
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,230
yeah,

170
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,230
that their animals were
eating these mushrooms and
they were having more energy,

171
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,120
that we're moving around more and
there was a noticeable difference.

172
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:59,940
So they started eating them. Yeah.
And their, the way they grow them,

173
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:03,930
it's fucking crazy. It's a fungus. They
actually have to grow it on caterpillars.

174
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,470
It's insane. It's insane. It's a,

175
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:11,700
it's weird and it's really
hard to cultivate and it's
really fucking expensive.

176
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,600
But if you use a code name, Rogan, you
get 10% off any and all the supplements,

177
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,430
everything we sell you is the
best shit you can buy everything.

178
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,570
It might not be the cheapest,

179
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,990
but it's the cheapest we can sell
it and it's the best shit possible.

180
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,520
Like hemp force protein,

181
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,880
hemp protein is the easiest
protein for your body to digest.

182
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:33,120
It's much easier than whey
protein. I like way, you know,

183
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,740
I love like muscle milk
and stuff like that,

184
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:38,600
but it fucking lights my asshole up
like a canon. It's got a lot. I, I,

185
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,530
it's hard to digest. Sometimes way is a,
it's, it's not as nearly as easy as hemp.

186
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,530
And there's some good hemp,
there's like Manitoba Harvest.

187
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:48,900
I've used that stuff before
that's like a chocolate ham,

188
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,100
but it cannot fuck with him. Force
him. Force tastes so much better.

189
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,450
And one of the reasons is because
we use the best quality hemp hearts.

190
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:59,880
We use hemp hearts.
The best quality you can get.

191
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,900
It's so hard to get that you can
only buy 50 pounds of it a day.

192
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,260
So we have to put a new order in
every day because he's hemp hearts.

193
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:11,850
We can't grow them in America
because of this contin government.

194
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,580
And even though Vermont and two
other states have passed laws,

195
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,840
allowing them to grow the non
psychoactive at all, I won't allow,

196
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,090
the federal government said they would
come in and arrest people and ignore

197
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,060
unequivocal terms.
We'll know what clearly they said clearly.

198
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,250
They said they would put people in jail.
It's fucking horrible.

199
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,570
It's horrible to think about that.

200
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,570
The you would arrest someone for growing
as a client to be involved in enforcing.

201
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,960
Exactly. So the marijuana laws
have nothing to do with hemp,

202
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,570
which is really crazy because you
literally can't get high off him.

203
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,330
That's another thing that people get
up. Keep asking me. If you eat this,

204
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:45,780
a hemp force, am I going to test
positive for THC at work? No. No,

205
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:49,200
you absolutely will not. However,
if you eat a poppy seed Bagel,

206
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,910
you'll test positive for heroin something
a lot of times, I don't know. Oh,

207
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,110
100% and that's what I tell about
Olympic athletes and stuff. Yeah,

208
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,170
well that's happened to people that
have had a heroin tests at work.

209
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,300
This happened to people who eat
a lot of poppy seed bangles.

210
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,260
You test positive for the same metabolite.
Um,

211
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,480
so you don't have to worry about that
with hemp force, which is so crazy.

212
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,460
We have to buy this
shit in another country.

213
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,540
We would on it would be
willing to grow it in America,

214
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,550
hire American farmers to grow it and,

215
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,690
and give people jobs and help
the American economy. But no,

216
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:24,691
this and government with its horrible
corruption and deep rooted ties to

217
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:29,290
pharmaceutical companies literally won't
even let anything close to marijuana.

218
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,170
And if you want to read it,

219
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,860
how closely tied they are to
the pharmaceutical companies.

220
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,280
Pick up a book called the China
study by t Colin Campbell,

221
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,580
a phd who was on the inside of,
of,

222
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,890
of all this stuff and was on the national
board of scientists. And it is a,

223
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,450
he's a nutritional scientist
out of Cornell University.

224
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,940
It is a fascinating book,

225
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:53,320
an expo say on how industry has
hijacked skus than how you eat.

226
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,010
Why the school lunch program? 28
million counting children. Uh,

227
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,410
eat what the dairy industry,

228
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,740
the meat industry and the sugar lobby
wants them to eat cause it's big business

229
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,340
and why children are suffering from
diabetes and a host of other chronic

230
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,710
illnesses.
Don't take my word for it.

231
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,300
Look at a credible scientist and
real data to support what I'm saying.

232
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,560
It is fascinating.

233
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:18,010
This is a guy on the inside who knows all
the scientists in the academics who've

234
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:19,230
been, who've been, who,

235
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,080
who can take money from the same
corporation they're doing research for.

236
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,100
The point is we're on a fucking pirate
ship. So that's why hemp is expensive.

237
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,970
It's the really the only reason it's a,

238
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,810
it's a high quality food that we should
be able to grow and grow in this country.

239
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,260
We also sell, we just started
selling exercise equipment. Oh, hemp.

240
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,020
Hemp force also has maca
in it and raw cocoa.

241
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:43,021
Raw Cocoa is a very powerful antioxidant
and Maca is a stimulates testosterone

242
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:49,351
growth son gets that libido on
kid just tossed around as a band.

243
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,210
Yeah, it's going to be banned
eventually. They're gonna want,

244
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,800
they're gonna want the
world filled with pussy.

245
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,820
Do you really want horny men
running through your neighborhood?

246
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,570
You've never worked on a little dude.

247
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,390
We're going to have to be talk about
this as soon as this commercial's over

248
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,030
kettlebells. That's what I'm
all about, ladies and gentlemen.

249
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,470
And we sell a host of kettlebells in
packages at [inaudible] dot com and again,

250
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,320
these bitches aren't cheap,
but they're the best quality.

251
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,120
You can get as cheap as we can sell them.

252
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,970
They are essentially canon
balls with handles on them.

253
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:19,390
They're fucking fantastic
there. Troy. Kettle bells,

254
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,180
they're the best we could buy.
They have the perfect dimensions there.

255
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:25,330
They're fucking so durable.

256
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,720
You buy them once you have
exercise equipment for life,

257
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,690
they literally are a lifelong tool.

258
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:36,430
They will never break their fucking
iron cannon ball with a handle on it.

259
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,060
Where is it? It's nice to get
a kettle ball exercises online.

260
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,630
Youtube is the best free.
Youtube is free. We're going to,

261
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,950
we're making a Kettlebell DVD that you
could work out along with me with Steve

262
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,280
Maxwell Cause uh, Steve Maxwell who was
a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu, uh,

263
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,240
as well as a, um, uh,

264
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,620
like world renowned Kettle Bell Instructor
and fitness instructor and just a

265
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:58,431
brilliant guy.

266
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,430
I love having conversations with them
about fitness because I always learned

267
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:02,240
something new.

268
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
I've been working with him for years and
we make little videos on my cell phone.

269
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,130
I can show me the exercise and we'll do
a video. Like he, he, he got me through,

270
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:13,070
he's got like a bunch of exercises
that he's programmed for me.

271
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:16,490
One of them was just a full body weight
exercise routine where I did nothing but

272
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:20,360
body weight. It's something I could do
in a hotel with a towel over a door.

273
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,800
Like he's really into like that.
You can,

274
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,110
you can do a full workout and it's a
brutal bodyweight workout. It's fucking,

275
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:27,291
you know,

276
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:31,400
one legged squats and shit like that
and one arm pushups and crazy shit. Oh,

277
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:34,130
Hindu pushups, Hindu
squats. And it's a ruthless,

278
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:37,460
ruthless workout that you could do
in a little room, you know, push,

279
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,000
push a chair to the side and you've
got a gym in your hotel room to kill

280
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:41,690
yourself actually.

281
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,550
So we're going to make d DVDs and a
and have them also for sale and on it.

282
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:49,610
So Steve Maxwell's in which
I'm very excited about
because I wanted to make sure

283
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:53,390
that if I'm doing a video, I don't
want to fuck anything. Buddies backup.

284
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,090
I want us to shut up,
fucking do everything wrong,

285
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,340

you know, so, uh, we'll have that soon.

286
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,310

304
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:59,520
short neck and a wide
face and very expressive,

305
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,700
very expressive eyes.

306
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,080
He's gonna go home moms short legs and um,

307
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,330

extremities when they more at home on a

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,010
He's got the best damn podcast.
Thank you very much.

314
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,640
Everybody know if I should
help you and it, that's how I,

315
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,840
that's how I had that. It's
emotional. It's all, I can't you guys.

316
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,690
Maybe I'll add some more verses,
but that's all I've got for now.

317
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,010
I was a shambles.
That stupid song in the shower.

318
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,360
You sing that song? I was
like, yeah, I was a while.

319
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,330
When I woke up the morning I was like, I'm
bored. And I was like, in June he goes,

320
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,080
mom, friend, his name was Joe Rogan
and I started breaking down your body.

321
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,600
You might have like the worst sense
of beat and rhythm ever do it.

322
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,170
I'm the terrible thing is you're
talking about, I have no words.

323
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,610
I am the police. How many police
put that to music so I can,

324
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,370
so I can just revel in,
play it on a loop in my car.

325
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,950
I would be a terrible musician,
dude.

326
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:19,260
Why are we thinking about my body
when you by yourself. That's crazy.

327
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,230
I was soaking myself down. Yeah. And
I was touching myself. I don't know.

328
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:25,080
It makes me feel weird. Mixed feeling.
I was feeling I wanted to be as thick.

329
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:26,660
And why didn't you know?
Really? How about it?

330
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,970
He stuck in why I can't go north to south.

331
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,980
So I go east to west here thing.

332
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,850
I'm meant to be carrying bricks and
pills. You were always, yeah. Yeah.

333
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:38,570
This is thinking about you.
Even when I'm back in the day,

334
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,230
you were always working out and you had
just, you had big hands, big hands, long.

335
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:47,340
Your arms are long. Legs are short, arms
are long. Well, my legs aren't short.

336
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:51,390
My upper body short. Oh, that's
okay. It's actually, yeah,

337
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,610
very weird. Yeah. It's built
to bear to Harry rocks.

338
00:18:56,611 --> 00:19:00,480
Up Hills. Sicilian stone masons have
to say, and what happened to me,

339
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,190
I'm built for dance.
Some of these trucks,

340
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,890
all the rocks and I'm built
for dance fucking employees.

341
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm built to gesture and emote.
Well,

342
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,320
that's one of the things I
think I like about kettle bells.

343
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,700
I feel like I'm working hard.
I just

344
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,780
put in a fucking hard kettlebell
workout, man. It's like you're, you know,

345
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:21,420
you're really going to war.
You're fighting something.

346
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,490
It's not just like doing a bench. I've
never done a really hard kettlebell work,

347
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:27,900
but maybe you'll take me through. How
dare you. You're in my house. Yeah.

348
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:31,500
Maybe I'll take before I feed you the
grass fed steaks that I got some grass fed

349
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:32,670
steaks.
You to a high right now,

350
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,650
but we'll do it after a
little too high to workout.

351
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,070
It's the best time to work
out. Fuck yeah, I don't smoke.

352
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,290
You don't smoke enough wheat.
That's the problem.

353
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,330
You've got to get
comfortable with the waves.

354
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,540
It's like if you don't know how to surf
and you get on a board in the wave hits

355
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,440
you, you're going to fall on your
ass. Why? And you're like, no, no, no.

356
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,030
You just don't know how
to handle the wave yet.

357
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,650
You've got to learn how to ride the
weed waves the whole life. Someone's,

358
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,780
when someone's high all the time,
they can just handle being high.

359
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,680
They can handle being hot,

360
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:02,100
talking to a cop and then he ended up
being high buying tickets at the movie

361
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:06,630
theater. They're used to the boat they
used to the front of the waves. Man,

362
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,900
these that experience, I like that
you lift weights when you're high,

363
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:14,510
you feel your muscles may fuel your
tissue. You do feel way more intense.

364
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,860
Everything pops stretches better.

365
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:20,140
It feels great when you
stretch high stretching highs.

366
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:22,350
It's like when you were all
high two letters. Oh yeah.

367
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,300
I do Jujitsu high all the time.
Whenever you gave me,

368
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,820
I feel I have good energy right now.
Sativa.

369
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,090
It's called sage cities
sativa, Sativa. It's uh,

370
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,450
it's all um, positive and
energetic. It's not like a,

371
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,430
I've never done standup.
Highlight this. Yes, you have.

372
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,040
We got your high ones before I
show. That's true. Oh, that's right.

373
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,210
That was fucking,
that's right.

374
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,830
That was at the Ice House and I started
talking about saving a baby that was

375
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,800
trapped under a smart car show,
Shanghai before every show. Man.

376
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,330
For real fuck around. Why fuck
around lately on stage, I've been,

377
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,500
I don't know if this ever happens to you,

378
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:00,220
but I'll get up like just a winkling have
an idea and I just start following it

379
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:04,120
on stage and sometimes it just starts
forming itself. Other times you're like,

380
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,060
where am I going? What are you doing
this weekend? You got gigs? Yeah.

381
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:08,930
I'm going to be in a, actually,
I'm glad you remind me.

382
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:13,931
I'll be in Vegas at the Paris at the
Paris was a great new room and I'll be

383
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:17,130
there Thursday, Friday, Saturday
come out, it's court court,

384
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:20,590
Mcfarland's Corp and gallons place
and quarter Paris and it's great.

385
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,040
And the court will be middling
for me and I can't wait man.

386
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,330
I had a great time in Schaumburg.

387
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,870
Thanks everybody is Schomburg and thanks
to Joe Rogan because a lot of people

388
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,770
came out because they listen to this and
um, it was, it was, it was amazing, man.

389
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,300
I love, I love those crowds. I love
that room is great room. I love Chicago.

390
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:40,870
There's so nice. Yeah, they're
great. They're just polite
people. They're better.

391
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,820
They're better than us. I love the
way you said that you looked down.

392
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,790
Now they're better than us. They are
better than us. They're real people.

393
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,810
They have to deal with this all winter,
which soft, softer on the belly.

394
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,040
There's something to be said about, about
having to deal with the winter. They,

395
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,340
they say that the, the, the people
in the north developed faster and,

396
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,410
and technologically because they had to
get ready for the winter because they,

397
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,740
the winner was something you
had to develop a sense of time.

398
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,350
You have to figure out how to harvest
store food and all the things that come

399
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:09,070
with that.

400
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,760
And it required a higher level of
technology and a higher level of sort of

401
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,500
planning and, and, and
in some ways, uh, uh, uh,

402
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,220
discipline because criminals are
way smarter on the East Coast. Yeah.

403
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,210
Well they're organized.

404
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,270
It's called the mafia because
those aren't the smart ones.

405
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,730
The Russians are the smart ones. The
Russians, Chinese, you don't know. Yeah.

406
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,870
The Russians and the Chinese
keep their fucking miles calls.

407
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:35,320
The Italians start reality
shows like mob wives.

408
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,540
You imagine if a Russian
chick tried to start a mob,

409
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,180
wives show they would kill that bitch.

410
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,240
But these weak ass guineas are letting
these fucking dumb broads go on TV and

411
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:45,670
spelled all their nonsense,

412
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,550
basically indicting them
when an entire life of crime.

413
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,030
You know what you're getting into when
you entering this life. Oh really?

414
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:55,390
So you're admitting your husband's a
fucking criminal on TV. You dumb cunt.

415
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,320
Is that what you're doing?
What you're doing?

416
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,150
I don't want to you if you are
in a criminal empire, okay.

417
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,410
If you're involved in something like that,

418
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,380
you can't go on a reality show
and just make light of it.

419
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:09,790
Like it's no big deal to be fucking mob
wife because I guarantee you there's

420
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:13,600
some shit in that guy's past that
he's denied and then he would say,

421
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,700
none of them.
I'm not a lifetime criminal and this,

422
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,450
you got a wife on TV to your real guy.
You're a real mafia guy.

423
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,660
Your wife doesn't know a damn thing.
They found, they found the Chinese,

424
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:23,770
the head of the Chinese triads,

425
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:28,330
they said in New York and you know what
he'd been doing for 15 years selling, uh,

426
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,470
so that at one of those pushcarts
Jesus Christ, that was his cover.

427
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,940
She's squaring off that they're willing
to take it to the sodas. Not fucking,

428
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:39,610
it's warm. Gimme Your fucking
mic. Cold Soda. Let's go.

429
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:42,510
He's the head of a try and he was dealing
with that everyday. That's hilarious.

430
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,940
Ran The triad when they had that
whole Gadi thing going on in New York.

431
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,770
I remember going, what is going on?
They can't arrest the mafia guy.

432
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,830
Like this main montage, the
Teflon. Don, where's this?

433
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,320
I remember thinking like met and spent
a lot of time with his lawyer. Really?

434
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,010
What's his name? Can't remember his
name now. It's make this buffer,

435
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,370
buffer counselor, counselor,
counselor, something like Katar.

436
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,150
No, what other Bruce Cutler.
Cutler maybe. Anyway,

437
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:14,780
he looks like a big gorilla. I thought
he was an Italian guy. He was Jewish.

438
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm Jewish. I'm from Brooklyn. I don't
believe in violence, but I was a wrestler.

439
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:19,370
He was a wrestler and he never lost,
he said,

440
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:23,180
but he was at really great guy and Oh,
what is his name? What is his name?

441
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,730
We got to Google. Okay. Um,

442
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,740
but he was such a good guy and we
had so much fun and I'm really it.

443
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,760
Bruce Cutler or Bruce? I don't
remember. Uh, yeah, he's a great guy.

444
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:37,970
He's got a great sense
of humor. Um, and, uh,

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,100
and he was just talking about
how defending somebody, you know,

446
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,470
is that they're going to send you
with for a thousand years. I'm,

447
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:46,230
I'm going to defend you. I'm going to
do everything I can. And uh, you know,

448
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,820
but he says it. He said, yeah,
Bruce Cutler, we said about
God, he said, he said, I've,

449
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,900
I've, I've, uh,

450
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,760
I have defended some very formidable
men and that is the one guy who really

451
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,800
lived what he spoke,
what he said. You know,

452
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,820
I was into ever tell you the story
about being in little Italy in 91,

453
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:05,420
let's call it, and uh, it might even
be, yeah, something like that. It was,

454
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:10,180
I think it was even met 90, and it
was early and I was at, and he had a,

455
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,030
I can't remember the
name of his social club,

456
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:15,290
but it was right near a
restaurant called Cafe Sorrento.

457
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,610
And we used to go there and right next
door was the social club. Oh, come on,

458
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:24,200
what's called mall. And I'll never
forget, and that's where God,

459
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:25,610
he and his boys used to hang out.

460
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,150
And you'd see these just rough
looking dudes with earpieces and,

461
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,490
and they'd stayed,
the car would pull up and stuff.

462
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:35,270
And I remember I was eating and the
outdoor cafe was with this girl and I saw

463
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:38,780
these two dudes in suits with open shirts,
raven,

464
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,520
Raven night shows and,
and Catholics went to was right next door.

465
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,300
And I remember seeing,
um,

466
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:50,350
these two just giant men walking
out on their way clearly to do,

467
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:55,430
I could smell it, I could see
it clearly to do something bad,

468
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,050
clearly do something like,
you know,

469
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,710
and I remember looking at how big and
formidable they were and how they were

470
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:02,630
basically professional
knuckle knuckle breakers.

471
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,890
And I thought to myself that that would
put the fear of God in you, that that's,

472
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,870
you better be ready for guys
who are going to, you know,

473
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,280
because the cops are gonna come and then
they're going to grow and those guys

474
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,710
are going to wait. They're going
to come back. That's right.

475
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,580
That's what their job is to get that
done. That's right. They go like this,

476
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:21,740
they go, hello and I
say, have a good evening.

477
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,920
And then they come back and the whole
place is burned down. See you soon.

478
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,380
Fuckface Susan Saturday and
mother for me. Right. Yeah.

479
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,290
It's a very scary thing to
have. Uh, organized crime.

480
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,480
Well corporations in technology
actually actually um,

481
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,200
took a big bite out of organized crime.

482
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,540
Couldn't shake down local businesses
anymore cause they weren't,

483
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,550
they were all cs and things.
It's interesting,

484
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,300
the Raven Night Social Club is now
a shoe store. Oh Wow. Yep. Wow.

485
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,450
It's shoes and purse and the, and the way
they brought down, brought down, got it.

486
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,293
Ever hear the story.

487
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,800
The guy who used to run the Raven night
social club managed it and he was the

488
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,810
guy who took care of cleaning the tables.
Everything else.

489
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,140
They send a cop in there. This
beautiful woman, she was a cop.

490
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,200
She banged them on the
table and as he was having,

491
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:02,400
as he was banging on the table,

492
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:07,230
she put a mic under the table
and that's how, and that,

493
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,770
that is how she took one.
She took one for the team,

494
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,340
took some fos guy,
took some cock bang,

495
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,890
put it under there and grouper
brought the whole thing down.

496
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,110
I wonder if she came.
That's a good question.

497
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,890
One of she was like so like
turned on by the fucking scandal.

498
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,850
She was a sexual patriot.
Wow. And absent she'll,

499
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,050
patriot is a new distinction there it is.

500
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,720
I've never heard of a sexual patriot
before. Oh by the way everybody,

501
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,860
thank you for making man thoughts with
Brian Cowen number nine yesterday.

502
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,600
Thanks to the Joe Rogan podcast.

503
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:39,270
Cause I know a lot of you guys are
just going over from here to there.

504
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,920
I mean that's Kinda crazy but love you.

505
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,900
I started talking about
the 10 minute podcasts.

506
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:47,640
I started talking about my
podcast the next day, the
next day. He's like, dude, my,

507
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,850
my, my, my buddy was like, you're
number 13 dude on iTunes. I was like,

508
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:54,300
have you ever seen the youtube comments
whenever we request people to go look at

509
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:58,980
a video? No. It's hilariously whatever.

510
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,360
Like, I've recommended like an
Allman brothers song the other day,

511
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,950
and you go to the song now
and for the first three pages,

512
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:11,130
it's just says like powerful Joe Rogan,
uh,

513
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,570
all of garden butthole. That's
awesome. Yeah, it's hilarious.

514
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,940
Joe Rogan sent me. Yeah, it's ridiculous.
What, what do you think is the, well,

515
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,080
I mean, your podcast is to become
a bit of a phenomenon and you know,

516
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,960
as long as I've known you,

517
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:28,050
the one thing I know about you
is that you've never ever lied.

518
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,210
You're just an authentic dude and you, for
better, for worse, for better, for worse,

519
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,120
you were always the guy. And when you
were young, it was so inconvenient.

520
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,730
If you didn't like somebody at
that, in that circle, you'd be like,

521
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,910
I don't know if I'm like, you, I
like it. So there it is. I mean,

522
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:42,780
it was basically that,

523
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:45,780
are they figured out real quick that
you just had a problem with you?

524
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:50,400
We're willing to tolerate some really
ridiculous people in your life. And, uh,

525
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:54,150
I loved you and I'd be hanging around
with you and I'd see all these problems in

526
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:54,984
your life.

527
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,410
And it drove me crazy because it wasn't
just that I didn't like this guy.

528
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,850
I was mad that this guy was
wasting your time with nonsense,

529
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:07,851
these idiots and liars and frauds and
dummies and you didn't want to hurt their

530
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:11,340
feelings. So you accommodated them.
It's right and I was offended.

531
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,580
I was offended by them.
I was offended by them for being so weak.

532
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,820
The run this week game and then you were
accepting this week game so they didn't

533
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:18,400
grow.
Do you know,

534
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,580
do you know a lot of young people
listen to this and one of we know what I

535
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:23,070
figured out after a while and why don't,
why don't do that anymore?

536
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,880
Why don't suffer fools
anymore is because when you,

537
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,590
when you suffer fools like that,

538
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:33,591
what you're doing is actually taking
your time away from and from real people.

539
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,980
People's do design at the time.
Exactly. You know who are not imposters.

540
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,870
It's not good for them either.
The fools.

541
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,400
If you let a fool before they have to be
a four by saying that you know the, the,

542
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:46,840
that's who they are and you just accept
that they're never going to grow.

543
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,220
And I don't know if they can grow.

544
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,810
I don't know what their
potential for growth is,

545
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:51,850
but we're not going to fucking
find out if you tolerate them.

546
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,010
You can't do it because you
lose all your energy. It takes,

547
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,570
it's actually a form of high tech
procrastination. If I think back on it,

548
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,460
I think a lot of it was just pie tech
procrastination. We do as human beings,

549
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,700
astonishing things to ensure
our own failure or to at
least ensure that we don't

550
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,310
realize our potential tension.

551
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,810
And we do crazy things like have
a family with three kids that we,

552
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:19,330
and with a woman we don't like or,
or,

553
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,360
or take a job that we have to take because
we got a hold down this massive nut

554
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:27,250
we create for ourselves when
what we should be doing.

555
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,480
And actually it's turning pro. He talks
about this a lot. Pressfield, Pressfield,

556
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,010
you know, and the war of art and the war
of art. It was so we do these things,

557
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:38,650
it's very hard and I always tell people,
I say,

558
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:42,530
if you really want to try
an exercise, just, just it.

559
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,950
Ask yourself if you couldn't fail,
if you couldn't fail,

560
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,030
you can get anything you want.

561
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,500
Just make a list of what you
really want in technicolor and,

562
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,480
and see what it does to you. It's
hard to face up to it. You know,

563
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:55,780
a lot of people have like competing like
notions in their own mind about money.

564
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,410
You know,
they,

565
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,170
there was psychiatry talking about how
you have all these weird things like

566
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:03,030
money, money buys. You can't
buy you happiness. It's the
root of all evil, right?

567
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,250
But we all want money.
So we within our own mind,

568
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:09,250
we had these major conflicts of interest.

569
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,870
Whenever you bring up the word money
because it ha it conjures up both negative

570
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,550
and positive images in us.

571
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,750
That's interesting to me because you and
I know that if you make enough money,

572
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,420
you can do a lot of good with it.
You can make a difference with it.

573
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,960
So everybody should be trying in some
way to be, it's not just about money,

574
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:28,330
but trying to be the best they can be.
Cause you'll make a difference.

575
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:30,400
But I think within ourselves,

576
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:33,720
part of the human problem and
something you have to face it,

577
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:38,380
but as you get older is the fact that
there are a lot of contradictions within

578
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:42,030
your own mind because they'd been
given to you. You know? Um, it's,

579
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,660
it's really hard sometimes to just have
because you have to actually think you

580
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:47,494
deserve it.

581
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,500
And most of us are conditioned to be
guilty about having too much, you know?

582
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,790
Yeah. Well there's a lot of people in this
country that feel like it's okay to be

583
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,860
angry you because you're successful.

584
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,910
There's a lot of people that will sell
it go fucking rouge as lots less in this

585
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:05,650
country than other countries.
And I'll tell you why.

586
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,830
And one of the strengths of our country
is this. And George will has a great,

587
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,580
he gave a great speech
about this. Um, the, the,

588
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:16,240
the great thing about America
is that all of us out there, no,

589
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,360
and I hope we're not losing side of
this because in some ways you can get

590
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,220
cynical about the way
this world is wired now.

591
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:24,640
But at the bottom line is a lot of
Americans know, I may be poor today,

592
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,490
but if I do the right thing,
I might be rich tomorrow.

593
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,900
And that sense of potential in the
American character is what drives this

594
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:36,340
economy. It's why we're so innovative.
That's all well and good as an ideal.

595
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:40,070
But the real problem has nothing to
do with America. An ideal. The real

596
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,090
problem has to do with weakness of
character and people not liking people who

597
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:47,540
were successful. Yes. You know, I had
a friend who will remain nameless,

598
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,360
but he's a very nice guy and he's
a comedian. He's a sort of a,

599
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:54,020
a bit of the self hating nebbishy
type. And he said, good, it's you.

600
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,200
You're always doing this with your
body. Like why? You know why, why?

601
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,860
Why have your why have all these
muscles? Why, why being shaped like,

602
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,680
why are you so concentrated
on that? Like for real, I go,

603
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,890
if I gave you a pill and that pill,
all you could do,

604
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:10,880
you could take this pill and you all of
a sudden you're, you're a super athlete.

605
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,800
You're a person who's unlike 99.9%
of the people who run the street.

606
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,830
You're a martial arts expert.
You could choke people.

607
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:23,750
You could kick the shit out of them if
you wanted to. You can defend yourself.

608
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,080
Wouldn't you take that pill? And
he goes, yeah, I would. I go, well,

609
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:31,100
that pill is just hard work, right? If you
do hard work, you'd become that. And See,

610
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:33,800
I did it without a pill.
Consistency. So it's the same thing.

611
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:37,100
It's like there's nothing
wrong with being in shape.

612
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,320
The only thing that's
wrong with being a chain,

613
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:42,710
because if you're not in shape and you
see a guys in shape and you see a woman

614
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,770
react to that guy and shape in
a very sexually attracted way,

615
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:49,340
it makes you feel uncomfortable.
So you want to pull the goal back.

616
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,410
You want to make the game easier.
You want,

617
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,870
you don't want to compete
with this guy. You know, and,

618
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,910
and it starts with like I always
tell people, you know, but first,

619
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,790
first ask yourself,
be honest with yourself man.

620
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,460
Sit there alone and ask
yourself what you really want.

621
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,340
I mean ask you some detail then don't go.

622
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,550
Don't like if you have to get your
phd or something ridiculous. Don't,

623
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,510
don't look at the top of the mountain.
Just take an action every day.

624
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,840
I don't care what it is,
one little action and,

625
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,510
and that's what I do like just take,
just keep taking. It's like working out.

626
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,840
Show up. I don't give a shit
if you start with five minutes,

627
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,720
when you show up to you develop momentum,
that's it.

628
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,160
When you start to develop a momentum,
the human being relies a lot on momentum.

629
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:34,430
It's a weird habit.
We're obese of habit and momentum.

630
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,820
And when you that have a habit
of working out all the time,

631
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,380
if I don't work out for a few days, I feel
super uncomfortable. I don't feel good.

632
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,860
You have to, you have to exercise
on a regular, regular basis.

633
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:48,800
And when you do that, you develop
momentum. When I write a lot, I'm writing,

634
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:51,920
I get on a momentous sort of a wave and I,

635
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,290
I feel good about it and it becomes
a part of my habit. That's Ya.

636
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,360
You'll have to do is make, give yourself
positive habits, positive habits.

637
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,920
These accesses the habit, by the way.
You're right. Yeah. Be Proud. Be Proud of,

638
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:07,260
of getting work done. Be happy that
you're getting work done. I mean that,

639
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:08,330
that is what you do.

640
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,610
You know a lot of people also remember
you surround yourself with a lot of

641
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,100
people who don't want happy for you.
Then I actually your friends,

642
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:14,300
but what they are is their comfort.

643
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:16,430
They're creatures of comfort
and not actually your friends.

644
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,360
And I think it's important. Sometimes you
got to change your fucking gang change.

645
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:25,370
We're one of the reasons why you and I
were such good friends when I met you.

646
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,450
It's like you, first of all, you were the,

647
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:31,820
for the closest guy to me I've
ever met in my life. I was like,

648
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:32,690
Holy Shit.

649
00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:37,691
Here's this guy who's like exactly
like me and you required nothing.

650
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,870
You like you, you had no like what? Man,

651
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,760
you're not going to come to my
birthday party and you weren't.

652
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:44,820
There was not no creepy
dummy shit in there.

653
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,170
And I had just gotten out of a friendship
where I had to kick a guy out of my

654
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:51,720
life because I was friends
with them when I was broke.

655
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,750
And then once I got on television he
got really fucking jealous and he said a

656
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,900
lot of dumb shit. I asked him
not to give away my phone number.

657
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,960
I said I have two phone numbers because
I've always had like a media phone and

658
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:08,490
in the regular phone because when you do
media like you, like you do radio shows,

659
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:09,510
they have to call you back.

660
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,780
And I want to have a phone where if I
pull it out of the wall I don't give a

661
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,900
fuck who calls, you know, so I have that
phone. So I said, just do me a favor.

662
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,260
Your friend who by the way just
cut out of a mental institution,

663
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,930
would you do me a favor?
And just give him my other phone.

664
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,840
He doesn't fucking care about you,
man. Just cause you, you're on TV.

665
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,580
Your friend just got out of a mental
institution. He's fucking crazy.

666
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:32,670
All I'm asking is if you're going to
bring this crazy guy into my life by

667
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:36,570
connection given the media
phone and he went in the school,

668
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,910
you think you're such a fucking bad
ass cause you're on TV. I'm like,

669
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:41,070
what is this?
What are you even talking about man?

670
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,820
I'm asking you not to give your crazy
friend like number. That's it. Yeah,

671
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,450
that's it. And all of a sudden it has
to become some attack on, you know,

672
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,710
and I'm on my success. And it was
a, it wasn't even a big success,

673
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,550
it was just part on a sitcom. But you
remind them of what they're not doing.

674
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,980
And a lot of people go into
this notion of scarcity,

675
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:01,800
this idea that there's only
a certain amount of the pie.

676
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,960
And if my somebody else is doing well,
I'm not going to do with,

677
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm not even thinking that all they're
thinking about is themselves and not

678
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:10,470
looking at us as giant
picture of resources.

679
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,330
All they're doing is just like being a
baby. All of a sudden is what about me?

680
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,840
I had a friend who got apart and as he
got a part, you've got a part in a sitcom.

681
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,400
His girlfriend started crying.
I'm never gonna get anything.

682
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,440
What about me? Like this guy just got
a part on a sitcom. He was so happy.

683
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:33,210
He was like, I can't believe I got
it. I nailed the audition. I got it.

684
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,870
I worked my ass.
Man.

685
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,373
Woo.

686
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,950
Don't date actresses, actresses.
It's part of the song.

687
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,950
Very strict. No head shots, policies. It's
very always steal that. Cause I, I uh,

688
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,940
I went through my head shots
phase and I, uh, I just stopped
doing it. Yeah. You, uh,

689
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,130
you learn, you know, you
don't want to date anybody.

690
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,710
It's just fucked up as you are. That's
very bottom line. I don't want to do it.

691
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,600
I can manage my fucked up in this. I don't
want to introduce yours and the other,

692
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,050
the downstage. I was talking
about my daughter and I was like,

693
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,120
I just don't want her
to date a guy like me.

694
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,640
That sounds so I got to play a
character for the next 15 years.

695
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,270
So she imprints on and that's
somebody different. Yeah.

696
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,080
Well my friends had a of good do if the
start date and girls or started dating

697
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,920
boys. I'm like, guess what? Girls like
boys. That's it. Boys like girls too.

698
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,670
The only thing you can do is this.
Here's my philosophy. It's good. It's,

699
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,670
they're supposed to like girls and girls
are supposed to like boys tell them

700
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:34,240
with the right values and a good mind,
they're gonna make their mistakes. That's,

701
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:38,050
that's all you can it afraid of
their child. Make sure if they're,

702
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,540
if they're looking up to a yogurt
like Kim Kardashian and just give an

703
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:43,770
alternative, they're not going to
look up to that dummy. It's real.

704
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,370
If you don't fuck your kids up,

705
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,820
if you raised them like they're friends
and you talk to them and communicate

706
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:49,061
with them,

707
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:53,190
they're not going to be attracted to
something as stupid as a life of Kim Dash

708
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,480
watching you. I'm watching you with
your first daughter and you were,

709
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,040
you would talk to her like an adult and
when I would talk to him and like this,

710
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,060
cause I didn't,
I didn't know anything about play.

711
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:10,530
I play with my kids but I talked to them
and I think kids know a lot more than

712
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:14,620
you think. They know. You know, I mean
I, I'm, I'm down to play princess.

713
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,950
I'm down to pretend Santa Claus is real.
I'm down for pretend.

714
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,450
But when it comes to emotions,

715
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,780
one of the first things I do whenever
I catch them doing something wrong,

716
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,700
like they hit each other
or yell at each other,

717
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,720
I always tell them that I did the same
thing always like one of them bit her

718
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:32,860
sister the other day I go a bit, a little
girl when I was five I got in trouble.

719
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:36,100
But some girl in her hand, she was
sticking her hand on my mouse. I'm like,

720
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:40,670
fuck you bitch. I better. Yeah.
So I told her after first,

721
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,200
after the first three times you put
your hand in your mouth on my mouth and

722
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:48,100
watching her little four year old eyes
like look at me and realized that I used

723
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:49,750
to be dumb and did a lot of like,

724
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:52,480
it wasn't just her daddy
and wasn't just an adult.

725
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,900
At one point in time I was a little
child as well, just like her.

726
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:56,800
And I was telling her like,

727
00:39:56,801 --> 00:40:00,220
I very remember biting this
girl and it was very traumatic.

728
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:01,090
I shouldn't have done it.

729
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:05,260
And the girl was mad at her mom was
mad and I felt like an idiot, you know?

730
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:08,020
And her mom's like, why didn't you just
slugger? You didn't have to bite her.

731
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,610
And I'm like, I'm sorry.
It was just felt like fuck.

732
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,810
I mean it didn't even break skin
or anything. It was just so dark.

733
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:18,180
The worst thing from me, the worst times
in my life, I can realize, remember,

734
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,200
was when I was embarrassed. Do
you tell your kids this? Really,

735
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,450
I haven't told my daughter that it
was old enough now to understand

736
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,200
anytime there's any sort of an issue.

737
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,880
I think that's one of the
most important things.

738
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,110
The same with my stepdaughter was an old,
older boy.

739
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:37,550
He's done the same thing with her. Um,
she's not, I mean say stepdaughter,

740
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:42,580
she's my daughter. And um, and when,
well that's why I communicate what,

741
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,820
but what I communicate,
whether it's the same thing,

742
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:49,150
it's always gotta be
that the human beings,

743
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
you're giving them the benefit of the
doubt actually they have the same mind is

744
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,000
we do, they don't have context.
That's exactly what children,

745
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,200
and when you bring them into your world
like that and you communicate with them

746
00:40:58,201 --> 00:41:00,430
their, then they'll bring you
into their thoughts as well.

747
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:04,120
It's amazing how much my four year old
just opens up and talks to me about how

748
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:08,140
she feels about things. What bothers
her. And do you think that you have a,

749
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,310
I was just talking about this with the,

750
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,230
I just recorded something with Jay Moore
on my podcast and I asked him if he had

751
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:17,680
a primary cra question that
runs through his mind every day.

752
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,500
Do you think you wake up with a
primary question? No. You don't have,

753
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,130
you don't have one overriding question.
No. Join Myself. That's, I don't know.

754
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,780
I think this is a journey. I just think
this is a ride. Absolutely. Look, it is,

755
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,680
it's temporary. It's not going to last. I
just want to enjoy myself. I want to be,

756
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,070
uh, uh, amongst friends and have a good
time. Have a good time doing my standup,

757
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:39,800
doing my work.
I have a good time doing Jujitsu,

758
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,210
hanging out with my boys at 10th planet
and John John Machado's having a good

759
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:48,980
time driving around, listening to music,
being nice to people. Yeah. I feel like,

760
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:49,491
you know,

761
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:53,990
we're all a little too small and this
giant universe to take ourselves too

762
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:58,460
serious. There's no benefit in it.
There's no benefit and self, grand jury.

763
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,930
There's the, the benefit is in friendship.
The benefit is in fun. Laughter. Can I,

764
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:06,020
I'm so psyched about you coming over here.
Like we talked about this,

765
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,340
our families are together.
Uh, Brian's wife's here. Um,
we have, uh, the kids here.

766
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,500
I've got steaks.
We're going to play some music,

767
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:15,910
listen to some music and drink some wine.
That's what life's about.

768
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:18,080
That's what life is about. Having
fun. I say that to you. I said,

769
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,830
we are going to mark our lives by the
number of times we laughed at each other

770
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,090
and we're silly and, and we're, we're,

771
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:27,810
we're just surprising and shocking each
other stats, but it's about Stan Ho.

772
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:31,760
Ba and I were on the phone the other day
and he was drunk and, uh, and he's like,

773
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:36,090
you know, I could quit standup but I
couldn't quit standups. He goes, I can't.

774
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,240
He goes, I don't need to do
comedy anymore. He goes by that.

775
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,850
I never want to stop hanging
out with comics cause you know,

776
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,020
he and I were just on the phone.

777
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,890
We're just laughing and talking
shit and laughing and laughing.

778
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,840
He called me. He was listening to the
Jamie podcast, Jamie Kilstein podcast.

779
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:54,490
In a, in a, in a van filled with
other people, like it was on,

780
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,010
on tour and he called me, it
sounded like a comedy club. He goes,

781
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,270
I just want to tell you,

782
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,630
we're listening to you right now
and everybody has something to say.

783
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,391
And then new,

784
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:05,240
like he holds up the phone and all the
comics and the vantage screaming and

785
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:06,290
cheering and applauding.

786
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,880
Jamie Kilstein had said some crazy shit
about tosh shouldn't have said that.

787
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:14,120
Rape Joke. And it was like he
went captain feminist on people,

788
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,940
so standup call and then I called them
back and we're just laughing and he's,

789
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,480
he feels like he's self so fun.

790
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,390
That's the kind of human beings
you're supposed to be in contact with.

791
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,430
Joey D is every time I'm hanging out with
their original, what a stamp on life.

792
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:32,040

just, he looks over at UFC and I'm,

793
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:35,870
I'm sitting like literally like six,
10 chairs away and he goes,

794
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,520
he just leaves him in. There's no
drama, no drama. And everybody's like,

795
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:43,530
what the fuck is that guy saying?
I was like, no drama, no drama.

796
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,870
We would do it at the end of the
world show with Joey Diaz, Doug, Stan,

797
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:51,950

and a band called honey honey.

798
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,490

at the Wiltern theater.

808
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,070
I would've come after that. I met
Stan Health and I'm a big, yeah,

809
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,250
I'd love to meet him. He's a great
guy. He's the best. I don't important.

810
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,230
He's so important to me.
He's like,

811
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,500
he's a real guy really doing it.

812
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,410
He's refreshing and he's 100% legit.

813
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,990
He's a 100% legit,

814
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:48,060
hilarious headliner comedian who's
just really into continuing to do that.

815
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,290
I'll be occasionally, reluctantly,
he's, he's, he's a little real deal man.

816
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:57,060
I was talking about Jay more today and uh,
and he, I said, yeah. I said, what's your,

817
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,400
what's your definition of heaven? And
I said, to be honest with you, man,

818
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,850
I think it's just being on
stage and doing stand up.

819
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,980
I don't think I'll ever take time off away
from me. He's like, what are you going,

820
00:45:05,981 --> 00:45:08,700
when are you gonna Retire? I don't
think, I think I want to be don Rickles.

821
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,380
I'll be 85 years old.

822
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,100
The one fucking standup because we're not
just so much fun and what else could I

823
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:16,400
be doing finally?
Something else that's really fun.

824
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,640
You want to go skydiving when it, Nah,
I got, if people still want to listen,

825
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:23,060
I'll still be doing it. And when
they don't want to listen anymore,

826
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,270
when you're doing like half filled
shows and the people are barely,

827
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:28,470
then you're like, well maybe it
sounded packet in. But then again,

828
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:31,080
maybe it's time to go back to the drawing
board and come out with new stuff.

829
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,490
Well, it could be. Yeah, for sure. I mean,
it could be that it could be a lapse,

830
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:38,970
but for some people it's
the end. You know, there's a
lot of people that get fat,

831
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,090
get fat in the brain. They
have to, got to keep feeding.

832
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:45,090
I always tell like young comics,
I'm like, feed your brain.

833
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,420
It's important to read everything if
you can or as much as you can you you,

834
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,490
and keep asking yourself the next
question. It's how you stay dynamic.

835
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:56,550
It's how your material will grow and
it's how you will grow as a person.

836
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:57,960
You know,
one of the things I've been getting,

837
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:00,330
nothing but great feedback about
this podcast I did with my dad. Well,

838
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:04,800
my dad's 72 what my dad continues to do
and what I respect about him so much as

839
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:06,000
he continues to grow.

840
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:11,100
I watched the 72 year old guy taking
Italian and going to Italy for three weeks

841
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,760
and throwing himself into a town.
When the fuck is he going to use it?

842
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,610
Talions yet he doesn't care.

843
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:20,550
He takes it reading these obscure
things on quantum physics and stuff.

844
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,140
He's just always so because he enjoys it.
I think what people have to really,

845
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:28,320
the reason why that's shocking to people
is most people feel like there's a

846
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:29,550
destination.
Well,

847
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:32,520
I'm going to reach retirement and when
I reach retirement then I'm going to

848
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:33,690
change.
There is no,

849
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:38,940
there is just now there is just life
and you should think about the future,

850
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:43,941
but your primary concern should be now
it should be a life and what do you enjoy

851
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:48,840
doing? Do you enjoy learning things? Do
enjoy reading? Do you enjoy isolation?

852
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:52,770
Tanks are fucking hikes or workout
that stuff. And by the way,

853
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,090
here's something for people to say,

854
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:56,610
well I can't do that cause I got to put
money on food on the table for my kids.

855
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,810
You'll set a very,
very good example to your children.

856
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,890
If you're following your dream and
what you're supposed to be doing that

857
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:05,820
children pick up on,

858
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:08,640
that they can pick up on whether you're
you're doing drudgery or you're doing

859
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:11,550
something inspiring for yourself and
it'll make your household better.

860
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:13,470
In my opinion. That's easy
for me to say, by the way,

861
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:15,600
cause I'm not having to pay bills
all the time so I don't want to,

862
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,060
I don't want to be too disrespectful
that people who were actually trying to

863
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:20,700
just make some money and
figure their shit out,

864
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:22,980
but just keeping in the back
of your mind that you know,

865
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:26,910
just just find some people get an easy
ride in this life. We all know that.

866
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:30,380
Some people get really lucky and
they get an easy ride in this life,

867
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:35,620
but that doesn't usually last.
Most of the people would get an easy ride.

868
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:39,010
If they don't earn it, they wind
up fucking it up. That's true.

869
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,040
Almost always true and your ride is
different than anybody else's ride as my

870
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,140
ride is different from
anybody else's ride,

871
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:50,680
but you gotta except that instead of
being mad at other people's rides,

872
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,650
you got to only look at what you're dealt.

873
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,950
What is the hand your
dealt moved from there?

874
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,360
Don't worry about this guy who's fucking
rich prick. He's born in new floor.

875
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:04,120
Could Richo said it's nothing to judge
[inaudible] he's got all this money.

876
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:07,180
Could think she's or that
is not your concern. Okay,

877
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:11,050
that guy's got his own problems.
If you concentrate on him and hate on him,

878
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:12,610
that is wasted resources.

879
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,680
When you should be concentrating on is
what hand where you dealt, you know, well,

880
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:19,690
I'm not so good at math, but you know
why and I think I want to be a rapper.

881
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:24,130
Be a rapper. What? Concentrate on
yourself. Concentrate on one hand,

882
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,400
please remember also, this is so
important as I get older, this is,

883
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:28,450
there's no doubt about this.

884
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,870
Anybody who you admire who's really good
at something, whether it's to drums,

885
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:34,840
Jujitsu, math, whatever, please know this.

886
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,700
They've put in at least 10 years of really
hard work at, not always. Not always.

887
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:43,060
You know what I'm saying? Some people
are prodigies, but quick, but anything,

888
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:45,520
anything that you,
anything that you want to get good at,

889
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,270
you're going to have to put daily practice
into and should always do it for the

890
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:54,030
sake of the practice, not the result you
get. You get just as much like somebody,

891
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,860
somebody said, well I don't know about
the time I get my psychology degree.

892
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,260
I don't know if I get,
look, you're going to be,

893
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,230
while you're trying to get
your psychology degree,

894
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,850
you're going to be meeting people.

895
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:06,400
You want to be around who are dynamic
and interesting cause they're gonna be

896
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:10,180
doing the same thing you're doing.
So it's the fun starts almost right away.

897
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,591
Well it's,

898
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:16,390
people just get scared about longterm
goals and longterm commitments.

899
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:20,140
It's like, just keep working. You're
going to keep working anyway on something.

900
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:21,820
Right.
Are you just going to stop moving?

901
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,730
You're going to work on feeding yourself.
You're going to fucking move forward.

902
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:26,980
Tim Ferriss said something interesting
in his book. He goes, my goals,

903
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:30,130
I don't set these 10 year goals. I set
three month goals, six month goals,

904
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,310
nine month goals, 12 months goals
that that's a good way to do it.

905
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:36,010
You can get a lot done in three months.
So you know, just something simple.

906
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,640
I don't set any goals, you
know, never, never set goals.

907
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,110
I set objectives like as far as like what
I want to get done in days during the

908
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:48,460
day, but I, my goal is to be doing what I
wanted to do and I'm already doing that.

909
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,810
Oh yeah.
You've always thought I don't have any,

910
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,410
but you've always had very clear
notions. I'm talking to you, you'll go,

911
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,230
I remember you going on to start
my own TV show, my own TV channel.

912
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,730
I remember you saying that before
the podcast. Then you were like, Duh,

913
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:59,890
I'm going to do a podcast.

914
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,880
So you get these ideas and the difference
between you is that once you get an

915
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:06,970
idea like that,
like once you're into something,

916
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,820
whether it's a video game or a sport,
you're a,

917
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,450
you're a co Ku Cooper about it.

918
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,570
Fucking cuckoo. Like, I'm like,
what are you doing? He goes,

919
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,310
I just finished practicing quake for
15 hours. I fainted. I'm like, well,

920
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,260
how about I'll do it for an
hour and 15 minutes, 59 hours.

921
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,190
I fainted.
I didn't get any water.

922
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:29,751
That's you.
Well,

923
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:34,751
I grew up completely obsessed with
martial arts and that mindset of,

924
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:39,590
uh, the, the practice of martial
arts, which was defining for me,

925
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:41,240
let's look made me a human being.

926
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:44,340
It was the first thing I was ever
really good at. That became the,

927
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:48,530
the way I live my whole life and
live life like you're about to,

928
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:52,250
you're about to do the most dangerous
thing you could ever possibly imagine.

929
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:55,470
So you have to be obsessed with it to get
really good at it. I can't, not again,

930
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,230
like half ass something.
I get crazy.

931
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,930
But why do you think you would be good
at standup? Will you a class towns?

932
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,080
I didn't think I was kidding.
I didn't either.

933
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,100
I had a very specific idea that the
only people that laughed at me with the

934
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:10,670
people that were these sick fucks that
I trained with because those are the

935
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:13,730
people that taught my friend Ed
shorter and my friend Steve Graham,

936
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,800
Steve Graham is still one of
my best friends to this day.

937
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,680
When I was a little kid,

938
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,960
I used to make everybody laugh
at the top of my middle school.

939
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,460
I would do these impressions of my
instructor having sex with one of the

940
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:30,200
students. I never did any of that. I would
do it like, you know, in their, you know,

941
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:34,760
in the voice and with their accent shit
and it would be like one of our friends

942
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,840
was your intro. You're currently what? The
bluebells Korean. Your instructor? Yeah.

943
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:39,683
Well it wasn't,

944
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,490
that guy was another guy that actually
make fun of who is like more of an

945
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,280
assistant. My instructor was Korean
and he, we really respected him.

946
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:48,050
He's an amazing,
still an amazing guy,

947
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:49,340
one of the most influential
people in my life.

948
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:51,770
But I used to call fellow students as him

949
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:58,700
as a, as a chore. You know, my friends
would freak it. They'd be like,

950
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,970
Hi sir, how are you? Like why is he
calling me? He never called anybody.

951
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:05,240
We definitely have that in common that
we used to do impressions of people that

952
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:08,300
we knew. Yeah. That's what's
like the first kind of humor.

953
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:12,080
You recognize something goofy that
someone does and so you repeat it and I'm

954
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,730
putting my ridiculous scenarios,

955
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,620
but my first comedy came from high
school when I was in high school.

956
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:22,430
I was not a funny kid. I was a much
more troubled kid then I was funny,

957
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,690
but when, no, but I was an artist
and when no one was around,

958
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:28,520
I would go into Mr Homans class.

959
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:31,310
Mr. Holman was this really
wacky science teacher.

960
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:35,240
He's really fucking crazy and I knew how
to draw them all and I had a character

961
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,840
choice. Forget that. You're really good
drawer. I always forget that. Oh yeah.

962
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:42,380
I wanted to be a cartoon art.
I mean I'm a comic book artist.

963
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:47,460
I dedicated a lot of time and it was one
high school teacher that's sucked that

964
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,000
completely turned me off to it. I was
like, I can't do thank God for him. Yeah.

965
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,550
I think thank God for
that. Could be not, I mean,

966
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:55,610
I wouldn't have enjoyed being an artist.
A maybe I wouldn't have had to, you know,

967
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:59,990
be so, uh, I can't see you in a sitting
in a, at a drafting table all day.

968
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,190
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. I don't
know. I don't know. I enjoyed
it though. I really enjoyed,

969
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:09,170
uh, illustrations. Um, uh, what
was my point? The, by the way,

970
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:12,170
illustrations are hypnotic, aren't
they? I mean, you can paint all day.

971
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:14,930
Like I know painters who set this guy,
I can't remember.

972
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:19,100
Damson ain't going to make me go off
traffic, Mr. Holman. Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

973
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:21,680
I just have to remember this.
So what I would do,

974
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:26,070
my first stab of humor was I would
draw pictures of this dude on

975
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,820
the board, like pictures of him,
but fuck. And other students or,

976
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,360
and then there's a guy named Mr. White
who's this really short dude who just got

977
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:36,780
back from Vietnam and he was
fucking crazy. And Mr. White,

978
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:40,480
I always drew him standing on
a chair or standing on a stool,

979
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,480
always drew him standing
on top of something.

980
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,610
And it was always screaming about nom, you
know, and uh, people would fucking how,

981
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:48,900
and I would put it on the chalkboard.

982
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,660
I got suspended because I
drew the Spanish teachers,

983
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:55,890
Penta teacher wore like a ton of, make
unbelievable amounts of makeup, like,

984
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:56,724
like a clown.

985
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,930
And then I drew her like her face with
all the makeup and then I drew a werewolf.

986
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,530
This is her without makeup and
fucking food was really good,

987
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:07,110
like fangs and slobbers I knew you were
really funny before I'd even seen you to

988
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:10,560
stand up. We were at the EOC and, and you
were sitting there and we were on a bus.

989
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,120
We were going, we were going back
being shuttled back something.

990
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:16,590
And this is like back in the day when
Randy couture, like had his first fight.

991
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,580
And I remember somebody goes, well,
Joe, what are you going to do tonight?

992
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:23,130
And he goes, and you were like, ah, I
think I'm going to get in a horse stance,

993
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:26,070
pushed my balls into my body and read
Nietzsche with a Bandanna around my head.

994
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,500
I was like,

995
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:35,490
yes, that's my favorite.
Kind of tends to wash downs.

996
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,320
There's a lot of dudes who
thought they could do that.

997
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:40,040
They don't think it pulled her balls
into their body too. And I used to try.

998
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,720
What are you talking about?
Just nobody was more obsessed.

999
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:44,010
The only person more
obsessed with martial arts.

1000
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,830
Then you want me to put
your balls anywhere?

1001
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:50,280
I can't do any movement with my balls.
You have to push him in.

1002
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,750
Have you ever tried Tantra? You ever
tried like squeezing your, you're,

1003
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,270
you're strengthening your core
muscles so you don't let any come out.

1004
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:01,440
Does that work? Could you
make it stronger? They look,
it's what every guy does.

1005
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:04,620
Who doesn't come right away. Okay. That's
what the fuck it's called maturity.

1006
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:07,800
It's learning how to, I remember
being younger and just fucking say I,

1007
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:11,370
the minute I smelled a girl, I'd
come. I'd be like, oh fucking God,

1008
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,660
don't move out until late.

1009
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,360
Isn't there some sort of a physiological
benefit to not orgasming and letting

1010
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:21,040
your body like assimilate
the commonwell the essay,

1011
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,330
the idea is that fighters,

1012
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:28,650
the Samurai and the idea is that you can
boost your testosterone and apparently

1013
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:32,910
the semen goes up your spine. Not True
at all. Not True at all. But believe me,

1014
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:36,690
I believed it and used to say it for
years. I remember one time going, no,

1015
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:37,390
we used to not,

1016
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:41,840
we'd go with like two weeks without
jerking off or her getting late and would

1017
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,790
just make you really feel a really
aggressive, I wouldn't do that.

1018
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:49,170
I try to cook two district
science on fight science.
John Brenkus that that show,

1019
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:53,970
they had guys not have sex for like a
week or something and they measured their

1020
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:58,260
testosterone and then they had him like
calm and stuff and and there was no

1021
00:55:58,261 --> 00:55:59,520
difference.
They actually,

1022
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:02,810
they actually have tested different
scientific fight sciences.

1023
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:03,610
Not the fuck they're talking.

1024
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,880
They don't have shown there's
a physiological difference,

1025
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:09,150
but it only lasts for seven days.
After seven days it normalizes,

1026
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,120
but for seven days you get a
higher level of testosterone.

1027
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:14,340
It's like your body is like,
come on last chance to not be a pussy.

1028
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:16,110
Let's go get some, c'mon,
c'mon, let's go get some.

1029
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:21,180
I would think that your buddies crews
more testosterone to develop, build sperm,

1030
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:24,490
but then again I'm not a fucking doctor.
I think it's also

1031
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,360
to increase your competitive drive
in order to get some more pussy.

1032
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,450
It's like your body recognizes
like that you haven't scored,

1033
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,240
you haven't tried to reproduce so because
you haven't tried to reproduce it buys

1034
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,960
like listen, let's fucking amp
this gorilla up, get them fired up,

1035
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,120
ready to fight in case another
male comes along. Yeah, yeah.

1036
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,460
Cause Cause Pussy scarce like
in Alaska or Boston. We're,

1037
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:49,300
hopefully you and I will be. Yeah, we're
going to go, you're going to stop coming.

1038
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:52,470
I'm coming. I'm coming hunting with
you and I and let's, let's, let's,

1039
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,100
let's move this conversation over to,
to a little show called pig man.

1040
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:01,530
Holy Shit. Talk about
that weaponry. By the way,

1041
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:05,800
40 of them I've talked to Rinella
about an IA. Fucking hates that show.

1042
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:10,390
Steven Ella, who's the guy who's the
host of meat eater, he helicopters, dude.

1043
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:12,360
But he's a fair chase hunter.
I mean he's,

1044
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:16,180
what he does is everything he does
is like stalking. He stalks his prey.

1045
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:19,510
He doesn't wait and tree stand with a
pile of food lane this and then blow them.

1046
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,960
Yeah. Oh, that's what we're
going, oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Oh,

1047
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:27,190
he's an animal. You got to go. He's, he's
a great guy to a very intelligent guy.

1048
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:31,930
He's not like you ship a girl, you know,
just look hood and you know, he's a,

1049
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,530
he's a guy who, it's very sacred
to him. The whole, the whole,

1050
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:39,490
like he went to a ranch once, they put
him in a tree stand and then he said,

1051
00:57:39,491 --> 00:57:41,800
well at 6:00 AM the deer come around.
Cause that's when we,

1052
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,980
that's when the feeders opened up and
he realized there was electronic feeders

1053
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,960
and it's like, I can't do
this. He wouldn't do it.

1054
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,990
Whereas like Ted Nugent just fucking
launches arrows to those pitchy. I mean,

1055
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,430
he literally target practice.
It's basically pigs.

1056
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,310
It's actually domesticated
pigs that became feral. Well,

1057
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:58,980
the pig man shows different.
I mean,

1058
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,220
they're actually reading
the diary of a pastor. Yeah.

1059
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,180
They have a real problem to like poor
people. Yes, yes, yes. They give the meat,

1060
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:10,570
the needy families and it's good.
Neat. It's good. Well, it's wild pork.

1061
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:15,190
It's delicious. But the, uh, the pigs
are a huge problem. They destroy crops.

1062
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:19,960
They, uh, they run, they spread disease
and when they plant the seeds, they go in,

1063
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:22,780
they route and they pull the seeds
out of the ground and eat the seeds.

1064
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:25,840
Pigs will eat anything
and they're fucking huge.

1065
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,650
So they have to radically cut them. So in
Texas it's legal to hunt them from God.

1066
00:58:30,651 --> 00:58:34,160
Does cons are, I don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,

1067
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,940
they just taken these fucking pigs
out while the pigs are running.

1068
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,000
They're blowing their brains
out and the pigs do flips.

1069
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:48,150
They killed 200 pigs plus
and 10 coyotes on one show.

1070
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,380
I don't like,
I like coyotes.

1071
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:54,100
Why would you like ladies good cause
you imagine if your baby was outside by

1072
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:55,790
itself and the coyote came along.
How do you think,

1073
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,610
how do you think that would work?
I don't even know.

1074
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,900
Eat your baby every coyote near your baby.
Fuck himself.

1075
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:08,800
Every Kyler that ever lived, I will
put a bullet in his fucking brand on,

1076
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:12,010
I have great pack structures there.
Cons could fuck good hunters.

1077
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:14,560
They beat and cock suckers.
Each and every one of them.

1078
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:21,710
He make up anything to fucking kill,
to kill something like they babies.

1079
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:25,500
I have proved leave a baby
alone. Coyote, coyote shovel.

1080
00:59:25,501 --> 00:59:27,950
We kill guy was called
baby killing baby killers.

1081
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,580
That would be a satisfying show if you
just left a baby in a pen in the middle

1082
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:34,760
of a street and the coyote is just come
around and you pick them off a sniper

1083
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:38,930
rifles like, hey, deserves
it. This motherfuck was going
to eat the baby. The baby.

1084
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,850
He was coming from the baby.

1085
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,620
That's good.
I'm not in the coyotes.

1086
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,530
I when your dog gets eaten
by a mountain lion, it's,

1087
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,080
you have a different perspective
to me and hit you. Oh,

1088
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,340
well I haven't had those
before. Yeah, pimples are great.

1089
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,130
How about when you come home and one
of them killed the other one? Yeah,

1090
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,840
that was a lot of fun.
Living Room was a puddle of blood.

1091
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,160
The dog I told you to adopt,
she was actually the coffee table.

1092
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,440
She was with Taylor,
a coffee table with tea.

1093
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:10,060
She was a crocodile with a wood foot, long
legs. She was actually a crocodile. She,

1094
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:13,730
she had a crocodile head and
she was clearly half crocodile,

1095
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,970
sweetest dog about. I called.
He's like, Oh hey, this is one.

1096
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:21,620
We were completely retarded. I
was like, Hey, get down here now.

1097
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,230
I knew cause I couldn't adopt
him cause I had, I had a female,

1098
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:27,530
she was so sweet and you're like,
I'm taking her there. Talk loved me.

1099
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,251
There was a problem.

1100
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:31,010
She loved me and she didn't want the
other dogs around because they would get

1101
01:00:31,011 --> 01:00:33,140
some of my loans. It's devastating
to, and I want you to fight.

1102
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,400
She would fight to the death.

1103
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:37,580
She was ready to fight to the death
over you petting. Did she ever do frank?

1104
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:43,880
Only pimples to find other man like male
females. They fronted. Yeah, it's bad.

1105
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,980
It was bad. I had to, I
had to put them both down.

1106
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,530
Put Frank down to you get
tired of that shit. Right.

1107
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,250
They both tried to kill each other.
It was horrible. I couldn't trust him.

1108
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,820
Frank was like devastated after it was
over. She won. She beat the mail. She did.

1109
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,130
Yup. Yeah, I left him for
dead. He was all fucked up.

1110
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:01,580
He was in the hospital for
weeks. Yeah. Yeah. I never,

1111
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,700
never thought that they would fight
and never thought the mail and a few,

1112
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:04,700
I would separate the females,

1113
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:07,100
but I never thought the mayor would
fight with a female and they fought.

1114
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:09,740
You know what, they fought over the
pool guy. The Pool Guy came over to,

1115
01:01:09,741 --> 01:01:10,550
to clean the pool.

1116
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,370
They started heading there pending
the poor guy pet one of them.

1117
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:18,290
And she would fight frank if, if
uh, if she wasn't getting pet. Yeah.

1118
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:22,740
Well she got fucked up man. When she was
in that pen or in the pound for awhile,

1119
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,040
she was fucked up cause it was one of
those shelters where they didn't kill the

1120
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:28,400
animal, they'd kept the animal around
and she was a fighting dog before that.

1121
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:31,700
So she was a fighting dog and then all
of a sudden she's in the pound and then

1122
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:34,490
all of a sudden she's at this house and
this guy is super sweet to her and loves

1123
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:36,380
her and pet her and feed her food.
And she said,

1124
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:40,020
these other dogs you got get
the fuck away. I don't want
to lose this. And it was,

1125
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,590
should have been a great pet on by
our own but with the dog to on yours.

1126
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,300
That's my experience.
I've always had,

1127
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:50,630
I had two pit bulls for years and I've
had different sets of them and they just,

1128
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,400
they just try to kill each other.
So good.

1129
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:57,380
So good at getting like choking
them out off each other. But I just,

1130
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,930
I they'd be fighting. And one time I
was on a date and piggy and my, my,

1131
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,830
my uh, my fucking German German
Shepard, this working dog,

1132
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:08,960
this bad ass fucking dog.
Okay.

1133
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:13,340
That I like found this candidate and he
was like a long line of just nothing but

1134
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:14,780
IPO and shuts on sport dogs.

1135
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:19,930
This dog was a fucking wolf and by
the way had knock out drag out fights

1136
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,630
with my dog piggy who is a pure pit bull
and a fight and dog and this dog held

1137
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,270
her own no problem.
Meanwhile, I'm on a day me,

1138
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:30,400
why would you let them find out
how and how do you know the day,

1139
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,420
but there were two females. I want
you there when it happened. Oh, did,

1140
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,720
what would happen was I'd come
home and it looked like Vietnam.

1141
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:40,050
There'd be from everywhere blood
everywhere and they both be like,

1142
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,830
and basically half dead. I'd rush
him to the vet, they'd be like,

1143
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,530
that'll be $5,000.
I was like literally.

1144
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,100
And so Nate fight sometimes I was
on a date, this girl is beautiful.

1145
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:54,930
I remember and all of a sudden I just
here and I come running out and all,

1146
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:58,170
I think his vet bills and they
just gotten out of their cones.

1147
01:02:58,171 --> 01:03:01,950
They used to walk around, they looked
like like Nixon and a baseball combined.

1148
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:06,390
They literally just looked through jowls
and like stitches heal because what

1149
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:08,940
you're saying is the role of swell up.

1150
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:12,930
They had to shave him and then they'd
had these crazy stitches on the shaved

1151
01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:16,980
heads and necks and just swollen
with these jowls. It was awful.

1152
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:19,410
The Giles because fees,
I'd have to train it.

1153
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:22,770
They had the fucking pills and they were
in these cones and knocking everything

1154
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:25,560
over and and so they get
in a fight and I was,

1155
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:28,290
I was in the front yard for 20 minutes
trying to break them up cause I choke one

1156
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:32,100
off. Then that one would
lose consciousness and then
the other one would get,

1157
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,900
get a hold of it and then
I have to choke that one.

1158
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:37,230
I'm dealing when we're getting kind of
20 minutes and my hands after and my

1159
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:40,320
buddy came home, Bob, my buddy came home
and actually helped me break them up.

1160
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:45,160
20 minutes later we're all fucked up.
My hands were so I,

1161
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:48,370
I've been trying to like fight him so
badly. I was literally fun for my lift.

1162
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,560
My hands couldn't, didn't work for for a
week. Go well, you're a pussy garden hose.

1163
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:53,780
Uh,

1164
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:58,650
what to separate some readily tried it
many times with my dogs and they were

1165
01:03:58,651 --> 01:04:03,360
like, ah, this is just cooling us
down in their mouth in their mouth.

1166
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:07,020
Guess what? I talked to the trainer. He
goes, yeah, sometimes when you do that,

1167
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:10,770
some dogs think that's the other dog is
doing it to them and so they fucking go

1168
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:15,450
harder. Yeah. I had both of those don't
stick. It does matter because they'd be,

1169
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,340
hold on. Remember when we went
to that guy's house who was a he?

1170
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:22,890
He raised fighting. Pitbull's got one
of his puppies. The advertisement said,

1171
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:26,130
this is how returning to an hour,
the advertisement said pit bulls.

1172
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,450
There's no bullet. Our pit bread right
out of the box to Joe and I were like,

1173
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:35,490
fighting dogs were in your
stupid like Reem, possibly fast,

1174
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:40,410
accurate or some shit. And we're
just, we drive forever out there.

1175
01:04:40,411 --> 01:04:45,120
This guy's clearly a dog fighter slash
criminal slash whatever serial killer.

1176
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,680
And I buy this dog even as a puppy,
wouldn't let go of your shoe laces.

1177
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:53,670
And it really looked like a beagle. It
was really weird. It was a small dog.

1178
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,660
So anyway, Brian can't take this
dog. He has a dog for a little while,

1179
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:00,470
but it's just too much work. He's
really irresponsible. He doesn't.

1180
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,380
So he gives a dog to his friend on the
farm and the, what does the dog do? Oh,

1181
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,650
my friend called me and goes, hey bro,
your dog's no longer with us. I go, what?

1182
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,610
He goes, yeah, I had to shoot it. I said,
why? He goes, oh, I don't know. Well,

1183
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:15,480
let's see. Got Ahold of the baby cow.
Um, and then, uh, well no, I'm sorry.

1184
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:19,750
Let me start again. It killed one
goat, then another goat and that go,

1185
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:23,020
got caught up in, it's in, it's a rope.

1186
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:27,160
And then started bleeding as it died
and then the cows started moving,

1187
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,950
so the dog was like,
oh baby cow grabbed on that.

1188
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,240
Then the de the neighbor did German
shepherd came out to protect the cow and

1189
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:38,050
your dog broke both his legs.
Okay, it's pine legs and he said,

1190
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:41,980
and I had a 55 pound dog that
looked like it was a hundred pounds.

1191
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:45,340
It was so full of blood. It was just,
it was just so swollen with blood lust.

1192
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,010
And he said, I'd never seen anything
like it. It couldn't get it off then.

1193
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,040
Then after the German shepard goes
back to the cow, the baby cow.

1194
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,950
So my buddy is trying to get it
off the baby cow and you have to,

1195
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:57,490
you have a real responsibility when you
have a dog white though, those dogs,

1196
01:05:57,491 --> 01:06:01,210
they have too,
too much of a history of blood lust.

1197
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:06,070
It's too hard for them to break. Pray
with people to hell on wheels with four,

1198
01:06:06,071 --> 01:06:09,130
four legs, great with people. You
just, if you have a dog like that,

1199
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,740
you have to have it in a secure yard
and you have to be with it all the time

1200
01:06:11,741 --> 01:06:12,970
because otherwise you've got a monster.

1201
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,000
You used them to hunt
boar or fight other dogs.

1202
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:19,780
That's what pimples or the way that's
also pigman either see when they have them

1203
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:22,650
that way they hold them down with the
dogs and then they cut the things.

1204
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:26,860
It's not as crazy as the
watching the helicopter shit.

1205
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:31,290
The helicopter thing was insane. The whole
show too. It's a whole half hour show.

1206
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,100
Those are military style weapons.

1207
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:36,610
It was like he was talking about
this before with a fully automatic,

1208
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,870
when they hit the pigs and the pigs
are running and then they would do the

1209
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,750
somersaults when they would like
brain. Um, and then the pigs,

1210
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:48,760
pigs would go face down into the mud flip.
It's pretty fucking nuts, man. One pig,

1211
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:53,590
they get to this one pig,
this giant boar and he fucking turns,

1212
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:57,940
stops running and faces the helicopter,
like face down the helicopter.

1213
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,420
Look at this motherfucker.
No Way.

1214
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:06,310
They opened up on them and then
you see twitching kickin and shit.

1215
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,010
They got him in the water.
Some of them went in the water nice.

1216
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,880
And as her in the water,
don't, I don't talk to them.

1217
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:13,150
You see their heads explode in the water.

1218
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:17,140
Like this is the most carnage I have
ever seen on television and Mrs fucking

1219
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:20,750
crazy to watch. You know, and
they're, they're fucking redneck.

1220
01:07:20,751 --> 01:07:23,620
So they're hooting and hollering
while pay 10 Nigga was like,

1221
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,800
people think you should be illegal.
It should be illegal not to do it.

1222
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:29,710
He's not exactly a middle of the road guy.

1223
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:32,710
You don't kill a hundred pigs before
breakfast. You're a communist.

1224
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:38,090
Just fucking shooting,
shooting at them out of this.

1225
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:41,860
He was having a great time. Yeah. He
was like, if I always too many bullets,

1226
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:43,330
Mrs Nugent will divorce me.

1227
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,930
I was in Portugal and I saw a bull fight
and I was surprised at my own reaction.

1228
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:49,240
I got really mad at how they
were treating that bull.

1229
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:52,570
It made me feel really bad for the bull
and I was fucking actively rooting for

1230
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:53,780
it to kill one of those guys.

1231
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:58,700
Will they do and every now and then
they do the last one when the guy had to

1232
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,780
kill it to shoot it,
you know, don't hurt it.

1233
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,400
You've seen the horn with the
horn goes through the guys.

1234
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,710
It's the crazy shit I've ever seen
in my life by the way. He, I think,

1235
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:09,280
I believe he came back and fought like,
couldn't find any more,

1236
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:12,180
but he fought a symbolic thing and
they were all cheering for him.

1237
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,631
That's a bad ass.

1238
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:17,270
And you want to read the definitive book
on bullfighting and it's really worth

1239
01:08:17,271 --> 01:08:19,270
it.
It's called death in the afternoon by um,

1240
01:08:19,271 --> 01:08:24,140
by Ernest timing the way it's an amazing
book. One guy had it through his mouth,

1241
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,070
through his lower jaw and coming out
of this mouth. Yup. That those guys,

1242
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:31,670
that's a bad ass. That's a bad ass
sport. I will. It's not a sport,

1243
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,060
it's a crazy custom that you
custom vent to customers.

1244
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,930
It's one of those things where
you could invent it today.

1245
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,210
Do you know that the law in Spain,
you can,

1246
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:45,200
you're not allowed to approach a
fighting bull on foot as a human being.

1247
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:49,280
You have to approach it either on bicycle
or in a car or in a motorcycle. Why?

1248
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,100
Because those fighting bulls are
smart enough. They can, they watch,

1249
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:55,670
they watch how you move and
they learned very quickly.

1250
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,360
They learned very quickly how so the first
time at Bullen inner ring sees a man.

1251
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,690
It's the first time he's ever seen
a man on, on two feet. So he's not,

1252
01:09:02,691 --> 01:09:06,410
he does not know her moves. And a, there's
a whole thing that they do with that,

1253
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,220
you know, that's important. You don't want
to have that uneven fight. Did you know,

1254
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:10,490
you know,

1255
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:15,230
they used to pit lions and also bears
on with both the short and bear baiting.

1256
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:18,800
Guess, guess, guess who won every
one of those fights? Now the bowls,

1257
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:22,220
I mean the bullets when they'd have
bulls against the lion or bulls against a

1258
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:27,170
bear. Oh, bowls, bowls won every time.
Every time. Jesus. Every fucking time.

1259
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:31,460
That's what Hemingway says. And the things
they, they, they, they, they, you're,

1260
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:34,400
you're not, you're not fucking with,
uh, with, uh, they can lift the horse.

1261
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:37,250
Speaking of which,
speaking of which,

1262
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:41,660
did you see the youtube video of the bull
elephant that took the Mack truck got

1263
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:44,930
under it with his tasks cause he was mad
at the Mack truck cause he fell out of

1264
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:48,770
it and, and flip that shit over.
He fell out of the truck. Yeah,

1265
01:09:48,771 --> 01:09:50,180
they were trying to
load them on the truck,

1266
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:53,120
I guess any fell out of
it and was like fuck this.

1267
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:58,510
And he got under that Mack truck and
it's a real Mack truck and flipped it.

1268
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:04,190
So turn to right over on its side.
So do you have any question of how strong,

1269
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:07,250
and by the way,
they weighed 10,000 pounds.

1270
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,440
A bull elephant weighs 10,000 pounds.
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1271
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:13,240
Jesus Christ,
that's big enough for you.

1272
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,560
I wonder who would win an elephant or
a bull and they're really smart and you

1273
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:19,420
can train and do all kinds of crazy shit.

1274
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,960
Well what's really smart about
them as the memory there,

1275
01:10:21,961 --> 01:10:25,180
they can see another elephant
which all looks the same to us,

1276
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,520
but they don't see it for 10
years and then they run into it.

1277
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:31,690
They run towards each other and hug
each other humans too. That's crazy man.

1278
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,490
They know who you are and they
don't like certain people.

1279
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:35,710
And I was in the San Diego
Zoo and I was watching them.

1280
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:39,830
We paid extra to go and see them, how
they clean them and how they, you know,

1281
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,790
teach them to bring, give them your,
have to say you can check them and stuff.

1282
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:47,020
So they always have a barrier and
they're no joke. There's no a video.

1283
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,990
Is there a um, it's gotta be yeah,
there's no, uh, it's not elephant.

1284
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:57,650
I think flipping Mack truck or something.
Yeah, just put it on or flipping drunk.

1285
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,500
Elephant versus drunk elephant.

1286
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:06,550
I had to do it for a, I did it
for a true TV. They sent it to me.

1287
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:10,840
Oh really? Well what is it
like, I'm assuming the DVD,

1288
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:15,360
what is a true TV? Like a
show or something? I just
thing called world's dumbest.

1289
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:19,380
Like world's dumbest. Oh, like one of
those things where you make fun of people,

1290
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:23,970
comments, like make comments and stuff.
That stuff's on the way out. I think so,

1291
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,130
yeah. TV something way out.
It's doing well though.

1292
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,200
All those silly shows were on the way out.
Well,

1293
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:31,170
what do you think is going to
replace the Internet? Yeah, yeah.

1294
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:35,340
What's that mean for us?
It means that a podcast man,

1295
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:36,980
thoughts at Brian Callan
I got to come up with,

1296
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:38,810
that's what you're
calling it now, man. Man.

1297
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:43,730
Thoughts change it from the council
to, ma'am, I can label it now. Oh,

1298
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,800
we couldn't label it the
Brian [inaudible] show before.

1299
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,730
This is more specific and it's kind of
what I think about I and I, and I'm,

1300
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,050
you know, a man thoughts can
comprise a lot of different things,

1301
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,300
but I'm trying to think
of what I'm going to,

1302
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:58,410
I've got to make some tee shirts that
I would wear because I, you know,

1303
01:11:58,411 --> 01:12:00,360
I don't know. And not that I
didn't want to sell them, I just,

1304
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:03,180
I'm just gonna like I'm
particular about my tee shirts.

1305
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:07,440
How about just a little tiny
Cox over tiny ones? Let's see.

1306
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:10,740
How about an image and the image? Really
cool image and image of Ronald Reagan,

1307
01:12:10,741 --> 01:12:15,030
but it's all made out of Cox. No, I
should've called my podcast Cox. Cox,

1308
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,780
Dick.
Fuck,

1309
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:23,690
that's a funny name for a
company called epic but doesn't,

1310
01:12:23,691 --> 01:12:26,370
um, someone has deke house
or something like that.

1311
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,340
That's a Knoxville. Yeah. Yeah.

1312
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,590
My Buddy, my buddy is doing a movie
with them. You can get away with that.

1313
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:39,390
It's weird. Like I watched a CNN
the other day and there was a,

1314
01:12:39,391 --> 01:12:44,140
there's a band in Russia called Pussy
riot plus your ride and pussy riot broken

1315
01:12:44,141 --> 01:12:48,510
to a church. They got arrested, they got
arrested two years and yeah, they got,

1316
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,040
they got sentenced to like two years
in jail and so everybody was having a

1317
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:58,041
demonstration and they have these giant
signs that say free pussy riot and here

1318
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,820
CNN,

1319
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:04,590
it's showing this on CNN and I'm sitting
in front of the TV and these giant

1320
01:13:04,591 --> 01:13:08,580
signs say free pussy riot. And
I'm like, wow, that's hilarious.

1321
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:12,360
Like what a weird loophole by the way
they, because they called it pussy riot.

1322
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:15,420
Yeah, they have to, they
have to show what these guys,

1323
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,550
that's blatantly obscene,

1324
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,060
but it's on the news.
You know,

1325
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:24,780
I was on a plane one time and the guy
started having an argument with the

1326
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,940
stewardess before we took off.

1327
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,790
All of a sudden he's just
saying he's not being a dick.

1328
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:32,490
He's just saying some things like, well,
I'm not trying to cause a problem here.

1329
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:35,160
You know, as I'm like, oh there's a guy,
I'm going to cause a riot, whatever.

1330
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,460
And so next thing you know,
Marshall's or on the plane,

1331
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,030
they take them off the plant
and what's going on? Well,

1332
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,550
you're not allowed to use the
word riot on their certain,

1333
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:47,390
we have certain trigger words
that we have to report. Uh,

1334
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,500
because you could have been a terrorist.

1335
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:53,010
We were trying to incite violence and
this is the kind of fucking bureaucratic

1336
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,390
shit we deal with Jesus.

1337
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,990
That's what happens when you had these
blanket laws and these absolute rules.

1338
01:13:57,991 --> 01:14:02,290
It's like fucking laws. It's too, too
much ridiculous how many pages the,

1339
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,790
and I'm reading a book about it and I
think it's not a bad, not such a bad law.

1340
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:06,780
There's a lot to like about it.

1341
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:08,850
But you know how many pages
the Obamacare act as you know,

1342
01:14:08,851 --> 01:14:13,750
how many pages in the bill?
2,420 now who reads it?

1343
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:17,080
Nobody. Thank you. That's a good
and especially you don't read.

1344
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,870
You also don't read the clauses you
put in there. Who reads it? Uh, the,

1345
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:22,571
the uh,

1346
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:26,530
handful of reporters from the New York
Post who put out a book called landmark

1347
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:31,390
that I'm reading now that really explains
what the Obamacare bill does and what

1348
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:33,860
it means for us.
Listen that the thing about bills or the,

1349
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:38,380
they'll sneak shit in that has almost
nothing to do with the name of the bill

1350
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:41,290
just so that they can get it in and stuff
they've been trying to get in before.

1351
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:44,350
My father said, the best thing
about it, my father said Washington,

1352
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,860
he spent a lot of time on Capitol Hill
and he said, and this is a podcast.

1353
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,920
He goes,
Lushington isn't the business of intent.

1354
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:54,250
What that means is that you have a bill.

1355
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,250
You want to create universal healthcare
or do you want to do whatever? You know,

1356
01:14:57,251 --> 01:15:01,250
these are good ideas. That
is the intention. Whatever.

1357
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,950
What happens with a Goliath of Goliath,
like Waa, like the federal government,

1358
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,400
is that there are so many vested interests
that find their way into that law.

1359
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:15,280
So if you want me to vote for it,
that's fine.

1360
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,050
You got to do something
for my constituency,

1361
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:20,800
which means I've got to put this clause
in page 500 no one's gonna read it

1362
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:25,090
anyway, don't worry about it. And before
you know it, that law that passed,

1363
01:15:25,091 --> 01:15:26,170
just like the marijuana laws,

1364
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,950
there was a cottage industry that grows
up around those laws that have a vested

1365
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:32,740
interest in keeping that law,
no matter whether it makes sense or not.

1366
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:34,900
And that's what happens.

1367
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,200
That's all of a sudden everybody's
drinking out of the government trough.

1368
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:41,350
It comes down to very simple questions,
not Republican or Democrat.

1369
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,210
This is why you say,

1370
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:48,360
do you want the majority of our resources
in Washington under this massive roof?

1371
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:53,050
Or does it make sense to spread
the resources somewhere else?

1372
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,430
That's the big question,

1373
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,420
and I happen to believe it's better to
keep resources out of Washington because

1374
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:01,000
something that big can't help but create.

1375
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:04,270
The real problem is you can't
untangle it. Now. It's so far.

1376
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:08,000
Everybody's got their hand in.
Do you think, do you, how do you,

1377
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,920
do you know the kind of tax breaks at
pharmaceutical companies get because they

1378
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:16,300
own the FDA. Nobody else can break
into the drug business. You know why?

1379
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,400
Because they own the scientist basically
that say Yay or nay. It takes, what,

1380
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:23,890
12 or 13 years to get a drug patent?

1381
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:26,980
You've got to go through all the tests
and they're, they're scientists. Go,

1382
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:30,070
wait a minute, I've gotta be very
careful. They all take money from Pfizer,

1383
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:33,430
et Cetera. Of course. Well, that's what
we were talking about before the podcast.

1384
01:16:33,431 --> 01:16:36,830
When it comes to our hump
force, a protein, it's,

1385
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:40,990
we have to buy all of our hemp Canada
because the pharmaceutical companies have

1386
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,700
bribed these fucking corrupt politicians
and made sure that it's illegal.

1387
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,470
The federal federal government,

1388
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:52,850
the state government voted for it and
the whole thing is supposed to be that

1389
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:55,000
states are allowed to make their own laws.

1390
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,210
The federal government is not supposed
to interfere with things along these

1391
01:16:58,211 --> 01:17:02,320
lines and they don't give a fuck. They'll
put you in jail if you just grow hemp,

1392
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,930
which is a cousin of marijuana.
So let,

1393
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,660
let me tell you another story
that's really interesting.

1394
01:17:06,661 --> 01:17:08,590
A friend of mine unfortunately
has pancreatic cancer.

1395
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,450
I lost my other friend to it,
um, about three months ago,

1396
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:14,300
but suddenly my friend's mom,
step mom has it and,

1397
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:19,550
and she went to a doctor,
doctor gave her up chemo protocol.

1398
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,210
Uh, just like with my friend was given
a chemo protocol and these are very good

1399
01:17:23,211 --> 01:17:26,390
doctors at a very well renowned hospital.
Um,

1400
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:31,010
and the drugs costs a fortune. They
fight. It wasn't working that well.

1401
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,070
They finally get into this,
the most famous,

1402
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:38,030
the most famous doctor in the world
for pancreatic cancer at Ucla,

1403
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,870
who's chemo protocol is a,
extends a lot of lives,

1404
01:17:41,871 --> 01:17:45,830
way beyond what you're supposed
to pancreatic cancer. He
said, basically, he said,

1405
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:49,670
why are you on this? He said, he said, he
said, oh, I'm going to change your chemo,

1406
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:51,830
um, and it's going to be a lot cheaper.
And they said, what do you mean? He said,

1407
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:56,810
well, Eli Whitney put out a, uh,
something that costs $30,000 a year,

1408
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,260
but it was the exact same thing as
the generic drug or whatever the,

1409
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:03,650
the other chemo is that was $300 a year.

1410
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,420
But Eli Whitney cleaned it was better.
So every doctor to this day,

1411
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:11,180
I'm going to just follow me.
Every doctor to this day, um,

1412
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:13,190
prescribes the Eli Whitney drug,

1413
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:18,191
which is 30 times more expensive now
ready that Eli Whitney was challenged in

1414
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:22,130
court. This doctor was one of the
people that say, it's, it's bullshit.

1415
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,570
It is actually not as effective or not.
It's this one, which is much cheaper.

1416
01:18:26,571 --> 01:18:28,220
It's been around much longer.
It's just as effective.

1417
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,230
Eli Whitney paid a fine for it.

1418
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:35,500
It was worth it to Eli Whitney to pay
that fine and be dishonest because people

1419
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:39,550
still stay. They're not following all
the tort laws. And then I follow him.

1420
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,180
All the cases,
doctors,

1421
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:45,320
all of the countries still prescribed
the Eli Whitney drug, even though,

1422
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,040
even though it is not as good as the
one they could because they don't know

1423
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:50,810
anybody better because they thought,

1424
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:53,390
because Eli Whitney hired
this huge marketing campaign,

1425
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,260
they thought that's the drug to do now
is the real problem is that nobody calls

1426
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:59,240
him on it. That's right.
Well even if you do,

1427
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:03,440
it costs them $20 million when they
make billions of dollars. So, so again,

1428
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:08,030
these are massive companies that, that
don't really, that have, you know,

1429
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:12,350
have basically hired who they want to
defend them and behave inappropriately.

1430
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:16,490
I'm being, I'm not saying all big farmers
bad, I'm not saying everybody's there.

1431
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:21,650
I think anytime you have four major
players and nobody can get in your fucking

1432
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:25,190
industry, it's not good for
capitalism. It's not capitalism.

1433
01:19:25,191 --> 01:19:29,150
It's not a free market and it's not good
for our health and it's not good for

1434
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,110
humanity as a whole. So there
the, the, that's what it is.

1435
01:19:32,111 --> 01:19:34,520
A real problem is how do you untangle it?
I mean,

1436
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:37,810
there's so much money invested
in keeping Gov's only one way.

1437
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:41,780
There's only one way. You've got
to starve government now. That's,

1438
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,860
that's where the libertarian notion of
the Cato Institute basically says there's

1439
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:49,280
responsible tax while you have to
have some taxes. Uh, but, but you,

1440
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:50,360
the only way,

1441
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:54,410
the only way we're ever going to get out
of this and not become western Europe

1442
01:19:54,411 --> 01:19:56,240
or worse is by,

1443
01:19:56,450 --> 01:20:00,880
by starving that that massive
Leviathan of resources. Yeah.

1444
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:04,300
It is a problem when you create a bunch
of different government jobs, like,

1445
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:04,761
you know,

1446
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:09,510
there's a lot of people that rallied to
keep drugs illegal and one of them is

1447
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:14,160
the unions that control guards,
prison guards, prison guard unions,

1448
01:20:14,161 --> 01:20:17,970
and they spend a lot of money from their
dues that they get from their workers

1449
01:20:17,971 --> 01:20:20,010
in order to keep drug laws the same.
Yeah.

1450
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:23,760
Because that's what keeps them
working and what's not a philosophy.

1451
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,710
It is self-interest. Yes, absolutely.
Self interest. And it's scary. That works.

1452
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:32,110
It's scary that that would be allowed.
It's scary that that doesn't prompt.

1453
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,260
I mean if you were an
insider trading guy knew,

1454
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:39,120
just knew that some company was about to
go under and you got rid of your stock,

1455
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:44,100
you'd go to fucking jail for that.
How come you can't go to jail for that?

1456
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:48,270
How come you can't go to jail?
Because you are, you're, you're,

1457
01:20:48,271 --> 01:20:51,270
we are working to keep drug drug laws,

1458
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:54,900
which everybody has shown a ridiculous
and most people believe are completely

1459
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:58,740
ridiculous despite the massive
amount of propaganda that you do,

1460
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:03,150
the way you do it. You, you, you get
yourself informed, get yourself informed,

1461
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:06,540
get yourself organized.
And what happens is it takes a long time.

1462
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:11,430
But pretty soon more and more people
start to say even about don't smoke weed.

1463
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:16,640
This is a ridiculous law that's puts
so many people in jail for a long,

1464
01:21:17,101 --> 01:21:20,910
long time. Not only a taxpayer stance,
it's ruined families and everything else.

1465
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,043
And,
uh,

1466
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:26,280
when are we going to come to our senses
and realize that this should not be

1467
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:29,700
illegal? And, and if you get enough
people behind the politician,

1468
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:34,110
things start to change. The way you
do it though is through information.

1469
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:37,680
And also I, I, my biggest problem
with government now is I feel,

1470
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:40,760
I don't feel like I'm represented. I
just feel like, well, you're not, yeah,

1471
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:44,580
the no one is anymore. I mean,
Obama's not even represented.

1472
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,460
That's where special interests
are. That's, that's the problem.

1473
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:50,100
They're supposed to cancel each other
out and they're not him as a human.

1474
01:21:50,101 --> 01:21:51,780
He's not represented.
I don't,

1475
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:54,810
I don't think that guy has any say in
what the fuck happens. I really don't.

1476
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:57,870
I think at the whole thing is completely
ridiculous. Without Congress. I mean,

1477
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,700
you know, that's not
necessarily a bad, I mean,

1478
01:21:59,701 --> 01:22:02,700
but you don't necessarily want a
president to have too much power.

1479
01:22:02,701 --> 01:22:05,570
But the president sets
the agenda and the upper,

1480
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:08,070
the president's responsibilities
always to do a, set the agenda.

1481
01:22:08,071 --> 01:22:10,470
But also also at the end of the day,

1482
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,370
there are a lot of decisions where he's
presented with six different options

1483
01:22:14,371 --> 01:22:17,070
from six different interest groups and
he's got to make a decision and piss off

1484
01:22:17,071 --> 01:22:21,630
the other five. Yeah. But he's don't,
don't show in front of the camera, Bro.

1485
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:25,870
That's disgusting. I know I got, I got,
I looked at that pickle and I was like,

1486
01:22:25,871 --> 01:22:28,230
I've got to have one. You can't do
that. You can't chew it. A microphone.

1487
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,840
I know it's a little bit about the United
States won't, they won't tell you that.

1488
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:36,600
It's probably Nsh redact this.
Uh, this William Binney is,

1489
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:40,140
this guy was the NSA mathematician that
I was telling you about earlier. Um,

1490
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:43,590
I've been obsessed with this guy
since we have had David Seaman on,

1491
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:48,591
on Monday who was a congressional
candidate in Florida and this former NSA

1492
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:54,470
director after nine 11. It, this
guy is a mathematician, you know,

1493
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,050
um, one of the world's
renowned math mathematicians.

1494
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:03,530
And what he did was create a
method for the government to,

1495
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:09,170
uh, track dangerous individuals and
track people and, and, and, and book.

1496
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,240
It turned out that the government
just used it openly on everyone.

1497
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,400
And so he had to leave.
What a surprise.

1498
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:19,810
They just decided to just literally
every phone call that you make this guy's

1499
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:22,420
correct. And he is the guy
who fucking coated this shit.

1500
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:26,170
If at every phone call that you make,
every text message you make,

1501
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:30,400
every email you make goes into a database
and the government is in Utah building

1502
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:35,140
a gigantic structure that will
literally house everything you do, say,

1503
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:39,790
watch online, all your Internet
history, all that shit will be stored.

1504
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:44,620
So if they ever want to just anything
they want to know about you, anything,

1505
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:46,990
all they have to do is just pull
that. Shut up guys, if you want,

1506
01:23:46,991 --> 01:23:49,330
if you want to see somebody who really
sat around and thought about this stuff

1507
01:23:49,331 --> 01:23:53,080
and made the argument for why
that's not good, just youtube.

1508
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:55,990
Milton Friedman. Well let's
before that, before that,

1509
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:57,340
let's not get people confused.

1510
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:02,140
Let's let's have people just check out
this story and the guy's name is Benny, B,

1511
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:03,820
I n n,
e y,

1512
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:08,020
and just go and read up on
this because just this alone,

1513
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:12,490
it's going to fuck with your head and
what are they doing on some important

1514
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,940
chopping wood? No, you hear that banging.

1515
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:18,690
That's like someone's going
to drum fucking lives.

1516
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,900
They think they could keep the kids from
banging on a drum in the hallway. No,

1517
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:26,080
that's passive aggressive shit right there
buddy. That's what that is. They don't,

1518
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:28,260
they don't like the fact that we're in
here having fun while they were out there

1519
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:29,380
with the kid screaming.
No.

1520
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,950
My mother used to do to get my father
to get back to my dad for years.

1521
01:24:32,951 --> 01:24:36,070
The household I grew up and my dad
would always travel and pain in the ass.

1522
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:38,320
A lot of pressure and everything
else. My mother would, uh,

1523
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:41,170
she'd always have part of the
house being worked on by man.

1524
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:45,160
She just have part of the house always
not in repair and love that shit.

1525
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:48,520
And my father basically in a bad mood,
it wouldn't know what it's like, oh,

1526
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:52,960
I'm just having the kitchen redone
for the second time. They didn't know.

1527
01:24:52,961 --> 01:24:56,020
They love doing that. They love
it. They love like changing things

1528
01:24:57,870 --> 01:25:02,830
change. It's different. Like you
could, you could live in a log cabin.

1529
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,920
Easy. Right. Me Too. I was in
college. It was three guys. Okay.

1530
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,950
We didn't do the dishes for one month.
We had,

1531
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:13,170
we had sprouts growing out of the
train for real. Okay. Finally did.

1532
01:25:13,171 --> 01:25:15,040
My girlfriend came over and she
was like so appalled. She goes,

1533
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:17,290
I have to clean this. I can't
take it. I can't be around here.

1534
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:21,000
And it smells like a greenhouse.
You know,

1535
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:24,190
guys are guys are pigs folks.

1536
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:28,690
So this binny guy, you gotta, you
gotta there's, there's youtube videos.

1537
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:32,530
If you don't want to, uh,
to sit and read something.

1538
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,000
National Security Agency,

1539
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:39,000
whistleblower William Binney look
into that because this is, uh,

1540
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:43,210
we, we, we've turned a corner
in our society where this is a,

1541
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:47,650
it's an us against them.
Shit. It shouldn't be. And
remember also that every,

1542
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:51,970
every totalitarian state and every state
that took control and power over people

1543
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:55,490
used,
used national security and,

1544
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:59,530
and domestic security and the
threat of terrorism, et Cetera,

1545
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:04,400
as an excuse to take away your liberty.
It's so old schools.

1546
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:05,900
You would think they've always been done.

1547
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:10,820
I would think that that generation had
already moved out of business. You know,

1548
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:15,620
I hate to think that the generation
coming up is going to go business as usual

1549
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:18,710
because in my mind,
this generation,

1550
01:26:18,711 --> 01:26:23,711
the generation that's of age of adult age
now grew up with the Internet and that

1551
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:28,400
generation is a different
group of human beings, vastly,

1552
01:26:28,401 --> 01:26:31,370
vastly different than anybody that
grew up in the sixties or seventies,

1553
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:32,960
two completely different animals.

1554
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:36,770
Thomas Jefferson said that the price
of freedom is eternal vigilance.

1555
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:39,620
And part of, part of that,
what he's trying to say,

1556
01:26:39,621 --> 01:26:43,070
I think in a lot of ways is that you,
you may have your freedom,

1557
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:48,050
but just know that it can be taken away
from you, uh, a lot faster than you think.

1558
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:52,670
So you've gotta be very aware of the
signs read. That's why you read history,

1559
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:54,170
cause you perspective and
you're real and you can,

1560
01:26:54,171 --> 01:26:57,830
you can recognize patterns and
destructive patterns and destructive.

1561
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:59,330
But nobody saw this coming.

1562
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:02,740
Nobody saw the ability to do this because
my mother saw it coming and there lots

1563
01:27:02,741 --> 01:27:06,170
of them monitoring their,
the NSA had mathematicians.

1564
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,560
There are a lot of people that saw this
company I talked to about the fact that

1565
01:27:09,561 --> 01:27:10,460
it's already going on and let's,

1566
01:27:10,461 --> 01:27:13,220
William Binney had stepped out
and put his book by the way.

1567
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:16,430
They broke into his house and stuck
a fucking gun in his face to the FBI,

1568
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:18,690
came into his house and it,
and he never did anything wrong.

1569
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,070
I didn't do anything wrong.
The whole thing is crazy.

1570
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:26,030
We have a that just to really
fucking creepy, corrupt,

1571
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:29,960
corrupt government being in
control of that which governs you,

1572
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:33,530
which is what our country is based on,
has always been a very tenuous,

1573
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:38,540
fragile arrangement and it's gotta be
defended every minute of the day and they

1574
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:41,810
just need to stop. It
just needs, we need to,

1575
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:45,290
we need to have new people in
government and with this new,

1576
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,780
the new transparency that
exists because of the Internet,

1577
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:49,760
you're going to be able
to still run things,

1578
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:52,940
but you can't run things as corrupt
as they had been running forever and

1579
01:27:52,941 --> 01:27:55,040
everybody just wants to keep doing it.

1580
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:59,690
Just like we were talking about
circumcision or bull fighting or anything.

1581
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:04,070
That's ridiculous. It's old. It's in
nature. It's government. It's not people.

1582
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:08,300
It's the bigger it becomes, the bigger
it becomes. Government needs a job.

1583
01:28:08,301 --> 01:28:11,840
And what does that job to either
tax or pass laws, both of them.

1584
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:14,300
Of course the measures you,
you, you are going to have them.

1585
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:17,630
The bigger government grows,
the more history shows you,

1586
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:21,180
the bigger government grows,
the more, the more you know,

1587
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:25,790
the more power they get
over you as an individual.

1588
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,060
And that if just pick up
a history book, man. Yeah.

1589
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:31,880
But is there a way to pull it
back? That's the question. That's,

1590
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:36,050
that's the biggest question.
That's the biggest way to run things.

1591
01:28:36,051 --> 01:28:38,780
There's a way where
people pay a fair amount.

1592
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:43,790
There's a way where we keep
a real military that keeps
us from ever being at the

1593
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:47,030
mercy of an evil dictator
or an evil country.

1594
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,740
Is there a way to do that and still
be a good country and still not be

1595
01:28:51,741 --> 01:28:53,690
completely and totally corrupt?
Yes.

1596
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:58,430
Or is educate yourself and you and
you get informed, educate yourself.

1597
01:28:58,431 --> 01:29:00,290
That's not going to stop
them from running over.

1598
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:02,040
You have to make you have that much power.
You've gotta

1599
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:06,240
vote you gotta you gotta make noise.
Is Voting real well? If it is,

1600
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:09,840
why did Ron Paul, I mean, why did he
lose two states that he clearly won?

1601
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:10,890
Do you know that there's a,

1602
01:29:10,891 --> 01:29:15,390
there's plenty of evidence online and
this plenty of videos and show that show

1603
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:19,310
in Maine and there was one other state
were Ron Paul should have one and they,

1604
01:29:19,311 --> 01:29:20,610
they, they hit it, they covered it.

1605
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,580
I think that is that our
voting process is fairly,

1606
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:27,810
it's actually compared to most parts of
the world compared to most parts of the

1607
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:29,560
world. Did you see hacking democracy? No.

1608
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:33,750
Hacking democracy makes it very strong
argument that the Bush Kerry election was

1609
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:36,180
bought that if you watched the video,

1610
01:29:36,181 --> 01:29:40,680
it's a documentary on Hbo when they show
that they engineered in a third party

1611
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:45,681
entrant into these voting machines and
the guy on the show Diebold had to change

1612
01:29:46,051 --> 01:29:48,150
their name and I'm Diebold anymore.
There's something else.

1613
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:52,140
The guy on the show showed how he can
alter the results of, of any electric.

1614
01:29:52,141 --> 01:29:56,220
Doesn't surprise me. Yeah. So what do we
do? That's a good question. The Internet.

1615
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,113
That's what I think.

1616
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,280
I think the only thing that's gonna save
us is the young people coming up know

1617
01:30:01,281 --> 01:30:02,400
that this is a different world.

1618
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,860
Know that this is a world that if
you're going to be a politician,

1619
01:30:04,861 --> 01:30:07,050
you're going to be completely,
you've got to be transparent,

1620
01:30:07,051 --> 01:30:08,250
everything's going to be transparent.

1621
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:12,470
Every move you make and you can't get
away with doing things that we've done for

1622
01:30:12,471 --> 01:30:15,330
for decades and decades before.
It's a totally new game. Yeah.

1623
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,420
That's the only thing that's,
it makes sense to me. You know,

1624
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:21,510
the idea of overthrowing
the government like that,

1625
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:25,020
is that a really fucking necessarily like
everybody's getting bonkers about that.

1626
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,500
Throw the government, first of all,
it's, it's not a whole other thing.

1627
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:32,430
There are ways to overthrow or change
the power structure or make it smaller.

1628
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,280
What's also people
recognize in this country,

1629
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:39,960
especially that we are the cops.
We are the military.

1630
01:30:39,961 --> 01:30:44,340
It's not the actual elite is these
creepy bankers and there's only a fuck on

1631
01:30:44,341 --> 01:30:47,130
small handful of them.
And if the military doesn't listen,

1632
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:49,560
and if the government doesn't listen,
there's,

1633
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:52,950
then it does take your phone away from
the table, please take your phone. Yeah.

1634
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:58,020
It's making that [inaudible] if that's,
if we do that.

1635
01:30:58,230 --> 01:30:59,960
Yeah. So the phones, um,

1636
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,270
especially a CDMA phones or a GSM phones,

1637
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,420
there's a signal that picks up,
it's good. It does it in your car.

1638
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:10,370
Sometimes they were doing your car
and you're staring up. He goes, oh,

1639
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:12,930
that's my problem. That's your
phone, your phone. It's, it's,

1640
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:15,450
it's at and t phones if you,
yeah.

1641
01:31:15,451 --> 01:31:17,310
If you had Verizon and
wouldn't do it as easily.

1642
01:31:17,370 --> 01:31:21,030
So it's sort of a different frequency
apparently. You know, CDMA is a,

1643
01:31:21,031 --> 01:31:25,860
an older frequency. The frequency of
the Verizon uses, but apparently it, uh,

1644
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:29,640
it's different in that, uh,
it's, um, it's more robust.

1645
01:31:29,641 --> 01:31:32,520
It goes deeper into buildings.
But more countries have GSM.

1646
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,540
Like my iPhone has both. So if I
go on the roads, Verizon phones,

1647
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:37,890
so if I go on the road,
if I'm an England,

1648
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:40,050
it'll work in England
because they only have GSM.

1649
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:45,460
They gave up on our stupid
CDMA. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1650
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:49,500
but just, I just, uh, when,
when it comes to these,

1651
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:52,260
these fucking conversations,
they always seem so circular.

1652
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:55,170
Like they never really go anywhere because
they're frustrating because you don't,

1653
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,760
you don't really know what the hell
to do about this problem. That that's,

1654
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,160
that's what's scary about

1655
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,520
it. And that's, that's the biggest
threat is the growth of the state.

1656
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,030
The real question is, does, does voting
really work anymore? And it voting.

1657
01:32:07,031 --> 01:32:10,030
Those are good questions. We've got a real
fucking problem. Really good question.

1658
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:12,790
Because what you start to realize
there's not a major difference between

1659
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:15,790
candidates. Is there, I mean, did
they, all of a sudden you go, well,

1660
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:18,910
there's not a big difference.
People are disenfranchised. I mean,

1661
01:32:18,911 --> 01:32:20,850
people aren't voting,
uh,

1662
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:24,400
young people aren't as angry or in
the streets because there's not a,

1663
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:26,140
you can't really necessarily
make a difference.

1664
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,000
Maybe that's how people have always felt.

1665
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:30,400
I do think people felt that
way in the 60s, actually,

1666
01:32:30,401 --> 01:32:34,030
which is why they gotten to the streets
and they tried to make a lot of noise,

1667
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:38,320
but that either I have the amount
of movement that we have today.

1668
01:32:38,321 --> 01:32:40,470
They didn't have the ability to do things.

1669
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,380
And I's governments were taken
down with Facebook. I mean,

1670
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:48,000
Facebook took down governments,
Twitter took down. Different ones are,

1671
01:32:48,001 --> 01:32:51,460
a lot of people are arguing and making
very good arguments like the Cato

1672
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,770
Institute,
this Libertarian think tank about what,

1673
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:57,520
that's why sometimes you
just say philosophically,

1674
01:32:57,670 --> 01:33:01,570
philosophically nobody wants people to
go hungry. And so philosophically though,

1675
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:03,400
as government gets bigger,

1676
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:07,270
more and more people will
start manipulating and
getting their hands into the

1677
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:12,010
cookie jar. It doesn't do anybody
any good man. There's no way.

1678
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,500
There's no way to stop that.
Once it gets to a certain size,

1679
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,530
manageable governments should be
treated like a necessary evil,

1680
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:21,310
not this massive socially social,
uh,

1681
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:25,660
machine that engineer's
equality artificially.

1682
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,390
It can't tell that never has been
able to do that. And it's not,

1683
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,760
it shouldn't do that. Oh,
gross was at Obama's statement.

1684
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:35,560
If you have a small business, you didn't
build up by herself. Well, exactly.

1685
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,980
You know why? Because he's never run a
business and themselves that, that's my,

1686
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:41,320
my knock on that guy.
Don't think he's a bad guy.

1687
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:42,970
Don't think he's not a smart guy.
I don't think that guys,

1688
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:44,110
I've lived in the real fucking world.

1689
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:45,910
He was a community
organizer and an academic.

1690
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:49,120
I don't want that guy running
running shit, you know? And if,

1691
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:54,040
and if Romney wasn't so crazy
with his religion and stuff, I,

1692
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:56,560
I would be like, well, he was
kind of a stud businessman,

1693
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,360
but I don't even know what he stands for.

1694
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:03,160
He hadn't come clean with the tax returns.
He's a fucking Mormon. He's a Mormon.

1695
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:06,610
He's an old creep. He's a creep.
His wife was made out of plastic.

1696
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:09,340
His whole family lives in the dark.
They're crazy

1697
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:14,200
and he's just going to do whatever the
fuck they tell them. I always tell people,

1698
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:15,730
if you want to know about Mitt Romney,

1699
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:19,120
there's a video online where he gets
confronted by a guy in a wheelchair who

1700
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:22,980
needs medical marijuana and Mitt Romney
shrugs this guy off like he does. Lisa,

1701
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:23,913
of course,

1702
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:27,770
I don't believe in medical marijuana and
he just gets away from the Jesus' robe.

1703
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:30,010
But I will say that in,
in Massachusetts,

1704
01:34:30,011 --> 01:34:33,610
the guy actually spent a lot of time on
the other side of the aisle and got a

1705
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:38,530
lot of shit done, including universal
healthcare and balancing the budget.

1706
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:41,740
You can't take that away from him. And
by the way he was a stud. But you know,

1707
01:34:41,741 --> 01:34:45,210
Bain capital good and maybe create
a lot of jobs. I don't think that,

1708
01:34:45,211 --> 01:34:46,750
but I don't want to let the federal level,

1709
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:49,480
I don't think you get them that kind of,
maybe not.

1710
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:52,600
I think you can really be a real governor.

1711
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:56,620
I don't think he can be a real president.
Uh, I think when it gets to that level,

1712
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,010
when it comes to,
especially with things

1713
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,350
like war government,

1714
01:34:59,351 --> 01:35:02,360
some have to do state governments
don't have to worry about war.

1715
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:05,540
When you get to a federal level and
you're dealing with multibillion dollar

1716
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:09,690
contracts and dealing with, you know, the
pullout of the truck from Afghanistan.

1717
01:35:09,691 --> 01:35:13,590
When I was telling you I talked to this,
my buddy who's a real CIA guy and,

1718
01:35:13,591 --> 01:35:16,730
and I had him do my podcasts and I called
him Mr Pink cause he just was like,

1719
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:21,110
you know, it was really weird. He's so
smart and he's, he's really the real deal.

1720
01:35:21,111 --> 01:35:23,780
And I said, what do you get? Gimme
gimme some stuff about the Iraq war.

1721
01:35:23,781 --> 01:35:26,130
And then we went in there because
of this and that. And he goes, man,

1722
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:29,390
he was like this. He was
like, yeah, I mean I guess you
could say that, but really,

1723
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:30,530
you know what I think it
is. I go, what? He goes,

1724
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:34,520
I think it's just a bunch of interests
that get together and it snowballs.

1725
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:35,121
And before,

1726
01:35:35,121 --> 01:35:38,540
you know what a lot of people are gonna
make a lot of money on this notion and a

1727
01:35:38,541 --> 01:35:41,720
lot of people get an idea and somebody
picks up on it and they just assume it's

1728
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:43,340
true.
And before you know it,

1729
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:47,150
you got this fucking machine that
ain't going to stop for anybody.

1730
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,800
And he was really kind of matter of
fact about it. And I was like, Geez,

1731
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:54,890
this is an inside guy who
spent seven years there and
here he is telling me this.

1732
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:56,830
He goes, he goes, listen
dude. He goes, it,

1733
01:35:56,950 --> 01:36:01,950
they spent $100,000 importing sand in so
that they could play volleyball in the

1734
01:36:03,381 --> 01:36:07,130
desert. You're like, Oh yeah,
we talked about this once
before. How much corruption,

1735
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,200
how much waste there is.
And you know,

1736
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:12,720
we've all heard of the $500 hammers and
all the stupid shit that you know were,

1737
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:16,440
it was unknown accountability,
man. No accountability.
What's government? You know,

1738
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:20,390
the idea that it's all tax money.
And what I saw with the banking industry,

1739
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:20,931
I mean,

1740
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:23,840
investment banks used to have to gamble
with their own money and then they

1741
01:36:23,841 --> 01:36:27,650
became public and all of a sudden
they're using your money to experiment.

1742
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,550
And you had these cowboys who were like,
let's fucking leverage it 40 times.

1743
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:34,160
I'm being simplistic. But that's
kind of what happened. Well,

1744
01:36:34,161 --> 01:36:36,770
Benny was talking the mathematician who,
uh,

1745
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:41,830
the NSA guy was talking about other things
that the NSA had funded to try to do

1746
01:36:41,991 --> 01:36:46,220
the same thing. That didn't work,
that they spent billions of dollars,

1747
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:50,180
billions of dollars, dollars of your
dollars, by the way that they don't.

1748
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:53,450
That's the craziest thing about your
taxes. You pay whatever you pay.

1749
01:36:53,451 --> 01:36:57,020
20% of [inaudible] goes.
You don't even fucking get,

1750
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:02,090
you can't even request it. You can't say,
hey, I would like to know, you know what?

1751
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:05,540
How much of my money you're spending?
Is there a website I could go to?

1752
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:09,110
Like maybe then I'll send it to you, but
you could go, oh, hey mister Callan. Yeah.

1753
01:37:09,111 --> 01:37:13,650
Well you paid $70,000 in taxes last
year and your money went to [inaudible],

1754
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:18,050
you know? No, yeah, go fuck yourself.
They don't even make it up for you.

1755
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:21,650
There's like, there's it. Just take it
youtube again. Besides it's Beeni guy,

1756
01:37:21,651 --> 01:37:23,210
also youtube,
Milton Friedman,

1757
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:26,180
who wouldn't want to know about prize
for economics and just just youtube and

1758
01:37:26,181 --> 01:37:28,040
listen to his debates.
Just listen to those debates.

1759
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:31,910
It's really easy to follow and all. He
talks about his personal liberty. They go,

1760
01:37:31,911 --> 01:37:35,360
you're a conservative, cause I don't like
that word. I'm, I'm, I believe in liberty.

1761
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:38,480
So whatever I am, I'm very
liberal. It's weird when you,

1762
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:43,530
when you go conservative
or liberal because people
like to attach themselves to

1763
01:37:43,551 --> 01:37:46,800
ideologies and they will find a,

1764
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:49,570
like an area where they can operate in.

1765
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:51,100
They feel more comfortable
being a liberal.

1766
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:53,960
Then you feel more comfortable with
being a conservative and they just the,

1767
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,720
they're there.
They don't have no openmindedness

1768
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:59,580
and it just seems they're
on a team. Exactly, exactly.

1769
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:03,510
They just lock on to team Mac.
I'm on team Pc.

1770
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:07,260
I like android phones. I'm a windows
man. Marcel, we've got a windows phone.

1771
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:08,910
Whereas whereas if you talk about liberty,

1772
01:38:08,911 --> 01:38:12,510
you're talking about a philosophy
and an idea that, that, that that's,

1773
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:13,950
that's what I like to talk about.

1774
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:18,300
I like having discussions based on the
ideas and philosophies, the underpinnings.

1775
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:22,440
Not, not, don't, don't label me
Republican, Democrat, even a libertarian.

1776
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:24,750
I want to talk about ideas and,
and,

1777
01:38:24,751 --> 01:38:28,880
and develop a philosophy that's
that fucking shit works there.

1778
01:38:28,881 --> 01:38:32,520
Can the conservative Liberal Shit works?
Look in works by the way,

1779
01:38:32,521 --> 01:38:35,750
with liberals just as bad.
It's what conservatives are.

1780
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,220
Nothing drives me fucking nutty.

1781
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:43,340
More than hypocritical liberals who talk
about Republicans being prejudice and

1782
01:38:43,441 --> 01:38:46,080
then they're completely prejudice.
He lost his mind.

1783
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:50,340
Anybody who has any ideas
remotely different from there.

1784
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:55,530
It's so weird.
That whole like artificial sensitivity.

1785
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,180
You know like you, you've, you've,

1786
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:01,380
you've adopted what is like a chic style,

1787
01:39:01,381 --> 01:39:04,800
a cool style of thinking.
You know, this is the,

1788
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,770
this is aggressive style people.
We also,

1789
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,900
my father was talking
about tyranny of language.

1790
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:12,950
There's a tyranny of language
in this country where,

1791
01:39:12,951 --> 01:39:17,640
where one side will garner a sort of
a patent on. We are the progressive's.

1792
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:19,110
We are, well, I haven't,

1793
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:22,830
I believe I happen to believe we should
legalize gay marriage and drugs and a

1794
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:24,480
lot of other things.
That makes me pretty progressive,

1795
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:28,050
but at the same time I want a small
government so that I can be considered a

1796
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:30,180
conservative as well because I want,
I don't want,

1797
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:32,360
I don't want all these
vested interests in my flat,

1798
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:34,270
but that's the question is how do you,

1799
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:38,580
and if I start talking about,
if I start,

1800
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,630
if I start talking about small government
people go, you're a republican. Well, no,

1801
01:39:42,631 --> 01:39:45,570
I'm not actually because I'm pro choice
and you know a lot of other things,

1802
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,440
so don't call me and I'm not a Christian,
so let's relax with this stuff.

1803
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:50,580
You know?
So,

1804
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:55,070
so there is a tyranny of language in this
country and and there always has been

1805
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:58,320
in political, in political
culture. You, you,

1806
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:02,100
you did a really good book called don't
think of an elephant that I ever tell

1807
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:05,550
you about this book. No, it's written
by David Frum who talks about,

1808
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:09,300
I think his name is David Fromm. Forgive
me if it's not, but he talks about how,

1809
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:14,730
how effective it is when you,
when you say this is the Patriot Act,

1810
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:19,410
how do you vote against,
against the Patriot Act for example,

1811
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:21,000
you're not going to vote him.
Get Dot.

1812
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:22,920
You're not a patriot if you
vote against the Patriot Act,

1813
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:25,200
and there are a lot of
things you can do as a,

1814
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:30,260
as a political force to
hijack your position by making
it very inconvenient and

1815
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:37,530
sound bad. When you vote against,
you can't vote against the page.

1816
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,900
How do you change it, Joe? How
do you change it? I don't know,

1817
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,570
I'm still trying to figure it out.
Uh,

1818
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,880
the only thing that I can think is you
got to change young people and you've got

1819
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:47,190
to have the people that are going into it.
Like this guy that we had,

1820
01:40:47,191 --> 01:40:51,040
David Seaman who was on a Monday, June
his twenties, 26 years old. Wow, that's,

1821
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:54,160
that's the noise. I'm not
congress, the kind of guy and very

1822
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,040
articulate, very bright. That's
the kind of guys you need.

1823
01:40:57,041 --> 01:41:02,041
You need young kids that are coming out
of college and that they understand the

1824
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:06,310
way the world works a million times
better than some fucking dummy who grew up

1825
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:08,110
in the land of books and crayons.
Okay.

1826
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:11,870
Amos Oz is a famous Israeli
writer was saying, um,

1827
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:13,330
he said the way you will beat,

1828
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:16,240
they were talking about Hamas and I'm as
a terrorist organization and they said,

1829
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,140
he said,
well I,

1830
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:20,500
he had a problem with Israel going in
and assassinating Hamas leaders and he

1831
01:41:20,501 --> 01:41:24,700
said the way you, you, you
beat Hamas is not with guns.

1832
01:41:24,701 --> 01:41:27,640
Cause Hamas is an idea. And they
said, what are we doing? He said,

1833
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:31,600
the way you beat a bad idea like
Hamas is with a better idea,

1834
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:33,640
and that's a really powerful statement.

1835
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,920
It is power come up and
remember that this country,

1836
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:40,590
this country is an idea.
This eye is an ideal. And,

1837
01:41:40,591 --> 01:41:43,870
and in a lot of ways those men in those
founding fathers solve the political

1838
01:41:43,871 --> 01:41:44,650
problem.

1839
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:48,310
The constitution is an amazing thing and
it's being jacked less than a reject,

1840
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:50,800
but remember that it's a very powerful
idea and keep fighting for it.

1841
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:55,870
Obama has done more to
harm the constitution than
any president before him.

1842
01:41:56,150 --> 01:42:00,530
What he's done by pass the National
Defense Authorization Act is nothing short

1843
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:05,560
of what you should have considered as
treasonous w w w with someone in the past

1844
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:09,960
we consider as treasonous the ability
to detain people with no warrant to the

1845
01:42:09,961 --> 01:42:12,590
ability to hold them with
no recourse whatsoever.

1846
01:42:12,591 --> 01:42:13,880
They don't have the right to a trial.

1847
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:16,160
They don't have anything that we're
supposed to be standing for it.

1848
01:42:16,161 --> 01:42:20,960
America for foreign
enemies. Oh No, no, no, no,

1849
01:42:20,961 --> 01:42:22,150
no,
no.

1850
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:26,540
It's for anyone that they deem
to be an enemy of the state. Wow.

1851
01:42:26,990 --> 01:42:31,070
National.
We were allowed to use that.

1852
01:42:31,071 --> 01:42:36,071
He has now rather allowed to
use the military to quell any,

1853
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:40,960
did any dissent inside our brochure?
Yes.

1854
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:44,260
Posse comitatus done. He's
trying to get through it. Oh,

1855
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:49,010
it's past national defense
authorization act. Everybody passed it.

1856
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:52,370
Obama said he was going to veto. It
didn't be taught. No one vetoed it.

1857
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:55,820
No one pass it. I don't think
they get a say. I really don't.

1858
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:59,840
I think when you've got a company like
Halliburton and then has fucking billions

1859
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,470
of dollars and they're,

1860
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:04,100
they're profiting in in mad
crazy ways from his fucking war.

1861
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:06,980
I don't think anybody gets a say.

1862
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:11,510
I think that influence the influence of
that money is so strong and so sharp.

1863
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,410
They can't avoid it. I hope you're
wrong. I'm not wrong. I'm not wrong.

1864
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:18,450
You may not be wrong and and so in
that case it's hard not to be sent.

1865
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:21,370
How do you not know about this? We
talked about this before. I mean reading,

1866
01:43:21,371 --> 01:43:24,640
reading, reading this, this movie.
Just talking about reading this book.

1867
01:43:24,641 --> 01:43:25,441
I just keep talking to you.

1868
01:43:25,441 --> 01:43:28,270
Call that called the China
study is a classic example.

1869
01:43:28,271 --> 01:43:31,030
This guy does such an amazing job
of off Tang, what you're saying,

1870
01:43:31,090 --> 01:43:35,180
how we are no longer all of a
sudden your kid at school is,

1871
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:39,940
is being fed all different kinds of food
that is not only making them sick but

1872
01:43:39,941 --> 01:43:40,774
fat.

1873
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,350
How did you, but listen man, you can
give your kid food. Okay, that's,

1874
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:46,750
that's a terrible thing and everything.
When your kids phone to school,

1875
01:43:46,751 --> 01:43:49,650
you can bring a lunch. That's not as
bad as what the fuck is happening.

1876
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:54,070
The ability to have people
arrested with no recourse, man.

1877
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:59,110
We are literally literally in a Soviet,

1878
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:04,340
did I talk to you about this a while ago?
Man, National Defense Authorization Act.

1879
01:44:04,341 --> 01:44:07,190
It's a terrifying thing that was passed.
Terrifying.

1880
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,220
All this shit that's going
on with wikileaks where
they're trying to pull this

1881
01:44:10,221 --> 01:44:12,840
guy out of the Ecuadorian
embassy in London. They're,

1882
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:16,610
they're letting everybody know that
the rules are fake. Like, well,

1883
01:44:16,611 --> 01:44:19,790
that rule the world. He's actually
wanting for sexual assault and Sweden.

1884
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:21,560
Sweden's just wanted for sexual assault.

1885
01:44:21,561 --> 01:44:26,561
Don't say that he's wanted for sexual
incident cries sex surprise sex is a

1886
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,210
bitch. Shut it off. You can't turn
on a junkie kind of look up. No,

1887
01:44:32,211 --> 01:44:35,100
I was trying to look at that act.
Oh,

1888
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:39,420
surprise sex is what he's wanted for. What
do you mean surprise sex? What's that?

1889
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:42,170
Nearly had sex with a chick with a
condom on and they were sleeping in bed

1890
01:44:42,171 --> 01:44:45,920
together and with no condom he slipped
it in and there's photos of her hanging

1891
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:48,710
out with him two days later,
like all palling around.

1892
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:51,050
Look what he did was kind of creepy,
but guess what?

1893
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:53,420
You're not supposed to sleep naked with
a guy if you don't want him to stick.

1894
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:57,440
It was or, and that's just what dudes
do were gross rose, creepy animals.

1895
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:01,010
Of course he's wanting to dive well,
it's not even that.

1896
01:45:01,011 --> 01:45:03,050
I don't know how many times back when
I'm back in the day, I'd be like, well,

1897
01:45:03,051 --> 01:45:07,550
I don't have any diseases. And
what about not just the tip,

1898
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:11,550
all the dies? Well that's what he
did. He's a scumbag sex gambler,

1899
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:16,240
but a lot of guys are, there's a video
of him dancing. Scott, myself. Yeah, guy.

1900
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:19,220
Just regular guy is a video
of him dancing by himself.

1901
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:23,090
It's just him on the dance floor getting
his groove on and it's so dorky and

1902
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:27,920
creepy. You Watch and it's just like, oh
Jeez, look at this guy. He's so weird.

1903
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:32,650
He's American, isn't the
American, how did he,

1904
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:35,900
Swedish massage.
Yeah.

1905
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:38,720
I don't think it's a man or a
fucking agent of this information.

1906
01:45:38,721 --> 01:45:42,110
You work for Fox and I'm just saying,
I think, I don't know. Well it's,

1907
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:45,650
I want to see positive.
He's debates.

1908
01:45:45,651 --> 01:45:50,290
John O'reilly, Bill O'reilly,
and he does such a great job.

1909
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:54,920
He fucking made fun of a Fox.
I'm such a good way though.

1910
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:59,270
He just exposed and I read to a
bill O'Reilly. Oh he's Australian.

1911
01:45:59,271 --> 01:46:03,350
That's a stress. I knew he had something
going on. I might as well be American.

1912
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:09,150
I was truly in Australia. You
do? Yeah. When went to Sydney.

1913
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:12,700
They're fucking, they
have the, Australia is a,

1914
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:17,450
they're like a little more relaxed than
us. A little more down to party little,

1915
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:20,450
you know, this is fun people and they're
just different. I like Australia.

1916
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,700
I've actually never met an
Australian who is a deck.

1917
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:26,870
I had two friends that are really
famous in Australia and not famous here.

1918
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:31,400
Orange Barker who's like Kinda does
well here. Eddie, if Eddie F yeah,

1919
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,170
and both of them are fucking year,

1920
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:37,520
especially orange are just
gigantic in Australia. Yeah man.

1921
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:39,650
He's like fucking Justin
Bieber over there.

1922
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:44,150
I can't walk down the street in Australia.
Yeah, and they love him in Australia,

1923
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:46,560
but in America it's like
barely hanging on. You know,

1924
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:49,980
he comes over here and just fucking half
fold crowds and doesn't make any sense.

1925
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,510
He goes over there, he fills out
auditoriums every night. Really? Yeah.

1926
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:57,000
He's sold out some crazy shit like
18 nights in a row in a theater there

1927
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:03,510
at least it might be more than a
million, by the way. 18 nights Australia,

1928
01:47:03,511 --> 01:47:04,170
I'm coming,

1929
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:06,600
it's like two months and offered a
couple of times and it's just like,

1930
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:09,240
I'm always like, we're going to fly first
class. Well we don't have in the budget.

1931
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:12,350
I'm like, fuck you. That budget,

1932
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:15,180
that's a $25,000 fucking
ticket in first class.

1933
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:18,990
That's why they put you on one of those
83 eighties and you get like a little

1934
01:47:18,991 --> 01:47:21,330
apartment.
That's what FirstClass says.

1935
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,740
But if you don't do that then you're stuck
in a cramped spot for 16 hours and it

1936
01:47:25,741 --> 01:47:27,660
sucks.
Business class business,

1937
01:47:27,661 --> 01:47:32,010
cause I flew first class to Thailand and
I was doing a hangover too and that was,

1938
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:36,720
that was that I got off the plane, I was
a year older and I was so fucking long.

1939
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:39,330
It took me and I was sitting in first
class and it was like luxurious and

1940
01:47:39,331 --> 01:47:42,150
everything else. I had all tie
Taiwanese airline or whatever it was.

1941
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:47,320
It was unbelievable, but you know what?
Too long and you feel like shit for,

1942
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:48,871
you know,

1943
01:47:48,871 --> 01:47:52,080
they say that the radiation from those
planes when you're flying and high

1944
01:47:52,081 --> 01:47:52,914
altitude,

1945
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:55,770
the radiation is way worse than the
radiation you're getting when you're going

1946
01:47:55,771 --> 01:47:58,420
through the metal detector.
Air is also shitty too.

1947
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:03,060
Shit air and you've got to
drink a lot of water. I do that.

1948
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:08,040
A lot of the hangover feeling the people
get dehydration, drink a lot of water,

1949
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:11,670
eat something very nutritious.
Alpha brain helps a lot.

1950
01:48:11,671 --> 01:48:13,850
It's fantastic for jetlag.
Yeah.

1951
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:18,060
Fantastic for jet lag and fantastic for
when you don't get enough sleep because

1952
01:48:18,061 --> 01:48:18,720
it's one of the,

1953
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:23,720
one of the main reasons that you have
that sort of like a foggy misfiring sort

1954
01:48:25,201 --> 01:48:28,530
of a brain when you're hung
over or when you're jet lagged.

1955
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:32,970
So your neurotransmission, Mike
Young said he goes, you and Rogan,

1956
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,350
I've been with you guys on the road.

1957
01:48:34,351 --> 01:48:38,190
You guys don't need any sleep on the
how you doing? I was like, I need sleep,

1958
01:48:38,191 --> 01:48:41,030
but if I'm having a good time I can go.
I can go.

1959
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:44,940
Cause I was in Afghanistan and I, I
didn't sleep for probably a week, like,

1960
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,130
like just very little.
I was still working out.

1961
01:48:47,131 --> 01:48:50,070
I was just so pumped and
afraid at the same time.

1962
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:53,700
So my adrenaline was just
literally pumping for a week,

1963
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:56,110
so I didn't even need any say I'd wake
up two hours, I'd be like, all right,

1964
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:00,990
we got sold out shows and you're going
to do a big giant fucking crowd's waiting

1965
01:49:00,991 --> 01:49:05,460
to see you. You get fired up, man. I don't
care if you're tired and you have to,

1966
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:07,830
I felt sick with a fever.

1967
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:12,130
I got on stage an hour and a half later
I come off and I'm like, I'm 100% right.

1968
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,080
You feel better. Yeah. It's a,

1969
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:17,100
no one is ever going to understand that
feeling unless they've actually done it.

1970
01:49:17,101 --> 01:49:21,090
But there's a giant responsibility that
you have after a while when people are

1971
01:49:21,091 --> 01:49:22,230
coming to see you.

1972
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:24,930
You remember when you would go to
a comedy club and it was just like,

1973
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:26,460
you happen to be headlining,

1974
01:49:26,461 --> 01:49:29,940
but nobody knew who the fuck you and I
went out on that stage in front of your

1975
01:49:29,941 --> 01:49:32,910
fans in Denver.
It was so loud at her.

1976
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:36,450
My face feel that I could feel
the sound waves on my face.

1977
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:41,100
That was 2000 ravenous fans,
ravenous fans.

1978
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:44,130
And the minute I walked out there,
they thought it was Joe Rogan.

1979
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:47,550
They were on their feet,
literally like, like

1980
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:52,540
I was like, oh, okay. This is a, this
is a whole different level. Yeah.

1981
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:54,960
We tell people what we're
talking about. We, uh, we,

1982
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:57,280
we pumped the crowd and Brian went on,

1983
01:49:57,281 --> 01:50:00,400
we said Lazy and Joey Diaz brought me up,

1984
01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:04,540
but Brian went on stage
instead. So it was, it was, uh,

1985
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:08,350
I have recorded it actually. Yeah.
It was really funny though. It was a,

1986
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:11,350
it was hilarious because it like,
they went on for a little while,

1987
01:50:11,351 --> 01:50:13,930
but then they were like, Hey, wait,
what the fuck is going on here?

1988
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:17,450
Hold on, let me see if
I go find it. You guys,

1989
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:22,730
don't forget about the 10 minute podcast.
We're number 15. You're number 15 now.

1990
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,930
Yeah.
10 minute podcasts number.

1991
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:27,740
I think [inaudible] 15 and [inaudible]
last time I checked I was number 14. Oh,

1992
01:50:27,741 --> 01:50:30,440
you said that was mine. That was mine
yesterday. So it's pretty exciting.

1993
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:35,380
Are you excited? I love it.
Yeah. This is you ready?

1994
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,900
Brian's going to go out there.
Ask me.

1995
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:41,770
You see how long it takes for
the realize to not me? Yeah.

1996
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:44,070
Just come walking out

1997
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,530
and this is Joey d is about to bring me on

1998
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:09,230
what's going on? Gonna fucking
Frank's since what? I said,

1999
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:13,850
they still think I'm you crazy or you
mean only people in the front row where

2000
01:51:13,851 --> 01:51:16,550
I'm like, what the fuck's
going on? They were like,

2001
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:21,140
we lose a lot of weight. Does
Joe have rickets? There's still,

2002
01:51:21,141 --> 01:51:24,860
see he's still on stage.
And now I got onstage and then I was like,

2003
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:30,743
okay.

2004
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:35,910
Right. So your fans are great too.
They were literally all they, they all,

2005
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:38,730
I couldn't get out of the foyer. You
hadn't seen it before. And I told her,

2006
01:51:38,731 --> 01:51:42,330
I remember telling you, I'm
like, wait till joy get Joey
Diaz goes on stage. I go,

2007
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:44,260
you're going to see something
that you've never seen before.

2008
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:48,640
And I remember the look on your
face. You were like, Holy Shit,

2009
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:52,240
this is crazy. It's, it's a, it's on. Uh,

2010
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:54,940
it's on a completely different level
when you see, did you ever think,

2011
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:58,280
why do you think you're
a podcast is so insanely,

2012
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:03,670
I dunno, um, people are connecting
with it. What are they connected with?

2013
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:08,270
I am being as honest as
humanly possible and uh,

2014
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:12,520
I have, uh, I got a lot of
interests. I'm fascinated by things.

2015
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:17,580
And I think people get to be fascinated
and along with me on this podcast and

2016
01:52:18,251 --> 01:52:21,700
they know that if I'm telling you
something, whether I'm right or wrong,

2017
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:25,390
it's because I truly honestly believe
it. Cause I looked at it, I studied it.

2018
01:52:25,391 --> 01:52:28,780
Even if it doesn't make any sense, like,
yeah, like big foot, like big foot talk,

2019
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:32,810
I'm, I'm not willing to say the big
foot's not real. Yeah. You know,

2020
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:35,710
and that's for a lot of people, like as
soon as you start saying shit like that,

2021
01:52:35,711 --> 01:52:37,750
you become an idiot.
You know, students, you,

2022
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:39,820
as soon as you start saying things like,
you know,

2023
01:52:39,821 --> 01:52:43,990
you think maybe there
might be a intelligent life
that's visited this planet

2024
01:52:43,991 --> 01:52:46,070
thousands of years ago and made people

2025
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:49,910
out of monkeys, like, get the fuck Outta
here. Yeah. I don't know. You don't know.

2026
01:52:49,911 --> 01:52:51,290
You're really,
don't just fact it.

2027
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:55,600
People exist alone is
bizarre enough to me to,

2028
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:59,750
to leave open a billion different
possibilities for how life is seated

2029
01:52:59,751 --> 01:53:01,740
throughout the universe,
including life on.

2030
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:06,500
But I'm not afraid of looking
like a retard, you know? I'm just,

2031
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:08,260
I think it's good. I think, yeah,

2032
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:11,180
I think that's one of the reasons that
I also think that I'm really impressed

2033
01:53:11,181 --> 01:53:14,960
with. I think a lot of people, young man
especially want to learn something. Well,

2034
01:53:14,961 --> 01:53:17,960
a lot of young men are demonized and
we've got a real parking problem in this

2035
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:19,910
country where we're
suppressing masculinity.

2036
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:23,180
We're not accepting the fact
that men like manly shit.

2037
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:26,360
We hundred percent like VHS.
We like steaks.

2038
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:30,740
We'd like Leonard Skinner was
like hunting and fishing and MMA.

2039
01:53:30,830 --> 01:53:35,830
And guess what you being prejudice
about that is just as bad as a man being

2040
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:39,440
sexist.
It's just as bad as a person being racist.

2041
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,720
It's you're judging and making people,
you know,

2042
01:53:41,721 --> 01:53:46,130
many times I've felt bad for what I
look like or who I am or what I like.

2043
01:53:46,131 --> 01:53:49,850
When I was a young man,
especially women, intellectuals,

2044
01:53:49,851 --> 01:53:53,210
always different people would like look
down on you as if there was something

2045
01:53:53,211 --> 01:53:54,110
wrong with you,

2046
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:57,950
that you legitimately enjoyed what
you enjoy without hurting anybody.

2047
01:53:57,951 --> 01:54:00,650
I always felt inappropriate and it's still
a lot of circles while come and I go,

2048
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:05,700
man, I think in such a different way than
these fucking people. And I, I dunno.

2049
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:07,670
It's just, I always, you
feel like you're like,

2050
01:54:07,671 --> 01:54:10,020
you feel like you're doing something wrong
when you're younger you're like, yeah,

2051
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:12,200
I just like rolling around in
a matter. I like, you know,

2052
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:14,540
well we're not represented.
We're not represented because men,

2053
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:15,680
when they reach a certain point in time,

2054
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:18,680
they have to put on a fucking tie and
some stupid shoes would slippery bottoms

2055
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:21,560
and go to some job. That sucks.
That's the majority of men.

2056
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:24,140
And so they're not really represented.
You know,

2057
01:54:24,141 --> 01:54:28,280
when a guy gets buck wild and lives
like Mike Tyson, he's not celebrated.

2058
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:30,350
Oh that's good.
He's got a crash.

2059
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:33,110
Well it's interesting because people
want to send to you right away cause I

2060
01:54:33,111 --> 01:54:33,944
think you're a threat.

2061
01:54:34,210 --> 01:54:36,860
I that that's almost like there was a
psychiatrist talking about male female

2062
01:54:36,861 --> 01:54:39,740
dynamics a lot of times and a lot of
women will be really attracted to an Alpha

2063
01:54:39,741 --> 01:54:42,590
male. And then what
happens is, and it's very,

2064
01:54:42,591 --> 01:54:46,370
very common and it's a big problem in
a relationship. What they'll do is,

2065
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:49,040
and this guy's a couple's counselor who
works with a lot of different couples,

2066
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:52,340
say what they'll do is women will then
be afraid that that aggression is going

2067
01:54:52,341 --> 01:54:54,890
to be turned on them and their
children. So they'll, they'll,

2068
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:58,610
they'll take it out of the man when they
finally take it out of the man of man.

2069
01:54:58,610 --> 01:54:59,510
Cause I was like,
fuck this.

2070
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:01,160
I don't want to deal with all of
these things are not attracted to him.

2071
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:03,710
And I talked to him anymore.
Yeah, it's a, it's a grand game.

2072
01:55:03,711 --> 01:55:07,740
So the point is don't lose sight of who
you are and what you're trying to do.

2073
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:08,000
There's,

2074
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,110
there's a great deal to learn and
accomplish by embracing your masculinity.

2075
01:55:12,230 --> 01:55:16,460
You learn just as much trying to get
your black belt in Jujitsu as you do.

2076
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:19,730
Getting a phd in,
in certain ways about yourself.

2077
01:55:19,731 --> 01:55:23,760
I'm talking about you learn
more, you learn more. Listen,

2078
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:25,430
it's all relative.

2079
01:55:25,431 --> 01:55:29,990
But what's important in this
life is embrace what you enjoy.

2080
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:32,690
And most men are not taught that.

2081
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:37,720
Most are most men or they're made to feel
terrible about liking certain things.

2082
01:55:38,381 --> 01:55:40,790
And it's taught by the way,
it's just as masculine and play the flute.

2083
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:43,820
If you play it really
well and no, but, but

2084
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,510
I mean, you know, he's not
there. There are different,

2085
01:55:45,511 --> 01:55:47,820
there are different forms of and
expressions of masculinity. It's not,

2086
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:51,390
doesn't even have to be hitting the bag
and shit, you know? Well, I just think he,

2087
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,070
not even masculinity,
that's not even the word.

2088
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:57,210
It's really honesty because I get a
lot of positive messages from women.

2089
01:55:57,211 --> 01:56:00,030
It's like you're allowed to be yourself.
Women should be in the group.

2090
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:03,330
Like my wife's in all kinds of girly shit.
I don't even try to understand it.

2091
01:56:03,331 --> 01:56:07,600
I don't understand. I don't pretend, but
I don't judge her. I mean, she's well,

2092
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:09,420
but she's,
she genuinely likes it.

2093
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:13,230
There's people who genuinely like
country music, they genuinely like it.

2094
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:16,650
They love it, they want to hear it.
There's nothing wrong with that man.

2095
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:20,430
And the problem with a lot of people
and a lot of liberals especially,

2096
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:25,760
is that they will mock what you love
if you don't like what they like.

2097
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:30,320
They will try to marginalize your
opinion, you know? And you know,

2098
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:35,370
they'll talk about calling you hyper
masculine that that's really interesting

2099
01:56:35,371 --> 01:56:38,700
why they marginalize your opinion and
they marginalize you and they do it

2100
01:56:38,701 --> 01:56:41,000
through criticism. And sometimes
it can be effective criticism, big,

2101
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:45,190
very kind of glossy criticism where
they're using big words and, and they're,

2102
01:56:45,210 --> 01:56:47,970
they're comparing you to something and
you don't really have necessarily the

2103
01:56:47,971 --> 01:56:51,750
ammunition to fight back because
you're not as good with language.

2104
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:55,230
And all of a sudden you feel kind of
without ammo might not even be that.

2105
01:56:55,231 --> 01:56:57,570
It might be that you haven't
even thought about it.

2106
01:56:57,660 --> 01:57:02,190
And they've been working on this argument
against who you are as a human being

2107
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:05,850
or most of their life because you are
the type of person who's always rejected

2108
01:57:05,851 --> 01:57:08,730
them. You're the type of
person that didn't think they
were sexually attractive.

2109
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:11,150
So it made them feel bad.
So now they've decided that these hype,

2110
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:15,960
hyper masculine men who are not attracted
to me or assholes ruining this earth.

2111
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:16,690
Meanwhile,

2112
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:21,690
if that guy thought you were sexy and
you know he liked to fuck you and you

2113
01:57:22,051 --> 01:57:26,220
would like to fuck him and you were into
like this hyper masculine guy sticking

2114
01:57:26,221 --> 01:57:29,060
his big cock inside of you, then it
went out, you'd have a different thing.

2115
01:57:29,061 --> 01:57:32,550
It's like, well we think differently,
but as long as you respect my space,

2116
01:57:32,551 --> 01:57:35,280
I'll suck his cock. But no,
he doesn't want to fuck you.

2117
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:40,370
So he's an enemy because he gives to
you a bad feeling of feeling of you not

2118
01:57:41,011 --> 01:57:44,160
being attractive,
a feeling of you being rejected.

2119
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:48,120
It's the same thing with ugly men who
become woman haters their whole life.

2120
01:57:48,121 --> 01:57:50,640
They've been rejected by women
over and over and over again.

2121
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:54,810
So they develop this, fuck these
bitches, fuck these hoes. They have this,

2122
01:57:54,811 --> 01:57:58,860
this attitude towards women
fucking lesbian, that fucking that.

2123
01:57:58,861 --> 01:58:03,730
That attitude is not much different
than the really homely, ultra, you know,

2124
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:07,470
aggressive feminist woman who wants to
attack everything that men are into.

2125
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:11,100
Hypermasculine rape supporters,
rape culture.

2126
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:13,200
It's really a lot of the same thing.

2127
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:18,180
It's finding someone who's different than
you and conveniently putting them in a

2128
01:58:18,181 --> 01:58:21,240
box. So that anything that they
enjoy, whether you enjoy it or not,

2129
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:25,120
anything that they enjoy becomes
fodder and anything that they enjoy,

2130
01:58:25,121 --> 01:58:27,480
it becomes something that does,
that you can use to dismiss.

2131
01:58:27,490 --> 01:58:31,860
That kind of criticism becomes habitual
and it makes it impossible to actually

2132
01:58:31,861 --> 01:58:33,210
achieve anything in yourself.
When you,

2133
01:58:33,211 --> 01:58:35,910
when you walk around and like such a
good critic and you're a good critic,

2134
01:58:35,911 --> 01:58:36,411
that same could,

2135
01:58:36,411 --> 01:58:39,720
it comes back to criticize you when
you really try try to do something,

2136
01:58:39,721 --> 01:58:42,310
but you have to be able to look
at yourself and your own nonsense

2137
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:44,950
and you also have to be able to look at
how other people are going to view your

2138
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:45,784
own nonsense.

2139
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:50,140
And just because you don't like
something doesn't mean something is bad,

2140
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:53,170
you know,
it just means it's not for you and do,

2141
01:58:53,171 --> 01:58:56,860
you can't marginalize someone based on
what they like and what they don't like.

2142
01:58:56,890 --> 01:59:00,790
There's some brilliant people that like
fucking pop music, they are brilliant,

2143
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:04,630
but they like to get in their car and
listen as stupid ass fucking songs and

2144
01:59:04,631 --> 01:59:08,950
sing along. It's fun for them and it
doesn't make them less of a human.

2145
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:09,843
That's right.

2146
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:13,510
We've got a real fucking problem in this
country of looking for fault in other

2147
01:59:13,511 --> 01:59:18,400
folks instead of first doing our own
goddamn personal inventory first,

2148
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,170
get that shit out of the way.
First,

2149
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,770
concentrate on all your own issues
because a lot of times the issues that you

2150
01:59:23,771 --> 01:59:28,240
have and other people really are a
reflection of how you view yourself when

2151
01:59:28,241 --> 01:59:30,070
you're around them.
Let me piggy back what you just said.

2152
01:59:30,071 --> 01:59:32,070
Cause a lot of times if somebody said,
um,

2153
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:34,770
we live in a culture doesn't make
you feel good about yourself and,

2154
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:39,100
and one of the things that um, that this
culture also does advertising things,

2155
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:39,701
whatever it might be,

2156
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:43,000
but we live in a culture that at that
gets you to think that there's something

2157
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:44,140
you have to add,

2158
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:48,010
you have to add to yourself when in fact
it's probably something you'd have to

2159
01:59:48,011 --> 01:59:50,320
delete. You have to take something
away from yourself that doesn't,

2160
01:59:50,321 --> 01:59:52,990
isn't really you and just get
back to who you really are.

2161
01:59:52,991 --> 01:59:55,570
It's a kind of a neat way of looking
at kind of development and growth.

2162
01:59:56,070 --> 01:59:59,890
I a lot of times I really think that
stand up and all the things I do are just

2163
01:59:59,891 --> 02:00:03,880
bringing me, bringing me back to
who I've always been in a way.

2164
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:08,380
Like it's a process of sort
of, um, uh, distilling. Like I,

2165
02:00:08,390 --> 02:00:11,450
what I love about writing and
stand up is that as I do it,

2166
02:00:11,451 --> 02:00:14,200
I started to realize in some ways I've
always been writing about the same thing

2167
02:00:14,201 --> 02:00:15,190
over and over again.

2168
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:19,870
But in a way I'm
distilling who I really am.

2169
02:00:19,871 --> 02:00:24,580
I'm getting to the core essence of
who I really am. So now what I do,

2170
02:00:24,581 --> 02:00:25,414
it's really,
you know,

2171
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,600
at 45 now what I'm able to do is just sit
and let things come to me a little bit

2172
02:00:31,271 --> 02:00:33,870
more.
I don't have to reach as much or,

2173
02:00:33,871 --> 02:00:38,871
or I can just be and trust what's
inside of me to do the job well.

2174
02:00:39,581 --> 02:00:43,740
You also get to a point where you stop
trying to be someone else. That's huge.

2175
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:47,740
That's so huge. It takes a while, man.
And be easy on yourself. You know,

2176
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:50,740
don't be easy on yourself. Why?
What I mean by that is don't,

2177
02:00:50,741 --> 02:00:54,190
don't be too critical of yourself. Just
know it's a process. It's a process.

2178
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:57,160
It's going to keep doing it. Don't
listen when it, it's going to be painful.

2179
02:00:57,161 --> 02:00:59,770
It's fuck. Be Very critical of yourself
or you're not going to get anywhere.

2180
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:02,280
It's like you're going to be honest
with yourself. You want I us,

2181
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,790
you and I were never critical
of each other. We were,

2182
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:06,190
we were honest with each other.
Remember, very important all the way,

2183
02:01:06,191 --> 02:01:08,770
and we still are. We were, we would
call each other and we're like,

2184
02:01:08,771 --> 02:01:11,920
we have conversations where we're not
critical cause we love each other.

2185
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:15,100
We're like, hey dude, let me
bring your attention to something.

2186
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:18,900
You may not be seen, but you know
what? In both of our credit, you,

2187
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:21,430
whatever you've done it to me
whenever I've done a deal, you're, oh,

2188
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:24,700
you're always like, Yep, you're right.
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much.

2189
02:01:24,701 --> 02:01:28,480
I love it. When you do that are
important. It's huge. Let you look.

2190
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:32,380
I welcome that, man. That's when
you know, you have a real friend.

2191
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:36,940
When someone you calls and says, hey
dude, you can do better and this is why.

2192
02:01:36,941 --> 02:01:40,010
Or you know, you're not living
up to the dude at first. You

2193
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,650
don't. You don't want to hear it and maybe
it will bug you for a couple of days.

2194
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:45,620
It's beautiful.
Learn to learn to love that shit.

2195
02:01:45,621 --> 02:01:48,770
Don't take criticism from somebody who
does know what they're doing and don't

2196
02:01:48,771 --> 02:01:50,540
fucking just take blind cords and or,
or,

2197
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:54,590
or people who want to humiliate you or
get better and be better than you with

2198
02:01:54,591 --> 02:01:56,540
their stupid words.
I'm not talking about that.

2199
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:59,180
I'm talking about somebody who can,
who's on your side,

2200
02:01:59,181 --> 02:02:03,230
who wants to give you
constructive criticism. Embrace
that Shit, man. Embrace it.

2201
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:06,110
Yeah.
It's just hard to find likeminded folks.

2202
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:09,800
It's hard to find people that also have
their shit together or want to get their

2203
02:02:09,801 --> 02:02:10,634
shit together.

2204
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:15,880
It's hard to find people who are also
like on the right track and not trying to

2205
02:02:15,981 --> 02:02:18,200
sabotage themselves all the time.
But I said before,

2206
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:21,170
sometimes you might have to change your
gang magic changes people you work run

2207
02:02:21,171 --> 02:02:23,660
with. Well. That's why when you
and I first met, I would get,

2208
02:02:23,690 --> 02:02:26,900
I would get mad at these fucking idiots
you were hanging out with and there was

2209
02:02:26,901 --> 02:02:29,720
a difference between you and I say you
would suffer all these fools and I would

2210
02:02:29,721 --> 02:02:31,670
come along, especially when
I was young, when I was,

2211
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:35,480
I mean we met when we were in our
20s I was a savage. You were a ball,

2212
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:37,670
were a ball of hate and energy.

2213
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:42,500
I just wasn't into no one's nonsense if
you are trying to loose nonsense on me.

2214
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:46,760
Nope. Sorry Dude. And you'd see
it like this guy's a problem.

2215
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:50,660
It's goes is nonsense. Just talking
nonsense. He wants too much tension.

2216
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:53,660
You're going to hang out with him cause
I'm getting Outta here and that's the

2217
02:02:53,661 --> 02:02:54,320
only way to live.

2218
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:57,680
You were so good at removing yourself
from any kind of suppressive energy. Dude.

2219
02:02:57,681 --> 02:03:00,440
You had guys around you
that were straight conmen.

2220
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,740
It was really unfortunate
to see imposters yeah,

2221
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:07,160
I would be around you and you would bring
these guys over like a party at your

2222
02:03:07,161 --> 02:03:09,340
house or something like that. Yeah.
Cause I have to look at cost manning.

2223
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:13,520
It was fun. Look at this male hustler
he has hanging out at his house.

2224
02:03:13,521 --> 02:03:15,590
Like this guy could be doing anything.

2225
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:19,100
You'll be a fake psychic Kiki's
fucking completely full of shit.

2226
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:21,640
He's just decided that this
is going to be his thing, man.

2227
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:25,610
It's La La so far that she's
so full of broken people

2228
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:29,750
who does that? Who said, who said somebody
took the continental United States,

2229
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:33,110
turn it on its side and everything.
Loose role to California. Well,

2230
02:03:33,111 --> 02:03:37,340
you think about what California is. It's
two things that are weird about it. One,

2231
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:40,940
it's people that weren't
satisfied with the east coast.

2232
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:44,510
Everybody landed on the east coast
and then here to reinvent themselves.

2233
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:45,980
They can't,
they kept going.

2234
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:49,490
They were willing to cross
the fucking rocky mountains.

2235
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:52,230
So just that the beginning is just crazy.

2236
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:55,280
The fact that anybody knew that
it was anything cool over here.

2237
02:03:55,281 --> 02:03:58,330
It's crazy to begin with that, you
know, the 20s they started doing.

2238
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:00,710
I might just send a letter
though, man. I can, I'll take it.

2239
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:03,310
I don't want it anymore. I
want some rain. I think, uh,

2240
02:04:03,311 --> 02:04:06,560
I like the winter here the best because
the winter, it rains all the time.

2241
02:04:06,561 --> 02:04:09,530
It rains like once a week. And
that's what we fucking need, man.

2242
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:12,530
It's not natural to be living in a
place where it doesn't rain. And,

2243
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:16,520
and when you really realize that
it's when there's fires. I mean,

2244
02:04:16,521 --> 02:04:19,100
there's all these fucking brush
fires in California every,

2245
02:04:19,101 --> 02:04:21,330
every couple of years or so.
There's a brush fire. Well,

2246
02:04:21,331 --> 02:04:24,260
you're not talking about moving
to Colorado. Dude, I'm down.

2247
02:04:24,410 --> 02:04:26,480
But Colorado just had
massive fires as well.

2248
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:31,130
We had a big plot of land and built
some fucking credit. Credit village,

2249
02:04:31,131 --> 02:04:34,830
grow our own food, have pigs,
we can shoot from a chopper.

2250
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:38,010
That's very important. Well,
the pig's really could get

2251
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:41,850
out of hand when they're feral. We've
got to have a gym, Jujitsu Gym. Yes.

2252
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:47,220
Rifle ranch, my pip podcast.
The tomorrow or the next day,

2253
02:04:47,221 --> 02:04:50,880
I'm going to be interviewing Nate,
Mark Court, uh, Strikeforce champion.

2254
02:04:50,881 --> 02:04:52,950
I'm looking forward to
that in Colorado. Yeah, no,

2255
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:56,160
I'll be in Vegas this weekend at
the Paris. Ladies and gentlemen.

2256
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:59,910
What's he's doing standing on and
is he training in Vegas? Uh, he's,

2257
02:04:59,911 --> 02:05:02,610
he's a coach on the ultimate fighter.
He is.

2258
02:05:02,770 --> 02:05:04,450
So I'm going to go in there
and meet the guys. Oh,

2259
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:08,620
he's one of the assistant coaches
the country. Yeah, I think so.

2260
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:13,110
Shane car when of course. Right?
Yeah. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah.

2261
02:05:13,540 --> 02:05:17,360
Colin and big country are eventually
gonna fight. Colin's got 'em man,

2262
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:21,120
the poor guys had a lot of bad luck.
He just keeps getting these operations.

2263
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:23,050
I was getting injured.
He had yeah,

2264
02:05:23,150 --> 02:05:27,330
back operation is how to get his nose
reconstructed and then he broke it in the

2265
02:05:27,331 --> 02:05:29,430
next fight.
Fucked it up again.

2266
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:32,160
It's such a hard job and that's what
kills me about a lot of these guys don't

2267
02:05:32,161 --> 02:05:36,570
make enough money and they know it's
tough. Need to. What, what is, um,

2268
02:05:36,990 --> 02:05:40,150
uh, who do you think is the toughest
heavyweight in the world? Is a junior.

2269
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:43,980
Junior is the champ and the,
until anybody beats junior,

2270
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:46,040
you look at what junior
did to Cain Velasquez,

2271
02:05:46,070 --> 02:05:49,950
we'll get junior did to frank mir
juniors, a bad motherfucker. He's, he's,

2272
02:05:50,010 --> 02:05:52,020
he's a better boxer and
a really good boxer.

2273
02:05:52,021 --> 02:05:55,830
He's really hard to take down
and he's a really good MMA boxer.

2274
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:57,180
And the difference between MMA,

2275
02:05:57,181 --> 02:06:00,420
boxing and boxing with big
gloves is that you can't,

2276
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:04,320
you can't protect yourself the same way
with just like a high guard and blocking

2277
02:06:04,321 --> 02:06:08,460
things cause the gloves are small and
they can slip through openings and catch

2278
02:06:08,461 --> 02:06:09,840
her chin or catch her temple.

2279
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:13,500
Whereas like you have the big gloves on
and you could pick off a lot more shots

2280
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:18,600
and also an MMA boxing of course you have
to realize it with the smaller gloves

2281
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:22,800
they can, they can, they can hit
you and do more damage as well.

2282
02:06:22,801 --> 02:06:26,310
There's less padding on the glove so
you can't take a shot that you might be

2283
02:06:26,311 --> 02:06:29,670
able to take with a, a bigger glove
margin for error is way slimmer.

2284
02:06:29,671 --> 02:06:32,880
You make one mistake and get clipped.
Right. You're done. So Juniors,

2285
02:06:32,881 --> 02:06:37,590
the best MMA boxer, you know, he's the
best at MMA boxing where it's like,

2286
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:41,880
you know, Bladimir Klitschko would
probably fuck him up. It's regular boxer.

2287
02:06:41,881 --> 02:06:45,390
It's a different style. And
also, you know, dealing with

2288
02:06:46,890 --> 02:06:49,140
his, his footwork is
unbelievable. Oh yeah.

2289
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:52,260
And that guy is always moving and hitting
the sand. You think you won that fight?

2290
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:55,180
Um, I don't know. I
watched it and I lost it.

2291
02:06:55,920 --> 02:07:00,090
I can't make that call.
I think that at the end of the day,

2292
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:02,640
what's his name was the champion.

2293
02:07:02,641 --> 02:07:03,980
You've got to take the
belt away from the chant.

2294
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:06,750
They sent designation
decisively taken away. You know,

2295
02:07:07,290 --> 02:07:11,790
he mean Frankie lost to him
before that do close fight.

2296
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:16,230
He's the toughest small man on
the planet. And I think that, uh,

2297
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:19,140
I mean Ben hadn't been Henderson's since
a lot bigger than he is physically,

2298
02:07:19,141 --> 02:07:22,980
you know. Um, but, but that's par for
the course for Frankie Edgar. So I,

2299
02:07:22,981 --> 02:07:26,220
I don't know, man. I don't know enough
about fighting honestly to be able to say,

2300
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:31,260
I don't know. He's going to go to one
45 now, apparently. But Frankie is,

2301
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:36,220
he's got all that to contend with. Then
that scares me. Oh, hold on. All those

2302
02:07:36,230 --> 02:07:38,800
scary as fuck. I don't know what you
do with those leg kicks. It should be.

2303
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:43,200
And his knees to his knees. He knocked
Chad Mendez. I would have named. He's a,

2304
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:47,110
he's a fucking bad money cars.
Everyone in these weight class,

2305
02:07:47,111 --> 02:07:52,100
it's like the 55 45 and the 70 they're
just killers man for that matter. 85 yeah.

2306
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:53,980
Well that's what the,
the whole sport is now.

2307
02:07:53,981 --> 02:07:58,981
What it's getting to be now is like
all these guys who have no weaknesses,

2308
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:02,270
they have great take down the fence. They
have great stand up. They have great,

2309
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:04,960
I mean all those worldclass in Jujitsu,
that's,

2310
02:08:04,961 --> 02:08:09,670
that's a word that gets tossed around a
lot. He's world class. He's a very high,

2311
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:11,500
he,
I think he be called Cabrina.

2312
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:16,530
He's beaten like really big name Jujitsu
guys in straight Jujitsu competitions

2313
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:21,570
and his, his fucking standup game. This
was everybody's scared of, I mean it's,

2314
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:25,360
it's amazing. Like when he got
Mike Brown, he got Mike Brown.

2315
02:08:25,361 --> 02:08:27,640
When he won the title,
he got Mike Brown on the,

2316
02:08:27,641 --> 02:08:31,060
on the ground and got us back in a
heartbeat and just battered him from that

2317
02:08:31,061 --> 02:08:34,660
position. But the way he got his back, I
was like, that is some high level shit.

2318
02:08:34,661 --> 02:08:35,860
Mike Brown is good.

2319
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:40,890
Mike Brown is Mike Brown is also still
a strong shit that was telling me and I

2320
02:08:41,651 --> 02:08:42,484
know Mike,
you know,

2321
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:45,040
and Mike came out to my stand up
actually in West Palm beach is great.

2322
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:48,490
He's a great guy. He's a great
guy. And, and Mike, Mike,

2323
02:08:48,530 --> 02:08:51,910
I've talked to guys who've rolled with
might, they go, he's gorilla strong dude.

2324
02:08:51,911 --> 02:08:55,600
He goes, when you get on
you, you're not getting off.
You're not, you're not moving.

2325
02:08:55,601 --> 02:09:00,110
That guy is just a gorilla. He's strong
as fuck. And although took his back like,

2326
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:03,250
like a ghost. Yeah. Although he
told me about that fight. It goes,

2327
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:07,030
he said his hips were just so good cause
I tried to do shit in his hips were

2328
02:09:07,031 --> 02:09:09,880
like fucking, you know. Well
the thing there were, um,

2329
02:09:09,970 --> 02:09:13,630
a lot of people are concentrating on
his soccer players that there's uh,

2330
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:18,370
another facet of a, of, of
like everyone has always said,

2331
02:09:18,371 --> 02:09:22,250
well wrestlers, it's supportive. You know,
wrestlers is a great base. And you know,

2332
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:26,080
some people's like kickboxing, that's a
great base. But lately soccer players,

2333
02:09:26,081 --> 02:09:29,330
a lot of people are looking at soccer
players that eventually get into Jujitsu.

2334
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:32,770
And kickboxing because they
have so much better movement.

2335
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:35,890
Their movement like forward and backward,
they're there.

2336
02:09:35,891 --> 02:09:40,891
Their whole game is about jumping through
the air and running across a field and

2337
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:44,890
dodging to the left and dodging to the
right and kicking a ball before anybody

2338
02:09:44,891 --> 02:09:46,180
else can kick it.
By the way,

2339
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:49,210
they also learn how to kick because
if you've ever tried, try some time,

2340
02:09:49,211 --> 02:09:50,500
get her d one soccer player,

2341
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:53,290
try to stop that ball and
watch how fast it comes from.

2342
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:58,180
It's crazy and they know how to place it,
so they developed this leg dexterity.

2343
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,920
That's why although has
that wicked leg kick,

2344
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:03,880
his leg kick is so powerful,
man.

2345
02:10:03,881 --> 02:10:08,510
He just whips it around and slams
that fucking shin bone in your legs.

2346
02:10:08,910 --> 02:10:10,780
Your I favor about that.
He was like,

2347
02:10:10,781 --> 02:10:12,610
I thought I was going to
faint when he kicked me,

2348
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:16,420
so I thought I was going to
literally faint. He said it
was crazy. Yeah, that's a,

2349
02:10:16,421 --> 02:10:20,700
that's another new sort of
a an entry point into MMA.

2350
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:22,750
It was professional level soccer players,

2351
02:10:22,930 --> 02:10:26,200
which although was although was
like ready to go professional,

2352
02:10:26,350 --> 02:10:27,161
but there's that good.

2353
02:10:27,161 --> 02:10:32,161
Seems like MMA is more and
more gravitating toward
those that can be that our

2354
02:10:33,141 --> 02:10:36,350
master strikers, because in a way,
you've got two really good wrestlers,

2355
02:10:36,351 --> 02:10:38,730
they can kind of cancel
each other out after awhile.

2356
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:41,760
Like all the more you wrestled in MMA,
it,

2357
02:10:41,761 --> 02:10:46,190
it doesn't necessarily pay off the way.
Spending time,

2358
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:47,780
being an excellent striker,

2359
02:10:47,781 --> 02:10:50,960
understanding angles and all that
speed and all that seems to be,

2360
02:10:50,961 --> 02:10:52,880
because you can end the fight so quickly.
Yeah.

2361
02:10:52,881 --> 02:10:55,350
But you also have to have ticked
on defense. Yeah. You have to have,

2362
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:58,270
if you don't have to take down defense,
the striking doesn't mean anything.

2363
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:01,960
But it seems like if you have two really
good NCAA wrestlers or Olympic rusks,

2364
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:05,570
they're gonna, they're gonna, it's gonna
be hard to take either one of them down.

2365
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:08,900
So that's why they're going to stand
up now and see how well, you know,

2366
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:11,570
a lot of the wrestlers they
develop, develop, uh, you know,

2367
02:11:11,571 --> 02:11:15,800
in St punching power too because they
learn how to throw themselves into a punch

2368
02:11:15,801 --> 02:11:18,300
to where they would throw themselves
into power double, you know,

2369
02:11:18,301 --> 02:11:22,400
like look at Dan Henderson like Dan
Henderson who was more of a Greco wrestler

2370
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:26,600
or King Mo King Mo is a good example how
a motherfucker can punch and one of the

2371
02:11:26,601 --> 02:11:29,950
reasons why I could punch, cause he knows
how to throw his body into things. Yeah.

2372
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:31,800
You know,
he's used to like putting the,

2373
02:11:31,810 --> 02:11:35,450
some serious horsepower into his double
legs and he puts that into his right

2374
02:11:35,451 --> 02:11:38,680
hand.
Now I'm Bob drops that shit on.

2375
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:42,050
That's why when you see guys like John
Jones and Anderson and how they separate

2376
02:11:42,051 --> 02:11:44,780
themselves and GSP,
there are really extraordinary people.

2377
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:49,190
There's just something about him. First
of all, John's very physically gifted.

2378
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:53,750
Yeah. The distance of his limbs.
How tall is he? Six. Three.

2379
02:11:53,751 --> 02:11:57,170
But his limbs are, he's got
longer arms, maybe six, four,

2380
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:01,810
but he's got longer arms than
semi Schulte. Who's a heavyweight.

2381
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:04,040
It was the k one
heavyweight, uh, Grand Prix,

2382
02:12:04,041 --> 02:12:07,780
multiple time champion because
no one could get in on semi semi.

2383
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:11,260
His arms and legs are so long
that everybody got fucked
up trying to get you on

2384
02:12:11,261 --> 02:12:12,710
me,
including guys like Badr Hari.

2385
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:16,100
And he dropped them with like front
kicks to the body and shit is semi seven

2386
02:12:16,101 --> 02:12:20,420
feet tall. Well John has longer arms
than him and he's six foot four. Wow.

2387
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:23,510
He's got a crazy Lao arms
and legs and the reach,

2388
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:25,880
when we measure reach in MMA,

2389
02:12:25,881 --> 02:12:30,050
we only measure from the shoulder to the
hands, you know, to like the fingertips,

2390
02:12:30,051 --> 02:12:32,630
like how far you can touch.
But that's not real reach for him.

2391
02:12:32,631 --> 02:12:37,010
And maybe because you got to factor in
the legs and John's legs are so fucking

2392
02:12:37,011 --> 02:12:39,530
long, he can kick you from a place
where you can't even touch it.

2393
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:43,040
I want to watch him fight shogun and he
looked like it just in a dick completely

2394
02:12:43,041 --> 02:12:46,190
different weight class. I've got
different human being and by the way,

2395
02:12:46,191 --> 02:12:49,970
he's only been striking for
four years. Shogun is, you know,

2396
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,110
a long time and I may
champions is crazy gifted,

2397
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:58,230
very gifted. He's a super athlete. He's
just one of those guys that he's like,

2398
02:12:58,270 --> 02:13:03,170
and it's the perfect storm of
being a smart guy. Being a guy,

2399
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:07,130
works hard, who has good
coaching and is a great athlete.

2400
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:11,630
All of them together and with, with crazy
physical attributes. You know, John,

2401
02:13:11,631 --> 02:13:13,970
every time you see him is better. You
know, you've seen him six months later,

2402
02:13:13,971 --> 02:13:16,580
he's way better fighter than he was
six months. I said, loves what he does.

2403
02:13:16,581 --> 02:13:19,010
It seems like he's just so enthusiastic.
And if that's the truth,

2404
02:13:19,011 --> 02:13:21,050
he should have taken the Chelsea
on and fight next weekend.

2405
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:24,620
He passed on that fight on
eight days notice, which I,

2406
02:13:24,621 --> 02:13:28,250
I thought I could see his point of view,
but I would've if I was in his corner,

2407
02:13:28,251 --> 02:13:30,140
I want to say that you eat this,
you're going to beat this guy.

2408
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:33,960
Like this is a guy who's coming up from
85 you're a way better fighter than him

2409
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:35,990
and you gotta make it look
like a hero that you, you,

2410
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:37,890
you accepted this fight on short notice.

2411
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:41,640
And you get to silence Chael Sonnen Moods.
He's talking a lot of shit about you.

2412
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:44,980
They just shut them down, beat his ass
and that's all done. You know, it's uh,

2413
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:47,640
and it's an opportunity to
make some money, but he didn't,

2414
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,480
he felt like it was too big of a change
to, to change up with eight days.

2415
02:13:51,630 --> 02:13:55,080
And it could've been also that chail
had been taunting him and so he didn't,

2416
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:59,430
you know, didn't want to like, um,
also also there's, if, if it's also,

2417
02:13:59,431 --> 02:14:03,870
if you lose is if you win a big deal, you
know, he was supposed to, if he loses,

2418
02:14:03,871 --> 02:14:06,360
it's a big deal. Yeah. But
if he wins, it's still big.

2419
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:11,310
You just still establishes himself as
a bad motherfucker and a scary dude.

2420
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:12,810
This is what he is,
you know,

2421
02:14:12,811 --> 02:14:16,620
the way he shut down rampaged the way he
shut down were shod. The, we choked out.

2422
02:14:16,621 --> 02:14:18,060
Machida.
I mean,

2423
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:23,010
I just don't see that Chels son and
being able to deal with that skillset,

2424
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:23,881
I think chill.

2425
02:14:23,881 --> 02:14:28,200
If you had a full camp and really got a
chance to really bulk up to two oh five

2426
02:14:28,201 --> 02:14:31,920
for legit where he's, you know, then it
would be a different story that you know,

2427
02:14:31,921 --> 02:14:35,310
and I may, I may though, I'm just saying
that anything can happen in this sport,

2428
02:14:35,311 --> 02:14:38,430
right?
So as a fighter you're aware of that,

2429
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:42,150
you know and you have to contend with
that directly and and emotionally and all

2430
02:14:42,151 --> 02:14:43,320
those rematch clause.

2431
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:46,200
So you have a rematch clause so chill
submits them or something like that.

2432
02:14:46,201 --> 02:14:48,810
It's got a rematch clause and
the rematch is even bigger.

2433
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:50,370
It'd be fucking gigantic.

2434
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:55,380
I also think maybe maybe that card in
UFC seems to be very aggressive about

2435
02:14:55,710 --> 02:14:58,350
putting on a lot more events than
they used to and maybe they could,

2436
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:01,260
maybe they could scale it back a
little bit and I don't think they can.

2437
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:05,010
I think with fuel TV,
with responsibility for Fx,

2438
02:15:05,070 --> 02:15:08,190
yeah there's more demand.
There's is there though or is there,

2439
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:12,360
is there more demand or is there just more
obligation because of their contracts?

2440
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:14,730
That's that's good point.
Good point. But there is more,

2441
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:18,000
there's not just obligations because
of the contract is obligations for the

2442
02:15:18,001 --> 02:15:21,810
amount of fighters that are under
contract for the UFC that you have to keep

2443
02:15:21,811 --> 02:15:24,890
working. You can't have a guy on
the contract and not having worked,

2444
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:27,780
but once a year, fuck,
how's he going to survive?

2445
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:32,580
Fighters have to fight at least two,
three times a year. I mean, and you don't,

2446
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:35,160
you can't do that unless you
put it on a lot of events.

2447
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:39,090
The UFC has more than 250
fighters under contract,

2448
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:42,750
and I think it's more than that. And
that's a lot. That's a big responsibility.

2449
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:46,020
People knocked in a white and stuff like
that, but that's a big responsibility.

2450
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:49,980
He has to all those fighters and
now the WEC doesn't exist anymore.

2451
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:54,300
So because the WEC doesn't exist anymore,
now we have all the 30 fives.

2452
02:15:54,301 --> 02:15:58,920
All the 45 to 50 fives had already
been assimilated a while back.

2453
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:01,530
Why not? Because they couldn't
stay in business. The WEC. No,

2454
02:16:01,531 --> 02:16:04,290
they just figured it didn't make any
sense to keep the two of them together.

2455
02:16:04,291 --> 02:16:09,210
When you have guys like,
uh, like Donald Serone,

2456
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:10,800
you have guys like Benson Henderson,

2457
02:16:10,801 --> 02:16:12,710
he's great fighters that
were fighting the WEC.

2458
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:14,610
Now look pencillins since
the UFC champion now,

2459
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:17,760
I mean obviously there's guys
weren't getting a shot at the top.

2460
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:20,970
Can you see what Penson did when he
got there? He Won. Won The whole thing.

2461
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:25,500
So the Benson being the WEC champion
and now and now being the UFC champion

2462
02:16:25,710 --> 02:16:27,950
really lends credence to the fact that,
you know,

2463
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:32,080
it was a good move to bring those guys
in to incorporate them in those other,

2464
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:35,530
it's actually, there's some really good
fighters over there. Mike Chandler,

2465
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:39,480
it's really good. He's the lightweight
fighter. He's a, he beat any Alvarez.

2466
02:16:39,481 --> 02:16:41,050
There's also really fucking good.

2467
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:45,740
Those two guys are both world
class and uh, and then there's, um,

2468
02:16:45,790 --> 02:16:49,650
what are you expecting more from the 85
or about Torah came over. Yeah. Yeah.

2469
02:16:49,670 --> 02:16:51,760
Hector Lombard. He was,
apparently he was hurt.

2470
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:55,840
Apparently he had a cracked sternum. Oh
Wow. Yeah. And he fought anyway. He just,

2471
02:16:56,020 --> 02:17:00,880
he just didn't have anything about that.
So we had, it wasn't much he could do.

2472
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:03,160
Yeah. Apparently he just didn't
have anything in the gas tank.

2473
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:03,911
I'll tell you what though.

2474
02:17:03,911 --> 02:17:08,320
His fucking takedowns or ridiculous and
his take down defense was ridiculous and

2475
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:13,360
they say it's five 10 he's five eight
he's five eight and down in American top

2476
02:17:13,361 --> 02:17:16,270
team I made a good study
and hand ball of hard rope.

2477
02:17:16,271 --> 02:17:19,210
I've never seen anything like it.
He's, he says he's as much easy.

2478
02:17:19,450 --> 02:17:24,310
He's an extreme mesomorph that's what
he is like. He's this thick and strong.

2479
02:17:24,311 --> 02:17:27,160
I looked at his legs at American top team
who's just training and I just looked

2480
02:17:27,161 --> 02:17:31,600
at his legs and I was like, he,
I mean Tiago others is my boy.

2481
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:32,620
He's a thick guy.

2482
02:17:32,621 --> 02:17:35,840
He walks around at about two oh
five and he's about five eight okay.

2483
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:41,230
Lombard is a lot bigger than he is.
Lumbars so ridiculous.

2484
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:45,670
His judo skills are so sick that it's
take down the fence or ridiculous.

2485
02:17:46,530 --> 02:17:49,330
Tim Boetsch grabbed a hold
and he's like, nope, I'm in.

2486
02:17:49,331 --> 02:17:53,920
Bosch is a big guy coming down from
two oh five, he's a big one 80 fiver.

2487
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:58,450
And you know the, when, when, when lumbar
wanted to take him down, he took him down,

2488
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:03,370
grabbed him, clamped his arms together,
up in the air, boom. It's like,

2489
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:06,250
but he just didn't do enough,
didn't do enough in lots of decision,

2490
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:09,210
but he's still a scary
fuck. And I think, uh,

2491
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:13,450
his next fight he's going to open up a
can on somebody's Anderson's next fight

2492
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:16,690
is who knows?
There's a,

2493
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:21,670
he actually offered to step in and fight
before he knew the card was canceled.

2494
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:25,420
He heard that they were without a main
event. He said he's not an 85 pound shape,

2495
02:18:25,421 --> 02:18:28,720
but he can make two oh five. So he said,
I'll fight any two or five pounder.

2496
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:30,730
And he wasn't even in shape,
like fighting,

2497
02:18:30,731 --> 02:18:33,670
fighting shit and talking about
fighting him. John Jones, no,

2498
02:18:33,671 --> 02:18:36,040
he wouldn't have fight Jon Jones because
he said he wasn't in shape to fight

2499
02:18:36,041 --> 02:18:38,260
that guy. But he said, I'll fight
any other two oh five pounder.

2500
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:41,890
So if they could get an opponent for him,
some one 85 you know,

2501
02:18:41,891 --> 02:18:44,340
some two or five pounder wants to step up,
fight Machida,

2502
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:46,570
they're out of the same house.
They won't find Machida,

2503
02:18:46,571 --> 02:18:50,020
but there's a lot of other guys at
two Oh five they could've put if,

2504
02:18:50,070 --> 02:18:53,830
if he had called up just to probably a
couple of days before they probably would

2505
02:18:53,831 --> 02:18:56,790
have done that, but they were
scrambling for him that we had.

2506
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:59,480
That would be interesting. We
haven't seen Anderson. Yeah,

2507
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:01,870
anybody at two Oh five for sure.

2508
02:19:02,170 --> 02:19:06,430
There's a lot of good fights at to Forrest
Griffin and what he did to a lot of

2509
02:19:06,431 --> 02:19:09,820
tools. I would like to see him
against like Glover Glover to share.

2510
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:13,420
Glover is a the scariest for Jon Jones
at two Oh five and nobody even knows who

2511
02:19:13,421 --> 02:19:18,250
Glover is. Glover's on monster. Really?
Oh, he's a monster. Yeah, he's scary.

2512
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:19,360
He's big.

2513
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:23,410
He's about to 30 it cuts down to two oh
five but he doesn't have any weaknesses.

2514
02:19:23,411 --> 02:19:26,800
He's punching power is ridiculous. It's
got an iron chin. He's a black belt in.

2515
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:30,920
Apparently he was training with
Leo Machida and rag doll in them.

2516
02:19:31,140 --> 02:19:35,180
That's the word. Yeah, but it's a
question also of his standup is not,

2517
02:19:35,181 --> 02:19:39,740
it's not just about punching power, it's
about angles and folk lover is a killer.

2518
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:43,700
He is the one guy that is worldclass
that wasn't in the UFC until really

2519
02:19:43,701 --> 02:19:45,500
recently because he had a visa problem.

2520
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:50,540
He couldn't fight in America six years
from Brazil and he finally got a fight in

2521
02:19:50,541 --> 02:19:53,750
the UFC and fuck Kyle Kingsbury and
just blew them out of the water.

2522
02:19:53,751 --> 02:19:55,970
I mean it was,
it was scary fight to watch,

2523
02:19:56,150 --> 02:19:59,680
but he's beaten a lot of high level guys.
He was the first guy to beat Soca.

2524
02:19:59,681 --> 02:20:03,800
Julie Knox. So could you out? He's, he's
beating the fuck out of a lot of guys.

2525
02:20:03,801 --> 02:20:08,060
You fucked up. Marvin Eastman
in Brazil. He's a beast man.
He's a scary, scary dude.

2526
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:12,980
That fight is a fight that shogun turned
down show that they offered shogun

2527
02:20:12,981 --> 02:20:15,590
Glover to share and he said didn't
think it made any sense to them.

2528
02:20:15,591 --> 02:20:19,100
It's like this guy's like world class
and nobody knows who he is and Shogun

2529
02:20:19,101 --> 02:20:23,060
didn't want to find them. Shogun one up
fighting Brandon Vera instead, you know,

2530
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:25,640
which was a great fight.
What a fucking crazy fight that was.

2531
02:20:25,650 --> 02:20:29,990
Hold on that incident. Oh shogun did. But
he had some tough times. It was Brandon.

2532
02:20:30,050 --> 02:20:33,140
Brandon put up a great fight. Brandon
was there. I think he was at the, uh,

2533
02:20:33,230 --> 02:20:35,850
I think he's taking pictures of people.
I think he was at the good looking kid.

2534
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:39,590
Yeah, big guy. He was there.
Yeah, he was at the Denver.

2535
02:20:39,591 --> 02:20:42,290
He's really a nice guy taking pictures.
He's a great guy. He's a Greg.

2536
02:20:42,291 --> 02:20:44,780
He got a bad rap for a while.
He's a great dude. I love Brandon.

2537
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,000
But that was a credible,
incredible fight.

2538
02:20:47,001 --> 02:20:49,280
But it's interesting that shogun was like,
you know,

2539
02:20:49,281 --> 02:20:53,270
one of those Glover to share a guy. Fuck
that. So you need to set up that fight.

2540
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:56,540
That's like, that's a fight where
people need to know who Glover is first.

2541
02:20:56,541 --> 02:20:59,780
Cause this is like gotta be worth a lot
of money. This is a risky ass fight.

2542
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:03,350
Glover is like the most unknown
guy at two oh five that's,

2543
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:07,280
that's super top level and scary.
I would love to see him versus Jon Jones.

2544
02:21:07,281 --> 02:21:10,610
I think that be very interesting
cause Glover's is really seasoned.

2545
02:21:10,611 --> 02:21:15,470
Stryker really seasoned and tough as
fucking nails, but he's got to do it soon.

2546
02:21:15,471 --> 02:21:19,760
I think he's 32 now.
You know John is John's fucking sky.

2547
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:23,540
You got, you got to handle it at
41 right? He's fucked up though.

2548
02:21:23,890 --> 02:21:25,580
His knees torn up now.
It's going to,

2549
02:21:25,581 --> 02:21:27,770
it's going to be a while
for him before he heals up.

2550
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:30,350
I've talked to other wrestlers
about Henderson. They say there's,

2551
02:21:30,351 --> 02:21:32,780
there's wrestling strong and then
there's Dan Henderson strong. Oh,

2552
02:21:32,781 --> 02:21:35,480
he's an animal. They say it's the
strongest guy in the planet. Well,

2553
02:21:35,481 --> 02:21:39,180
his massage guy that used to work on
him said he's never massage degree.

2554
02:21:39,181 --> 02:21:42,380
He said he's made out of wood. So there's
never a massage like that. A dentist,

2555
02:21:42,381 --> 02:21:45,860
you know his massage therapist
now and she said the same thing.

2556
02:21:45,861 --> 02:21:48,830
She said she looks, she goes, what did it,
I think she said to his father, he goes,

2557
02:21:48,831 --> 02:21:50,590
what do you, what did you feed
him? He goes, I didn't feed him.

2558
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:54,920
Just gave him a gun and talking about,
I'm on his own phone. There it is. Yeah.

2559
02:21:54,921 --> 02:21:58,010
He's always like, why don't we eat and the
stakes. I want to know I'm hungry. Yeah,

2560
02:21:58,050 --> 02:22:01,380
we will. The podcast is two
hours and 22 minutes old.

2561
02:22:01,381 --> 02:22:04,230
We just do a little more podcasting
and then we'll cut it loose. What?

2562
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:06,980
I'm getting hungry. You're going
to go to Alaska. You gotta come on.

2563
02:22:06,981 --> 02:22:09,950
Come on with you. 100% how can I
say no to that? You can't say no.

2564
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:13,360
I'm supposed to shoot out
a TV show my TV show my,

2565
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:17,360
I'll find my opening and I'm coming. It's
five days. Yeah. You gotta go? Yeah. Fuck.

2566
02:22:17,361 --> 02:22:20,420
Whatever. It's stupid TV show. It is. I'll
come and see. Do you still doing that?

2567
02:22:20,421 --> 02:22:25,280
Death Valley thing got canceled on a
bummer. So fun. So act six people saw it,

2568
02:22:25,281 --> 02:22:26,000
but I loved it.

2569
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:30,170
I was 16 I heard was 1616 people
good. Was it good? Was it a good idea?

2570
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:31,800
I had one of the best times I've ever had.
I played,

2571
02:22:32,070 --> 02:22:36,900
I played a perverted police
chief and it was, and I,

2572
02:22:36,901 --> 02:22:40,100
they let me just improvise and do my own.
It was all like werewolves and,

2573
02:22:40,190 --> 02:22:42,630
and it was so much fun.
You called me up.

2574
02:22:42,631 --> 02:22:45,150
I remember you told me
how it was and I would,

2575
02:22:45,151 --> 02:22:48,690
I would hold a meeting about our
current werewolf or a vampire problem.

2576
02:22:49,430 --> 02:22:54,430
I just let it happen that we got
obsessed with vampires and werewolves

2577
02:22:54,590 --> 02:22:57,900
Zeitgeisty I know what it
is. What is that? There was
a theory. I don't know. Well,

2578
02:22:57,920 --> 02:22:59,190
I think in those kinds of things,

2579
02:22:59,191 --> 02:23:02,130
a lot of times technology starts moving
so quickly and we just, you know,

2580
02:23:02,131 --> 02:23:05,430
it's all technical and stuff and we
just want something. We want resets.

2581
02:23:05,431 --> 02:23:09,120
We want magic. We wanted, we, I think
being afraid though. Well first of all,

2582
02:23:09,121 --> 02:23:12,930
I think what happened with, with
vampires was there really sexy, I mean,

2583
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:18,020
Brahms Stoker wrote Dracula in response
to the repressive Victorian age.

2584
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:24,320
It was essentially a metaphor for how
repressive we were on the surface.

2585
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:28,950
Yet how perverted we were underneath
and along comes as handsome as shit.

2586
02:23:28,951 --> 02:23:33,480
Guy Who comes in sucks your blood and
guess what? You you have an orgasm.

2587
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:35,110
That's what those girls were doing.

2588
02:23:35,140 --> 02:23:39,480
He'd come in hand some shit
with a Cape and suck your blood.

2589
02:23:39,481 --> 02:23:43,870
Suck your neck. Do you remember the
Gary and it would be like, oh yeah,

2590
02:23:43,871 --> 02:23:46,560
the diversity was super sexual.
Yes, it was sexual. It always was.

2591
02:23:46,561 --> 02:23:50,100
It was a response to that
repressive Victorian age
where everybody was terrified

2592
02:23:50,101 --> 02:23:54,690
as syphilis and going to hell and at
the end of the day they were all fucking

2593
02:23:54,691 --> 02:23:58,670
each other. They'd be Yang and then
dresses up and just rail each as,

2594
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:01,650
I shouldn't be doing this. I swear to
God. I go to church tomorrow. Well,

2595
02:24:01,651 --> 02:24:05,820
back then they used to put
dresses on legs of tables.

2596
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:10,020
They didn't want people being
sexually excited by piano lay eggs.

2597
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:14,990
They used to dress table legs. I
believe. You don't have to. It's a truth.

2598
02:24:15,290 --> 02:24:18,750
It's not a belief thing. It's
fucking craziness. People were nuts.

2599
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:20,540
People have always been
in a lot of societies,

2600
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:23,580
always been obsessed
with the sexual problem.

2601
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:26,310
That's why men and women everywhere
are allowed to work together because no

2602
02:24:26,311 --> 02:24:28,680
matter what,
when you get Pete men and women together,

2603
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:33,330
if shit happens the fuck.
That's why it's fascinating.

2604
02:24:33,820 --> 02:24:36,270
I've always been actually
most society so that history,

2605
02:24:36,271 --> 02:24:41,010
I've always been concerned and centered
around figuring out a way to to keep

2606
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:45,330
that wall up. It's really interesting
to anyone. They do it with guilt work.

2607
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:48,930
I do it with guilt. They make women feel
like slots if they're, if they have sex,

2608
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:52,110
they make men feel guilty and
a lot of it had to do with,

2609
02:24:52,111 --> 02:24:55,680
a lot of times you get a bad disease man
that you before penicillin and now they

2610
02:24:55,681 --> 02:24:58,590
got none. They got gonorrhea,
a strain gunnery in Japan.

2611
02:24:58,591 --> 02:25:02,920
That is a antibiotic resistant. Aye
Yai, Yai, Yai, Yai. Fucking Japan. Oh,

2612
02:25:02,921 --> 02:25:07,080
fucking Japan man. Not yet. Wait
until the cure. Yeah, exactly.

2613
02:25:07,140 --> 02:25:08,340
What don't need to come up with another.

2614
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:12,270
What is it about today though that
the vampires don't have vampire

2615
02:25:12,271 --> 02:25:13,410
characteristics?

2616
02:25:13,770 --> 02:25:17,640
It's like I was talking about
that movie Bourne legacy.

2617
02:25:18,490 --> 02:25:20,970
Did you see it? No. It's good fun moving,

2618
02:25:21,210 --> 02:25:26,020
but there's these is engineered super
killer who is constantly saving this hot

2619
02:25:26,021 --> 02:25:28,580
chick through this movie.
Constantly saving her. Yeah,

2620
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:33,400
just carrying or jumping and throwing over
his shoulder, jumping of fucking Chaz.

2621
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:37,570
Him with her never fucks her. And
I'm like, what is this nonsense?

2622
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:40,810
She is weeping.
She's holding onto him vault alone.

2623
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:44,600
They're alone in a house.
They're sleeping in the same room,

2624
02:25:44,601 --> 02:25:48,120
sailing a male fantasy. It's the
nonsense. You want to save a woman.

2625
02:25:48,121 --> 02:25:51,440
It's a girl fantasy, but it's the girl
fantasy because he doesn't fucker.

2626
02:25:51,450 --> 02:25:55,210
If it was a male fantasy B double
o seven he saves her Vinnie Foxer,

2627
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:57,390
but this guy just saves,
doesn't know,

2628
02:25:57,590 --> 02:26:01,360
doesn't even kiss her at the end of the
movie after they've been through so much

2629
02:26:01,361 --> 02:26:05,620
together, they're looking at each other
eye to eye and smiling. That's ads.

2630
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:09,460
No fucking, she doesn't pose cock couches
and starts talking to, what am I doing?

2631
02:26:09,461 --> 02:26:13,120
I shouldn't do this. I want them to love
and respect me, but I was cocky my mouth.

2632
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:16,570
Now there's none of that. It's, but
that's the same thing with vampires.

2633
02:26:16,570 --> 02:26:20,110
He's vampires. They can go out in
the sun now and they just sparkle.

2634
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:21,370
They just want to be with you.

2635
02:26:21,371 --> 02:26:25,180
They didn't want to kill you like they
eat deer blurb like what the fuck man,

2636
02:26:25,210 --> 02:26:28,460
that was. But that was the whole,
the reason twilight was so big,

2637
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:33,000
he was an outsider. He was a
leper and, and, and you know, he,

2638
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:36,040
she could only see him at night. It was
Romeo and Juliet. That's what it was.

2639
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:41,041
But it wasn't Romeo and Juliet because
Romeo was 14 to this motherfucker's a

2640
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:44,080
thousand years old. Okay.
He, she has a dilemma.

2641
02:26:44,081 --> 02:26:47,380
He writes several hundred
years old. Should I get turned
in? Be with them forever.

2642
02:26:47,650 --> 02:26:50,500
But she's a fucking high school kid.
What is wrong with him?

2643
02:26:50,501 --> 02:26:53,500
He's a creepy cocksucker I'll listen.
She was fucking cute.

2644
02:26:54,010 --> 02:26:57,640
It's all under clinical with that. And
he was in high school? No he wasn't. No,

2645
02:26:57,641 --> 02:27:00,530
he wasn't. [inaudible] was in high
school and the 18 hundreds no,

2646
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:02,470
he goes taking science class.
He didn't,

2647
02:27:02,471 --> 02:27:06,310
he like is everyone died from like the
Spanish flu or something like that.

2648
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:11,140
It was lines out, there was like the early
19 hundreds that guy was old as fuck.

2649
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:13,260
That's ridiculous. And manual. The, again,

2650
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:18,980
it's like top Herrera Dahmer was saying
dominoes that we were all hanging out

2651
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:21,490
one time long time ago and never
these girls there. And Doug goes,

2652
02:27:21,491 --> 02:27:26,240
those girls good looking. And I
go, yeah, they're fucking 21 yeah.

2653
02:27:26,250 --> 02:27:29,470
And they look pretty good
from here. And he goes, no,
because at that age, you know,

2654
02:27:29,471 --> 02:27:33,130
a girl could have a goat head. I wouldn't
really give a fuck 21 with a goat head.

2655
02:27:33,131 --> 02:27:35,710
I'd be like, bad gut check with
it. God has got a really nice body.

2656
02:27:35,711 --> 02:27:38,230
It's fine for me. She's 21 you know. Well,

2657
02:27:38,231 --> 02:27:43,231
it's funny that the thing comparing the
way gay men look at men as compared to

2658
02:27:44,261 --> 02:27:46,900
the way women look at men and with women,

2659
02:27:46,901 --> 02:27:51,760
what's important is the guy's eyes
smile on his jaw line with men,

2660
02:27:52,030 --> 02:27:54,670
with gay men, they've gives, Jews
don't even have to have heads.

2661
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:58,720
They just look at a body. If you could
find like a hot guy who was headless,

2662
02:27:58,721 --> 02:28:00,750
just stuck his fucking
hairy ass up in the air.

2663
02:28:00,751 --> 02:28:04,690
Guys would just be stroke and had
to be like, Yay. My Buddy, my buddy,

2664
02:28:04,691 --> 02:28:07,870
Kate's got a boyfriend,
his name is Stan and he wears his hair.

2665
02:28:07,871 --> 02:28:10,060
Everyone I did I tell you
this wrong. No, he didn't.

2666
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:14,340
Filipinos really good look and he's got
this bubble ass and big tits and spoons

2667
02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:17,260
heads. Yeah, just, he does a lot
of bench, you know, he's like, oh,

2668
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:20,170
he's got a full mouth. And my buddy
Keith is really my buddy Keith,

2669
02:28:20,171 --> 02:28:22,440
really macho and he makes
millions of dollars in a week.

2670
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:24,140
He was like staring at him
one time when he was like,

2671
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:28,630
look at him and then I'll
fucking beautiful this. And
I go, I was like, oh yeah.

2672
02:28:28,631 --> 02:28:32,180
And he goes, you know my, I put up with
all this bullshit. I go, why? He goes,

2673
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:36,590
look at that. And I was like, but I
get it. I was like, you're not even,

2674
02:28:36,650 --> 02:28:39,440
you're not really even gay.
You're just a dude who fox guys,

2675
02:28:39,441 --> 02:28:42,440
I'm not even sure that's like,
you're just so hyper mail that you got to,

2676
02:28:42,441 --> 02:28:46,610
you know. Oh, that's still,
he's gay guys are just guys,

2677
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:51,880
the guys sitting here. Listen
guy. All right guys smile.

2678
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:55,040
A lot of guys are into the Asian guys.

2679
02:28:55,310 --> 02:28:57,410
That's where Asian guys
are like cherished.

2680
02:28:57,710 --> 02:29:00,890
Whereas like Asian guys have a hard time
when it comes to white women or white

2681
02:29:00,891 --> 02:29:02,780
women or like the flight went and saw.

2682
02:29:02,781 --> 02:29:04,690
I went with some of the
cast from the hangover.

2683
02:29:04,730 --> 02:29:08,630
I went to the fucking lady boy show in
Thailand. Let me explain something to you.

2684
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:12,180
One day I'd last a day in jail
before I was banging the shit.

2685
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:16,310
Those fucking dudes. One day I'd
last. I'd be like, you know what?

2686
02:29:16,610 --> 02:29:21,590
You look up. Fuck it. And the
butter. The mouth. Boop kids.

2687
02:29:21,710 --> 02:29:26,150
Well, yes. What if his gun cock?
You'd be able to look down. Look Dude,

2688
02:29:26,151 --> 02:29:28,620
just put a Napkin over or something.
They're tiny. Anyway, push.

2689
02:29:30,170 --> 02:29:32,540
What have you felt your bull as
you're fucking him in the ass.

2690
02:29:32,541 --> 02:29:36,840
Who felt his cock slapping against
your butthole? How many drinks?

2691
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:42,290
Two drinks. I got to have at least
three do know. Otherwise it's gay.

2692
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:44,100
She got to tell him, I said,
you got to hold onto your cargo.

2693
02:29:44,110 --> 02:29:48,980
I fucking the slapping me and he look
up bro Bro. Gimme some masking tape.

2694
02:29:48,981 --> 02:29:51,500
I'll tape it right to your
belly button and, and don't,

2695
02:29:51,501 --> 02:29:53,840
don't fucking look me in
the eye and we'll go to,

2696
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,120
well how feminine did they look?

2697
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:57,820
There's some of the best looking
women I've ever seen in my,

2698
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:02,200
so the answer your fucking question.
Did they show their car?

2699
02:30:02,201 --> 02:30:05,300
Cause like what does it show?
They know they tape them down.

2700
02:30:05,301 --> 02:30:07,970
It's lady boys and let them
have had the operation already.

2701
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,420
So then what are they then
look Brody Stevens, ask him,

2702
02:30:11,421 --> 02:30:14,300
he was being liquor at his face was being
stroked and I looked at Brody, I go,

2703
02:30:14,301 --> 02:30:16,490
listen broadly,
if you,

2704
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:20,420
if you take that girl slash
guy home and fuck her tonight,

2705
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:23,890
you're not gay and I'll defend
you to the fucking day you die.

2706
02:30:23,890 --> 02:30:26,180
Cause that's one of the best looking
chicks I've ever seen in my life.

2707
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:31,220
And he was like, no, I care. But she
wears, look at it. I can't do that.

2708
02:30:31,221 --> 02:30:36,200
But they were fucking beautiful.
I a couple of months like,

2709
02:30:36,201 --> 02:30:38,990
that's a girl. There's no way that's
a guy. It's impossible at that a guy.

2710
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:40,850
And they were like, that's a guy. Go,

2711
02:30:40,851 --> 02:30:45,320
we had one on the man show
that was so pretty that uh,

2712
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:48,860
we were hanging out at the comedy
store and she was pulling up or he,

2713
02:30:48,861 --> 02:30:52,490
whatever you want to call her, was pulling
up in a car in Eddie Bravo was like,

2714
02:30:52,491 --> 02:30:56,930
whoa, check out this chick. That girl's
so pretty. I go, dude, that's a guy.

2715
02:30:56,960 --> 02:31:00,560
I was in Cheetahs. I was
a cheetahs in Vegas. Okay.

2716
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:03,830
And that's a big strip club.
And I,

2717
02:31:03,900 --> 02:31:08,900
there was a girl there with the cowboy
hat who had a line of men trying to bring

2718
02:31:09,591 --> 02:31:11,360
her into the room to have a dance.

2719
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:14,990
The reason I knew that that was
a guy was because on mad TV,

2720
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:18,920
one of our makeup women,
what used to be a guy and,

2721
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:23,760
and she was friends with this,
this person would become a woman.

2722
02:31:23,970 --> 02:31:27,960
So I knew that that was a
transsexual and she was also,

2723
02:31:27,961 --> 02:31:31,890
she was Vietnamese.
She was fucking gorgeous.

2724
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:36,360
Then she later got married
to a very wealthy, um,

2725
02:31:36,430 --> 02:31:39,450
well I think I can say it, I don't
want to say it, but he, he was a very,

2726
02:31:39,451 --> 02:31:40,880
very well known rocker.

2727
02:31:41,170 --> 02:31:45,020
I'm a guitarist and a rockstar.
Oh,

2728
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:48,540
rockstar. But he was a very, well,
he made a lot of money in a band,

2729
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:50,160
very popular band.
And he married,

2730
02:31:50,650 --> 02:31:54,240
he married her and which only gave
me more respect for him. Okay.

2731
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:59,370
Who is it? Come on. I
was, I don't want to say,

2732
02:31:59,371 --> 02:32:01,560
cause I actually know, I know,
but I don't want, I don't want to,

2733
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:03,180
I don't want to say because I don't want,

2734
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:05,910
I don't want them to know that
this person was stripping. I,

2735
02:32:05,911 --> 02:32:09,000
there's a lot of shit that goes on with
it. You know what I mean? I don't want to,

2736
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:10,653
well,
this guy,

2737
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:13,780
this guy that had become a girl that
Eddie Bravo had seen in the car,

2738
02:32:13,781 --> 02:32:17,570
we had her on the man show
and the man show was, uh,

2739
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:20,410
the band show and they see
that sign behind is it said,

2740
02:32:20,411 --> 02:32:23,680
make me hard to see that this sign
right here, that was the game.

2741
02:32:23,681 --> 02:32:24,970
The game was making me hard.

2742
02:32:24,971 --> 02:32:28,090
And what it was was we had an
electronic box over a dude's Dick.

2743
02:32:28,450 --> 02:32:31,750
And we would decide when the light would
go off as a red light on it and the

2744
02:32:31,751 --> 02:32:33,940
light would indicate
that he has an erection.

2745
02:32:34,300 --> 02:32:36,760
So we would have like different
things in front of him,

2746
02:32:36,761 --> 02:32:39,680
like a midget eating a banana,
you know,

2747
02:32:39,681 --> 02:32:42,960
like all these different things
that would give him a boner. Yeah,

2748
02:32:43,570 --> 02:32:47,110
it was a fun Gig. Um,
when we, when we did it,

2749
02:32:47,111 --> 02:32:50,890
we did one of them with a transsexual
and she was fucking hot, man.

2750
02:32:50,890 --> 02:32:55,000
I'm telling you, you would not be able to
tell. So she's on this guy's lap. Okay.

2751
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:58,990
And the guy's going to woo. They,
uh, she's got whipped cream.

2752
02:32:59,050 --> 02:33:02,680
She puts whip cream on her tits. He
sucks. The whipped cream offered tits.

2753
02:33:02,681 --> 02:33:06,340
Everybody's going fucking crazy.
The audience is going Shit House.

2754
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:10,920
Then she pulls out her
panties and unveils this,

2755
02:33:11,180 --> 02:33:16,180
this dick that looks like it had been
poisoned because she Jameel hormones.

2756
02:33:18,670 --> 02:33:22,840
So Dick was like black and sick.
It was like,

2757
02:33:22,841 --> 02:33:26,230
it had been like it would've been
atrophying was, yeah. Oh yeah, for sure.

2758
02:33:26,350 --> 02:33:30,160
Not just atrophying. It was like it was
completely cut off from the process,

2759
02:33:30,161 --> 02:33:33,490
like withered away and see now I
have a boner. Is that weird black?

2760
02:33:33,580 --> 02:33:35,800
It was a black Dick and she wasn't black.

2761
02:33:35,801 --> 02:33:39,880
She was like a Latina something another.
Yeah, but her dick was, but the dark,

2762
02:33:40,050 --> 02:33:42,820
it was tired.
It was rotting.

2763
02:33:42,940 --> 02:33:46,780
It was like it was running away and she
pulls it out in front of everybody in

2764
02:33:46,781 --> 02:33:51,781
front of the crowd and the
collective of everyone and the real,

2765
02:33:52,480 --> 02:33:57,070
the look of repulsion in the guy's eyes.
Oh my God.

2766
02:33:57,150 --> 02:34:02,150
This tied to this chair with
this box over his dick with,

2767
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:03,011
by the way,

2768
02:34:03,011 --> 02:34:06,850
the red lights flashing like crazy now
cause because we control the red light,

2769
02:34:06,851 --> 02:34:10,240
it wasn't really when you're in Florida,
so the lights, everyone's going,

2770
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:14,380
Oh and here's a Dick Right in front of
his face and this crazy bitch that he had

2771
02:34:14,381 --> 02:34:17,590
just sucked. Whipped
cream offered tits. Yeah.

2772
02:34:17,650 --> 02:34:20,050
And now she's got this cock in
front of them. Yeah. By the way,

2773
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:22,990
they had no problem with that.
Comedy central had no problem with that.

2774
02:34:22,991 --> 02:34:24,460
But they did have a problem with hard.

2775
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:28,420
The reason why that sign is here is
because we had to use another sign because

2776
02:34:28,421 --> 02:34:31,630
he couldn't be make me hard cause making
me hard was they wanted to make me

2777
02:34:31,631 --> 02:34:34,630
stiff. Right. That's what they said.
That was one of the things they argue.

2778
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,220
Those are arbitrary things that they,

2779
02:34:36,221 --> 02:34:39,460
standards and practices guys like decide
on Sunday the standards and practices.

2780
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:43,150
It's the fucking, it's the network and
the advertisers. It's not even that.

2781
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:45,940
It's just a bunch of dummies who want
to have their say on things. Right.

2782
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:48,520
And that's why doing something on
the Internet, it's so beautiful.

2783
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:51,850
Like if we had one of those
same executives in this
room and we were talking

2784
02:34:51,851 --> 02:34:53,950
about things, they would probably
tell us not to talk about it, right.

2785
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:55,390
They would tell us a change of subject.

2786
02:34:55,870 --> 02:34:58,990
If someone had a sit down with us and
give us like a list of shit that we

2787
02:34:58,991 --> 02:35:01,300
couldn't take.
Personal responsibility.

2788
02:35:01,301 --> 02:35:04,900
It gives you your own sovereignty and
it's what all human beings want and should

2789
02:35:04,901 --> 02:35:09,100
have. If I don't pee right now, I'm
going to die. Don't die. Silver,

A lot of people think that I hate vegans.

2831
02:37:24,140 --> 02:37:27,650
I do not. Absolutely. And
I eat a lot of vegetables.
