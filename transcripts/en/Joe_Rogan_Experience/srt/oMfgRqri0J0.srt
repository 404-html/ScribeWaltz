1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,051
Try my day.

2
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:03,720
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,680
Oh yeah.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,820
But the kitchen like him more to
measure the opponent of the bay and then

5
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,460
suddenly his his hand.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,393
So

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,140
he's the guy,

8
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:19,501
man.

9
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,210
He's one of my favorite guys to watch.

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,370
Also be outside of fighting

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,770
the way he talks.

12
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,270
He never has the same like with me,

13
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:27,871
but the interviews,

14
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,190
when people ask you know about your life,

15
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:30,024
how it started?

16
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,521
Well it,

17
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:30,771
it's,

18
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,550
it's the same story over and over again.

19
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:32,870
Well he,

20
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,450
he can,

21
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,510
he can make it every time.

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,320
He's one of those guys
have constantly changes.

23
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,580
Smart businessman.

24
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,350
Yeah.

25
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,930
Oh,

26
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,410
smart.

27
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,040
Smartest.

28
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,890
He's the best shit talker and
the history of combat sports.

29
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,070
Before that it was like chill son and,

30
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:48,180
and Muhammad Ali and now
it's kind of aggressive.

31
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,340
He just knows how to fucking say it.

32
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,820
Jeremy Stevens starts talking and he goes,

33
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,070
the guy just destroyed
them with one sentence.

34
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,190
He's,

35
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,950
he finds the perfect shit.

36
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,570
The way he looked back.

37
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,920
It's hilarious.

38
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,750
I mean when he went in there and
I related Eddie Alvarez like that,

39
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,613
you just kind of go,

40
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,400
Ooh,

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,233
fuck you man.

42
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,660
Yup.

43
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,800
He's any of that style of
sliding out and sliding in.

44
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:20,820
It's a very unusual,

45
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,440
almost a karate based style.

46
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,080
Yep.

47
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,910
And I went to like sitting down on
vicious punches on the end of it,

48
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,420
you know,

49
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,681
but he,

50
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:27,930
you know,

51
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,820
his stamps and because
she's just softball.

52
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:30,141
But I,

53
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:30,691
I thought,

54
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:30,871
you know,

55
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,080
with,

56
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,950
with the Aldo,

57
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,500
if I was all those coach
a year ago already,

58
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:39,060
I would have said we got to tray South
Pole and go because there's no way he can

59
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:39,990
block those low kicks,

60
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,070
his left low kicks Gump.

61
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:44,430
There's no way he can block them because
his stance is too white and his knees

62
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:45,880
are pointing inside to the shadow.

63
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,320
The chem 100% of that is the
whole game changes the whole game.

64
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,050
And his left low kicked by the way,

65
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,381
look,

66
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:57,180
although could kick the fuck out of you
with either low low kicks her right.

67
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:58,014
Wow Man.

68
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,030
Yeah,

69
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,381
he's a,

70
00:01:59,381 --> 00:01:59,560
he,

71
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,140
he always made me think it for
Ramon Dekkers that explosive.

72
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,711
Oh Man.

73
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:05,380
His law will,

74
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,820
they'd call the Duchy left to the body
and then right leg kick behind it.

75
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,131
Chad Mendez.

76
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,461
I was like,

77
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,460
Woo though.

78
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,460
He throws it man.

79
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,320
I think Aldo and Max Holloway
a very interesting fight.

80
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,660
It has to happen.

81
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:25,080
I keep hearing all this crazy shit like
all my go up and fight a bead for the

82
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:26,910
interim title and I'm like,

83
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:27,601
God damn it.

84
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:28,600
You got to have money.

85
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,700
Why don't I,

86
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,740
well there we go again.

87
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:31,981
Right.

88
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:35,770
The money wait fights everyone
already even that talked about

89
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,370
away instead of staying in their
way instead of defending the title,

90
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:42,204
they old.

91
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,070
It's obviously not as big a fight.

92
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:46,150
Is Him Fighting Nemo Grumet
off in Russia though,

93
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,003
right?

94
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,860
Especially if they fight
for a 55 pound title.

95
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,720
If nerveracking Madoff fights in Russia,

96
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,970
they might have to fucking
build a new soccer state yet.

97
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't think people understand.

98
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,650
Anytime I post something on Instagram,

99
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:03,170
I get 150 fucking Russian dudes who write
Habib time and then they just pulled a

100
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:04,140
beep time and the credits,

101
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,780
what fucking credits are overrun with
people that say or a not credits,

102
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,630
comments rather overrun with people.

103
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,461
Say Habib time.

104
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:13,960
Habib Tom [inaudible] fucking just for
safety when they're building that thing.

105
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:18,961
Make an underground tunnel when he loses
Kop we straight to the airport sites.

106
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,023
Connor,

107
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,670
you know what's interesting about the
Conor fight man lock Habib Time Habib Tom

108
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,700
See?

109
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:25,981
Oh yeah,

110
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:26,200
yeah.

111
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
He's not fucking around.

112
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:27,994
It's all true.

113
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,051
But like,

114
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:29,470
um,

115
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,670
if he fights Connor,

116
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:30,971
we,

117
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,340
Michael Johnson cracked
him and rocked him.

118
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:33,670
I went,

119
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,250
oh boy.

120
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,193
Did he get it?

121
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,481
He did get angry.

122
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,710
He beat the fuck out of them yet.

123
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,430
But the point is he got hurt.

124
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:40,960
He got hurt.

125
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,700
And if Connor catches you like that,

126
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,470
you might be fucking Donesville.

127
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,890
Yup.

128
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,160
He might drop some hammers on you
and that might be the same thing,

129
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,710
right.

130
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,430
The uh,

131
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,931
you know,

132
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,470
we seen caught or as
well at times it's just,

133
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,281
well,

134
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:53,630
Ben,

135
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,540
Ben Shahn Habib's defense,

136
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,230
we saw Conor get rocked against Nate
and he wound up losing that fight.

137
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,100
Shortly thereafter.

138
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,470
Habib got rocked and it's
Michael Johnson back.

139
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:03,940
Came back stronger.

140
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:04,270
Yeah.

141
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,140
Dominated him.

142
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,550
So it was the only time,

143
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:06,851
I mean,

144
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,150
it's,

145
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,010
when you see a guy who
his dominant is a B,

146
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
you start looking for
weaknesses in his arm.

147
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:12,490
It's the only time we've
seen any weakness at all.

148
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:12,770
Yeah.

149
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,490
But Mcgregor to,

150
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,261
in his defense,

151
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,640
he was getting tired already there.

152
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,503
You're ready?

153
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,400
Yup.

154
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,760
Yup,

155
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,000
Yup.

156
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,230
Sure.

157
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:19,501
That'd be,

158
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,211
it doesn't get tired.

159
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,044
Yeah.

160
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:29,990
Okay.
