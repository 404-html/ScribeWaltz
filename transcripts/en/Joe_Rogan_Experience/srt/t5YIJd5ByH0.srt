1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:03,670
base.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,503
Talk about this.

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,490
I can talk about this.

5
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:05,960
Absolutely.

6
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,720
Okay.

7
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,310
I think I can other smooshy there.

8
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,510
I mean if you want to go,

9
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,810
if you want to back things up there,

10
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:11,191
man,

11
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:12,570
how fucked is that picture?

12
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,600
That picture's Walrus is sitting
on a concrete floor with,

13
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,570
with her arm through.

14
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,230
It's a her right with her arm
through a fucking prison cage.

15
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,610
That's so dark,

16
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:24,150
man.

17
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,960
So the story of smooshy is,

18
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,590
you know,

19
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,210
she come in from like wild
caught 18 months of age,

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,901
200 pounds.

21
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:31,734
He's this big,

22
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,820
he's a big pillow.

23
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,653
Beautiful Amy.

24
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,553
She's a baby.

25
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,980
She's not,

26
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,640
she didn't come in alone.

27
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,870
She comes up with some other animals,

28
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,590
uh,

29
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,360
walruses where they catch them,

30
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,130
Russia and the Black Sea.

31
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,990
So she comes in and we start then
now we got to get blood from him.

32
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,280
We got to see if these
animals are healthy.

33
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,400
So the way you do it
with an untrained animal,

34
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,600
you throw a big net on him,

35
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,530
physically jumped,

36
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,453
grabbed them.

37
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,640
The fet sticks a needle in their vet or
train or someone and they go to take the

38
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,474
blood out.

39
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,920
Well during this procedure,

40
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,560
there was another walrus there that
we were doing the procedure on.

41
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,330
And here's smooshy who's,

42
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,553
you know,

43
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,090
climbing up on the other walrus.

44
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,830
Let's make things very difficult.

45
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:08,130
He Mat,

46
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,880
as you can imagine,

47
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,590
these guys are like linebackers.

48
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,300
So all I do is I put my hands in front
of her face like this and she opened up

49
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,051
her nostrils and,

50
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:16,710
and I,

51
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,670
I remember this vividly,

52
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,310
she took a big breath.

53
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,860
She started to follow me.

54
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:23,191
After that,

55
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:24,180
I started to backup.

56
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,140
This animal followed me,

57
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,040
big eyes staring at me,

58
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,933
following me.

59
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,010
I'd never seen anything like this before.

60
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:29,844
I thought it was like,

61
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,100
this is going to be just a onetime thing.

62
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,110
She just followed me because
this just made her nervous.

63
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,850
What had happened at 18 months of age
and at that specific time was I had

64
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,780
imprinted on her.

65
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,490
That's what happens in the wild.

66
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,721
You're a mother,

67
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,290
Walrus,

68
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,410
you shit out a calf that animal's
going to tattoo to its brain,

69
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,520
your smell,

70
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,353
your sight,

71
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,373
the sound,

72
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,780
everything so that you
can be identified in,

73
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,500
you know,

74
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,400
heard of hundreds.

75
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,380
This happened at 18 months of phases.

76
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,210
So she imprinted on you.

77
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,044
Just maybe she was her,

78
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,170
you imprinted on her
because she was panicking.

79
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,470
I think it has to have been,

80
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,450
it was at that moment,

81
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:03,960
and no question because
I know it's the baby.

82
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:05,370
While this was all going down,

83
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,030
and you can imagine the stress of
being caught only maybe months before

84
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,220
separated from your mother or
witnessing her mother die in a harvest.

85
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,040
Jesus Christ.

86
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,970
So this happened.

87
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,980
So this animal I imprinted on her.

88
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,240
Well this is,

89
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,170
this is an anomaly.

90
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,160
This doesn't happen.

91
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,970
This isn't,

92
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,151
hey,

93
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:21,984
here's food.

94
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,700
We're like best friends now.

95
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,020
Great.

96
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,480
This is your my mommy.

97
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,270
That's the relationship we have.

98
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,860
It's crazy.

99
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,550
Wow.

100
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,731
Yeah,

101
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,271
that's intense.

102
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:37,260
So then when you start factoring in the
fact that she's in the pool with a lot

103
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:42,261
of crazy chlorine values and she's getting
chemical burns and everything else,

104
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,674
and I'm like,

105
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,260
so you almost have a,

106
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:48,420
a paternal relationship with this?

107
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,440
Definitely have.

108
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,090
I definitely have a paternal hours.

109
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,523
Wow.

110
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,150
That's crazy.

111
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,580
And all because of the fact
they're not cleaning the water.

112
00:02:56,581 --> 00:03:00,200
She's getting sick while there's
more to it than that point.

113
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,720
She come in at 2004,

114
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,340
so she's probably 10,

115
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,540
a little over 10 years old now.

116
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,913
Um,

117
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,820
this relationship also turned into,

118
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,800
created some problems.

119
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,480
It manifested in like,

120
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,260
you know,

121
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,060
physical manifestations of stress.

122
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,060
She developed this uncontrollable
regurgitating issue where
she doesn't keep her

123
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:21,881
fish down,

124
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,890
she pukes it up and it's from anxiety,

125
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,690
from separation anxiety because I'm fast
forwarding a bit from that moment of

126
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,480
the imprint to now or well
to prior to now of course.

127
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,500
So there was,

128
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,010
there was a lot of challenges
that that relationship post.

129
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,870
So you try to train well,

130
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,880
so I developed this,

131
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,040
this system where the animal consumes
fish and thereafter consumed Jello.

132
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,800
I would teach her to eat the
Gel and play with the Jello.

133
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,380
So try to keep her from throwing up the,

134
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:52,480
the nutrients that are keeping her
from gaining weight and being healthy.

135
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,314
Right.

136
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,050
So I tried to train all
the other people on this,

137
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,411
you know,

138
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,480
tried to wean myself
out a number of times.

139
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:59,590
But again,

140
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,200
so the relationship was a
blessing in the fact that this is,

141
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,340
this is amazing,

142
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,150
this is crazy.

143
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,140
And it was also an,

144
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,730
and more so now like an absolute curse
because giving a shit about an animal in

145
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,440
that at that level,

146
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,041
like what you're saying,

147
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,770
that the parental relationship,

148
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,604
that bond,

149
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,321
that's tough,

150
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,010
man.

151
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,440
Like to see what she's going through
and then you start realizing like,

152
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,330
I dunno what I can do.

153
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,670
Yeah.

154
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,680
To save her because she's going to die.

155
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,620
Okay.

156
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,453
Wow.

157
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:37,920
Yeah.
