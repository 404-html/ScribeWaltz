1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
I get the comedy store,
never cashed the checks.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,180
So how'd you get into comedy?
We are alive.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,210
We'll answer bad childhood.
Everybody's freelance.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,700
If you didn't get into that for that 
reason,

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:13,170
you probably have a shitty act.
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,600
That is so true.
Because it lets you,

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,660
it lets you weren't seen as a child or 
heard as a child and have this 

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,650
insatiable need to be seen and heard and
understood.

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,690
It's definitely a deficit.
You can't be funny.

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,640
Dude.
What the fuck were you doing in Vietnam?

11
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:31,641
Because this is one of the reasons I 
didn't want to talk to you about this 

12
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:31,641
before that I didn't want to see you 
before this.

13
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,810
I just wanted to get you in and I'm glad
we didn't talk about it before,

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,080
but I went to your instagram page and I 
saw these pictures of you working with 

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,251
these children that have cleft palates 
and I saw these photos of you in 

16
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:43,590
Vietnam.
So tell me what are you doing?

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,850
Um,
so there's this charity called Operation

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,850
Smile and I'm usually working in animal 
charities because people I think are 

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,380
usually the problem.
And I had been helping people just seems

20
00:00:55,381 --> 00:01:00,210
to make more proliferate and uh,
and in terms of charity stuff,

21
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:04,210
like I think that just why I started 
wanting to get more involved as like,

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,890
I'm going to be perfectly honest,
I started not liking the person that I 

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,800
was.
I started realizing I was the person who

24
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,750
was like,
God traffic.

25
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,900
It's like crazy today.
Like,

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,960
oh my God,
starbucks is out of soy milk with the 

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:20,960
puck.
Like I was just like,

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:20,960
whoa.

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,030
That is jus.
What did,

30
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,110
what,
what made you feel like you were going 

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,110
to a place that you didn't like or 
becoming a person in life?

32
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,310
I think it's like,
um,

33
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,670
you know,
doing like working with animals and 

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,670
like,
you know,

35
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,670
going to sort of,
um,

36
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,370
parts of town that I wouldn't normally 
go to to rescue animals and dogs.

37
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:38,990
You start going like,
oh,

38
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,350
there's a real world outside this.
Truman show that we live in of the fake 

39
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,150
sets and the fake this and the fake 
people and the fake,

40
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,660
you know,
makeup and the fake close every.

41
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,050
And I was just like,
oh,

42
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:54,990
like that.
I live in a fun house,

43
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,900
you know,
sometimes when you're in this business,

44
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,460
I mean,
stand up keeps me,

45
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,650
you know,
a real person because TV shows that get 

46
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:03,650
you.
I think it's TV shows,

47
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,781
I think it's writing fake scripts about 
fake people and fake lots and fake 

48
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:08,210
houses and you know,
fake edit bays.

49
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,940
And uh,
I just was like really?

50
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:15,320
I'm concerned about and knowing,
you know,

51
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:20,321
way more than I do,
but then what I do know about neurology 

52
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,110
is that our brains acclimate to whatever
environment we're in.

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,990
And I was like,
I'm in this environment all the time.

54
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,420
My brain is just going to start 
acclimating accordingly.

55
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:27,260
Right.
So it's like,

56
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,640
you know,
I find it a little ways,

57
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:29,570
like,
you know,

58
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,650
if I,
uh,

59
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,980
if I have a small purse,
I only need a small purse.

60
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,040
If I were a big purse,
all of a sudden I filled it up with 

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,040
shit,
you know,

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,750
it's like you kind of acclimate to what 
you have a.

63
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,120
and so I was like,
um,

64
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,960
yeah,
I don't,

65
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,670
I don't like the things that come out of
my mouth.

66
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:46,250
I don't like my inner monologue.
I don't like the fact that I get annoyed

67
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,810
when,
uh,

68
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,400
you know,
my uber is,

69
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,770
you know,
not on fucking time.

70
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,910
Like I just,
I was like,

71
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:57,911
so I kind of wanted to get some 
perspective and like really get out 

72
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:58,310
there and not just like giving money for
my own selfish,

73
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,700
like guilt,
like I'm just going to give money.

74
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,160
And so I went to Vietnam for two weeks 
and did this.

75
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:11,161
Um,
I went to Tokyo for a couple of days 

76
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:11,161
before then,
which was actually really interesting.

77
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:11,820
Uh,
and uh,

78
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,320
when I got to,
you know,

79
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,480
wash the surgeries and uh,
it was also cool because I don't know if

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,730
you are at this ever went through this,
but um,

81
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,870
I think I got sick of myself.
Like I just kind of was like,

82
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,050
I'm sick of my voice.
I'm sick of my making jokes.

83
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,350
I'm sick of being funny.
I'm sick of like.

84
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,200
And uh,
there's something about being around 

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,890
people that don't speak English,
that kind of strips you of your persona,

86
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,930
you know,
of your,

87
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,840
all the things that you.
Just because some.

88
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,300
I mean,
I,

89
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:48,301
I just,
I don't want to go through life like a 

90
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:50,810
sleep walking Zombie who's just like 
doing a bad impression on myself every 

91
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,270
day because it's so easy to do and I 
find,

92
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,670
I felt like life was a little bit 
groundhog day bud,

93
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:55,780
get up,
workout jokes,

94
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:56,350
jokes,
jokes,

95
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:56,920
jokes,
bits,

96
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,670
bits,
bits,

97
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,740
you know,
insecure,

98
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,470
insecure,
you know,

99
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,090
and I got a little bit sick of that 
rhythm and I was like,

100
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:07,720
there's gotta be something more deeper 
and uh,

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,780
you know,
were seekers and I was like thinking 

102
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:12,780
about my next special and the next thing
I'm going to write.

103
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:12,780
And I was like,
I don't want to just.

104
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,820
And I felt like my brain was,
had this,

105
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,920
there was like patterns and rhythms that
I was like,

106
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:22,120
I keep going to the same place for 
creatively.

107
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:27,121
And I was like,
I want to go to a different place 

108
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:28,531
entirely.
So I got to like challenge my brain and 

109
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:28,531
throw some new shit at it.
Um,

110
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:30,370
and being around people that don't speak
English is really,

111
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,330
first of all have no idea who you are,
which is another experience when you're 

112
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,811
used to people knowing who you are and 
having expectations of you and thinking 

113
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,940
you're going to be funny or you know,
when you're known,

114
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,870
all of a sudden you have the power 
whether you wanted or not in a room,

115
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,060
you know,
you walk into a room and you have the 

116
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,060
power whether you're interested in 
having it or not,

117
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,060
you just do,
right?

118
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,580
Joe Rogan walks in,
everyone's like,

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,180
be cool and everyone's trying to impress
you.

120
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,740
Everybody changes,
right?

121
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:01,741
So you never get to see people's 
authentic self because you inherently 

122
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,610
affect them with your presence.
You know,

123
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,010
there's some,
I can't remember the,

124
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:10,011
a term in science where it's impossible 
to measure the thing because the 

125
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,870
measuring tool affects the amount.
Is that.

126
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah,
exactly.

127
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:18,601
So you never know how people really are 
because your presence actually affects 

128
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,150
them.
But if they've never heard of you,

129
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,780
which in Vietnam known for me,
not a lot of fans over there.

130
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,890
And,
uh,

131
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,810
so you're just like,
you know,

132
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,650
you can't rely on any of that shit that 
we've become used to relying on.

133
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Um,
and talking to people that don't speak 

134
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:34,740
English,
all of a sudden you're like,

135
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,540
oh,
I can't use all my goto strategies,

136
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,160
charm,
manipulation,

137
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,170
jokes,
like no one cares.

138
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,780
Um,
and so it was really pretty,

139
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,060
pretty cool.
Um,

140
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,810
Vietnam in general,
we'll talk about,

141
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:50,080
I'm sure you have your thoughts on Asia.
I'm mine,

142
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:53,960
I think are kind of probably going to be
polarizing and get me in trouble because

143
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,120
I think it's a fucking mess over there.

144
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,540
But there's also,
I think that when,

145
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,650
you know,
I mean,

146
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:05,651
you have kids,
you have more of a insight into what's 

147
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:06,440
real and what's not.
Like.

148
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,710
I also noticed that when,
um,

149
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,870
both of my parents had strokes,
which was awful obviously,

150
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,170
but I liked the person I became after it
happened.

151
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,410
Like I was like,
all of a sudden when something tragic 

152
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:20,410
happens to you,
things become clear.

153
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,801
Your priorities become clear.
If someone asks you to go to lodge that 

154
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:23,801
you don't want to hang out with,
you said,

155
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,100
no,
you're not like,

156
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,240
sure.
I guess I'll switch.

157
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,970
Like you're just.
Everything becomes very black and white.

158
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,960
Do I want to do this?
Do I not?

159
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:31,850
Is this an effective use of my time?
It's just not.

160
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,620
Um,
so I was like,

161
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,630
Oh,
if I just exposed myself to a little bit

162
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,090
more,
not tragedy,

163
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:40,360
but maybe you know,
um,

164
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,380
and stop hanging out with a bunch of 
people with fake problems and hang out 

165
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,280
and surround myself with real problems.
Then maybe I'll stop thinking I have a 

166
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,280
bunch of problems I don't really have.

167
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,680
I always love talking to you because 
you're probably one of the most 

168
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,890
ruthlessly introspective people I know.
Really?

169
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

170
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,650
You don't,
you don't think you are,

171
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,170
you don't see,
you're pretty brutally introspective.

172
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,000
I just,
I thank you.

173
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,280
I just,
um,

174
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,160
I don't want to be as somby.
I don't.

175
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:09,790
Most people are just sleepwalking 
through life and uh,

176
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,570
that does not happen.

177
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,720
Yes ma'am.
Do you have,

178
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,670
you had very many psychedelic 
experiences.

179
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,810
You know,
what I have

180
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,010
event and I was going to do Iowasca last
year,

181
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:20,830
but I had been on antidepressants and 
yeah,

182
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,430
and I only went on them.
It's such a bummer and I'm actually want

183
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:27,190
to talk about this in my next special 
because they were,

184
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,530
they were given to me because I was 
having trouble sleeping.

185
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,530
I had insomnia,
which I recently learned about how 

186
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:35,530
insomnia it sort of came about and it's 
actually really important.

187
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,710
Um,
and I wish that there were doctors out 

188
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,710
there who studied shit like that,
like insomnia.

189
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,480
Usually people are insomniacs fucking 
thousands of years ago,

190
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,590
people in the tribes,
like tribal life before streetlights and

191
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:52,591
alarm systems.
There were people who were responsible 

192
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:52,591
for staying up all.
Everybody else slept.

193
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:56,761
They were like,
they called the night watchers 

194
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,500
basically.
And nightwatch would breed with night 

195
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:58,780
watchers and s essentially.

196
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,580
So you're a nightwatchman.
I could be,

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,190
that could be my.
Because you know,

198
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:08,191
there's some people who are like,
I just can't fall asleep till three in 

199
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,191
the morning.
I know who never says that.

200
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,760
Who Farmers was never say that actually 
fucking work true.

201
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,860
Do to dig holes all day today.
I know the most I'd employed people.

202
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,420
They're like,
oh,

203
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,430
I cannot sleep.
It's again because you haven't done 

204
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:20,430
shit.
Fucking well.

205
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,890
Yeah.
You have three kids,

206
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:21,960
right?

207
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,440
I feel like my insomnia is going to go 
write something there.

208
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,310
I feel like as soon as I have kids or 
something,

209
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:26,650
mine's off.

210
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,260
It'll probably still stay there.
Really?

211
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,430
Oh,
I guess I'll be a mother so I'll never 

212
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,430
sleep the.
That's an issue,

213
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,580
but it's also a mental loop thing.
Like if you go to bed and you have a 

214
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:37,580
mental loop,
like,

215
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,610
oh,
I gotta get this.

216
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:40,890
I gotTa fucking get my shit together.
I really have to do this.

217
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:43,380
I really got to start this diet and 
really going to start a journal.

218
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,710
There's a book that I need to write.
I know I need to write it.

219
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,730
I need to fucking start.
Should I get out of bed right now and 

220
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:50,730
start writing it and then that loop will
fuck with you and keep you up.

221
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,520
Especially someone like you who's so 
hyper ambitious,

222
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:56,220
you always have like 15 irons in the 
fire

223
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,110
and you've got a fucking fireplace,
bellows.

224
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,610
You're stoking and you're on the phone 
at the same time.

225
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:01,950
Yeah,
yeah,

226
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,340
yeah,
yeah,

227
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,060
yeah.
We'll do that.

228
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:06,720
We'll definitely do that.
We've almost got like too many points of

229
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:11,280
focus where I imagine that your brain 
getting down to a neutral point,

230
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,590
it probably has a very difficult time.
Yeah,

231
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,910
and I've also done a couple things,
but also our brains are not designed to 

232
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,731
see the amount of light that we see.
Like we're like the screens and our 

233
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,180
phones,
like our brain produces cortisol.

234
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:24,870
When they see it,
it's like,

235
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:29,871
wake up.
Our brain thinks our phone is the sun 

236
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:29,871
basically.
Wake up.

237
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:32,370
Have you seen the new feature on iphones
were turns it down at 10:00

238
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,000
PM?
You could set it.

239
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,790
No,
but mine is now in black and white.

240
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Oh Shit.
Just going back to go back to the phone.

241
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,770
Black and white fucking typewriter.
If someone sends you a picture,

242
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,250
then it's,
you know,

243
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,870
it's gonna be very hard to see.
How did you give her your phone?

244
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,770
I've turned a black and white because 
you do that.

245
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,650
I didn't even know that was a of 
settings.

246
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,290
Yeah,
because the colors in your phone,

247
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,590
a trigger,
a bunch of chemicals to be released in 

248
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,590
your brain that actually activate you 
and entered entered.

249
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,660
So ironic.
You have a flower as your backdrop.

250
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,090
Flower,
black and white.

251
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,570
See what the fuck George O'keeffe.
I mean our big.

252
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,430
Yeah.
That.

253
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,740
Yeah,
that's a really.

254
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,410
That's an octopus vagina actually that 
flower.

255
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,530
But yeah,
I'm super into a like,

256
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,620
you know,
just if you understand how the brain 

257
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:27,620
works,
you can usually hack,

258
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,360
get a little bit.
So it's like when you look at your 

259
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,360
phone.
So my phone,

260
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,360
I actually,
I used to be so addicted to it.

261
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,640
Now I just have no interest in it 
because it's black and white.

262
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,740
It's just like,
it's not giving me the dopamine and the 

263
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:37,740
chemicals that you know.
Really?

264
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Yeah.
Color.

265
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,670
What color?
Turning your phone black and white makes

266
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:43,830
it less attractive to you?
Less addictive.

267
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,840
Whoa.
Yes,

268
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,170
because I'm like phone,
phone,

269
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,790
and a lot of it is just the color,
so it's just like,

270
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,360
oh,
cortisol.

271
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,400
Adrenaline read produces adrenaline and 
cortisol,

272
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,630
dopamine,
and then I'm just like,

273
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,800
no.
I'm just like,

274
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,430
ugh.
It's so.

275
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,940
What is the setting?
How have you changed?

276
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,700
You go to.
I'll tell you.

277
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,890
Hold on.
I'll never do it.

278
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,270
By the way.
Why not try it?

279
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Try it for a day because I'll have a 
little thing called discipline didn't 

280
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,240
see.
I just want to have sex with that now.

281
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,180
I can't do it.
Can't do it.

282
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,940
Listen,
it's not easy and I've learned how to do

283
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:15,150
it.

284
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,460
I've learned how to do it so.
But I've rules that might not be your.

285
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,480
What gives you dope?
Me.

286
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,130
Oh No,
it is.

287
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,010
No,
look,

288
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:28,011
I could sit down there.
I get up in the morning and take a shit 

289
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:28,011
and I'll look at that thing for fucking 
three hours.

290
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,120
What are you looking at?
Reading?

291
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,710
I'm reading articles that I don't need 
to read.

292
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,980
I'm fucking just becomes like a cancer,
but what I do now is if I do it,

293
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,300
I look at the important stuff.
I'll go over,

294
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,190
do I have any work emails that are 
pertinent to check my work?

295
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:47,930
Email?
Yeah.

296
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,090
There's nothing to deal with.
Do I have any text messages that are 

297
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,740
other I need to deal with?
Nothing to deal with.

298
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:53,950
Yeah.

299
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,510
Shut it off,
put it away,

300
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,640
walk away.
You and I though might have a different 

301
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,250
idea of what I need to deal with them,
but I doubt I sometimes,

302
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,290
you know,
get sucked into stuff that's completely 

303
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:06,290
unnecessary and frivolous.
That's also an addiction.

304
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,300
I'm texting about a fucking baby shower 
that I'm not even going to and I'm just 

305
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,300
like,
what am I doing?

306
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,660
You know,
I'm difficult to get ahold of your,

307
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,160
but you're very self contained.
I'm a little more and I'm in recovery.

308
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:21,161
We talked about it for codependent,
so I sometimes struggle with the 

309
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:21,750
discomfort or perceived as comfort of 
others,

310
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:23,840
so I feel like I need to take care of 
people's feelings sometimes.

311
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,330
So it's harder a caretaker and a lot of 
ways.

312
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:29,600
That's why you love dogs,
dogs and dogs.

313
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,340
Only the voiceless.
Only people.

314
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,960
Only like people that are can't help 
themselves.

315
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,320
If you can help yourself and you didn't,
that's not my problem.

316
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,390
I've learned over the years that I only 
have a certain amount of,

317
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,420
not just time,
but a certain amount of focus and that 

318
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,920
the less focused I give two things that 
I'm not really interested in,

319
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,320
the more focused I'll have for things 
that I am interested in.

320
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:58,321
Yeah.
It's like a real issue with my manager 

321
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:58,840
because I just fucking vanish for days.
I don't answer phone calls.

322
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,090
Jamie,
I just got the same thing.

323
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:07,091
I had the same thing just happened with 
a manager who hadn't heard from me 

324
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:07,091
because I went to Vietnam and I got back
and I was just like.

325
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:12,070
I recently learned that when someone 
calls or texts you don't have to 

326
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,410
respond.
Like I,

327
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,440
you know,
I think we get in this obligatory sort 

328
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,141
of thing.
We have to respond to everything and it 

329
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:20,750
was actually interesting going to Japan 
because that culture is,

330
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:25,751
so.
I'm using this word probably a 

331
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,620
inappropriately,
but for lack of a better word,

332
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:32,650
codependent,
it's so like having to take care of 

333
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,561
everybody's feelings.
Like I was talking to this guy on a 

334
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,571
plane.
There's so much respect for other 

335
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:37,571
people's feelings and status.
I went,

336
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:42,160
I'm on the plane on the way over.
I sat next to the super interesting guy 

337
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,041
who creates a tools for animators,
like I know like the stuff that makes 

338
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,800
cartoons,
like I,

339
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:52,801
I can't even,
I don't even have the vernacular to 

340
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:52,801
explain it.

341
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:52,801
Um,
but he said it's really hard to do focus

342
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:53,960
groups in Japan,
you know,

343
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:55,340
focus groups is when you go around and 
say,

344
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:56,580
is this working?
Is this not working?

345
00:13:56,581 --> 00:14:01,581
Right?
Because no one will respond until an 

346
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:02,360
elder response and everyone just agrees 
with the elder.

347
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,150
You're not allowed to disagree with 
someone older than you.

348
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,800
Uh,
which was,

349
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,780
uh,
there was an article about the,

350
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,950
um,
a lot of the,

351
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,480
I think it was a couple Malaysian 
airline flights that went down.

352
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,490
They say it was pilot error because the 
copilot was afraid to disagree with the 

353
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,760
pilot.
The pilot was wrong,

354
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,810
but because of the inherent respect for 
your elders thing,

355
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,800
he couldn't say like,
dude,

356
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,240
we're going to crash if you can do that.
And the plane went down.

357
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
So it's so interesting.
And I came back and I was like,

358
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:33,620
Oh God,
at least I'm not.

359
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,830
And I mean in,
I mean I think I was a little bit 

360
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:38,930
horrified,
horrified,

361
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,220
not a good word,
the right word.

362
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:43,700
Saddened by this culture of like,
shame over there.

363
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,730
We have it in different ways,
but it's like if you disgrace your 

364
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,490
family,
you just jump off a building.

365
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,470
I mean it's just.
And

366
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,010
there's so many people were jumping in 
front of trains that the only way they 

367
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,731
could get them to stop jumping in front 
of trains when they shame their family 

368
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:04,340
was saying if people jump in front of 
trains,

369
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,130
we're going to bill your family for the 
cleanup.

370
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,010
So that got them to stop because they 
were like,

371
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:15,011
well,
why don't my family to have to get this 

372
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,421
bill?
Because that will disgrace them even 

373
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:18,551
more.
So they had to use their shame against 

374
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,120
them as a way to get them to stop 
committing suicide.

375
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,620
I mean,
apple in China,

376
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,710
apple had to put nets around the 
building.

377
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,310
So many people were jumping off it.
Well that's a real issue in and unto 

378
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,240
itself because Apple's paying these 
people and they're living in this 

379
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,540
building,
paying dog shit.

380
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,820
I mean,
they don't have these factories over in 

381
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,950
China because it's an awesome place to 
build phones.

382
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,160
They have these factories over there 
because they could pay people virtually 

383
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,100
nothing and have them work all day.
China,

384
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,650
I've been to China before just in 
general,

385
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,620
like,
and I'm,

386
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,680
and I want to come from a judging place 
because we obviously have our problems 

387
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:57,740
in the states,
but uh,

388
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,250
it was just a really.
I feel like when I went over there and 

389
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:03,250
was like,
Gosh,

390
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:03,940
you're just going to love it.
Like everyone's,

391
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,450
like,
India is amazing.

392
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:10,451
It's like it's really poor and people 
die of dysentery and yeah.

393
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,850
And there's,
you know,

394
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,940
I'm a baby girls or have their head 
smashed on rocks because of the dowery 

395
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,930
system.
I mean it's like there's,

396
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,260
you know,
I feel like there's this.

397
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,890
Yeah,
there's a documentary on I guess itunes.

398
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,920
It's about infanticide in China and 
India because the dowery system.

399
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,210
So basically to have a child is a 
fortune.

400
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:40,210
I've had time,
sorry to have a female because you have 

401
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,850
to pay someone to marry her.
She can't work at your dad's family.

402
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,590
And she's basically just like a 
financial drain,

403
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,680
um,
which is just terrifying.

404
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,710
So that goes on in China.
Still a terrifies me is that that's 

405
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,930
probably an ancient way of thinking and 
behaving.

406
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,020
So like we look at today and we look at 
this world that we live in today and 

407
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,970
obviously we have a lot of issues with 
equality and we have a lot of issues 

408
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,540
with racism.
We have a lot of issues with homophobia,

409
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:09,120
but whatever issues we have are nothing 
compared to the,

410
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:12,500
the echoes of our past.
And when you look at something like that

411
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,130
and when you know,
there are hate crimes,

412
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,220
that's an individual person against an 
individual person that's not like a 

413
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,740
socially accepted thing.
Smaller the Nazi,

414
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,120
I'm not endorsing hate crimes,
but if you know someone,

415
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,680
a beats up a gay guy,
most people think it was bad that he did

416
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:33,950
that and they go to jail.
But it's one person who's fucked up,

417
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,930
not entire country.
That's like,

418
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:36,740
yeah,
that was a good idea.

419
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,820
The last echoes,
the last reverberations that our way is 

420
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:48,251
better.
I'm not saying you guys have to become 

421
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:48,251
America,
but it was just a little bit like,

422
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:48,520
oh,
this is like,

423
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,430
well,
I like fact that they're not America.

424
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,490
I liked it.
There's all these different cultures 

425
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,291
because I think it's fascinating that 
there's different parts of the world 

426
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,601
where people have figured out a 
different way to behave and they follow 

427
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:02,501
this different pattern.
They've carved this groove and all the 

428
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:02,880
young people follow into this groove,
give or take,

429
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,570
and I think that's amazing.
I mean when you look at different parts 

430
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,271
of the world and you experienced their 
culture or you look at how they're 

431
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:14,361
behaving and how they dress and how they
speak and how they live their lives and 

432
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,170
their traditions.
It is absolutely fascinating.

433
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:19,350
These patterns of repeatable behavior to
repeating,

434
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,070
repeating patterns that exists all over 
the world and that they're so different.

435
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,410
They're different in Thailand and then 
they are in Germany.

436
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Totally different parts of the world are
associated with like having more humor 

437
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,080
or less,
more or more,

438
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,230
you know,
more discipline or more artistic 

439
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,230
freedom.
It's,

440
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,230
it's,

441
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,670
it's so and it's.
And then,

442
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,760
you know,
I mean I always forget how young of a 

443
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,700
country we are.
I mean we are a minute old compared to a

444
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:45,410
lot of these countries do you now,
so this is,

445
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:49,640
they have thousands of years of history 
that we don't have and,

446
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,090
but it's like how can you hold on to the
really cool traditions and patterns and 

447
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,430
then release the more backwards once and
evolve and grow,

448
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,480
you know,
it's like,

449
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,340
you know,
it's just wild.

450
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,760
I mean in Vietnam and it from Vietnam is
so beautiful you're going to love it.

451
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:06,590
And I was like,
yeah,

452
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:11,591
it's definitely beautiful.
But I see poverty and air that no one 

453
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:16,361
can breathe.
Everyone's wearing masks because they 

454
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:16,361
can't inhale.
There's no emissions regulations.

455
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:17,240
Everyone's on.
Like,

456
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,190
I was like,
oh right,

457
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,230
white trust fund.
Kids are like Vietnam,

458
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:26,310
beautiful.
And they say because they can come back 

459
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,310
to,
you know,

460
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,310
Williamsburg,

461
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,130
Brooklyn or whatever.
That's the thing that why people love 

462
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:30,130
talking about Brown people being 
amazing.

463
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,930
It's like look like you're not a better 
person because you think Vietnam is 

464
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,390
amazing.
Me Just admit that it's,

465
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:38,480
it's in.
We need to.

466
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,380
I mean,
I know we,

467
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,470
we fucked it up a lot of,
it's our fault of what we did in the 

468
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,470
seventies,
but it was like,

469
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,490
it was,
um,

470
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,690
gave me a lot of anxiety,
you know,

471
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:48,260
because it was like,
I mean,

472
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:49,430
it was just like the hospitals.
I mean,

473
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:54,431
we were in a hospital and you know,
we needed four of this machine that puts

474
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:59,741
babies to sleep.
Pediatric anesthesia is very different 

475
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,730
than regular anesthesia and it's 
essentially bringing people to the brink

476
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:06,731
of death and then bringing them back.
It's like incredibly fascinating a job.

477
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,430
And they had one of the machines that 
they need the pediatric 

478
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,030
anesthesiologist,
like we need four and they're like,

479
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,120
we don't have,
we just don't have them in this country.

480
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,150
We just can't do surgery on babies.
It's just not in our purview.

481
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:25,430
It's not own our,
you know,

482
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:26,600
so.
So back to,

483
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,740
to the,
you know,

484
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:30,650
the kids come in with cleft palates and 
cleft lips,

485
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,860
which the baby is essentially,
they have trouble breastfeeding.

486
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,960
It's um,
and cleft palates just,

487
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:40,961
you know,
just kind of this opening here in a 

488
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:41,810
separation as a malnutrition in the 
womb.

489
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,280
It's,
yep,

490
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,550
exposure to genetics,
uh,

491
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,570
exposure to pollution.
I'm sure all that napalm we dropped in 

492
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,620
the seventies didn't really help.
Uh,

493
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,430
but yeah,
and in America it still happens,

494
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:56,290
but it's handled right away.
It's handled.

495
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,210
It comes out three months later.
It's fixed,

496
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,910
no big deal over there.
Sometimes it's never fixed.

497
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:05,911
And when you see adults,
you see men that are 50 come in with 

498
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:08,670
giant,
giant cleft lips and palates and 

499
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,821
they've.
And it's even worse in third world 

500
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:14,101
countries,
especially African countries because 

501
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:14,101
there's such a stigma attached to it.

502
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:14,270
Not only is it,
you know,

503
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,770
in our brains to go,
like he's different than me and 

504
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,960
ostracized or stigmatized someone,
but I'm a lot of more religious 

505
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,340
countries.
Think you're the devil or your,

506
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,680
you know,
you can't get a job.

507
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,250
You're completely sequestered.
You're thrown out of your family.

508
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:31,450
And you know,
and I think,

509
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:34,370
and this is gonna sound Super Corny.
Um,

510
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,620
but I guess for me,
I,

511
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,640
I connected so much to maybe it's 
because we're comedians.

512
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:41,290
I was like,
look,

513
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,510
life,
if you.

514
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,100
It's one thing to grow up in a third 
world country.

515
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:46,750
It's another thing to deal with poverty 
and stress,

516
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,260
but if you can't smile like the basic,
the only real medicine we have,

517
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,330
you know,
everybody has universal medicine of like

518
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:57,660
laughing and smiling.
That's how we connect to people.

519
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:58,480
It's,
I mean,

520
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,200
that's fucked.
Like that was frustrating and uh,

521
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:07,201
it's so easy to fix.
That's the other thing that's 

522
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:07,750
frustrating is it takes like 30 minutes.
You're Joaquin Phoenix.

523
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,400
Look at Joaquin Phoenix

524
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,570
it.
Yeah.

525
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,670
He has a cleft lip.
Think Stacy Keach.

526
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,530
Isn't it weird that Joaquin Phoenix got 
it mean he's like a

527
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,820
be genetic.
I mean,

528
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:25,821
yeah,
but also America has its history was 

529
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:25,821
fucked up.
Shit,

530
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:25,821
you know.
Um,

531
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,500
you know,
we're by no means squeaky clean.

532
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:29,780
I mean,
we're exposed to a lot of.

533
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:36,290
We are the exact Mirka Mirka.
Um,

534
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,420
uh,
you'll like this.

535
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,970
Well,
we talked,

536
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:45,130
we talked about this last time,
just sort of like how we essentially 

537
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,130
always had to drink alcohol when before 
we had pottable water,

538
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,800
people were just,
you know,

539
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,060
what people drank wine and of those 
flats they carried around to keep from 

540
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,480
getting travelers disease for water.
That's what he would call it.

541
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,970
Yeah,
so it's completely,

542
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,650
um,
so yeah,

543
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,880
what people were such assholes who were 
just hammering,

544
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:03,680
everyone was hammered.
I mean actually when you think about it,

545
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,870
it's a miracle that someone.
I mean Ford built a car,

546
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,770
like it's like as if you were sober,
you got to be like Rockefeller.

547
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,190
Like I feel like the couple people who 
were sober just basically became like 

548
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,500
the biggest sober people who drink 
coffee.

549
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,660
It literally took over the world,
uh,

550
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,220
because I mean everybody was shit faced.
Um,

551
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,630
but yeah,
so it's crazy.

552
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:28,460
I mean,
have you ever seen a surgery?

553
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,830
I love it.
I've never been in the room,

554
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:35,240
have had a bunch of surgeries,
but I've never been in the room.

555
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,850
I've had one,
two,

556
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,170
three,
two,

557
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,380
three joints.
Yeah,

558
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,220
mostly.
Mostly joints.

559
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,010
My nose were constructed.
I have had

560
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,510
my knees done.
Thank you.

561
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,760
What was in it was internal,
more like,

562
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,040
I would never know.
Externals so fucked up.

563
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:57,041
It's all broken up in here.
It's like there's all these sharp edges 

564
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,621
underneath.
His skin would break open pretty easy 

565
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:00,110
because is it cartilage on the end and 
then bone up here.

566
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,020
This is all cartilage,
this stuff is all pretty much intact,

567
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,100
but the inside of my nose that was all 
smashed and so it was all closed off.

568
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,320
I didn't have any,
any breathing out of my nose.

569
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:13,210
No till I was 39 and you're like,
yeah,

570
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,870
my whole life.
I couldn't be that in my nose.

571
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:22,871
No bullshit.
I fell down a flight of stairs when I 

572
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:22,871
was five and I broke my nose pretty bad 
when I was five.

573
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:25,880
A cement flight of stairs,
a smash my nose and get you an operation

574
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,150
smile.
Well,

575
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,530
it wasn't just my parents just like,
ah,

576
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:31,460
yeah,
he's alive.

577
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,220
I'm alone.
Like there was Dr Tripp's.

578
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,960
I broke my arm.
My Mother didn't believe me.

579
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:38,540
I had to lift it up and it was like up 
and down.

580
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,460
It was so broken and then she's like,
break dancing.

581
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,310
It's just,
you know,

582
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:47,990
back then it was just a different world.
Like people were basically like monkeys,

583
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,610
you know?
My parents were like,

584
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:50,670
monkeys,
they're like,

585
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,880
monkey have the Internet.
Don't touch that.

586
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,890
Don't touch that.
Don't understand things now.

587
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Yeah.
But I think there's a little bit of a 

588
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,500
pendulum swing to the other way of 
helicopter parents.

589
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,060
You.
There was um,

590
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:07,061
I was reading this thing about how this 
designer who's making more dangerous 

591
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:09,290
jungle gyms for kids because they've 
gotten too safe.

592
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,870
So the daughter broke her arm of jungle 
gym.

593
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,350
Yeah.
You should call this person.

594
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,770
They're not,
they're not safe.

595
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,750
Like jungle gyms are just more 
challenging or something like,

596
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,720
I don't,
I don't remember.

597
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:25,721
Like it was something about real problem
with jungle gyms is you need to 

598
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:30,010
understand what your capabilities are 
and the only way to find that out as to 

599
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,680
fall.
You're falling on these metal bars.

600
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,880
You could fucking die.
Like kids that break their arm easily.

601
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,360
Kids don't die all the time.
Or they do know they do.

602
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,960
Kids die all the time.
When you have kids,

603
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,090
you sort of pay attention to that kind 
of shit and you realize like,

604
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:49,340
oh,
kids fall on their head and die.

605
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,580
Like it happens all the time.
If you're not paying attention and the 

606
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,011
kids get,
they don't understand boundaries and 

607
00:25:57,011 --> 00:25:59,261
limitations and physical as a parent 
because I'm obsessed with this because 

608
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:01,970
I'm already like,
I'm not too close to having a

609
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,240
child.
I froze my eggs.

610
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,790
So if anyone wants to send some sperm,
Jamie,

611
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,510
now that you're getting,
now that I'm,

612
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:13,530
now that I'm learning about your,
that's why I'm asking where are you 

613
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:13,530
from?
Okay.

614
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:13,530
Where are you from?
Slovenia.

615
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,630
Indiana will come in a cup for it.
I'm really just trying to ascertain 

616
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,150
everyone's like DNA and how strong it 
is.

617
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,950
But uh,
is that um,

618
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:27,610
I'm reading.
I just read a book called the continuum 

619
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,641
concept,
which is like a parenting saying about 

620
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:29,641
like babies.
They can be held by anyone.

621
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:30,460
It doesn't have to be their mom 
necessarily,

622
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:35,461
but maybe we should always just be being
held and sort of were designed to men 

623
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:40,291
and women kind of weren't supposed to 
live together like we're supposed to 

624
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:42,961
kind of fuck.
And then you go off and then all the 

625
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:42,961
women lived together and help raise all 
the kids.

626
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:44,130
Um,
so uh,

627
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,240
uh,
so there was something interesting in 

628
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,490
that because I'm the first three years a
childhood's a,

629
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,620
I'm sorry,
a child's ability to believe in their 

630
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,911
own faculties essentially to trust other
people and to feel like they're are 

631
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:03,680
heard and seen.
Depends on how much eye contact and 

632
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:03,680
physical touch they get.
Wow.

633
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,800
Yeah.
Cause basically touching is going like 

634
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:07,800
you,
I see you,

635
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:07,800
you're here,
you know,

636
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,100
and the less touch that eye contact they
get,

637
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:13,101
the more invisible they feel and the 
date more dangerous they feel the world 

638
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:13,101
is for them.
Oh yeah.

639
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,130
And there's this great.
You'll love this.

640
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,400
I'm John Bowlby's theory of attachment.
Like when babies crawl,

641
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,700
it's the same as for noble apes is 
they'll crawl a foot and then the look 

642
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,350
back and see if dad still looking at me.
He is,

643
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,660
I'm going to call another foot.
He's still there,

644
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:27,960
right?

645
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,950
Babies turn around and check in and then
if on the fourth foot I turn around in,

646
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,380
data is looking at his phone,
I go,

647
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,610
that's as far as I can go.
And then it's dangerous after four feet,

648
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,040
that's as far as I'll go where he'll 
still be there for me.

649
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,220
So then we also are sort of world in 
comfort zone is designed based on when 

650
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:49,800
your child loses your eye contact.
So I've just been sort of learning about

651
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:54,801
that,
especially in lieu of like cell phones 

652
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:55,050
being the new alcoholism for kids.
I feel like parents

653
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,990
just on their phone while their kids are
on the playground.

654
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,750
Yeah,
it's,

655
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,970
it's crazy.
It's,

656
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:05,010
it's amazing how many people just don't 
pay attention to anything but their 

657
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,571
phone.
I mean I see it constantly and I see it 

658
00:28:08,571 --> 00:28:11,091
when people are by themselves.
I see it when people with their 

659
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:11,091
families.
I see when people with their friends.

660
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:11,640
How many times have you gone to a 
restaurant?

661
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:16,641
You see a table full of people and 
everyone's on their phone and no one's 

662
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:16,641
talking to the people right in front of 
them.

663
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:19,590
Did have you done like colleges 
recently?

664
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,760
I stopped.
I stopped.

665
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,750
I stopped more than a decade ago.
Wow.

666
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,030
I stopped.
Uh,

667
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:31,031
I think I did.
University of Miami was the last one I 

668
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:31,031
did.
I did with Joey Diaz,

669
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:34,830
I think the coconut Grove Improv.
Just.

670
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,510
Yeah.
Oh,

671
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:39,610
thank God they closed because there were
so many fights breaking out.

672
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,150
It was so bad.
I literally told them that I would never

673
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:43,610
work.
Here again.

674
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:48,611
I go,
you people are so dominant over work 

675
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:48,611
here again.
And they were laughing.

676
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:48,611
I got you laughing.
I go,

677
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:53,280
I'm serious.
This is the dumbest fucking audience in 

678
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,280
the country.
I watched a guy do cocaine.

679
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,680
I was opening for like Steve Byrne or 
some like Craig's shoemaker,

680
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,700
like someone,
someone was opening for like 10 years 

681
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,770
ago and someone was doing cocaine on the
table while I was on the call.

682
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,790
I believe it will they.
What happened with that place is they 

683
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,070
started giving away free tickets and 
when you give away seconds.

684
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,140
Yep.
Fuck yourself.

685
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:12,130
Always,
always.

686
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,500
Those are bad,
but you paper the room,

687
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:16,160
you get terrible audiences.
So

688
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,610
for awhile I was trying to give free 
tickets to people who couldn't afford 

689
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,600
them,
so I'd always say my comps,

690
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,430
like I have 10 comps in like the middle 
of nowhere.

691
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,070
This actually happened in La Jolla and I
would tweet out like,

692
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:33,071
hey,
so if you can't afford to come to the 

693
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:33,071
show,
send me an email telling me why and I'll

694
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:33,071
get you tickets and I would check it 
myself,

695
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,400
you know,
the Whitney Whitney,

696
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,330
some email and one time this guy emails 
me just a testament to exactly,

697
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,560
you know,
give an inch,

698
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,130
take a mile and emails me and gives

699
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,410
me this long story.
He's a vet,

700
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,390
you know,
he's in a wheelchair,

701
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:51,391
he can't drive down,
he's going to have to get a cab and he 

702
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:51,391
can't afford to come.
And the,

703
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:55,260
you know,
the health insurance that health 

704
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,260
insurance is a joke and I'll all this 
whole thing.

705
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,870
I was like such a no brainer.
I was like,

706
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:56,500
Yep,
you got it.

707
00:29:56,501 --> 00:30:01,501
Two tickets can't wait.
And literally he started the email with 

708
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:01,600
like,
this probably isn't even you.

709
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:03,700
So Whitney's assistant like,
you know,

710
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,760
no problem and I'm such a big fan and 
Dah,

711
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:06,010
Dah,
Dah.

712
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,840
All right,
back to tickets.

713
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,230
All set.
Don't hear back from him at all.

714
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,540
I'm not checking it again.
Right before the show,

715
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:16,450
I'm looking through my emails.
It's 7:45.

716
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:18,430
The show's at eight.
I can email back from him.

717
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,030
Hey Babe.
Hey Babe,

718
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,160
I'm running a little late.
I'm running a little late and where do I

719
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:31,650
park?
It went from like Ajit,

720
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:34,900
like total,
like all and like respect and adulation.

721
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:39,901
You're probably not even going to check 
this and like I'm sure this will never 

722
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:40,030
have to.
Like I became his assistant.

723
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,880
It's a microcosm of a relationship.
He was courting you.

724
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:48,250
Then he got me and like went from 
literally and then I was like,

725
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:50,510
oh,
okay.

726
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:55,511
You know,
do you need me to come out and meet you 

727
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:55,511
in the dynamic?
Totally switched.

728
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:56,300
It's like as soon as you give someone 
something for free,

729
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,730
they stop respecting it.

730
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,630
Well,
you have,

731
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,660
it's,
it's hard when you're communicating with

732
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,540
someone just through email because you 
have to sort of ascertain,

733
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,190
is this person crazy?
Is this person Super Nice Person?

734
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,150
Completely delusional.
Is this email going to be received

735
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,780
in the way that I intended it?
Okay.

736
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,940
Is it gonna?
Be like,

737
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,680
Hey,
nice talking to you.

738
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,450
Glad you liked the show.
Appreciate it.

739
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,510
Good though.
So what do you.

740
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,280
Oh,
that's cool.

741
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,510
You do that.
That's interesting.

742
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:24,870
Well,
Hey,

743
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,670
nice talking to you.
Is it going to be just like,

744
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,560
oh,
I had a cool conversation with a guy,

745
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,460
or is it going to be open up the door to
a wacky person now?

746
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:34,050
The wacky person as Whitney Cummings.
Yeah.

747
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,370
Oh,
he still emails all the time.

748
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:38,140
Hey,
let me know next time you're in town.

749
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:38,860
I mean,
it's like.

750
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,890
And he behaves as if I'm doing him a 
favor.

751
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,370
I also had a great,
um,

752
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,830
a Heckler,
a guy that I got front row seats and 

753
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,470
like paid for everything.
Started heckling.

754
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,080
It's always the people you come tickets 
for.

755
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,240
This isn't La Jolla lawyers always,
you know,

756
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,860
it's very sketchy.
It's such scheduled.

757
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:03,861
There's no fucking.
All the security guards are open to 

758
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,860
anyone.
Bless their hearts.

759
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:07,540
They're stoned out of their fucking 
minds.

760
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:07,930
Like,
I mean,

761
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:09,220
it's just,
it's so unsafe.

762
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,980
It's.
And there's a lot of tension down there.

763
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:16,981
I don't know if it's because there's the
navy's down there or there's a lot of 

764
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:16,981
militaries that,
it,

765
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,580
there's a of money.
There's a lot of entitlement,

766
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,160
beautiful area,
but for some reason the Hoya,

767
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:23,520
it's like always,
I don't know,

768
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,460
there's always a fight.

769
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,660
There's always a fucking girl who's 
like,

770
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,970
fuck you,
like a couple breaks up.

771
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:29,740
I'm like,
what the fuck is happening?

772
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,540
Um,
I always have to kick people out of 

773
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,741
there.
And so this guys in the front row and 

774
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:38,050
Kevin Christie was opening for me and 
Kevin's very incisive,

775
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:38,920
like,
he's very,

776
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,520
like,
he's kind of used to this comic,

777
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:45,521
you know,
and he's like kind of quiet and it 

778
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:45,521
doesn't speak a lot,
but when he does,

779
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:46,550
it's just exactly,
it's just the truth.

780
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:49,040
Like he's just so real like that.
And uh,

781
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,580
he said something once because he was on
the road with me for awhile and like 35,

782
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:57,581
40 minutes into all my sets at the time,
a guy would just snap and start yelling 

783
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:03,071
at me and he's like,
I think what happens is they're like 

784
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:03,071
loving it.
Funny,

785
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:03,830
funny,
female comedian,

786
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:04,550
funny.
It's funny,

787
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:09,551
but like 40 minutes and you just become 
their wife or the girl that wouldn't 

788
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:11,090
fuck them or their mother or something.

789
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:16,090
And they just see you,
it's like all of a sudden you just 

790
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:16,520
become a woman who's yelling at them and
they're not allowed to talk back.

791
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,760
One guy just we'll snap.
It always happens.

792
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,120
And I had one guy like storm the stage 
at me once and be like,

793
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:24,700
who the fuck do you think you are?
Like,

794
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,990
I was like,
and it didn't feel like it was about me 

795
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:29,990
at all.
It felt like a very old wound,

796
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,650
dark,
sad and [inaudible].

797
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,660
I could tell right away.
This has nothing to do with me and what 

798
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:42,920
you're talking about.
Well,

799
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,060
I'll tell you,
I can.

800
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,100
I do remember what the.
This one guy in the front row that I 

801
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,340
comped was he sitting in the front and I
was like doing it.

802
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,600
And I did this.
This was like my first special.

803
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:55,940
I was getting my first special.
I did this joke about how every guy,

804
00:33:55,941 --> 00:34:00,941
somewhere in his house or apartment or 
whatever has like a jar of coins or like

805
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,270
a bowl of coins.
You know where you guys put your change,

806
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,080
like a change jar,
bowl.

807
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:11,430
You're red.
You probably just have a fucking throw 

808
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:15,300
away trash,
just put it right in the trash it away.

809
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:28,310
Oh my,
that's amazing.

810
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,510
So do you remember,
I mean there was a point in your life 

811
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,230
where I'm sure you had one pennies up to
make dinner.

812
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,000
You guys have like a,
you know,

813
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,410
um,
they're changed our.

814
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,240
And so I just said it and it was like 
whatever.

815
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,650
And then the guy went from like 
laughing,

816
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:44,180
laughing,
and then as soon as I said that joke,

817
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:49,100
he just looked at me and he went,
that's so we can pay for your shit.

818
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,760
I was like,
uh Oh.

819
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,000
And from then on out,
it was just like everything I said,

820
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,050
he'd be like,
well that's fucking,

821
00:34:57,051 --> 00:35:02,051
you did it on.
And it's because if you didn't fucking 

822
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:02,051
spend so much money,
he's literally,

823
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:04,360
he's in the front row lawn and you know 
that loan by himself,

824
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,380
by himself and you know that moment 
where someone's heckling and you're 

825
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:09,380
like,
if only I can hear them,

826
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,270
I'll keep going.
But if the audience can hear them,

827
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:13,400
I have to do something.
So I finally had to,

828
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,890
you had to go.
But at the lawyer comedy store,

829
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:19,280
there's like a window into the street,
so he went outside and just stood in the

830
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:21,320
window and stared at me for the rest of 
them.

831
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,840
Remember he was just standing there and 
it was like,

832
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,760
you know.
So I think,

833
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:30,920
I think comedy can really trigger 
trigger people.

834
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,460
Sometimes it's you're drinking,
you're out.

835
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:39,461
You have someone talking about a guy 
that's willing to go to a comedy by 

836
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:39,461
himself

837
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:43,220
though.
Sit in the front row already have red 

838
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,220
flags.
Just kick that person out right away.

839
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,700
This is the guy that emailed you.
So you got different guys.

840
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,450
Oh yes,
yes,

841
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:46,680
yes.
He emailed and yeah,

842
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,870
good point.
So you,

843
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:53,100
you have a connection with.
He's probably thinking he's going to be 

844
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,100
in love with you.
He's going to straighten you out.

845
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,290
So you're a little too mouthy.
He a little too talkative.

846
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,120
You have too many opinions.
And he's like,

847
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,190
yeah,
I'll fucking.

848
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,350
I know Yo Berko girls love that.
Well,

849
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:09,470
you know,
there are people that think that people 

850
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:09,570
need to be put in check and that people 
like it.

851
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,420
Comedian.
I'll tell you,

852
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,630
I'll tell you the story now,
but I'm not going to tell you who it is.

853
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,860
Okay.
Can I guess.

854
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,410
Yes.
But if you get it right,

855
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,450
I'm not going to know until after if I 
get it right,

856
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:27,451
just go.
Don't.

857
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,770
Because now I'm probably gonna do that 
anyway.

858
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,440
Um,
there is this thing,

859
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,610
I think that exactly what you're talking
to them.

860
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,440
Um,
I do think there is this thing

861
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,780
the same way women sometimes meet a man 
and they're like,

862
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,830
I can fix him when he's probably not 
broken and is happy and fine or like 

863
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:53,521
I'll whip him into.
I hear my friends say it all the time 

864
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:53,521
and I'm like,
no,

865
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:53,521
no,
he's fine.

866
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:54,220
He's,
he's happy.

867
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,140
You don't need to fix him.
He doesn't think he's broken.

868
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:01,710
And uh,
I think sometimes guys with me or like 

869
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:01,710
I'll tame her,
like I'll break her,

870
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,770
you know,
like I'll,

871
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,200
um,
and uh,

872
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,560
there was this comedian who sent me a 
message on,

873
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,230
I guess it was when I was on facebook or
wasn't my space.

874
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:15,730
It was one of those who I would always 
see around and I'm pretty elusive.

875
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:17,110
Like you and I,
we didn't get,

876
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,000
we don't haven't got to hang at the 
comedy store that much,

877
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,780
but like I kind of,
I'm in and I'm out less,

878
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,800
less,
less so now like I would hang now 

879
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,671
because like cool people are there now,
but when you were gone it was kind of 

880
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:30,220
toxic in there and it's intense and not 
like fun.

881
00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:31,950
Now it's little more fun.
Um,

882
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:37,050
and so I just get in and do my set and 
leave because I was trying to do a 

883
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,050
couple sets of night and um,
uh,

884
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,490
I would just be like,
Hey,

885
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,050
what's up?
And we wouldn't flirt,

886
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:41,850
but it would just be like,
hey,

887
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,780
and you know,
the kind of person who wants to give you

888
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,620
tags.

889
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:47,800
They're like,
you know,

890
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:49,640
what you should say there and it's like 
a.

891
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,660
and I get this message that was like 
rage,

892
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:58,130
like a rage rage email that was like,
you know,

893
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,740
you don't know what you're like,
you know,

894
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,280
the basic jest of it.
I don't remember how it started,

895
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:07,760
but it ended in like,
you don't know what makes you come.

896
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,300
I can show you what I know,
like it was like,

897
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:17,750
I was like,
I obviously accidentally actually say 

898
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,260
that in come.
I'm sure I still have the screen grab of

899
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:20,130
it because I said,
you know,

900
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,160
I said to dad,
how do you know what makes me.

901
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,460
I don't like it was just,
but it was like this Alpha thing,

902
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,150
like it was like a Alpha reaction I 
think,

903
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:34,020
or something like I just need to make 
you shame you or something.

904
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,920
I don't know what it was.
Yeah,

905
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,810
well that's an alpha.
Like what is that?

906
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:42,811
What,
what would it take for you to say that 

907
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:42,811
to a girl?

908
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:43,400
The crazy person who usually it's self 
obsessed,

909
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,460
like delusional,
delusional narcissism or something 

910
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,701
that's true.
Narcissistic to just to reach out like 

911
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:51,701
that to you.
That's,

912
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:55,910
you know what that is.
You are an accoutrement or you are like 

913
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,910
a,
a,

914
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,850
you're a piece of wardrobe in his life.
Interesting.

915
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,090
And you don't want him to try you on.
You know what I'm saying?

916
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,970
Like you like he's upset like you're in 
my life and it's not.

917
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,770
Why aren't you doing what I want you to 
do?

918
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,150
In my life,
my life,

919
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,390
clinical narcissism is that everyone is 
an extension of you and if you're not 

920
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,450
doing what I wrote,
you're acting out.

921
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,210
Yeah.
That's interesting.

922
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:19,450
Okay.
Well,

923
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:21,070
there's a lot of people that feel like 
that.

924
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:26,071
I mean,
that's a classic example of why 

925
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:28,231
Comedians don't like to work with other 
good comedians because they don't want 

926
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:29,100
anybody else doing well.
Yeah.

927
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,510
You know,
they don't want anybody.

928
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,560
It's got to be all about them.
Like how many bad comedians do we know 

929
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,690
that take the fucking force people on 
the road with them.

930
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,950
The worse,
worse,

931
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,910
worse,
worse.

932
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,120
It's so bad that you go,
okay,

933
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:44,260
do you hate your audience?

934
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,710
People I think were the funniest because
I,

935
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,570
my audience is paying money and you want
to laugh to want to have fun.

936
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,460
I have to watch them too.
Exactly.

937
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:57,760
It doesn't benefit me to have less 
talented people around me.

938
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:02,761
I'd actually do the opposite to a fault.
I feel like I tried to hire people who 

939
00:40:02,761 --> 00:40:02,761
are more talented than me in every area 
of my life,

940
00:40:02,761 --> 00:40:03,520
so that it makes me look better.

941
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:04,920
Well,
that's again,

942
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:09,921
you.
You're weirdly introspective in that 

943
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:11,811
way,
but there's a lot of people that get 

944
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:12,450
into comedy because of all the scars of 
their childhood,

945
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,370
like who we're talking about and they 
don't.

946
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,390
They don't heal those things.
Instead they just find workarounds.

947
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,660
They find a way where they can sort of 
express themselves and and so it's 

948
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,090
almost like,
see,

949
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:29,091
I told Ya,
I showed the world like they never come 

950
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:31,611
to a neutral point.
They never get over the childhood where 

951
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:31,611
they go,
Oh,

952
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:31,611
okay.
Well what am I doing?

953
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:32,190
Is there a benefit to what I'm doing 
here?

954
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,230
Should I just stop?
If I'm healthy now,

955
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,380
should I just stop what I'm doing or 
should I use what I'm doing and just 

956
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,450
enjoy it and have a good time?
And then you realize that I probably got

957
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:47,451
here because of an unhealthy obsession 
or because of a bad childhood or 

958
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:52,281
whatever,
but now that I'm kind of moving past 

959
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:55,011
that,
maybe I could use this position to just 

960
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:55,011
have some fun

961
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:59,720
in exactly what you're saying.
Like you just made it so clear to me 

962
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,050
what I was not being clear about in the 
beginning of the,

963
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,680
you know,
if you bring unfunny people on the road 

964
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,861
years really funny comparatively,
and so all of a sudden you've created 

965
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:11,710
this little world for yourself where you
become this king of the idiots,

966
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,500
but if you were to step outside that 
world,

967
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,480
you're all of a sudden at the bottom of 
the food chain,

968
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,580
like you create a world where at the top
of the food chain,

969
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,840
which is why it was important to me to 
go to other countries,

970
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:24,910
be around people that have no idea who I
am,

971
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,540
that I don't pay that don't think I'm 
funny.

972
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:33,710
That can you understand what I'm saying?
It's just very humbling and then you're 

973
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:33,710
like,
oh,

974
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,490
who am without all this stuff

975
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,750
without achievements and money and car 
or what a car,

976
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:40,610
whatever it is,
you know,

977
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,910
because I'm afraid that I might do that 
by accident.

978
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,530
You know?
Because if you have people around you 

979
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:50,530
who are paid,
who are afraid to say no to you,

980
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,280
that's how you stop getting funny.
Everyone around you is like,

981
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,580
like I saw Chris Rock at the store 
wants,

982
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:58,100
I'm sure you have this where he was 
working on,

983
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,080
I don't know,
like not the Oscars or something.

984
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,420
And he got on stage and he said 
something that was just like,

985
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:04,010
Hey,
I'm sorry I'm late.

986
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:04,750
I've,
you know,

987
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,990
my car was,
you know,

988
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,520
I couldn't find a spot for it.
Never was like,

989
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,290
ha ha ha.
And he was like,

990
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:14,650
that wasn't funny.
Please don't laugh unless I say 

991
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,060
something funny,
please treat me like I'm normal.

992
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:17,590
Yeah.
He was like,

993
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,310
that's how comics stopping funny is 
because people enable the and you know,

994
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:24,530
they use it when you get so big like 
you.

995
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:25,580
It's like,
you know,

996
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,490
people stop as.
I mean your audience I'm sure is really,

997
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,540
you know.

998
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,410
Well we can all be guilty of it,
you know,

999
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,420
I think just what you're talking about 
is like navigating all these landmines 

1000
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,860
that success can setup for you.
Put It,

1001
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,950
you know,
which are better land minds than 

1002
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,540
failure,
but still landmines and the landmines of

1003
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:48,541
fame or particularly intoxicating 
because when someone has a bunch of fans

1004
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:50,830
that say,
oh my God,

1005
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:52,570
you know Mike,
fuck faces here.

1006
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,620
Yay.
Oh my God,

1007
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:55,300
it's Mike.
And they go run up to you.

1008
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,210
I can't believe you're so amazing.
Thank you.

1009
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,280
Thank you very much.
Take a picture with me.

1010
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:01,320
I'm cool with God.
You know,

1011
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,080
and it's.
It becomes this thing where you,

1012
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:04,690
you,
you,

1013
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:05,980
you get accustomed to that

1014
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,160
so myopic and you forget that there's 6 
billion people that don't have

1015
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,200
any fucking idea who you are.
And if Mike fuck face is around Tony 

1016
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,090
Mcdonald face and Tony Mick,
Dick face is more famous like Tony 

1017
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:21,270
Minute dictations a movie out now.
Then Mike Fuck.

1018
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:23,670
Face gets really mad.
Like Tony Big Dick face.

1019
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,010
Exactly right.
You ever seen those guys before?

1020
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:27,280
Both

1021
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:32,250
represented by Barry Katz.
I think they just left.

1022
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

1023
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,740
They're doing his podcast.
They just wanted the three yards,

1024
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,890
but it's.
But is that sort of.

1025
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,080
I literally found myself,
because it's also,

1026
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:47,110
if you do achieve anything,
it doesn't matter because you're just 

1027
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:47,110
comparing yourself some with more 
achievements.

1028
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,970
So I'm recreating this feeling of 
failure at every level of success and 

1029
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,460
recreating this unhappiness at every 
level where I have no real problems.

1030
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,790
You know?
It's like,

1031
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:00,960
yeah,
I have my bullshit problem.

1032
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,360
They're fake problems.
It's like,

1033
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:02,990
you know,
it's like,

1034
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:03,920
yeah,
my parents are sick.

1035
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,540
Yeah.
I have a lot of,

1036
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,830
you know,
real things,

1037
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:07,580
but it's also,
it's like,

1038
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,760
you know,
I can pay the bill to get them.

1039
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Like I literally am going through this 
thing where it's like nursing homes and 

1040
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,180
care for,
for older people.

1041
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:18,200
And I'm like,
the fuck,

1042
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:20,930
do people pay for this?
I have to go on tour to pay for it.

1043
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:21,800
I mean I have to,
you know,

1044
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:25,580
thank God I get to do that for a living 
and the casinos and shit.

1045
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:27,440
But it's a fortune.
And I'm like,

1046
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,400
oh.
And my dad is,

1047
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,630
you know,
is a vet.

1048
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:31,530
And I looked at the vet facilities and 
was just like,

1049
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,120
are you fund

1050
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,780
this?
This is where vets go.

1051
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,930
The guys that fucking lost their limbs 
for our country,

1052
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,200
this is where you're putting them.
I mean that's her dying fucking 

1053
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,200
facility.

1054
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,880
We had to do these.
We did these benefits,

1055
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,910
these events called fight for the troops
and we did these for the intrepid in 

1056
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,140
intrepid,
center for excellence,

1057
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,770
which is sounds cool and establishment 
that they.

1058
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,840
They've the,
these facilities,

1059
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
they're creating these state of the art 
facilities to deal with people with 

1060
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,111
traumatic brain injuries and so they 
showed us all these guys and it's 

1061
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,420
unbelievably heartbreaking.
See these people like with their wives 

1062
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,811
and their children and their families 
and they're trying to rehabilitate them 

1063
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:17,411
and then going through all these steps.
But what was more disheartening than 

1064
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:21,041
anything was to realize that all this 
stuff is privately funded because the 

1065
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:25,000
United States government just.
They don't allocate enough money to 

1066
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,790
treatment of these troops when they get 
home.

1067
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:30,791
They just don't.
So we have to raise all this money for 

1068
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:30,791
these people.
So while we're doing this,

1069
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:35,571
like they wanted us to talk about it at 
the beginning of it and I have to 

1070
00:45:35,571 --> 00:45:39,791
measure myself because it's on 
television and it's what I want to say 

1071
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:43,730
is this is fucking crazy that we have to
do a fight to raise.

1072
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,910
We're going to give people brain damage 
so that we can

1073
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:52,020
no raise money for brain damage and 
raise the money for all the weapons you 

1074
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,450
that they really seem to find money for 
it,

1075
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:54,790
but not for the humans that use the 
weapon but these guys.

1076
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,880
But it's so ironic in a lot of ways 
because these people are fighting.

1077
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,110
Okay.
And if they're fighting.

1078
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,980
So like a bunch of people got knocked 
out in the show.

1079
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:06,370
So they got some brain damage and I mean
obviously they're competing,

1080
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,070
it's their decision,
they're,

1081
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,990
they're going for glory.
The trying to make it as a fighter,

1082
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:16,410
but were the end result is they're this,
they're getting pounded on so that we 

1083
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,340
can make money.
It's crazy.

1084
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:21,970
So they could help people who have brain
damage.

1085
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,570
It's a must.
That is the most Chinese finger trap.

1086
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,260
Oh my God.
It's like the amount of brain damage you

1087
00:46:29,261 --> 00:46:32,190
get from MMA is so minuscule and 
compared to an ied,

1088
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:37,230
but it's also,
why the fuck do we not set money aside 

1089
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:38,050
for this?

1090
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,150
Why?
How could there be what?

1091
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,890
Find out what every congressman gets.
Find out what everybody's.

1092
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:48,210
Every senator gets.
Chop a chunk of that shit out and send 

1093
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:48,760
it to the intrepid center.
I mean,

1094
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:53,761
there's gotta be a way that there's 
gotta be some fucking red tape and 

1095
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:57,601
bureaucracy that you can cut and you 
could send some of that money to help 

1096
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:01,051
take care of these people that you are 
forcing to go overseas and fight these 

1097
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,190
battles.
A friend of mine who was in the army,

1098
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,230
he told me that the statistic on vets 
committing suicide,

1099
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:09,820
it's insane.
It's insane.

1100
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,190
I want to say yours,
what I want to say.

1101
00:47:12,191 --> 00:47:14,050
What's one every like seven minutes.
Oh yeah,

1102
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,430
it is.
It's something like that.

1103
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,900
Yeah.
Well Jamie can look it up,

1104
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:21,700
but it's fucking insane.
It's more people die of 22 a day.

1105
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,790
Oh my God.
Twenty two a day in 2012 more US 

1106
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:28,990
soldiers committed suicide than were 
killed in.

1107
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:29,740
Yeah.

1108
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,720
Yeah.
I mean it's like,

1109
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,440
what do you mean?
It's just,

1110
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:36,940
it's,
it's too crazy.

1111
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:38,530
And um,
yeah.

1112
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:40,190
And then I'm like,
Oh God,

1113
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,380
where is my soy milk?
I'm amazed.

1114
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,840
It's only 22 a day.
I thought it was.

1115
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,210
No,
I thought it was one every seven minutes

1116
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,470
or something.
But that's an average.

1117
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:50,660
Maybe it is some days I don't like 
throwing statistics around on this.

1118
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,190
No,
no.

1119
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,620
Talking about people that have served.
I just know too many.

1120
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,530
I know too much of it.
I've talked to too many guys and I,

1121
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:58,900
I've,
I've talked to too many people that,

1122
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,120
you know,
the reality of it is so bleak.

1123
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,320
And also,
uh,

1124
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,840
from what little I know about it is that
um,

1125
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:10,020
and then the drone guys are,
is a real nightmare because there's all 

1126
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:11,680
this Ah,
you know,

1127
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,780
normally when you are in combat and you 
come back,

1128
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:18,781
you do a physical neutralization period.
Like you go to Germany or some for like 

1129
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:22,891
five days and like they chill you out 
before you go back to your family and 

1130
00:48:22,891 --> 00:48:24,280
kids after you've just been combat.
But these drone guys,

1131
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:29,281
not only is the technology is so 
advanced that they're seeing all these 

1132
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:29,530
women and children,
they're not in the fog of war,

1133
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,560
right?
They don't just see like threat threat 

1134
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,211
threat because when you are getting shot
at a kid is might as well be a guy with 

1135
00:48:36,211 --> 00:48:36,760
a gun.
So,

1136
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,110
so these guys are seeing these people 
getting shot super close up.

1137
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,930
They're not able to.
They're seeing their own guys get shot,

1138
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,960
like they're seeing it and then they go 
upstairs to their wife and kids and 

1139
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,620
there's just no period for their brains 
to acclimate to it.

1140
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:55,650
And it's,
there's a serious atrophy of a drone 

1141
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:56,890
pilots and they're just raise the wages 
of it so that it'll attract more because

1142
00:48:56,891 --> 00:49:00,490
so few people want to do it.
Really to doing it in your basement like

1143
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:03,120
a video game just,
um,

1144
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,640
is actually even more traumatic oddly.
But also the suicide rate.

1145
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:11,030
Apparently it's even worse among the 
soldiers that didn't kill anyone.

1146
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,080
Anyone,
because they have guilt and shame about 

1147
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,080
it.
Whoa.

1148
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,080
Yeah.

1149
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:21,470
Well,
from what I've talked to with guys that 

1150
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,070
were in the seals are rangers,
special operatives guys,

1151
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,400
is that those guys have way less issues.
Seals and rangers.

1152
00:49:28,621 --> 00:49:30,000
Okay.
Because first of all,

1153
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,300
mentally they're going to be the most 
durable.

1154
00:49:33,301 --> 00:49:33,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

1155
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,600
It's never the strongest guys.
That's always the most.

1156
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:37,590
Yeah.
Well,

1157
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:40,380
those guys are terrible.
Mentally more durable.

1158
00:49:40,381 --> 00:49:45,381
They have a better understanding.
They have way deeper and more intense 

1159
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:48,420
comradery than the average person does.
And then on top of that,

1160
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,160
they're,
they're proactive.

1161
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,320
They're the ones who were hunting down 
bad guys.

1162
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,360
They're not waiting for people to attack
them.

1163
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:59,390
They're going after that.
So it's a totally different kind of 

1164
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,181
thing.
Like if they plot a mission and they're 

1165
00:50:02,181 --> 00:50:02,250
going to go fuck somebody up,
like they're,

1166
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,600
they're,
they're hunting.

1167
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,120
They're not being hunted when you're 
being hunted.

1168
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,940
That's where the stress comes.
Food,

1169
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,530
I wanted to send you this,
you probably already read it.

1170
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,950
It's called Sapiens I think.
And uh,

1171
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,040
it's essentially,
it's about anxiety and this a book you 

1172
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,830
just touched,
that was a different one.

1173
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,630
I realized I had been texting you too 
many books.

1174
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:26,700
Yeah,

1175
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,420
both can fill out to say most girls 
said,

1176
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,140
you know,
naked photos,

1177
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:35,050
new tags.
I said science books,

1178
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,380
like,
no wonder I'm fucking alone.

1179
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,930
Uh,
and uh,

1180
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,730
it's about anxiety and everyone's like,
I have anxiety,

1181
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:45,731
I have anxiety.
And it's like anxiety is actually talks 

1182
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:45,731
about sort of the origin of it.
And there's,

1183
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:49,960
it's two pronged.
One is because I had a lot of shame 

1184
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,360
about anxiety too.
And anxiety,

1185
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,090
shame about it.
Like why am I anxious?

1186
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,890
It's like we're actually supposed to be 
anxious,

1187
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,600
you know,
just as by the laws of survival of the 

1188
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,501
fittest.
The fittest were the ones that were 

1189
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:02,501
anxious,
you know,

1190
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:02,501
thousands of years ago,
the anxious,

1191
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:03,080
hypervigilant people were the ones that 
were like,

1192
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:04,430
well,
there's fucking tiger we should move.

1193
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,800
And the ones that didn't have anxiety 
just got eaten alive.

1194
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,450
And you're definitely one of the 
watchers.

1195
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,070
Yeah,
I think I've definitely,

1196
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:11,070
I've had anxiety.

1197
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,310
They come and watch sleep.
I know you're up at night.

1198
00:51:13,311 --> 00:51:15,180
It's why we've got weed.
Yeah.

1199
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,110
You're also a scene of a comedian.
So you live a night life.

1200
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,430
Yeah.
I have adrenaline,

1201
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:24,530
uh,
people who grew up in hectic homes who 

1202
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,210
produced Adrenalin young usually have an
adrenaline addiction.

1203
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,770
Oh,
I definitely have that.

1204
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:29,630
Yeah.
Because your body is producing so much,

1205
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,570
John.
It's addictive.

1206
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,110
You must huge.
Also,

1207
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:36,380
to your point just now is there was.
I never thought.

1208
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,510
Of course I hadn't thought about it.
I'm not smart enough to,

1209
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:43,511
but I have never known that humans are 
not designed to be at the top of the 

1210
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:47,711
food chain.
We're only at the top of the food chain 

1211
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:48,350
because we have weapons and the reason 
we have weapons is because we had really

1212
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,230
large brains,
which was actually not helpful at all.

1213
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:56,231
It's really inefficient and uneconomical
for energy because I guess our brains 

1214
00:51:56,231 --> 00:51:57,380
burned like 25 or 30 percent of our 
calories or something.

1215
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:00,710
So chimpanzees and apes head smaller 
brains.

1216
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:02,420
They were able to climb trees and avoid 
threats.

1217
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:07,090
Like a big brain is like a disaster 
except that we invented tools,

1218
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,640
so we sort of not based on merit.
We superficially,

1219
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:12,860
once we embedded tools jumped to the top
of the food chain,

1220
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:17,861
but we don't deserve to be there because
without weapons a lot of species would 

1221
00:52:17,861 --> 00:52:20,210
kill us,
but we can figure out weapons.

1222
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:21,920
So of course we deserve to be there 
totally.

1223
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:24,260
But as soon as the weapons are gone,
we're vulnerable.

1224
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,040
So vulnerable to animals.
Yes to a lot because we're not truly at 

1225
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,700
the top of the food chain.
We only are at the top of the food chain

1226
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,430
if we have a weapon.
So there's that anxiety.

1227
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,660
A turtle without a shell,
but the second you drop your weapon,

1228
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,020
you're in the middle of the food channel
and drop it.

1229
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:41,320
Bitch.

1230
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:47,480
I'm not as agile as you fucking weapon.
That's how you stay alive.

1231
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:49,140
That's what.
That's the anxiety.

1232
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:54,300
Hold the fucking weapon.
Don't drop it and be and keep your shit 

1233
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:54,860
together and keep on fucking high alert 
because the second,

1234
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:58,070
if your back is to Elian and the weapons
pointing this way,

1235
00:52:58,071 --> 00:53:01,810
you're still gonna die.
You know the lines are problematic.

1236
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,500
Even if you have a weapon,
it's like,

1237
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,540
yeah,
they eat Bolus for fucking breakfast.

1238
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,500
This balance of the second you run out 
of bullets,

1239
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:10,820
it's over.
Well,

1240
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:11,690
you know,
when,

1241
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,140
when you think about what made a human a
human,

1242
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,050
it's really fascinating because it 
becomes like what came first,

1243
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:23,051
the chicken or the egg,
like what were we like when we will 

1244
00:53:23,051 --> 00:53:23,051
Australia pacificus,
you know,

1245
00:53:23,051 --> 00:53:26,040
they have these depictions of us and 
what we looked like all hairy and

1246
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,040
with fucking sloped foreheads and shit.
We were pretty close to people but not 

1247
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:36,111
really people.
And when you really look at the fossil 

1248
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:39,441
record,
what they understand that these were 

1249
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:41,810
only talking about this kind of person 
like you and I for a couple of hundred 

1250
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:41,970
thousand years.
Yeah.

1251
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,100
That's so recent.
So recent.

1252
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,440
It's so weird.
I have an extra bone in my foot.

1253
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,210
What I have.
What's your foot doing?

1254
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:55,490
My feet are webbed.
Is that a turn off of all those foot 

1255
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:55,490
fetishes?
Um,

1256
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,120
you know what's so funny is that I'm 
wearing flip flops today.

1257
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:59,990
It's real power move.
You know,

1258
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,650
there's human.
You really have webbed feet.

1259
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,310
No,
I don't.

1260
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:06,210
I'm joking.
But there are these foot fetishes,

1261
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:06,980
however you.
Hi.

1262
00:54:06,981 --> 00:54:08,750
Hi Guys.
There's foot fetishes.

1263
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,450
It's out there and like if you google 
me,

1264
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:14,900
I think when you come me his feet is 
like the second or third one,

1265
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,270
which I um,
you know,

1266
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,880
I mean that's for most people in the 
public eye,

1267
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:24,881
like feet is always like to like google 
charlise Aaron don't do it and just see 

1268
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:26,180
what the,
see what they come up,

1269
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,260
you know.
Um,

1270
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:32,350
so I'm,
I'm really afraid that if I had met 

1271
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,061
this,
although I'm going to lose my foot 

1272
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:35,441
fetish demo,
but I had this pain in my foot and I 

1273
00:54:35,441 --> 00:54:37,400
think we're probably a little bit 
similar you much more so.

1274
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:39,740
But um,
I have a pretty high tolerance for pain.

1275
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,260
He just learned it,
grind and go to doctors growing up.

1276
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:44,210
It's just like suck it up.
That's what I caught on fire.

1277
00:54:44,211 --> 00:54:47,360
I went to school,
like that's basically like how my family

1278
00:54:47,361 --> 00:54:47,570
was.

1279
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:52,570
You just suck it up and you man up.
So I had this pain in my foot or my,

1280
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:58,130
like my big toe and then my third toe,
like once every two weeks,

1281
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,340
like real bad and it would be like,
it's just a stabbing,

1282
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:02,630
awful pain.
But I just was like,

1283
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:03,290
oh,
that's my foot,

1284
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,500
like once every two weeks my foot has 
like a spasm and it lasts for like,

1285
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:11,650
I don't know,
like two minutes and then I get through 

1286
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:13,091
it and I was in a writer's room one day 
and my feet were up on the table and 

1287
00:55:13,091 --> 00:55:14,360
then I was like,
had the pain came and I was like,

1288
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,170
and I'm like screaming,
and two minutes later I'm like,

1289
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:19,130
anyway,
so,

1290
00:55:19,131 --> 00:55:19,970
uh,
act three,

1291
00:55:19,971 --> 00:55:20,900
what should we.
And everyone's like,

1292
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,080
what the fuck was that?
I was like,

1293
00:55:23,081 --> 00:55:24,050
Oh,
I have this thing,

1294
00:55:24,051 --> 00:55:26,570
I have this foot spasm that happens once
every two weeks.

1295
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:28,040
It's just like my foot.
And everyone was like,

1296
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,360
no,
that's not a thing.

1297
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,520
That's not a,
you have to get,

1298
00:55:31,521 --> 00:55:36,521
go to a podiatrist.
First Time I've ever went to a 

1299
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:36,521
podiatrist and he gave me an extra and 
he's like,

1300
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:36,521
Oh,
you have an extra foot.

1301
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:41,350
I'm sorry you have an but even extra 
bone in your foot between your second 

1302
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:41,630
and third toe.
And he's like,

1303
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:45,530
it's basically just remanence of being 
an android

1304
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,020
really.
Now is it?

1305
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,160
It's not bone spurs like a broken foot

1306
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,260
quarterly,
just like an extra.

1307
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:57,970
You can't really see it.
It's just like an extra bone right here.

1308
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,770
Whoa.
Like one think.

1309
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,090
Hmm.
You know,

1310
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,300
because we used to have more bones in 
our feet and you're just like,

1311
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:07,690
that's fucking real.
Like it was not that long ago.

1312
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,140
Why would we have extra bones though?
What was it?

1313
00:56:11,141 --> 00:56:13,840
Something about the uh,
uh,

1314
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,640
I'll find out for you.
It's something about the webbing or 

1315
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:20,640
something.

1316
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,200
My friend Steve Rinella went to Bolivia 
and he stayed with Toumani,

1317
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:27,220
the tribe,
the tribe and Bolivia.

1318
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,240
And they don't wear shoes and they live 
in the rainforest and their feet,

1319
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,020
their feet are splayed out.
It's interestingly,

1320
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,190
our feet are like this and that.
Kinetic or is it worn from rights?

1321
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,260
Worn from writing all the time.
So let's just walking constantly 

1322
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,951
barefoot.
But like our feet are like this where 

1323
00:56:46,951 --> 00:56:47,060
their feet are spread,
like their toes are spread out.

1324
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:49,240
Women's in America,
like all.

1325
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,100
Yeah,
they're all getting old.

1326
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:55,000
So many girls I see in their feet,
their toes are taken left and right.

1327
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,070
They're just trying to run away from 
each other.

1328
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,720
These fucking shoes that don't show.
They're not shaped like a foot cocktail.

1329
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:05,350
Shrimp who's fucking feet are shaped 
like that Asian bound.

1330
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,660
That's like they have to do it.
Right.

1331
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,310
That's what these Toumani people.

1332
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:15,090
Rinella was there and he was walking 
through the woods with these people and 

1333
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:15,460
he was like,
this is incredible.

1334
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:18,190
Because they've never had shoes.
They don't have any shoes.

1335
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:19,780
And if you give them shoes,
they try them on.

1336
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:20,550
They're like,
what the fuck?

1337
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,290
And they throw it aside and they have 
these thick,

1338
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,460
thick soles of their feet.
Sure.

1339
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,100
Confirm.
Just constantly.

1340
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,760
That's my.
That's exactly like you keep saying my 

1341
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:32,760
goal,
like you're,

1342
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,930
we acclimate to where we are.
So I want to have the thick,

1343
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:39,931
thick sole in my personality.
I want to be that person as the.

1344
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,960
I don't want to be the one who has the 
Pha is like can fall apart.

1345
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,810
Yes.
Yes.

1346
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,340
I don't want to be this like,
oh my God,

1347
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,390
do you have like Stevia?
Like I don't.

1348
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:56,391
I,
I started realizing I had all these 

1349
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:57,070
fucking needs.
Don't you think change means that we see

1350
00:57:57,071 --> 00:58:00,330
around us constantly because it's so 
socially enforced.

1351
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:05,370
It's so like coconut milk,
soy milk and did a $6 latte and it 

1352
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:05,470
becomes normal after a while and I was 
like,

1353
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:10,471
this is not fucking normal.
Also comforting to like behave in these 

1354
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:14,221
patterns that we've already seen before.
It makes you feel like you're a normal 

1355
00:58:14,221 --> 00:58:14,890
person and it makes us feel like because
we're designed to be part of a tribe and

1356
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,830
to fit in and standing out,
it's like produces,

1357
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,950
you know,
stress because it means we're less safe.

1358
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:22,620
And I was like,
I do not want to like,

1359
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,830
because you drive around and you're 
like,

1360
00:58:23,831 --> 00:58:25,510
oh this fucking asshole,
this whole asshole.

1361
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:27,070
And you're like,
I'm one of those assholes.

1362
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,440
Right?
I've got to remove myself from the 

1363
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,440
situation and go watch kids have surgery
for,

1364
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,570
you know,
a lot of that,

1365
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,890
these asshole things like the fucking 
bro rage and all that jazz.

1366
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,200
A lot of that goes away when you're in a
small town.

1367
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,080
Tell me,
that's interesting.

1368
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,880
In Boulder,
one of the things that I've found,

1369
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:44,710
and I was only in boulder for a few 
months,

1370
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:46,590
but one of the things that I've found 
when I was there,

1371
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:48,610
I was like,
people drive way more polite.

1372
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:53,970
They're way nicer,
like they let people in and they don't 

1373
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:54,820
cut people off as much stone.
No,

1374
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:55,050
no,
no.

1375
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,350
That too,
but there's less of them.

1376
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,180
There's only 100,000
people in town.

1377
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,480
So when you have a small community,
first of all there's less diffusion of 

1378
00:59:06,971 --> 00:59:11,971
responsibility because you and that 
person is probably going to see each 

1379
00:59:11,971 --> 00:59:14,701
other again.
So if I give someone the finger on the 

1380
00:59:14,701 --> 00:59:17,941
highway on the four or five,
what are the odds I'm going to meet 

1381
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:17,941
that?
Do it again?

1382
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:18,550
Zero.
Probably there's less like accountable.

1383
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,620
We can be more anonymous and more.

1384
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,430
You have more responsibility as a 
community.

1385
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:27,200
Like if you see someone pulled over the 
side of the road,

1386
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:29,410
you have more desire to pull over and 
help

1387
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,640
dumb.
It's like tribal.

1388
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:32,710
I mean that's really like a tribe 
mentality.

1389
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,610
Like there was these people that were 
pushing their car the other day and they

1390
00:59:36,611 --> 00:59:38,680
were on the side of the road and I was 
thinking,

1391
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:39,270
fuck,
shut,

1392
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,900
get out of the car and help them push 
the car.

1393
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,030
And uh,
I think I watched them do it.

1394
00:59:43,031 --> 00:59:43,390
I'm like,
yeah,

1395
00:59:43,391 --> 00:59:44,440
they're okay.
They got it.

1396
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,380
It's up on the hill there,
there it's up on the,

1397
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:47,330
uh,
the curb there.

1398
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:52,340
They're going to be okay.
But I was thinking like if this was a 

1399
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,620
small town for sure,
I'd pull over and I was thinking that at

1400
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:58,621
that moment,
because of the time that I spent living 

1401
00:59:58,621 --> 00:59:58,621
in Boulder,
I was,

1402
00:59:58,621 --> 01:00:03,300
I was amazed at how polite people were 
and also the less people like in the 

1403
01:00:03,971 --> 01:00:08,971
town,
like when I was in this town in the 

1404
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:08,971
mountains,
they would wave when you would go by and

1405
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:10,220
people lift their hand up when you would
drive by,

1406
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,750
he'd pass each other and everybody and I
got used to doing it and we all did it,

1407
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:18,930
you know,
as you were driving this way or that 

1408
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,731
person driving that way,
you will lift your hand up and you wave 

1409
01:00:20,731 --> 01:00:20,731
to them because there's not that many of
you see in La.

1410
01:00:20,731 --> 01:00:25,680
I think they're so fucking many people 
that we lose the idea of value of,

1411
01:00:26,591 --> 01:00:31,591
uh,
of our fellow humans because our fellow 

1412
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:31,591
humans become a bird fight.

1413
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:31,591
Yeah.
Become a burden.

1414
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:34,270
There's too many of us.
And so there's a lot of benefit in that.

1415
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,610
Like for guys like you or for people 
like you and I,

1416
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:38,670
it's great because there's so many clubs
we can work at,

1417
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:43,950
you know,
there's so much variety as far as like 

1418
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:44,230
restaurants we could eat at are places 
we can go and so much culture to see.

1419
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:49,590
But also you're dealing with this 
massive volume of people and it's hard 

1420
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:54,181
to keep your perspective.
It's hard to keep your perspective just 

1421
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:56,911
with the sheer numbers and I think in a 
lot of ways it mirrors what we're 

1422
01:00:56,911 --> 01:00:59,950
talking about with even with celebrity 
or fame or with wealth that it's hard to

1423
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:01,810
keep perspective.
Like for people,

1424
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:06,490
people need adversity,
difficult situations that we need things

1425
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,050
in order to keep our perspective.

1426
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,470
You know what's interesting?
Have you been to Tokyo?

1427
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:15,520
Yes.
So Tokyo is liked hectic.

1428
01:01:15,521 --> 01:01:17,920
I mean there's not as many.
It's not as much of a car culture,

1429
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:21,350
but there's a weird.
I wonder what part of it's cultural,

1430
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,070
whether cars play it because it's 
really.

1431
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:25,330
Everything is times square.
Totally.

1432
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:30,380
That's like a big time square,
but there's like this concept of space 

1433
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:30,850
and it's not like when I go to New York 
it's like fuck you,

1434
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:31,660
fuck you,
excuse me.

1435
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:36,661
You know,
and it's like you're just like in a rat 

1436
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:38,431
race.
Whereas in Tokyo there was this weird 

1437
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,300
harmonic sort of.
It's almost like choreographed,

1438
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,730
so less of a like I don't know what 
that.

1439
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:44,830
Less aggression.
More respect.

1440
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:45,670
Yeah.
Maybe it's.

1441
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,470
Maybe it is that cultural thing we were 
talking about earlier,

1442
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:50,230
but it's less of like I get it.
Maybe it's maybe it's because we live in

1443
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,990
a capitalist society where it's all like
we're competing with everybody too,

1444
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,990
but they compete in a very different way
than we do

1445
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:01,790
compete with.
They have a lot of honor and behavior 

1446
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:05,010
patterns and this is expected to follow.
It's a very different world,

1447
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:07,560
but I was amazed how polite people were 
in Tokyo.

1448
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:08,500
I was just literally,

1449
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:13,620
I got.
I mean I accidentally was rude so many 

1450
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,260
because when a cab picks you up,
you're not allowed to open the door.

1451
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:19,130
The door opens and it's considered rude.
If you open the door yourself,

1452
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:19,700
close at

1453
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,020
driver gets up and opens and closes it 
for you.

1454
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:27,370
Yeah,
like it's rude to do something for 

1455
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,300
yourself and it's um,
it's weird because I just,

1456
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,690
it makes you feel like you're going to 
be robbed because everyone's like,

1457
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,820
how can I help you?
It's like the service is like,

1458
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:33,900
you know,
as you said,

1459
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:36,780
it's all about honor and dignity and 
taking pride in your work,

1460
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:38,670
which were all about fucking shortcuts.
It's like,

1461
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:43,560
how do I know all about doing something 
the most difficult way,

1462
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:46,980
like doing or the most painstaking 
gains.

1463
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:51,540
Like Samurais there was never seen an 
actual Samurai sword.

1464
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:55,440
Now of course Joe's got one in his 
pocket.

1465
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:59,760
Guys.
Cheeses from the 15 hundreds.

1466
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Okay.
The Real Samurai sword from the 15 

1467
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:05,480
hundreds,
like legitimately.

1468
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,850
And if you look at that blade,
that blade was made by some guy,

1469
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,880
so turned on right now.
Steel pounded it,

1470
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,520
folded it over,
pounded it again,

1471
01:03:14,521 --> 01:03:16,560
folded it over,
pounded again.

1472
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,770
It takes for ever for.
You can see if you look at the actual 

1473
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:22,000
emily line.
No.

1474
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,510
Well,
that's so much more humanizing.

1475
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:27,330
It's like if there's just an assembly 
line that's making these,

1476
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,620
you know,
as a human,

1477
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:33,621
you just feel like a robot.
You feel like you are robbed of your 

1478
01:03:33,621 --> 01:03:33,621
individuality.
Right.

1479
01:03:33,621 --> 01:03:33,621
You know,
this is like,

1480
01:03:33,621 --> 01:03:37,590
you can take pride in your work,
but they did a different than anybody.

1481
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:39,960
They did it different than anybody who's
making swords.

1482
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:45,170
I mean they,
they had sword making and sort of get 

1483
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,140
your core feel on point for this.
The real deal.

1484
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,000
Is this to actually kill people or is 
this the Samurai fight?

1485
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:55,010
Probably killed people.
What do you think it feels like to stab 

1486
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:55,290
someone?
I bet it's not easy.

1487
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,830
Easy.
In what way?

1488
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,710
I mean,
you're way stronger than me.

1489
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,610
That's a good.
So if you're,

1490
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,450
what's the stomach?

1491
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:08,450
It's probably pretty.
You need to create a replica of what it 

1492
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,020
would be like to stab someone.
Would it be like watermelon?

1493
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,790
No.
You kill a deer.

1494
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:15,810
Oh yeah.
Get like an animal that's not obvious,

1495
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,300
but like ribs,
ribs stop it.

1496
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,590
No ribs can if you're weak,
you know?

1497
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,150
But it depends on how heavy the blade 
is.

1498
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,710
Like does anyone ever tried to stab 
someone?

1499
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:28,200
It's like the ribs just stopped the 
whole thing from for sure,

1500
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,030
because that's what ribs are for.
To protect your.

1501
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:35,410
Yeah,
I mean a weak person who stabs you in 

1502
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,680
the wrong spot with a small knife is 
probably not going to get it in,

1503
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,350
but somebody who stabs you with that 
fucking thing,

1504
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,840
the odds of that not going through your 
ribs,

1505
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,750
pretty small.
If you're a strong person,

1506
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:48,300
most likely you're going to penetrate 
their entire body,

1507
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:52,530
but it's also mirrored in archery 
bowhunting.

1508
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:57,531
That's like one of the most important 
aspects of bowhunting is to have a 

1509
01:04:57,531 --> 01:04:59,070
heavier Arrow that has a sharp blade 
with a powerful bow.

1510
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:01,980
So it goes through bone,
so it goes through the ribs,

1511
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,560
doesn't go through the rows of it,
stops at the ribs.

1512
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:07,560
Then you just have a wounded animal.
Where are you on bone marrow?

1513
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,420
Tiny thing.
It's good.

1514
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,510
My nails,
my hair,

1515
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,160
like it's like that.
In that same book,

1516
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:15,930
it talks about how bone marrow,
um,

1517
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,720
human brain,
uh,

1518
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,080
exponentially went up when humans 
started eating the bone marrow of animal

1519
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:24,280
because they couldn't have their own 
animals.

1520
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:26,950
They had to eat the leftover bone trash,
right.

1521
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,160
But that's actually where all the 
vitamins negotiating with.

1522
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:34,180
There's so many questions and so many 
theories about what caused the doubling 

1523
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:38,281
of the human brain size over a period of
2 million years is really a fascinating 

1524
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:41,530
subject because they just don't know.
There's all this speculation.

1525
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:44,400
There's something that was the,
um,

1526
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,440
the ability to throw the throwing arm 
because it's one of the most unique 

1527
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,461
aspects of a person.
There's no other animal that can take a 

1528
01:05:53,461 --> 01:05:55,660
rock and throw it with accuracy like a 
person can.

1529
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:58,840
So like ground nesting birds,
things along those lines.

1530
01:05:58,841 --> 01:06:03,841
That hand eye coordination and like a 
chimpanzee can throw something but 

1531
01:06:03,841 --> 01:06:03,841
doesn't mean it's going to hit the 
target.

1532
01:06:03,841 --> 01:06:06,850
It doesn't have the synapses,
it doesn't have the connections and it's

1533
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:10,300
mine that allow it to be like really 
accurate at distance.

1534
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,480
Like a person.
Like think about like a pitcher who 

1535
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,150
could throw a fastball.
How many feet is it to plate?

1536
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:19,830
Sixty to 62 feet.
I think that's also,

1537
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,270
we were evolved to see underwater,
right?

1538
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,330
Like fish as first started.
So we're actually,

1539
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:30,570
our vision is I wonder,
well if you ever read the theory,

1540
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:33,130
so please,
if you ever read the aquatic ape theory.

1541
01:06:33,131 --> 01:06:38,131
Nope.
The aquatic ape theory is really 

1542
01:06:38,131 --> 01:06:38,710
bizarre.
It's very controversial,

1543
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:43,711
but the idea is that human beings come 
out of the womb with so much body fat 

1544
01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:44,800
and we're so different than chimpanzees 
in that regard.

1545
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:47,590
Like a chimpanzee baby is like a 
chimpanzee adult.

1546
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:52,420
It's just little ds,
but a human babies filled with fat super

1547
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:55,300
fat.
Most species are born ready to go.

1548
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:57,970
Ours are born completely helpless,
just helpless,

1549
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:02,971
but fat like covered in fat.
And the idea is that we were in water 

1550
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:08,010
and that we developed and we possibly 
evolved around water to the point where 

1551
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,160
babies like if you throw a chimpanzee 
baby in the water,

1552
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,000
they fucking drown.

1553
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,430
They just the day breathe water and they
drown.

1554
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:20,550
You throw a human baby in the water.
The instinctively hold their breath 

1555
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:20,920
because they're basically fish until 
they're born.

1556
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:23,830
Like the Nirvana cover with the baby in 
the water.

1557
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:24,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

1558
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,940
Like when my kid,
my kids learned how to swim when they 

1559
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,101
were babies,
we taught them when they were really 

1560
01:07:32,101 --> 01:07:32,101
little,
we got them instruction.

1561
01:07:32,101 --> 01:07:33,580
But one of the things you realize like 
people,

1562
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,550
it's a very natural thing to hold your 
breath and go on to walk.

1563
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah,
it's totally instinctive.

1564
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:45,180
And so the aquatic eight theory 
theorized is that at one point in our 

1565
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:49,201
evolution we were primarily water bound 
and that may be we went into the water 

1566
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:54,421
to get away from predators or that maybe
we figured out a way to develop in the 

1567
01:07:54,421 --> 01:07:58,411
water as lower hominids do,
so no other animal holds their breath 

1568
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:01,690
either though about no other animal,
but I know that other primates don't.

1569
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:05,980
Other primates just fucking drowned.
Webbed at some point is,

1570
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,090
is that for swimming?
Didn't we have web?

1571
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,810
That's true because chimps don't.
I don't know if that's true.

1572
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,480
We might have.
I mean we certainly don't.

1573
01:08:13,481 --> 01:08:16,340
Some go wait,
but every now and then have webbed feet,

1574
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
but that could be just an aberration 
lip,

1575
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,010
cleft palate.
Yeah,

1576
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,450
that's true.
I don't know why you'd have a web.

1577
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:25,190
I mean maybe it,
maybe it makes sense.

1578
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:28,400
Here's a controversial thing,
we kind help you swim.

1579
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,230
Right?
But it didn't get in the way.

1580
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:33,050
If you wanted to like do shit,
it would.

1581
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,800
It'd be a problem.
But I mean they weren't texting,

1582
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:42,830
but again,
the way from your instagraming lot of 

1583
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,990
things is climb trees.
Oh yeah.

1584
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:49,310
Like stupid.
Well making tools.

1585
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:54,940
I think it maybe we'd get in the way it 
makes your fingers less agile but not 

1586
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:57,090
webbed hands.
Would it be helpful if he would help?

1587
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:01,520
Because our toes can't do anything or 
toes are useless for swimming flipper,

1588
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,800
but there's something about our fingers 
to.

1589
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:08,801
If you think about like the,
the dexterity and the control that we 

1590
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:11,831
have over our hands.
It's so unusual in comparison to any 

1591
01:09:11,831 --> 01:09:15,401
other animal and our fingers that when 
our fingers get all wet and what does 

1592
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:18,620
that wrinkly.

1593
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,850
There was this interesting study about 
how fingers after being in water for two

1594
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,940
hours could pick up more marbles then 
dry hands.

1595
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:33,990
Huh?
Which kind of means that we must have 

1596
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:36,880
needed to be in the water a lot.
Does that what it means or is it just a 

1597
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,820
side effect of just your fingers getting
wrinkly?

1598
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:43,060
Yeah,
but why would they get wrinkly if it 

1599
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:43,060
wasn't useful for something?
Or is that just why?

1600
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:48,050
Why do people get cancer?
Don't get me started on turnover.

1601
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:51,020
That is that.
Is there a benefit to that?

1602
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:56,210
How many things are a benefit of things 
are not designed to live past like 30,

1603
01:09:56,211 --> 01:10:00,470
right?
Well we definitely didn't live past 30 a

1604
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:02,150
long time ago.
Very often.

1605
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,020
True.
No,

1606
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,100
I like it.
I just,

1607
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I'm such a Klutz seat like I'm afraid.
I'm just thinking just like slapped his 

1608
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:12,650
fucking head.

1609
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:17,650
Just didn't happen.
Scientist think they've answered with 

1610
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:17,650
the skin on human fingers and toes 
shrivels up like an old proven.

1611
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:18,830
When we soak in the bath.
Laboratory tests confirmed that theory,

1612
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:23,831
that wrinkly fingers improve our grip on
wet or submerged objects working to 

1613
01:10:23,901 --> 01:10:27,650
channel away the water like a rain 
treads and car tires.

1614
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:31,940
You know why it makes sense because the 
rest of your skin doesn't do that.

1615
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:35,460
Like if your elbow got all wrinkly.
That's true.

1616
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:40,470
So a evolutionary neurobiologist and his
colleagues just that wrinkling being an 

1617
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,280
active process must have an evolutionary
function.

1618
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,320
The team also showed the pattern and 
wrinkling appeared to be optimized for 

1619
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,801
that.
Providing a drainage network that 

1620
01:10:50,801 --> 01:10:52,841
improved grip makes sense.
So maybe we were trying to get fish or 

1621
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:54,120
some shit rocks.
Well,

1622
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,850
you know,
it totally makes sense.

1623
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,350
It does.
It does.

1624
01:10:57,351 --> 01:11:02,351
That doesn't happen when you sweat.
Does it know mostly really just fuckers.

1625
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,450
I'm sure you've talked about it a lot.
Um,

1626
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:11,530
I think activity is good.
I think exercise is good and I think,

1627
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:13,380
you know,
those people,

1628
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:14,070
a lot of them are

1629
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:19,070
very fit and.
But I think that like a lot of things 

1630
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:23,070
when you take certain aspects of 
physical activity,

1631
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:28,071
like Steve Maxwell,
who's a good friend of mine and he's a 

1632
01:11:28,071 --> 01:11:31,290
strength and conditioning coach,
he said it best that physical fitness,

1633
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:36,470
like I'm lifting weights and engaging in
exercise activities he doesn't believe 

1634
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:43,101
is a sport in unto itself.
He thinks it's good at getting you 

1635
01:11:43,101 --> 01:11:47,100
strong for other sports.
Now when you turn into a sport like who 

1636
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,690
can do the most clean and presses,
who could do the most,

1637
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,470
uh,
you know,

1638
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:52,440
whatever,
a dead lifts in an hour,

1639
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:57,680
he doesn't think that that's healthy 
because in this is he's far more 

1640
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,300
qualified than I am to answer this.
So I'm using his rationale.

1641
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,480
He thinks that power lifting and 
bodybuilding movement or powerlifting 

1642
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,920
and weightlifting movements like dead 
lifts or like cleans and presses,

1643
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,590
you shouldn't do them for like sets of 
30 and 40 and 50,

1644
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:16,020
and having these competition to see who 
can do the most.

1645
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,910
He's like,
it's just not beneficial.

1646
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:23,090
It's not he,
he's of the school of thought that you 

1647
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:26,301
should like strength lifting exercises 
are strength producing exercises.

1648
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:30,450
Should it be done with a low repetitions
and you know,

1649
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:35,451
you should take breaks in between them.
And it's about building the physical 

1650
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:39,081
strength of your body.
It's not about performing them in a 

1651
01:12:39,081 --> 01:12:39,540
contest.
Now the crossfit people,

1652
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:44,810
I think if I could speak for them,
I think they think of it as a healthy 

1653
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:49,101
lifestyle and that this competition,
it makes them work harder and they all 

1654
01:12:49,101 --> 01:12:50,970
work out together and I definitely see 
their point.

1655
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,210
And if you follow crossfit people,
ms.one

1656
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:59,211
of the things about crossfit people that
they say like if someone's a crossfit 

1657
01:12:59,211 --> 01:13:00,750
and they're a Vegan,
what do they talk about first?

1658
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,570
Because.
Have you ever seen that?

1659
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,830
Because it's like a meme.
I think it was on like a,

1660
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:11,130
it was like a chalk board that was in 
front of a coffee shop.

1661
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,460
Yeah,
well it's,

1662
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:17,580
it's one of those things we get excited 
about it like vegans the most 

1663
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,811
proselytizing vegans and you'd talk to 
them like one of the things I've found 

1664
01:13:20,811 --> 01:13:21,330
because a lot of vegans get really upset
with me because I eat meat,

1665
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:26,570
but one of the things that I've found 
with a lot of them is that I'll go to 

1666
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:26,570
their instagram page after the shit on 
me and I say,

1667
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:29,580
I just found a bacon fucking sandwich 
that's four months old.

1668
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:31,020
So it means,
how long have you been a Vegan?

1669
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:33,630
I've been Vegan for three months.
It's three months.

1670
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:38,631
It's opened my eyes up.
I found my favorite person online the 

1671
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:38,631
other day.
He's a Vegan.

1672
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:41,650
Who believes the earth is flat.
It's a flat rate to eat.

1673
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,990
Um,
oh yeah.

1674
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:45,510
The flat earth,
flat earth people.

1675
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:49,590
There is a lot of people out there that 
believes the fucking earth is flat.

1676
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,920
They believe that it's all a hoax and 
then NASA is a hoax and that satellites 

1677
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,611
aren't real and that there is airplanes 
that are flying high and that's where 

1678
01:13:58,611 --> 01:14:00,360
we're getting like direct tv from and 
then it's all a giant,

1679
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:02,520
vast conspiracy.
And here's my favorite part.

1680
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:05,550
Gravity's not real and that the earth 
exists.

1681
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:10,551
The reason why we're,
we're staying put because 

1682
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:11,440
electromagnetism,
I mean

1683
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,970
I don't,
I'm not even going to.

1684
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:15,160
I don't even know how to respond to 
that.

1685
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:21,120
Just just be headings.
Think of how many astronomers and these 

1686
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:26,851
are the people having kids.
These people are just procreating all 

1687
01:14:26,851 --> 01:14:30,691
day with other people that they think 
all these people were in on it and they 

1688
01:14:30,691 --> 01:14:31,120
think that if you look at the horizon,
like there's,

1689
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:33,790
there's videos,
there's like a video that shows like the

1690
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:38,791
200 reasons why they can prove that the 
earth is flat and it's so fucking 

1691
01:14:38,791 --> 01:14:39,410
stupid.
Hurts my feelings.

1692
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:40,130
Really.
It,

1693
01:14:40,131 --> 01:14:41,110
it,
it makes me.

1694
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:44,470
So maybe it's my mind nightwatch or 
fight or flight thing,

1695
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:47,740
but like when I hear that I just feel 
like I'm in danger.

1696
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:53,130
But you are like,
it's just like a stupid people make me 

1697
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:55,810
feel unsafe.
What it is is there's a lot of religions

1698
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:58,590
out there.
Religion actually serves a.

1699
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,940
I understand the neurological purpose it
serves.

1700
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,940
Um,
but you know,

1701
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:05,310
don't be.

1702
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:08,100
What else can I say is there's 
religions.

1703
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:11,910
I mean the word religion,
let's just ditch it.

1704
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,470
Let's just.
What is the,

1705
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:18,680
what's the mental pathway that one's one
follows when they adhere to an ideology.

1706
01:15:19,531 --> 01:15:21,330
And I think we're all guilty of it to a 
certain extent.

1707
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:21,870
We all have them.

1708
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:26,930
We need.
And I think there needs to be something 

1709
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:29,851
in place.
It's like don't kill people like guilt 

1710
01:15:29,851 --> 01:15:31,210
and shame used to keep societies 
controlled and have a sense of order.

1711
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:36,490
Sure.
Guns and before prisons and before shit 

1712
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:36,970
was organized,
it was like God's going to get.

1713
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:42,010
You had to come up with something to 
keep people from raping each other and 

1714
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:42,850
murdering everyone.

1715
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,070
Right.
And at least stopping it.

1716
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,490
Don't do it again.
Yeah.

1717
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:47,060
Like,
you know,

1718
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:47,830
let's,
let's,

1719
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:52,831
let's nip this shit in the bud.
Let's figure out what the business 

1720
01:15:52,831 --> 01:15:52,831
opportunity.
It was like,

1721
01:15:52,831 --> 01:15:52,900
oh,
I can charge for this.

1722
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,060
Well,
you know,

1723
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,790
I mean,
look,

1724
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:00,940
there's,
there's countless examples of people 

1725
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:04,051
creating these behavior patterns that 
other folks are forced to follow and 

1726
01:16:04,051 --> 01:16:06,700
these ideologies,
they will.

1727
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,690
You see the way people think and I think
to a certain extent,

1728
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:14,680
there's a lot of like really what w,
what people called the regressive left.

1729
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,580
Like when people get mad at a white guy 
for wearing dreadlocks and they say this

1730
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:20,950
is cultural appropriation.
You taking black people's culture.

1731
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:26,130
Like that sort of same thing is a kin to
religious people that want to force 

1732
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:31,870
women to dress a certain way or want to 
force gay people to act a certain way.

1733
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:37,300
There's there's parts of certain 
ideologies that literally exists because

1734
01:16:37,721 --> 01:16:42,721
someone is trying to exert control over 
other people and they think they can 

1735
01:16:42,721 --> 01:16:45,970
because it's a rule too.
I try it like the like the other.

1736
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:51,030
It's a bad example that I used about the
dreadlocks because it's so fucking 

1737
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,310
stupid because first of all,
vikings wear dreadlocks.

1738
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:56,311
The Greeks had dread locks.
It's a white thing to a dirty hair 

1739
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:56,311
thing,
you know?

1740
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:56,850
It's just,
it's a scale.

1741
01:16:56,910 --> 01:17:00,610
Only had dreadlocks until it's so.
It's so stupid,

1742
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:03,970
but it's.
It's a new way that people can get upset

1743
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:08,320
at certain groups and the left like 
especially like what people.

1744
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,220
Like a lot of people get upset with that
term.

1745
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:15,220
The regressive left,
but it's a good term and the reason why 

1746
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:15,220
it's a good terms because they're,
first of all,

1747
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:19,151
they're attacking straight there all.
They're attacking white gay men now for 

1748
01:17:19,151 --> 01:17:23,201
having privileges that I've wrote this 
whole article about white gay privilege 

1749
01:17:23,201 --> 01:17:26,090
as opposed to black men and people of 
color who are gay,

1750
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:31,240
who don't get to experience the same 
freedom that white gay people do that 

1751
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,620
live in white neighborhoods and have,
you know,

1752
01:17:33,621 --> 01:17:35,420
adopt white babies.
It's easier for them.

1753
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,130
I mean it's,
it's attacking it,

1754
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:39,040
this constant,

1755
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,620
but we love.
I think it was you.

1756
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,460
We were texting about this.
People love being outrageous and I don't

1757
01:17:44,461 --> 01:17:49,461
know what the creational outrage.
They love complaint and I think it is a 

1758
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:52,491
form of bonding and I think it has 
helped people connect to each other and 

1759
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:52,491
like,
you know,

1760
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:53,640
organize and stuff.
People love being offended.

1761
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:56,040
They love being insulted.
They love,

1762
01:17:56,250 --> 01:18:01,250
they love racism because then they get 
to complain about it and began to take 

1763
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,761
the moral high ground,
get to be sanctimonious and they get to 

1764
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:04,761
be,
you know.

1765
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:04,761
Right.
And it's just like,

1766
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:08,370
I think that sort of thinking,
I don't want to call it religion because

1767
01:18:08,371 --> 01:18:10,980
I think it's a pattern and patterns of 
these ideologies.

1768
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:14,640
I think it's problematic when you label 
it like this is because of God,

1769
01:18:14,641 --> 01:18:15,690
this is,
but it's these,

1770
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:17,660
these patterns that people force their 
mind into,

1771
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,880
well some people force themselves into 
these patterns where everything is a 

1772
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,811
fucking conspiracy and that this is how 
you get to this like delusional state of

1773
01:18:27,451 --> 01:18:31,480
mind that would allow you to think that 
the earth is flat or that,

1774
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,990
you know,
the government's run by Reptilians.

1775
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:38,170
But to me intelligence is kind of 
someone being able to go,

1776
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,200
I think this is how it is or not,
or not being married to your idea.

1777
01:18:43,451 --> 01:18:45,820
Just like I could totally be fucking 
wrong.

1778
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,140
Like,
you know,

1779
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:49,390
I think it's just like what?
Like what is this?

1780
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:54,410
Like all my,
all my self esteem and identity is 

1781
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:58,050
linked to this lie.
It's like how sad and lonely is that 

1782
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:01,690
person that they need to attach to some 
idea that it's just,

1783
01:19:01,691 --> 01:19:06,691
it's just so odd to me.
I mean I think comedians are brains are 

1784
01:19:06,691 --> 01:19:09,391
a little.
We like we can go through our set and 

1785
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:12,040
say argue a point,
argue against our own point,

1786
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:17,041
go back on.
And then someone had called and it's 

1787
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:17,041
like,
well that's a good point.

1788
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:17,041
Like,
I mean,

1789
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:20,120
I,
I feel very lucky that we have brains 

1790
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:20,130
that are able to see everybody's side 
didn't.

1791
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,770
That's kind of what we do for a living,
but it's very shocking to me.

1792
01:19:23,771 --> 01:19:28,771
It seems so suffocating and isolating 
and weird to just be stuck on one thing.

1793
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:33,220
Sure.
It's easy to be.

1794
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:38,830
It's so common.
It's obviously easy to them is their 

1795
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:38,830
home,
you know.

1796
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:41,470
And if you think something and someone 
proves you wrong,

1797
01:19:41,471 --> 01:19:46,471
you will be angry and you will defend 
that original idea as if it's a part of 

1798
01:19:46,471 --> 01:19:46,471
someone's trying to steal.

1799
01:19:46,471 --> 01:19:47,890
Yes.
Why are you insulting me?

1800
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:49,460
I take from me.
Yes,

1801
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,200
it does.
People react to it.

1802
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:52,570
Like stealing.
That's so intense.

1803
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:55,290
That's when you can see right away that 
there's an issue.

1804
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:57,330
Yeah,
because people take it very personally.

1805
01:19:57,331 --> 01:19:59,250
If you don't share that belief

1806
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:03,290
are the ones that detached from their 
belief systems the fastest,

1807
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:05,750
like doctors and scientists like mirror 
neurons.

1808
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:07,920
It was all about mirror neurons like a 
couple of years ago.

1809
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:08,220
Right?

1810
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,670
And then they recently just debunk that 
theory and scientists.

1811
01:20:10,671 --> 01:20:11,220
I'd be like,
oops,

1812
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:12,920
we were wrong,
you know,

1813
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,940
you know,
that's what science is all.

1814
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:16,350
But I didn't mind who's a doctor.
I was like,

1815
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:16,980
because he's always like,
oh,

1816
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:18,300
and then I'm at my practice.
And I was like,

1817
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:20,520
do you guys feel like it's weird that 
you call it practice,

1818
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:22,630
you know,
do you want to call it good at,

1819
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:28,070
nailed it or the game time?
I'm at my game time championship game.

1820
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:29,670
And he's like,
no,

1821
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:34,671
it's called practice because the 
medicine is doing the best we can with 

1822
01:20:34,671 --> 01:20:34,671
what we know.
There's lots of we don't know.

1823
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:40,070
You know,
and in 10 years we're going to be doing 

1824
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,070
looking back.
And they were like,

1825
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,070
I can't believe you fucking did that.
That was dangerous.

1826
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:45,290
You know,
that's like what medicine and sciences 

1827
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:48,021
like you're wrong every five years 
there's a new fucking piece of 

1828
01:20:48,021 --> 01:20:48,021
information.

1829
01:20:48,021 --> 01:20:51,920
Did you see the latest thing that I 
tweeted yesterday that they've given 

1830
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,221
approval to people?
Do you stem cells to try to regenerate 

1831
01:20:55,221 --> 01:20:55,221
dead people's brains?
Love it.

1832
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:59,670
What was just so fucking horror moving?
I mean,

1833
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:04,671
that's what everybody was tweeting just 
zombies with is how it makes zombies to 

1834
01:21:04,671 --> 01:21:07,530
bring people back to life or put their 
old brain into a new person's body.

1835
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:08,700
I think.
Well,

1836
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:11,460
there's that too.
To find out.

1837
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:16,461
Here it is.
Biotech company granted ethical 

1838
01:21:16,461 --> 01:21:17,700
permission to attempt to use stem cells 
to reactivate the brains of the dead.

1839
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:20,100
Catch their killer or like.
No,

1840
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:22,350
I don't think so.
That'd be crazy to like,

1841
01:21:22,351 --> 01:21:23,010
hey,
who killed you?

1842
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:23,520
Alright,
you,

1843
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:28,740
but go back to sleep.
I want to see what I want to know what 

1844
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:28,740
the conversation was because the,
the.

1845
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,470
They've been granted ethical permission 
by an institutional review board.

1846
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,630
I didn't know there was an institutional
review board.

1847
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:36,900
That's not a real company in the US and 
in India,

1848
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:43,490
India,
they're going to take the brains of the 

1849
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:45,081
babies.
They smashed into a lot of alive people 

1850
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:48,381
in America.
There's a lot of people in dumb people.

1851
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:49,730
Yeah,
exactly.

1852
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:53,140
Use Twenty brain dead patients for what 
a shorted be.

1853
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:58,150
Okay.
Buried in comas or comatose or 

1854
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,520
something.
Look what they're calling it.

1855
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,740
The reanimate project.
Oh,

1856
01:22:01,741 --> 01:22:03,860
fucking Christ.
Sounds like an enema.

1857
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:04,920
What are you doing,
Jimmy?

1858
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,350
This is it.
Oh God.

1859
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:10,640
A second chance at life.
Oh my God.

1860
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:13,330
Magnolia.
It's also,

1861
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:18,380
by the way,
the worst thing about this is it's a 

1862
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:18,380
shitty website is terrible.
I'm not going to.

1863
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:22,730
I know if my.
If I had to do this on like a family 

1864
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,670
member on squarespace.
Totally guides.

1865
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,460
You've got like,
this is like comedy central site,

1866
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,620
proven scientific concepts.
This is insane.

1867
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:33,621
Exploring the potential of cutting edge 
biomedical technology for human neuro 

1868
01:22:33,621 --> 01:22:35,790
regeneration and how much,
how much,

1869
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,320
how much is a consummation neuro 
reanimation is.

1870
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:43,490
So when you see reanimator,
I think of that fucking movie reanimator

1871
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:48,500
movie where they brought the monsters 
that brought the people back to life 

1872
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,351
when they were monsters movies.
Reanimator like some mad scientist 

1873
01:22:51,351 --> 01:22:54,000
ladies.
Hold on.

1874
01:22:54,001 --> 01:22:55,440
Is it exciting?
Is it a private thing?

1875
01:22:55,441 --> 01:22:57,810
Like if I'm like,
I want to reanimated one invest.

1876
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,620
Yeah.
No,

1877
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
that's all you're doing right now.
I feel like you probably have some 

1878
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,000
fighter Fred's who could use this.
Oh,

1879
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,890
I know.
We both have a couple of my

1880
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:08,650
fucking inject some shit in there.
Fixing.

1881
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,320
Well,
Brian has never been hit.

1882
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:12,910
He doesn't even have any real excuses.
Oh,

1883
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:17,911
I'm sure his wife said I'm sure,
but he likes to box lately.

1884
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:21,280
Brian's into boxing and I think he is 
way worse for you,

1885
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:21,910
isn't it?
Well,

1886
01:23:21,911 --> 01:23:25,090
it's all bad for you in fucking soccer 
gives you brain damage.

1887
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:28,080
Your head's not to get as opposed to get
jostled around too much,

1888
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:33,450
but goes every direction except it goes 
right except down.

1889
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:38,440
I have a buddy of mine who's a professor
who's 49 or 50 and he kicked boxes.

1890
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:41,140
He's bars and I'm like,
but you know,

1891
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:43,720
you understand this like you're into 
this,

1892
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,760
you know,
he's a history professor.

1893
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:48,520
Like you understand that this is 
dangerous for your brand,

1894
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:53,521
but you get so much enjoyment out of the
thrill of being primal actually been in 

1895
01:23:53,521 --> 01:23:54,190
their sparring.

1896
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,820
Let me ask you a question.
Did we,

1897
01:23:56,821 --> 01:24:01,821
we didn't talk about this last time,
that calcium storico thing in Italy once

1898
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,420
they bare knuckle football with bare 
knuckle boxing.

1899
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,590
Insane.
Insane.

1900
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,830
So I was going to go to about that 
documentary.

1901
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,470
Yes.
And Pete Berg I think ended up making it

1902
01:24:12,471 --> 01:24:17,471
anyway,
but we were like just broken up and I'm 

1903
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:17,471
like,
why am I making a documentary with my ex

1904
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:19,370
boyfriend?
This is really self abusive,

1905
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:23,630
but it's apparently the,
the month that it happens,

1906
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:26,240
violence in the area goes down.
Of course.

1907
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:31,390
Yeah.
So there's something interesting about 

1908
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:32,801
these guys who want to go spar.
Like maybe they're sexually harassing 

1909
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,480
less women at work.
Maybe they're having less bar fights.

1910
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:38,540
This calcium storico.
So it was invented in the 16 hundreds to

1911
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:43,541
entertain kings.
It was stopped because so many people 

1912
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:44,170
were dying.
And then I want to say 1916,

1913
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,400
they brought it back.
They keep it low profile because so many

1914
01:24:46,401 --> 01:24:50,100
people get concussions in sick group 
kickboxing.

1915
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:54,410
I think 20 on 20 a the only rule is no 
two on one.

1916
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:58,020
These are grown men.
These are not young like athletes.

1917
01:24:58,021 --> 01:25:00,210
They're not professional athletes are 
butchers,

1918
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:00,920
they're lawyers.

1919
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:06,110
Whatever.
Exchange partners like guys just moved 

1920
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:06,180
and a new guy moved in and they just 
touched hands.

1921
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:11,660
Like one guy was duking it out with a 
guy and then for some reason they 

1922
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:11,660
changed it.

1923
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:11,660
Bare knuckle.
Yeah,

1924
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:16,530
it's also by by region,
so it's like neighborhoods against 

1925
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:20,551
neighborhoods.
So a lot of it's like fathers against 

1926
01:25:20,551 --> 01:25:20,551
sons,
brothers against brothers,

1927
01:25:20,551 --> 01:25:23,690
the change teammates,
like two guys were fighting and then 

1928
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:24,570
another guy steps in and takes the 
place.

1929
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:26,670
First of all,
these guys have dogs,

1930
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:26,900
good

1931
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,390
skills,
but it's no,

1932
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:32,840
these are not a guy just stepped in.
These professional athletes,

1933
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:36,500
these are literally guys that have other
jobs once a year.

1934
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:40,700
They just agree to fucking just gets 
pretty far.

1935
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:41,700
Which one is this?
What?

1936
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:43,400
What?
What number minute are you in?

1937
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:44,810
Oh,
well first.

1938
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:45,850
Okay.
So Paul to.

1939
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:50,910
Here's what you should see the ball.
It actually the goal is to get the ball 

1940
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:54,310
into the other side,
but when you dog shit skills and so 

1941
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:59,121
funny.
I've just allowed me that when the 

1942
01:25:59,121 --> 01:26:01,560
person scores they get so hit so hard 
that no one wants to go.

1943
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:04,130
Like everyone's

1944
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:04,370
like,
no,

1945
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:05,120
you do it.
You do it.

1946
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:06,720
Because as soon as you said

1947
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:11,740
score,
people just pummel you and then you see 

1948
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:11,740
these guys in the corners with 
stretchers.

1949
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,310
They just carry people off the field the
entire time.

1950
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,980
So this guy's holding this guy down.
She could grapple to.

1951
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,650
Yes.
The only rule you can bite,

1952
01:26:18,651 --> 01:26:20,780
you can kick the ball.
You can do anything.

1953
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:23,360
The only thing you can do is to,
on one,

1954
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:27,950
that's the only rule you can bite.
The only rule is no two on one.

1955
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:29,930
You can kick in the balls.
I'm sure.

1956
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:31,850
I mean maybe that's like a general.

1957
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:37,020
She is.
Two guys are the only two guys that are 

1958
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,031
humping were these two guys.
This guy's got this guy's back and 

1959
01:26:39,031 --> 01:26:41,150
there's a lot of people fucking lolly 
gagging cherry pickers.

1960
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:45,550
You fucking pussies.
Could they make get out there?

1961
01:26:45,551 --> 01:26:46,840
And they're like,
what the fuck am I doing?

1962
01:26:46,841 --> 01:26:49,810
I have a family.
Just knock these guys out one at a time.

1963
01:26:49,811 --> 01:26:51,800
What the fuck are we doing here?
Oh,

1964
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:53,080
that guy,
oh,

1965
01:26:53,081 --> 01:26:55,480
someone got smacked in the head.
He goes down,

1966
01:26:55,481 --> 01:26:59,640
he's got the ball and went down.
Then another guy took his place in.

1967
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,050
Guys just sort of avoiding the whole 
thing.

1968
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,670
This ball guy looks gay as fuck.
No,

1969
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:05,640
all.
Oh,

1970
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:07,150
see,
this is the guy gets knocked down.

1971
01:27:07,151 --> 01:27:08,590
But look,
as soon as he gets knocked down,

1972
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:13,600
another guy steps in and fights the guy 
that he was fighting before he got 

1973
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:13,690
knocked down.

1974
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,700
Oh,
what a bizarre,

1975
01:27:15,701 --> 01:27:20,701
stupid.
Turns into just like a melee of madness 

1976
01:27:20,701 --> 01:27:24,870
and it's just,
it's actually interesting to watch the 

1977
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:25,030
clusters happen.
Like the energy going into one place.

1978
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:26,680
Only one black guy.
Yeah,

1979
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:27,250
I know.

1980
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:29,470
That's why.
That's why it's so boring.

1981
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:38,120
Nobody wants.
And these guys,

1982
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:39,950
they're not professional professional 
athlete.

1983
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:41,760
It's like they trained for it.
Like it's,

1984
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,500
it's almost like a.
what's that thing the iron man?

1985
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:46,360
It's like a voluntary thing that they 
do.

1986
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:47,950
It's tradition.
If you do it,

1987
01:27:47,951 --> 01:27:49,750
if your dad did it.
Oh God.

1988
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,190
Yeah.
So stupid.

1989
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:54,580
And so rediculus.
Uh,

1990
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:59,340
but there's a lot of tradition in ed and
see everyone wears like joker uniform.

1991
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:04,360
Sure.
What does that guys that are humping 

1992
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:04,360
this still is bothered.
Just like,

1993
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,670
you guys got this guys back,
but he's not doing anything by the way.

1994
01:28:06,671 --> 01:28:11,671
You should go out there when you're the 
commentary where all the black people,

1995
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,230
this guy's fucking gay to more buckeyes,
getting happy now.

1996
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:20,740
They just took them off the bed.
Another like maybe just a Sicilian.

1997
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:23,220
This guy's annoying.
You've got dark shit skills.

1998
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:24,880
Well,
it just seems like a.

1999
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:28,420
You mean a few of these guys are pulling
people off going on.

2000
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,750
See the yellow guys in yellow.
That's when people get fucked up.

2001
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:37,010
Yeah.
They just get taken off the field and 

2002
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:37,010
then they have to play.
I think it's 2:20

2003
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:41,251
minute quarters and then the winter,
the winters have to play again the next 

2004
01:28:41,251 --> 01:28:45,720
day again that three days in a row,
the championship is four days later and 

2005
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,390
the winning team,
their prize is a cow.

2006
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:51,220
The Cow.
You get a cow,

2007
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,690
a cow,
get money.

2008
01:28:52,691 --> 01:28:54,730
You don't get endorsed.
The thing I like about it,

2009
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,130
that attracted me to it,
there's no endorsement deals.

2010
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:00,130
There's no.
Nothing's been promoted.

2011
01:29:00,131 --> 01:29:03,390
It's just people that want to fucking 
fight each other.

2012
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:05,620
What our stand is.
Where's the leg kicks?

2013
01:29:05,621 --> 01:29:07,270
Do you guys not understand about leg 
kicks?

2014
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,640
Italian.
Yeah,

2015
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:11,320
but they're not.
There's a few kicks being thrown,

2016
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:16,440
but Noah's Tony Lake kicks.
They're standing right in front of each 

2017
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:16,440
other,
but there's no take downs.

2018
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:20,220
So there's no takedown tabs.
It's just shitty boxing would the 

2019
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:20,220
occasional kick.

2020
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:24,210
It's this is.
It's basically just like a giant street 

2021
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:24,210
fight.

2022
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:28,150
Right?
But these guys have a little bit of 

2023
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:28,150
skill.
Like I'm looking at the way these.

2024
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:28,700
A lot of the legacy.
Here's a takedown look at this,

2025
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,400
but nothing happens so you can take a 
guy down.

2026
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,740
But look at the way these guys are like 
standing in front of each other.

2027
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,740
Like chicken.

2028
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,850
I think they probably get out there and 
like are like,

2029
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:38,050
wait,
what am I doing?

2030
01:29:38,051 --> 01:29:43,051
Let's just like pace around and see if 
we can just get through this 40 minutes 

2031
01:29:43,051 --> 01:29:43,051
without.

2032
01:29:43,051 --> 01:29:44,520
It's so weird because they just exchange
partners.

2033
01:29:44,521 --> 01:29:46,410
They move back and forth like they,
they,

2034
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,350
they square off and then they decide I 
don't want to fight you.

2035
01:29:49,351 --> 01:29:50,070
I'm going to fight your friend.

2036
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:55,090
Well,
it's so interesting because think about 

2037
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:55,090
it.
It's like these are not trained guys,

2038
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:55,760
but it's like if you put 20 people 
fighting,

2039
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:58,070
there's no pressure to do it right away,
you know?

2040
01:29:58,071 --> 01:30:00,350
It's like when do you decide it's time 
to take you to,

2041
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,120
you know,
oh Jesus,

2042
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,880
this is this guy.
But guy with the ball's going to go 

2043
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:07,880
through.
It's got to get through.

2044
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:12,311
Yeah.
And then they're just talking shit like 

2045
01:30:12,311 --> 01:30:12,311
that.

2046
01:30:12,311 --> 01:30:13,330
You look at that kick,
like how do you get.

2047
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,410
Does no one know how to kick?

2048
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,470
No.
I think most people,

2049
01:30:16,471 --> 01:30:17,910
unless they're in Thailand probably 
don't.

2050
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:25,260
I went and saw those fights in Thailand.
Doesn't want to watch those,

2051
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:30,680
but the point is there's less violence.
So maybe your friend who is getting 

2052
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,780
brain damage at his gym who has no 
business clown.

2053
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:35,820
Oh well Brian,
Brian,

2054
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:41,200
if Brian didn't get box,
I would be terrified at the things he 

2055
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:45,081
was doing in the city.
I think he needs to be in a gym getting 

2056
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:45,081
punched in the face a couple of hours a 
day.

2057
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:46,810
It's good for the people at crossfit.
No,

2058
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:49,010
I mean I'm not,
I'm not negative about crossfit,

2059
01:30:49,011 --> 01:30:51,360
but the kind of people who have to get 
that energy out,

2060
01:30:51,361 --> 01:30:54,900
I worry where that energy would go if 
they weren't getting it out in competing

2061
01:30:54,901 --> 01:30:56,520
or fighting or boxing or whatever.

2062
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,630
That's valid.
I think people feel better for sure when

2063
01:30:59,631 --> 01:31:04,631
they have that sort of a release and I 
think there's a cathartic release and 

2064
01:31:04,631 --> 01:31:08,261
any sort of like severe exertion,
but I think you can get the same 

2065
01:31:08,261 --> 01:31:09,470
cathartic release from Yoga.
I really do.

2066
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:15,040
I really do.
I mean it's not as this really exciting 

2067
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:15,040
for a man.
It's not as satisfying.

2068
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:15,310
It doesn't give you.
This sort of.

2069
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,180
Channeling doesn't give you the 
confidence.

2070
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:22,360
Like Jujitsu is my favorite because you 
so you can go full blast and you get 

2071
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:26,741
injured for sure,
but it's not the same kind of injuries 

2072
01:31:26,741 --> 01:31:27,990
that you get usually from like 
kickboxing and stuff like kickboxing.

2073
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:33,070
Sparring to me is the most problematic 
because I've seen how hard some people 

2074
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:37,331
can kick and I just know that if you zig
when you should've zagged and someone 

2075
01:31:37,331 --> 01:31:40,070
decides to kick you harder and that 
fucking Shin bounces off your head.

2076
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:42,260
No,
I just know what can be done.

2077
01:31:42,261 --> 01:31:44,660
I've seen too much.
So like when I see that I'm like,

2078
01:31:44,661 --> 01:31:48,680
you are your bms.
BMX jumping with no helmet.

2079
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,500
Okay.
Hopefully you're going to anything.

2080
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:51,590
The Jungle Java.
It's just,

2081
01:31:51,591 --> 01:31:53,270
it's not about if it's about when.

2082
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:55,450
Yeah,
well especially kickboxing.

2083
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:58,990
Kickboxing to me is like.
I feel like even boxing is more.

2084
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:04,260
As long as you're sparring with people 
who you know are not going to hit you 

2085
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:06,100
hard least you've got a little bit more 
control of this situation.

2086
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:11,330
I mean I dunno.
It really resonate or like was profound 

2087
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:14,100
to me when you said that you know,
you have to fall to know you're not your

2088
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:15,210
limitations,
but you know,

2089
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:20,250
don't know how far ramifications you 
have to understand that when I broke my 

2090
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:23,961
shoulder it changed my life.
Like it was actually something that 

2091
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:25,890
needed to happen because I've pushed 
myself way too hard.

2092
01:32:25,891 --> 01:32:30,891
I had no respect for my body.
Like I just routinely abused it with 

2093
01:32:30,891 --> 01:32:31,530
every,
in so many ways,

2094
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:33,690
uh,
the people I surrounded myself with,

2095
01:32:33,691 --> 01:32:35,130
the things I ate,
the way that I lived.

2096
01:32:35,131 --> 01:32:40,020
I didn't sleep and it was like I needed 
to be proven the fragility of my body.

2097
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,460
Yeah.
Vulnerability.

2098
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,600
Yeah,
totally.

2099
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:43,620
Yeah.
And being able to go,

2100
01:32:43,621 --> 01:32:44,250
you know what?
No,

2101
01:32:44,251 --> 01:32:49,251
I don't think so.
I think I'm going to try to think like 

2102
01:32:49,251 --> 01:32:50,760
more than two hours ahead right now and 
not do that dangerous thing.

2103
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:55,900
Well,
think about your body as if this 

2104
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,090
longterm thing and people have given me 
a hard time about that too.

2105
01:32:56,091 --> 01:32:58,250
Like go,
like especially like lifting weights.

2106
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:00,140
I've been wondering why your body is so 
fucked up.

2107
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:02,150
Like [inaudible].
I'll put like a video on instagram of me

2108
01:33:02,151 --> 01:33:07,151
working out my trainer,
but that the only way you can keep your 

2109
01:33:07,151 --> 01:33:08,730
body from getting into sounds so 
counterintuitive.

2110
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:13,900
The only way that you can prevent 
certain injuries is by making your body 

2111
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:14,290
strong.
Of course,

2112
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:17,380
only way you can make your body strong 
as you gotta lift heavy thing.

2113
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:22,500
I'm also.
Do you have any interest or an 

2114
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,590
hypermobility?
Yes.

2115
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:25,060
Hypermobile.
Hypermobile,

2116
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:27,820
which I didn't know,
which means I lift things.

2117
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:30,370
Everything from a weight to a Coffee Cup
with my joints,

2118
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:34,290
not my muscles.
So I was using the term wrong then.

2119
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,610
I know maybe I am too,
but it's um,

2120
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,890
so western European trash,
which is,

2121
01:33:38,891 --> 01:33:41,470
I am basically just like alcoholics with
joint problems,

2122
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:45,520
like a lot of western European genetics 
means you're hyper mobile,

2123
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,320
which is useful.
You're picking things up,

2124
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:52,570
putting a lot of strain on your joints.
So when I pick something up,

2125
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:57,660
it's my knees and my hips and my lower 
back instead of my thigh muscles and my 

2126
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:57,850
glue.

2127
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:03,090
Well,
that's one of the best things about 

2128
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:03,090
Kettlebell training in my opinion,
is that they're so awkward,

2129
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:05,410
but it forces you to understand how to 
use your body as a unit.

2130
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:10,650
There's a lot of people that do 
bodybuilding type workouts and the 

2131
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:11,650
isolation exercises,
although they make your muscles bigger.

2132
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:16,690
Yeah.
They don't allow your body to 

2133
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:17,430
synchronize and use itself as one 
individual.

2134
01:34:17,431 --> 01:34:17,590
Yeah.

2135
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:22,860
Interesting.
That's how you get non collision 

2136
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:25,531
injuries.
Like when you hear about people who are 

2137
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:25,531
50 and they're like,
I sneezed and threw my back out.

2138
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:29,341
That's because they've been putting 
pressure on their joints instead of 

2139
01:34:29,341 --> 01:34:30,190
their muscles for the longest time.
And I didn't have an ass.

2140
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:35,460
Like I never use my glutes just walking 
around and walking upstairs and picking 

2141
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:36,630
things up and whatever.
And uh,

2142
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:40,150
and then I had to like relearn how to 
walk and Shit.

2143
01:34:40,151 --> 01:34:45,151
I had to go to this fucking police thing
and like it was so fucking boring.

2144
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:50,140
This was like three years ago was a 
fucking nightmare.

2145
01:34:50,141 --> 01:34:53,290
Like literally,
you know how to walk.

2146
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:57,180
You need to relearn how to walk and 
you're like sitting in bed.

2147
01:34:57,181 --> 01:34:57,890
You can't sleep.
Fuck,

2148
01:34:57,891 --> 01:34:57,980
I

2149
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,720
need to learn how to walk.
I'm going to do a documentary.

2150
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,760
I'm going to write a book about how to 
walk.

2151
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:03,230
I'm going to learn how to walk.
I'm going to get.

2152
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,240
I'm going to get fucking awesome it 
learning how to walk.

2153
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,070
I'm going to teach people how to walk.
That's what I do.

2154
01:35:07,071 --> 01:35:08,720
I'm going to go to China and teach kids 
how to walk.

2155
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:12,690
By the way,
that's my schedule for tomorrow.

2156
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,300
Thanks.
Thanks for reminding me.

2157
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:16,700
I mean you are one of those people,
like when you call me,

2158
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:20,750
I say I'm doing a documentary on fucking
horseshit.

2159
01:35:20,751 --> 01:35:22,880
You walked over to them and if they lied
to you,

2160
01:35:22,881 --> 01:35:27,881
I know.
We don't know what it's like to be a 

2161
01:35:27,881 --> 01:35:28,780
woman.
We believe lies,

2162
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,470
so it's shit.
Yeah,

2163
01:35:33,471 --> 01:35:35,120
the world's flat.
Your Dick is huge.

2164
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,840
There's a lot of lines going around it.
But someone telling you.

2165
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:43,850
Right.
I was in a writers room once and I was 

2166
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:43,850
like,
thinking of this story where this,

2167
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:46,320
these characters were going to have sex,
but then they didn't and I was like,

2168
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:47,310
oh,
I have an idea.

2169
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:49,830
What if the guy is allergic to 
spermicide?

2170
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:51,330
And everyone was like,
oh God.

2171
01:35:51,331 --> 01:35:53,130
I was like,
you know how like some guys are allergic

2172
01:35:53,131 --> 01:35:55,020
to spermicide so they can't use condoms.

2173
01:35:56,610 --> 01:36:01,610
Yeah.
It's like half of the guys I've dated 

2174
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:01,610
guys,

2175
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:07,140
I was like,
they can't use condoms because there's 

2176
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:07,140
so allergic to it.
They were like,

2177
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:10,770
you are the dumbest.
I was literally like at,

2178
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:13,060
as I was saying,
and I was like,

2179
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:18,150
oh wow.
Well I believe that some women are 

2180
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:18,150
allergic to spermicide.
Not only that,

2181
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:21,600
but I've heard that some women are 
actually allergic to different partners.

2182
01:36:21,601 --> 01:36:23,750
Sperm.
Interesting.

2183
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:29,190
I think that's true.
Please Google sperm fertilizing eggs 

2184
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:34,670
frozen.
Then it's really bad reaction to our 

2185
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:35,500
cooler.
Something frozen eggs are fucking living

2186
01:36:35,501 --> 01:36:39,340
an amazing life in Hermosa beach.
They have a great view.

2187
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:40,330
It'll a fault.
Yeah.

2188
01:36:40,331 --> 01:36:40,840
Like,
hey,

2189
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:43,840
keep them cold.
I guess it's Cryo freeze.

2190
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,390
I should probably just keep them down.
What if the power goes out?

2191
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,970
I think about that all the time.
Greg goes down.

2192
01:36:48,971 --> 01:36:50,530
Is that one of the things in the middle 
of the night that.

2193
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:55,531
No,
they explained to me the generators and 

2194
01:36:55,531 --> 01:36:55,531
all this stuff.

2195
01:36:55,531 --> 01:36:55,531
All I ever think about is when I'm in 
hospitals.

2196
01:36:55,531 --> 01:36:59,190
What if the fucking power goes out,
know 33 and how many eggs did you store?

2197
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:01,510
Where your eggs are still good?
Yeah,

2198
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:02,380
they're really good.
Good.

2199
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:07,530
For like another six years.
I just see an allergy ruined my 

2200
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,470
marriage.
Holy Shit.

2201
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:13,620
Fourteen months after we were married,
I was diagnosed with humans seminal 

2202
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,100
plasma hypersensitivity and allergy to 
seaman.

2203
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:16,780
I'm taking,
oh my God,

2204
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:21,070
I met Simon at a girlfriend's wedding 
name changed to predict identity.

2205
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,250
The faithful day changed my life in more
ways than I could've ever imagined.

2206
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:29,460
So I wonder if she's allergic to some 
dudes loads and not everyone's like,

2207
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:34,950
where is it in her?
Is the allergy happening in her vagina 

2208
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:37,420
or in her face?
I just the that someone's wondering,

2209
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,660
but I just am curious where like a her 
throat itchy.

2210
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:43,160
Well,
I wonder like what allergies guys have.

2211
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:45,820
Are some guys allergic to eating pussy?
Okay.

2212
01:37:45,821 --> 01:37:48,550
Sperm analogy sometimes seem analogy.
Seminal.

2213
01:37:48,551 --> 01:37:51,670
Plasma hypersensitivity is a rare 
allergic reaction to proteins.

2214
01:37:51,671 --> 01:37:55,740
Founded a man's semen mostly affects 
women in the vaginal area.

2215
01:37:55,741 --> 01:37:56,700
Oh,
that's not good.

2216
01:37:57,810 --> 01:38:02,810
Pain.
Itching and a burning sensation of 

2217
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:02,810
vaginal area.
Oh,

2218
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:02,810
that's awful.
Yeah,

2219
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:02,810
it sounds not good.
Oh,

2220
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:04,320
that's a bummer.
Mostly affects women.

2221
01:38:04,321 --> 01:38:06,420
Why?
Because mostly women catch loads.

2222
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:10,410
Let me ask you something.
Well,

2223
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:15,450
I'm always like,
what's the evolutionary purpose of 

2224
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:15,450
something?
I mean,

2225
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:15,450
there's got to be an evolutionary 
purpose to every allergy.

2226
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:17,850
Is it?
There's just eliminate people.

2227
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:18,870
Well,
that's what I'm saying.

2228
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:23,560
Maybe evolution doesn't want this woman 
to procreate that way.

2229
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:28,470
It's random mutations and adaptations to
environmental changes.

2230
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,420
It's what if this,
if,

2231
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,580
if the,
uh,

2232
01:38:32,581 --> 01:38:33,320
yeah,
hold on.

2233
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:36,210
They don't prove beneficial sample.
Right?

2234
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:37,500
So,
pheromones,

2235
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,070
if you're a fairmont smell good,
that means we should procreate.

2236
01:38:40,071 --> 01:38:45,071
Right?
And if they smell bad it means we're 

2237
01:38:45,071 --> 01:38:45,071
probably related somehow.
That's when.

2238
01:38:45,071 --> 01:38:48,510
So to have a vagina flare up when sperm 
goes in,

2239
01:38:48,511 --> 01:38:51,720
it is that nature's way of being like,
this woman has garbage.

2240
01:38:51,721 --> 01:38:56,721
Genetics may be the dude has weak loads.
Maybe if a man has some like fucking 

2241
01:38:56,721 --> 01:38:58,950
stout loads get in there and your 
vagina.

2242
01:38:58,951 --> 01:38:59,960
But like I'll tell you this.

2243
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:01,310
This is good.
This is good.

2244
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:03,660
Yeah.
Maybe it's just bad loads,

2245
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:07,550
but that's your area.
I don't know.

2246
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:11,440
I'm going to not cast.
Was it Chris Ryan that was explained,

2247
01:39:11,441 --> 01:39:14,920
explaining,
write a book called about loads slow.

2248
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:17,140
It's going to be my new podcast forward 
by Brian.

2249
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:20,340
I'm just going to talk about load.
Slept three hours twice a week,

2250
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:25,920
so I'm really interested in loans.
We shouldn't have to do my first sexing 

2251
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:30,810
actual sex next week.
Yeah.

2252
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,300
And more.
And let her literally.

2253
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,500
There's so much time and energy has gone
into.

2254
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:36,510
Where does his Dick go?
Where does,

2255
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:40,370
where does everything go?
When is it for a t shirt?

2256
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:45,750
It's very shallow.
So it's going to be a lot of people in 

2257
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:45,750
the set.
Yeah,

2258
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:47,850
I mean they'll probably minimize 
unnecessary people that day.

2259
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:52,851
Like you got a dude who was friends with
who did a sexy with a girl and they're 

2260
01:39:53,041 --> 01:39:58,041
making out and she goes,
if you want you could go ahead and fuck 

2261
01:39:58,041 --> 01:39:58,041
me.

2262
01:39:58,041 --> 01:39:58,041
And he was like,
nope.

2263
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:03,390
It was like the moment you said that,
the type of girl that says like,

2264
01:40:03,391 --> 01:40:07,170
if you could fuck me a b movie,
it wasn't even a b movie,

2265
01:40:07,171 --> 01:40:12,171
you know,
it's like some no name nonsense 

2266
01:40:12,171 --> 01:40:12,171
production.
And they were,

2267
01:40:12,171 --> 01:40:12,171
you know,
making out.

2268
01:40:12,171 --> 01:40:13,170
And she just said,
you can go ahead and fuck.

2269
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,270
He's more.
He likes them to say no more.

2270
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,360
Return on down.
He can fuck me,

2271
01:40:18,361 --> 01:40:19,860
please let me.
Well,

2272
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:24,861
I bet he was probably terrified of not 
being able to get it up in front of all 

2273
01:40:24,861 --> 01:40:24,861
those peoples.
Well,

2274
01:40:24,861 --> 01:40:24,861
well,
yeah,

2275
01:40:24,861 --> 01:40:29,691
that's.
I mean we were kind of trying to figure 

2276
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:29,691
it out because we're like,
okay,

2277
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:31,830
there's going to be an erection.
Do we just might not be.

2278
01:40:31,831 --> 01:40:36,831
You say there's going to be,
but there might not be an erection if 

2279
01:40:36,831 --> 01:40:39,351
there's not one job,
I will be crying hysterically that he 

2280
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:43,170
will get loud because guys are into that
during the crying.

2281
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2282
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:48,380
I did an episode with Chris about this.
Um,

2283
01:40:48,381 --> 01:40:53,381
one time he was crying and the guy I was
trying to interaction like red flag you 

2284
01:40:55,211 --> 01:41:00,211
like week with sad women.
There are some people that have a hard 

2285
01:41:00,211 --> 01:41:04,030
time with someone who is not insecure.
They're insecure.

2286
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,070
So if they're insecure and the woman is 
confident,

2287
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:11,100
they panic and then they could get,
they could have a problem getting an 

2288
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,491
erection.
But if the woman like all of a sudden 

2289
01:41:14,491 --> 01:41:16,760
needs comforting and she's insecure,
then they assume this position.

2290
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,640
Oh yeah.
Interesting.

2291
01:41:18,641 --> 01:41:20,620
So I should be brilliant.
Secure.

2292
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:22,700
I will be anyway.
Well,

2293
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:27,940
I don't know.
Like what is like I was thinking about 

2294
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:31,111
this the other day,
there's two voices that are just 

2295
01:41:31,111 --> 01:41:32,980
absolute bullshit that just don't work,
but we,

2296
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:36,260
we know them as archetypes and one of 
them is like,

2297
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:41,610
one of them is like the spooky voice,
like no one's scared of this spooky and 

2298
01:41:41,610 --> 01:41:45,760
no ones.
And then the sexy girl call one 800,

2299
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:48,400
suck my pussy.
You know what I mean?

2300
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:49,630
Like that.
Fuck,

2301
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:51,340
please don't ever stop.
Got Anyone.

2302
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,120
Everyone's different.
But,

2303
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,340
but you know what I'm saying?
It's like,

2304
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:02,450
you know,
hey boys doing that doesn't work on 

2305
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,890
anybody can do it.
So men can.

2306
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:11,100
Men can pretend to be what I mean.
Like I don't know any women who were 

2307
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:11,100
like,
well,

2308
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:11,620
you know what I mean,
if you're just seeing those commercials,

2309
01:42:11,621 --> 01:42:15,940
those late night phone call,
commercial call,

2310
01:42:15,941 --> 01:42:20,941
late night commercials at 2:00
AM or not guys like you that are guys 

2311
01:42:20,941 --> 01:42:25,291
who are probably more susceptive who are
Beta males who need someone even more 

2312
01:42:25,291 --> 01:42:28,381
Beta than them.
So maybe that's why they have to be 

2313
01:42:28,381 --> 01:42:29,170
like,
but it's the naughty girl.

2314
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:33,730
Do you want to call Ashley Madison?
Come?

2315
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:35,200
Yeah.
It's like,

2316
01:42:35,201 --> 01:42:37,010
why are you whispering?
She wanted to be not.

2317
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:42,120
Well,
maybe it's because they know that the 

2318
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:43,801
wife's in the next room and friend.
I'm like,

2319
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:51,660
Hey,
just call fucking nine already.

2320
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:53,850
That's not sexy.

2321
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:56,950
Not Suck my pussy.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2322
01:42:56,951 --> 01:42:59,590
Why didn't you call me?
He was like other archetypes,

2323
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:00,520
right?
Like the Strip club,

2324
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:02,920
Dj voice,
the top 40 Dj voice,

2325
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:05,650
those archives,
the politician voice.

2326
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,800
That's an archetype,
right?

2327
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,850
Annoying wife.
Yes.

2328
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,800
Voice.
Sure.

2329
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:15,870
I find myself in.
I stopped doing this because I realized 

2330
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:18,391
I'm exacerbating the problem.
I get very triggered and annoyed by 

2331
01:43:18,391 --> 01:43:21,301
stereotypes.
Like the stereotype that guys are dumb 

2332
01:43:21,301 --> 01:43:21,770
really annoys me and I dumb.
No,

2333
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:25,000
I don't think guys are dumb.
Guys are you're designed to only.

2334
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,660
Most people are.
No,

2335
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:28,750
I just mean like in terms of why don't 
you remember my friend Audrey's name.

2336
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:33,751
You've met her three times.
It's like guys are only really 

2337
01:43:33,751 --> 01:43:35,641
remembered designed to remember things 
if there's some kind of threat attached 

2338
01:43:35,641 --> 01:43:38,821
to it and it's just your brains are 
because like we're designed to sort of 

2339
01:43:38,821 --> 01:43:41,470
in a team way for me to be hypervigilant
and be like,

2340
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:46,560
there's a fucking lion and you go break 
down everything to like some primitive 

2341
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,180
tribe that is always think there.

2342
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:54,370
People find things memorable because 
they're interesting and they're 

2343
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:55,880
fascinating people.
Things that are totally unthreatened.

2344
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:57,830
Is Andrea interesting or fascinating 
too?

2345
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:58,540
I don't know.
Algeria,

2346
01:43:58,541 --> 01:44:00,830
so maybe she is.
She's cool as fuck.

2347
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,810
Yeah.
Maybe Dr Audrey Ph day,

2348
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:07,010
but I just mean like some benign friend 
of your girl or whatever.

2349
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:09,270
Um,
and got.

2350
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:13,490
I mean and then because it's also,
that's something that I love about my,

2351
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,170
a man.
Like if you're fixing something,

2352
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:16,850
I want you to only be focusing on that.
Guys.

2353
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:19,010
Don't multitask in the same way.
You know?

2354
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:24,220
I just think they call guys dumb.
It's just as glorifying a neurotic 

2355
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:24,830
multitasking,
you know,

2356
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:28,160
overworked or glorification of busy 
type.

2357
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:30,870
That's the new thing.
Guys that are just like simple.

2358
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:31,700
You know,
I just.

2359
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:36,080
People are so varied though I'm really 
more hesitant to generalize.

2360
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:41,140
The older men or women are crazy.
Men are stupid.

2361
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:44,870
That thing is just to me,
so I'm general.

2362
01:44:44,871 --> 01:44:49,871
It's just a generalization that I think 
is really not helpful at all and 

2363
01:44:50,961 --> 01:44:54,410
annoying.
It makes people comfort.

2364
01:44:54,411 --> 01:44:56,910
It gives them comfort to sort of 
classify people.

2365
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:57,380
Totally.
Yeah.

2366
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,420
Like you don't have to look at it.
Oh,

2367
01:44:59,421 --> 01:45:01,670
what happened with Debbie?
She's a crazy bitch.

2368
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:03,950
It's like,
it's easy to say she's a crazy bitch.

2369
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:05,180
Instead of say,
well,

2370
01:45:05,181 --> 01:45:10,181
I was raised kind of fucked up,
but I really don't like her because she 

2371
01:45:10,181 --> 01:45:14,550
didn't,
she wasn't heard his child secure 

2372
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:14,570
stronger than I did and it's just,
it's got.

2373
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:19,860
That'd be the dominant one.
She's smarter than me on this too much 

2374
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:20,270
already.
Why did we get on that topic?

2375
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:21,470
There was something.
Oh,

2376
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:24,920
the Beta males loads.
We're talking about stop loads coming in

2377
01:45:24,921 --> 01:45:27,260
hot load stone.
It was something about the Beta males.

2378
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:30,870
Uh Oh.
And the archetypes like dump because Oh,

2379
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:32,390
this is it.
I've found in my stand up,

2380
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:33,420
I'd be like into.
My boyfriend was like,

2381
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,250
Ooh,
what are you doing?

2382
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:35,990
And I'm like,
guys don't sound like that.

2383
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,930
What am I doing?
You know?

2384
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:43,010
But it's funny.
Point taken.

2385
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,520
Nevermind it.
Sometimes I'll put a girl in my acts.

2386
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:46,920
I'd be like,
yeah,

2387
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:51,910
oh my God,

2388
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:56,960
I know that girl exists.

2389
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:01,390
Yay.

2390
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:08,920
I just feel like a prime.
Most species under attack,

2391
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:09,140
right?

2392
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:14,250
So know how to walk.
I pick things up with my joints,

2393
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,630
knees,
and my back is just gonna like break and

2394
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:27,040
have extra bone in my foot.
Hey God,

2395
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:29,790
I'm allergic to that and get it away 
from me,

2396
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:33,850
from my frozen eggs.

2397
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:41,100
Freeze them with my eggs.
I side just in case you can combine it.

2398
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:43,600
Some stories that all you need is come 
and eggs.

2399
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:47,090
You want to freeze an embryo,
which means the,

2400
01:46:47,290 --> 01:46:48,880
uh,
the sperm fertilize.

2401
01:46:48,881 --> 01:46:49,320
Say,
Hey Joe,

2402
01:46:49,321 --> 01:46:50,250
can I ask some of your sperm,

2403
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:55,250
fertilize my,
then put it in the freezer and then put 

2404
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:55,250
it back in.
My body seems so creepy.

2405
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:59,361
Zombie demands total science fiction 
embryo gets frozen and then you could 

2406
01:46:59,431 --> 01:47:02,880
turn that into life.
But it only healthy choice dinner.

2407
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:03,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

2408
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:05,490
But it only works like,
okay.

2409
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:08,190
So an embryo will eventually become a 
human being,

2410
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:11,100
so that little embryo was already 
fertilizes.

2411
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:13,980
The egg gets fertilized and you could 
freeze that,

2412
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:16,310
but you can't freeze a 13 year old.
Nope.

2413
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:22,310
No.
What I'm saying know like there's a 

2414
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:24,141
cutoff period.
Should we could at some point just not 

2415
01:47:24,141 --> 01:47:24,141
yet.
I think we could.

2416
01:47:24,141 --> 01:47:24,510
Yeah,
I think it's going to happen.

2417
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:29,720
I think these fucking [inaudible] guys,
these assholes that are shooting stem 

2418
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,160
cells and the DM people's heads,
those fuckers

2419
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:35,280
look lot of alive people who need that.
But um,

2420
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,730
yeah,
that is a crime I,

2421
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:41,160
I mean I imagined it because it doesn't 
have a brain and blood.

2422
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:42,730
It doesn't have to be warm.
Like

2423
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:47,900
Maria's not be warm.
Humans I guess have to a certain body 

2424
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:47,900
temperature.
I mean,

2425
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:48,570
I mean that's like some Austin powers 
shit,

2426
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:51,900
but even a sell to me,
I mean it was an individual cell.

2427
01:47:51,901 --> 01:47:56,901
Like if the egg has been fertilized and 
the creative one sell the idea that you 

2428
01:47:56,901 --> 01:48:01,011
could freeze that fucking cell before it
divides and becomes a full on human 

2429
01:48:01,011 --> 01:48:04,611
being.
The idea that you could freeze that one 

2430
01:48:04,611 --> 01:48:04,611
cell and then regenerate it.

2431
01:48:04,611 --> 01:48:06,640
That was crazy.
Honestly,

2432
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:09,580
I don't know how people do like,
it's so.

2433
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:11,830
I guess that's why I tried to read so 
much yet because I'm like,

2434
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:16,860
I don't understand how I can't even 
understand what these people are doing 

2435
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:16,860
and I'm not even doing it.

2436
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:17,190
Well,
it's so standard today too.

2437
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:22,330
I mean,
which is so really fascinating because 

2438
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:23,930
if you brought this concept to someone 
200 years ago or even 100 years ago,

2439
01:48:23,931 --> 01:48:25,280
they think you're out of your fucking 
mind,

2440
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,650
but it's,
it sounds fucking crazy.

2441
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:31,180
It does sound like I'm sucking them out 
of your fucking over.

2442
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,060
I'm like,
okay.

2443
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:33,830
Do you remember John and Kate plus 
eight?

2444
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:36,590
Of course.
Remember that crazy lady.

2445
01:48:36,591 --> 01:48:41,591
They shot the fucking those chemicals 
inside of her body to make her more 

2446
01:48:41,591 --> 01:48:44,140
fertile and she gave birth to six kids.
Yeah.

2447
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,730
Yes.
OCTOMOM.

2448
01:48:46,970 --> 01:48:48,050
Yeah.
What the fuck?

2449
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:53,070
Optima optima have a lot of money.
I think the only reason I remember that 

2450
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:54,920
because people on twitter say I looked 
like her,

2451
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,110
uh,
when they're just being mean.

2452
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:00,500
But uh,
yeah,

2453
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:01,780
it's,
I mean it's a,

2454
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:04,220
it I've never felt like more of a 
science project,

2455
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:09,280
you know,
it's like the human body that kind of a 

2456
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,201
miracle.
But when he's this sort of intersection 

2457
01:49:11,201 --> 01:49:13,460
between technology and life or like 
mother nature is so weird.

2458
01:49:13,461 --> 01:49:18,461
It's like he's in there and he's like 
with a wand and it says this with the 

2459
01:49:18,461 --> 01:49:20,900
soul and now you're going and what,
uh,

2460
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:21,790
the,
yeah,

2461
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:24,620
it's not a very sexy or romantic 
process.

2462
01:49:24,621 --> 01:49:29,621
It's very clinical sort of rough and 
he's and in my ovaries are on a high def

2463
01:49:30,081 --> 01:49:33,170
television.
It's just like that for those two things

2464
01:49:33,171 --> 01:49:38,171
to be in this like intersect.
It's just so weird and you're just 

2465
01:49:38,171 --> 01:49:39,680
looking at all your follicles.
And I was convinced for the first couple

2466
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:41,720
of sessions that it was just like a 
feed,

2467
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:43,820
like everyone saw the same feed because 
I was like,

2468
01:49:43,821 --> 01:49:46,640
there's just no way you can see inside 
my body.

2469
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:47,920
Like,
I mean

2470
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,490
I just,
I like,

2471
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:52,150
this is just a video tape you put in.
Everybody comes in.

2472
01:49:52,151 --> 01:49:57,151
It's the same thing.
There's just no way you can see inside 

2473
01:49:57,151 --> 01:49:59,470
my body is dark on the inside obviously.
Like I intellectually,

2474
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:02,560
I can't fathom it.
Like it's just to,

2475
01:50:02,561 --> 01:50:03,190
um,
to have to.

2476
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,610
Obviously everybody is.
I think it seems like all my follicles,

2477
01:50:06,611 --> 01:50:07,970
he's like,
this one's a different size.

2478
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:13,170
I'm like,
how the fuck do you know that it looks 

2479
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:13,170
like a haunted house to me.
I can't understand anything.

2480
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:17,730
It looks like paranormal activity.
I mean it looks like a fucking 

2481
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:17,730
nightmare.
And uh,

2482
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:19,220
and then I go and then I'm sure enough 
you get like four.

2483
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:21,460
I looked like I was like four or five 
months pregnant,

2484
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:26,940
you know,
and I'm doing these shots every day and 

2485
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:26,940
I'm like,
it was like,

2486
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:30,480
this is so fucking crazy.
So it makes your stomach stick out more 

2487
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,700
because I had 18 big swollen ecs.

2488
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,680
Yeah,
I have a picture of it somewhere.

2489
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:38,020
I'll send it to you and I look like five
months pregnant and it's just like,

2490
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:38,900
Whoa,
you know,

2491
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:41,920
it's usually caused for our alarm.
So to spend money to look like that.

2492
01:50:41,921 --> 01:50:42,700
And then,
uh,

2493
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
yeah.
And then you go in and they suck them 

2494
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,000
all out.
Now what made you decide to do that?

2495
01:50:48,370 --> 01:50:50,620
You know,
like one day have a kid,

2496
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:54,220
I am going to one day have a kid.
What he said to me was this,

2497
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,360
he was like,
look,

2498
01:50:55,930 --> 01:50:58,300
because I was like,
I know my next year and a half,

2499
01:50:58,301 --> 01:51:03,301
two years it's gonna be a little bit 
hectic and I'm probably not going to 

2500
01:51:03,301 --> 01:51:03,301
get.
He was like,

2501
01:51:03,301 --> 01:51:03,301
this might not be for your first or 
second kid.

2502
01:51:03,301 --> 01:51:06,460
It could be a for your fourth.
Like when you're 44 and you're like,

2503
01:51:06,461 --> 01:51:07,330
you don't have to have one more.

2504
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:09,640
Or like I'm going to have a surrogate,
you know?

2505
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:14,670
Oh Jesus.
It was literally just like an insurance 

2506
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:14,950
policy.
A adopting.

2507
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:17,350
It depends.
So adopting is a kind of a nightmare.

2508
01:51:17,351 --> 01:51:18,760
A lot of my friends have been going 
through it.

2509
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:23,820
You sign up for it and you're waiting 
for the baby to be born and the mother 

2510
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:25,180
might change their mind.
So the mother has,

2511
01:51:25,181 --> 01:51:30,181
I think two days to decide whether she 
wants to keep the baby or not after she 

2512
01:51:30,181 --> 01:51:33,631
gives birth.
And that's of course when her brain is 

2513
01:51:33,631 --> 01:51:35,341
fade and oxytocin after having it and a 
lot of couples go down to nine month 

2514
01:51:35,341 --> 01:51:39,451
journey and don't get a kid.
But if you do it from a different 

2515
01:51:39,451 --> 01:51:41,941
country,
it's a little different of a couple of 

2516
01:51:41,941 --> 01:51:41,941
gay friends.
The hard surrogate.

2517
01:51:41,941 --> 01:51:46,470
What is it,
a surrogate surrogate even for gay 

2518
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:46,470
people?
Yeah,

2519
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:46,470
I guess they use their own come.

2520
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:51,380
I don't know.
I think just a cooler shot it into a 

2521
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:51,790
Turkey based.
It had to have been one or the other.

2522
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:56,791
I don't think they knew.
Anyway,

2523
01:51:56,921 --> 01:52:00,040
they paid this woman for the last 150 
grand.

2524
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:05,300
They paid her for a year and then when 
the baby was born she decided to keep 

2525
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:05,300
it.
No,

2526
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:05,770
that's the.
That's the lawyers fault.

2527
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:08,530
There must've been something.
She's decided to keep it.

2528
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,330
I don't think you could force a woman 
to.

2529
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:15,390
You might be able to force her to give 
the money back or some of the money 

2530
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:15,390
back.
Well,

2531
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:16,570
you could sue for the money back,
but I don't know the.

2532
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,730
You could take the baby away.
That's insane.

2533
01:52:18,731 --> 01:52:20,230
In California,
the mother has.

2534
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:25,260
I think all the rights,
I think once the baby comes out of her 

2535
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:25,690
body,
she's probably like,

2536
01:52:25,691 --> 01:52:27,160
well listen,
that's my fucking baby.

2537
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,830
How do you want to make this work?
Yeah,

2538
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:32,800
I mean it's really a total chemical 
bonding thing.

2539
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:37,950
We'll also.
The might've been like some severe 

2540
01:52:37,950 --> 01:52:40,261
desperation in her life that made her 
take this position as being a surrogate 

2541
01:52:40,261 --> 01:52:42,670
mother in the first place and the money 
gave her.

2542
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:46,040
Might have alleviated St Louis problems 
that were causing

2543
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,620
her to be so desperate that she wanted 
to have a surrogate baby.

2544
01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:51,290
That's very interesting problems.
Dark for them.

2545
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:53,510
It was like really breaking.
It was heartbreaking,

2546
01:52:53,511 --> 01:52:54,980
but it was also like,
wow,

2547
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:57,260
well it's all so fucking baby.
I mean,

2548
01:52:57,261 --> 01:52:58,680
she grew in her body like

2549
01:52:59,020 --> 01:52:59,980
logically.
So have,

2550
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:02,460
you know,
friends with surrogates and and you.

2551
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:07,530
It's very stressful because you want to 
micromanage what they're eating if 

2552
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:11,281
they're sleeping.
But something that was helpful that I 

2553
01:53:11,281 --> 01:53:12,670
learned was that if a baby's not getting
the nutrients it needs it,

2554
01:53:12,671 --> 01:53:17,671
we'll take it from his mother's bones.
So if you're a surrogate is eating 

2555
01:53:17,671 --> 01:53:17,880
McDonald's,
your kids

2556
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:20,870
be fine.
You're the carrier.

2557
01:53:20,871 --> 01:53:25,871
Is the one that's going to suffer a 
little parasites just sucking and 

2558
01:53:25,871 --> 01:53:25,910
fucking suck calcium out of your

2559
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,200
babies?
Totally.

2560
01:53:27,201 --> 01:53:29,630
They suck up brain cells from the mother
to.

2561
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,360
I mean,
they're fucking vampires.

2562
01:53:31,650 --> 01:53:32,320
So dominant.

2563
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:36,310
Ten percent of their.
No,

2564
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,360
they're just tired all the time,
I think is what it is.

2565
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:41,420
They're duplicating.
I mean it's like,

2566
01:53:41,421 --> 01:53:43,960
it's a metamorphosis.
It's like a fucking piss.

2567
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:45,200
A lot of work,
but a nightmare.

2568
01:53:45,201 --> 01:53:47,960
Yeah.
It's just crazy that that's the energy.

2569
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:53,740
It's the ultimate buyer of traffic.
The thing that we look forward to the 

2570
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:54,950
most,
the thing that sells cars and fucking TV

2571
01:53:54,951 --> 01:53:58,110
shows,
long legs and sax and hate.

2572
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:03,400
And what is it really?
It's about coming in someone and making 

2573
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:03,400
a person in their body.
I mean,

2574
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:07,250
it's really like this ultimate 
biological trick of replication.

2575
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:08,640
Do you,
uh,

2576
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,240
have you ever heard of this book called.
It's a stupid name,

2577
01:54:11,241 --> 01:54:14,450
but cubits poisoned arrow.
It's about what orgasms do to your brain

2578
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:20,020
and the whole sort of theory is to not 
have an orgasm unless you're going to 

2579
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,140
actually procreate because of the 
chemicals that are released.

2580
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:22,160
It's,
it's,

2581
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:24,800
I don't know who wrote that book.
What kind of monster?

2582
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,110
Yeah.
Sex addicts that.

2583
01:54:27,111 --> 01:54:32,111
No,
that's the best way to clear your mind 

2584
01:54:32,111 --> 01:54:32,111
is to shoot a load.
I know,

2585
01:54:32,111 --> 01:54:34,760
but it's something about your golf and 
your thought process is so much clear.

2586
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:38,690
Like there's so many times that I've 
told my friends like,

2587
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:40,020
you know what?
I wanted to do mood.

2588
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:42,050
She's pressuring me.
Jerk off first.

2589
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:44,800
Then think about it.
Just go jerk off man.

2590
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:49,930
Tell me after you jerked off,
if you want to deal with all this 

2591
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:49,930
emotional bullshit that's being thrown 
at you.

2592
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:51,130
Um,
hold on.

2593
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:52,870
Will you,
I'll send this to you.

2594
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,090
I remember reading it and while I was 
reading I was like,

2595
01:54:55,091 --> 01:54:56,260
yeah,
this makes a lot of sense.

2596
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,670
I mean,
I don't want to live like that,

2597
01:54:57,671 --> 01:54:59,110
but it makes a lot of sense.
Well,

2598
01:54:59,111 --> 01:55:02,140
it's something about how if you want to 
stay in love with someone long term,

2599
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:07,320
because if you have too many orgasms,
if you produce dopamine and then after,

2600
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:10,060
because essentially we're designed to 
procreate like you said,

2601
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:12,580
and then the female starts producing 
oxytocin,

2602
01:55:12,581 --> 01:55:15,550
but the mail starts being less 
interested in the brain is like,

2603
01:55:15,551 --> 01:55:20,551
okay,
now you have to go procreate with 

2604
01:55:20,551 --> 01:55:21,661
someone else because our brain doesn't 
know that are 6 billion people on the 

2605
01:55:21,661 --> 01:55:23,020
planet and that we don't need to fucking
broke rate with a lot of different moms.

2606
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:28,400
Uh,
so it's something about if you want to 

2607
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,280
be in a relationship for a long time.
So it's like a tantric type thing.

2608
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:31,720
It kind of,
you know what,

2609
01:55:31,721 --> 01:55:33,760
I'll send it to you.
It's like it's basically about.

2610
01:55:33,761 --> 01:55:35,500
I stopped reading after like four pages,
so I was like,

2611
01:55:35,501 --> 01:55:39,850
I'm never going to fucking is.
It's about keeping Oxytocin,

2612
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,580
the bonding chemical alive with couples.
Oh,

2613
01:55:42,581 --> 01:55:44,150
that's crazy.
So they're trying

2614
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,720
to hack couples.
Yes they are.

2615
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:50,840
That's ridiculous.
How much does find someone that you 

2616
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:50,840
actually like,
that's too easy,

2617
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:52,820
but it's Kinda in La.
Is that possible?

2618
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,480
Of course.
Can Be done everywhere.

2619
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:57,370
Who would you be doing?
Who Do I think you should do?

2620
01:55:57,570 --> 01:55:58,920
I don't know.
We'll find somebody.

2621
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:00,030
We need to find you.
Somebody.

2622
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:03,240
I'm dating somebody,
but it's not working out obviously.

2623
01:56:03,241 --> 01:56:08,220
I'm just curious.
Who Do you think I should date?

2624
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,730
Curious.
Like I've cure.

2625
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:13,440
I'm just curious.
I'm curious.

2626
01:56:13,441 --> 01:56:15,780
You're a.
You always have interesting balance.

2627
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:17,920
I think the person I'm dating

2628
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:23,050
that idea but I'm sure a lot so I think 
and I mean that in the best way,

2629
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:29,340
but you're very smart and you're very 
ambitious and you're.

2630
01:56:29,341 --> 01:56:34,341
You're interested in a lot of different 
things and you have to have someone who 

2631
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,780
is similar in some ways,
nightmare.

2632
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:42,940
You know,
that know someone that I honestly 

2633
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:44,710
believe that in order for someone like 
you because I think you're an outlier in

2634
01:56:44,711 --> 01:56:47,830
a lot of ways in that you're a liar,
liar.

2635
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:53,020
That outlying aspect of your personality
because you're.

2636
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:56,770
I think you have to.
Someone has to be an outlier in some way

2637
01:56:56,771 --> 01:56:59,920
of their own in order for them to 
appreciate you because otherwise they're

2638
01:56:59,921 --> 01:57:02,500
just gonna think like,
I can't keep up with this crazy bitch.

2639
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,960
This is too much,
you know,

2640
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:04,870
she,
she doesn't sleep,

2641
01:57:04,871 --> 01:57:09,871
she gets up in the middle of night,
starts writing books and learn how to 

2642
01:57:09,871 --> 01:57:09,871
walk again.
It's like,

2643
01:57:09,871 --> 01:57:09,871
you know what I mean?

2644
01:57:09,871 --> 01:57:10,430
Yeah.
I'm like the guy,

2645
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:13,070
the grandpa from Charlotte and of bed.

2646
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:16,700
Well there's a lot of benefits to your 
type of behavior.

2647
01:57:16,701 --> 01:57:18,080
Obviously.
That's why you're so successful.

2648
01:57:18,081 --> 01:57:19,760
It's a lot of benefits to what you 
think,

2649
01:57:20,150 --> 01:57:24,950
but the negative side aspect of it 
though,

2650
01:57:24,951 --> 01:57:29,951
the where I would say it's going to be 
problematic is someone has to like for 

2651
01:57:29,951 --> 01:57:34,721
companionship.
Someone has to be able to keep up with 

2652
01:57:34,721 --> 01:57:37,481
you or understand you or accept you and 
what the way you think and the way you 

2653
01:57:38,571 --> 01:57:43,571
approach life is extremely different.
It's not the way most people do it and 

2654
01:57:46,371 --> 01:57:50,990
not the way most women do it for sure.
And if men are used to this certain type

2655
01:57:50,991 --> 01:57:55,400
of patterns that some women follow and 
then you have this pattern,

2656
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:56,570
you know,
they're going to be like,

2657
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:57,020
oh,
it's just,

2658
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:58,680
I don't want.
I just want to grow.

2659
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:01,370
Complains about starbucks,
you know,

2660
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:10,200
coconut milk,
camel milk,

2661
01:58:10,201 --> 01:58:11,700
what do we do it and goat's milk.

2662
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,040
I think,
you know,

2663
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:16,970
when I hate saying stupid shit that 
people repeat,

2664
01:58:16,971 --> 01:58:21,971
but I think this,
this repeated thing is when you're 

2665
01:58:21,971 --> 01:58:22,020
ready,
you'll find something.

2666
01:58:22,021 --> 01:58:22,570
Yeah,
that's.

2667
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,270
Yeah,
you're right.

2668
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:25,480
Because I.
and I think there's like.

2669
01:58:26,630 --> 01:58:31,630
I think a relationship really doesn't 
work unless you yourself are ready for a

2670
01:58:34,701 --> 01:58:36,790
relationship too.
That's a really good point.

2671
01:58:36,830 --> 01:58:41,830
You have to be someone that someone 
would want to be in a relationship with 

2672
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:41,830
it all the time.
I'm like,

2673
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:41,980
how about stop focusing on the other

2674
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:45,130
person?
What I want to date me once I get into a

2675
01:58:45,131 --> 01:58:47,170
place where I would want to date me or 
marry me.

2676
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:47,410
Yeah.

2677
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:49,920
And people think they're going to find 
someone,

2678
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:55,460
a person is going to calm them down and 
then they're going to be someone that's 

2679
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:55,460
worth dating.
Yeah.

2680
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:55,980
That's often calm yourself down,
right?

2681
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,150
Solve your own problems and then.
Yeah.

2682
01:58:58,220 --> 01:58:59,240
Yeah.
Hold on.

2683
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:04,280
I've been fucking song and dance for the
first couple weeks of the relationship 

2684
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:08,220
until like a buddy of mine had this girl
that he was dating for a while and then 

2685
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:12,070
his car broke down and he needed her to 
help him.

2686
01:59:12,071 --> 01:59:14,760
Like he,
his tire blew out and uh,

2687
01:59:14,761 --> 01:59:19,761
I forgot the whole story,
but she helped him in some sort of a 

2688
01:59:19,761 --> 01:59:22,621
way.
Like she came and got him or something 

2689
01:59:22,621 --> 01:59:24,061
like that.
And then she stayed over the house and 

2690
01:59:24,061 --> 01:59:26,641
then the next day she texted him like 
five fucking times in a row and he 

2691
01:59:26,641 --> 01:59:30,151
didn't text her back and then she left.
That's crazy message about now she's 

2692
01:59:30,151 --> 01:59:31,720
going to need therapy and she has trust 
issues.

2693
01:59:31,721 --> 01:59:36,721
And so it was like,
just what the fuck he was working all 

2694
01:59:36,721 --> 01:59:36,721
day.
He's like,

2695
01:59:36,721 --> 01:59:40,411
I'm just working all day.
I had one day where I tried to put my 

2696
01:59:40,411 --> 01:59:43,651
phone aside and concentrate on my work 
and you're just blowing up my fucking 

2697
01:59:43,651 --> 01:59:44,770
phone and I didn't text you back.
Now you need therapy.

2698
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:49,920
Like there's certain people that you 
enter into any sort of an intimate 

2699
01:59:50,021 --> 01:59:53,670
relationship with them and you're taking
on the burden of all this,

2700
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:58,340
which is exactly why I all this self 
shed.

2701
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:01,630
Maybe it comes up super masturbatory and
like narcissistic,

2702
02:00:01,631 --> 02:00:03,700
but I was like,
I'm done being crazy.

2703
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:08,830
It's not crazy by saying I'm done being 
crazy.

2704
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:12,160
That's crazy.
But here's the thing,

2705
02:00:12,161 --> 02:00:13,750
I don't it.
It's cute in your twenties.

2706
02:00:13,751 --> 02:00:16,450
It's not cute in your thirties to text a
guy five times in a row.

2707
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:19,420
I don't want lack of awareness.
I do not.

2708
02:00:19,421 --> 02:00:20,830
Exactly.
So I want to be able to go,

2709
02:00:20,831 --> 02:00:21,730
oh,
this is my shit.

2710
02:00:21,731 --> 02:00:26,731
This has nothing to do with him.
Like I have abandoned terror and data 

2711
02:00:26,731 --> 02:00:26,731
and like solve my accounts.
Terror,

2712
02:00:26,731 --> 02:00:27,790
terror.
It's called abandonment.

2713
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:30,370
That expression before infant maternal 
disruption.

2714
02:00:30,371 --> 02:00:34,700
So I have a band Materra,
which means I didn't hit the brakes,

2715
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,870
were always in here and it doesn't.
As soon as we start winding down,

2716
02:00:37,871 --> 02:00:40,660
I'd throw out some shit like that.
Like sperm allergy,

2717
02:00:40,690 --> 02:00:42,090
environmental disruption.

2718
02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:45,940
What's going on with your foot?
Nice talking.

2719
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:50,970
I can't get my fucking tesla.
Get outta here.

2720
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:54,390
No.
Uh,

2721
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,320
when you didn't get enough eye contact 
as a kid,

2722
02:00:56,321 --> 02:00:58,360
basically you have infant maternal 
disruption,

2723
02:00:58,361 --> 02:01:00,490
like you weren't able to get the 
connection.

2724
02:01:00,491 --> 02:01:01,410
So when,
um,

2725
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,240
when you don't get a text back or 
whatever,

2726
02:01:04,241 --> 02:01:06,880
it starts triggering really old 
abandonment terror.

2727
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:07,750
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2728
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:12,770
So that girl is broken like something 
happened from the ages of one to three 

2729
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:15,190
that now is manifesting in five text 
messages,

2730
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:20,400
you know,
but you have to get control of your own 

2731
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:20,400
shit.
You got to clean up your own yard.

2732
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:20,830
You got to fix it.
That's why I'm in 12 step programs.

2733
02:01:20,831 --> 02:01:22,510
I'm in,
I do Emdr,

2734
02:01:22,511 --> 02:01:27,511
I'm in a fuck.
I'm on all sorts of shit because I'm 

2735
02:01:27,511 --> 02:01:27,511
just like,
I'm not gonna just be a puppet of this.

2736
02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:32,610
What happened to me when I was three for
the rest of my life and I'm not gonna 

2737
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:32,610
punish the guys.
I date for it.

2738
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:34,930
It's not your fault,
but even talking about as punishment.

2739
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:36,220
Well,
I don't.

2740
02:01:36,221 --> 02:01:39,800
So in pro and I know that we're not even
dating and me talking about,

2741
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:40,070
it's like

2742
02:01:40,750 --> 02:01:44,630
instrument to me so fast with me.
So in program we don't go to the problem

2743
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:49,631
for the solution,
so it's like if the problem is you're 

2744
02:01:49,631 --> 02:01:49,631
not texting me back,
I'm not going to go to you and say,

2745
02:01:49,631 --> 02:01:50,030
Hey,
text me back,

2746
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:55,430
I'm going to go figure out the solution 
and then take the solution to the 

2747
02:01:55,430 --> 02:01:55,730
problem,
to the relationship.

2748
02:01:56,040 --> 02:02:01,040
Well I'm a big believer in the path of 
least resistance when it comes to 

2749
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:04,511
relationships.
And if someone doesn't want to text you 

2750
02:02:04,511 --> 02:02:06,671
back,
you probably shouldn't be hanging out 

2751
02:02:06,671 --> 02:02:06,671
with them.
It's pretty simple.

2752
02:02:06,671 --> 02:02:08,780
So like to like chase after people.
It's an instinct.

2753
02:02:08,810 --> 02:02:10,610
People have it like God,
why didn't they call me back?

2754
02:02:10,611 --> 02:02:12,380
But a lot of us.
How come you didn't text me back?

2755
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:16,590
You fuck a lot.
I guess we're not texting back and visit

2756
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:21,650
a Sikh people whose approval we don't 
have her whose attention we don't have 

2757
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:25,370
because we didn't get it or why I think 
text messages and even voicemail 

2758
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:29,291
messages in a,
in a way or weird in that like you send 

2759
02:02:29,291 --> 02:02:32,531
somebody something and then you wait for
them to respond and you hold and the 

2760
02:02:32,531 --> 02:02:32,531
like,
all right,

2761
02:02:32,531 --> 02:02:32,650
come on out there.

2762
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:36,920
What do we got here?
It's like send a raven to fucking scroll

2763
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:39,480
attention because it's like if I text,
you know,

2764
02:02:39,490 --> 02:02:41,600
text me back and then I see that you 
posted an instagram.

2765
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:46,850
There's this whole fucking thing.
Which did happen the other day.

2766
02:02:46,851 --> 02:02:49,790
Joe,
now Joe Jogi definitely.

2767
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:53,870
But there's this new thing of how I can 
see all the other things you're doing on

2768
02:02:53,871 --> 02:02:57,740
your phone instantly.
So I'm now all of a sudden like,

2769
02:02:57,741 --> 02:03:01,280
well you fucking responded to three's 
these tweets,

2770
02:03:01,870 --> 02:03:04,130
you know,
stock from fucking Ronda,

2771
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:07,430
but you didn't text me back.
It turns into that shotgun,

2772
02:03:07,431 --> 02:03:11,850
Rhonda.
So I'm not going to start with her.

2773
02:03:12,370 --> 02:03:14,390
Love her very much.
Which one you're talking about?

2774
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,390
Oh,
oh,

2775
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:16,810
have the doctor.
Rhonda.

2776
02:03:17,110 --> 02:03:22,110
Rhonda Rousey Rousey,
I thought you were just making people's 

2777
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:22,110
names.
Oh No,

2778
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:26,080
no.
I just was trying to think of someone 

2779
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:26,080
who you might tweet with it or tweet 
about or something.

2780
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:27,410
Um,
but uh,

2781
02:03:27,470 --> 02:03:32,470
but yeah,
so now I think with all of these other 

2782
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:32,470
things,
it makes things,

2783
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:36,100
it makes it harder to just solely focus 
on the purity of did he text me back or 

2784
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:36,100
not?
It's like he didn't text me back,

2785
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:37,520
but he did all these other things on his
phone.

2786
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:40,580
It was just human beings enter into 
relationships.

2787
02:03:40,581 --> 02:03:43,370
Even friendships like.
And when I say relationship,

2788
02:03:43,371 --> 02:03:48,371
I don't mean sexual,
just like any time that you're relating 

2789
02:03:48,371 --> 02:03:51,161
to other people,
it's the person that you're hanging 

2790
02:03:51,161 --> 02:03:53,370
around with.
They change how you are like you,

2791
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:58,400
you are who you are.
You have like this base and then you 

2792
02:03:58,400 --> 02:03:59,240
might be lighter around certain people 
or friend.

2793
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:04,400
Totally.
There's like a chemical reaction that 

2794
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:04,910
you have to people's personalities.
Instantly.

2795
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:07,070
When I see a comic I stopped trying to 
be funny.

2796
02:04:07,630 --> 02:04:09,870
It's the best thing.
Like I,

2797
02:04:09,930 --> 02:04:12,740
I'm not like don't ever make jokes,
but as soon as I'm going to comment,

2798
02:04:12,741 --> 02:04:13,390
I'm like,
ah,

2799
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:15,080
I don't have to try to make you laugh.
Oh,

2800
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:20,081
okay.
So you feel like when you're around 

2801
02:04:20,081 --> 02:04:21,731
people that aren't comics,
like you're almost obligated because I 

2802
02:04:21,731 --> 02:04:21,731
know you're funny.
Yeah.

2803
02:04:21,731 --> 02:04:22,520
It's like your thing about,
it's just different reactions.

2804
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:27,521
Certain people trigger different things 
and it's like that may be your own 

2805
02:04:27,521 --> 02:04:28,700
expectations of what you think people 
want to be.

2806
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:33,840
Could be or it's like the performance or
the show or the costume I put on to 

2807
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,720
avoid intimacy or to having to really 
connect to somebody.

2808
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:38,070
Do you think that like with every day in

2809
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:43,070
every hour and every time you obsessed 
and all these things and all these 

2810
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:46,041
different paths that you go down,
like every day gets a little better 

2811
02:04:46,041 --> 02:04:46,041
every day,
get a little better at it,

2812
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:47,280
get a little better at life.

2813
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:48,680
Yes,
yes.

2814
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:50,300
And if I haven't,
I'm like,

2815
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:55,360
you know,
but it depends on also what comes up 

2816
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:55,360
because it's like,
you know,

2817
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:58,890
sometimes you're like fucking nailing it
and then a trigger comes along and 

2818
02:04:58,890 --> 02:05:01,711
you're like,
I didn't even know that was a trigger 

2819
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:01,711
that was weird,
you know,

2820
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:03,900
or like a totally new stimulus.
Dynamic comes along.

2821
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:07,190
The instagram is invented.
Like I'm nailing it with guys they can,

2822
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:08,720
they don't have to text me back.
I feel great.

2823
02:05:08,721 --> 02:05:12,590
And then they put up my shit now 
instagram was fucking invented and now I

2824
02:05:12,591 --> 02:05:14,540
have to see what they're doing and that 
I have to compare,

2825
02:05:14,541 --> 02:05:15,480
you know?
So it's like,

2826
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:19,550
it's,
our environments are changing so fast.

2827
02:05:19,551 --> 02:05:24,551
It's hard for our sort of emotional and 
mental progress to keep up with all 

2828
02:05:24,551 --> 02:05:29,051
these new sort of curve balls unless you
turn your phone block and should off 

2829
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,150
just all like have you ever.

2830
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:34,580
Oh yeah.
If I have to put so like a chastity belt

2831
02:05:34,581 --> 02:05:36,200
on my phone,
I like,

2832
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:36,630
it's,
I,

2833
02:05:36,650 --> 02:05:41,650
I have to protect and when I drive I 
have to put in the backseat because I 

2834
02:05:41,650 --> 02:05:44,441
will text and drive in the back seat.
I put it in the back seat because I 

2835
02:05:44,441 --> 02:05:44,900
don't trust myself because I literally 
will just look,

2836
02:05:44,901 --> 02:05:47,290
I'll just be driving and I'll look down 
and all of a sudden I'm on my phone.

2837
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:48,050
I'm like,
what the fuck?

2838
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:51,530
This is so dangerous.
It's so you go unconscious.

2839
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,080
Yeah.
And I rear ended somebody like.

2840
02:05:54,081 --> 02:05:59,081
And it wasn't like email.
I literally just looked down at my 

2841
02:05:59,081 --> 02:05:59,081
phone.
I was like pulling up to a stop sign and

2842
02:05:59,081 --> 02:06:01,820
I thought I was stopped and uh,
you know,

2843
02:06:01,821 --> 02:06:04,270
they say that uh,
uh,

2844
02:06:04,460 --> 02:06:07,490
texting is now worse than drunk driving.
More people die from texting and driving

2845
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:10,340
and driving and I don't even think it's,
I just,

2846
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,260
yeah,
I just think it's not going to happen to

2847
02:06:12,261 --> 02:06:14,510
me.
I don't know what magical fucking addict

2848
02:06:14,511 --> 02:06:16,610
thinking I'm doing,
but I literally will just like look down

2849
02:06:16,611 --> 02:06:18,140
at my phone and I ran into this guy and 
I was like,

2850
02:06:18,650 --> 02:06:20,930
I'm so sorry.
Totally my fault.

2851
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:22,550
And I was like,
that's going to be my rock bottom.

2852
02:06:22,730 --> 02:06:27,730
It wasn't bad at all.
It was like a little ding and I was 

2853
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:27,730
okay.
That needed to happen.

2854
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:27,730
I need,

2855
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:31,190
don't you think that your ideas of what 
is going to happen or based on what's 

2856
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:32,070
already happened and nothing's happened 
yet,

2857
02:06:32,071 --> 02:06:32,790
so you assume,
well,

2858
02:06:32,791 --> 02:06:33,990
I'm in the car,
I'm driving.

2859
02:06:33,991 --> 02:06:36,290
Nothing happens when I'm driving,
I'm finding the valley.

2860
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:36,990
What's the,

2861
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:39,470
what am I going to die in a car 
accident.

2862
02:06:39,471 --> 02:06:41,840
I mean it's like,
that's not the story I wrote for myself,

2863
02:06:41,841 --> 02:06:44,630
but no one gives a fuck about that.
No one has that script,

2864
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:45,710
right?
Everyone's isn't.

2865
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:47,930
Everyone isn't running around,
you know,

2866
02:06:48,170 --> 02:06:49,490
trying to make sure I stay alive

2867
02:06:49,570 --> 02:06:54,570
and that brings it all back to like you 
go into Vietnam and you experiencing of 

2868
02:06:54,570 --> 02:06:58,480
another possibility that like you or I 
were both really lucky they were born in

2869
02:06:58,481 --> 02:07:00,820
America,
were born white,

2870
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:04,800
wealthy people in America too.
I mean not born it but you know,

2871
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:08,470
I wasn't either but we're lucky.
We're lucky as fuck.

2872
02:07:08,471 --> 02:07:10,780
Like this situation with this situation 
wasn't possible.

2873
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:11,670
Literally live in Vr.

2874
02:07:11,740 --> 02:07:16,110
I feel like what I realized is like know
because when everyone's like,

2875
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,580
I'm tired.
Like everyone's like this.

2876
02:07:18,581 --> 02:07:22,120
Just like people love being sick to love
it.

2877
02:07:22,180 --> 02:07:23,800
They fucking love it.
I don't feel good.

2878
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:25,300
I have a headache.
I have this.

2879
02:07:25,301 --> 02:07:30,301
I have a thyroid thing.
When you think about having sicknesses 

2880
02:07:30,301 --> 02:07:31,810
are just distractions though,
right?

2881
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:35,020
Lyme disease or whatever.
The fight if you really.

2882
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:36,130
Lyme disease.
I'm so sorry.

2883
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:37,480
Tim Ferriss.
So sorry.

2884
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:39,490
But I mean,
is lyme disease?

2885
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:40,800
He had it.
Yeah,

2886
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:42,340
it was like,
I think really bad.

2887
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:43,690
Um,
but like,

2888
02:07:43,691 --> 02:07:45,040
I mean everyone's like,
I'm tired.

2889
02:07:45,041 --> 02:07:46,150
I think I have lyme disease.
I'm like no,

2890
02:07:46,151 --> 02:07:48,460
people really have lyme disease or 
people are like,

2891
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:49,600
I'm allergic to gluten.
I'm like,

2892
02:07:49,601 --> 02:07:50,940
do you have celiac disease?
Are you,

2893
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:52,930
do you just need to be sick because it 
gets you attention,

2894
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:57,931
like you know,
and then you go to a place where people 

2895
02:07:57,931 --> 02:08:00,601
are actually saying and actually have 
problems and it just,

2896
02:08:00,820 --> 02:08:05,820
it just really changes your perspective.
Did you ever see that Louis C K bit 

2897
02:08:06,251 --> 02:08:08,430
about being white?
Probably,

2898
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:10,320
but it makes me think of the one cause 
I,

2899
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:12,970
cause I was thinking this isn't a bit I 
do obviously,

2900
02:08:12,971 --> 02:08:14,680
but I just remember after being in 
Vietnam,

2901
02:08:14,681 --> 02:08:16,210
I was like,
we should just walk around all the time.

2902
02:08:16,211 --> 02:08:17,140
It'd be like,
that's awesome.

2903
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:18,040
This is so cool.

2904
02:08:20,150 --> 02:08:22,750
Like we should.
It should just constantly be like,

2905
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:24,790
oh my God,
this is water in this bottle.

2906
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:30,160
He has this amazing bit where he's like,
you could go back to any time in history

2907
02:08:30,221 --> 02:08:32,580
and it would be amazing.
He's like,

2908
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:35,470
that's the thing about being white and 
it's like being white is great.

2909
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:37,450
He goes,
you can go back 200 years ago.

2910
02:08:37,451 --> 02:08:40,270
You don't have to worry about being a 
slave is like

2911
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:45,540
just white people.
Irish people didn't have it so good for 

2912
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:48,181
awhile.
While there's definitely some mean it's 

2913
02:08:48,181 --> 02:08:48,210
a joke,
but take that low.

2914
02:08:48,270 --> 02:08:52,130
What about the Irish found little 
debunking your bit,

2915
02:08:52,910 --> 02:08:57,910
but he also.
That thing about everything is amazing 

2916
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:57,910
and all we do is complain about the,
about the flying and people.

2917
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:58,880
Like my flight was $45.

2918
02:08:59,110 --> 02:09:03,070
I went on this hunting trip in Prince of
Wales Island,

2919
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:06,250
which is in Alaska and it's unbelievably
rainy.

2920
02:09:06,251 --> 02:09:11,251
I mean we were just drenched for six 
days and I just thought in my head for 

2921
02:09:11,251 --> 02:09:13,330
some reason that you'd be dry when you 
get in the tent.

2922
02:09:13,570 --> 02:09:14,170
I'd be like,
well,

2923
02:09:14,171 --> 02:09:15,460
once you get the tech,
it'd be dry,

2924
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:19,120
but you never really get dry because the
air is wet and there's mist everywhere,

2925
02:09:19,150 --> 02:09:21,400
so everything's wet.
You're sleeping bags soaking wet.

2926
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:24,070
The only thing that saves you and keeps 
you warm is the fact that you're wearing

2927
02:09:24,071 --> 02:09:29,071
wool.
Wool retains body heat even when it's 

2928
02:09:29,071 --> 02:09:33,091
wet.
Unlike cotton and a lot of synthetic 

2929
02:09:33,091 --> 02:09:33,091
fabrics don't do it.
Oh,

2930
02:09:33,091 --> 02:09:34,630
interesting.
But wool is amazing.

2931
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:35,900
It's an animal,
right?

2932
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:36,490
Yeah,
an animals.

2933
02:09:36,491 --> 02:09:38,800
Exactly.
So like when you have wool socks on,

2934
02:09:38,801 --> 02:09:40,390
even if your feet are wet,
you're still warm.

2935
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:45,430
Wool is.
The Shit is just so important for people

2936
02:09:45,431 --> 02:09:48,110
that are in the outdoors,
like wool undergarment probably.

2937
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:50,980
I think wolves get them more than the 
cold,

2938
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:54,000
but I mean.
Oh,

2939
02:09:54,001 --> 02:09:54,650
good point.
Okay,

2940
02:09:54,651 --> 02:09:55,130
got it.
Sorry.

2941
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:56,480
I was like,
I thought you meant wolf hair.

2942
02:09:56,481 --> 02:09:57,490
I was like,
wolves have.

2943
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:58,610
Whoa,
whoa.

2944
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:00,290
That's their.
Their hair is a wall.

2945
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:00,710
Sorry.

2946
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:02,370
Point was that,
um,

2947
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:06,060
so six days in this soaked environment,
just every day,

2948
02:10:06,061 --> 02:10:08,880
just being just completely wet,
everything's wet.

2949
02:10:08,910 --> 02:10:10,560
Everything you do is what your face is 
like.

2950
02:10:10,561 --> 02:10:15,561
A sheen that you could feel it on you,
it's like you're just wet and cold and 

2951
02:10:15,561 --> 02:10:18,600
that came back and it was sunny and it 
was 80 and I was like,

2952
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:23,660
this is amazing.
And I was driving around in La and I'm 

2953
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:23,660
like,
I love it here.

2954
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:25,110
It's so.
And I called my friend Steve.

2955
02:10:25,111 --> 02:10:26,410
Same Guy,
Steven Alan.

2956
02:10:26,430 --> 02:10:27,750
I called him up and I go,
dude,

2957
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,750
I am so fucking happy.
I've never been this happy,

2958
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:32,910
but it's because I was miserable for 
those.

2959
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:34,310
It's so important

2960
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:35,440
to have it.
Every shade it.

2961
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:37,040
Yes,
I was in,

2962
02:10:37,250 --> 02:10:38,690
in Vietnam,
like I said,

2963
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:41,870
they wear masks.
I went for a run with this motherfucker.

2964
02:10:41,871 --> 02:10:45,320
Who back to your point about flat feet.
He's like the marathon guy who was like,

2965
02:10:45,321 --> 02:10:46,900
you're supposed to run barefooted.
Right?

2966
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:52,020
So he's barefoot run guy and this was 
the first non barefoot Ron who's done 

2967
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:52,500
because it was in Vietnam and there's 
just like,

2968
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:56,480
you shouldn't last nightmare and just 
dead animals.

2969
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:00,110
It was dysentery.
Just babies by the way.

2970
02:11:00,111 --> 02:11:02,000
Also just kids everywhere.
I'm like,

2971
02:11:02,001 --> 02:11:03,140
do you have a parent?
Like,

2972
02:11:03,141 --> 02:11:08,141
I mean,
there's just like three year old 

2973
02:11:08,141 --> 02:11:09,340
toddlers just running businesses can 
literally like,

2974
02:11:09,710 --> 02:11:10,870
excuse me,
like,

2975
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:12,890
do you work here like you literally will
do,

2976
02:11:12,891 --> 02:11:17,891
so I'll send you some of the photos.
You'll see a kid just at a store alone 

2977
02:11:17,891 --> 02:11:17,891
and you're like,
what is avenue?

2978
02:11:17,891 --> 02:11:20,990
So fucking dangerous and uh,
and everyone's in mass,

2979
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:26,760
they can't breathe the oxygen there.
And we went for a run and I came back 

2980
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:29,260
and I felt like I had smoked four packs 
of cigarettes and I came back to La.

2981
02:11:29,261 --> 02:11:33,670
And even just doing that was like a 
little mini miracle.

2982
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:38,880
Did you ever see that?
There's a story that was written about 

2983
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,971
Mark Zuckerberg who was in China and he 
went for a run during like one of the 

2984
02:11:41,971 --> 02:11:42,910
worst days,
one of the worst pollution days.

2985
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:45,750
And he's out there jogging around and 
you know,

2986
02:11:45,810 --> 02:11:47,380
you look at the air behind them,
it's like,

2987
02:11:47,381 --> 02:11:49,810
Ugh,
you're jogging into like an exhausting

2988
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:51,730
pipe.
Could he did,

2989
02:11:51,731 --> 02:11:53,180
he just doesn't see.
I mean it's,

2990
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:53,830
it's hard.

2991
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:56,870
Can you wanted to experience it because,
you know,

2992
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:57,960
just to know.
I mean,

2993
02:11:57,961 --> 02:11:59,910
he's an interesting guy.
I mean,

2994
02:11:59,970 --> 02:12:04,020
he's obviously very thoughtful guy and I
think that maybe he wanted to experience

2995
02:12:04,021 --> 02:12:04,680
it was just because

2996
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:07,330
just to know those people,
I can pay for it.

2997
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:10,030
Whatever happens to me so we can get new
lungs,

2998
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:14,450
I'll just get some fucking stem cells to
regenerate Brianna Mahon,

2999
02:12:14,451 --> 02:12:16,270
my lungs.
But uh,

3000
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:17,000
but yeah,
I mean,

3001
02:12:17,001 --> 02:12:18,020
and that's the,
I think.

3002
02:12:18,021 --> 02:12:20,060
And I also like,
once you see that kind of pollution,

3003
02:12:20,061 --> 02:12:21,200
it's like,
you know,

3004
02:12:21,201 --> 02:12:22,730
because it's,
there's so many charities and there's so

3005
02:12:22,731 --> 02:12:27,731
many fucking problems.
You can't try to solve all of them or 

3006
02:12:27,731 --> 02:12:27,731
be,
you know,

3007
02:12:27,731 --> 02:12:27,950
such a small part.
But I was like,

3008
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:29,690
oh,
this is the first time that I was like,

3009
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:32,870
I needed like only Dubai,
you know,

3010
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,480
there's like carbon neutral companies 
and companies that,

3011
02:12:35,481 --> 02:12:40,481
you know,
put less emissions out and stuff and 

3012
02:12:40,481 --> 02:12:40,481
you're like,
yeah,

3013
02:12:40,481 --> 02:12:40,700
I should start voting with things I buy.
And you know,

3014
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:45,701
it's the first time I got this app that 
tells you what companies don't emit as 

3015
02:12:45,701 --> 02:12:46,430
much pollution,
you know,

3016
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:47,390
stuff like that.
And I'm like,

3017
02:12:47,391 --> 02:12:52,391
I never really thought about that before
until I was breathing in like viscous 

3018
02:12:52,391 --> 02:12:52,391
toxic air.
Well,

3019
02:12:52,391 --> 02:12:54,640
it's interesting because just being a 
human being,

3020
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:59,470
just by the nature,
the nature of our existence,

3021
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:04,740
we consume constantly and we're 
constantly using things that are 

3022
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:09,241
detrimental to the environment and 
people will concentrate on certain 

3023
02:13:09,241 --> 02:13:09,241
things.
Like,

3024
02:13:09,241 --> 02:13:09,940
Hey,
I ride my bike everywhere.

3025
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:11,650
So my carbon footprint is less.
Yeah,

3026
02:13:11,651 --> 02:13:13,570
but you're still using plastic 
motherfucker.

3027
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:15,850
That shit goes into garbage.
Totally,

3028
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:19,060
totally.
Wastes refilling.

3029
02:13:19,061 --> 02:13:22,720
What are those called?
The landfills to landfills.

3030
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:27,870
They wind up getting into the ocean,
like all the stuff that we do has an 

3031
02:13:27,870 --> 02:13:28,570
effect all of it.
100 percent.

3032
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:32,070
Like this idea that you're immune 
because you ride your bike everywhere or

3033
02:13:32,071 --> 02:13:35,340
because you have an electric car.
That one drives me fucking crazy because

3034
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:36,630
by the way,
those electric cars,

3035
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:39,690
those fucking minerals,
those cards has apparently.

3036
02:13:39,691 --> 02:13:42,500
Cause they are not recyclable right now.
Well,

3037
02:13:42,501 --> 02:13:43,950
not only that,
their conflict minerals,

3038
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:46,620
a lot of the batteries,
they're getting the minerals from places

3039
02:13:46,621 --> 02:13:47,970
that are like,
they're there.

3040
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:50,580
There's a real issue with where they're 
getting this,

3041
02:13:50,610 --> 02:13:55,610
these minerals to make these batteries 
like that's one of the big things about 

3042
02:13:55,861 --> 02:14:00,861
Afghanistan,
like one of the big things about Canada 

3043
02:14:00,861 --> 02:14:00,861
and they found trillions of dollars 
worth of lithium in the,

3044
02:14:00,861 --> 02:14:05,710
in the mountains and they believe it's 
one of the reasons why we're there in 

3045
02:14:05,710 --> 02:14:05,710
the first place.
There's,

3046
02:14:05,710 --> 02:14:10,100
there's all sorts of.
There's all sorts of natural resources 

3047
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:11,760
that the Soviets wanted out of 
Afghanistan.

3048
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:16,910
The natural gas pipeline.
It's one of the main reasons why they 

3049
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:20,541
believe that some of the neo-cons we're 
very interested in protecting and 

3050
02:14:20,541 --> 02:14:23,040
invading Afghanistan is not just the 
poppy business,

3051
02:14:23,041 --> 02:14:24,870
which is huge.
Look,

3052
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:28,290
it's a giant fucking business and the 
idea that,

3053
02:14:28,291 --> 02:14:33,291
well,
we wouldn't have anything to do with 

3054
02:14:33,291 --> 02:14:33,291
that because it's not illegal or because
it's illegal.

3055
02:14:33,291 --> 02:14:36,971
Well,
that's not true because if you look at 

3056
02:14:36,971 --> 02:14:36,971
what happened in Vietnam,
Vietnam,

3057
02:14:36,971 --> 02:14:39,060
a big part of the reason why people were
in Vietnam,

3058
02:14:39,210 --> 02:14:44,210
why some people supportive being in 
Vietnam is because they were profiting 

3059
02:14:44,210 --> 02:14:44,210
off controlling the heroin trade.

3060
02:14:44,210 --> 02:14:49,130
That's a fact.
There was a fucking trillion dollars 

3061
02:14:49,130 --> 02:14:52,311
made during the Vietnam War from heroin 
sales and where it was made and why and 

3062
02:14:52,891 --> 02:14:57,891
who got the money and where the 
corruption took place and where the 

3063
02:14:57,891 --> 02:15:00,801
money was being handed out.
That's all open to speculation and 

3064
02:15:00,801 --> 02:15:03,921
research and maybe someone will 
eventually have it all figured out one 

3065
02:15:03,921 --> 02:15:06,861
day,
but the reality is there was a massive 

3066
02:15:06,861 --> 02:15:07,470
amount of fucking heroin that was being 
moved.

3067
02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:08,670
Whoa,
Jesus Christ.

3068
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:12,390
I'm getting crazy heroin.
Nothing happened.

3069
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:17,190
I got lucky dude.
So like that.

3070
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:22,320
Your coffee is made of like coconut oil 
and butter that it's like white barely 

3071
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:22,320
move your coffee.
It's like,

3072
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,000
it's like,
it's like lava.

3073
02:15:25,490 --> 02:15:30,490
It's thick plastic like my stout loads,
but my point being that these batteries 

3074
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,600
that they're making these fucking car 
batteries out of there.

3075
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:40,620
It's like Afghanistan sits on 
$1,000,000,000,000

3076
02:15:40,621 --> 02:15:43,230
in minerals.
You're telling me that they're not there

3077
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:47,400
partially for that or that someone is 
not looking at that as saying like,

3078
02:15:47,401 --> 02:15:52,401
hey,
maybe we should figure out how to suck 

3079
02:15:52,401 --> 02:15:53,030
those fucking minerals out of the ground
and make a trillion dollars.

3080
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:58,130
Like the idea that we're not.
It's crazy the idea that that's not a 

3081
02:15:58,130 --> 02:16:01,641
part of the equation is utter complete 
nonsense and I think that the amount of 

3082
02:16:02,911 --> 02:16:06,750
minerals that are in these fucking car 
batteries is something we really need to

3083
02:16:06,751 --> 02:16:11,751
look at because I was reading this whole
piece about conflict minerals and how 

3084
02:16:11,751 --> 02:16:15,180
non-green electric cars actually are.
Have you stop and look at it like.

3085
02:16:15,181 --> 02:16:17,040
Yeah.
As far as like our environment.

3086
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:18,420
Yes,
for sure.

3087
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:21,810
They definitely pollute our environment 
less,

3088
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:25,920
but if we look at the actual 
repercussions of creating these things,

3089
02:16:25,921 --> 02:16:28,410
like how are these minerals being 
sourced?

3090
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,490
How are they these batteries?
What,

3091
02:16:30,610 --> 02:16:35,610
what are the,
what's the adverse effects of creating 

3092
02:16:35,610 --> 02:16:35,610
these batteries?
It's not clean and free.

3093
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:40,240
So people run around saying,
I drive my electric car and you know,

3094
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:45,420
and uh,
I only eat organic and so I'm free of 

3095
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:45,420
any

3096
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:47,160
know you're free of bullshit.
You're free of your own,

3097
02:16:47,161 --> 02:16:48,870
your own bullshit gal because.
Yeah.

3098
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:52,040
But business being a fucking human,
being a human,

3099
02:16:52,220 --> 02:16:54,260
you're using things were consumed.
Yeah.

3100
02:16:54,261 --> 02:16:56,360
We should all consume less,
most certainly,

3101
02:16:56,690 --> 02:16:59,810
but like even people will only 
vegetables and grains,

3102
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:05,000
God damn large scale green operations 
destroy massive amounts of wildlife,

3103
02:17:05,031 --> 02:17:07,130
habitat,
displaced animals killed.

3104
02:17:07,131 --> 02:17:10,340
Those grain combines are completely 
indiscriminate.

3105
02:17:10,460 --> 02:17:15,460
They chew up rodents and fucking deer 
fawns and ground nesting birds and 

3106
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,340
forget about insects.

3107
02:17:16,380 --> 02:17:18,650
Can you get me started on the bees

3108
02:17:18,770 --> 02:17:20,360
bugs?
Just bugs alone.

3109
02:17:20,361 --> 02:17:25,361
I mean,
what do we have a hierarchy of what we 

3110
02:17:25,361 --> 02:17:27,810
will and won't allow being killed.
We have these ideas well,

3111
02:17:27,950 --> 02:17:32,950
well like animals exhibit fear and 
emotions and react to our environment so

3112
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:38,300
we shouldn't kill them.
But bees or insects like a mosquito.

3113
02:17:38,301 --> 02:17:41,210
Well that's a different thing because 
that's life but it's not

3114
02:17:41,470 --> 02:17:46,470
no fees.
It's like be the source of everything 

3115
02:17:46,470 --> 02:17:47,580
but like mosquitoes,
mosquitoes,

3116
02:17:48,030 --> 02:17:50,800
mosquitoes carry diseases and they 
checked the.

3117
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:53,790
Yeah,
they mosquitoes make sure the population

3118
02:17:53,791 --> 02:17:58,791
stays low,
but arguably like insects are probably 

3119
02:17:58,791 --> 02:18:02,170
one of the best sources of protein that 
we could ever get stalled.

3120
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:06,120
I felt like there was an insect protein 
movement happening and it just sort of.

3121
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:11,440
Well,
I think it's a perception issue because 

3122
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:11,440
I think a lot of people have the idea 
that one,

3123
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:15,670
when I was in Mexico recently,
they they serve crickets like the hotel 

3124
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:15,840
we were at.
They will.

3125
02:18:15,870 --> 02:18:18,560
They have these like they look like 
they're stir fried

3126
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:20,780
crickets and they left him in our hotel 
room.

3127
02:18:20,781 --> 02:18:22,880
It was like a snack was covered with 
Saran wrap.

3128
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:24,320
Nobody ate it,
but me,

3129
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:27,860
of course I fucking fear factor you 
guys.

3130
02:18:27,890 --> 02:18:31,540
It was literally eating,
but you've seen all that,

3131
02:18:31,541 --> 02:18:36,541
but they all ate them like regularly 
there they were eating these because 

3132
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:37,040
it's like we'll eat snails lead frog 
legs.

3133
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,200
It's like,
well there is a very weird line.

3134
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:43,160
Maybe in our line is different than like
the Yulin dog festival line.

3135
02:18:43,220 --> 02:18:46,760
Don't we can talk about that.
Fascinating.

3136
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:48,450
But yeah.
But when I was in A.

3137
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:49,520
Yeah,
in Vietnam,

3138
02:18:49,521 --> 02:18:52,250
the stuff that they was like jellyfish 
and squared,

3139
02:18:52,251 --> 02:18:55,010
it was a lot of,
I guess what's available in that region.

3140
02:18:55,011 --> 02:18:56,660
It's probably 100 percent,
but yeah,

3141
02:18:56,661 --> 02:18:58,590
there was so much more.
Uh,

3142
02:18:58,730 --> 02:19:00,480
we feel like a meeting,
a jellyfish,

3143
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:03,360
willing to them.
They're just sucking jellyfish.

3144
02:19:03,650 --> 02:19:04,000
I know

3145
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:09,750
bugs to me are really a fascinating 
thing because one of the things that we 

3146
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:11,170
found out when we were doing fear factor
is that our ge,

3147
02:19:11,171 --> 02:19:13,330
so like if you have an allergy to 
certain shellfish,

3148
02:19:13,331 --> 02:19:14,710
you also have an allergy to Roaches,

3149
02:19:14,990 --> 02:19:16,140
Huh?
Yeah.

3150
02:19:16,490 --> 02:19:17,040
So,
uh,

3151
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:22,060
we found that out the hard way lawsuit.
But bugs

3152
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:28,270
are an excellent source of protein and 
people don't have the same emotional 

3153
02:19:28,270 --> 02:19:28,270
attachment

3154
02:19:28,270 --> 02:19:32,000
to a bug,
but we have a visceral negative reaction

3155
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:33,890
like repulsion to them.
Right?

3156
02:19:33,891 --> 02:19:38,891
But if they did something but it was 
ground up in some sort of a protein 

3157
02:19:38,891 --> 02:19:40,510
peddling cricket protein is real.
You've ever cricket bar now?

3158
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:41,570
Protein bars are good.
Oh,

3159
02:19:41,571 --> 02:19:42,590
here we go.
Look at this.

3160
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:44,930
Expo crickets.
The future of protein,

3161
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:45,860
soy,
dairy,

3162
02:19:45,861 --> 02:19:48,470
grain and gluten free.
Paleo and environmentally friendly.

3163
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:51,350
Yeah.
I'll eat the shit out of some crickets.

3164
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:56,600
Do they taste like anything bad?
It just tastes like soy protein or 

3165
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:57,800
something.
It's not like you're eating lobster,

3166
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:00,080
but it's not like you're eating shit.

3167
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:08,900
Cricket bars.
It's not like you're eating lobster,

3168
02:20:08,930 --> 02:20:11,630
but I wonder.
It's not like you're eating shit because

3169
02:20:11,631 --> 02:20:16,631
there's the ultimate debate.
There's a lot of people that are like 

3170
02:20:16,631 --> 02:20:20,230
really strict vegetarians and they're 
not eating vegan because they want to 

3171
02:20:20,230 --> 02:20:21,680
leave the least amount of footprint 
possible.

3172
02:20:21,681 --> 02:20:26,681
I totally understand all those,
but I wonder how they would feel about 

3173
02:20:26,681 --> 02:20:29,320
crickets.
I wonder how they feel about perception 

3174
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:29,320
issue,
you know?

3175
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:30,860
Well it isn't.
It isn't.

3176
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:35,900
You know what I mean?
We perceived dogs to be cute and Catia 

3177
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:36,430
Labor.
So when we perceived crickets to be like

3178
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:38,860
gross and dirty,
but like,

3179
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:44,120
but it's there and they're still alive.
When would you be willing to eat a bug?

3180
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:48,330
Like if you're not willing to eat like a
deer,

3181
02:20:48,530 --> 02:20:50,640
would you be willing to eat a bug,
you know,

3182
02:20:50,670 --> 02:20:52,880
gets a live bug.
No dead bug.

3183
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:58,320
Like someone like maybe someone who's 
vegetarian and they do it for ethical 

3184
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:00,170
reasons or they have a concern about 
being about bugs.

3185
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:05,170
They don't have a lot of meat.
So I feel like I'm eating just a little 

3186
02:21:05,170 --> 02:21:05,170
skeleton.
I feel like it's eating a scale.

3187
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:10,190
I feel like I'm meeting a skeleton and 
not like a meat that I can sort of 

3188
02:21:10,190 --> 02:21:11,280
disassociate from their head.
That's fucked up skeleton.

3189
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:14,330
When you grind that shit up,
it's actually pretty high in protein.

3190
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:15,660
No,
it's both.

3191
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:16,460
I mean,
yeah,

3192
02:21:16,461 --> 02:21:20,410
but there's something.
There's something just kind of Ooh,

3193
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:22,520
ugly about it,
but I also think that we're.

3194
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:24,690
Sorry to bring this back to the way 
we're trying.

3195
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:29,880
I think that were designed to squirm and
bugs because everyone's squirms at bugs 

3196
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:33,350
because I think they carry diseases,
poison and more than diseases,

3197
02:21:33,830 --> 02:21:38,830
so we're evolved to go to bugs,
which has probably saved a lot of our 

3198
02:21:38,830 --> 02:21:42,101
lives.
You know that we're not running around 

3199
02:21:42,101 --> 02:21:42,260
eating them since there,
other than lyme disease and malaria.

3200
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:43,850
Malaria is a giant one.
Of course.

3201
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:48,880
What else does carry what other diseases
who are allergic to bees?

3202
02:21:49,341 --> 02:21:50,060
Wass.
Sure.

3203
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:52,970
Stuff like that.
There's spiders,

3204
02:21:52,971 --> 02:21:55,430
black widow,
spiders or those are poisons.

3205
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:56,420
Oh yeah,
sorry.

3206
02:21:57,170 --> 02:21:59,540
Seizes lyme disease.
A big one.

3207
02:21:59,541 --> 02:22:03,200
Malaria's the biggest malaria has killed
a fuckload of people.

3208
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:08,460
Yeah.
I have a buddy's got malaria right now 

3209
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:08,460
for the second time.
CICA and should not seek out.

3210
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:09,890
What was the one before that?
What was the one who.

3211
02:22:10,150 --> 02:22:11,530
How do you say it?
Did you say Zika?

3212
02:22:11,531 --> 02:22:13,700
Is it whatever it is.
I watched.

3213
02:22:13,930 --> 02:22:17,720
I saw it on Fox News so I wouldn't go to
Mexico because of it.

3214
02:22:17,930 --> 02:22:19,220
But they're scared.
There's.

3215
02:22:19,221 --> 02:22:20,480
What's the other one that was before 
that?

3216
02:22:20,481 --> 02:22:22,160
Not Anthrax.
It was just tap.

3217
02:22:22,220 --> 02:22:23,810
Ebola was.
That was that.

3218
02:22:23,870 --> 02:22:26,010
That's from spit isn't a

3219
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,210
monkey.
Somebody fucked a monkey.

3220
02:22:27,230 --> 02:22:28,320
Someone to talk to her.
That's right.

3221
02:22:28,580 --> 02:22:29,270
Always.
Monkeys.

3222
02:22:29,890 --> 02:22:32,130
Diseases.
The diseases that come from bugs.

3223
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:37,220
Oh boy.
There's a lot of foot and mouth or 

3224
02:22:37,341 --> 02:22:42,120
what's I'm a look at this one.
Chaga is disease and look at the vector.

3225
02:22:42,121 --> 02:22:45,390
Various assassin bugs,
fever,

3226
02:22:45,391 --> 02:22:47,940
lung,
heart or mucus membranes.

3227
02:22:47,941 --> 02:22:49,920
Symptoms.
What the fuck's in assassin?

3228
02:22:49,921 --> 02:22:54,921
Bug.
Have you ever heard of a mild symptoms 

3229
02:22:56,971 --> 02:23:00,880
and chronic heart or brain inflammation?
What the fuck?

3230
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:05,280
Mild relative of the Ninja bug.
Whoa.

3231
02:23:05,430 --> 02:23:10,430
Plague the flea is subfamily of a try.
A total fucking assholes.

3232
02:23:14,970 --> 02:23:17,250
Assholes do not give a shit.
Well,

3233
02:23:17,251 --> 02:23:19,010
they're the biggest,
um,

3234
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:24,890
biggest argument for decreasing deer 
population and also intrigued 

3235
02:23:24,890 --> 02:23:26,700
reintroduction of predators.
In the summer areas,

3236
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:31,910
like some people are talking about like 
bringing in a coyotes and wolves in a 

3237
02:23:31,910 --> 02:23:35,301
certain area like saved yellowstone.
The reintroduction of wolves didn't 

3238
02:23:35,301 --> 02:23:35,650
really,
oh,

3239
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:38,430
that's a very controversial subject.

3240
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:42,120
The shape of the river,
that guy that said that,

3241
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:47,160
that guy who made those amazing videos,
the wolves changed the course of that 

3242
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:47,950
guy,
George to build,

3243
02:23:47,970 --> 02:23:49,920
I think his name is.
I forget how to say his last name.

3244
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:52,980
He's fucking crazy.
Really in a good way,

3245
02:23:52,981 --> 02:23:57,390
but it's like when I found out the coney
guy was like a pedophile.

3246
02:23:58,220 --> 02:24:01,380
That crazy guy,
that guy.

3247
02:24:01,860 --> 02:24:05,430
He was super depressed and was like 
suicidal I guess,

3248
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:10,320
and was was in his midlife and was 
wondering what's the purpose of life?

3249
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:13,470
And got fascinated by the concept of 
rewilding.

3250
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:17,400
He got fascinated by this reintroduction
of predators,

3251
02:24:17,401 --> 02:24:19,650
keystone predators,
and to areas like yellowstone,

3252
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:24,680
which they definitely have their purpose
and they're definitely important to the 

3253
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:26,120
health of the environment.
The,

3254
02:24:26,510 --> 02:24:31,510
the weaker of the thing.
The problem with things like wolves is 

3255
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:35,720
they can get overpopulated as well and 
someone needs to manage them and that's 

3256
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:36,180
where things get weird.

3257
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:40,610
So wildlife biologists have established 
these guidelines when biologists,

3258
02:24:40,700 --> 02:24:44,070
but for humans,
so who nobody was chaos.

3259
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:46,380
Chaos.
First of all,

3260
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:48,570
there was a lot of different animals 
here.

3261
02:24:48,571 --> 02:24:51,570
We're talking about like 10,000
years prior.

3262
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:55,470
There was all these different kinds of 
animals like the short face bear,

3263
02:24:55,980 --> 02:24:58,380
short nose or short face bear.
There was an enormous bare.

3264
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:03,500
There was a step lion that existed in 
America like a long time ago that was 

3265
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:08,391
way bigger than the African lion.
There was all these birds and fucking 

3266
02:25:08,391 --> 02:25:09,630
crazy predators,
terror birds.

3267
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:10,800
So we'll.
We'll go back.

3268
02:25:11,490 --> 02:25:14,370
Thousands and thousands of years.
Even like millions,

3269
02:25:14,371 --> 02:25:19,371
like when the when bulls first and 
there's a bunch of different kinds of 

3270
02:25:19,371 --> 02:25:20,040
wolves and some wolves like the gray 
wolves.

3271
02:25:20,041 --> 02:25:25,041
They left and left North America and 
migrated across the bering strait and 

3272
02:25:25,041 --> 02:25:27,030
then the red wolves and some of the 
other wolf stayed.

3273
02:25:27,090 --> 02:25:32,090
That's why those wolves,
those are the ones that interbreed with 

3274
02:25:32,090 --> 02:25:35,761
coyotes,
but coyotes is actually a wolf or a 

3275
02:25:35,761 --> 02:25:36,160
coyote is a kind of wolf or coyote is 
what's called.

3276
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,560
They used to call them prairie wolves.
It's,

3277
02:25:38,570 --> 02:25:43,570
ah,
there's a guy name Dan Flores who has 

3278
02:25:43,931 --> 02:25:48,931
this amazing paper that he wrote called 
Bison Ecology and bison diplomacy and 

3279
02:25:49,841 --> 02:25:54,841
I'm really groundbreaking paper on 
Bisons and livestock and the wild 

3280
02:25:56,261 --> 02:26:01,261
animals rather,
that live in North America and lived in 

3281
02:26:01,261 --> 02:26:01,960
North America,
but he wrote this new book on coyotes,

3282
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:05,440
coyotes,
and just what the planes used to be like

3283
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:07,210
this.
Why this George Guy,

3284
02:26:07,211 --> 02:26:09,230
this antibiotic guide or say his name 
is.

3285
02:26:09,260 --> 02:26:10,690
Yeah,
the wolves change rivers.

3286
02:26:10,691 --> 02:26:15,691
Guys,
he wants to reintroduce megafauna to 

3287
02:26:15,691 --> 02:26:17,800
Europe like lions because he's saying 
that at one point in time,

3288
02:26:17,801 --> 02:26:22,801
lions and hyenas used to live in Europe 
and that we could use these are large 

3289
02:26:22,801 --> 02:26:26,941
segments of unused land and let these 
animals loose and reintroduce them to 

3290
02:26:26,941 --> 02:26:28,810
this area.
He's out of his fucking mind.

3291
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:30,360
Sounds like a horrible idea.
Well,

3292
02:26:30,370 --> 02:26:30,940
it's,
it's,

3293
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:36,240
it's engineering,
so he doesn't want to just take an 

3294
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:37,870
animal that was extra painted because of
human intervention.

3295
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:41,110
Right?
Wolves were taken out of the wolves were

3296
02:26:41,111 --> 02:26:41,850
poisoned.
Well,

3297
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:43,870
this is what they used to do.
These to take a carcass.

3298
02:26:43,871 --> 02:26:48,070
They would shoot a buffalo and while the
animal is still like barely alive,

3299
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:51,040
they would inject strychnine into it's,
it's,

3300
02:26:51,130 --> 02:26:56,130
uh,
it's arteries and that way it would the 

3301
02:26:56,130 --> 02:26:58,950
poison we get through all of the meat.
Then they would take a wolf that they 

3302
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:02,671
shot and they would rub it set all over 
this carcass so that the wolves knew 

3303
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:05,080
that other wolves had been there.
So it was safe.

3304
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:08,440
They knew it was dead,
it was a dead carcass.

3305
02:27:08,441 --> 02:27:12,160
So they would eat it and they would kill
them and they almost extinguished.

3306
02:27:12,161 --> 02:27:15,970
Wolves almost like came really close to 
extinction wolves in North America.

3307
02:27:16,330 --> 02:27:21,330
They couldn't do that with the coyote 
though the coyotes are too fucking 

3308
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:21,760
smart.
They're too clever because clever.

3309
02:27:21,790 --> 02:27:23,080
Well,
it's because of wolves.

3310
02:27:23,310 --> 02:27:26,980
It's because the gray wolves,
when they returned to North America,

3311
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:32,100
they were killing coyotes.
So the red wolves were interbreeding 

3312
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:32,290
with coyotes,
but the gray wolves were killing them.

3313
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:35,380
So the coyote learned to adapt to the 
gray wolves.

3314
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:37,930
So they learned to move to the furthest 
areas.

3315
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:39,780
They also want.
You hear coyotes yelling.

3316
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:42,450
Yeah,
they're doing a roll call the trinity.

3317
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:45,460
And when they find out that someone's 
missing,

3318
02:27:45,550 --> 02:27:47,830
it triggers the females to have larger 
litters.

3319
02:27:48,470 --> 02:27:49,660
What?
Yeah.

3320
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:49,900
So

3321
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:52,740
I got it.
I want to send you this podcast,

3322
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:55,920
this podcast with Dan Flores.
It's going to blow your.

3323
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:58,990
I hate coyotes burrowing in my yard.
And I have dogs.

3324
02:27:58,991 --> 02:27:59,500
Yeah.
So I had,

3325
02:27:59,501 --> 02:28:03,090
I mean I woke up,
they had dens they made dens in,

3326
02:28:03,091 --> 02:28:08,091
in the back of my yard because I have 
like land and then I have this part up 

3327
02:28:08,091 --> 02:28:10,831
top that don't really go up that much.
And my dog used to just come back with 

3328
02:28:10,831 --> 02:28:11,470
fucking like half plate.
I was like,

3329
02:28:11,471 --> 02:28:14,800
what is going on up there?
I think what she did,

3330
02:28:14,801 --> 02:28:17,230
I think that she's up to now.
Um,

3331
02:28:17,231 --> 02:28:18,550
one's even bigger,
but one's a pit bull.

3332
02:28:18,551 --> 02:28:22,210
I think what she did was she would chase
one and then it will go under

3333
02:28:22,210 --> 02:28:23,510
the.
Because you realize the vampire they can

3334
02:28:23,511 --> 02:28:24,830
fly.
I mean they can,

3335
02:28:24,890 --> 02:28:27,440
they can clear Julie's to get a coyote 
fence in your yard.

3336
02:28:27,441 --> 02:28:30,650
It has to go three feet into the ground 
in seven feet tall.

3337
02:28:30,651 --> 02:28:31,920
They can,
they can jump.

3338
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:37,370
I've seen it.
I actually stole my chicken and I want 

3339
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:37,370
you to jump over the fence with chicken 
and rice.

3340
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:40,160
The coyote stole a baby and I think 
Arizona off of the porch.

3341
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:43,010
I mean,
they're fucking barbarians.

3342
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:46,110
And uh,
the by two encounters one time I,

3343
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:51,160
they were drinking out of my pool and I 
came outside and I literally opened the 

3344
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:51,160
door and they just looked at me like,
what?

3345
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:53,360
Whoa.
I had to chase them.

3346
02:28:53,450 --> 02:28:55,580
Okay.
And I saw one jump over my fence.

3347
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:58,040
I mean,
it's gotta be five and six feet tall.

3348
02:28:58,041 --> 02:28:59,140
I mean,
it's totally boring.

3349
02:28:59,450 --> 02:29:02,330
And I literally said cards.
It's fucking Wiley Coyote.

3350
02:29:02,570 --> 02:29:03,260
And then I was like,
Oh God,

3351
02:29:03,261 --> 02:29:08,261
I gotta call animal control.
I'm gonna have this fucking dead broken 

3352
02:29:08,261 --> 02:29:08,261
coyote on the other side.
I go in the other side,

3353
02:29:08,261 --> 02:29:09,170
it's just gone.
Flew off.

3354
02:29:09,560 --> 02:29:11,000
And Oh,
they were explaining to me.

3355
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:11,540
I was like,
well,

3356
02:29:11,541 --> 02:29:12,380
look,
if there's a coyote,

3357
02:29:12,381 --> 02:29:13,460
I'm going to hear them,
you know,

3358
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:14,750
killing my dog.

3359
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:15,720
I'll be able to hear it,
you know,

3360
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:16,790
I'll just leave the door open.
He goes,

3361
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:17,010
oh,
no,

3362
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:17,840
no.
You don't understand.

3363
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:19,970
Coyote is work because they're so 
cunning.

3364
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:25,300
The way that they kill a larger animal 
is they befriend it first so it'll play 

3365
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:29,600
with your dog for 45 minutes and then 
the other five will descend around it so

3366
02:29:29,601 --> 02:29:34,601
it ingratiates it knows I need to 
ingratiate myself with you first and 

3367
02:29:34,601 --> 02:29:38,771
then kill you and they tire them out,
so this happens a lot in runyon canyon.

3368
02:29:38,961 --> 02:29:43,961
People's dogs.
They'll just see him chasing the coyote 

3369
02:29:43,961 --> 02:29:46,091
and then the coyotes will just run and 
run and run until the dog is tired and 

3370
02:29:46,091 --> 02:29:47,600
then everyone will descend there and 
they're hungry and they're desperate and

3371
02:29:47,601 --> 02:29:50,040
there do not give a fuck.
A friend of mine up,

3372
02:29:50,100 --> 02:29:55,100
Heaney was walking his dog like a small 
dog and a saw a coyote face to face and 

3373
02:29:55,881 --> 02:29:59,710
picked up his dog and the like had to 
like flex on it to get it to run away.

3374
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:03,080
Started walking again back to his house.
He was like 20 feet from his house.

3375
02:30:03,081 --> 02:30:05,330
He turned around.
The coyote had come back with four other

3376
02:30:05,340 --> 02:30:10,340
coyotes.
They are just fearless and they live 

3377
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:13,230
amongst us a little fucking monsters 
live.

3378
02:30:13,340 --> 02:30:15,800
I mean,
I have like compassion for them.

3379
02:30:15,801 --> 02:30:18,110
If it's between my dog and a coyote,
I'll,

3380
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:20,930
you know,
kill a coyote with my hands.

3381
02:30:20,931 --> 02:30:22,700
But it's,
it's really sad when you're like,

3382
02:30:22,701 --> 02:30:23,120
yeah,
dude,

3383
02:30:23,121 --> 02:30:25,610
I'm so sorry this was your fucking 
house.

3384
02:30:25,670 --> 02:30:27,500
But it's not.
It's never been really.

3385
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:31,030
It's just constant domination.
The rats didn't own it.

3386
02:30:31,031 --> 02:30:32,830
They're killing rats.
The Rats House,

3387
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:34,420
the code is a killing.
The rafts are stealing.

3388
02:30:34,430 --> 02:30:36,880
The rest of was trying to convince me 
that rats are really smart.

3389
02:30:36,970 --> 02:30:38,800
Rats are pretty smart,
but coyotes eat them.

3390
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:41,560
If we didn't have coyotes,
we would have way more.

3391
02:30:41,561 --> 02:30:46,561
Rats.
We would have a huge rodent problem all 

3392
02:30:46,561 --> 02:30:46,561
throughout Los Angeles.
Rods in my pool all the time.

3393
02:30:46,561 --> 02:30:51,480
My daughter.
There's a balance that has to be 

3394
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:51,480
achieved and that's why wolves are 
really important.

3395
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:56,341
Like the people that think that we 
should re extra pate wolves and wiped 

3396
02:30:56,341 --> 02:30:56,341
them out.
Definitely not.

3397
02:30:56,341 --> 02:30:58,560
But if you look at some of the things 
that have happened,

3398
02:30:59,530 --> 02:31:01,570
yes,
gray wolves do gray wolf,

3399
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:03,640
gray wolves don't interbreed with 
coyotes,

3400
02:31:03,700 --> 02:31:06,610
but red wolves do.
So gray wolves killed coyotes.

3401
02:31:06,611 --> 02:31:11,611
So where they've reintroduced wolves.
That's another interesting thing about 

3402
02:31:11,611 --> 02:31:12,550
yellowstone that you reintroduced the 
wolves to yellowstone.

3403
02:31:12,550 --> 02:31:17,550
They dropped the coyote population down 
50 percent because the gray wolves were 

3404
02:31:17,550 --> 02:31:19,110
killing the coyotes,
but because when you kill coyotes and do

3405
02:31:19,111 --> 02:31:21,420
the roll call thing,
the females are larger letters.

3406
02:31:21,630 --> 02:31:26,630
They rebounded and now are more coyotes 
in yellowstone than were before they 

3407
02:31:27,661 --> 02:31:31,210
reintroduced the wolves.
They're so fucking adapted.

3408
02:31:31,230 --> 02:31:32,310
Their amazing.
Well,

3409
02:31:32,311 --> 02:31:36,270
I mean I also just love that dogs were 
wolves wants and just they just.

3410
02:31:36,271 --> 02:31:41,271
Some coyotes survive.
Survival is can still breed with dogs 

3411
02:31:41,271 --> 02:31:41,271
just like wolves can.
Yeah.

3412
02:31:41,271 --> 02:31:42,510
It's just survival of the friendliest.
They realized like,

3413
02:31:42,511 --> 02:31:47,511
Oh,
and then so wolves evolved to be dogs 

3414
02:31:47,511 --> 02:31:50,990
and then realized to protect us.
They could survive and now they protect 

3415
02:31:50,990 --> 02:31:50,990
us against wolves.
Yeah.

3416
02:31:50,990 --> 02:31:54,060
How the fuck did that ever happen to.
Like I said,

3417
02:31:54,061 --> 02:31:56,250
Neil degrasse Tyson did his,
his cosmos.

3418
02:31:56,251 --> 02:31:59,040
He did that thing about it.
That was kind of short but sorta.

3419
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,190
But you still like God damn it.
Yeah.

3420
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,300
How did it become a poodle?
Whoa.

3421
02:32:03,380 --> 02:32:05,970
Fuck.
Did the Afro,

3422
02:32:05,971 --> 02:32:08,020
like how was it was like a genetic 
mutation.

3423
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:13,040
Then we really latched onto,
well I think it's also the cutest ones 

3424
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:13,040
are the ones that survived.
Right,

3425
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:13,920
because they're the ones.
Yeah.

3426
02:32:13,921 --> 02:32:15,210
Cute.
Sweet.

3427
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,880
And the ugly ones are the ones that got 
weeded out.

3428
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:23,020
Yeah,
but the balance that this George 

3429
02:32:23,020 --> 02:32:23,070
Monbiot,
I think that's how you say his name,

3430
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:26,910
like his,
his take on wolves,

3431
02:32:26,911 --> 02:32:31,911
turning like the people love that video 
because he's English and he's got a 

3432
02:32:31,911 --> 02:32:33,690
beautiful voice.
Fascinating story.

3433
02:32:33,691 --> 02:32:35,140
And it's interesting.
Yeah.

3434
02:32:35,610 --> 02:32:37,410
Well there's a lot of truth to what he's
saying.

3435
02:32:37,650 --> 02:32:42,650
Like it's important to have keystone 
predators because they keep the 

3436
02:32:42,650 --> 02:32:43,840
populations of these game animals or you
know,

3437
02:32:43,850 --> 02:32:48,850
like wild undulates,
the keep them healthy because they 

3438
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:50,730
control them.
But when wolves get to populated,

3439
02:32:50,731 --> 02:32:53,940
they get crazy and they do what they 
call surplus killing.

3440
02:32:54,130 --> 02:32:59,130
Like they killed 19 elk recently in 
Wyoming and they didn't need any of 

3441
02:32:59,130 --> 02:33:02,811
them.
They just went on this butchering ron 

3442
02:33:02,811 --> 02:33:02,811
and just kill.
It was.

3443
02:33:02,811 --> 02:33:06,060
They were.
They come over the top of a hill and 

3444
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:06,060
they see a herd of elk.
Have you?

3445
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:06,330
Have you ever seen a herd of elk are 
amazing.

3446
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:08,460
Sometimes they're huge.
Sometimes a herd of elk,

3447
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:11,400
maybe a hundred,
200 strong and it's amazing.

3448
02:33:11,401 --> 02:33:16,401
You'll come over a hill.
I've only seen maybe 30 of them 

3449
02:33:16,401 --> 02:33:17,340
together,
but it's quite a sight.

3450
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:22,400
It's amazing.
Like you're just fucking 30 of them 

3451
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:22,400
together.
And we were,

3452
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,480
we came over the top of this hill and we
were like,

3453
02:33:24,530 --> 02:33:24,960
Whoa,
Whoa,

3454
02:33:24,961 --> 02:33:26,010
Whoa,
look at.

3455
02:33:26,450 --> 02:33:29,910
And then she's heard of my old,
you know,

3456
02:33:29,911 --> 02:33:34,480
500 to a thousand pound forest cows that
are wandering it.

3457
02:33:34,481 --> 02:33:34,920
Look,
there's a

3458
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:40,610
good.
I saw Moose in Jackson Hall and I was 

3459
02:33:40,610 --> 02:33:41,760
like,
that's rare because those are all bowls.

3460
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:45,810
Female smells around amongst them.
So wolves.

3461
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:47,700
I saw Moose,
Moose,

3462
02:33:47,730 --> 02:33:49,410
and the guy,
the guy that was.

3463
02:33:49,411 --> 02:33:51,300
We were doing a little thing on the 
skull.

3464
02:33:51,301 --> 02:33:52,650
The Snake River,
I don't know.

3465
02:33:52,651 --> 02:33:55,710
Jackson hole was explaining how most cal
bears.

3466
02:33:56,320 --> 02:33:59,100
You kick them.
It's so fucked up.

3467
02:33:59,460 --> 02:34:02,010
I think he said there was a video 
somewhere of it.

3468
02:34:02,011 --> 02:34:02,370
I,
I,

3469
02:34:02,371 --> 02:34:07,371
I'm too terrified to look at it.
That they wait because they obviously 

3470
02:34:07,371 --> 02:34:08,490
can't fight the thing.
They wait till the bears.

3471
02:34:08,491 --> 02:34:10,200
Yeah.
Running up on them and they just wait,

3472
02:34:10,201 --> 02:34:10,730
wait,
wait,

3473
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:15,740
don't get the last minute.
Just basically knock their head off 

3474
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:15,740
their bodies.

3475
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:16,800
Fifteen percent of all wolves that die 
get killed by.

3476
02:34:17,860 --> 02:34:18,160
That's

3477
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:19,060
amazing.
Yeah.

3478
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:22,060
Fifteen percent.
That's the mortality rate of wolves.

3479
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:26,110
That's fucking crazy moves.
Don't give a fuck.

3480
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,970
They don't give a fuck.
I didn't realize how big.

3481
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:31,180
I mean they're just like tanks.
Oh my God.

3482
02:34:31,370 --> 02:34:33,790
They're fast.
They're huge.

3483
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:34,480
Yeah.
You're just like,

3484
02:34:34,481 --> 02:34:39,481
what is the first time I saw one?
We were hunting them in BC and we saw 

3485
02:34:39,481 --> 02:34:40,810
this female and it was like that seem 
drastic park.

3486
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:43,420
When Jeff Goldbloom sees the dynamo sore
for the first time,

3487
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:49,140
we were like maybe like five or 600 
yards away from them and we opened up 

3488
02:34:49,140 --> 02:34:51,460
the window,
looked outside and there were huge

3489
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:54,050
wandering through this field and you 
know,

3490
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:59,080
they're living in a dark,
dark place where we found one that had 

3491
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:02,321
been killed,
a calf that had been killed by wolves 

3492
02:35:02,321 --> 02:35:02,321
and it would have been,
had been killed hours earlier.

3493
02:35:02,321 --> 02:35:04,550
It was fairly fresh.
It was a crazy scene.

3494
02:35:04,551 --> 02:35:09,551
I put it up on instagram and it's such a
strange scene because there's this 

3495
02:35:09,551 --> 02:35:09,551
carcass,

3496
02:35:09,551 --> 02:35:12,140
but there's hair everywhere,
like everywhere.

3497
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:15,990
They just show the hair.
You can find it.

3498
02:35:16,050 --> 02:35:19,980
Jamie was like a probably a year old.
It's old instagram picture,

3499
02:35:20,130 --> 02:35:25,130
but the picture was,
it was when we got there because we saw 

3500
02:35:25,130 --> 02:35:25,250
these,
um,

3501
02:35:25,350 --> 02:35:27,330
these crows,
some circling.

3502
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:32,440
It was all crows and there were 
squawking and we walked up on it and we 

3503
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:36,231
found this thing just devastated.
But it's so eerie to think that there's 

3504
02:35:36,231 --> 02:35:40,521
these wild roaming.
Pat Canadian wolves are just wild as 

3505
02:35:40,521 --> 02:35:40,521
fuck.
They've never been extricated.

3506
02:35:40,521 --> 02:35:45,520
They've always.
These are the same rules that they 

3507
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:46,860
brought into yellowstone were actually 
Canadian walls that gray North American,

3508
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:51,920
uh,
United States gray walls were actually 

3509
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:51,920
smaller than the ones they brought from 
Canada.

3510
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:55,170
Because mammals,
when mammals come from colder climates,

3511
02:35:55,260 --> 02:35:58,590
they have larger bodies.
That's why move somewhere away.

3512
02:35:58,740 --> 02:35:58,980
Again,

3513
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:03,630
this is a bare fucking gangster,
sir.

3514
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:07,920
As barbwire on the fence,
this thing climbed at 12 foot high.

3515
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:10,230
They don't know how it did it.
Come to 12 foot high fence.

3516
02:36:10,610 --> 02:36:13,530
Got fucking Koala bear.
Oh God.

3517
02:36:13,570 --> 02:36:15,950
Just seeing that thing like,
Huh,

3518
02:36:16,730 --> 02:36:18,360
zoo,
I thought it was fucking saved.

3519
02:36:18,390 --> 02:36:23,310
That thing should be in the fucking zoo.
Like why is that how you got out?

3520
02:36:23,370 --> 02:36:25,110
No,
fuck that out.

3521
02:36:25,111 --> 02:36:30,111
And got in their lives.
It's an la celebrity even before 

3522
02:36:30,331 --> 02:36:32,460
becoming a lead suspect and quality 
killing.

3523
02:36:32,750 --> 02:36:35,610
Just a month of poison.
No,

3524
02:36:35,611 --> 02:36:40,080
it's pretty recently.
Just it doesn't have a collar on because

3525
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:41,160
they're touching it,
right?

3526
02:36:41,310 --> 02:36:42,140
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3527
02:36:42,150 --> 02:36:43,070
It's got a collar.
Yeah.

3528
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:43,470
Yeah,
they,

3529
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:48,500
they are tracking it.
His name is [inaudible] to give him a 

3530
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:48,600
name,
like he's a fucking prisoner.

3531
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:53,130
How about Cuban name for Fred Before I.
Oh God,

3532
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:55,410
don't.
Koalas was missing.

3533
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:02,220
You're sad that the parents are not even
from the same fucking continent.

3534
02:37:03,230 --> 02:37:05,660
What is,
what if,

3535
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:11,600
can you imagine this call has never seen
a fucking mountain lion and it's life 

3536
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:11,600
probably.
Oh No,

3537
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:12,510
definitely not.
And it's like,

3538
02:37:12,550 --> 02:37:17,550
what the fuck?
You probably saw that one game of 

3539
02:37:17,550 --> 02:37:17,550
thrones.

3540
02:37:17,550 --> 02:37:17,550
Yeah,
exactly.

3541
02:37:17,550 --> 02:37:17,750
That's true.
But um,

3542
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:22,840
before the fake poisoning of it,
maybe I'm conflating it with something 

3543
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:26,741
else,
but I was probably other ones who have 

3544
02:37:26,741 --> 02:37:26,741
been poisoned or something cause they 
were saying,

3545
02:37:26,741 --> 02:37:30,020
stop putting poison out on your lawn 
because fucking kill monsters.

3546
02:37:30,021 --> 02:37:32,390
Yeah.
You're your into Kelly's awesome.

3547
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:34,960
A broken murderers.
Um,

3548
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:36,200
is that uh,
okay.

3549
02:37:36,201 --> 02:37:41,201
So a friend of mine was hiking in 
Griffith Park and her dog came back 

3550
02:37:41,201 --> 02:37:42,400
covered in like innards of it,
like deer enter.

3551
02:37:42,401 --> 02:37:43,510
It's like,
like,

3552
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:47,290
I mean like literally had like,
like in trails up all,

3553
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:52,300
like wrapped around it.
The nose and the mountain lion had 

3554
02:37:52,300 --> 02:37:52,580
killed deer and the dog roll around in 
it.

3555
02:37:53,300 --> 02:37:56,360
Why does a dog roll around in a dead 
animal?

3556
02:37:56,450 --> 02:37:58,010
They always do that.
Those are fun.

3557
02:37:58,011 --> 02:38:01,220
A dead squirrel in the road.
Get the scent on it.

3558
02:38:01,690 --> 02:38:06,690
I'm not really sure because it actually 
makes me think it would make another 

3559
02:38:06,690 --> 02:38:08,320
animal one to attack you if you smell 
like blood and in or it's.

3560
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:11,330
I think they know you're not dead.
But I do know my dog.

3561
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:16,360
Another dead body is awesome.
Same outline.

3562
02:38:16,881 --> 02:38:19,480
It's got poisoned but it didn't die.
Okay.

3563
02:38:19,490 --> 02:38:20,530
So I'm not a total.
Okay.

3564
02:38:20,531 --> 02:38:20,750
Poster

3565
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:24,260
cat for California's rat poison problem.
Well,

3566
02:38:24,290 --> 02:38:25,500
you know,
there's two options.

3567
02:38:25,501 --> 02:38:29,190
You poisoned the rats or you invite more
coyotes to lived near your house.

3568
02:38:29,850 --> 02:38:31,410
You know,
they say when they eat dog cats.

3569
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:33,150
Tony too.
It's also in the damn floor.

3570
02:38:33,151 --> 02:38:35,430
His podcast.
He talks about how when they eat dogs,

3571
02:38:35,431 --> 02:38:39,720
they're not really eating dogs because 
they want to eat them for like a meal as

3572
02:38:39,721 --> 02:38:41,760
much as they want to eliminate 
predators,

3573
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:47,240
like competing predators,
especially with cats because most of 

3574
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:48,540
what they eat like a coyote,
Z,

3575
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:51,060
like a lot of bugs that eat a lot of 
grasshoppers.

3576
02:38:51,061 --> 02:38:53,130
They eat a lot of rats.
They ate a lot of rodents,

3577
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:55,180
rabbits.
But they.

3578
02:38:55,270 --> 02:39:00,270
The cat's compete with them because cats
are a fucking murderers and now.

3579
02:39:00,301 --> 02:39:03,870
But they this shit about how many cats 
do you see that off my instagram page,

3580
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:07,530
this article that I posted,
but how many fucking birds and mammals?

3581
02:39:07,530 --> 02:39:12,530
Cats kill the US alone every year.
Just cass house cats there.

3582
02:39:14,270 --> 02:39:17,340
There's billions in the b.
look at this.

3583
02:39:17,610 --> 02:39:22,610
Responsible for the deaths of one point 
four to three point 7 billion birds and 

3584
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:27,051
six point nine to 20 point 7 billion 
mammals every year in the mammal.

3585
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:29,880
Squirrels,
squirrels,

3586
02:39:29,881 --> 02:39:31,710
whatever.
When I was a kid,

3587
02:39:31,711 --> 02:39:34,220
I had this cat and he,
um,

3588
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:37,170
he killed a squirrel and he was walking.
He,

3589
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:42,260
we lived across the street from this 
park and this cat killed this squirrel 

3590
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:44,130
and had it inbetween his.
He had a bit.

3591
02:39:44,190 --> 02:39:48,390
He bit his neck and had its body 
underneath his body.

3592
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:51,570
So he's walking with this weekend at 
Bernie's,

3593
02:39:51,571 --> 02:39:56,571
dragging it,
holding onto it and like having to walk 

3594
02:39:56,571 --> 02:39:57,690
around the.
Oh yeah.

3595
02:39:57,691 --> 02:40:00,600
We called this kitty like my cows named 
kitty.

3596
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:03,810
Like that was his name.
Like we had a name for my name to him,

3597
02:40:03,811 --> 02:40:08,811
like Conan the barbarian.
The comic books had like a lion that he 

3598
02:40:08,811 --> 02:40:11,850
has had a Jaguar as a pet.
I forget what his name was.

3599
02:40:11,851 --> 02:40:13,980
I named it that my like,
shut the fuck up.

3600
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:16,140
So you know,
no one in my house.

3601
02:40:16,750 --> 02:40:18,420
So it became,
his name was kitty,

3602
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:20,790
but Katie was like,
I had a big black hat.

3603
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:23,380
Cats are sociopaths.
Murderer ever.

3604
02:40:23,510 --> 02:40:24,310
See when,
uh,

3605
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:29,450
when Tippi hedren came out,
because remember she like raised lions 

3606
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:30,630
and Melanie Griffith grew up with lions 
and shit in the house.

3607
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:32,010
Oh yeah.
Google Tippi.

3608
02:40:32,011 --> 02:40:33,650
Hedren lions.
Yeah.

3609
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:36,360
What the fuck.
And she recently came out and was like,

3610
02:40:36,390 --> 02:40:38,580
that was a horrible idea.
That was a mistake.

3611
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:43,800
It was super dangerous.
Like one of them I think cut up Melania 

3612
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:45,060
Griffin had to have surgery on it 
because one of them bought her like,

3613
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:50,300
yes.
So she grew up with these things in her 

3614
02:40:50,300 --> 02:40:50,300
hats.
Melanie Griffith?

3615
02:40:50,300 --> 02:40:50,300
Nope.
That's Tippi hedren her mom.

3616
02:40:50,300 --> 02:40:50,650
What?
What?

3617
02:40:50,810 --> 02:40:53,670
So just go through it.
Which has a fucking pet lion.

3618
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:56,160
No,
she had tons of them here.

3619
02:40:56,190 --> 02:40:57,270
Keep going,
keep going.

3620
02:40:57,271 --> 02:41:02,271
And you'll see more and more.
So how do they do that and not get 

3621
02:41:02,271 --> 02:41:02,271
killed?
These motherfuckers will,

3622
02:41:02,271 --> 02:41:04,170
you have to raise them from infancy?
Look at their.

3623
02:41:04,171 --> 02:41:08,130
I mean they have tiger because they're 
part of the pack or like a pride.

3624
02:41:08,131 --> 02:41:13,131
I guess it would be.
But what if they just decided to play 

3625
02:41:13,131 --> 02:41:13,260
with any moment at any moment,
at any moment?

3626
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:16,260
Look on the kids.
They could.

3627
02:41:16,261 --> 02:41:21,261
And they did.
So they try to make a movie out of it 

3628
02:41:21,261 --> 02:41:22,080
and one of the cameramen got his face 
ripped off and they were like,

3629
02:41:22,081 --> 02:41:24,190
nevermind.
Anxiety.

3630
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:27,150
I know.
Because you know that there sociopathic.

3631
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:28,520
I think if he's not social

3632
02:41:28,580 --> 02:41:30,110
pathic,
they just natural.

3633
02:41:30,111 --> 02:41:34,610
That's the look.
They have all of these reward mechanisms

3634
02:41:34,611 --> 02:41:39,611
that are built into their DNA.
They feel good when they chase after 

3635
02:41:39,611 --> 02:41:40,420
things and kill them.
They need to hunt.

3636
02:41:40,550 --> 02:41:43,370
That's part of the problem with zoos,
is it these things?

3637
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:47,720
It's like,
it's like extracting a guys come through

3638
02:41:47,721 --> 02:41:48,700
a straw.
Yeah,

3639
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:49,250
yeah,
yeah.

3640
02:41:49,270 --> 02:41:49,790
Like,
oh,

3641
02:41:49,820 --> 02:41:51,090
I know you need to get rid of your 
comms,

3642
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:53,990
but you're still horny.
Does that make sense?

3643
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:54,850
Part of that,
yes.

3644
02:41:54,851 --> 02:41:56,950
That's part of the like hunting and will
you got to.

3645
02:41:57,170 --> 02:41:58,990
I'm with you.
I'm actually with you on that.

3646
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:00,610
This is crazy.
It's crazy.

3647
02:42:00,760 --> 02:42:03,310
It's fucking crazy.
And she came out recently and was like,

3648
02:42:03,311 --> 02:42:04,210
Nah,
nevermind.

3649
02:42:04,211 --> 02:42:09,211
I'm really don't endorse doing that.
How did she get rid of the lions when 

3650
02:42:09,211 --> 02:42:09,640
she still has them?
You know what?

3651
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:15,030
I was trying to organize going to her 
because she has like a sanctuary and she

3652
02:42:15,031 --> 02:42:20,031
tries to raise money to save lions.
I mean because you know now like an 

3653
02:42:20,031 --> 02:42:22,451
Africa,
there's more animals in captivity than 

3654
02:42:22,451 --> 02:42:22,451
they are on the wild.
Like it's such a problem.

3655
02:42:22,451 --> 02:42:23,100
Yes,
but.

3656
02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:28,190
But that captivity,
we're talking about high fence 

3657
02:42:28,190 --> 02:42:29,350
operations that are sometimes a hundred 
thousand plus acres.

3658
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:29,920
Yeah.
Many,

3659
02:42:29,921 --> 02:42:30,850
many,
many square miles.

3660
02:42:30,851 --> 02:42:35,851
So you look at the actual range that 
aligned would inhabit and oftentimes 

3661
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:40,980
it's much smaller than what we're 
calling like a pejorative way.

3662
02:42:41,351 --> 02:42:43,270
It's like they're not safe.
Well,

3663
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:44,980
they're fenced in.
Let's see.

3664
02:42:45,430 --> 02:42:48,460
One of the fucking crazy catch 22 is 
about Africa.

3665
02:42:48,610 --> 02:42:49,760
Is that Lou?
Do you know?

3666
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:53,020
Louis through documentary and I've 
listened to him on your show.

3667
02:42:53,080 --> 02:42:56,020
Did you watch his documentary on African
Hunter?

3668
02:42:56,380 --> 02:43:00,670
It's fucking crazy.
But many of the animals that people hunt

3669
02:43:00,700 --> 02:43:05,700
in Africa,
we're very close to extinction just a 

3670
02:43:05,800 --> 02:43:10,800
few decades ago when they put value on 
them and they set up these hunting 

3671
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:14,431
camps.
Now they're in there in higher 

3672
02:43:14,431 --> 02:43:17,131
populations than ever before,
but they're in higher populations 

3673
02:43:17,131 --> 02:43:17,131
because people go over there to hunt 
them,

3674
02:43:17,350 --> 02:43:20,110
so they have these places where you go 
and it's kind of fucked up.

3675
02:43:20,110 --> 02:43:22,090
Like there's a waterhole,
you sit it in front of a waterhole,

3676
02:43:22,091 --> 02:43:23,280
they have a blind,
you hide in,

3677
02:43:23,290 --> 02:43:25,240
the blind animal comes down,
you shoot it,

3678
02:43:25,450 --> 02:43:28,270
and it's all trapped in a.
well,

3679
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:30,370
I mean it isn't.
It isn't.

3680
02:43:31,180 --> 02:43:31,930
It isn't.
It isn't.

3681
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:36,340
It's certainly not like target practice.
It's more that than anything else.

3682
02:43:36,370 --> 02:43:37,210
So it's.
Is it,

3683
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:42,570
is it better to go and get a steak from 
an animal that lived in captivity or is 

3684
02:43:43,781 --> 02:43:46,480
it better to shoot an animal as it goes 
to get water?

3685
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:49,240
Well,
it's not as good as going to the woods.

3686
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:51,850
Like you go into the woods,
you go shoot a wild elk.

3687
02:43:51,970 --> 02:43:56,970
That elk does.
It might not even know what a fucking 

3688
02:43:56,970 --> 02:43:59,131
person is,
hopefully doesn't even see you coming 

3689
02:43:59,131 --> 02:44:02,460
and you shoot it and kill it.
That's like the ultimate goal is to 

3690
02:44:02,460 --> 02:44:04,750
instantaneously and this wild existence 
that if you didn't kill it,

3691
02:44:04,870 --> 02:44:08,260
it would be killed by bears or wolves or
something else.

3692
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:11,260
That's the idea,
but or they freeze to death or they kill

3693
02:44:11,261 --> 02:44:13,060
each other.
There's a lot of killing each other.

3694
02:44:13,270 --> 02:44:14,240
These,
these,

3695
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:17,410
these antlers.
They're not like for digging for fruit.

3696
02:44:19,310 --> 02:44:21,010
That's why they have them and each 
other.

3697
02:44:21,450 --> 02:44:22,600
I mean,
that's why they have them.

3698
02:44:22,650 --> 02:44:23,530
I mean,
you see this deer,

3699
02:44:23,531 --> 02:44:26,680
that's why he has it to kill other deer 
so he can get all the pussy.

3700
02:44:27,030 --> 02:44:28,180
That's literally what it.
Therefore,

3701
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:29,620
it's a knife that grows out of your 
head,

3702
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:35,340
so it's not fascinating.
But what's crazy is these animals were 

3703
02:44:35,340 --> 02:44:38,590
worth nothing and they were being 
slaughtered by poachers.

3704
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:39,370
And then you go,
well,

3705
02:44:39,371 --> 02:44:40,090
these poachers,
man,

3706
02:44:40,091 --> 02:44:41,620
that's fucked up.
Yes,

3707
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:46,330
but they're really fucking poor.
So what do you do about that?

3708
02:44:46,510 --> 02:44:51,510
Because you have these people that are 
living over there that there have to 

3709
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:53,050
risk their lives to try to poach these 
animals for meat,

3710
02:44:53,290 --> 02:44:53,920
for food.

3711
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:58,920
And then there's the fucking,
the horrible trade like rhinos and 

3712
02:44:58,920 --> 02:44:59,340
candles.
I mean,

3713
02:44:59,360 --> 02:45:02,020
it's like it's like saying to a drug 
addict stopped doing heroin.

3714
02:45:02,021 --> 02:45:07,021
It's like,
well you have to replace it with 

3715
02:45:07,021 --> 02:45:07,021
something in the narcotics anonymous or 
another drug or something.

3716
02:45:07,021 --> 02:45:08,170
So you can't say stop poaching without 
like,

3717
02:45:08,171 --> 02:45:13,171
okay,
there's no other way to fucking make 

3718
02:45:13,171 --> 02:45:13,171
money.
Exactly.

3719
02:45:13,171 --> 02:45:13,171
There.
The poverty is insane.

3720
02:45:13,171 --> 02:45:17,881
I have had friends that have gone over 
to Africa and one of the things that 

3721
02:45:17,881 --> 02:45:18,970
they say is you just like my friend 
Justin Wren,

3722
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:23,920
who he goes to the Congo stays there for
months at a time and he's building wells

3723
02:45:23,921 --> 02:45:24,880
over there.
He's amazing guy.

3724
02:45:24,881 --> 02:45:27,010
He's the guy who just got malaria for 
the second time.

3725
02:45:27,011 --> 02:45:32,011
It's like you don't even understand what
poverty is until you see how these 

3726
02:45:32,011 --> 02:45:32,590
people live.
These poor people.

3727
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:35,380
So I don't blame them for poaching.

3728
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:36,700
I mean,
and if it becomes,

3729
02:45:36,820 --> 02:45:40,750
if it goes,
if it's between selling a rhino horn and

3730
02:45:40,751 --> 02:45:44,030
feeding your child,
it's like fuck man.

3731
02:45:44,031 --> 02:45:49,031
Not Online.
Like looking at the statistics about 

3732
02:45:49,031 --> 02:45:49,031
animals.
They're literally,

3733
02:45:49,031 --> 02:45:49,400
it's just it.
Taylor be killed.

3734
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:52,360
They're barely making it.
They're barely making it.

3735
02:45:52,510 --> 02:45:57,510
I mean,
I am 100 percent against killing rhinos 

3736
02:45:57,510 --> 02:45:57,510
for their horns.
Make no mistake about it.

3737
02:45:57,510 --> 02:45:58,630
I think it's horrible and it's 
disgusting.

3738
02:45:58,900 --> 02:46:01,060
But these people that were calling 
poachers,

3739
02:46:01,270 --> 02:46:01,950
you know,
you,

3740
02:46:01,951 --> 02:46:03,430
you,
you add that pejorative,

3741
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:04,020
you know,
you,

3742
02:46:04,021 --> 02:46:06,930
you give them that label and you take 
away.

3743
02:46:07,220 --> 02:46:10,010
They could do it like,
like a poor people.

3744
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:13,460
They're desperate poor people and 
they're not making that much money.

3745
02:46:13,550 --> 02:46:16,610
The people actually kill a rhino.
They're not making much money.

3746
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:19,340
They were making a few hundred dollars 
or whatever the fuck they can get.

3747
02:46:19,460 --> 02:46:24,460
They're selling it to someone else and 
that other person is making a fuck load 

3748
02:46:24,460 --> 02:46:26,030
of money and it's all gross.
It's gross and it's all scary.

3749
02:46:26,210 --> 02:46:31,210
But the Louis Theroux documentary does 
the best job of highlighting how fucked 

3750
02:46:31,461 --> 02:46:36,461
it is over there.
And it's one of the things that the guy 

3751
02:46:36,461 --> 02:46:38,411
who runs the camp says to them,
because Louise like constantly 

3752
02:46:38,411 --> 02:46:38,620
pastoring,
I'm badgering him as what does,

3753
02:46:38,690 --> 02:46:39,370
why does it plays?
Well,

3754
02:46:39,371 --> 02:46:44,371
how are you doing?
He's like giving them all these 

3755
02:46:44,371 --> 02:46:44,660
questions and finally the guy snaps and 
he's like,

3756
02:46:44,661 --> 02:46:46,280
after I got,
he's fucked.

3757
02:46:46,370 --> 02:46:49,520
You don't understand Africa,
he fucked.

3758
02:46:49,790 --> 02:46:54,790
He goes,
if these fucking animals are not worth 

3759
02:46:54,790 --> 02:46:54,790
something,
they'd be gone.

3760
02:46:54,790 --> 02:46:58,810
Do you understand this?
This really crazy moment where you 

3761
02:46:59,481 --> 02:47:04,481
realize the problem is not as simple as 
why do people want to go over there and 

3762
02:47:04,481 --> 02:47:07,430
hunt?
The problem is this breakdown of what we

3763
02:47:07,431 --> 02:47:12,431
call civilization in this area where you
have people that are impossibly poor and

3764
02:47:12,921 --> 02:47:17,921
they're surrounded by animals and the 
only value of around them as animals.

3765
02:47:18,410 --> 02:47:20,540
It's so crazy.
It's so crazy,

3766
02:47:21,050 --> 02:47:26,050
so fucking crazy.
So it's either you're involved in the 

3767
02:47:26,050 --> 02:47:29,321
tourism business that has people coming 
to look at these animals or you just 

3768
02:47:29,321 --> 02:47:29,810
have to fucking kill.
And by the way,

3769
02:47:29,811 --> 02:47:32,870
the tourism industry is not as fucking 
profitable as the.

3770
02:47:33,580 --> 02:47:38,580
It's just not because it.
If you want to go over there and kill a 

3771
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:38,580
lion,
it costs you $50,000.

3772
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:43,480
And what's really fucked up is these 
lions now in Zimbabwe where that cecil 

3773
02:47:43,480 --> 02:47:45,920
the lion was killed.
They're killing 200 of them.

3774
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:47,600
They're just going to poach them,
not poach them,

3775
02:47:47,700 --> 02:47:52,700
just going assassinate them because they
have too many and now the lions are 

3776
02:47:52,700 --> 02:47:54,980
destroying all the unduly population.
They had a balance that they had created

3777
02:47:54,981 --> 02:47:59,981
through hunting lions down there like 
coyotes or will like here with the 

3778
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:02,380
fucking lions.
Look,

3779
02:48:02,390 --> 02:48:04,850
they're amazing.
Lions are incredible.

3780
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:10,510
Look,
I saw that thing you posted of the lion 

3781
02:48:10,510 --> 02:48:10,510
king.
My fucking phone.

3782
02:48:10,510 --> 02:48:11,120
Look again.
I'm jumping off that thing,

3783
02:48:11,900 --> 02:48:16,900
but look at this.
This is my phone that I'm fucking lying 

3784
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:18,260
on my phone.
I mean we have to go to Tippi.

3785
02:48:18,261 --> 02:48:23,261
Hedren some fascinating by.
I don't think anybody should shoot 

3786
02:48:23,261 --> 02:48:23,261
lines.
I don't want to shoot a lion.

3787
02:48:23,261 --> 02:48:24,740
I don't think.
I don't think it's cool,

3788
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:28,430
but they're in the car with teeth.
They're terrifying.

3789
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:33,720
There was a beautiful article that was 
written by this woman who lived in 

3790
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:37,130
Zimbabwe right after the Cecil,
the lion thing,

3791
02:48:37,310 --> 02:48:40,460
and it said in Zimbabwe we don't cry for
lions,

3792
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:43,140
and it was explaining how they 
terrorized her village,

3793
02:48:43,141 --> 02:48:45,830
how they killed her loved ones and how 
people were.

3794
02:48:45,831 --> 02:48:50,831
When they would go out into the bush,
it would be a very real concern that 

3795
02:48:50,831 --> 02:48:52,610
they would be killed by a lion and it's 
not that the line is bad,

3796
02:48:52,850 --> 02:48:57,850
it's just that that's what lines they 
fucking do and I can't have too many of 

3797
02:48:58,071 --> 02:48:59,390
them.
You can't.

3798
02:48:59,391 --> 02:49:04,391
You can't have too many of them and the 
only way to control their population is 

3799
02:49:04,391 --> 02:49:07,301
human beings and so that thing back to 
like we are not the top of the food 

3800
02:49:07,301 --> 02:49:08,130
chain.
We're

3801
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:10,380
just not.
We're not very simple,

3802
02:49:10,410 --> 02:49:12,210
but we are,
but we are with A.

3803
02:49:12,211 --> 02:49:13,650
With a weapon.
We are a caveat.

3804
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:16,280
Yeah.
With a huge caveat with it.

3805
02:49:16,290 --> 02:49:21,290
You have to be able to first of all know
how to shoot a fight like me and that 

3806
02:49:21,290 --> 02:49:23,320
machete or Fucking Samurai sword.
I'm not the top of the food.

3807
02:49:23,321 --> 02:49:25,470
I don't know how to fucking use most of 
the weapons out there.

3808
02:49:26,810 --> 02:49:30,180
A drunk person who wasn't,
couldn't walk that good.

3809
02:49:30,181 --> 02:49:31,740
You fuck them up with that.
You know what I mean?

3810
02:49:31,790 --> 02:49:36,790
That's all.
Depending on what's the level of the 

3811
02:49:36,790 --> 02:49:38,500
threat.
Since I have no ability to even 

3812
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:39,870
understand how anxious it would make me 
to be in a room with the lion,

3813
02:49:40,050 --> 02:49:43,420
a lion is probably faster than me 
picking up a gun and shooting it.

3814
02:49:44,130 --> 02:49:49,130
I'm dead by the time I pick it up where 
you would have to first of all not just 

3815
02:49:49,130 --> 02:49:53,031
know how to shoot a gun.
You would have to have experienced 

3816
02:49:53,031 --> 02:49:54,660
shooting a gun under pressure to manage 
your anxiety and to shoot it.

3817
02:49:54,870 --> 02:49:56,540
I went to a shooting range and I was 
like cool.

3818
02:49:56,940 --> 02:50:00,660
Like I could not even.
It was like.

3819
02:50:00,700 --> 02:50:02,730
It was ridiculous.

3820
02:50:08,870 --> 02:50:10,440
I was so bad.
I was like,

3821
02:50:10,441 --> 02:50:15,441
shooting guns is really hard.
You have to be strong and you have to 

3822
02:50:15,441 --> 02:50:15,441
focus.
You have to.

3823
02:50:15,441 --> 02:50:16,950
It's a skill.
You have to learn how to do it,

3824
02:50:17,390 --> 02:50:20,120
so it's like most of us don't have that.
I mean a lot of people,

3825
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:23,970
even that skill you're shooting at a 
piece of paper that's not going to move.

3826
02:50:23,971 --> 02:50:26,970
It's not going to attack you.
This is a thing that wants to kill me.

3827
02:50:27,170 --> 02:50:29,880
Exactly.
Knows how to get around my gun,

3828
02:50:29,881 --> 02:50:31,800
but I'm going to go to an intermediate 
place,

3829
02:50:31,830 --> 02:50:36,830
go from the piece of paper that's not 
going to attack you and try to shoot a 

3830
02:50:36,830 --> 02:50:41,511
wild pig that you just.
You're gonna eat like it's nerve 

3831
02:50:41,511 --> 02:50:43,920
wracking.
It's like what they called trigger panic

3832
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:46,580
where people get on the PA or target 
panic there.

3833
02:50:46,630 --> 02:50:49,710
They're about to shoot and they can't 
keep their guns steady.

3834
02:50:49,711 --> 02:50:54,711
They can't keep their.
It's even more difficult with bow and 

3835
02:50:54,711 --> 02:50:54,711
arrow.
You can it steady.

3836
02:50:54,711 --> 02:50:56,220
It's like it's insane.
You don't know.

3837
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:58,050
You're like,
you just want to get it over with.

3838
02:50:58,260 --> 02:51:00,300
You just want to shoot it.
What was that noise?

3839
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:09,790
The few of us together when it started,
but there's this panic where you just 

3840
02:51:12,331 --> 02:51:17,331
want to get it over with.
You're so overwhelmed you can't breathe 

3841
02:51:17,331 --> 02:51:20,240
and you just want to pull the trigger in
and most people miss like the vast 

3842
02:51:20,240 --> 02:51:21,510
majority of people that sure bowhunt 
miss or rifle hunt,

3843
02:51:21,511 --> 02:51:24,630
miss.
It's a matter of controlling anxiety and

3844
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:28,910
I'm sure that exists in the navy seals 
one of their training as you know,

3845
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:33,920
they put a bag over their head and take 
it off and disorient them so that they 

3846
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:35,190
can quickly focus their eyes because 
when something's moving around,

3847
02:51:35,191 --> 02:51:37,320
it's just like it's a muscle to be asked
to,

3848
02:51:38,330 --> 02:51:39,290
you know,
well,

3849
02:51:39,340 --> 02:51:42,080
just dealing with adversity,
dealing with anxiety,

3850
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:45,690
dealing with the moment is here now 
you've been training,

3851
02:51:45,691 --> 02:51:47,700
you've been preparing,
ready crisis on.

3852
02:51:49,050 --> 02:51:54,050
You see that with fighting all the time.
There's guys that look amazing and the 

3853
02:51:54,050 --> 02:51:54,380
gym and they get to a fight and they 
can't perform.

3854
02:51:54,420 --> 02:51:57,210
You can't really simulate that 
experience.

3855
02:51:57,240 --> 02:52:02,240
Right.
There's no way in practice to really 

3856
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,801
simulate it.
Even in practice when you have like you 

3857
02:52:03,801 --> 02:52:05,990
go a lot like you have simulated fights,
there

3858
02:52:06,170 --> 02:52:09,080
would have like an audience and shoot 
his room,

3859
02:52:09,130 --> 02:52:14,130
his practices and talk a lot of shit.
Talking Shit puts a lot of pressure on 

3860
02:52:14,130 --> 02:52:14,650
you too.
That's a big thing.

3861
02:52:15,090 --> 02:52:16,870
Like guys do that.
Bowhunters do that.

3862
02:52:16,900 --> 02:52:19,120
They talk shit to each other while they 
practice.

3863
02:52:19,780 --> 02:52:22,360
It's a big thing.
They'll have competitions and during the

3864
02:52:22,361 --> 02:52:27,361
competition they're talking shit to each
other and the idea of it is you're just 

3865
02:52:27,361 --> 02:52:31,111
trying to disorient the guy and it helps
them like guys welcome it because it 

3866
02:52:31,111 --> 02:52:35,011
actually helps them concentrate on 
blocking everything out because the 

3867
02:52:35,011 --> 02:52:36,130
moment when you're actually having to 
shoot an animal,

3868
02:52:36,131 --> 02:52:40,840
so your hardest fucking take it in the 
air and you freak out.

3869
02:52:41,050 --> 02:52:44,410
So it's nothing like that for someone to
talk shit,

3870
02:52:44,411 --> 02:52:48,670
but at least it's better than you being.
Some players do that.

3871
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:49,680
I'll do that.
Yeah.

3872
02:52:49,690 --> 02:52:51,960
They like fuck with each other and you 
know,

3873
02:52:52,030 --> 02:52:52,990
try to throw each other off.

3874
02:52:52,990 --> 02:52:54,490
I guess it was probably not the same 
thing,

3875
02:52:54,491 --> 02:52:56,050
but it's more of like,
you know,

3876
02:52:56,110 --> 02:52:58,930
distract the lawyers get in their heads.
Is that called sharking?

3877
02:52:58,931 --> 02:53:01,990
That's what the.
A real a shark is not like,

3878
02:53:02,020 --> 02:53:02,530
you know,
people think,

3879
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:03,430
oh,
he's a pool shark.

3880
02:53:04,140 --> 02:53:06,250
It's not what it means in the world of 
pool players.

3881
02:53:06,490 --> 02:53:09,880
Someone is really good at pool.
You would say someone who hides it.

3882
02:53:09,881 --> 02:53:11,920
There are a hustler,
someone who doesn't hide it,

3883
02:53:11,950 --> 02:53:13,940
they're a player,
but what a shark is,

3884
02:53:13,941 --> 02:53:18,941
is actually a dishonorable thing.
A shark is someone who fucks with your 

3885
02:53:18,941 --> 02:53:20,320
head,
tries to get you to miss.

3886
02:53:20,410 --> 02:53:23,680
Like they might do things on purpose,
like drop their queue as you're shooting

3887
02:53:23,950 --> 02:53:24,860
or they might,
um,

3888
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:30,280
they might make a noise to distract you.
That's what's called sharking like,

3889
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:33,370
just to try to psych illegal.
I don't even know.

3890
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:37,420
I mean you can't get where you agree or 
not agree,

3891
02:53:37,421 --> 02:53:41,920
but some people just do it.
But in tournaments sometimes I feel like

3892
02:53:42,220 --> 02:53:47,220
right before you go on and they're like 
weird crowd when we were talking about 

3893
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:47,220
Doug Davidoff,
Mark Marin

3894
02:53:48,070 --> 02:53:50,920
or that,
or I'm the worst is when they're like,

3895
02:53:50,950 --> 02:53:53,740
great crowd.
So if you go on and do well,

3896
02:53:53,741 --> 02:53:56,380
it's not because you were good at just 
the crowd was good.

3897
02:53:56,500 --> 02:53:58,000
Well sometimes it's a good warning 
though.

3898
02:53:58,480 --> 02:54:00,110
Came off stage at the Improv the other 
night,

3899
02:54:00,111 --> 02:54:05,111
I and he was getting off stage and I was
walking in the room and he came up and 

3900
02:54:05,111 --> 02:54:05,111
gave me a hug and he goes,
dude,

3901
02:54:05,111 --> 02:54:06,260
worst fucking crowd.
Ever I'm like,

3902
02:54:06,261 --> 02:54:07,460
really?
And I was like,

3903
02:54:07,730 --> 02:54:12,730
maybe for you bitch,
and I went up there and they were 

3904
02:54:12,730 --> 02:54:12,730
fucking terrible.

3905
02:54:12,810 --> 02:54:15,950
Doing crowds are weird.
It's such a testament to our group.

3906
02:54:15,951 --> 02:54:20,951
Think for a whole crowd to unify as 
Shitty as just really warm in the room,

3907
02:54:21,441 --> 02:54:23,020
first of all,
which is always bad.

3908
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:28,170
Never read something about hot.
That makes me like what the week was 

3909
02:54:28,170 --> 02:54:29,380
Wednesday night,
Wednesday nights.

3910
02:54:29,390 --> 02:54:31,620
Weird too,
because you've got to go to work because

3911
02:54:31,640 --> 02:54:33,470
you've been there for.
It's at comegys show.

3912
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:36,090
It's fucking midnight.
No,

3913
02:54:38,630 --> 02:54:42,050
no I won't.
I will not go on past 10:00,

3914
02:54:42,080 --> 02:54:44,380
but it's good for you.
I can't.

3915
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:48,400
I cannot do it now.
I know.

3916
02:54:48,410 --> 02:54:49,670
It's just.
I know what this is.

3917
02:54:49,671 --> 02:54:50,870
Everyone's tired.
They want to go home.

3918
02:54:50,871 --> 02:54:52,280
They're looking at their check.
I'm.

3919
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:57,900
They're good.
I think those experiences are good in 

3920
02:54:57,900 --> 02:54:58,050
the beginning for eight years.
Yeah,

3921
02:54:58,070 --> 02:54:59,910
I agree with you.
Yeah,

3922
02:54:59,940 --> 02:55:04,940
like I paid the fee.
I mean I used to do standup at lucky 

3923
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:04,940
strike on

3924
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:09,580
highland and I'd have to time my jokes 
knowing a bowling ball was about to hit 

3925
02:55:09,580 --> 02:55:10,730
some pins I'd be like at.
Anyway,

3926
02:55:10,731 --> 02:55:15,731
so then he called me and then I never 
called him back like you had to time 

3927
02:55:15,731 --> 02:55:17,220
your jokes.
I did a road gig once at a restaurant in

3928
02:55:17,221 --> 02:55:22,221
Massachusetts where the inner calm that 
the restaurant use to call people's 

3929
02:55:22,221 --> 02:55:26,200
tables was the same system as the 
microphone that I used on,

3930
02:55:27,140 --> 02:55:29,210
so it'd be in the middle of talking 
about something.

3931
02:55:29,390 --> 02:55:34,080
Johnson party of your table's ready.
Fucking great.

3932
02:55:34,081 --> 02:55:35,930
It was the only time they ever did 
comedy there.

3933
02:55:36,130 --> 02:55:37,400
It was.
I was the only one.

3934
02:55:37,430 --> 02:55:39,440
It was like a one person show too.
I just went up there.

3935
02:55:39,441 --> 02:55:41,230
I was like this be.
Did you ever.

3936
02:55:41,330 --> 02:55:44,900
Do you remember Miyagi's on sunset?
Literally do.

3937
02:55:44,901 --> 02:55:46,610
It's a Sushi restaurant.
It's not there anymore.

3938
02:55:46,820 --> 02:55:47,540
You would do.

3939
02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:50,780
There was like a stage Taco now.
Exactly,

3940
02:55:51,230 --> 02:55:55,270
and there was a stage and then there was
a bridge with like a creek.

3941
02:55:56,190 --> 02:56:01,190
Yes.
Fucking fountain between you and the 

3942
02:56:01,190 --> 02:56:06,070
bridge and like a coy gardens,
like a little Chinese garden and then a 

3943
02:56:06,070 --> 02:56:08,650
bunch of people and then they always had
mtv jams on television.

3944
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:14,520
There were televisions on every wall and
people are just watching TV and then 

3945
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:19,151
you're just yelling.
I remember one time Duncan trussell got 

3946
02:56:19,151 --> 02:56:20,240
on there and we couldn't even,
we didn't even know people could hear us

3947
02:56:20,241 --> 02:56:21,320
and I was like,
I don't think anyone could even.

3948
02:56:21,330 --> 02:56:24,860
I like I did we,
are we bombing or can they hear us?

3949
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:30,400
And then done controls.
I got on stage and started basically 

3950
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:32,351
yelling the most offensive things 
imaginable and nobody responded and we 

3951
02:56:32,351 --> 02:56:32,351
realized like,
oh,

3952
02:56:32,351 --> 02:56:36,491
they just can't hear us yelling.
He was just like yelling and everyone 

3953
02:56:36,651 --> 02:56:38,210
just kept eating crazy as me.

3954
02:56:38,210 --> 02:56:42,740
August is across the street from what 
used to be Dublin's wasn't.

3955
02:56:42,741 --> 02:56:47,741
I didn't ever do that.
I remember that was like the Hashtag 

3956
02:56:48,220 --> 02:56:49,000
Dane Cook.
Yeah,

3957
02:56:49,050 --> 02:56:50,900
I got it.
I missed my thing already.

3958
02:56:50,901 --> 02:56:54,410
I mean I'm just,
I have to get my hair back to Brown.

3959
02:56:54,490 --> 02:56:57,740
Why?
Because it's for your sexy and so real.

3960
02:56:57,741 --> 02:56:58,430
Yeah,
exactly.

3961
02:56:58,850 --> 02:57:02,090
I want to distract anyone.
I don't want to become a sex symbol.

3962
02:57:02,450 --> 02:57:07,450
Uh,
I don't need that stress and that 

3963
02:57:07,450 --> 02:57:07,450
pressure.
Now I have to go back to Burnett.

3964
02:57:07,450 --> 02:57:10,730
This was sort of a just because I'm 
working on something and they just don't

3965
02:57:10,731 --> 02:57:12,120
want it to look blonde,
I guess.

3966
02:57:14,180 --> 02:57:16,080
Fuck,
I'm bleeding.

3967
02:57:16,240 --> 02:57:19,400
I'm not a blonde.
That's not my brand.

3968
02:57:19,910 --> 02:57:21,470
I did it.
Um,

3969
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:24,320
this is gonna sound weirdly 
narcissistic.

3970
02:57:24,350 --> 02:57:29,350
I for some reason what they're a little 
spurt where I was getting recognized a 

3971
02:57:29,350 --> 02:57:31,610
lot.
I was and I was touring and I was like,

3972
02:57:31,640 --> 02:57:32,870
let me just dye my hair and see what 
happens.

3973
02:57:32,871 --> 02:57:35,490
And nobody had any idea who I was.
Soon as you went blonde,

3974
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:39,050
as soon as I went blonde I was just 
completely invisible.

3975
02:57:39,230 --> 02:57:42,260
So you have a love hate relationship 
with being recognized?

3976
02:57:42,290 --> 02:57:44,840
I don't not like it.
It was literally more like,

3977
02:57:44,990 --> 02:57:46,860
let's see what like,
uh,

3978
02:57:46,890 --> 02:57:48,240
let's see.
It was like a,

3979
02:57:48,260 --> 02:57:49,780
it was like a,
it doesn't,

3980
02:57:49,850 --> 02:57:51,080
it doesn't annoy me.
It doesn't bother me.

3981
02:57:51,081 --> 02:57:56,081
I'm super grateful.
I see people that come up to me and 

3982
02:57:56,081 --> 02:57:58,241
airports as like my boss,
like they're the ones that don't say 

3983
02:57:58,241 --> 02:57:58,460
that.
The fucking guy who sent you the email.

3984
02:57:58,920 --> 02:58:00,470
That's right.
That dynamic.

3985
02:58:00,471 --> 02:58:02,580
But it's outside window probably.
He's going to hear about this.

3986
02:58:03,610 --> 02:58:04,640
No,
I think he's shooting.

3987
02:58:05,710 --> 02:58:06,930
He's an Amy Schumer van.

3988
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:14,600
He's done.
He thinks I sold out years ago when I 

3989
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:14,600
did a sec.
Um.

3990
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:16,380
Oh you did.
So I just,

3991
02:58:16,381 --> 02:58:21,381
I was like,
I was just stressing out it was causing 

3992
02:58:21,381 --> 02:58:22,440
anxiety because I never feel like I'm 
able to give people what they need and I

3993
02:58:22,441 --> 02:58:23,160
just,
you know,

3994
02:58:23,161 --> 02:58:23,730
and I was like,
I don't know,

3995
02:58:23,731 --> 02:58:25,670
I'm going to airports and I'm just like,
um,

3996
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:28,350
and I was dating somebody and I was 
getting recognized when we were on dates

3997
02:58:28,351 --> 02:58:30,020
and it would just like make things weird
and awesome.

3998
02:58:30,100 --> 02:58:31,350
Don't.
I just tried us like,

3999
02:58:31,351 --> 02:58:32,300
and I don't,
I'm not working on it.

4000
02:58:32,310 --> 02:58:33,540
Let me just change it up.

4001
02:58:35,450 --> 02:58:37,500
That's it.
And nobody fucking recognizes me.

4002
02:58:37,501 --> 02:58:38,070
And then I'm like,
hey,

4003
02:58:38,210 --> 02:58:40,020
excuse me.
I don't know if you know me,

4004
02:58:40,160 --> 02:58:43,530
like totally having this like,
hi guys.

4005
02:58:43,531 --> 02:58:45,330
I don't know if you,
do you have hbo go?

4006
02:58:45,331 --> 02:58:47,430
I just,
I'm so that.

4007
02:58:47,431 --> 02:58:52,431
It was interesting what happened when 
nobody recognized me and then I felt 

4008
02:58:52,431 --> 02:58:52,431
invisible and I was like,
oh,

4009
02:58:52,431 --> 02:58:53,590
this isn't Chicago dealer.
You know?

4010
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:56,070
It makes you realize when you get 
accustomed to stuff,

4011
02:58:56,090 --> 02:58:58,530
and so god,
how much attention do I fucking need?

4012
02:58:58,531 --> 02:59:01,050
It's so embarrassing,
and on that note,

4013
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:06,700
on that note,
I'm going to go cry in my lithium 

4014
02:59:07,111 --> 02:59:09,750
battery battery car.
This was a lot of fun.

4015
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:12,700
You're the best.
It was really good.

4016
02:59:12,880 --> 02:59:14,520
You are.
I always had the best time with you.

4017
02:59:14,521 --> 02:59:19,521
It was great time.
Three hours was so flattered when you 

4018
02:59:19,521 --> 02:59:20,100
want me to have my friend who is always 
a good time.

4019
02:59:21,500 --> 02:59:26,500
Alright fuckers.
We'll be back tomorrow with a UFC 

4020
02:59:26,500 --> 02:59:26,500
bantamweight champion.
Misha tate.

4021
02:59:26,870 --> 02:59:27,360
Paula.
