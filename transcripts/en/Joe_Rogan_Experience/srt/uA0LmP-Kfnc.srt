00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,910
Well,

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,050
I saw Ghostbusters,

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,920
I didn't see it and I like,

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,380
which I feel awful about.

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,440
There's some funny shit and Ghostbusters,

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,210
like overall it's not a good movie.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,860
This is not a good movie.

9
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,930
But they did some funny shit.

10
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,540
They,

11
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,350
they came up with some fun and
I almost want to know like,

12
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,213
man,

13
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,600
what could this have been if you let
whoever came up with all that funny shit

14
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,470
just make,

15
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,560
make a movie out of it where they
scenes where they died with the dialogue

16
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,120
scenes in dialogue.

17
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,970
There were scenes and it was
such a combination of things.

18
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:38,920
That movie and it's so had the feeling
of the hands of the producers and the

19
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:39,610
executives.

20
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,780
It's so handled that

21
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,780
you,

22
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,670
you in some ways,

23
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,190
the thing I liked about Deadpool
was I was watching it going,

24
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,030
the producers of this movie did
a good job where they were like,

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,130
this moment doesn't work.

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,860
Make it work everyday.

27
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,950
Like micromanage.

28
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:56,960
Like I worked on Chris
rock movie top five,

29
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:58,210
a little bit like for a couple of,

30
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,270
I just consulted for a couple of weeks
and the producers is guy named Scott

31
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,440
Rudin who's like a famous producer.

32
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:08,441
And what I couldn't believe was the level
of detail that guy was worried about.

33
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,171
It was,

34
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,750
he busted Chris's balls for
a year about the script,

35
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,230
literally made them rewrite and rewrite
and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and

36
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:15,920
then onset.

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,920
The guy was worried about shirts and
buttons and that's what I realized like,

38
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,441
okay,

39
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:22,450
these dead producers.

40
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,580
Whereas it feels like maybe
on Ghostbusters that got,

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,330
you got to get,

42
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,990
you have to get lucky too
with studio where they,

43
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,481
they,

44
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:31,550
you all haven't agreed to set of,

45
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,940
of what's good and then
you build the movie.

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,960
We from there was also this a problem
that the movie had a very clear agenda to

47
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:41,020
be a pro woman move.

48
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,190
Yeah.

49
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,470
Which it's gets mean.

50
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,150
There's nothing wrong
with being pro woman,

51
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,980
but if that's what,

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,090
uh,

53
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,601
it's like,

54
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:49,770
uh,

55
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,710
it's a goofy,

56
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,960
it's not a theme for a movie,

57
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:53,890
a comedy movie.

58
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:54,630
It feels

59
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,500
are buffoons.

60
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,360
They're not just buffoons there.

61
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:59,250
They're cartoonishly retarded.

62
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,610
Yeah.

63
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,630
Like Chris,

64
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:04,500
whatever the fuck name's
Thor is so retarded.

65
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,640
It doesn't even make sense.

66
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,140
Yeah,

67
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,600
he's,

68
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,860
he's so fucking stupid.

69
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,461
It doesn't make sense.

70
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,050
But they keep them around
because he's beautiful.

71
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,130
And then it's like the joke,

72
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,090
well that's a funny,

73
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:12,820
but I like it.

74
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,680
These revenge jokes where it's like,

75
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,350
so you're just going to do what men did.

76
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:18,610
How long is this going to last?

77
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,970
Like what's the next year?

78
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,670
Which is the easy for a man to say like,

79
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:21,860
Hey,

80
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,900
do something else honey.

81
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:23,680
But like,

82
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,320
but it just feels like
there's gotta be like a next,

83
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,131
uh,

84
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:27,611
next.

85
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,180
Uh,

86
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,190
there's a lot of like rep
retribution right now.

87
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,480
What Twitter is,

88
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,040
just wasn't believable.

89
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:33,831
A lot of what Twitter is,

90
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:36,400
how it's a lot of people.

91
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,360
It's like digital lynch mobs of
people and that are rightly so.

92
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,210
They'll go after people for saying
something fucked up about race.

93
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,780
Like they went up to Justin Timberlake
a few weeks ago cause he said something

94
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:47,680
more all the same.

95
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,971
And then it's like,

96
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:53,971
but you can't say that and it just
becomes this mob of people and it's purely

97
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:55,420
about racial revenge

98
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,080
as far as I'm concerned.

99
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:58,751
Well it's,

100
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:02,640
it's definitely about people
having the opportunity to shit on

101
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,690
and having people that didn't have the
opportunity to before and now they have

102
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:07,670
it via they,

103
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,510
it's like they have social cachet and
they have social power and they use it for

104
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,180
the same bullshit of
white people use it for,

105
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:15,901
well,

106
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,700
it's not even just black people doing it.

107
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,650
It's a lot of white people
are on women at any,

108
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:20,070
any,

109
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,820
any,

110
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,290
any sort of marginalized group,

111
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,980
whether it's poor,

112
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,360
any like literally any group,

113
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,030
this movie like this is,

114
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,940
there's a bunch of
problems with the movie,

115
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:30,774
but this,

116
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,540
the,

117
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:31,900
the,

118
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,800
the fact that all the men in
the movie were ridiculous.

119
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,430
All the men this movie were
buffoons all the men in the movie.

120
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,760
Like they like Bill Murray
gets fucking killed in it.

121
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:42,594
Spoiler alert.

122
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:42,960
Yeah.

123
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,780
I mean it's weird.

124
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,741
It's weird.

125
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:47,160
It's like,

126
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,490
yeah,

127
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,790
it's an agenda driven movie more
than they'd wrote something.

128
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,201
They figured,

129
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:51,331
well,

130
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:51,600
they'll,

131
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,210
it'll work if you do this or
if it'll work if you do that.

132
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,540
Like they didn't even have
romantic interests in the
movie because men were just

133
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,930
so retarded.

134
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,780
Like the women didn't have boyfriends,

135
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:05,130
they didn't have husbands.

136
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:07,560
They didn't have like
they had Chris Hemsworth.

137
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,040
Yeah.

138
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,760
But that's it.

139
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,050
And he was just eye candy.

140
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,261
Well,

141
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:10,900
the thing

142
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,660
tell people is when you're
writing about a specific gen,

143
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,980
like for a long time,

144
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,300
women in comedy,

145
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,700
women in comedy movies were
a props or they were like,

146
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:25,520
Andie MacDowell always used to be
like the love interest and in Dallas,

147
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,500
uh,

148
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,400
and she was always just like this warm
sort of like vaguely disapproving.

149
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,960
It's either like you're disapproving of
the guy or you're approving to a fault

150
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,221
because that's,

151
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:36,701
if you're,

152
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,860
if there's a movie about a certain,

153
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,120
uh,

154
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,691
gender,

155
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:40,981
which is,

156
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,100
it was usually men,

157
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,740
the women in their lives
for the plot to advance,

158
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,770
they'd even have to be for
the plot or against the plot.

159
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,250
Right.

160
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,650
So then women started complaining like,

161
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:51,010
well,

162
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,450
you see us as these binary goofy things
and obviously women in life are more

163
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:56,260
complex than that.

164
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,070
So to now that women are starting to get
their own movies and it's about groups

165
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:00,904
of women,

166
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,170
you see it,

167
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,640
it's a writing problem.

168
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,331
It's,

169
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:09,331
you're in a trap where the men and
bridesmaids were goofy as fuck.

170
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,230
It was an Irish cop in Milwaukee.

171
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,250
Tell me more.

172
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,250
Cause I've never seen that
my fucking whole life.

173
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,720
A guy who's just like,

174
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,660
and bridesmaids is a fucking
masterpiece for the most part.

175
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,591
Just that part.

176
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,101
I was kind of like,

177
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:21,281
wait,

178
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:24,100
so he's a cop and he's got an endless,

179
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,690
uh,

180
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,380
appetite for wig even though
she's not interested in,

181
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:29,880
was a,

182
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,940
and was Dicky to him.

183
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:31,541
But he's still,

184
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,291
he'll take her back,

185
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,000
whatever.

186
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,280
Uh,

187
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,630
and it becomes about,

188
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:38,680
he's basically the only man in the movie
and it's kind of a goofy part and it's,

189
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,901
well,

190
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:43,901
it's because it's about a group of women
and that's just the purpose that men

191
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:45,130
have in that plot.

192
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,181
You know what I mean?

193
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:46,590
But,

194
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,620
but they always date people take
it as like this a sexism thing.

195
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,360
And I just take it as like
a screenwriting thing.

196
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:52,761
Well,

197
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:53,780
it is that definitely,

198
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:57,950
but one of the problems that people have
found when they're talking this movie

199
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,920
is that you can't criticize it
because if you criticize it,

200
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,754
you're sexist.

201
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,510
Yeah.

202
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,141
And no,

203
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,590
it's not.

204
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,120
It's not a good piece of art.

205
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,183
Yeah.

206
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,700
It's not really well done.

207
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,130
But there's moments who did,

208
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,810
who did bridesmaids
that I'm talking about?

209
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,650
The same guy,

210
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,790
same guy who did it,

211
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,420
he's dead.

212
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,631
Well,

213
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:14,931
whatever.

214
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:15,741
He's done it twice now.

215
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,370
But like,

216
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,920
I think he knows he's
a really good writer.

217
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,870
Like he knows you can you,

218
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,690
it's hard to write
because it's never been,

219
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:23,911
I,

220
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:24,591
I always tell people,

221
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:24,771
listen,

222
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:27,440
I go show me a good example of a,

223
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,550
a movie about a group of guys where
the woman isn't just even in Deadpool,

224
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,810
she's a prop to the,

225
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,620
but they made fun of it or she's
in love with him unconditionally,

226
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,780
even though his face turns into a monster
and she still wants him to eat a pussy

227
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,010
and they make fun of it.

228
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,281
Yeah.

229
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:44,840
They make fun of it in a funny way.

230
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:48,620
Like their meetup there meet cute and
then they think about how Gammage they

231
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:48,961
both are.

232
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:51,830
That was like perfect to me
cause it was brief and it uh,

233
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,360
it's like the thing they always complain
about when you're developing movies,

234
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,710
like I don't buy this couple.

235
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,331
It's like yeah,

236
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:58,190
it's fucking movie.

237
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,700
Right.

238
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,500
Sorry.

239
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,140
Just not,

240
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,520
I don't buy a lot of real couples.

241
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,241
Well not only that,

242
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:04,010
they have to spell it
all out in two hours.

243
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,521
Yeah.

244
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:07,040
And they have to meet and fall
in love with in five minutes.

245
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,260
Well there's a lot more
to relationships in that.

246
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:09,491
Yeah.

247
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:09,621
Yeah.

248
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,000
We can't show you all that other shit.

249
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,390
Yeah.

250
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,500
Cause that takes hours,

251
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,170
days and weeks and months and you fuck,

252
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,243
that is correct.

253
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,930
The sad thing about the movie,

254
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,260
the Ghostbusters movie is there's some
stuff in it that was really clever.

255
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,420
There was funny stuff and I,

256
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,670
in the beginning I was
enjoying it and I was like,

257
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:26,121
you know what,

258
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:29,060
I bet people are not given
this thing a fair shake.

259
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,400
And then as it got on and I was like,

260
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,641
oh,

261
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:32,300
they just,

262
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,100
this is just so clunky.

263
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,040
There's parts of it that were
just so clumsy and just poorly,

264
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,170
poorly got to see it because every single
one of those women are fucking home

265
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,004
run hitters.

266
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,790
Yeah.

267
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,500
Melissa McCarthy is fucking funny,

268
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:45,920
man.

269
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,551
The Dude,

270
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,820
she's fucking funny wig Kristen wig.

271
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,541
Which one?

272
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,080
She,

273
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,610
uh,

274
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,510
she was in bridesmaids.

275
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,140
I don't know.

276
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,530
I don't know what she's
the Auburn haired woman.

277
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,670
Yeah.

278
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,620
This is Flatley's it fucking monster.

279
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,010
She's,

280
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,570
she's handicapped in it.

281
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,990
They'd give her some clunky lines.

282
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:06,860
Uh,

283
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,693
and then,

284
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,630
uh,

285
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,650
the girl from SNL,

286
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,790
Kate Mckinnon is really,

287
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,001
really,

288
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,000
she was really fun in it.

289
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,490
She was very funny in it.

290
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,010
It's not that bad.

291
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,341
I mean,

292
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,001
I didn't hate it.

293
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,020
I went to see what my kids,

294
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,093
they enjoyed it.

295
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,330
But um,

296
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,380
there was,

297
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,330
there were some moments
I laughed pretty hard.

298
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,990
Great.

299
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,730
But most of it not.

300
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:26,900
Yeah.

301
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,220
It's hard to make funny movies,

302
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:28,580
man.

303
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,121
And you know,

304
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:29,990
it's like at the end,

305
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:30,980
they way they wrap it up,

306
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:31,310
you're like,

307
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,480
oh Christ,

308
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,970
I can't the fuck outta here.

309
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:35,361
It's like,

310
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,710
it's so clumsy.

311
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,430
Oh,

312
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,450
it's just so awkward.

313
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,880
If somebody told me there
were no stakes in the movie,

314
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,691
it was just like,

315
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:41,901
yeah,

316
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,280
there's ghosts and we're
going to find them.

317
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,643
We got them.

318
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,730
Yeah.

319
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,563
Yeah.

320
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,523
It is weird.

321
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,140
It's hot fucking mean.

322
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,220
It's funny.

323
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:52,941
Good movies.

324
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:53,774
Really hard.

325
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,530
Yeah.

326
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,170
Budget movie.

327
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,640
A big budget with a legacy
and a start and a end.

328
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:00,474
A release date.

329
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:00,961
Yeah.

330
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:01,630
And if they just see,

331
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,780
if there was no Ghostbusters before it,

332
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,460
there'd never been a ghostbuster movie.

333
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,290
And this was the first
ever ghostbuster movie.

334
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,950
There would not,

335
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,600
we wouldn't be talking
about price busters.

336
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,493
It would be different.

337
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,030
Yeah.

338
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,290
Well,

339
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,270
it may be people would enjoy it more and
maybe they wouldn't be so handicapped

340
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:19,920
because they had to sort of connect with
the legacy and tie all these loose ends

341
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,763
in and they can,

342
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,870
they kind of do it any way,

343
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,733
any way they want.

344
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:32,860
Okay.
