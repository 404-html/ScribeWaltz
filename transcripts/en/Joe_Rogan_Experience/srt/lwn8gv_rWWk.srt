1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,010
Day One of legal marijuana.
Bert Kreischer.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,990
It doesn't feel any different.
Does it feel less naughty?

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,290
Uh,
no.

4
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,124
I'm just worried that they're going to 
clog up the dispensary's the people 

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:12,921
will.
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:15,770
Because now you have to use the wait in 
the waiting room sometimes.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,770
Now that it's going to be legal.
I don't know how they're like one in one

8
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:20,390
out thing.
It's gonna be a fucking nightmare.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,710
Are they allowed to just open up down 
the general public?

10
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:23,544
Is that how it works?
I was just looking right before we 

11
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:25,554
started.
I think they have until 2018 to start 

12
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:29,650
issuing licenses and 2018.
They can't.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,700
The current dispensary's can only sell 
to their current patients.

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,710
Like they can't sell the people walking 
in off the street.

15
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:36,390
They're going to change some rules.
Oh.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,393
Oh.
But 2018 before they start giving out 

17
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,930
licenses haven't tilled that long.
They don't push it until that long.

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,853
Oh,
if they wanted to hold back and dig 

19
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,230
their heels in.
Huh?

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,580
Interesting.
So we have at the very most,

21
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,180
a year before it just get,
becomes like Colorado,

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,120
which is Carla was goddamn while I'm 
circling.

23
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:56,954
It happened in Colorado too.
It took him about a year before they 

24
00:00:58,201 --> 00:00:59,760
figured everything out.
Have you,

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,760
uh,
have you been down and gone down to like

26
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,590
the areas of Colorado where they're 
selling pot now?

27
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah,
I went with you right?

28
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,770
Because you did,
you,

29
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,703
we didn't go down to the store.
I went to a couple stores on my own 

30
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:11,641
without you,
I guess.

31
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:12,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,233
I haven't,
I've driven by them but I haven't gone 

33
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:18,690
in and checked them out.
But that's what's going to happen here.

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,570
It's going to be crazy and it's going to
be better for everybody.

35
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,120
It's going to be better for the economy.
It's going to be better for people.

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,190
My wife doesn't,
doesn't smoke weed at all and voted yes.

37
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,890
I'm good.
Good.

38
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,450
Good.
Yeah,

39
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:28,740
yeah,
yeah,

40
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,573
yeah,
yeah.

41
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,311
Um,
she,

42
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,400
uh,
she voted for um,

43
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,080
us to prop 70,
64.

44
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,750
That might've been my favorite night 
moment of the whole night last night.

45
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,440
It was pretty awesome by the way,
that I give 100 percent credit to Jamie.

46
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,540
That was like you gave me an ace in the 
hole.

47
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,760
I was sitting off the side.
I don't even have a mic at time.

48
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:49,210
I don't think Jamie just goes breaking 
news and hands me his phone.

49
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,210
I wasn't even reading it up the phone,
but I grabbed the mic and I go,

50
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:53,044
guys,
I have breaking news prop 64 has been 

51
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,180
legally been passed in California.
The place went nuts.

52
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,820
Joe Lights at joint.
I rip my shirt off.

53
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:01,654
Started slapping the stage bill birds 
high past that joint like he had indeed 

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,320
passed to a couple of times.
He was like,

55
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:12,820
I'm good.
I don't smoke pot.

56
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,190
I'm a whiskey guy,
and then he was like,

57
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:18,040
fuck.
It took a legit hit.

58
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,900
Yeah,
he was stoned too.

59
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,890
That was wrong.
With that said,

60
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,270
let me

61
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,050
speed.
We'd shit.

62
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,240
I don't know what strain he's got,
but good.

63
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,270
Jesus Lord.
Oh mercy was such a beautiful night.

64
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,370
That was probably the most fun I've ever
had on a podcast.

65
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,204
I keep.
I've said that before because I had 

66
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:36,740
some.
I've had,

67
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,710
we've had some fun ones together.
Oh Yeah,

68
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,743
but dad might have topped it off.
I don't think I've ever laughed any 

69
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:42,914
harder.
Like borough had me laughing harder 

70
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,374
than.
I mean it's just as hard as you can 

71
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,320
laugh.
It was so fun.

72
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:49,770
Everything was fun.
Yeah.

73
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,893
The bar me,
you have me with that line because you 

74
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,280
guys see that picture of trump looking 
at his wife voting and you were like,

75
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,560
what did you say?
I said,

76
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,960
that's the look I give my dog when he 
gets too close to my cat.

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,020
Hey motherfucker,
leave her alone.

78
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,370
That whole show was so quick.
It was so.

79
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,773
It was literally like a,
like they were doing double Dutch with 

80
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:17,800
comedy and you had to know when to jump 
in and went and I'm going to hop out and

81
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,750
I said this to you this morning or this 
afternoon.

82
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,063
That first 133 minutes was not that much
talking over each other when something 

83
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,990
happened that I wasn't aware of,
but people started to show it up.

84
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,960
They weren't invited and sat down.
I didn't know.

85
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,800
We're just sort of sorting that out now,
like there's microphones that were there

86
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,703
and you know,
there was people that we had asked to 

87
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:39,244
come that we're kind of waiting to get 
on and then other people that just sort 

88
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,430
of walked in and got on.

89
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,280
I don't think it was clear to them.
I don't know how it was set up,

90
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,270
I don't know,
but it's chaotic when you have more than

91
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,170
two people just to people's hearts 
sometimes to manage conversations,

92
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,183
but then you get three and four and then
you play it in front of a live audience 

93
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,900
and then people just coming in and 
jumping in.

94
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,910
So there was a couple of issues.
I guess.

95
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,550
I wasn't paying too much attention and 
we were too drunk.

96
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,380
We were gone.
You bailed out when,

97
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,240
uh,
when you went into the set.

98
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,920
Well,
when I went and do a set,

99
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,620
that's apparently what.
And Sarah Tiana went at it.

100
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,940
I missed all the goodness.

101
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,180
All I'll tell you is that I've been 
doing comedy 17 years.

102
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:20,014
I am well aware that bill burrs practice
of comedy is to assemble brilliantly 

103
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:27,160
laid arguments that you wouldn't 
normally agree with.

104
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,683
To go head to head with them in a debate
about porn would not be something I 

105
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,760
think would be wise of anyone.
What was her,

106
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,820
her position was,
this is when I was leaving,

107
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,670
her position was that people watch too 
much porn.

108
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,720
Then men like pouring too much.
Right?

109
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:42,390
Yeah.
And,

110
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,480
and it was about the condoms and for 
moving to a different place and,

111
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,143
and then it turned into the middle 
crossover states are just racists and 

112
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,170
just broad stroking kind of.
It was what bill was doing,

113
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,120
I think.
I Dunno,

114
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,900
I was pretty fucked up at this time,
but he was,

115
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,600
he was disassembling what is this 
elitist liberal movement,

116
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,420
which is,
if you don't agree with me,

117
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:09,700
you're a racist rape apologist,
sexist,

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,910
and bill just was saying that's not it.

119
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,460
Some people want change,
you know?

120
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,470
Yeah,
yeah.

121
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,393
That,
that is a real sweeping brush that 

122
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,940
people from both sides like to use.
Right?

123
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,220
The people and the right to use it on 
the liberals,

124
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,180
the liberals like conservatives,
unconservative,

125
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,330
we like to paint people like real 
obvious,

126
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,140
put,
you know,

127
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,720
put them in a box,
make sure we can categorize them.

128
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,120
Yeah.
So I mean,

129
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,140
I said,
I said,

130
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,280
well,
I think I got,

131
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,203
I think I might have accidentally 
started a little bit of it because it 

132
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,893
looked,
all you have to realize is there's just 

133
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:41,704
a disenfranchised part of America that 
feels like they're not being 

134
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:44,704
represented.
And then immediately I think Sarah got 

135
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,220
jumped on me and she was like,
Oh,

136
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,140
you're talking about the racists.
And I was like,

137
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,120
I don't know.
You can't say that.

138
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,460
You can't say that I voted for him by 
the way.

139
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,380
I voted for Hillary.
So I'm just saying,

140
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,100
Ha,
what I'm noticing.

141
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,380
I have an election.
So I.

142
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,920
But I,
you know,

143
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,810
I thought it was good of her to stand 
her ground and,

144
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,310
and to hold into say her point and not 
trying to backpedal and,

145
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,760
and I appreciate it

146
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,623
that.
But,

147
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,613
well,
you know,

148
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,040
the problem is the problem with that 
saying that anybody that voted for trump

149
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:13,880
is a racist.
The real,

150
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,733
the real problem with that is because 
the only other alternative is Hillary 

151
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,390
and Hillary was very flawed.
That's just the way it is.

152
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,290
You know,
it's not,

153
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,363
it's not an anti woman thing to think 
that someone who has all the ties to 

154
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,674
corruption that she apparently does mean
you can go into it all day long if you 

155
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,334
want to,
if you want to like look at the Clinton 

156
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,333
Foundation or any of the other crazy 
shit that those people were involved 

157
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:37,430
with.
It's kind of legal,

158
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,323
you know what I mean?
Not really breaking any laws so you can 

159
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,700
get away with doing all that stuff.
But all of it is learning,

160
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,240
deleted emails and all that.
Like what are you doing?

161
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,950
Like what is this you?

162
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,383
And I think,
I think there was a large portion of 

163
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,114
America who just didn't want to show 
their opinion because they didn't want 

164
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:55,610
to be called a name

165
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,870
[inaudible].
And there's,

166
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,670
there's real concerns too.
And people don't want to say this.

167
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,130
There's real concerns about her health.
Really.

168
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,950
She hurt her head in 2012 because she 
blacked out.

169
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,960
She,
she blacked out,

170
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,460
fell,
fainted,

171
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,280
and hit her head really bad,
like really bad.

172
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,773
And um,
apparently she was fucked up for like 

173
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:18,810
six months and this was 2012.
That's only four years ago,

174
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:19,644
man.
And that's a really significant head 

175
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:25,260
trauma.
And she was very eloquent into debates.

176
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,094
She's really articulate.
I thought she kicked his ass and the 

177
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:28,680
debates.
I honestly did.

178
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,950
I thought she came off smoother,
especially that second one.

179
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,290
Like he would say some crazy shit and 
she would smile.

180
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,663
I thought she handled it great and she 
was so much more eloquent and so much 

181
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,690
like,
so much more.

182
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,040
So much better economy of words.
The problem is,

183
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:48,041
is just,
it's so hard to trust that she's telling

184
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:49,044
you the truth.

185
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,183
You know,
there's just too many things that she's 

186
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:53,070
been like the difference between that 
Komi Guy,

187
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,430
what he said she had done with her email
and what she said she had done,

188
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,500
and you play them back and forth.
You ever seen the video?

189
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,660
They do that.
It's pretty shocking,

190
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,620
you know what he says is very different 
than heard descriptions of what he says.

191
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,903
What he says is she violated some laws 
and what most people thought in the 

192
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,883
apparently in the FBI.
It's one of the things that people got 

193
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,700
upset at Komi.
Apparently from this article I read,

194
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:18,090
at least they were saying that the 
people in the FBI were very disappointed

195
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:20,010
because they thought that he should have
pressed charges.

196
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,133
They thought that when they looked at 
all the evidence and all the stuff that 

197
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:25,884
he talked about,
that he admitted that she had done that 

198
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:27,984
you can't do with classified data.
She had violated all these laws like if 

199
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:31,824
you were a regular person,
if you are really regular enlisted 

200
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:36,570
person and you violated those same 
amount of loss,

201
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:37,590
dude,
you'd be fucked.

202
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,160
You will be fucked.
Phil really puts you in a Goddamn cage.

203
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:41,870
One hundred percent.

204
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,490
Look,
I know this sounds silly,

205
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,140
but she just like,
they said,

206
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:45,974
hey,
we'd like to see your emails.

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,600
She just got rid of them all.
She deleted them all.

208
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:52,710
She deleted 30,000
emails and she did it after a subpoena.

209
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,040
At least some of them after,
so I didn't.

210
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,913
What was after the subpoena?
See how many find out how many emails 

211
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:02,500
she deleted after the subpoena.
I don't know,

212
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,340
you know,
the absolute specifics of it,

213
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,174
but it's just,
it's my point is it wasn't like she was 

214
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,340
this awesome alternative,
you know,

215
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:12,174
so people that want to change and they 
felt like what Hillary represented is a 

216
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,970
part of that big system as well as she 
says her words and is a stately.

217
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:21,804
She is and she's a much better 
representative of America in some ways 

218
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:29,730
than he is,
but she's just too tied to corruption.

219
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,690
Like all of the stuff that she's done,
like all the,

220
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:33,524
the experience she has in government,
all that should be on her favorite in 

221
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,344
her favor.

222
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,420
But for a lot of people it wasn't this 
time.

223
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,703
For a lot of people that are like,
this government is just too intertwined 

224
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,154
with these businesses that support it 
and pay it money and they're going to 

225
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,174
all these different foreign countries 
and getting paid exorbitant sums of 

226
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,164
money to talk.
It's like Bill Clinton was getting like 

227
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,450
half a million dollars to fly to these 
countries that are all these like really

228
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,503
serious,
like civil rights violations on their 

229
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:04,560
people.
Yeah.

230
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,660
There was like something that Clinton 
had done.

231
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,520
We kept trying to push this one through,
see if he could find that there was this

232
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:15,660
one like dictatorship that he wanted to 
go into.

233
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,030
He wanted to go and do speeches and they
were like,

234
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:18,960
no,
you can't go.

235
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,570
They're like,
you're not supposed to visit that place.

236
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:24,930
These people are doing things we don't 
we don't agree with.

237
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,541
And he's like,
yeah,

238
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,374
yeah,
I got to go over there and I'm going to 

239
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,980
do the speech,
so let's just try to get.

240
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,630
Like,
he just wanted to do that speech.

241
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,920
He just wanted that Cheddar.

242
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:33,963
That's.
I think it's what's interesting to me 

243
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:41,080
now is as the population on twitter,
at least of people,

244
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:46,081
my friends that voted for hilary that 
are now just saying,

245
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,820
fuck,
fuck the rest of the country.

246
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,560
Fuck,
I'm out.

247
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,750
This sucks.
It's like you like,

248
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,280
did you see that?
The Canadian website,

249
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,700
the immigration website broke.
It crashed,

250
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,330
broke.
All the Americans were like,

251
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:01,310
fuck this,
I'm moving to Canada.

252
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,900
Has anyone ever done that though?
Fuck yeah.

253
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,360
You think fuck yeah.
Especially Vancouver.

254
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,080
Oh yeah.
Warm like Seattle.

255
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,610
It's basically just in Seattle,
but I mean like weather wise is similar.

256
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,020
Yeah.
So it was probably identical,

257
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:21,070
but there was something different about 
Vancouver that Seattle doesn't have.

258
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,830
What's that like?
I almost like this.

259
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,580
I'm like colonial,
like richness,

260
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:29,500
this European richness that,
you know,

261
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:32,260
that bridge driving into Vancouver with 
couple of big lions and.

262
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,131
Yeah.
And you're like,

263
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,820
oh,
this just looks like Lord of the Rings.

264
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,470
He like,
it looks like it could be in Germany and

265
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:41,440
that everything's a little more lush or 
a little more overgrown.

266
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,260
I don't know if Seattle see,
I like saddle love Seattle,

267
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:45,094
but the downtown's look similar,
but even still like the downtown 

268
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,253
Vancouver,
the food's always seems just a little 

269
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:50,920
bit better than Seattle.
Did you ever do?

270
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,960
Man?
That's a tough call.

271
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,430
They're both pretty fucking awesome.

272
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,560
You can't have shitty food.
And the Pacific northwest.

273
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,470
Yeah.
You know,

274
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,500
like Oregon,
Portland,

275
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,630
Portland's another place.
They have some fucking bang.

276
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,903
Do you ever go to that?
You ever do a go to that little TACO 

277
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,280
truck circle that?

278
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,193
Yes.
Yes.

279
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,690
Do they have a tie?
Cheeseburger?

280
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,810
It's a cheeseburger with that leg.
Satay sauce.

281
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:17,510
That peanut butter sauce.
Holy Shit.

282
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,493
And it's super spicy.
It's got Serratia and it fucking love 

283
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:21,981
God.
Damn.

284
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:25,130
It's good.
Bill Clinton sought State Department.

285
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,150
Okay.
For paid speeches related to North Korea

286
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,680
and the Congo.

287
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,870
Why don't you?
He's an animal.

288
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,050
They're cutting kids' hands off and the 
Congo.

289
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,300
I respect his game.
I respect his game.

290
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:42,134
He's like,
there's a lot of paper for me over 

291
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,960
there.
I guarantee get it.

292
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,700
I guarantee you when he.
When she got elected,

293
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:47,391
he was like,
fuck.

294
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,070
I guess she'll be around the house a lot
more.

295
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,110
Look at this.
It says the FBI about the deleted emails

296
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:58,490
between March 25th and March 31st three 
weeks after the subpoena.

297
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,073
The campaign now says it only learned 
when the emails were deleted from the 

298
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:09,020
FBI report.
Wow.

299
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,000
How many emails?
Oh my God.

300
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,730
Thirty thousand 490 work related emails 
on December fifth,

301
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:21,350
2014 and chose not to keep 31,830
emails.

302
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,550
She deemed personal.

303
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,040
Well that's interesting.
By the way,

304
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,490
do you know how difficult that would be?
I have 33 unopened emails.

305
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,790
Thirty 3000 on the opened emails on my 
thing and sometimes I try.

306
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,840
It's just like spam and I try to clean 
it out and it's a fucking nightmare.

307
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,040
Yeah.
It's not an easy to clean.

308
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,230
You're like select all delete.
But then you still.

309
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,020
It only takes one to like 800.
Yeah.

310
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,630
Don't take fucking forever.
It would take forever.

311
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,700
What were you saying last night about a.
were you saying like if they fuck,

312
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,150
if they went through our emails,
what animals would look like?

313
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,710
I don't remember what I said I did.
Were blasted.

314
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:02,610
We were talking about they went,
they went through all her emails.

315
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,640
I can do like they.
Because they went through the or the FBI

316
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,050
went through a bunch of emails.
Deleted emails,

317
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:10,884
right?
Yeah.

318
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,850
And I thought it was used.
I thought you said it last night.

319
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:14,684
I don't know,
but I was thinking I used to do this 

320
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:20,040
test on my emails to find out like if 
someone went into my emails,

321
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,610
how bad I look.
I use it.

322
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,520
It was cigarette,
right?

323
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:26,670
You just go into the search and then 
type in keywords like type in the n word

324
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,900
and see if it's ever been typed in my 
email,

325
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,400
type in the word faggot and see if they 
like have done that.

326
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,850
Also the problem is we,
especially as Comedians,

327
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,360
we fuck with each other and emails.
We talk mad shit to each other.

328
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,010
I mean that's one of the funniest shows 
in Hollywood is that roast battle,

329
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,860
right?
Like comedians enjoy.

330
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:48,780
Like I enjoy it when someone lights me 
up.

331
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,643
It's funny.
Like Barilla last night said I had a 

332
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,460
little rascals hat on.

333
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,443
Jose,
you're over there with a fucking little 

334
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,280
rascals hat on.
Oh,

335
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,850
we'd like shitting on each other.
It's fun.

336
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,740
Yeah.

337
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,940
We like to say that we fucked each 
other's moms.

338
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,133
It's funny.
It's funny that rose petals fucking 

339
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,430
brutal.
Brutal.

340
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,353
It's brutal.
But like we'll say shit to each other 

341
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,640
all the time,
like Ari and I do that all the time.

342
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,220
He'll say something like,
yeah,

343
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,350
I will.
I was fucking your mom all day,

344
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:24,350
dude.
I got tired just just out of nowhere.

345
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,120
Like wow.
My mom.

346
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,560
What was she like?
Salty.

347
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,930
Oh dude,
that's it.

348
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,710
I just was texting back and forth with 
red other day.

349
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,183
Ours is a savage.
He just filmed his special and Austin 

350
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,760
say we super happy speaking a 
specialist.

351
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:44,940
Bert Kreischer Friday night the machine

352
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,200
September or November?
November.

353
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:48,963
Back in time.
Motherfuckers November 11th on showtime 

354
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,750
at 10 PM.
The machine.

355
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,330
Yeah.
Fuck yeah,

356
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,383
that looks fun.
Dude is telling him that the Irvine 

357
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:58,150
Improv.
I.

358
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,860
Oh shit.
We uh,

359
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,810
I tell I went back with you.
Ari.

360
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:03,490
Joey.
I'm Tom.

361
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:04,324
I texted everyone because everyone's 
been doing specials and I've been on 

362
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,500
travel channel for seven years.
So I was like,

363
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,000
hey,
what insights and you and I,

364
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,570
the consensus everyone had was like,
I'm not,

365
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:15,520
I don't do theaters the fuck am I doing 
in a theater.

366
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,530
So I'm going to do it in a club.
That's where I do.

367
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,641
And I,
the other thing,

368
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:19,421
I was like,
I was like,

369
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:21,520
I've been doing standup shirtless for 
seven years.

370
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,190
I'm fucking doing it shirtless.
Which before was before that,

371
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,360
like that.
Why do you like just throwing that shirt

372
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:30,420
off just makes you free?
I'm a terrible.

373
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,273
I'm a Florida kid.
Last night I was in jeans and flip 

374
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:37,100
flops.
And were you wearing flip flops?

375
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:39,150
So like he's got flip flops on.
Yeah,

376
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,740
that I didn't shirtless.
And then.

377
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,963
And then Tom and I got in that fat 
shaming battle and you people get so 

378
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:47,884
mad.

379
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,483
So mad about that.
I saw people being mean to tom be mean 

380
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,390
to you.
Wow.

381
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,224
Folks.
You don't see that they're fucking 

382
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:55,270
around.

383
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,103
Oh,
the worst was like when it was pulling 

384
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:58,714
it,
like there was my wife's friend passed 

385
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:04,150
away and I left a comment on her,
on her,

386
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:04,984
uh,
on her picture of her and her mom is 

387
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,080
like four in the morning when I saw it 
and was like,

388
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:09,700
Hey,
so sorry for your loss.

389
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:10,534
We'll see you today.
And then I guess someone saw me post on 

390
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:15,310
there and one of the gop,
one of Tom's friends.

391
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,960
And they wrote,
sorry if your lost,

392
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:21,961
did burt sit on your mom?
And I was immediately,

393
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,110
tom finds that fucking hilarious,
but this lady is like hey.

394
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,370
And then it was just like,
yeah,

395
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,680
birch fat as fuck like this.
They just fill it up.

396
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,710
And she was like that your friends are 
your fans are dicks.

397
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:33,880
I was like,
those aren't my fans,

398
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:35,230
I don't think.
But uh,

399
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,360
so we did the fat shaming battle and 
then Tom,

400
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,660
Tom,
the thing from my specialty,

401
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,523
like

402
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,120
you did these shirtless,
this is going to get bad birds.

403
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,173
Him and Christina just did a big 
preamble on the beginning of their 

404
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,520
podcast about me shirtless.

405
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,720
Yeah.
You did it last night somewhere early.

406
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,110
Yeah.
I like you.

407
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:58,830
As soon as it comes off I feel free.
I know I can tell.

408
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,431
I'm like,
wow,

409
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:00,264
that's interesting because it's almost 
like a psychological button that you 

410
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,470
have to take that shirt off and you're 
like,

411
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:06,750
yes.
Freedom.

412
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,370
It's like,
it makes you tingle.

413
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

414
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,310
It's,
it's my long hair.

415
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,203
My Thor Sampson's long hair.
I did it in a meeting one time cause I 

416
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,450
was like,
I get,

417
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,500
I get,
I get meetings and I'll get like,

418
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,521
Pitt,
sweaty,

419
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:22,290
you know,
and then you can see it in the shirt and

420
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,750
nothing looks worse than that.
So you just take your shirt off.

421
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,980
Just walked in,
took my fucking shirt.

422
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,180
Oh my God.

423
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,700
Oh Wow.
That's a lyric.

424
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:33,810
Yeah.
Why not man?

425
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:36,300
Why does it a big deal?
Why is it the whole thing?

426
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,400
The thing that I'm stuck with,
standup is like,

427
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,353
especially during my next hour is like 
we get caught up into these and I was 

428
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:43,104
talking to Justin Brooke about this.
We get caught up in these mechanisms of 

429
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,550
this is what we have to do.
There was a period where every comic has

430
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,384
to have a sweatshirt.
I'm new balance sneakers and a Hoodie 

431
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,000
and you know,
everyone did the same thing and then you

432
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:54,834
see someone like Judah friedlander doing
something totally different and you're 

433
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:57,661
like,
oh fuck,

434
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,100
that really separates itself from the 
pack.

435
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,290
But you are my only.
My only problem is,

436
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,630
and I've talked to have thought about 
this and I've talked to you about it,

437
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,560
is I don't wanna have to do stand up 
every time in my fucking shirt off.

438
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,423
Like I don't.
Like I don't need to have my shirt off 

439
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:14,370
to do stand up.
I like to have it off.

440
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,020
What was the last time you did a site 
with it on?

441
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,780
Anytime I'm at the store.
Oh yeah.

442
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,860
Hmm.
How come?

443
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,300
I don't know.
I don't,

444
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,020
I feel like it's,
I feel like it's disrespectful and weird

445
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:30,021
way like because it's not your show,
just like 15 minutes.

446
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,223
That's 15 minutes setting too R and I 
and I have done it by the way I have 

447
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:35,454
done it,
but for the most part I don't because 

448
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:37,771
I'm like,
you know,

449
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:38,604
I'm only doing 15 minutes.
I'm really there to work on material to 

450
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:43,050
see if it works.
There'll be like Chris rock going up and

451
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,303
doing like his inflections,
like I need to see if this works and it 

452
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,950
and that our man's a fucking beast.
Like there's no other place,

453
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,960
a better place in the world to find out 
if something works.

454
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,950
Yeah,
it's a gym.

455
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,100
It's also like people have seen a lot of
goddamn comedy,

456
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,930
you know,
it's a lot.

457
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,820
I mean it's,
it's beautiful.

458
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,313
It's the best spot ever.
I mean that that room has got more 

459
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,820
history in it than any room in the 
country.

460
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,430
So you feel it?
Oh yeah.

461
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,353
And it's.
And it's,

462
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,140
for some reason it just doesn't.
Whatever the Mojo in there is,

463
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,063
you take a bit that would kill on the 
road and you're bringing them there and 

464
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,840
they,
they find its flaws.

465
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,943
They find the lazy writing.
They find the overcompensation with 

466
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:25,750
inflection or energy.
And like I,

467
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,520
I took two bits in there and I worked 
them out like last call.

468
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,490
It was probably a month ago.
Worked them out three nights,

469
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,850
then come to them on the road and they 
just were so much better.

470
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,730
I was like wow.
And the stories too.

471
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,680
So like the other thing about the is it 
doesn't necessarily lend itself great to

472
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,523
storytelling.
It's more of like a punch and Jab fuck 

473
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:50,020
with the audience dancing type of thing,
but like they're there two.

474
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,590
I went up there and did 15 minutes and 
told two stories in another working.

475
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,090
Great.
Yeah,

476
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:56,780
it's a,
it's definitely a good workout room.

477
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,163
Yeah.
I liked the belly room to the belly 

478
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,480
room.
Might be almost better sometimes because

479
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,240
so intimate.
So small.

480
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,800
What is it like 80,
80 people?

481
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,110
I have no idea.
Do they have those?

482
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,690
Uh,
I think they're going to do an there.

483
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,533
Got a new material show there tonight.
Have you ever done that with Nick 

484
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,360
Youssef?
I did.

485
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,490
I did that with you.
I did try that joke that,

486
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,324
uh,
about Helen Keller named frank came up 

487
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,813
with.
Was that the new material night or was 

488
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:21,370
that the standup on the spot night?

489
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,660
Stand up on the spot is Jeremiah Watkins
show where you just,

490
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,583
the audience will yell out topics.
You literally have no idea those 

491
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:30,610
dentists on the spot.
Yeah.

492
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:34,270
It was that one.
But the other one is Nick Youssef show,

493
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,193
which is a new material.
It's like you only stuff that you're 

494
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,000
working on,
like you know,

495
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,930
police yourself,
whether it's,

496
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,520
you know,
you've done it like 10 times,

497
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,860
you know,
it's not new anymore.

498
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,990
Like whenever,
whatever that number is where it becomes

499
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:48,460
not new,
but when it is new,

500
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,910
like this is like an opportunity to work
only on stuff that's brand new.

501
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,120
Yeah.
I,

502
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,610
my problem is I write on stage,
so like I like to take,

503
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,790
I like to just be on the fly and things.
I think the,

504
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,923
the adrenaline of the stage makes me 
think quicker and then a lot of times 

505
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,140
what I'll do is I'll write on stage and 
I will go for the easier punchline.

506
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,303
Like meaning,
like I'll get the premise will be good 

507
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,370
and sometimes I won't have the perfect 
punchline,

508
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:12,940
but I go,
oh,

509
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,640
that could be so much fucking better.
Right?

510
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,503
Yeah.
That's why that stand up on the spot 

511
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,380
show is perfect for you because you 
could just get loose.

512
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,460
I love that.
That's a fun show,

513
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:23,294
Dude.
It's a great way to come up with the 

514
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,344
material.
I think there's a bunch of different 

515
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:29,860
ways to come material and you gotta you 
gotTa do you gotTa do a mall if you can.

516
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,590
I tension to shit.
You know,

517
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,820
I haven't purged my act in forever 
because I've,

518
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,760
I've,
I had,

519
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,030
I literally had to shoot a special for 
seven years.

520
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,953
I was just working so I don't have 
enough time and man getting this hour 

521
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:43,834
out and putting it out and releasing it 
and knowing mean I'm married to the 

522
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:52,321
machine story,
but knowing that it's amazing what a,

523
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:53,494
what a,
what a blessing and a curse that is to 

524
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:57,760
be like,
like when I met you,

525
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:59,920
if you had said to me that first time 
you said,

526
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,963
hey man,
we're going to hang out and this is 

527
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:03,310
going to change your life.

528
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,970
You're going to tell one story and 
that'll be.

529
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,520
You'll be known as that.
It's going to be cool.

530
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,200
It's going to,
you're going to sell a book from it,

531
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,034
you're going to get tv shows and,
and you're going to do it our specials 

532
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:12,520
from it.
It's going to be fun.

533
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,010
I would have been like,
oh.

534
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:14,681
They're like,
fuck.

535
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,640
Yeah.
And then you have it and you're like,

536
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,660
I get it was a date the other night and 
I,

537
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm like 53 minutes into my set and 
someone's like telling the story.

538
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:23,014
Right?
And I'm like,

539
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,030
oh my God,
fuck last I'd have.

540
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,260
I've had people in the front row going,
don't worry man,

541
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,090
you don't have to do it tonight.
Oh my God,

542
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,063
it's fucking crazy.
You don't have to do it to like the 

543
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:38,170
toys.
Women always.

544
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:39,130
Women are like,
hey man,

545
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,901
I,
I'll,

546
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:40,450
I'll,
I'll,

547
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,283
I had a great time.
Even if you don't tell the story and 

548
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:43,840
I'll be like,
okay.

549
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,900
And then immediately it's,
it's

550
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,200
a dude who brought five of his friends.
He's like,

551
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,060
dude,
I told him,

552
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,280
you're telling the machine story,
you're telling them machine story.

553
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,180
And I don't ever want to let anyone down
if they do.

554
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,280
That is the coolest thing in the world 
that anyone knows me for anything.

555
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,250
And it's a great fucking story.
It's a great store.

556
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:02,084
It's all it is.
I literally sometimes don't believe it 

557
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:05,120
myself.
Like I go,

558
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:06,590
there's no way.
And,

559
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:07,424
but I've had people come to my shows in 
from my class stand up on stage with me 

560
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,750
100 percent.
True.

561
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,840
I wish I was there sort of like.
I'm sounding very dicey.

562
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,980
That's a great fucking story though,
Dude.

563
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:21,240
I remember when you were telling.
I was like,

564
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,460
what?
It was one of those do.

565
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,570
You've lived a very bizarre life.
Oh,

566
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,433
you don't fucking tell me you're such a.
it's very weird because you're such a 

567
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:37,020
nice guy too.
You're such a nice guy who's also a wild

568
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:37,854
man.
Yeah.

569
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,420
Yeah.
You've got this event,

570
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:40,254
a weird combination of traits and now 
you've had these wild fucking crazy 

571
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:46,140
experiences,
but you're a super friendly,

572
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,063
easy to hang out with guy.
You guys seen as much shit as you've 

573
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:52,980
seen,
all the different places.

574
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:55,950
You've been a little worn out by it.

575
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,120
I think when I got done birth to conquer
during that season I took.

576
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,180
I was like,
I need a break.

577
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,900
I was like,
I can't.

578
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,840
I need to do stand up because you get it
just tears on you.

579
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,783
We,
we had a conversation about it once you 

580
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,670
and bill burr one night talked about it.
That's right.

581
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,320
Yeah.
He said something.

582
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,440
You said something very fascinating to 
me that night.

583
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:16,274
You're like,
how much money is enough money like 

584
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,790
comparatively speaking,
like is it,

585
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,893
is spending the whole year away for next
for an extra like two double your money 

586
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,873
doesn't matter.
Or can you get by on this and really do 

587
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:32,150
what you love and be be filled with all 
the friends and the work that you love.

588
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:37,510
My problem is I know how funny you are 
and I know that there's no way you could

589
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:39,194
be at your best if you're off like 
months and months at a time doing that 

590
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:42,810
show.

591
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,400
I thought I was.
When you said that to me,

592
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:46,590
I was like,
I remember thinking like I.

593
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,080
I go up all the time,
but I was wrong.

594
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,500
I was lying to myself because I was 
going up once,

595
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:53,910
twice,
twice a month,

596
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,753
doing two dates out of the month,
but there was a whole portion of the 

597
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,430
month where I wasn't working.
I wasn't writing,

598
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:00,264
I wasn't thinking comedy.
That's the biggest difference when 

599
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,050
you're in production,
you're thinking production.

600
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:05,670
You're thinking,
what's our call time?

601
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,000
What's our heart out like your.
That's where your mind's occupied.

602
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,203
When you're a stand up man is just there
if that's all you're thinking like and 

603
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,283
that's how you get better at it and you 
have to be going up all the fucking 

604
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,060
time.
Like that's the other thing.

605
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:21,894
Man and I added me again changed my life
for the better by passing me at the 

606
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:28,260
store and letting me be a paid regular 
it,

607
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,060
it gave me so much more momentum and 
passionate about it.

608
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:32,894
So I was like fuck,
I'm going up to the best place in the 

609
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,330
world to do standup comedy and I'm 
getting spots when I,

610
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,010
whenever I call and I'll get a spot 
there.

611
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:39,690
Coolest fuck.
And I'm only home,

612
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:40,471
you know,
three days a week.

613
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:43,140
But if I'm going up twice a week or at 
least once a week,

614
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,660
if you really feel the difference in 
your act.

615
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,720
Yeah,
for sure.

616
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,030
And if you can go to other clubs too,
man,

617
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,880
like I like going to a,
sat at the Improv,

618
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,760
shoot over and do a set of the comedy.
So I've done three and nine,

619
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,313
which is big for La and New York.
They're laughing at us because those 

620
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:01,510
guys will do like 10 different sets of 
night hopping from one place to another.

621
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,760
But uh,
I've done um,

622
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,743
the laugh factory,
the store and the ha ha on one night or 

623
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,750
that the Improv,
the store and the ha all in one night.

624
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,793
So different man,
you do a set in one place and you get 

625
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:15,484
sort of a vibe of what comedy is.
Then you're in a set of just a 

626
00:27:17,441 --> 00:27:18,274
completely different energy in the room.
Completely different like vibe of the 

627
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:21,724
people.
And then all right,

628
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,890
bye folks.
And then you run over and do a different

629
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:25,870
set.
And that was a totally different vibe as

630
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:26,704
well.
And mostly I was going up with the same 

631
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,520
material.
So it was real strange.

632
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,600
So there's just like different fields to
different places in different crowds.

633
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,160
When Joey was,
we're getting ready for his hour,

634
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,580
he was hitting it mean easily to spot 
tonight and uh,

635
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,390
and we live right next door to each 
other practically.

636
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:47,700
So he just calls me up and he'd be like,
dog.

637
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,570
I got us down for two spots tight.
Like he would just call my avail in with

638
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:52,404
his and no,
we're going together and I go to the 

639
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:58,560
dark horse saloon.
The uniform was a fun look like fun dead

640
00:27:58,561 --> 00:27:59,400
room.
So when you like,

641
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,650
like meaning,
like it not packed out.

642
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,653
Joe is not promoting it,
I'm not promoting it and it's just 

643
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,020
people coming in to see a show and it 
was.

644
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,570
And you really got a vibe of like,
this works,

645
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,310
fuck Ya.
And then he'd be like,

646
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,540
well,
onto the Hahaha.

647
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,760
And I remember go to the job.
One time we went,

648
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,391
he was.
I said,

649
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:20,520
well let's go to the flappers in 
Burbank.

650
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,140
When we go to the Haha.
I go,

651
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:23,310
we go to Burbank.
And he goes,

652
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,690
and then we'll go to the,
ha ha,

653
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,550
I got a thing lined up.
I was like,

654
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,640
I've never been to the Haha.
I pull up at our faces,

655
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,820
our names were on the billboard.
Our faces are out there.

656
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,390
They meet us at the car.
Bert,

657
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,240
you're running late.
You got to get on stage right now.

658
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,250
I'm like,
Joey,

659
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,520
what did you sign us up for?

660
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,600
Didn't even tell you.
Booked a show.

661
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,350
He really is one of the funniest,
funniest,

662
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,240
like me.
And you said this today.

663
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:53,490
Bill [inaudible] is one of the funniest 
human beings alive.

664
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,310
Joey Diaz.
You can say that statement.

665
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,173
Exactly,
and it means the exact same fucking 

666
00:28:58,981 --> 00:28:59,490
thing.

667
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,260
We were just talking about that before 
you got here.

668
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,094
We were trying to figure out.
I think it's the running in my running 

669
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:08,970
for the two funniest people alive is 
burned Diaz as my running for me.

670
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,740
I was crying last night fucking crying 
and he just grabs the reigns.

671
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:14,574
Man.
He just grabbed the reins and ran with 

672
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:16,800
it.
It was beautiful.

673
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,820
You know when your soul,

674
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,750
like,
uh,

675
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,450
like he just made that up on the spot.
There's tolls like a,

676
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,200
like,
uh,

677
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,220
what did,
what did he say?

678
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,420
The pixelation of your soul and then you
watch they're going to take one of those

679
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:28,730
squares.
So yeah,

680
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,190
he's just fucking on.
It was a great analogy.

681
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:34,350
You and him.
I said this to Tommy this morning.

682
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:36,510
We talked about the show.
I was just.

683
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,820
I was literally walking.
I was walking around,

684
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,380
giggling,
recounting it,

685
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,230
and I told her tummy,
I said,

686
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:42,941
I said,
man,

687
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:43,774
I wish you had been there just to see 
burn Rogan because the two of you were 

688
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:48,970
the driving forces.
Doug was,

689
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,850
was really bringing in the reins.
Like he would be like,

690
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:53,140
all right,
what we're doing tonight,

691
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:53,921
and you're like,
Doug,

692
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,050
they already know that.
And like,

693
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,320
okay,
I'm gonna go check on Manson.

694
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,510
You and bill were the ones driving that 
and I swear to God when I say this,

695
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,590
I,
I literally started to move the mic from

696
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:07,030
my face because I was afraid I was going
to be.

697
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:09,790
I was laughing too much that you just 
hear me.

698
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,933
Just,
there was a point where I thought I was 

699
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,770
going to fucking pass out and I was like
breathing.

700
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,200
I never,
I have not laughed that hard in for ever

701
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,143
was also,
it felt like we were doing something 

702
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,833
cool like we,
we all got together and we joked around 

703
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:28,870
about this crazy thing that was 
happening for us.

704
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,360
And apparently folks,
the live stream,

705
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:33,020
if you're listening sucked.
I didn't,

706
00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:33,854
we didn't know.
We didn't know that you were only 

707
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,170
getting it through one ear.
I don't know what to do about that.

708
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,840
Uh,
the videos up now though on youtube,

709
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,490
the videos been fixed.
Powerful.

710
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:44,540
Jamie.
A full video.

711
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,374
So yeah,
the videos up and if we fixed the audio 

712
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:49,450
issues that were,
that existed before.

713
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,030
So it'll come at,
in both speakers.

714
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:53,800
Sorry about that.
That guest,

715
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,810
that was a really annoying thing to 
stream like that.

716
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:58,450
But whenever I kept thinking this could 
be.

717
00:30:58,451 --> 00:30:58,871
I mean,
not,

718
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:01,510
I'm not,
I don't think anyone on that stage would

719
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,120
do it for this.
This can be a fucking TV show.

720
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,780
I mean this.
But why?

721
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,980
Let's just do that.
Do that again.

722
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,870
So bill,
second thing is the TV shows.

723
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:11,704
I,
I did something today for a friend of 

724
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:12,920
mine.

725
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,460
He's got a car show.
And you went to him,

726
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:19,810
we were talking about suspensions and 
this kind of crafts a Steve Strope,

727
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,644
he makes all these really cool muscle 
cars and there's like this crew that's 

728
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:26,500
talking to them and they got cameras and
it's like,

729
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,780
and they're nice folks and nothing.
There's nothing wrong with them,

730
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,400
but it's just everyone's got this.
Okay,

731
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:31,710
now stand over here.
Yeah,

732
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,130
we're going to,
we're going to come towards you here.

733
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:35,590
So as we come around the car,
like that kind of Shit and you're like,

734
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:36,850
okay,
be not now,

735
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:38,000
be normal.
You know,

736
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:39,430
you try to be normal.
It feels weird.

737
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,293
Right?
But if you're just doing it like we're 

738
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:42,670
doing it,
like if you're,

739
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:45,010
if you're doing something like a podcast
like that,

740
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:46,300
just just a podcast,
that's it.

741
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,220
As soon as you start bringing in,
okay,

742
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,383
we're going to go live in five now,
can you pick it up from what you said 

743
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,020
about,
um,

744
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,210
the machine can do that machine thing 
again and you would have to do it again.

745
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,760
And you know what I mean?
Yeah.

746
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,023
If you wanted to do it as a TV show,
there'd be all sorts of other people in 

747
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,504
the fucking kitchen.
Let me get it manages in the soup day 

748
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,370
and you only do it for you to only do it
for 22 minutes.

749
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,151
Yeah,
exactly.

750
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:12,100
So that's where you lose the.
You lose the,

751
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,880
you lose everything.
It's live.

752
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:21,030
It's live and it's fun and it's friends 
busting each other's balls.

753
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,120
I'm talking shit about the world,
about how wacky this world is for Dan.

754
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,930
Hope out at being for my fucking face.
Herpes cold sores.

755
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,890
You son of a bitch.
That's true story though.

756
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,650
Was mocking him because he gets them on 
his penis and I was like,

757
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:40,400
oh,
but I got on my face

758
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,810
worse.
You could see them.

759
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,720
I love the way you start sentences 
though is so simple.

760
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,030
I have herpes.
He was on fire.

761
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,513
It was all firewood.
Fitzsimmons said something that didn't 

762
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:57,440
land.
Doug goes,

763
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:00,060
now I understand why talk shows have 
lead in question.

764
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,470
Yeah.
He was a little hostile.

765
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,490
Some of the guests.
He was definitely a.

766
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,120
At one point he was laying in my lap.
That's one of my favorite pictures of my

767
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:12,650
life.
Was He sucking on your nipple?

768
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,650
He sucked on my nipple.
When Sarah and bill started fighting too

769
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:16,484
much,
he would try to break up the tension by 

770
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:19,330
sucking on my nipple.
Wow.

771
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:20,923
Was a Sarah in,
but was it in entertaining the bill and 

772
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:25,010
Sarah thing?
It was for me.

773
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,250
I liked it.
I could,

774
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:26,960
but I don't.
I don't.

775
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,900
I don't hate either of them,
so I don't like.

776
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,650
I'm sure to the average viewer who maybe
doesn't know Sarah but loves bill,

777
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,240
they're like,
why would you disagree with him?

778
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,130
He's the best.
Right.

779
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:42,131
But the problem with those conversations
is as much as I would probably agree,

780
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,220
that's just my opinion and there's got 
to be someone out there that's like,

781
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:47,300
yeah,
Sarah.

782
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,170
Oh yeah,
yeah.

783
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,150
I'm sure there's people.
Oh,

784
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,993
there are definitely women that will.
I don't know if any women lot were when 

785
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:53,434
the live stream,
but we had four women watching the live 

786
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,313
stream.
You sure it was thousand humans at any 

787
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:00,560
given time.
How many people were screaming?

788
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:03,860
It was like 35,
30,

789
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:05,000
3000,
something like that.

790
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,870
Where you go,
holy crap.

791
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:09,500
So there was,
there's been videos that were up that we

792
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:12,590
took down on youtube.
They were up and they were private,

793
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,630
but there was,
the sound was fucked up still.

794
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:16,390
That's why there are private.
We're trying to fix this out.

795
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:19,130
So the full version is uploaded now.
Oh,

796
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:22,010
I know how they found that unlisted 
video because everyone,

797
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:22,844
every one of us tweeted the link to the 
video on our facebook live pages or 

798
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,030
facebook pages.

799
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,960
Oh,
I see.

800
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,450
Because I was looking for at this 
morning and I couldn't find it and I was

801
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:33,111
like,
wait,

802
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,790
did we not record that?
I was like,

803
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,160
that would stink if we missed that.
Oh yeah.

804
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,770
That would suck hard.
I forgot to hit record.

805
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,600
Um,
yeah,

806
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,430
that was a dude.
We could do that again.

807
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,713
Next time we do it,
we can't just have people just walk on 

808
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,250
stage and just sit down there.
I didn't know that that was going on.

809
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,760
And you know,
we have a specific amount of people that

810
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,640
we do it with because anything,
anything more than three or four.

811
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,363
Doug was putting people on stage because
he definitely put Brendan Walsh on 

812
00:34:59,421 --> 00:34:59,991
stage.
Oh yeah,

813
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:00,824
for sure.
But Brendan's a good friend known him 

814
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:04,550
forever and he wasn't even on for that 
long.

815
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,360
He's fucking hilarious.
He really is so funny.

816
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,720
He's so crazy to be here.
Doug was telling a story about Bingo,

817
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,970
having a seizure and hitting her head 
and Brendan goes,

818
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:17,060
I've had a few girlfriends have seizures
when they don't cook the food.

819
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:22,061
Right?
Oh Man.

820
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,853
Oh.
So if you've been paying attention to 

821
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:27,704
all these people's reactions,
everyone's trying to like figure out 

822
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:31,970
why,
why trump won.

823
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,973
It's really fascinating.
It's fascinating to see people freak 

824
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,350
out.
It's fat.

825
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,580
People are crying.

826
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,910
People are fucking cry or they stormed 
out of a school in Arizona.

827
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:46,860
The kids marched out of a school to 
protest the president elect.

828
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,470
Whoa,
whoa.

829
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,400
This is crazy now.
But there is a weird,

830
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,830
like there was a weird energy when trump
gave his speech last night.

831
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,440
It was almost like the bullies saying,
stop hitting yourself.

832
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:00,330
Stop hitting yourself.
Like he was like,

833
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,770
he was like,
now we can be like.

834
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,633
It was kind of weird because he has not 
been like super inclusive and then all 

835
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:06,594
of a sudden he's like,
we need to heal together and you're 

836
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:08,521
like,
hey,

837
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:11,070
you totally feel that way.
But like part of me goes on.

838
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,250
Is there a part of him that fucking 
hates everyone that doesn't like him?

839
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,720
Yeah,
for sure.

840
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,300
Yeah.
He certainly mean he's,

841
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,163
look,
he's a super businessman and super 

842
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:22,734
businessman there.
They're like their game players that 

843
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:25,650
play in a game.

844
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,070
So if you move towards them,
you know,

845
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,150
and you make a move,
they want to make a move to county,

846
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:32,580
you're moving fuck you up.
Like that's Donald Trump's personality.

847
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:35,010
That's why he sues all those people that
uh,

848
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,960
you know,
he's involved in altercations with.

849
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,600
He just fucking squash this shit.
He doesn't,

850
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,080
he doesn't like,
you know,

851
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,933
if people are talking shit about him,
but that's when once he become 

852
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:45,560
president,
like,

853
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,890
you got to let all that go.
Like you have to know,

854
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,690
you got to let all that.
You can't be tweeting.

855
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,890
Jon Stewart at 1:30
in the morning calling him a pussy.

856
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,900
She watched that video.
Oh God.

857
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:55,920
Yet,
it's hilarious.

858
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,750
You can't be tweeting Jon Stewart at 
1:30

859
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:59,820
in the morning calling him a pussy when 
you're in your sixties,

860
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,250
but he can't.
He can't do that.

861
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,610
Can't do that anymore.
You definitely now either president,

862
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:06,444
please stop doing that.

863
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,020
Don't do it.
You could think it,

864
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,090
but don't do it and even if you think 
it,

865
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,740
why are you even bothering?
What do you care?

866
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,300
They got to get rid of his twitter 
immediately.

867
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,830
Nope,
he knows he's bleeding.

868
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,910
He's keep tweeting.
Who Cares?

869
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,920
Why not?
Oh Dude.

870
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:25,860
Political correctness just took a 
missile to the Deq.

871
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,790
Now,
do you think,

872
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,880
do you think that's good or bad for 
standup on?

873
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,490
Unquestionably good.
Unquestionably good.

874
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,840
In every way,
shape or form?

875
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,010
Really.
Yay.

876
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:37,620
It's good because he's going to do some 
goofy shit.

877
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:41,010
He's going to say some ridiculous things
a week in it.

878
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,600
Right now.
If someone.

879
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:43,434
If you said something like,
I like to go up and grab them by the 

880
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,890
posies,
everyone will be like,

881
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,803
I.
That has to be acceptable because half 

882
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:53,250
of America is not offended by that.
Do you seat?

883
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,320
I'm a believer in that.

884
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,183
The president in a lot of ways shapes 
the mindset of the country because it's 

885
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,450
just a natural thing that happens in 
tribes.

886
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:04,603
You know,
if you have one fierce tribal leader in 

887
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:07,764
a tribe,
guarantee you the warriors that are in 

888
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:13,050
that tribal also be fierce because 
they'll be under the guidance of the one

889
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,090
wild fucking guy.
I mean,

890
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,430
that's how.
I mean,

891
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,600
that's how like fierce armies get put 
together.

892
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:20,280
You have to have a bad ass fucking 
general.

893
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,913
Well,
when your president is this guy who 

894
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:27,450
rarely gets riled up about anything,
he's not emotional at all.

895
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:31,320
He's super articulate and really well 
spoken and he's a great orator.

896
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,250
That's Barack Obama.
I mean,

897
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,760
that's what you would think of when you 
think of a presidential person.

898
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:39,670
He's probably the most presidential guy 
we've ever had as president,

899
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,920
but then you go with trump.
Like he's,

900
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,620
he's not doing that at all.

901
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,233
Like he's.
He's just rocking it at a totally 

902
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,910
different way.
A hundred percent.

903
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,280
Yeah.
He's doing it like a businessman.

904
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,260
You fuck with him?
He's going to fuck with you back.

905
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:54,700
You know,
you fucking piece of Shit,

906
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,340
Jon Stewart,
you posey.

907
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,600
Its real name is leave at 1:30
in the morning,

908
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,553
but that's the kind of guy that can 
fucking finance campaign for president 

909
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:10,831
all on his own and when it's crazy it 
ma,

910
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,123
I mean,
forget about whether you think it's a 

911
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,970
good thing for the country or bad thing 
for the country.

912
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,780
It might be the greatest success story 
ever.

913
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,950
It might be like the greatest upset of 
any contest ever.

914
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,920
One hundred percent.
There's no bigger upset ever.

915
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,293
Right?
Like what do you think the odds were 

916
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,720
when Donald trump first entered the race
in Vegas?

917
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:33,160
That he would eventually become 
president?

918
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:35,230
What do you think the odds were?
I remember watching,

919
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,900
I'm Seth Meyers,
state of the Union address,

920
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,700
and he said,
Donald Trump's here.

921
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,790
Donald Trump said he's voting as he's 
running as a Republican.

922
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,750
I thought he was running as a joke and I
doubled over and I thought.

923
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,270
I remember thinking to myself,
what,

924
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,030
what,
what an idiot healed.

925
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,903
He could never be president.
I literally thought he could never be 

926
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:56,134
president.
And then to think that that's a fucking 

927
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,940
reality.
Yeah.

928
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,013
It's interesting.
Has any celebrity other than we'll 

929
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,803
Ronald Reagan.
Ronald Reagan's one I was curious about 

930
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:10,060
because they said that I don't remember 
the election,

931
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:10,894
I was too young,
but they were saying that despite the 

932
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:16,400
fact that he had already been governor,
because that was like Kinda like he,

933
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,420
he had been an office.
They were shocked that anyone would vote

934
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:20,254
for Reagan.
They thought he was a fucking joke and 

935
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:23,620
dude,
he destroyed Mondale.

936
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,593
Like I look at those county by county 
polls where they show you what the 

937
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:28,930
counties voted.

938
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,660
It's really fucking interesting because 
you look at Ohio,

939
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:32,494
it's all red,
but Cleveland's blue and like Columbus 

940
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:40,391
is blue and Toledo's blue and so.
But the thing is all the,

941
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,390
just outside the city,
everyone's voting for trump,

942
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,620
but in a city people are voting for the 
Democrat.

943
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,510
But you look at,
if you look at Reagan's,

944
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,990
it's the.
I mean literally it's all fucking read.

945
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,830
Have you ever gone back and watched some
or Reagan speeches?

946
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,240
No,
I want.

947
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,280
I watched a few of them.
The other day I did.

948
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,893
I did a youtube rabbit hole.
I went down and watched a bunch of 

949
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:09,720
Reagan's speeches there were so weird,
so weird because now that he's dad and,

950
00:41:09,721 --> 00:41:10,554
you know the history,
it's so weird because it was in my 

951
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,750
lifetime.
I remember these events,

952
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,090
I remember these things happening,
but uh,

953
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,953
he was onstage onstage and doing some 
speech and he started talking about how 

954
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,643
wouldn't it be if we were attacked by 
some sort of an alien invader for 

955
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,320
another planet?

956
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,153
Wouldn't it be easy for us to abandon 
all of our differences and joined 

957
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:38,000
together as one race to,
to face this alien threat?

958
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,580
And everybody was like,
what the fuck did he just say,

959
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,190
save the fucking president.
Just say there's aliens.

960
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,840
That's what I heard.
I already said,

961
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,670
the fucking aliens are coming.
They're coming.

962
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,440
Oh my God,
we got to get together.

963
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,993
That's literally what he said.
And it was one of those conspiracy 

964
00:41:56,001 --> 00:42:00,680
theorists dreams where someone like me 
or like Eddie Bravo,

965
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,470
fucking look at it and go,
dude,

966
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,120
you hear what he just said?
Fucking hear what he just said.

967
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:08,900
He said if an alien species came down 
here to,

968
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,610
they're coming,
you're going to let us know.

969
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,750
Slow to go.
Let us know.

970
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:12,584
Slow.

971
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,613
I used to think,
I used to think they should release a 

972
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:19,660
tiger in every major city who chooses?
What about your kids?

973
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,970
Well,
I mean,

974
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:21,970
yeah,
that's just kind of.

975
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,710
We got to deal with the chips fall where
they may,

976
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,573
but the reason being,
imagine how tighter the communities 

977
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:29,320
would get.
People will be cooler to each other.

978
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:30,250
They'd be like,
hey man,

979
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:31,970
have you seen the tiger?
Oh yeah,

980
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:32,980
yeah,
he's on the other side of town.

981
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,570
Oh fucking.
Thank God man.

982
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,030
Have a great day.
Can't you shoot that tiger?

983
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:42,031
Or is it like you gotta leave it feeds.
It feeds off people.

984
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,613
That's the balance.
Or baby come into neighborhoods for 

985
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,783
gentrification.
Could you imagine if that's how we 

986
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:53,130
rocked it?
We just left a tiger and every $100,000

987
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,520
you to keep her at the time.
Like,

988
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,400
God,
it's a game with you and nature.

989
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:03,430
Shit.
Wow.

990
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:05,730
I mean,
when I was in,

991
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,700
when I was in Tanzania with the massage,
they have,

992
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:09,780
um,
their tigers,

993
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:13,590
lions are there big fucking deal and so 
they put,

994
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,483
I mean,
like they're crammed in together and 

995
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:18,240
they got thorns like thorn,
big thorn bushes.

996
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,220
Sure.
Keeping them together and they're always

997
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:21,054
together.
They're always in clumps because they 

998
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,060
got fucking lions everywhere.
Wow.

999
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,923
And I was like,
I bet that makes you a lot tighter when 

1000
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:28,980
you know you could get eaten by a 
fucking line.

1001
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,410
If you go take a shit by yourself,
you're like,

1002
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:32,820
hey man,
you gonna go hang out while take a shit.

1003
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,403
Well,
those people are so much more connected 

1004
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:39,840
to nature because how many animals must 
act get killed?

1005
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,853
Oh Dude.
I told you they cut a goat's throat in 

1006
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,640
front of me.
Like,

1007
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,301
like,
Hey,

1008
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:46,134
welcome to our jungle,
slit his throat and blend it into a 

1009
00:43:47,731 --> 00:43:49,230
horn.
So you could drink it.

1010
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,930
Yeah.
Just so casual.

1011
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:55,120
Doesn't taste like a little like liver.
Wow.

1012
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:57,690
Like a drinking liver.
It's probably super good for you.

1013
00:43:57,691 --> 00:43:58,524
Write it.
I didn't mind the taste other than the 

1014
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:02,610
fact that we get all in your 10 blood on
your teeth.

1015
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,310
I didn't mind that and it was Africa and
I didn't want to get aids.

1016
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,960
You didn't?
I didn't mind the taste.

1017
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,200
Yeah.
Imagine me.

1018
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:14,160
The first guy to get sick from that.
Like you,

1019
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:14,700
you,
you,

1020
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,533
there's,
I wonder like what kind of bloodborne 

1021
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,640
pathogens they could be carrying in 
their body that you're in,

1022
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,270
but this wouldn't that be in the meat 
to.

1023
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,360
I guess you'd probably have to worry 
that less with herbivores.

1024
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,913
Right?
Then you would like kicked and drink 

1025
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:28,560
bear blood.
You couldn't do it?

1026
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,700
No,
I don't think so.

1027
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,563
I think you can get tricky gnosis if 
they say something like 90 something 

1028
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:35,550
percent of bears of Kenosis.
Really?

1029
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,683
Yeah,
but how do you have to cook that out of 

1030
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:38,460
them?
Yeah,

1031
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:40,110
you have to cook it.
You Cook pork,

1032
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,690
which is 160 degrees.
Oh,

1033
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:44,210
I've been cooking pork.
Medium rare.

1034
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,323
Well,
now that you probably can get away with 

1035
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:49,140
that because you're talking about 
domestic pork.

1036
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,740
See the standards.
They actually lowered the temperature.

1037
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:55,920
I think they lowered the pork 
recommended to 1:40,

1038
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,320
which is really kind of like a medium.

1039
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,800
Not like I'm not a medium rare.
I think medium was like 1:35,

1040
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,590
but I'm A.
Anyway,

1041
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,010
I forget my point.
Bears blow yet.

1042
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,280
You have to cook bears.
He but,

1043
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,570
but you don't have to do that with like 
a deer and elk.

1044
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:15,270
You can eat like elk Sashimi.
We slice it.

1045
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,193
Oh,
I did,

1046
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,390
I did.
We do that with a bison.

1047
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,200
I think we ate part of the bisons heart 
or part of his liver.

1048
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,280
MMM.
Wow.

1049
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,420
Raw.
Yeah.

1050
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,370
Yeah.
People have done heart Ra.

1051
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:28,950
I've seen that.
It's crazy.

1052
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,180
It's going to dig that shit.
Yeah,

1053
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,980
like there's a part of me that's like,
you know,

1054
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,830
the big,
the anti,

1055
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:35,683
the big anti.
The n word for guys like me is called 

1056
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,600
call me Bro.
Bros.

1057
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,890
Bad.
Bad.

1058
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,940
That's like a,
that's the n word for like alternative.

1059
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,343
Like hipsters.
Millennials do not think it's as Bad as 

1060
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:49,200
the n word.

1061
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,000
I don'T think it is either,
but that's where like they go,

1062
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:51,834
oh,
he's just a,

1063
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,970
he's a bro.
Are you?

1064
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,370
Are you blowing out?
I think we have to embrace that.

1065
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:58,350
We have to take it.
I love being a bro dude.

1066
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,500
I fucking love it.
I love it.

1067
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,760
But yeah,
there's nothing wrong with that.

1068
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,230
But when you used to be able to say 
what's up bro,

1069
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,170
to your friend and really think that.
Yeah.

1070
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,480
And now it's like one of those weird 
things like bros,

1071
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:12,960
like a joke.
It's like a half joke.

1072
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,140
Yeah.
But I say brother to everyone.

1073
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,610
Pro science,

1074
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:18,810
Science?

1075
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,770
it's all I do.
I do bro.

1076
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:20,604
Science degrees with sciences.
When you talk about something like I 

1077
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:28,140
might watch a youtube video,
memorize some statistics and then recite

1078
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:29,010
it back.
That's bro.

1079
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:30,090
Science bro.

1084
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:45,870
Your rabbit holes take you to a ronald 
reagan's speech and mind.

1085
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:50,010
Always take Me to either stop being a 
douchebag videos or,

1086
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,680
or uh,
or bullied justice.

1087
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,670
Like instant karma.
I like watching the little kids.

1088
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,630
Little kids fight like a.
When one kid actually knows how to fight

1089
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,003
in high school.
There's this one girl and she's in this 

1090
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:05,540
fight with this.
Oh,

1091
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:06,374
she's a fight with a dude.
She might have been in a fight with a 

1092
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,110
dude,
but she didn't have a wrestling match.

1093
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:13,080
This kid,
and she clearly knows moitai because she

1094
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:15,800
fucking knees him in the face.
Hey,

1095
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,900
like,
like full fucking power.

1096
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:23,901
Really good technique crushes this dude 
crumples them and you watch and you go,

1097
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:26,190
whoa.
I like that.

1098
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,810
Somebody taught her how to fight.
Yeah.

1099
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,190
So we taught our fights.
I'm head start a fight with her.

1100
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,310
I think maybe she's the dickhead.
I dunno.

1101
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,090
I'd like to get my daughter's into like 
a base level is.

1102
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:37,663
Yeah,
so it's a girl and a guy watch this 

1103
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,153
douche or is it a girl?
Is that a girl that she just flattened 

1104
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:44,680
or is that a guy?
A boy?

1105
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,360
It's a boy due chief.
Yeah,

1106
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,220
it is a boy.
She flattened him.

1107
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,170
Holy shit.
we flattened him.

1108
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:51,170
Show that again.
Jamie,

1109
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,790
look at that.
She takes him down.

1110
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,460
She holds onto them and boom,
boom.

1111
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,294
Another name.
She through her whole body into that 

1112
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:03,460
knee.
She dId.

1113
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:07,570
She just fuck that dude up.
Like that's a girl who's seriously knows

1114
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:08,404
moitai that that would be like if you 
tried to fuck with john wayne 

1115
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,500
[inaudible] daughter.
He gave her a hard time.

1116
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:15,843
I want my girls to know him a little bit
of jujitsu just to protect themselves 

1117
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:19,170
from dudes.

1118
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,770
Look at the fucking technique,
man.

1119
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,200
Her knee.
Excellent.

1120
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,850
Excellent technique.
Position.

1121
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:27,790
Everything that girl absolutely knows 
how to fight.

1122
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,770
Like that wasn't luck.
Yeah,

1123
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:34,480
like she just smashed that dude.
I'd like to take the guy's an asshole.

1124
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,710
I'm sure he is hope so she might have 
just decided to beat up a boy.

1125
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:41,620
Send the message.
This is how I roll motherfuckers.

1126
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,260
Where does she run off to?
Some other girls were chasing her.

1127
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:46,810
She just ran off like super person.
Holy shit.

1128
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,790
You know,
there's that fight.

1129
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:49,683
There's that.
I always ended up watching this one 

1130
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:51,484
fight of these two guys in his parking 
lot and the one guy's like posted up 

1131
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:56,374
like this and the other guy clearly 
knows clearly knows like the beginning 

1132
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:01,494
at levels of an mma and it is.
And he fucks this dude up and you can 

1133
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,640
and it's just over and.

1134
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,440
But there's this energy.
Do you remember?

1135
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:09,683
Did you ever see a guy two guys about 
start fighting and then one guy clearly 

1136
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:16,720
knows has fought before and he's done 
like martial arts.

1137
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,441
And then the guy's like,
no,

1138
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:17,741
no,
no,

1139
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:20,770
no street fight only street fight only.
And the guy's like,

1140
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:22,210
no,
I'm not going to handicap myself so that

1141
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:25,170
you can win.
So there's no fighting words.

1142
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,090
What does that mean?
Street fighter street fighter.

1143
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,720
I've heard that before.
Oh yeah,

1144
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,810
I've heard that before.
And I've seen it in videos too.

1145
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,480
I heard it in college.
There was this guy who knew how to,

1146
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,760
who knew?
All brazilian jujitsu,

1147
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:38,740
everything.
and there was a big block party,

1148
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:42,520
k a s I used to a block party and he's 
talking shit.

1149
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,940
There was someone was talking shit.
And he hit his roommate's friend.

1150
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:46,803
He had his back.
Just got to hit a roommate so that you 

1151
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:52,270
just came into get protected.

1152
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,560
His friend,
his roommate,

1153
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,210
and this other guy is like,
oh,

1154
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:57,070
you want some motherfucker?
And he's just like,

1155
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,990
okay.
It was the way he moved,

1156
00:49:58,991 --> 00:49:59,824
it was very clear.
He knew what he was doing and the guy 

1157
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,031
was like,
no,

1158
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:02,261
no,
no,

1159
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:05,170
no street fight going to be a street 
fight and I'm going to be in like,

1160
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,140
no,
and then he fucking killed him.

1161
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,170
It's got to be a street fight.
What does that mean?

1162
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,213
What does it mean you're,
you're the one that told me like one 

1163
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:16,150
time I remember her saying,
I talked to somebody,

1164
00:50:16,151 --> 00:50:18,400
this must have been five years ago,
and you were like,

1165
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,630
do you know how to fight?
And I was like,

1166
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:20,231
no.
And you're like,

1167
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:23,050
why would you ever talk to someone if 
you don't know how to fight?

1168
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,400
And I was like,
I don't know.

1169
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:25,234
I've been going on that,
that mindset that my whole life just 

1170
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:31,520
rolling the dice that they'll back down.
That's dangerous.

1171
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:33,200
I don't talk shit to anybody.

1172
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,660
She never talked shit.
Well,

1173
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,870
first of all you shouldn't because it's 
just not worth it and it's a bad path to

1174
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,400
go down.
Then you get into arguments.

1175
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:42,220
People were probably all going to get 
into them again,

1176
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,950
but it's not good.
It's wAy better for you,

1177
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:45,784
for them,
for everybody to avoid those kinds of 

1178
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:49,780
conversations at all,
but when you start insulting people,

1179
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:52,000
you don't know.
God damn it so risky.

1180
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,160
It's so risky.
You don't know what they do.

1181
00:50:54,161 --> 00:50:55,390
They made.
That can be a killer.

1182
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,510
You don't know anything.
I mean like literally a killer.

1183
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,800
You don't.
You don't.

1184
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,693
You have no idea what that person does 
and so for you to just meet some 

1185
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,820
stranger,
bump into them and then want to exchange

1186
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,480
assault at each other,
you could have fucked up man.

1187
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,570
You could be sitting right next to 
lorenz larkin.

1188
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:16,540
You don't know who he is.
You know you decide to slap them.

1189
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,870
You get you do something stupid because 
you think you're a tough guy.

1190
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,140
Anything you can to intimidate him and 
he just laid kicks you when you realized

1191
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:24,550
like,
oh good lord.

1192
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,920
Then he starts beating the shit out of 
you slowly.

1193
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:28,450
Whenever he wants to,
he hits you.

1194
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,123
That's reality.
You could find yourself in a terrible 

1195
00:51:31,241 --> 00:51:32,074
situation.

1196
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,320
I don't even understand those guys who 
just simply talked,

1197
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:39,850
disrespectful to somewhat like that'll 
happen when you're with like as a comic,

1198
00:51:39,851 --> 00:51:40,684
you're on the road,
you're at a bar and someone's a fan of 

1199
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:45,960
yours and another guy's a fan of yours.
You'll watch them almost like attack.

1200
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,641
Like one guy,
oh,

1201
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:49,030
the drunk is will be a dick and be like,
oh,

1202
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:51,550
I guess we're all just gonna.
Sit up at the bar and you're like,

1203
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,301
hey man,
don't do that.

1204
00:51:52,301 --> 00:51:54,180
Like the guy,
the guy's just wants to hang out too.

1205
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,620
I can hang out with both of you.
It doesn't need to be one of the other.

1206
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,900
Yeah,
I mean I go,

1207
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:00,730
what the fuck you doing man?
Just to hAve a good time.

1208
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:01,983
Like why you to I'm not impressed.
Doesn't make me happy that you're 

1209
00:52:04,631 --> 00:52:06,910
mocking someone in front of me.
That's not funny.

1210
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,460
Right?
Wow.

1211
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,830
Some kinds of dudes can be douche bags.
No.

1212
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:18,490
I mean there's something about men's 
personalities and wanting to get ahead.

1213
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:24,060
wanting to fucking move ahead and line.
I got to meet next fucking competition.

1214
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:27,160
Motherfucker better not try to cut me.
You know?

1215
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,510
It's such a weird,
uh,

1216
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,640
there's a line and you're like,
hey man,

1217
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,173
people get crazy.
Some guys will walk straight to the 

1218
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:35,680
fucking front of the line to take 
pictures with their chicks.

1219
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:36,783
Doug benson is.
It happened to me one time and he was 

1220
00:52:37,811 --> 00:52:39,040
like,
why would you let that happen?

1221
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:40,420
And I was like,
I don't like confrontation either.

1222
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,020
That is a crazy move.
Okay man,

1223
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:43,863
I'm not waiting in this fucking line.
Let's get a picture of kind of getting 

1224
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,860
them to do that.
And I tell them that it's align and then

1225
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:48,694
they just stand there and I take the 
picture with the person who's at the 

1226
00:52:50,411 --> 00:52:51,670
front of the line and they go,
can we go?

1227
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:52,504
Now I know there's,
there's an actual line you can't just 

1228
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,680
cut in.
Like that's rude.

1229
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,860
Someone has to police this.
Yeah.

1230
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,690
Lines are lines.
Give me anxiety.

1231
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,610
What's the competition?
What am I going to get there?

1232
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,920
When's it gonna happen?
We're up next.

1233
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,510
How the fuck did she get in front of 
him?

1234
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,760
Was she in front of him before she is 
cut?

1235
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,823
Did she just cut?
Do somebody else the exact same amount 

1236
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:14,670
of people in front of you.
You start with,

1237
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,950
she just fucking cut front line for that
guy.

1238
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,650
Dude,
We were getting on.

1239
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:22,530
I was on my buddy cal heads cruise and 
that we were getting on back on the boat

1240
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,950
from st thomas and uh,
the law,

1241
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,420
there was a line to get back on the 
boat,

1242
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:31,200
but it wasn't a defined line.
It was just people like three wide,

1243
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:32,034
four wide,
sometimes too wide lining up down the 

1244
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:34,674
side of the pier.
And there were people just walking past 

1245
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:38,490
the line and I would be like,
hey,

1246
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:39,450
there's a line.
And he'd be like,

1247
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:39,870
no,
no,

1248
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:40,201
no.
Yeah,

1249
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:40,531
yeah,
yeah.

1250
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:42,270
And just keep walking.
And I'd be like,

1251
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,810
mother fucker.
Like,

1252
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:46,750
it drove me nuts like I was losing.
And then these,

1253
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,380
this one couple just got right in front 
of me and I went,

1254
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,550
hey,
you can't do that.

1255
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,170
And I know I feel like I'm in third 
grade.

1256
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,040
LIke,
hey man,

1257
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:54,361
no cuts.
No,

1258
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,950
but no interrupts man.
let's go.

1259
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,053
Like,
what did they say when you said you 

1260
00:53:57,541 --> 00:53:58,830
can't do that?
They were like,

1261
00:53:58,831 --> 00:53:59,250
oh no,
no,

1262
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,083
we're,
our friends were coming and I was just 

1263
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:02,100
like,
and then I'm like,

1264
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,000
okay,
I'm drunk.

1265
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,193
I'm not.
There's no reason for me to interact 

1266
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:07,140
with this person.
It's just one of those things like,

1267
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:09,750
do I take the path of least resistance 
and just go whatever.

1268
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:10,703
It's one fucking person.
Do I raise it worth getting into an 

1269
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:14,530
argument with one per,
you know?

1270
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,470
Right.
but there's something weird.

1271
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,120
Oh,
it's a fucking dick gregory.

1272
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,980
Oh,
I fucking hate it.

1273
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,300
Assholes.
I hope people do that.

1274
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:26,070
People do that at the airport,
dude.

1275
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,770
They do it everywhere all the time.
There's always someone,

1276
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,510
but it's not that many.
You know,

1277
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,400
if,
if you're dealing with thousanD people,

1278
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:33,670
you're going to get one at least.

1279
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,523
Right.
Just someone who just goes over the 

1280
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:36,090
rules.
don't apply to me.

1281
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,420
How many now you don't need a thousand.
Maybe 300,

1282
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,543
rIght?
Yeah.

1283
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,200
Every 300.
It depends on what fucking.

1284
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,700
If you're at a raiders game or 
something.

1285
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,130
Oh no.
Don't even get me started.

1286
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:50,850
I've been going to rams games.
Fog in lines there.

1287
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,690
Fuck that.
Football games are ridiculous.

1288
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,240
Oh,
the ram stadium,

1289
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,100
the coliseum,
it's like,

1290
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,600
it's like going back to,
to like deadwood,

1291
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:58,843
like it's fucking atrocious.
How much security do they have with 

1292
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:03,840
those things?
Not enough.

1293
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,440
And they've got only one exIt for every 
one.

1294
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,520
Meaning,
like meaning,

1295
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:11,460
like they don't have levels of exits for
tiers.

1296
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,110
If you sit up there,
you gotta walk out this way,

1297
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:14,760
if you sit down here,
you got to walk out this way.

1298
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,150
It's a fucking nightmare just to funnel 
it.

1299
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,580
It is a.
Yeah.

1300
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,990
And there's an have no refrigeration for
the uh,

1301
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,290
craft services or whatever.

1302
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:29,130
So like they run out of water.
No more water no more.

1303
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,520
We're out and you're like,
yeah,

1304
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,170
it's 90 degrees out here and there's 
92,000

1305
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:34,920
people.
Yeah,

1306
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,820
we're done with it.
It's like,

1307
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,700
it's literally must Be.
Would it be to be like in one of those?

1308
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,140
No,
that's not as bad as.

1309
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,063
Fuck.
I'm going to say one of those 

1310
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:51,810
shantytowns in africa.
There's no water at the football game we

1311
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:53,424
had to leave.
We're going to get our air conditioned 

1312
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:57,690
car and drive off white privilege.
Oh,

1313
00:55:57,691 --> 00:56:00,810
that's super white privilege.
It's like living in a shanty town.

1314
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:01,644
It's like rams game.
It's like a cardboard box under the 

1315
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,340
bridge.
Uh,

1316
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,690
yeah man.
It's just when you're inviting that many

1317
00:56:12,691 --> 00:56:17,691
men in a gigantic arena type place and 
then you having combat sport.

1318
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,380
Like football is a combat sport in my 
opinion.

1319
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,040
You,
it's not a combat sport.

1320
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,530
Like were you hitting each other all the
time with punches and kicks,

1321
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:28,660
but you're running into each other full 
blast.

1322
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,410
You know what the fuck you're doing.
You get Bigger so you could smash people

1323
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:33,700
better.
It's a combat sport.

1324
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:35,560
God dammit.
That's what it is.

1325
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,060
What's the dark?
Is there fights in ufc?

1326
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:39,830
Oh,
uh,

1327
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,290
occasionally.
Yeah.

1328
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,360
occasionally.
Less than you would think.

1329
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,380
Really?
Yeah.

1330
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,320
You're going to get drunk people 
together.

1331
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,690
You know,
maybe one person's cheering a little too

1332
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:50,524
loud for someone you don't like and 
calling the guy you like a loser or 

1333
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:56,500
whatever people do.
I've seen some brawls,

1334
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,300
but uh,
for the most part,

1335
00:56:58,301 --> 00:56:59,140
not really,
man.

1336
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,153
You know,
I think a lot of people also go to see 

1337
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,780
mma.
Like if you go to see it live,

1338
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:05,614
it's expensive,
you know you want to go check out the 

1339
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:10,330
ufc,
live it does things sell out like that.

1340
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:11,463
This madison square garden thing that 
people were going to be excited to be 

1341
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:15,244
there.
They're not going to fuck up the 

1342
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:16,414
experience hopefully,
but if you're next to the wrong person 

1343
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:24,361
ever in life in a live setting,
whether it's a comedy club or a concert,

1344
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,653
you could be next to the wrong fucking 
person and they could ruin the 

1345
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:28,834
experience

1346
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,713
we were behind.
We were in front of the wrong person on 

1347
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:34,940
one game because there's this guy and 
all raiders gear and he just kept saying

1348
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:36,620
to people,
how long have you been around savannah?

1349
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,330
Oh,
you brand new in.

1350
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,350
Okay.
that's what I thought.

1351
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,000
And you're just like,
why?

1352
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,530
What do you.
What is this doing for you?

1353
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,320
is he a mexican gentleman?
He just did them in a mexican accent.

1354
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:49,890
did I didn't mean to.
I'm really bad at accent.

1355
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:54,470
he's iris.
How long have you been a resident?

1356
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:56,810
Would land are you from?
He said to me,

1357
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:57,644
he said it to me.
My kids are sitting in front of me who 

1358
00:57:58,701 --> 00:58:00,260
doesn't know that they're my kids.
Right.

1359
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,170
So mY kids sit in front of you.
I'm sitting with my buddy,

1360
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,730
eric,
and he's just like,

1361
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,700
how long have you been a I?
And my buddy eric grew up here,

1362
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:08,720
so he's like,
my whole life.

1363
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,040
He wAs like,
oh really?

1364
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:10,791
Where are you from?
And he was like,

1365
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,830
I grew up in the valley or santa monica.
He's like,

1366
00:58:12,831 --> 00:58:13,550
well,
okay,

1367
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:14,510
how about you?
And I was like,

1368
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,520
um,
this is my first game.

1369
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,890
I'm a big fan,
and I just,

1370
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:20,500
he just caught off guard and he giggled.
He was like,

1371
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:21,291
ah,
that's what I thought.

1372
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,970
Yeah,
I know I'm from here,

1373
00:58:22,971 --> 00:58:24,080
man.
I'm from here.

1374
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,000
And you're like,
okay,

1375
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,590
irish people don't talk like that.
I know I can.

1376
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:31,200
I'm really bad at accents.
He was like,

1377
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,130
he was like,
I love the chorus eum uh,

1378
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,870
that's,
that's like japanese from the 1951.

1379
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,630
I'm so bad at accent.
He's like,

1380
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:43,400
my man.
I said,

1381
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:45,170
can I get some compensation?

1382
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:47,590
Yeah,
to a rams game.

1383
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,610
I just think football in general and 
combat sports in general.

1384
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,950
And he'd get a bunch of men together and
you give them booze.

1385
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,320
Shit's going to go wrong.
Like.

1386
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,200
And if you're only telling me there's 
only one way to get out of there.

1387
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,320
That's not in my book of safe places to 
be.

1388
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,060
No.
did you ever.

1389
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,130
Do you remember the xfl?
Yes.

1390
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,350
That was the um,
what the fuck's his name?

1391
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,220
Vince mcmahon.
Yeah.

1392
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,330
Yeah.

1393
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:11,250
I went to an xfl game.
How was that?

1394
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,113
Holy fucking shit.
That was what a prison yard must feel 

1395
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,440
like.
Really,

1396
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,940
really,
like,

1397
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:23,600
I rememBer I remember a,
a fight broke out and the cops went into

1398
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:25,514
the stands from the field to get the guy
and the fans kicked the cops out of the 

1399
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:32,600
stands.
Whoa.

1400
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,493
Like they.
And they had the guy and they put the 

1401
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,870
fans,
pulled the guy back into the stadium and

1402
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:41,780
push the cops onto the grass.
And the cops just were like,

1403
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:44,390
I guess like guys going free.
Holy shit.

1404
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,890
They gave out that game.
They gave out like cardboard flyers.

1405
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,170
Like,
I don't know what it was like,

1406
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,073
you know,
so you could all hold them up and you'd 

1407
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:52,594
all make the same color or whatever,
but everyone was just turning them into 

1408
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:59,531
paper airplanes and they were throwing 
darts and I saw dude turn around and get

1409
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:03,680
hit in the eye with one and leave like,
oh and leave.

1410
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,513
And I was like,
he had hit and I was a dark with the 

1411
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:07,243
paper airplanes,
but they weren't made out of cardboard 

1412
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,820
and people were turning them into paper 
airplanes,

1413
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:11,863
but they were flying like fine and it 
hit the guy in the eye like three rows 

1414
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:17,540
in front of me and he just doubled over 
and walked out and was like,

1415
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,290
that kind of money just lost a fucking 
eye for an xfl game.

1416
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,110
I was like,
I got recognized a lot there too.

1417
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,280
When did the xfl exists?
ProbablY 2001.

1418
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,910
Wow.
and I was on a tv show.

1419
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,080
What?
What should we on Back then?

1420
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,370
The next show you were on it.
Oh,

1421
01:00:34,371 --> 01:00:36,680
that's rIght.
And vince mcmahon,

1422
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:39,970
you came onto me three times.
Which I was.

1423
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,813
Oh yeah,
that's right.

1424
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,500
And vince,
vince mcmahon,

1425
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:47,390
or someone came on to promote the league
and so we got as cast members,

1426
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,220
we all got free tickets and we were 
like,

1427
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,083
oh,
this will be nice.

1428
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:51,203
No,
there were gen pop and it was fucking 

1429
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:57,050
brutal.
But we had just promoted the games on tv

1430
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,423
and a while.
I remember walking through and 

1431
01:00:59,241 --> 01:00:59,781
everyone's like,
oh,

1432
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,280
you're that fucking guy.
And I was like,

1433
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:02,114
yeah,
what's uP?

1434
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,010
I remember when you were doing hurt 
burt.

1435
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:06,140
God,
that waS the first,

1436
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,013
uh,
tv stuff that I was aware of that you 

1437
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:09,050
were doing.
Yeah.

1438
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,190
I was like,
oh my god,

1439
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:12,320
someone's going to talk to this guy.
You gotta stop doing that.

1440
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm not fucking doing.
I should ever again.

1441
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,953
Yeah,
like you'd let people choke you 

1442
01:01:16,011 --> 01:01:16,844
unconscious.
You let some of the gracie brothers 

1443
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:18,980
choke unconscious.

1444
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,320
Who did it?
Which was,

1445
01:01:23,321 --> 01:01:24,530
it was at henner.
He run.

1446
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,100
Who,
uh,

1447
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,690
who choked you out?
I can't remember.

1448
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:27,720
It was.
It was.

1449
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,980
It happened so quick.
It's getting choked out.

1450
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:33,680
Is such a fucking scary feeling because 
it really proves.

1451
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,920
It proves your helplessness.
You're helpless for sure.

1452
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,230
For one of those guys.
One of those guys gets a hold of you.

1453
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,123
It took two seconds.
He just went and grabbed my kimono and 

1454
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:43,244
uh,
and just tighten it around my neck and 

1455
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,393
yeah.
And I rememBer reaching up to stop him 

1456
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,410
and hitting him once and then being 
like,

1457
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,273
I can't stop this and falling out.
And then I had panic attackS for like a 

1458
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,760
week because I knew it was like to 
suffocate and die.

1459
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,640
Jesus.
I literally,

1460
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,770
I remember I'd be fucking laying in bed 
and I just go,

1461
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,880
those looking crazy.
Whoa.

1462
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,330
I wish at that time.
You know what's so funny?

1463
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:15,530
I'm horiaN is the father who early on 
said to me,

1464
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,320
you could benefit from jujitsu.
He's like,

1465
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:19,800
why don't you come?
No charge.

1466
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:19,980

1471
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:25,920
My head,
I'm like,

1472
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,753
oh,
I don't want to do jujitsu for god in 

1473
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,790
that would have helped me so fucking 
much.

1474
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,300
I still do it.
Uh,

1475
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,720
I talked to eddie bravo.
We had talked about thiS one time and so

1476
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,110
I think you are someone.
Maybe you'd set me up with eddie bravo.

1477
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:37,501
Well,

1478
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:39,660
Well you know,

1480
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,280

cranes place?

1481
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,720
I talked to anybody's going,

1482
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,651
Yeah,
I think so.

1483
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:48,300
I don't know.
He goes every a lot.

1484
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,490
Yeah,
but I talked to eddie problem.

1485
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,250
Eddie bravo came in and he had a black 
eye and I went,

1486
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,080
what happened?
Did you get in a fight?

1487
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:55,970
And he was like,
huh?

1488
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,900
He ain't even know he had a black guy.
He was like,

1489
01:02:57,901 --> 01:02:58,770
what?
I said,

1490
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:00,240
your eye is swollen.
And he goes,

1491
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,410
oh,
it's just from rolling is.

1492
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:02,700
Yeah,
it's not that bad.

1493
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:03,740
And I was like,
wait,

1494
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,680
you get black eyes?
He was like,

1495
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:05,131
yeah,
yeah,

1496
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:07,920
he can bumps from bumps.
And I was just like,

1497
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,783
oh,
I don't want to get knocked my teeth 

1498
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:10,554
out.
It can happen when you were a 

1499
01:03:11,461 --> 01:03:12,294
mouthpiece.
I've only gotten a black guy like maybe 

1500
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,960
10 times ever 10 times,
maybe,

1501
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:19,853
maybe 10 times.
You knoW,

1502
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,920
that's a lot.
I mean,

1503
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,460
from jujitsu.
yeah.

1504
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:28,080
Do you think all the times you're 
rolling and rolling ever?

1505
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,400
Yeah.
That's hilarious.

1506
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,020
Yeah.
I've had two black eyes.

1507
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,900
I have a lot of black guys.
I think,

1508
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:35,340
um,
how many black guys have you had?

1509
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,520
Maybe two or three out and not that 
many.

1510
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,533
There's um,

1511
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:44,100
a picture of me when I was doing the ufc
had too fucked up eyes while I was doing

1512
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:46,190
the commentary commentary.
Terry,

1513
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,063
that was all from my same friend.
He got me with the knee and then he got 

1514
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:51,450
me wIth his elbow.
Totally accidental.

1515
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,120
Ow.
It hurts so bad when you're scrambling.

1516
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:55,403
If you know you move that way and that's
where he was going to put his knee and 

1517
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:58,834
he just,
he just fucking collide with each other 

1518
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,950
dudes.
Noses explode.

1519
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:03,330
Happens all the time.

1520
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,130
yeah,
I,

1521
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,420
I not,
not that I don't want that to happen,

1522
01:04:07,421 --> 01:04:09,230
but I just don't.
Yeah,

1523
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:09,900
I know.

1524
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,050
but you got to also look,
be careful.

1525
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:13,913
Don't roll with spazzes.
Don't try to be a world champion 

1526
01:04:16,471 --> 01:04:19,530
superstar.
Learn how to do the technique correctly.

1527
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:22,500
Be willing to tap and just try to learn 
and have fun.

1528
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:25,260
The gracies have a good saying,
they say keep it playful.

1529
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,270
I think that's a good saying to learn 
it,

1530
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,143
you know,
because as soon as you get tense and 

1531
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,960
real rigid and real concern with the 
outcome,

1532
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,153
you,
uh,

1533
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:34,080
you,
you just don't do as well.

1534
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:34,831
You know,
it's become,

1535
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:37,470
it's too exhausting and you don't 
concentrate on technique,

1536
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,660
you know,
like if you're not worried about getting

1537
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:41,640
tapped or you're not worried about 
getting into a bad position,

1538
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:43,890
you'll relax and sort of go with the 
flow of things.

1539
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,560
And when you find like a certain level 
of efficiency,

1540
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,560
then you can operate,
you can roll for like long times.

1541
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,510
I've had roles with people that were 
like 10,

1542
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:52,344
15 minutes long or even longer because 
if you get to a good place we can kind 

1543
01:04:56,041 --> 01:05:00,240
of conserve your energy and you're both 
moving at a good pace.

1544
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,480
Good pace,
but keeping it really technical to.

1545
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,880
It's an amazing martial arts.
Like one of the,

1546
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:10,620
to me it's one of the only martial arts 
that does as advertised.

1547
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,360
Like when you look at martial arts,
you always think of what I would like is

1548
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,293
some Bruce Lee type scenario or the 
small could beat up everybody around 

1549
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:21,280
him.
Well striking.

1550
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:24,210
That really doesn't work like that.
It just does it.

1551
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:24,661
Yeah.
Yeah.

1552
01:05:24,661 --> 01:05:26,120
I was just doesn't,
you know,

1553
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,020
brock lesnar is just as bad ass as 
joseph benevidez.

1554
01:05:30,021 --> 01:05:33,160
As brock lesnar was chasing him down.
He'd be kind of fucked.

1555
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,500
He just be kind of fucked.
That's just too much.

1556
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:36,640
There's just too much man.

1557
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:37,893
But if brock lesnar road,
like if he did jujitsu with like a guy 

1558
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:46,840
like gary tonin who just won the ebi 
this past weekend,

1559
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:49,900
he won the heavyweight division.
He's a 100 sixTy nine pounds,

1560
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:50,770
I think it is.
Champion.

1561
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,490
And he went up and he won the 
heavyweight division two.

1562
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,430
Oh five I guess is the way class.
But I'm.

1563
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,620
That guy would choke out brock lesnar 
most likely.

1564
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:01,140
So brock lesnar when he's,
uh,

1565
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:03,280
when he's fighting,
he's not doing jujitsu.

1566
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,740
He doeS jujitsu and he's fucking 
gigantic,

1567
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:06,783
but he's not.
I think [inaudible] has got his blue 

1568
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:10,990
belt.
See if that's correct.

1569
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,870
Brock lesnar got his blue belt on,
brock lesnar got his purple belt,

1570
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:16,240
might be his purple belt.
Is he using mOre wrestling techniques?

1571
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:17,620
Yeah,
he's a freak wrestler.

1572
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,630
I mean absolutely.
You know,

1573
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:23,080
as far as like amateur wrestlers go,
super successful two time.

1574
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:24,430
Ncaa all american.

1575
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:29,110
I saw a video of him as a collegiate 
wrestler beast and there were,

1576
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,330
I guess it's like a documentary that's 
coming out or something.

1577
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,193
Yeah.
And I was like god he was here and he 

1578
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:37,240
was fucking the same brock lesnar that 
fucking scary.

1579
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:39,520
Look what's he got there?
Blue belt?

1580
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,960
Yeah.
I got a new blue belt.

1581
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:42,170
Yeah.
Well,

1582
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,230
so what's so what's it go?
It goes white,

1583
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,400
white,
blue.

1584
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,800
Well it Depends.
Some people get weird,

1585
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:50,980
they hAd a bunch of stuff,
but this is most jujitsu schools because

1586
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:53,590
taekwondo is very different.
but jujitsu is white,

1587
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,360
blue,
purple,

1588
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,350
brown,
black.

1589
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,900
So some people put stripes and stuff in 
there.

1590
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,033
John john was never really ended that 
john jack would just go from belt to 

1591
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:05,450
belt and eddie just goes from belt to 
belt and um,

1592
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,290
it's all just,
it's up to them too.

1593
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,330
It's not like a test,
which is kind of weird,

1594
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,613
like everywhere else in taekwondo,
you would have to learn forms and have 

1595
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:15,400
to learn these,
uh,

1596
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,410
these little jabs at Japan.

1597
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:21,100
They call them katas and these are a 
bunch of like knife,

1598
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:22,690
hand strike,
sidekick,

1599
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,200
knife,
fence,

1600
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,033
trike,
sidekick.

1601
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,990
It's like a dance that you're doing,
you know,

1602
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:26,863
just this preformed thing.
And you had to know these things in 

1603
01:07:29,561 --> 01:07:30,394
order to get certain Belts.
So like if you were a purple belt and 

1604
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:35,680
you wanted to become a brown belt or is 
it a red belt?

1605
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,090
Yeah,
it was.

1606
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:40,210
I think it went in taekwondo.
I think it went purple,

1607
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:43,120
red for a member correctly.
Purple,

1608
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:44,230
red,
green,

1609
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,311
blue,
green,

1610
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,510
purple,
yellow,

1611
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:47,261
blue,
green,

1612
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:49,540
purple,
red,

1613
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,500
black.
I think that's it that.

1614
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,320
But it's different than others.
Some schools,

1615
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,510
some schools,
they would not have the red.

1616
01:07:55,511 --> 01:07:56,890
They would have a brown.
I can.

1617
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:58,630
Karate was always brown.
It wasn't red.

1618
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,940
And jujitsu,
red is like the super master.

1619
01:08:00,941 --> 01:08:01,774
They have like a coral belt for guys 
like hixon gracie and john jacques 

1620
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:04,390
machado.

1621
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:05,900
They give them this red belt,
you know,

1622
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,210
who gives it to them,
their master.

1623
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:12,670
They asked to see someone of 
commensurate achievement in jujitsu.

1624
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:15,980
Like you have to get it from one of the 
great masters.

1625
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,371
There's,
you know,

1626
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:20,780
there's a bunch of great masters out 
there like henzel gracie hoists,

1627
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:22,580
gracie,
you know,

1628
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:23,623
there's like the old guard to like hixon
of course fixing gives you your coral 

1629
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:28,454
belle.
He gave.

1630
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,360
He gave john jacques machado was coral 
belt.

1631
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,950
That's just so.
It doesn't get any,

1632
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,510
like,
more prestigious.

1633
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:39,410
You know who john jack is a,
he's a really special guy.

1634
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:44,190
His jujitsu is so technical and he's 
like,

1635
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:45,043
he was also instrumental in making 
certain techniques work in mma because 

1636
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:50,924
john jack was born with one hand is 
deformed and all he has is a thumb on 

1637
01:08:55,941 --> 01:08:56,774
his left hand.
He doesn't have any fingers and because 

1638
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:01,304
of that,
um,

1639
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,173
he,
he figured out that he can't rely and 

1640
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:06,260
grabbing the jujitsu.

1641
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,120
He can't,
or the kimono,

1642
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:08,954
whatever you want to call it.
He cannot rely on holding on to collars 

1643
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:13,760
and grabbing sleeves and manipulating 
people with that.

1644
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:14,594
Instead,
he switched to over hooks and under 

1645
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:19,130
hooks and went to a more wrestling base 
control,

1646
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,760
so when jujitsu went from being gay 
based,

1647
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:26,220
primarily in competition to,
they started doing abu dhabi.

1648
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:27,543
Abu dhabi was nogi and when when they 
went with the abu dhabi submission 

1649
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:34,370
fighting championships,
john jacques dominated people.

1650
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,860
Really one of the reasons why dominated 
he's because he's awesome.

1651
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:39,680
He's just a super high level world 
champion black belt,

1652
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,370
but two,
because he had never relied on the geek.

1653
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:44,893
He was just about holding bodies.
He was all over hooks and under hooks 

1654
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:52,391
and it translated perfectly in mma.
Eddie bravo learned that from john jock.

1655
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:53,373
He learned that from watching john 
jacques and from training under john 

1656
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,340
jacques and getting his black belt under
him and so eddie developed his style and

1657
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,400
eddie branched out away from the gate 
though.

1658
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,233
It's like a big controversial thing.
When he stopped wearing a gi and he 

1659
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,284
started teaching nogi jujitsu,
like people got upset at him and the 

1660
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:11,730
jujitsu community that he was abandoning
the gay.

1661
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:12,950
It was like a big deal.
Yeah,

1662
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:15,650
and he's a revolutionary man.
He really is.

1663
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:16,523
It's in when it comes to jujitsu,
that guy has a crazy database of 

1664
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:21,464
information in his head when it comes to
like jujitsu moves and a lot of it he 

1665
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:29,420
learned because he learned john jocks 
the at least the base of his style,

1666
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,060
which john jack developed because he 
couldn't grab onto things.

1667
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:35,120
Really interesting.
That's really interesting.

1668
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:36,680
No,
this is a silly question.

1669
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:37,703
Could could Bruce Lee really fight?
I'm sure Bruce Lee could fuck up a lot 

1670
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:42,720
of people if you will.
Yeah.

1671
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:43,583
You watched him throw kicks and punches.
That guy definitely knew how to hit 

1672
01:10:45,981 --> 01:10:48,760
things and there's some video of him 
sparring it.

1673
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,220
Definitely where he did some sparring,
so that means if you've done sparring,

1674
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,710
like if you've never hit anybody before,
boy,

1675
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:58,190
that's a weird moment.
Like even wHat do you hit?

1676
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,990
You hit bags.
You don't hit a bag either.

1677
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:00,824
Okay.
Do you ever have anybody hold the myths 

1678
01:11:01,581 --> 01:11:02,414
for you and no.
Nothing and just kind of try to hit a 

1679
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:04,304
person as a.
It's not easy to hit people hitting the 

1680
01:11:06,351 --> 01:11:07,184
person is.
It doesn't feel like You think it's 

1681
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:09,440
going to feel.
It feels weird.

1682
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:12,530
It feels really weird,
um,

1683
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,300
after being hit.
Feels totally normal.

1684
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,280
Does It?
When you get hit you're like,

1685
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,570
there's no weirdness to it.
You're like,

1686
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:19,583
oh,
that's just like what I remember when I 

1687
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:23,250
ran into my friend's elbow.
That's the same feeling.

1688
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,590
Yeah.
Unless you get tuned up on your jaw.

1689
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,180
Oh,
never popped a new job.

1690
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:29,580
No,
that's a weird feeling because your legs

1691
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,450
just stopped working.

1692
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:31,973
I got dropped in a kickboxing match.
I got dropped with a left hook and my 

1693
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:37,500
legs just so they just shut off.
They were like,

1694
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,360
shut off.
My legs just shut off.

1695
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,820
They like,
stopped working like somebody.

1696
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:44,850
I thought that when you got hit on the 
john,

1697
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,590
you went down like that because you were
hurt.

1698
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,410
And because like,
uh,

1699
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,141
like,
oh my god,

1700
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:50,670
this hurts so much.
I have to fall down.

1701
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,780
Like almost.
Yeah.

1702
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:52,703
But it's not really that.
It's something hAppens when you get hit 

1703
01:11:56,401 --> 01:12:01,290
with like a perfect knockout punch or 
just a knockdown punch when your jaw,

1704
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:03,570
when they connect with your jaw and your
jaw,

1705
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:08,571
like displaces all that energy on that 
pivot of your jaw and the brain stem and

1706
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:11,184
your spine and whatever.
Fuck Is getting damaged in there when 

1707
01:12:13,381 --> 01:12:15,690
your jaws rattling around inside of your
head,

1708
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:20,870
but it sends a spark like a and your 
shit just goes really?

1709
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:22,620
Oh dude,
you just get shut off.

1710
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,580
It's weird.
And mine was a like,

1711
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,423
I would say a half shut off because I 
was still conscious but my legs stopped 

1712
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:30,374
working,
but I was still super aware that I was 

1713
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:34,080
in a fight.
I knew exactly what was going on.

1714
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:36,030
I knew I just got tagged and I knew,
whoa,

1715
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:37,950
this has never happened to me before.
I never had my legs give out.

1716
01:12:37,951 --> 01:12:39,060
Like she didn't go to sleep.
No,

1717
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:39,390
no,
no,

1718
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:39,870
no.
I was like,

1719
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:43,560
onlY 50 percent there.
But I've of course seen every variety of

1720
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:47,160
that and sometimes you'll see a guy gets
shut off with a punch.

1721
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:49,140
Like someone just hit someone with a 
perfect punch,

1722
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,090
like you remember when manny pacquiao 
fought one,

1723
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:53,670
one mil.
Juan manuel marquez the last fight.

1724
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:55,050
See?
Oh my god.

1725
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,390
One of the greatest.
All time.

1726
01:12:57,391 --> 01:12:58,860
One punch.
Knockouts packing.

1727
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,693
I was charging in and this is I think 
the third or the fourth time they had 

1728
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:06,020
fought each other.
Maybe the third and one men.

1729
01:13:06,021 --> 01:13:06,854
Well mark as an corks.
the perfect right hand on packing house 

1730
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,970
face.
Oh I didn't see that.

1731
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:15,420
I did face plants and he's out for a 
long ass time.

1732
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:18,330
He just face plants.
Yeah,

1733
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,130
it was,
it was.

1734
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,790
Watched it blow.
Yeah.

1735
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,823
I mean that is a god damn perfect punch 
when you can knock a guy like that 

1736
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:27,900
completely out.
So that's,

1737
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,033
that's like,
that's the highest level that you 

1738
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:32,880
achieve.
Oh jesus.

1739
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:33,714
Hitting that spot.
The highest level is eveRything stops 

1740
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:37,343
and they got to wake you up and you 
probably don't even Remember what 

1741
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:39,684
happened,

1742
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:42,443
but

1743
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,080
I never got to that.
Um,

1744
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:46,060
I never got hit and had that happen to 
me.

1745
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:46,894
But having that halfway thing happened 
where your legs just stopped but you're 

1746
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:50,500
awake and you know exactly what 
happened.

1747
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,200
It's such a weird feeling of 
vulnerability.

1748
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:55,150
Like I didn't even know that was the.
He's a button there.

1749
01:13:55,151 --> 01:13:55,984
I didn't even know it was there.
Like you don't really know what is it 

1750
01:13:57,761 --> 01:13:59,260
that happens?
Is it a nerve that.

1751
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,550
Something like that.
Yeah,

1752
01:14:00,551 --> 01:14:01,384
something I've explained it and then it 
had someone correct me and say that's 

1753
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:07,240
not scientifically correct.
We're talking which shocker bro.

1754
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:08,074
Science.

1755
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,063
But about something happens when you get
punched in the jaw that your jaw of 

1756
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,100
rattles against your spine.
They go,

1757
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:15,970
well,
I'm not really.

1758
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,811
I'm like,
well,

1759
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:18,320
okay.
Well what does happen is like,

1760
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:21,340
is it the spin of the head?
Like what is it that makes sense?

1761
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,960
Because there's.
ThAt's one thing,

1762
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:26,260
like what's happens if you get clipped.
He noticed that people's jaws,

1763
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,920
they had fucking bounces around a lot on
the impact.

1764
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,740
Like if you get caught with a really 
good body shot,

1765
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,840
you get dropped,
right?

1766
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:34,960
Boom.
You get hit,

1767
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:36,543
you get dropped.
Your body's kind of absorbing all the 

1768
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:42,760
shock of that punch.
but your head when your head absorbs it,

1769
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:44,163
your shit just swivels around your neck.
We think about your head is like the 

1770
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:51,010
worst thing you could ever hit.
This thing is barely connected.

1771
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,250
All wobbly and shit.
The bones are.

1772
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,680
There's like little stacks of boston on 
a big bone.

1773
01:14:56,770 --> 01:15:00,340
It's not like a big ass thighbone that 
connects my fucking head to my neck.

1774
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:01,253
Yeah.
Like what's wrong with this shitty 

1775
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:02,644
vertebrae?
Stuff with gooey gel in between pieces 

1776
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:07,470
of bone.
What?

1777
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,390
What a shit idea.
Whose plan is this?

1778
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,313
I made this.

1779
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:14,250
I've been knocked unconscious a couple 
of times now that I think about it.

1780
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:15,923
I've talked about this at one time.
How many concussions as normal and I 

1781
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:21,180
think I've had like 10 concussions.
That's not normal.

1782
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:23,760
That's a lot.
But at least seven.

1783
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:29,290
I probably have a bunch that I was in 
denial about because like inspiring,

1784
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,270
like you would get hit in the head all 
the time.

1785
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:37,990
Yo jay me bring it the b,
I'm sparring.

1786
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:42,230
You get hit in the head all the time.
Sometimes you get rocked and if you.

1787
01:15:42,231 --> 01:15:46,040
If you're sparring and you get rocked,
like what does constitute a concussion?

1788
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:46,933
You know,
sometimes people have concussions and 

1789
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,340
they didn't even have a bad sparring 
day.

1790
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,920
They go home and then they,
they start throwing up.

1791
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:51,960
Do

1792
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:52,793
they feel weird?
They go to the doctor and dr goodyear 

1793
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:56,190
can cost and they don't even remember 
the shot.

1794
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,030
They don't even remember what got them.
Oh,

1795
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:59,880
thank you for whatever reason.
Thank you sir.

1796
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:03,150
The um,
for whatever reason,

1797
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:05,460
you know,
that can happen to you.

1798
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:07,830
I threw up when I got a concussion.
Did you?

1799
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,090
That's super common.
Right?

1800
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:09,961
Cheers.
Cheers.

1801
01:16:09,961 --> 01:16:11,310
Cheers.
I'm,

1802
01:16:11,311 --> 01:16:11,821
yeah,
I threw up.

1803
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:15,210
I was in rollie massimino basketball 
camp and I got knocked unconscious.

1804
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:16,063
I want to for rebound.
They pulled my feet out and I landed on 

1805
01:16:18,391 --> 01:16:19,890
my head.
I was like 13.

1806
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:25,470
I had to go to the to go to the general 
hospital and I was in a wheelchair.

1807
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,150
They wouldn't let me get out of the 
wheelchair and walk.

1808
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,620
And I was like,
I'm fine.

1809
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:30,420
And I was just a little low and then all
loopy.

1810
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,250
And then I just started throwing up and 
I was like,

1811
01:16:32,251 --> 01:16:33,084
I'm not sick.

1812
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,160
I don't know why I'm throwing up.
So.

1813
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,200
Whoa.
Yeah.

1814
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:41,760
You don't want to ever admit that you're
fucked up when you hit your head dudes.

1815
01:16:41,761 --> 01:16:42,594
Like,
I'm fun.

1816
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,060
I'm fun.
By the way.

1817
01:16:45,061 --> 01:16:45,894
My parents did.
I don't even know if my parents called 

1818
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:49,440
me.
LiKe I look back at that and I wonder if

1819
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:51,480
they,
like as a parent of a 12 year old,

1820
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:55,470
I would lose my shit if my kid was in 
philadelphia and she got a concussion,

1821
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,260
I'd be,
I'd be on a fucking plane tomorrow.

1822
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:59,483
We'll also,
when someone gets a concussIon like 

1823
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:02,190
that,
you gotta really keep an eye on them for

1824
01:17:02,191 --> 01:17:04,330
quite a while.
They kept me up.

1825
01:17:04,331 --> 01:17:07,440
They put me in the rectory.
and why do they keep you awake?

1826
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,333
What's the logic behind that?
I don't that we kept like every hour I 

1827
01:17:10,971 --> 01:17:13,460
think is you don't want to fall asleep 
and go to sleep forever.

1828
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:17,060
I mean die while you're cheating the 
reaper.

1829
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,540
Yeah.
Or are you.

1830
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:22,430
See that's the question.
The people that died.

1831
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:23,264
I mean,
when they've died of this state of week 

1832
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:26,030
two.
Is this a just,

1833
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,320
you know what I'm saying?

1834
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:27,741
Yeah,
yeah.

1835
01:17:27,741 --> 01:17:28,574
I don't know.
I,

1836
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,230
they put me in with the priests and 
fucking.

1837
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:36,340
I know I just had a head injury.
What's it like hanging out with priests?

1838
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:41,240
Uh,
I never really enjoyed it.

1839
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:46,880
I just hung out with a lot of priests to
really know.

1840
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:51,140
I raised my eyebrows.
Anything eLse?

1841
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,130
You know,
it's so funny.

1842
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:54,020
I could probably get.
I'm like oblivious.

1843
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:54,854
You ever see those movies where the 
sharks in the water and the people are 

1844
01:17:56,661 --> 01:17:58,700
swimming and dance and have a good time 
and then you're like,

1845
01:17:58,730 --> 01:17:59,301
oh,
it's going to get it.

1846
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:00,590
It's gonna get it's gonna get it,
it's going to get it.

1847
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:02,120
And then they just get out there like,
hey,

1848
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,130
let's go do something else now.
And they don't get attacked.

1849
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:07,580
But I was probably like,
that was with molestation really.

1850
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:10,910
I'm certain of it really.
So it just barely missed you.

1851
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:14,980
Every time I would have been a mark like
molesters,

1852
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,010
wet dream because I was,
I was just,

1853
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,320
I don't know,
I've always attracted those people in my

1854
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,154
life to like,
people that take advantage of people I 

1855
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,370
molesters must have seen had spots on 
me.

1856
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,180
I remember watching the kid get molested
one time.

1857
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,580
Oh no.
Not,

1858
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:34,970
not like molested,
but like,

1859
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:37,040
it was definitely a,
an assault.

1860
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,420
We were in a kids camp of baptist kids 
camp and uh,

1861
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,553
I remember we were all in our bunk beds 
and it was lights out and all of a 

1862
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:47,420
sudden the lights came on and they're 
like,

1863
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,410
oh,
these two counselors,

1864
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:51,620
or like a hog tie in time and this and 
everyone's like,

1865
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:56,000
seth run and this one kid.
I mean they just came down to the bronx.

1866
01:18:56,001 --> 01:18:56,834
I had no idea what's going on.
It's one kid came running and they 

1867
01:18:58,761 --> 01:18:59,594
grabbed him and they flipped him over 
that rope and they hog tied him and 

1868
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:05,630
ripped his underwear off him and then 
brought him into the shower.

1869
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,480
And we all went into the shower and then
they had him in the shower and they were

1870
01:19:08,481 --> 01:19:09,530
like,
what are you going to do?

1871
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,593
And then like it was fucking creepy,
like they didn't touch his dick or 

1872
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:14,630
fingers,
bottle or anything,

1873
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,490
but just the fact that he was tied up 
and like,

1874
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,900
like thrown them in the shower and threw
him in the shower.

1875
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,280
And I was like,
I remember going,

1876
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:23,323
jesus christ,
note to self hide when they say hog 

1877
01:19:24,651 --> 01:19:27,110
tying.
I went to camp.

1878
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,400
By the way,
the same guy,

1879
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,100
those same two guys that did that to him
taught me archery.

1880
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,043
Oh

1881
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,433
savages.
I went to camp with these kids had tied 

1882
01:19:35,241 --> 01:19:36,074
this kid up.
They tied this kid up in his bed and 

1883
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,153
they took his bunk is a little cot cot.
They carried it out and he woke up as 

1884
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:42,404
they were taking them outside,
it was pitch black outside to pitch 

1885
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:48,800
black and you couldn't see a fucking 
inch in front of your face.

1886
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,670
And They took this kid deep in the woods
with a.

1887
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:54,570
It gets yellow and put me back,
put me back.

1888
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,790
They covered all of this shit with 
toothpaste,

1889
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:57,624
apparently toothpaste,
at least some toothpaste does not wash 

1890
01:19:59,821 --> 01:20:01,260
out of your clothes.
Really?

1891
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:02,094
Yeah.
Or if it does take a tremendous effort 

1892
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,250
so that this guy squirt toothpaste all 
over this guy's and rubbed it in

1893
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,160
this fucking piece of shit.
Oh fuck.

1894
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,380
Kids away from their parents for the 
first time.

1895
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:14,363
And it was just a few weird counselors.
I remember I had this conversation with 

1896
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:19,360
his counselor,
you know,

1897
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,270
or I guess what do you call him?
Boy scout leaders,

1898
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,730
a scout leader.
He's like an eagle scout and the kid was

1899
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:26,090
a 18,
which is like the last year that you can

1900
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,430
be a boy scout,
you know,

1901
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,950
and he and I were hanging out and uh,
he was uh,

1902
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:35,370
talking to me about all his time in the 
boy scouts and all the things he learned

1903
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:38,070
about the boys and now they're,
they're kind of kicking them out because

1904
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:40,260
you can't be in the boy scouts.
You're a fucking boy.

1905
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:41,094
Loser.

1906
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:46,070
Boy scouts are weird that way.
And I started to realize like,

1907
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,690
this is due at the end of his career,
like it's over for you.

1908
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:50,040
Your,
your eagle scout.

1909
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:53,370
You peak two peaks at 18.
Oh,

1910
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,440
put.
This was a huge part of his life.

1911
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,693
I mean,
he had all these merit badges and shit 

1912
01:20:57,871 --> 01:20:59,580
all over his clothes.
And they were telling him,

1913
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:01,360
sOn,
you got to fucking stop you gotta.

1914
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,213
Stop with your fantasy worlds.
Whether your badges and your fucking 

1915
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,650
ropes around your shoulder.
Those ropes of those little,

1916
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:08,543
uh,
I don't know.

1917
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:09,653
Lockton's reps don't.
They have those little ropes with the 

1918
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:13,920
flux,
that rope all about.

1919
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:16,120
What are you doing there?
I would have definitely got melissa if I

1920
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,960
was the boy scouts.
There was an article I wrote.

1921
01:21:18,961 --> 01:21:20,940
It's funny how you read things,
not wrote,

1922
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:21,774
read rather.
It's funny how you read things when 

1923
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:24,240
you're a little kid.

1924
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,463
Like,
I think I was maybe beef maybe 14 or 15 

1925
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:28,284
when I read this.
Some guy wrote it in the school 

1926
01:21:30,031 --> 01:21:34,500
newspaper in newton south high school.
So it was talking about the,

1927
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,473
the,
the things that they make you say when 

1928
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:39,540
you're a boy scout.
I promised to be trustworthy,

1929
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:41,370
loyal blade,
brave,

1930
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,260
clean and reverent or something like 
that.

1931
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,270
Yeah,
I think that'S the honest,

1932
01:21:45,271 --> 01:21:46,350
trustworthy,
loyal,

1933
01:21:46,351 --> 01:21:47,790
brave,
clean and reverent.

1934
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:50,730
I think those are the commandments.
if I remember correctly,

1935
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:51,564
maybe there's more of that,
but there was describing them and they 

1936
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,163
were just describing keeping your 
thoughts clean and this guy who who 

1937
01:21:58,621 --> 01:22:00,060
wrote an article was another high school
kid.

1938
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,280
It's really,
really good point.

1939
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,120
He's like,
my mind is my.

1940
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:05,963
I can have whatever thoughts I want.
Like as long as I don't do anything 

1941
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:09,930
about them.
Like why?

1942
01:22:09,931 --> 01:22:11,850
Why should you try to control my 
thoughts?

1943
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,760
And like he's right,
he's right.

1944
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:16,530
Like what is this thing clean?
Like why,

1945
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:18,240
why can't you think terrible dirty 
things?

1946
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:20,070
Because it amuses you,
you know,

1947
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:23,870
as long as you're not hurting anybody 
then what is the point like?

1948
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,240
Like I've never once thought about 
fucking a kid,

1949
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:31,320
but like are there people that are legit
think that like they must think that.

1950
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:32,963
what do you mean?
They think that like I don't have to 

1951
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:37,830
control my thoughts was absolutely 
people that are attracted to children.

1952
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:42,900
And then,
so obviously there is something to blame

1953
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:47,250
anyone that does that to a child,
but how then do you stop their brains?

1954
01:22:47,251 --> 01:22:49,770
That's what the brain's doing.
They're not doing it on purpose,

1955
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:50,604
but their brains going.
That's the real debate when it comes to 

1956
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:58,260
like when neuroscientists try to analyze
different types of behavior,

1957
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,430
destructive behaviors,
um,

1958
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,433
what,
when you can look at any type of 

1959
01:23:03,031 --> 01:23:06,250
horrible destructive behavior,
you,

1960
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:10,300
you get to that one where you literally 
don't even want to help them.

1961
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:11,403
And that's the one you were gambling and
alcoholism and even being prone to 

1962
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:20,470
violence and are the different things.
There's all sorts of different therapies

1963
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:23,860
and different ways that people would try
to move you away from that.

1964
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:24,694
But I got to imagine there's very few 
therapies that anybody wants to invest 

1965
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:31,720
in to try to get someone to stop fucking
kids.

1966
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:32,843
Yeah.
Now just like we don't have any 

1967
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:34,660
tolerance for that at all.

1968
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,273
And,
and I mean this is a really volatile 

1969
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:41,080
question to say,
but is it their fault?

1970
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,503
Well,
it's a real good question and it's so 

1971
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:46,150
easy to say,
of course it is.

1972
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:47,210
Fuck them.
You're,

1973
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,270
you're having sex with kids,
you piece of shit.

1974
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,133
It's so easy to say that,
and in a way you're right for saying 

1975
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:53,194
that you're right for thinking that 
because you're angry because what 

1976
01:23:55,151 --> 01:23:57,040
they're doing is terrible.
They're ruining lives.

1977
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,353
We all know that,
but I think human beings are just a 

1978
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:02,224
combination of experiences and genetics 
and environment and all the data that 

1979
01:24:05,831 --> 01:24:10,330
comes into them and the decisions that 
you make based on all those things.

1980
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:11,164
They're not even like your.
Your life experience is way different 

1981
01:24:13,301 --> 01:24:14,134
than my life experience and I don't know
what happened to him when he was a baby 

1982
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:21,530
that Made him this monster,
this 45 year old guy who wants to.

1983
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:22,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

1984
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,220
Like jared,
I don't know.

1985
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:28,810
I don't know what happened to him.
You know who the fuck knows what torture

1986
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:30,790
he endured when he was young?
I don't know.

1987
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:34,410
You never know.
Maybe he's just a bad person that could.

1988
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:36,310
That's a possibility too.
I'm not discounting that,

1989
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:37,773
but what is it about that one thing in 
particular that we don't have any faith 

1990
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:48,310
whatsoever that you can ever completely 
get it out of your system?

1991
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:49,530
Well,
you never could.

1992
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,210
It will be like curing.
Try to cure him.

1993
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:52,620
Crew me from being straight.

1994
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:55,900
You say that right?
But isn't that crazy that,

1995
01:24:55,901 --> 01:24:59,750
that there's no biological imperative.
They're like,

1996
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:04,320
there's no biological pole to have sex 
with little kids.

1997
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:07,430
Right?
That's just a crazy fucked up reversion.

1998
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,780
It's not like saying you could never be 
with a woman again.

1999
01:25:09,781 --> 01:25:11,640
You can never feel a woman's touch 
again.

2000
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,750
It's more like saying you can't gamble 
again or more like saying,

2001
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:16,773
oh,
the campbell campbell's that there's 

2002
01:25:17,941 --> 01:25:18,774
something like a crazy perverted sexual 
attraction connection that they're 

2003
01:25:22,981 --> 01:25:25,800
having with people that they shouldn't 
like young people.

2004
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:28,050
Right?
Where's that coming from?

2005
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,093
and if it's coming from them being 
victimized and that's what a lot of it 

2006
01:25:31,351 --> 01:25:32,184
is a lot of is coming from them being 
victimized when they're young and they 

2007
01:25:35,041 --> 01:25:40,041
in turn start victimizing other people.
It's tHe most common form of um,

2008
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:43,223
how they think.
Pedophilia actually travels back and 

2009
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:49,140
forth almost like a disease.
It's really fucked up.

2010
01:25:49,141 --> 01:25:49,974
It's like a disease of the mind,
like you could give it to somebody and 

2011
01:25:52,921 --> 01:25:55,020
fuck with their sexuality.
If you think about it,

2012
01:25:55,021 --> 01:25:58,550
if you read less to ken,
if you molest kids and you.

2013
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,910
If you look at all these guys that wind 
up being the lesters,

2014
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:04,340
a lot of them were molested as kids.
It's horrible

2015
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,173
man,
so and obviously a lot of them don't do 

2016
01:26:07,431 --> 01:26:08,264
that and don't have the urge to do that,
but there's something that happens to 

2017
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:11,654
some of them where it becomes this 
really fucked up thing that just keeps 

2018
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:18,800
passing on from person to person,
from victim to victim,

2019
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:20,263
which is a horrible stigmatization if 
you've been molested because you assume 

2020
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:25,910
if you tell people that everyone thinks 
you're going to be molesting kids,

2021
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,583
what a weird thing it must be.
To have that impulse to an impulse that 

2022
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:33,284
you know is hoRrible.
I'm so glad I don't have that because I 

2023
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:39,230
cannot control my brain.
I definitely cannot.

2024
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,380
I definitely think massively horrible 
fucking thoughts,

2025
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:46,190
but that has never crept in there.
To the point where I think,

2026
01:26:46,191 --> 01:26:50,440
I can't imagine what draw it is to what 
I,

2027
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,413
the,
the,

2028
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:55,500
the withdrawal would be to be with the 
child does not draw.

2029
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,440
There's something broken.
Men,

2030
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:00,470
some crazy disconnect in your mind.
I mean,

2031
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:04,070
I look at sexuality and I look at.
I would like to be with someone.

2032
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:05,723
I would like to share a moment with 
someone accomplished that knows what 

2033
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:12,230
they're doing and I would hate to 
instruct someone.

2034
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:14,480
I would never want to sleep.
I don't even say that you say that,

2035
01:27:14,481 --> 01:27:16,490
but do you remember that movie?
Um,

2036
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:17,840
10 with bo.
Derek?

2037
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:19,220
Yeah.
Pretty hot,

2038
01:27:19,221 --> 01:27:19,990
right?
Yeah.

2039
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:21,280
Okay.
Imagine bo,

2040
01:27:21,281 --> 01:27:22,700
derek,
and uh,

2041
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:23,563
for whatever reason she's been an island
for the first 24 years of her life that 

2042
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:28,063
she's never seen a man.
And finally you and her meat and you're 

2043
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:34,190
hanging out and it's going to be the 
night,

2044
01:27:34,191 --> 01:27:36,560
which she doesn't know what to do.
I think you fucking help her out.

2045
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:37,783
I definitely,
I can show her the way and I definitely 

2046
01:27:39,321 --> 01:27:41,600
tell her a bunch of how it works.

2047
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:41,871
Like,
hey,

2048
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:43,580
when I'm done to,
oh my god,

2049
01:27:43,581 --> 01:27:47,180
look at that.
She's so pretty with.

2050
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:48,530
Interesting.
Is that that book?

2051
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:50,990
Lolita.
What is that book?

2052
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:51,993
I don't know.
I read it.

2053
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,590
I want to say.
I don't know.

2054
01:27:54,591 --> 01:27:56,690
I read it.
I think I read it in russian.

2055
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:57,711
Oh,
no,

2056
01:27:57,711 --> 01:27:58,910
west,
swear to god.

2057
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,620
Can you speak fluent russian?
No,

2058
01:28:00,621 --> 01:28:02,600
I can understand russian though.
Wow.

2059
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:06,280
Now how much can you read a nun anymore?
You used to be able to.

2060
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,580
Yeah,
I used to because of the.

2061
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:08,443
Because the.
It's a different alphabet and I can't 

2062
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:10,934
read it at all anymore and I thought it 
would be able to pick it up a little 

2063
01:28:12,441 --> 01:28:14,330
bit.
I have a diary written in russian.

2064
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:15,973
Yeah,
when I was backpacking through europe 

2065
01:28:17,151 --> 01:28:19,280
because we were all traveling together 
after Russia.

2066
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,473
I started keeping a journal and I was 
just writing in russian because I was 

2067
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:24,580
like,
no one can because no,

2068
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:25,100
I could be wrong.

2069
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:25,933
The train and I could write whatever I 
want and no one could really read my 

2070
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:31,950
read what I wrote.
It was a very simple journal like it was

2071
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:35,030
today.
Eats meats.

2072
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:38,190
I like riding bikes.
Yeah,

2073
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,240
man.
You're a those kinds of life experiences

2074
01:28:41,241 --> 01:28:42,074
or just to go into the place where they 
write those things and learn how to 

2075
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,473
write in that language and write your 
own little blog and speak with those 

2076
01:28:50,841 --> 01:28:53,540
people in there.
That's a crazy life experience,

2077
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:54,220
man.
That's.

2078
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:56,540
That's very enriching.
I've been telling.

2079
01:28:56,541 --> 01:29:01,541
I've been telling this story on stage 
now of riding in in Vietnam through rice

2080
01:29:04,201 --> 01:29:07,140
patties.
How well when I called you on the phone.

2081
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:09,870
Yeah,
that's a great story because we had been

2082
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:10,883
drinking and smoking hash and I was 
riding the motorcycles and you called 

2083
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:16,560
and I was listening to music and it 
snapped me into reality and you're like,

2084
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:17,010
what are you doing?

2085
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:17,940
And I told you,
and you're like,

2086
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:19,410
dude,
this fucking bert.

2087
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,490
This is what it's about you.
Like it was a very.

2088
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:22,403
It was a very pivotal speech and the way
I looked at that show because you're 

2089
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,820
like,
you like these experiences,

2090
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,833
fuck the show these experience define 
you and you need to talk about this on 

2091
01:29:31,121 --> 01:29:34,020
stage.
You like literally think about,

2092
01:29:34,021 --> 01:29:34,854
look around,
remember your surroundings and bring 

2093
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:37,680
this up on stage.
And I was like,

2094
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,330
I will,
and then I was like,

2095
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:40,164
fuck yeah.
And the sun was setting and it was 

2096
01:29:41,941 --> 01:29:42,774
fucking beautiful and there's oxygens in
the rice patties and there's birds and 

2097
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:46,794
I'm listening to spirit and spanish 
caravan by the doors and I'm flying and 

2098
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:52,950
now and now I just had this conversation
with you and I'm looking at my shadow in

2099
01:29:52,951 --> 01:29:55,410
front of me racing me and that's my 
childhood and that's my,

2100
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:55,890
my.

2101
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,610
And I'm like,
oh,

2102
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:58,260
it's the greatest thing ever.
It was like.

2103
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:00,690
And then my wife called,
oh wow.

2104
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:01,710
It's like,
it works so well with joe.

2105
01:30:01,711 --> 01:30:02,910
We'll try it with her.
And she was like,

2106
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,850
get off the fucking bike.
Well you have high blood pressure.

2107
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:06,860
But uh,
but yeah,

2108
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:10,500
but like that's the hardest part is 
telling these stories on stage two.

2109
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:13,620
Totally different reactions.
Be great if she coached you on,

2110
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:16,260
right on bertha,
conquer you are the machine.

2111
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:20,370
She screams at you.
I got,

2112
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:21,420
I got the audio.
I told her that.

2113
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:22,254
Jay oakerson.
It's so funny because they're like 

2114
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,560
rogan's your spirit.
Like it was a great.

2115
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,753
I've got the audio.
I was going to post it and have someone 

2116
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:30,780
do a animate it,
but yeah,

2117
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:31,614
there was.
I'm trying to write about those 

2118
01:30:33,121 --> 01:30:36,420
experiences now on this new hour and 
it's just,

2119
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:38,070
it's really fun,
but you know what man,

2120
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,173
you,
when you told me to tell them machines 

2121
01:30:41,841 --> 01:30:44,190
story on stage,
I learned so much about this,

2122
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:47,340
about the art of storytelling and the 
art of stand up mess together.

2123
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:52,020
The hardest part is that I remember that
how long it took to get that story good.

2124
01:30:52,021 --> 01:30:52,854
And every story starts with like only 
one little funny part and you just got 

2125
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:57,284
to do it all the fucking time.
You just got to figure it out and work 

2126
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:03,330
it out and needed out and tell it as 
many times as you can.

2127
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:04,343
Yeah.
It's like you've got to figure out what 

2128
01:31:05,821 --> 01:31:06,654
to cut out to.
Maybe a better way to describe what was 

2129
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:10,680
happening.
You know,

2130
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:12,660
it's um,
there's an art to it.

2131
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,490
Some people are just geniuses at it.
Yeah.

2132
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:16,120
Some people that tell story and you just
go,

2133
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:18,660
you just can't wait.
Can't wait to hear what happens next.

2134
01:31:18,661 --> 01:31:21,180
Some people,
it's their pacing to joey diaz will slow

2135
01:31:21,181 --> 01:31:22,860
everything down.
Dog,

2136
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:27,600
let me tell you somethIng.
Nineteen 86 north bergen,

2137
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:31,680
New Jersey is me and peter ham sandwich 
and it'll go into this.

2138
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,161
Fuck.
I mean,

2139
01:31:32,161 --> 01:31:35,040
it's like you like you're a little kid 
like gimme the popcorn.

2140
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:37,500
His father always carried a comb in his 
back pocket.

2141
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,650
He called him out with hiS campaign.
He comb his hair.

2142
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:42,423
You remember those columns used to have 
with the little pointy things would 

2143
01:31:45,301 --> 01:31:49,950
break off and you'd only have like two 
fangs and then you'd be missing a fang.

2144
01:31:49,951 --> 01:31:54,390
they'd have the other thing kind of like
move your hair out with it.

2145
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:55,980
Wow.
The fucking part where it doesn't work.

2146
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:57,600
The thing I was telling,
I was telling steve,

2147
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:58,434
oh,

2148
01:31:58,490 --> 01:31:59,323
I just had steve all mY podcast and we 
were talking about the being being in 

2149
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,590
comedy and being at the clubs.
The thing of it iS,

2150
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:06,723
is that often the funniest thing you say
you don't realize you're being funny 

2151
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,620
sometimes,
right?

2152
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:12,300
Yeah.
And,

2153
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,020
and we try have your friends around and 
be like,

2154
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:15,880
hey,

2155
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:16,780
And you're like,
no,

2156
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,410
I feel silly for saying it.
Like,

2157
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,330
no,
that's good.

2158
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,960
Like joey that and that is what's great 
about joey.

2159
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:23,883
I swear to god when I say I have been 
with him where he said the funniest 

2160
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:28,684
things that no one could write.
You'll never be able to find this 

2161
01:32:32,021 --> 01:32:33,300
structure and write it.
Yeah.

2162
01:32:33,301 --> 01:32:34,600
I'll take another one too.
Thanks jamie.

2163
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,780
And uh,
and you just like,

2164
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:38,123
like,
like he said on my podcast wanted 

2165
01:32:39,251 --> 01:32:40,084
autonomy.

2166
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:43,150
my have a big dog is a dog and old trust
dogs.

2167
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:44,241
I said,
why?

2168
01:32:44,241 --> 01:32:45,540
And he goes,
procrastinate.

2169
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:49,990
When I first came to this country,
I get attacked by dogs five times.

2170
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,900
The last dog walks past me and then came
back to bite me.

2171
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:55,480
And you're like,
what the fuck man,

2172
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:56,580
like,
like,

2173
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,840
and then,
and he just has a flat look on his face.

2174
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:01,240
He's not trying to run a bit.
He's tellIng you his life.

2175
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,360
Yeah.
He's just funny joe.

2176
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:07,540
he just know how to do it.
I told them I was a guy,

2177
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:11,470
cool guy that live near to best when 
there's homeless people were breaking in

2178
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:12,850
my house.
Joe drove by every night.

2179
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,040
How many homeless people broke in your 
house?

2180
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,770
Really?
Because we're under construction.

2181
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:22,830
We're renovating a first one broke in a 
brumby's.

2182
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:27,800
Very fucking similar.

2183
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:32,580
You can't scare them.
Really?

2184
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:33,570
Yeah.
I was sitting.

2185
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:35,790
I.
We had dinner at my sister's house.

2186
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,550
the girls went inside.
Everything's under construction.

2187
01:33:38,551 --> 01:33:39,384
We got like a big dumpster out front.
It looks like it's under construction 

2188
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,073
and I'm sitting off to the side smoking 
a cigar in the darkness and this girl 

2189
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:49,590
just starts walking in,
walking up the driveway,

2190
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,990
starts to go into our backyard and I see
her and I'm like,

2191
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:52,740
wait,
do I know?

2192
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,573
I must know her.
It's a weirD thing when you get robbed 

2193
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:55,913
that you're like,
it's like a such a confrontation that 

2194
01:33:57,391 --> 01:33:58,224
you're like,
like if you ever been like been in 

2195
01:34:00,391 --> 01:34:01,500
competition and someone's like,
hey man.

2196
01:34:01,501 --> 01:34:02,251
And you're lIke,
oh,

2197
01:34:02,251 --> 01:34:03,084
I must have this person high.
And then they attack you and you're 

2198
01:34:04,081 --> 01:34:04,914
like,
oh fuck.

2199
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,910
This is how it starts.

2200
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:09,990
That was what happened in this growth is
just going back here.

2201
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:11,850
And I go and we must know her and I go,
hey,

2202
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,410
can I help you?
And then she was like,

2203
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:15,660
oh hey.
And she said something like,

2204
01:34:15,661 --> 01:34:20,661
I work for the dwp or some child's 
organization something.

2205
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:21,541
And I was like,
no,

2206
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:22,560
this is,
this is,

2207
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:27,150
you're breaking into my backyard.
and I start fucking shouting at her.

2208
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:30,870
And she just keeps walking towards me.
She's not fucking scared at all.

2209
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:31,823
Priscilla is 130 pound bull mastiff.
A beast of a fucking dog is going at 

2210
01:34:36,631 --> 01:34:38,820
her,
like leaping at her and all this.

2211
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:39,654
Keeping up as a little tiny dog fence 
that we had in our front yard at the 

2212
01:34:41,821 --> 01:34:44,760
time.
Fearless this woman was.

2213
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:48,090
You couldn't shake her hair.
I think a heroin addict probably.

2214
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,150
Yeah.
And I was like,

2215
01:34:51,151 --> 01:34:52,380
motherfuckers,
we call the cops.

2216
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:54,660
Then the cops show up.
I don't remember when shit's on crops.

2217
01:34:54,661 --> 01:34:56,460
I love them.
They showed up in three minutes.

2218
01:34:56,461 --> 01:34:58,040
They were there three minutes.
The woman

2219
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,850
had already taken off.
I told them where they were.

2220
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,730
she went and the guy was like,
yeah,

2221
01:35:01,731 --> 01:35:02,421
it's,
you know,

2222
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:06,410
there's a new heroin dealer in town.
A lot of junkies and homeless people are

2223
01:35:06,411 --> 01:35:08,780
going to be loitering around here until 
we stopped that,

2224
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:09,951
but he's like,
I'm sorrY.

2225
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:12,080
And I look at both my daughters are in 
the,

2226
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:13,293
um,
in the doorway and they're looking out 

2227
01:35:14,691 --> 01:35:15,524
and I'm like,
hey man,

2228
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:16,513
I told the cop,
so do you mind if the girls come down 

2229
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:21,200
for like two seconds and you just let 
them know that they'll be like,

2230
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:23,000
you're going to,
there's nothing to worry about.

2231
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:23,480
And he's like,
yeah,

2232
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,313
I don't know your girls going down.
So george and I'll come down and they 

2233
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:29,420
had lollipops and they put notes on it 
that said,

2234
01:35:29,421 --> 01:35:31,880
you are our heroes.
And they gave him to the cops.

2235
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:33,800
I'm only talking about a heart fucking 
breaking moment.

2236
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:35,780
These costs were like,
ladies,

2237
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:37,093
first of all,
we will be circling this bark all night 

2238
01:35:38,601 --> 01:35:39,920
long.
Nothing's happened to his house.

2239
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:40,873
We will keep an extra good.
I out in this house and Georgia starts 

2240
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:44,120
pulling on my shirt.
She's like,

2241
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:45,110
dad,
let's go dad.

2242
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:46,250
Let's go.
I was like,

2243
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:47,330
hold on george.
He's not done.

2244
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,290
He's like,
dad,

2245
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:49,260
dad,
I think we,

2246
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:51,080
we should go to the house.
And I was like,

2247
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:51,943
Georgia,
it's fine by the guy gives a speech and 

2248
01:35:53,631 --> 01:35:56,300
we walked back to the house and I was 
wearing this shirt and she goes,

2249
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:58,370
you are wearing a marijuana shirt.

2250
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:02,930
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2251
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:05,150
cops don't give a fuck.
No,

2252
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,630
I don't give a fuck about pot.
They want more people on pot.

2253
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:11,010
Nobody just relax.
But it was bringing the homeless people.

2254
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:14,330
We had a porta potty in our front yard.
Do you know anybody that's ever shot the

2255
01:36:14,331 --> 01:36:18,980
heroine actually shot him.
That's what hedberg used to do.

2256
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:21,710
Yeah.
I didn't know him well though.

2257
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,180
I mean that was when,
um,

2258
01:36:23,181 --> 01:36:24,830
you know,
he had gotten gang green.

2259
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,650
Um,
and like I think it was 2003,

2260
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:28,484
stan hope pulled me aside to tell me 
that he was in the hospital and then 

2261
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:34,123
hedberg is like,
his leg was really fucked up and they 

2262
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:36,344
were worried he was gonna lose his leg 
because he had gangrene from shooting 

2263
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,620
the same spot.
And.

2264
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:44,120
But I didn't know him well,
he was more of a friend to stan hope,

2265
01:36:44,121 --> 01:36:47,230
but as a comic I was a huge fan.
Well,

2266
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:50,640
as a person I was a huge fan of his.
But as a comic I really respected him.

2267
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:52,360
He was a great comic.
Yeah,

2268
01:36:52,361 --> 01:36:56,450
just interesting to and really unique 
and he just always made me laugh.

2269
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:59,180
I just really.
And I always enjoyed like his,

2270
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:03,290
his,
like headed such an observed style.

2271
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:06,410
It made giggly.
It was so unique.

2272
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,210
Yeah.
But he liked that heroin,

2273
01:37:08,211 --> 01:37:08,830
I guess.

2274
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:12,560
Do you hear the reference a stan hope 
made a,

2275
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:15,550
a machete referenced last night?
No,

2276
01:37:15,551 --> 01:37:16,384
I didn't hear it.
Do frane party of three to frame party 

2277
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:20,800
of three.
What happened to the do friends?

2278
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:25,180
I said we started a search party.
Search party of four.

2279
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:26,550
Yeah.
He,

2280
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,600
his,
his pacing and his,

2281
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:32,890
his style of talking.
It was the first comic that I ever heard

2282
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,720
say ain't.
And it was,

2283
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,520
it was poetic,
you know,

2284
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:38,980
man,
I ain't even gonna do that.

2285
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:40,500
Yeah,
he,

2286
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,550
he had it down.
I would watch.

2287
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:44,860
I would pay right now.
I'm not even joking.

2288
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:47,380
If you said to me,
I have a,

2289
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:49,270
a like a 30 for 30,
you know,

2290
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:54,220
30 years 30 for 30 about mitch hedberg,
that's an hour and 20 minutes.

2291
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:56,040
That covers all the,

2292
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,970
all the I'd pay easily a thousand 
dollars to watch it.

2293
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:01,500
Wow.
Strong words.

2294
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,620
I would.
I'm men it,

2295
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:06,480
I find I should.
Interesting me too.

2296
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:09,420
I wanted to do a series for comedy 
central where we had like a,

2297
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:10,254
almost like a podcast,
but we were where I would go to all the 

2298
01:38:12,301 --> 01:38:15,680
comics and I would have them tell me 
their best story,

2299
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,553
their best hedberg story and then I'll 
compile it all into episodes about 

2300
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,620
comics telling stories about a tell 
comics,

2301
01:38:22,621 --> 01:38:24,930
telling the stories about mitch thomas,
telling stories about stan hope.

2302
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,330
Like imagine if you did one with stan 
hope and I just.

2303
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,313
Everyone I had on my podcast,
I just took like five minutes aside and 

2304
01:38:30,121 --> 01:38:30,954
was like,
tell me your best doug stan hope story 

2305
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:34,710
and then I just compiled that into a 
three hour podcast.

2306
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:39,150
We let doug listen to it and then at the
end of the story go objection.

2307
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:42,630
That'd be a bad ass.
It would be bad ass.

2308
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:47,700
Maybe I'll do that about stan hope.
It's not a bad one.

2309
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:52,620
I got a gang of stories.
I'm sure he's always been a character.

2310
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:55,230
I told stan hope story to marilyn manson
last night.

2311
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,153
Did you?
YeAh.

2312
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:56,701
Well I think.
Oh,

2313
01:38:56,701 --> 01:38:57,534
I got to take that back.
I told her on stage isn't weird hanging 

2314
01:38:59,251 --> 01:39:01,470
out with marilyn manson.
Very fucking bizarre.

2315
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:02,363
It was odd.
I shook his hand in the process of 

2316
01:39:04,261 --> 01:39:05,040
shaking his hand.
I was like,

2317
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,180
oh shit.
That's marilyn manson.

2318
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,433
I walked into doug's like manson's in 
there and I didn't think there was like 

2319
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:13,530
I was thinking of a guy from bubba,
the love sponge or something.

2320
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,640
Oh,
okay.

2321
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:15,630
And I was like,
okay.

2322
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,040
And then we walked in and I went,
oh,

2323
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:20,220
that's marilyn manson.
And I just like super easy to talk to.

2324
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,030
Really smart fucking dude.
You know?

2325
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:24,060
He's a really good artIst.

2326
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:25,250
Ever.
See his work does work.

2327
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,990
I bought,
I went to work at barnes and noble.

2328
01:39:27,991 --> 01:39:31,800
His book came out a book and I was just,
I was like,

2329
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,450
he was from Florida.
I was from Florida,

2330
01:39:33,451 --> 01:39:36,180
so I read the book.
It's fucking really interesting.

2331
01:39:36,181 --> 01:39:39,630
It's an interesting way to write a book,
like a comic should do what he did.

2332
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:40,853
He had a gallery,
a opening or showing of his work and I 

2333
01:39:45,391 --> 01:39:47,460
went to check it out.
It's really interesting.

2334
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:49,590
I mean,
he's super creative guy,

2335
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:50,633
very creative,
so you can kind of see how it look at 

2336
01:39:53,161 --> 01:39:54,330
that.
I mean that's really good.

2337
01:39:54,331 --> 01:39:57,030
Stuff like that.
That's beautiful art.

2338
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:57,691
Yeah.
No,

2339
01:39:57,691 --> 01:40:00,540
he's a really good.
it's bizarre,

2340
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,880
weird shit like that.
A hunter s thompson when he's got there,

2341
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:03,901
he's got.
Look at that.

2342
01:40:03,901 --> 01:40:04,734
The one to the left that the hunter s 
thompson one look at that is fucking 

2343
01:40:06,901 --> 01:40:07,470
great.

2344
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:09,180
He did it.
He did a video.

2345
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:12,710
He did a video the these gesture day 
about um,

2346
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:18,290
about cutting a donald trump's head off.
Do you think he sells that as a far as I

2347
01:40:19,021 --> 01:40:22,050
know he did a video about cutting donald
trump's hat off and that is,

2348
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:27,030
that is not going to fare well now.
Think that'S illegal now.

2349
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,370
Like once when someone's,
the president,

2350
01:40:29,371 --> 01:40:31,620
I don't think you can make jokes about 
killing and cut their heads off.

2351
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:33,180
And then I was like,
oh,

2352
01:40:33,181 --> 01:40:34,590
I made a video too.
It's a little different.

2353
01:40:34,591 --> 01:40:37,680
And I showed him mine and it's me and a 
thong coming out of a porta potty.

2354
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:40,380
I saw tHat and he was like,
he goes,

2355
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,401
yeah.
He laughed.

2356
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:41,851
He was like,
oh,

2357
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:43,200
that's funny.
That'S was really funny.

2358
01:40:43,201 --> 01:40:44,160
And I was like,
well,

2359
01:40:44,161 --> 01:40:45,490
how much did it cost you to shoot your.

2360
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,540
Yeah,
yeah.

2361
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:49,373
He got a rubber head.
The Whole deal that I'm hunter s 

2362
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:54,700
thompson from manson is fucking amazing.
I wonder if they have prints of that.

2363
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:55,683
I bet you could call marilyn manson and 
asked him if he has a predator that 

2364
01:40:58,151 --> 01:40:59,620
would be annoying.
You don't.

2365
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:01,000
Not at all.
Not from you.

2366
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:02,110
It'd be annoying.
Like,

2367
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:03,280
so he called me and said,
oh,

2368
01:41:03,281 --> 01:41:05,200
I get you a dvd.
Amazon.com.

2369
01:41:05,201 --> 01:41:06,170
Stupid.
Oh yeah.

2370
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:10,090
What is that?
A thinly veiled request.

2371
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:13,830
That's why I'm not famous.
I called marilyn manson.

2372
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:14,673
He go,
do you know how I get one of your 

2373
01:41:15,341 --> 01:41:18,190
albums?
Just download it on itunes.

2374
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,800
People get mad.
Is there.

2375
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:22,390
There are some bands that you can't buy 
an itunes,

2376
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:24,790
right?
Maynard maynard scott.

2377
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:26,840
is that scott,
is that made a key mentor?

2378
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:31,890
Keenan tool is dude the fucking the tool
album with prison sex on it.

2379
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:33,830
Oh,
I love that.

2380
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:37,540
The greatest fucking album.
I love that album.

2381
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,730
Top to bottom was one of my favorite 
albums.

2382
01:41:39,731 --> 01:41:42,670
That's when I got into ecstasy and coat 
and carlo man,

2383
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:43,613
that prison sex.
I used to listen to that shit when I 

2384
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:47,950
worked out because like that was like a 
weightlifting song.

2385
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:51,220
Oh,
you get foreign sober.

2386
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:53,740
Ooh.
Good channels on that man.

2387
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:54,574
That is a great fucking album.
That was a great podcast when you had 

2388
01:41:56,801 --> 01:41:57,940
him on.
Yeah,

2389
01:41:57,941 --> 01:42:00,340
he's interesting.
He's a really interesting guy.

2390
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:03,010
He's very smart dude.
Almost too smart.

2391
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,810
Cool boots.
He's cool boots.

2392
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:07,323
Boots.

2393
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:11,530
He makes really good wine.
Yeah.

2394
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,200
Really good wine.
Like I'm not,

2395
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,730
I'm not obviously not as Somalia or 
anything like that,

2396
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:19,030
but I know like what tastes good and his
shit tastes really good and he,

2397
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:21,640
he knows so much about it.
Like we talked to them about it,

2398
01:42:21,641 --> 01:42:26,290
like the way he describes it and 
explains the process and he's super,

2399
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:27,670
super into it.
He is,

2400
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:30,190
I,
I'm fascinated by that guy.

2401
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:32,860
Him and him,
marilyn manson.

2402
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:34,000
Uh,
what was the other guy?

2403
01:42:34,001 --> 01:42:35,640
Trent reznor,
that whole.

2404
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:39,320
There was a whole genre.
Now those guys turned into a club dJ say

2405
01:42:39,321 --> 01:42:43,630
go turn into diplo or scrillex back then
they made albums.

2406
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:48,520
Well those guys may not know.
They do one song and release it and then

2407
01:42:48,521 --> 01:42:50,130
they toward.
Do you ever follow?

2408
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:51,460
You don't.
Are you on snapchat at all?

2409
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:55,000
No.
The diplo on snapchat is one of the most

2410
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,890
interesting lives a human could live.

2411
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:59,080
Really?
He is in my right.

2412
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:00,273
He is on private jets.
I met diplo a long time ago before he 

2413
01:43:02,921 --> 01:43:04,180
was,
I mean I'm sure he was famous,

2414
01:43:04,181 --> 01:43:05,014
but like he was going to a trade show 
for travel channel and we went out and 

2415
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:09,430
he was so interested in hosting.
He's like,

2416
01:43:09,431 --> 01:43:12,640
I really want to get into hosting.
Thank fucking god.

2417
01:43:12,641 --> 01:43:16,720
they didn't pick up his show.
He travelS on private jets to helsinki,

2418
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:19,270
then to tokyo,
then to ibiza.

2419
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:20,560
Then to.
I mean he's,

2420
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:24,430
when he's in,
he's in vegas once a week with skrillex.

2421
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:29,260
They do a party and like,
it's the craziest fucking life man.

2422
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:32,110
He's a super ball and he's super bawling
and he's done.

2423
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:35,350
He doesn't look like he spends a ton of 
money other than private jets.

2424
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:36,184
But,
but he seems like he's got his shit 

2425
01:43:37,481 --> 01:43:40,250
together.
He's a really sweet too.

2426
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:43,860
They do a show in vegas every week 
screaming scrillex I,

2427
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:44,960
I watched,
um,

2428
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:47,350
on,
on vice law vice land.

2429
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:50,800
What'S the tv slant?
Viceland on noisy.

2430
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:52,340
Uh,
the host

2431
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,740
who I forgot his name,
but he's a great host of noisy.

2432
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:58,850
He really is a fantastic host and I'm 
speaking from a hosting perspective,

2433
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:02,870
very laissez faire casual host.
he,

2434
01:44:02,871 --> 01:44:04,760
um,
I wish I knew his name.

2435
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:05,683
I'd give him a shout out.
He went to vegas for a weekend and 

2436
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:09,944
partied with like all those guys and 
just their lifestyle and how much money 

2437
01:44:13,551 --> 01:44:15,170
they make.
I mean they were making,

2438
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:16,110
you know,
and,

2439
01:44:16,110 --> 01:44:18,650
and then I didn't even know that dj am 
you remember that guy?

2440
01:44:18,651 --> 01:44:21,350
Who did he die?
He died of a heroin overdose or.

2441
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:25,160
But he was in the plane crash and he was
a great fucking dj,

2442
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:28,070
like a legit great dj,
and I was like,

2443
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:29,810
oh,
I just thought it was a reality star.

2444
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:30,673
I didn't know dj.
Like he went on to big boy in the 

2445
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:34,064
morning I think and did a and was the 
first person to do mashups of like run 

2446
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:41,830
dmc and sweet home Alabama.
And,

2447
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:44,750
and he was playing sweet home Alabama on
the fucking breakfast club.

2448
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:47,030
And everyone's like,
oh shit.

2449
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:50,690
It was hits the fucking.
I got really into that.

2450
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,380
That's one of my worm holes that I went 
down,

2451
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:53,253
was started googling everything about 
these djs and then I end up watching a 

2452
01:44:57,381 --> 01:45:00,710
girl doing drums.
HAve you seen these girls that do drums?

2453
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:01,910
Fucking

2454
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:02,810
baddest thing?
Well,

2455
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:06,440
isn't an interesting what shows have 
come to in vegas,

2456
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,333
like a thing used to be in vegas is you 
would go to vegas and you would see a 

2457
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:13,580
band and you still do that a lot in 
vegas,

2458
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:18,440
but more often than that you have djs 
and these djs,

2459
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:20,770
they have regular shows at these places.
Yeah,

2460
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:22,460
well they do it all the time.
Would you take,

2461
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:23,870
would you,
thiS is a silly question,

2462
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,750
would you take a um,
were you looking for.

2463
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:28,270
I was going to give you a bottle of it.
Got it,

2464
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,950
got it.
Would you take a residency somewhere?

2465
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,020
I don't think so.
I don't think that'd be as fun.

2466
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,430
What if,
what if it was in la?

2467
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:37,520
I think I'd like to do whatever the fuck
I want to do.

2468
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,840
I like doing exactly how I'm doing it 
now.

2469
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:41,030
I don't,
I don't want to do a resident.

2470
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:44,090
I don't want to be required to be in one
spot because I like,

2471
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:47,300
I'd like to schedule phoenix one 
weekend,

2472
01:45:47,301 --> 01:45:49,520
boston another weekend.
I like to do it like that.

2473
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:53,450
I don't like to do it where I have to be
somewhere every week.

2474
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:57,080
It's not a bad thing,
but if you can have freedom,

2475
01:45:57,130 --> 01:45:58,190
take freedom.
Always.

2476
01:45:58,210 --> 01:45:59,600
That's what if they said,
what if,

2477
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:04,810
what if hypothetically being bilber doug
stanhope myself,

2478
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:05,743
you fitzsimmons did once a month in 
vegas and did that show in vegas like 

2479
01:46:10,911 --> 01:46:11,850
that?
Like that?

2480
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:14,210
Wow.
Yeah,

2481
01:46:14,211 --> 01:46:15,410
they have.
I would commit to that.

2482
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:17,450
I would commit to that.
That would be so fine by the way.

2483
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:20,270
I'd definitely commit to that because I 
would be the one getting probably making

2484
01:46:20,271 --> 01:46:23,030
sure dinner was ready for everybody,
but why do we have to fly to vegas?

2485
01:46:23,031 --> 01:46:23,864
Why not do it here?
Want to do it exactly like we did last 

2486
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:26,294
night?
Yeah.

2487
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:26,900
Yeah.
See,

2488
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:28,370
don't complicate shit.
Oh yeah.

2489
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:29,001
I guess.
Yeah,

2490
01:46:29,001 --> 01:46:30,740
we're in the store.
We all live here.

2491
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:33,050
Fuck.
We're flying somewhere else.

2492
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:34,093
Good point.
Sometimes I can complicate things just 

2493
01:46:35,901 --> 01:46:38,750
because I go.
That'd be fun for us all in hotel rooms.

2494
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:40,490
When you're thinking about it having a 
reSidency,

2495
01:46:40,491 --> 01:46:42,970
you want to be like dean martin and 
sammy davis jr.

2496
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,210
New rat pack please.
Gentleman.

2497
01:46:47,211 --> 01:46:48,620
Everybody wants to be a new backpack.

2498
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:54,660
Gang gang's all here.
The bro pack ropack out bro,

2499
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,980
but doing a super show is that.
You know what?

2500
01:46:59,070 --> 01:47:01,380
Last night was like a podcast super 
show.

2501
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:03,600
Yeah.
We should definitely do that more often.

2502
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:04,434
That was so much fun.
It was like one of the most fun things 

2503
01:47:05,521 --> 01:47:06,354
I've ever done in my life.
It was so great because like when I did 

2504
01:47:08,401 --> 01:47:09,234
my 200th episode,
I did it with tom and bill in my man 

2505
01:47:10,981 --> 01:47:13,230
cave and we smoked cigars and halfway 
through I went,

2506
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,333
oh wait,
I've had the ability to do something 

2507
01:47:15,391 --> 01:47:16,224
like this all the time is having my 
friends come in together and us just 

2508
01:47:20,011 --> 01:47:23,130
hang out and drink and bullshit,
but we can do that all the time,

2509
01:47:23,131 --> 01:47:24,840
but that,
that last night was just,

2510
01:47:24,841 --> 01:47:27,270
I'll never,
I will for the next week.

2511
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,490
I'll remember moments of that and just 
giggle.

2512
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:33,030
I wish I was there for the sarah tiana 
bill burr pornography fight.

2513
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,033
Yeah.
Very bummed out that I had left when 

2514
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:38,210
that was going down.
It would've been.

2515
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,440
It was an interesting.
It was an interesting debate.

2516
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:43,620
I think it all started with condoms in 
porn.

2517
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:44,723
Yeah.
Well people get weird when it comes to 

2518
01:47:46,351 --> 01:47:47,310
watching people.
Fuck.

2519
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:49,050
Some people don't think you should be 
able to do it.

2520
01:47:49,910 --> 01:47:52,740
I'm into the weirdest shit now.
I broke my gov.

2521
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:55,510
Talk to me.
I'm fucking choking.

2522
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,391
No,
no,

2523
01:47:56,391 --> 01:47:56,700
no,
no,

2524
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,533
no,
no.

2525
01:47:57,580 --> 01:47:58,500
Uh,
I was into.

2526
01:47:59,020 --> 01:47:59,853
I got into quicksand porn for a second,
but you remember we just can't come 

2527
01:48:03,571 --> 01:48:08,571
unless the girls mascara's like covered 
with sweat from gag and tears.

2528
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:13,440
That doesn't turn me like my big.
My big thing is close up.

2529
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:16,140
Orgasms cLose up like him close up.
Yeah,

2530
01:48:16,141 --> 01:48:17,460
because that's the way I see them in 
real life.

2531
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:18,780
My wife is one of the fucked me up.

2532
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:20,760
She was like,
why was watching someone?

2533
01:48:20,761 --> 01:48:22,800
And it was like a guy in the girl's 
gagging.

2534
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:24,270
She was like,
I don't fucking gag.

2535
01:48:24,271 --> 01:48:25,320
And I was like,
no shit.

2536
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:26,950
And then she was like,
oh my god.

2537
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:28,070
And then she was like,
uh,

2538
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,700
she was like,
she's like,

2539
01:48:29,701 --> 01:48:30,534
yeah,
but that's so funny that you'd watch 

2540
01:48:30,881 --> 01:48:33,180
something that you don't even do.
And I went,

2541
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,440
what do you mean?
She was like,

2542
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:36,630
you're watching something that's total 
fantasy.

2543
01:48:36,631 --> 01:48:37,464
Like you have no attachment to that.
so it's almost like the sex you have is 

2544
01:48:40,411 --> 01:48:42,240
something totally different than what 
you masturbate too.

2545
01:48:42,241 --> 01:48:43,051
And I was like,
oh,

2546
01:48:43,051 --> 01:48:46,680
that's a good fucking call.
So I tried to really dial it in to like,

2547
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,810
what is My,
what is the,

2548
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,530
what are the things that actually turned
me on in real life and one of the things

2549
01:48:52,531 --> 01:48:54,420
is with my wife,
I have an orgasm,

2550
01:48:54,421 --> 01:48:57,870
I'm usually down there and that really 
turns me on when that happens.

2551
01:48:57,870 --> 01:48:58,860
I'm like,
oh fuck.

2552
01:48:58,861 --> 01:49:03,360
So I got really close up org.
I just got super uncomfortable.

2553
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:05,603
So does the rest of the world.
Everybody listening when jesus heard 

2554
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:12,100
there's another thing called it down 
blouses.

2555
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:13,050
Yeah.
But it's very,

2556
01:49:13,051 --> 01:49:14,310
it's very.
No,

2557
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:15,960
I'm being serious.
Typing down bro.

2558
01:49:15,961 --> 01:49:18,240
like bend over to like fix your shoe or 
something.

2559
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:19,790
You looked down her blouse and sierra 
ted's.

2560
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:23,370
It's a genre of it,
but the genre I got into,

2561
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:24,443
if you look on pornhub,
it's down bouncing and it's just girls 

2562
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:29,040
with loose fitting shirts,
cleaning,

2563
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:31,643
which is the real like that is something
that I walked into the kitchen and my 

2564
01:49:34,081 --> 01:49:38,010
wife will be like doing the dishes and 
her paJama top shirt and you'll see like

2565
01:49:38,011 --> 01:49:43,011
a side tit and you'd be like,
Well I go tigers in here.

2566
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:47,740
There's a tiger in the city.
Yeah,

2567
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,010
see,

2568
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,341
look,
look,

2569
01:49:48,341 --> 01:49:48,671
look,
look,

2570
01:49:48,671 --> 01:49:49,504
look.
This is hilarious and that's all it is 

2571
01:49:51,731 --> 01:49:52,564
is down her.
So it's like the women are working and 

2572
01:49:54,581 --> 01:49:56,800
you see their tits accidentally while 
they're working.

2573
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:57,790
Yeah.
And it's.

2574
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:00,190
And it's like 400,000
downloads.

2575
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:03,940
So this girl was sitting there,
she's on her tits back and forth.

2576
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:05,133
Yeah.
And just pretending it's working and 

2577
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:10,750
usually they're talking to you like 
about just mundane stuff.

2578
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:13,630
God hate to clean.
I really want to suck some cock.

2579
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:16,743
Like there's a lot of these cars.
It's moments that you get in real life 

2580
01:50:19,031 --> 01:50:22,390
when you see a woman's tit from a down 
blouse and you're like,

2581
01:50:22,391 --> 01:50:23,224
whoa.
And it's not pervy you weren't doing it 

2582
01:50:25,091 --> 01:50:26,500
on purpose.
It's very prayerful.

2583
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:29,020
What are you talking about?
If little pervy is pervious?

2584
01:50:29,021 --> 01:50:29,854
Fuck.
It's like you can almost hear a nipple 

2585
01:50:31,211 --> 01:50:32,530
but nah,
quiet.

2586
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:33,221
Oh,
I just thought,

2587
01:50:33,221 --> 01:50:36,490
I just thought how come this is on the 
youtube?

2588
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:38,860
If you could just see a nipple,
how come it's only got 16,000

2589
01:50:38,861 --> 01:50:41,650
downloads,
views people.

2590
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:43,300
Oh,
there's a need.

2591
01:50:43,301 --> 01:50:46,170
Donald trump straightaway it again.
Yeah,

2592
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:47,703
they haven't found it yet.
It's in the youtube with that lady over 

2593
01:50:49,781 --> 01:50:52,780
on the right with their big boobs.
It looks like you see her nipples to.

2594
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:54,423
Yeah,
like you know that race car video where 

2595
01:50:56,501 --> 01:50:59,950
the girls top pops open.
She's in a sports car and they're riding

2596
01:50:59,951 --> 01:51:02,380
fast as she was holding on and that are 
top pops open.

2597
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:03,393
There's something super sexy about that 
and it's not watching a girl gagging a 

2598
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:06,700
cock sucker.
That girl,

2599
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:08,171
jamie,
jamie,

2600
01:51:08,171 --> 01:51:09,004
what's.
Hold on,

2601
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,930
look at her.
She's like,

2602
01:51:10,931 --> 01:51:12,160
you went to see my tits?
Nope.

2603
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,710
Psych.
I don't think so.

2604
01:51:14,711 --> 01:51:18,010
Psych,
it's like almost.

2605
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:21,400
I'm going to do an equivalent equivalent
of this,

2606
01:51:21,401 --> 01:51:25,020
but with costco it's called down.
Digging down ticking and it's just me.

2607
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:27,370
I barely see my dick.
Oh,

2608
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:28,204
okay.
I get it.

2609
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:30,370
I get it.
It's not bad,

2610
01:51:30,371 --> 01:51:31,061
right?
No,

2611
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:33,220
not at all at this girl.
Oh,

2612
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:34,510
and you keep going.
Come on.

2613
01:51:34,511 --> 01:51:36,100
Move off to the side.

2614
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:39,280
Yeah.
Down blessings.

2615
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:42,110
But you into some weird shit.
I know.

2616
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:43,270
Shit.
What happened?

2617
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:44,613
Because I was watching.
I was watching regular porn and then it 

2618
01:51:46,451 --> 01:51:47,284
just,
it just kind of escalated and it was 

2619
01:51:48,881 --> 01:51:53,881
like truth be told,
I was with a dominatrix one time and she

2620
01:51:53,981 --> 01:51:55,930
showed me some videos.
It was bizarre shit.

2621
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,570
She showed me a video that I was like,
I don't get it,

2622
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:00,730
but then I got it.
Whoa.

2623
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:01,683
Like it was a,
it was a girl in pantyhose and she was 

2624
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:05,374
like by the pool and her friend was 
spraying with a hose and it wasn't even 

2625
01:52:08,741 --> 01:52:10,960
like that's all they were doing,
but it just looks sexy.

2626
01:52:10,961 --> 01:52:12,130
And I was like,
oh shit.

2627
01:52:12,131 --> 01:52:15,940
It doesn't have to be hardcore porn.
It can just be something hot,

2628
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:17,200
you know,
like something where you're like,

2629
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:18,093
oh fuck.
And so I had that conversation with my 

2630
01:52:20,861 --> 01:52:21,461
wife and I was like,
yeah,

2631
01:52:21,461 --> 01:52:23,770
I should find stuff to some more 
connective.

2632
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:24,963
Hm.
Here we're looking at growing borns and 

2633
01:52:26,201 --> 01:52:27,850
you're like,
how does she not,

2634
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,650
how did she get in?
They're like,

2635
01:52:29,651 --> 01:52:32,350
how come she just isn't being a model or
an actress?

2636
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:32,921
Yeah.
Like,

2637
01:52:32,921 --> 01:52:35,200
she's so beautiful.
The fuck happened.

2638
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:38,620
There's a girl that gives massages.
Do you know who the girl?

2639
01:52:38,621 --> 01:52:41,740
I'm talking about she's,
she's got black hair.

2640
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:45,020
I've watched a lot of.
I'm going to share this one time because

2641
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:45,973
you.
Would you like to share this video on 

2642
01:52:47,091 --> 01:52:48,030
facebook?
You're like,

2643
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:49,053
no,
I'm not to posted to my facebook 

2644
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:52,064
timeline.
It goes because when I was doing it two 

2645
01:52:53,361 --> 01:52:55,100
in the morning,
um,

2646
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:57,620
but uh,
there's a girl that gives.

2647
01:52:57,770 --> 01:52:59,540
She gives me massages and she's all in 
white.

2648
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:04,010
She wears all white and she is so 
beautiful.

2649
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:08,030
She might be as beautiful as anne 
hathaway,

2650
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:10,820
like that kind of just.
She looks like anne hathaway kind of,

2651
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:12,920
if anyone knows this woman I'm talking 
about,

2652
01:53:12,921 --> 01:53:15,110
send me a picture or just send it to 
jamie.

2653
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:19,190
Don't you think there's a bunch of them?
I know there's one girl specifically.

2654
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:20,143
Well,
who would have thunk that that would be 

2655
01:53:20,991 --> 01:53:21,824
a market that someone could corner the 
massage on youporn that she's got that 

2656
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:28,640
down?
Yeah.

2657
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:31,190
Whoever thought backroom,
casting couch,

2658
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:32,033
whatever.
Be a show.

2659
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:33,560
That's a whole thing.
Oh,

2660
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:36,440
I watched.
Just because I try to figure out if it's

2661
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:38,750
real or not.
I don't think he can be.

2662
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:39,763
I think after signed papers,
I know by watch it the same way I 

2663
01:53:42,231 --> 01:53:44,540
watched magician,
like I'm waiting to see the trick.

2664
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:45,100
Right?
Right.

2665
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:46,610
And we didn't see her slip up and go,
dave.

2666
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:47,510
Seriously.
And he's like,

2667
01:53:47,511 --> 01:53:48,470
what?
How do you know my name?

2668
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:52,760
I think I'd recognize that guy in the 
locker room.

2669
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:54,190
Hm?
Yeah.

2670
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:55,093
Just from his voice and his hernia.
How strange that there's a that that is 

2671
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:01,124
a genre.
Like you're excited you're there with 

2672
01:54:03,111 --> 01:54:05,480
them.
Wise casting these girls like,

2673
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:07,010
uh,
let me see what you could do.

2674
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:09,440
Okay,
now I do it now.

2675
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:09,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

2676
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:13,310
Get on your knees and your loan.
Your hotel room.

2677
01:54:13,850 --> 01:54:14,683
He says the same verbiage every time.
So I'm going to send this tape to 

2678
01:54:16,431 --> 01:54:18,910
casting directors,
but a think first I'm gonna.

2679
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,210
Need you to get naked and suck my dick 
and you're and you're.

2680
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:23,450
And you're just the look on her face 
that comes out of so fast.

2681
01:54:23,451 --> 01:54:24,860
She's like,
huh,

2682
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,840
and you and I go,
I go,

2683
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:28,610
I go literally,
if this is real,

2684
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:30,020
this is real.
And it's lasted.

2685
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:32,360
Porn stars aren't that good.
Right.

2686
01:54:32,361 --> 01:54:33,560
As an actor,
as an actor,

2687
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:34,490
they're not that good.

2688
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:35,563
Well,
I'm sure if he's made a bunch of them 

2689
01:54:36,711 --> 01:54:39,830
over the years,
he knows what he can do and not do.

2690
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:42,740
So you can always get someone to sign 
the paper after you do all this stuff.

2691
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:44,750
He should start a youtube channel with 
all the fails.

2692
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,530
All the people that walk out on him.
Do you have within,

2693
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:49,440
you can't use that footage or you borrow
their face?

2694
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:51,200
Uh,
I guess I want to see the.

2695
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:55,040
You'd want to see the reaction?
Yeah,

2696
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:58,880
I don't think you'd do that.
There's like certain laws.

2697
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:00,190
Yeah.
And you know,

2698
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,550
the laws are different in different 
states.

2699
01:55:01,551 --> 01:55:05,090
Do vegas,
you can do crazy shit in vegas.

2700
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:07,660
That's why they did crank yankers there.
Yeah.

2701
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:08,660
Have you seen,
have you seen,

2702
01:55:08,661 --> 01:55:10,100
um,
uh.

2703
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:12,770
Oh shit.
What's the step?

2704
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,780
What's the pr?
Impractical jokers?

2705
01:55:14,781 --> 01:55:15,614
No,
I have not.

2706
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:18,890
It's a funny fucking show.
I keep hearing it's really good.

2707
01:55:18,891 --> 01:55:22,130
I don't like prank shows,
but it is a funny fucking prank show.

2708
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,100
I've never been a fan of pranking 
people.

2709
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:27,470
Now I'm a,
I'm a,

2710
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,710
I'm a fan of doug stanhope and doug 
stanhope fan of them,

2711
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:32,450
so I,
I take it on by proxy.

2712
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,830
Yeah,
I watched it because it standing out.

2713
01:55:34,831 --> 01:55:36,140
I wouldn't watch it because I'm like 
prank shows,

2714
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,333
but it's fucking hilarious.
Do you know we used to have a really 

2715
01:55:39,921 --> 01:55:41,310
fucking good prank show.
Who?

2716
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:44,190
Jamie kennedy.
Dude,

2717
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:46,830
I remember that show.
Yes.

2718
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:49,650
What was it called?
The x sometimes factor x factor?

2719
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:50,790
No,
nothing was factor.

2720
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:53,340
Jamie kenny did minimum experiment.
That's it.

2721
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,433
And he used to say like,
you got axed or something like that at 

2722
01:55:57,331 --> 01:55:59,700
the end when he didn't he say something 
like that.

2723
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:02,293
Jamie kennedy is an interesting guy 
because he is extremely fucking 

2724
01:56:05,731 --> 01:56:06,564
talented,
but he's not working right now or I'll 

2725
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:10,650
see him at least some of the store the 
other day.

2726
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:13,560
Didn't see a set though.
Yeah.

2727
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:15,000
You don't hear about them that much?
It was,

2728
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:15,853
it wasn't on that show.
That ghost show ghost whisperer show or 

2729
01:56:18,871 --> 01:56:19,950
something like that.
Oh yeah,

2730
01:56:19,951 --> 01:56:20,784
because he started dating that girl.
That girl I think fucks everyone's head 

2731
01:56:22,861 --> 01:56:25,890
up love.
What's her name again?

2732
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:27,600
Jennifer love hewitt.
Oh yeah,

2733
01:56:27,601 --> 01:56:30,030
man,
I watched her day in the life on mtv and

2734
01:56:30,031 --> 01:56:34,050
it reeked of fucking crazy,
like reeked of crazy.

2735
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:36,780
She was like,
I bought you a present to her friend and

2736
01:56:36,781 --> 01:56:38,110
her friend's like,
you don't need to buy me presents.

2737
01:56:38,111 --> 01:56:38,970
I'll,
I like you.

2738
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:39,740
She's like,
I said,

2739
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:41,190
what about your president?
Wow.

2740
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,290
I'm jamie kennedy.
Did something.

2741
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:44,850
I'm going to put this out to the 
listeners.

2742
01:56:44,851 --> 01:56:48,480
If you can find this for me.
I swear to god it would be.

2743
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,980
It would be the biggest gift in the 
world.

2744
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,070
He did a show with a,
uh,

2745
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:55,890
with stu stone.
Do you know the name of that show?

2746
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:59,190
Stu stone?
It was called a getting,

2747
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,170
making it or something.
They were rappers.

2748
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:03,570
It was a scripted reality show.
So it was,

2749
01:57:03,730 --> 01:57:05,670
it wasn't a reality show.
It was scripted,

2750
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:10,671
but it was about them wanting to be hip 
hop stars all blowing up,

2751
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:11,903
blowing up.
And so there's an episode where they 

2752
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:16,950
were.
Jamie's doing a test,

2753
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:20,220
he's going to do a tv show,
a movie with tracy morgan,

2754
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:22,560
and to do,
to do the screen test.

2755
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,860
He needs to get put in blackface.
He needs to be addressed as a black man,

2756
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:27,053
so they,
they dress him as a black man and he 

2757
01:57:28,441 --> 01:57:29,274
gets all dressed up as a black guy and 
tracy morgan convinces them that he's 

2758
01:57:32,341 --> 01:57:33,174
very convincing as a black guy and that 
what he should do is him and stu stone 

2759
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:38,453
should both get in face paint and look 
like by people and then go down to the 

2760
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:42,594
three,
six mafia show and freestyle for them 

2761
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:48,690
because as black men for the three,
six mafia will really appreciate it.

2762
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:51,210
Oh,
and joe,

2763
01:57:51,370 --> 01:57:54,740
there is a moment where they're driving 
in a car to long beach address,

2764
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:58,870
black guys and they're talking to each 
other and they're like,

2765
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:04,200
do you think this is a good idea?
Is there a hidden cameras in the car?

2766
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:10,460
He's like,
no man.

2767
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:12,083
I mean,
we're just going to be trained in the 

2768
01:58:14,681 --> 01:58:19,360
order snoop's go into the three six 
mafia,

2769
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:21,693
like

2770
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:23,800
they start rapping and then he goes,
this jamie,

2771
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:32,210
this is a black person.
Go out in front of the audience.

2772
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:37,270
Joe got all black people and rap and how
good was it?

2773
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:41,010
Who gives a fuck?
And I couldn't stop.

2774
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:42,090
It

2775
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:47,090
was the greatest thing I've ever fucking
seen and I saw jamie kennedy one time at

2776
01:58:47,441 --> 01:58:49,690
the ontario improv and I was like,
dude,

2777
01:58:49,691 --> 01:58:52,750
I gotta take two seconds and tell you 
how hard that made me laugh.

2778
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:53,830
And he was like,
yeah,

2779
01:58:53,831 --> 01:58:54,664
you can't find it anywhere.
Like mtv dropped it and they like burn 

2780
01:58:56,621 --> 01:58:57,454
it.
You can't get it because he's in black 

2781
01:58:58,311 --> 01:58:59,960
face because he's in black.
He is in.

2782
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:03,390
He looks so much like a black man.
You can't even find an image,

2783
01:59:03,590 --> 01:59:05,980
a screen grab of that all.
No weird is that.

2784
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:09,810
How weird is that?
But think how strange that is.

2785
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:14,190
Like I get it that it was from minstrel 
shows or black or white men would put on

2786
01:59:14,191 --> 01:59:18,990
black face and do these offensive 
representations of black men,

2787
01:59:18,991 --> 01:59:21,480
but that's a different look.
When they were doing it,

2788
01:59:21,481 --> 01:59:22,314
they were doing like this big thing 
where they were putting like white 

2789
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:27,180
around their lips.
It was like really exaggerated.

2790
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:28,410
Do you receive that?
Uh,

2791
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:30,960
what's this guy's name?
Al jolson.

2792
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:32,040
Al jolson.
Thank you.

2793
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:34,140
Was received when he would do that.
Jamie,

2794
01:59:34,141 --> 01:59:37,200
pull up some video of al jolson in 
blackface.

2795
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:38,123
See if they take it off youtube,
do you think they take that shit down 

2796
01:59:40,711 --> 01:59:41,544
now or do you think you can catch a 
candidate that actually might be in the 

2797
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,720
public domain because it's like one of 
the first,

2798
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:47,273
but I would worry that it was offensive 
that it violates their terms of service 

2799
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,280
on.
No,

2800
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:53,280
it's already on youtube.
Okay.

2801
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:55,123
Um,
didn't bill cosby like take down the 

2802
01:59:56,971 --> 01:59:59,220
little rascals.
He owns a little rascals,

2803
01:59:59,221 --> 02:00:00,054
the little rascals and tucked it away.
So what I hear the rapists are going to 

2804
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:03,293
start airing it again.
Really rape the people that got raped 

2805
02:00:04,921 --> 02:00:06,810
because getting them ready.
We're going to start airing them.

2806
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:07,651
No,
I'm kidding.

2807
02:00:07,651 --> 02:00:10,110
I'm kidding.
Look at al jolson.

2808
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:13,860
Holy shit.
Give me some volume.

2809
02:00:17,150 --> 02:00:18,500
Jamie.
Turn this up a little bit.

2810
02:00:19,370 --> 02:00:24,370
How crazy is this around?
Hi,

2811
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:31,433
I'm a seven.
I'm wide open like he's moving into 

2812
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:51,020
tears,
like walk five miles.

2813
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,180
This is so crazy

2814
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:04,800
trying when

2815
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:12,550
it doesn't do a good impression of a 
black guy.

2816
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:15,440
Well maybe black men were different in 
the twenties.

2817
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:20,250
He's using the words.
Is it a black guy would use,

2818
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:21,730
but he's doing it as a white guy,

2819
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:22,710
as a white guy?
Yeah.

2820
02:01:23,790 --> 02:01:25,620
Well,
it's just really bizarre.

2821
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:26,663
First of all,
it's bizarre when you think that that 

2822
02:01:27,721 --> 02:01:31,650
was top of the food chain entertainment 
in 1927,

2823
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:35,820
so less than 100 years ago.
Can you imagine if somebody went to.

2824
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:39,530
You went to a concert and the dude was 
wearing black paint on

2825
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,100
with white stuff around his lips and he 
was singing that song.

2826
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,360
You would think you were in some sort of
a weird abstract,

2827
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:50,090
modern performance art show,
you know,

2828
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:53,870
some weird like alt hipster vincent 
gallo would do that now.

2829
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,823
It's something strange that.
But then he wasn't joking around that 

2830
02:01:57,871 --> 02:01:58,704
was like,
he was trying to like be what a 

2831
02:01:59,721 --> 02:02:01,340
wonderful song.
Al.

2832
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,353
What a wonderful song.
Like those people were apes like just 

2833
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:06,980
from 19,
27.

2834
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:10,280
They were so goofy.
That was fun for them to like,

2835
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:11,114
we're gonna go see the al jolson movie 
that al jolson's a hell of an 

2836
02:02:13,941 --> 02:02:16,310
entertainer.
I love when he sings.

2837
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:19,700
He's got a beautiful voice.
He just liked it.

2838
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:23,480
It was the first talkie that was the 
first movie was synchronized sound.

2839
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:26,510
That one was mad.
Just all silent films until then.

2840
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:29,000
Wow.
So that guy must have been balling.

2841
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,360
I bet he was slinging that makeup cover 
dick all over town.

2842
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:34,070
I bet there's a part of him that was 
like,

2843
02:02:34,410 --> 02:02:37,880
why do I need to put the makeup on man?
Me?

2844
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:38,863
Yeah.
They probably wouldn't know who he was 

2845
02:02:39,261 --> 02:02:39,951
at.
Other makeup.

2846
02:02:39,951 --> 02:02:41,960
Fuck.
That would suck.

2847
02:02:42,190 --> 02:02:44,030
Like gene simmons,
like you're,

2848
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:45,620
you know,
if you had the kiss makeup on,

2849
02:02:45,621 --> 02:02:47,180
you went to a bar with.
No,

2850
02:02:47,181 --> 02:02:48,014
it's up.
Another barber watching them in that 

2851
02:02:50,091 --> 02:02:53,780
first movie with that he did with tom 
selleck with letters and I was like,

2852
02:02:53,781 --> 02:02:55,040
oh shit.
That's gene simmons.

2853
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:56,263
Yeah.
He was a bad guy in a few movies and 

2854
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:59,390
he's still a bad guy.
He's a fucking asshole.

2855
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:00,400
Fuck.
Oh I hate.

2856
02:03:01,370 --> 02:03:02,600
We've covered this.
Hey,

2857
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:04,580
you had a bad experience with fuck him.
Yeah,

2858
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:08,790
he blocked me.
They'll be a annuity blocks.

2859
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,730
He blocked me.
Wow.

2860
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:13,670
That was the height of his good looking.

2861
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:17,750
This um,
did you ever have tom selleck,

2862
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:20,840
tom selleck and gene simmons?
Did they ever have.

2863
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:21,693
Well,
did you ever have a like this is gonna 

2864
02:03:24,570 --> 02:03:26,630
sound crazy.
Maybe this was just Florida,

2865
02:03:26,990 --> 02:03:27,823
but did you ever have like people 
dresses in black face for parties and 

2866
02:03:31,641 --> 02:03:32,474
stuff for like halloween?
I'm sure I probably saw it when I was 

2867
02:03:36,261 --> 02:03:39,500
young for sure.
Trying to remember a specific instance.

2868
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:40,573
I can't really like.
That was a popular costume when I was a 

2869
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:45,260
kid was being a black person.
Okay.

2870
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:48,080
You know what I know I remember I do.
Did a.

2871
02:03:48,081 --> 02:03:49,850
He played mr t.
Yeah,

2872
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:50,773
so that was a,
that was a common one and they would 

2873
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:54,620
wear blackface and they would put a 
bunch of gold chains on.

2874
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:59,990
I'm mr t dot and you put shoe polish but
like black paint all over your face.

2875
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:02,150
Yeah,
you'd have like a fake mohawk in.

2876
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:03,430
In college.
They used to have it.

2877
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:06,350
We used to have a social called weed,
a couple of socials.

2878
02:04:06,351 --> 02:04:07,184
We a social call,
pimps up hoes down where everyone would 

2879
02:04:10,341 --> 02:04:13,760
just dress like black people.
I mean it's so politically incorrect,

2880
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:14,560
but that's,
you know,

2881
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:17,890
I don't think anyone in the insight.
We had a social called uncle,

2882
02:04:17,891 --> 02:04:19,730
google beluga,
and uh,

2883
02:04:19,731 --> 02:04:20,564
I remember I was the one that organized 
it and I handed out like makeup so 

2884
02:04:23,931 --> 02:04:25,280
people could put war paint on

2885
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:31,390
and the one girl just took a picture 
just has just put it on jesus.

2886
02:04:34,660 --> 02:04:38,970
I remember her walking.
Did you share that?

2887
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:44,770
Just covered herself with it?
Facebook,

2888
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:50,100
I swear to god she posted herself.
She's like,

2889
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,070
why?
I remember this part.

2890
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,450
It was like,
why would you post that up yourself?

2891
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:56,360
How bizarre.
Yeah.

2892
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:57,213
She,
uh,

2893
02:04:57,900 --> 02:04:59,760
but that was like,
I don't remember when

2894
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,720
and did it,
and everyone was like,

2895
02:05:01,721 --> 02:05:02,710
oh,
you're not supposed to do that.

2896
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:04,293
That's right.
He was like the last white guy to try 

2897
02:05:06,071 --> 02:05:07,460
black face.
Yeah,

2898
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:09,410
like publicly try it.
They,

2899
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:10,253
the backlash was terrible and he thought
he'd get away with it because he was 

2900
02:05:11,771 --> 02:05:15,820
dating whoopi goldberg and I think he 
told a bunch of black centric joke.

2901
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:16,840
Yes.
Yeah,

2902
02:05:17,110 --> 02:05:18,520
like racist jokes.
Yeah.

2903
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:20,680
Woo.
Ted danson.

2904
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:24,100
One thing like n word jokes.
How do we have,

2905
02:05:24,130 --> 02:05:25,960
do we have transcripts of his act?
Probably.

2906
02:05:25,961 --> 02:05:27,670
There's probably a video of it.
No,

2907
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:30,940
I know there's a picture a guaranteed as
a video that shit.

2908
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,600
No,
that's not when people have,

2909
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:34,620
didn't have videos back where if you 
took a video,

2910
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:36,550
just get over real.
Yeah,

2911
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:39,640
I remember watching it.
I remember watching video of it.

2912
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,490
I think they filmed that event is for 
the friars club,

2913
02:05:42,491 --> 02:05:43,100
right?

2914
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:45,460
Something like that.
Yeah.

2915
02:05:45,461 --> 02:05:47,440
It is a weird ethnic group that you're 
not,

2916
02:05:47,441 --> 02:05:51,970
you're not allowed to be asian and 
you're not allowed to be a black guy,

2917
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:54,610
but if you're a white guy,
you can become a redhead.

2918
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:57,230
Nobody will get upset.
No.

2919
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:58,870
Literally get upset.
They get upset.

2920
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:00,033
If you were black,
you can dress in white face and no one 

2921
02:06:01,211 --> 02:06:02,170
cares.
No one cares.

2922
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:04,060
Um,
but if you're black,

2923
02:06:04,061 --> 02:06:06,190
you can't be a chinese guy.
That's offensive.

2924
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:09,070
And if you're a chinese guy,
can't pretend to be black.

2925
02:06:09,130 --> 02:06:11,020
That's offensive too.
I was,

2926
02:06:11,110 --> 02:06:13,900
I used to live with this girl from Peru 
and one halloween,

2927
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:17,560
it was when I moved to New York,
this was probably 2000.

2928
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:19,660
It was probably 19,
98 and nine.

2929
02:06:20,470 --> 02:06:22,210
And uh,
I went in,

2930
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:26,590
we went in to a room at halloween and 
she was dressed like a puerto rican,

2931
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:27,893
but she was peruvian and she was like,
she's like all the horrible stereotypes 

2932
02:06:31,691 --> 02:06:32,524
that you would say would be the things 
that lowest common denominator puerto 

2933
02:06:36,071 --> 02:06:37,930
rican woman to reduce you had all over.

2934
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:39,041
And I was like,
val,

2935
02:06:39,041 --> 02:06:40,420
you can't do that.
And she was like,

2936
02:06:40,421 --> 02:06:41,440
why not?
It's good.

2937
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:42,460
It's a good costume.
Right?

2938
02:06:42,490 --> 02:06:43,323
And I was like,
no,

2939
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:44,333
they're,
those people exist and will be around 

2940
02:06:45,461 --> 02:06:46,540
them tonight.
Like,

2941
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:49,270
can you imagine someone dress?
One is valerie.

2942
02:06:49,271 --> 02:06:50,890
And she was like,
it wouldn't bother me.

2943
02:06:50,891 --> 02:06:51,820
I go,
yeah,

2944
02:06:51,821 --> 02:06:54,130
because you have a good job and stuff 
like this.

2945
02:06:54,131 --> 02:06:56,650
Poor person's getting handed by life 
every night.

2946
02:06:56,651 --> 02:07:00,880
And you're dressing as them culture 
appropriation,

2947
02:07:01,450 --> 02:07:02,560
cultural.
What did you think about that?

2948
02:07:02,561 --> 02:07:05,380
Amy schumer cultural appropriation.
What about it or you didn't?

2949
02:07:05,410 --> 02:07:07,000
Did you know about it?
Know what you're talking about?

2950
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:12,180
Her and goldie hawn did a video of them 
singing a beyonce song,

2951
02:07:13,870 --> 02:07:14,703
but it's,
I guess it's the politicized beyonce 

2952
02:07:15,881 --> 02:07:17,470
song.
Oh,

2953
02:07:17,471 --> 02:07:18,304
okay.
They shot a cover of them doing a 

2954
02:07:21,611 --> 02:07:22,444
beyonce song.
And fucking the internet went after her 

2955
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:27,940
in a hard fucking way.

2956
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:30,490
Amy schumer and who was with her?
Goldie hawn.

2957
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:32,980
Okay.
So they're trying to be funny.

2958
02:07:33,310 --> 02:07:34,180
Yeah,
I guess.

2959
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:36,910
I mean it's not very ms dot funny I 
guess if you,

2960
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:37,773
if you'd like for if I don't know.
I didn't do audience went after because 

2961
02:07:40,331 --> 02:07:41,700
beyonce is black.
No.

2962
02:07:41,730 --> 02:07:43,860
Yeah.
And the song is about black women.

2963
02:07:43,861 --> 02:07:45,730
It's called formation.
Oh.

2964
02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:46,623
And it's about,
it's the song she did the super bowl 

2965
02:07:47,921 --> 02:07:52,921
where she stepped up on the cop car.
And loni love went after her.

2966
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:54,760
When she say she was like,
I don't know,

2967
02:07:54,761 --> 02:07:57,850
you can find the loni love clip,
but lonely love starts crying in it.

2968
02:07:58,240 --> 02:07:59,051
She's like,
she's like,

2969
02:07:59,051 --> 02:08:00,370
yeah,
how dare you take that from us.

2970
02:08:00,371 --> 02:08:01,840
This is not your story.

2971
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:04,260
Oh shit.
Yeah.

2972
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:07,050
Hm.
Hm.

2973
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:07,973
Cultural appropriation is interesting 
because I've kind of been guilty of it 

2974
02:08:11,461 --> 02:08:13,140
my whole life because I love hip hop.

2975
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:14,530
Hmm.

2976
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:16,310
What is.
Isn't that being a hip hop fan?

2977
02:08:16,311 --> 02:08:18,830
Like when does it become cultural 
appropriation?

2978
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:22,190
When you,
when you cover someone song,

2979
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:24,410
it's cultural appropriation.
Doesn't that sound weird?

2980
02:08:24,590 --> 02:08:28,940
I guess if you're pretending that that's
your life that you're talking about,

2981
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:30,013
but clearly she's not right.
She's just having fun singing a song 

2982
02:08:34,251 --> 02:08:36,650
that beyonce sings because she's a fan,
I guess.

2983
02:08:37,010 --> 02:08:39,560
Isn't that the idea?
Yeah.

2984
02:08:39,830 --> 02:08:43,310
It looks like they're having fun just 
doing it for the fuck of it.

2985
02:08:44,810 --> 02:08:45,643
I mean,

2986
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:47,740
I'm looking at this.
I see people being silly.

2987
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:52,570
What are we really getting offended by?
We're getting offended by this.

2988
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:54,500
Wanda sykes is in it.
They

2989
02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:56,200
really offended.
I didn't.

2990
02:08:56,230 --> 02:08:58,720
I didn't.
Not only did I not care,

2991
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:00,390
I couldn't sit through the video.
Well,

2992
02:09:00,391 --> 02:09:01,760
they're just being silly.
Yeah,

2993
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:02,853
I mean,
it looks to me like they're just having 

2994
02:09:03,401 --> 02:09:04,420
fun.
Who gives a shit?

2995
02:09:04,780 --> 02:09:06,460
If people were really upset about that,
like,

2996
02:09:06,461 --> 02:09:07,840
come on.
I guess there's.

2997
02:09:07,930 --> 02:09:08,763
I don't know.

2998
02:09:10,170 --> 02:09:11,010
I don't know,
man.

2999
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:14,070
I think we're finding way too many 
things to be upset with lately.

3000
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:14,911
Not anymore.
None of that.

3001
02:09:14,911 --> 02:09:19,170
Now that trump is in office,
make all them fucking videos you want.

3002
02:09:19,570 --> 02:09:20,460
You know what it is,
man,

3003
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:23,340
this is everybody getting a voice.
Everybody getting a voice.

3004
02:09:23,370 --> 02:09:24,203
The world has a voice and they're 
looking for things to be upset by and 

3005
02:09:27,121 --> 02:09:29,820
they see this and they go,
I think this is wrong.

3006
02:09:29,821 --> 02:09:31,860
You can't do that,
you know,

3007
02:09:31,861 --> 02:09:33,510
and they just decide they're gonna go 
after.

3008
02:09:33,511 --> 02:09:34,890
You can't take that from us.
Like,

3009
02:09:34,891 --> 02:09:35,760
um,
she didn't,

3010
02:09:35,761 --> 02:09:40,170
she made her own copy of a video.
She made a parody video.

3011
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:43,680
People do it all the time.
Who gives a fuck?

3012
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:45,143
It's not.
It's like,

3013
02:09:45,230 --> 02:09:48,180
it's not like you can't still watch the 
beyonce one and by the way,

3014
02:09:48,181 --> 02:09:49,560
if you don't like this,
you can make fun of it.

3015
02:09:49,561 --> 02:09:53,160
Who gives a fuck?
He's got 2 million downloads.

3016
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:56,520
Good.
But people getting upset by it,

3017
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:59,000
not good or,
or good,

3018
02:09:59,001 --> 02:10:01,440
like go ahead and get upset by it,
but it just,

3019
02:10:01,441 --> 02:10:03,390
at a certain point in time,
it gets real weird.

3020
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:06,093
You know?
It used to be you could dress like a 

3021
02:10:07,781 --> 02:10:10,540
cowboy and indian.
You can't do that anymore.

3022
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:12,400
The combo is off.
You can't.

3023
02:10:12,401 --> 02:10:17,170
A girl cannot be pocahontas anymore.
If you're a pocahontas,

3024
02:10:17,171 --> 02:10:19,090
they'll accuse you of cultural 
appropriation.

3025
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,010
They used to be a popular halloween 
costume.

3026
02:10:21,070 --> 02:10:22,870
Do it bitch.
You are not native.

3027
02:10:22,871 --> 02:10:24,910
How dare you?
Offensive piece of shit.

3028
02:10:24,911 --> 02:10:28,750
You cis gendered white privileged 
asshole.

3029
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:31,330
God dang.
Yeah.

3030
02:10:31,970 --> 02:10:33,840
When you could dress as a bomb.
Yeah.

3031
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:34,783
You can't do that anymore.
Cultural appropriation of homeless 

3032
02:10:36,801 --> 02:10:38,480
people.
Yeah.

3033
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:40,430
Yeah.
We're way too sensitive,

3034
02:10:40,431 --> 02:10:43,910
but that's how this guy got elected.
That is a big part of it.

3035
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:46,250
Big part of it.
There's a bunch of factors.

3036
02:10:46,251 --> 02:10:48,830
It's not one bunch of different reasons.
Got him elected,

3037
02:10:49,370 --> 02:10:52,220
but part of it is because we're tired.
People are tired.

3038
02:10:53,170 --> 02:10:55,730
My friend matt sent me something that's 
so hilarious.

3039
02:10:55,940 --> 02:11:00,940
This a real thing that was on tumbler 
where someone was talking about cultural

3040
02:11:01,701 --> 02:11:05,900
appropriation in terms of learning 
languages and that we in,

3041
02:11:05,901 --> 02:11:09,920
unless you're chinese,
you shouldn't learn chinese because it's

3042
02:11:09,921 --> 02:11:11,300
cultural appropriation.

3043
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:13,580
Really?
Yeah.

3044
02:11:13,581 --> 02:11:15,590
Look at this pro tip.
By the way,

3045
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:18,080
anybody who says pro tip is a douche 
bag.

3046
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:21,110
Unless you're joking around and you say 
pro tip,

3047
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,810
pro tip,
and then you say something that's really

3048
02:11:23,811 --> 02:11:25,440
stupid.
Pro tip.

3049
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:26,323
Don't learn a language.
If you do not come from the language 

3050
02:11:29,031 --> 02:11:32,480
barriers,
what the language barrier.

3051
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:33,343
The barrier of the language.
I don't learn french unless you're 

3052
02:11:36,441 --> 02:11:38,270
french.
Not french.

3053
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:41,150
Don't learn chinese.
If you're not chinese,

3054
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:44,720
don't learn icelandic.
If you're not icelandic.

3055
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:49,580
It just appropriate culture more.
That's fucking ridiculous.

3056
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:54,110
It's hard.
It's awesome because it's so silly.

3057
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:55,143
It's so silly.
I really think that's how guys like 

3058
02:11:56,901 --> 02:11:58,400
president trump get into office.

3059
02:11:58,450 --> 02:11:59,290
Dude,
I'll tell you what,

3060
02:11:59,350 --> 02:12:00,183
I obviously I voted for hillary,
but I get angry like the way the guys 

3061
02:12:04,091 --> 02:12:08,800
who voted for trump must feel the.
I get angry when I see stuff that's just

3062
02:12:08,801 --> 02:12:09,634
absurd.
Like there's a video of a doubt you've 

3063
02:12:12,971 --> 02:12:14,800
seen,
but it's your name's in it,

3064
02:12:14,801 --> 02:12:15,634
so I thought you were in it,
so I clicked it and basically as a 

3065
02:12:17,501 --> 02:12:20,890
social justice warrior,
going to an open mic and doing standup,

3066
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:23,440
but instead of doing standup,
he just keeps repeating.

3067
02:12:23,441 --> 02:12:26,890
Your jokes are not funny.
The insults hurled are real.

3068
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:27,843
These are real and it's like.
I think he's got you and jim norton are 

3069
02:12:31,541 --> 02:12:33,460
in the title of it.
Jim norton,

3070
02:12:33,461 --> 02:12:35,100
joe rogan,
social justice,

3071
02:12:35,290 --> 02:12:37,030
justice warriors stand up.
And I was like,

3072
02:12:37,060 --> 02:12:40,270
I came up in my feed on the side.
I don't know.

3073
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,153
So he's just using the stage he's using 
out that people shouldn't tell jokes 

3074
02:12:44,890 --> 02:12:45,790
because they're not funny.

3075
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:50,870
Any joke intended to harm any joke that 
has someone else's,

3076
02:12:50,890 --> 02:12:55,890
a target is harmful and that any joke 
about anything po like racial,

3077
02:12:58,060 --> 02:12:59,890
sexual,
um,

3078
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:02,170
any.
I guess that comedy is not funny.

3079
02:13:02,171 --> 02:13:03,940
I don't really know.
Did you see the,

3080
02:13:04,090 --> 02:13:06,730
you do you know the video too?
Don't even give it any attention.

3081
02:13:06,731 --> 02:13:09,280
I'm not going to be talking about.
Yeah,

3082
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:09,581
yeah,
yeah,

3083
02:13:09,581 --> 02:13:09,881
yeah,
yeah,

3084
02:13:09,881 --> 02:13:10,714
yeah,
yeah.

3085
02:13:11,290 --> 02:13:12,080
But it's,
it's.

3086
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:13,990
And I was like,
fucking that.

3087
02:13:14,350 --> 02:13:15,183
You get you're in bed and you're like,
then you're sitting upright and you're 

3088
02:13:17,081 --> 02:13:17,914
like,
this fucking this fucking idiot fucking 

3089
02:13:20,831 --> 02:13:21,670
guy exists.

3090
02:13:22,770 --> 02:13:23,603
Well,
there's people that find things 

3091
02:13:24,931 --> 02:13:25,770
offensive,
right?

3092
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:27,870
There's some people that don't find 
anything offensive.

3093
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:29,790
Some people would find anything 
offensive.

3094
02:13:29,791 --> 02:13:30,624
And then along the,
there's a bunch of people on the 

3095
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:33,443
spectrum.
All of them have their own reasons why 

3096
02:13:34,921 --> 02:13:37,740
they have a line that they draw and then
they don't like it anymore.

3097
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:40,410
And you're allowed to have a line 
anywhere you want.

3098
02:13:40,411 --> 02:13:41,420
Man,
if he.

3099
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:43,920
But you,
when you impose that on other people,

3100
02:13:44,250 --> 02:13:45,083
that's the only time it becomes a 
problem if you think for some reason 

3101
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:51,720
that just because some people like a 
certain style,

3102
02:13:51,721 --> 02:13:53,670
whether it's a style of music or style 
of art,

3103
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:56,460
anything comedy is just one thing that 
people make,

3104
02:13:56,461 --> 02:13:57,294
right?
If some people like that style and you 

3105
02:13:59,311 --> 02:14:00,144
don't and you get mad at it and then you
start deciding that these jokes are 

3106
02:14:05,401 --> 02:14:08,400
harming people and these jokes are 
damaging people.

3107
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:12,960
Well first of all,
every art form,

3108
02:14:13,110 --> 02:14:16,110
whether it's music or whether it's 
movies,

3109
02:14:16,111 --> 02:14:16,944
every art form is allowed.
This sort of false is we have this 

3110
02:14:21,331 --> 02:14:23,820
understanding that you've created some 
fiction,

3111
02:14:24,230 --> 02:14:25,063
right?
We have this understanding that this is 

3112
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:31,290
not necessarily the person who's written
this book's exact thoughts on things.

3113
02:14:32,610 --> 02:14:33,443
Nor is it the person who makes this 
movie who made a fictional movie that's 

3114
02:14:36,681 --> 02:14:37,560
like,
it's a work of art,

3115
02:14:37,561 --> 02:14:38,730
right?
They've created these scenarios.

3116
02:14:38,731 --> 02:14:39,900
These people didn't really die.
No,

3117
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:40,793
nothing really happened in that.
But in comedy for some reason you can't 

3118
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:46,320
say something ridiculously offensive.
Fulling knowing that,

3119
02:14:46,321 --> 02:14:47,154
you know,
in the audience knows you don't believe 

3120
02:14:48,031 --> 02:14:49,860
it,
but when you do do it,

3121
02:14:49,861 --> 02:14:51,290
it's really funny.
Yeah.

3122
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:54,360
So there's that weird thing where you'll
do something really funny,

3123
02:14:54,361 --> 02:14:57,000
that super offensive,
like your karate kid joke.

3124
02:14:57,420 --> 02:15:01,890
Really funny.
What was it about a mr miyagi?

3125
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:04,470
Oh yeah.
I don't want to give it away,

3126
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:06,600
but uh,
I don't care.

3127
02:15:06,601 --> 02:15:07,530
I'll tell them.
Okay.

3128
02:15:07,531 --> 02:15:08,940
You can.
Uh,

3129
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:10,193
uh,
I was wondering if you think that at 

3130
02:15:11,941 --> 02:15:14,610
some point a danielson's mom would be 
like,

3131
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:16,830
I think the janitor is trying to fuck my
kid.

3132
02:15:20,230 --> 02:15:21,270
It's true,
right?

3133
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:24,030
I forgot about that tote.
It's funny and it's offensive.

3134
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:27,060
Maybe that's not a good example because 
that's actually logical joke.

3135
02:15:27,061 --> 02:15:28,330
But there's a lot,
right?

3136
02:15:28,910 --> 02:15:31,290
It's a logical,
totally logical,

3137
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:34,680
but there's many times we say something 
that's completely ridiculous.

3138
02:15:34,681 --> 02:15:37,620
He don't meet at all and you only say it
because it's a funny thing to say.

3139
02:15:37,730 --> 02:15:38,120
Yeah.

3140
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:38,953
And you know,
to take that and to extract it and to 

3141
02:15:40,941 --> 02:15:43,410
say that that's like a hate crime when 
you know,

3142
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:45,380
you know that that person just fucking 
around like,

3143
02:15:45,410 --> 02:15:47,090
do you remember when tracy morgan got in
trouble?

3144
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:49,310
Because it said if his son was gay,
stab them.

3145
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:55,880
People get so fucking mad.
What's interesting is that there must've

3146
02:15:55,900 --> 02:16:00,310
been a few people that believed him.
He's so crazy though.

3147
02:16:00,350 --> 02:16:03,100
Tracy is always crazy.
I only met him once.

3148
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:06,450
He's a madman and that crazy.
I've only met him one fucking time.

3149
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:07,780
One story.
One time.

3150
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:10,210
That's a great story though.
I can't wait time.

3151
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:12,280
I,
I hope to run into them again.

3152
02:16:12,281 --> 02:16:13,114
I know he's heard the story and he 
didn't like it and he was like never 

3153
02:16:16,631 --> 02:16:19,530
happened,
but I can't wait to run into him.

3154
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:24,100
Tony woods.
Tony woods got a couple people.

3155
02:16:24,101 --> 02:16:25,660
Ended up telling my story,
a couple,

3156
02:16:25,870 --> 02:16:26,703
like a number of people and already 
worked with the guy was telling it and 

3157
02:16:30,401 --> 02:16:33,070
saying that it happened to him as I 
guess as what happened when it goes into

3158
02:16:33,071 --> 02:16:36,940
the ethos and tony was got fucking 
pissed because tony was.

3159
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:39,160
Tony woods was there the whole night and
tony's like,

3160
02:16:39,161 --> 02:16:39,994
that's our story.

3161
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:40,751
I was like,
yeah,

3162
02:16:40,751 --> 02:16:42,190
I know.
He was like,

3163
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:44,050
that's bullshit.
No one takes our story.

3164
02:16:44,051 --> 02:16:45,700
Burt and I was like,
yeah,

3165
02:16:45,701 --> 02:16:47,470
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

3166
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:48,970
That's how that works,
I guess.

3167
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:50,200
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

3168
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:51,033
How can it be yours?
So he didn't want you talking about it 

3169
02:16:53,261 --> 02:16:54,270
because he was talking about it.
No,

3170
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:54,431
no,
no,

3171
02:16:54,431 --> 02:16:55,450
no.
Tony was just like,

3172
02:16:55,451 --> 02:16:57,700
it's other people telling them what 
something that happened to me in you.

3173
02:16:57,701 --> 02:16:59,350
How can that,
how can that be?

3174
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:00,400
Right.
But you were there.

3175
02:17:00,670 --> 02:17:01,061
No.
Yeah.

3176
02:17:01,061 --> 02:17:02,200
Right.
So it happened to you too.

3177
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:02,651
No,
no,

3178
02:17:02,651 --> 02:17:03,484
no.
He was saying that other people were 

3179
02:17:04,781 --> 02:17:06,210
telling the tracy morgan story.
Oh,

3180
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:07,053
other people,
other than you and me and him and tony 

3181
02:17:08,501 --> 02:17:09,650
called that other thing.
Yeah,

3182
02:17:09,670 --> 02:17:10,503
he texted me and what was the number of 
people who already worked with a guy in 

3183
02:17:13,481 --> 02:17:14,440
Australia told it?

3184
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:17,020
Um,
it just became something that people are

3185
02:17:17,021 --> 02:17:17,291
like,
well,

3186
02:17:17,291 --> 02:17:19,060
it's already been stolen.
What was just all take it.

3187
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:20,440
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

3188
02:17:20,441 --> 02:17:22,750
And tony who was like really upset 
because he came late to it,

3189
02:17:22,751 --> 02:17:24,070
you know,
tony and listen to podcasts.

3190
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:27,100
He does his own fucking thing and he 
just called me one time.

3191
02:17:27,101 --> 02:17:28,330
He's like,
yo,

3192
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:29,800
sugar bear,
I'm in Australia,

3193
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,800
the fuck are these people telling our 
story for.

3194
02:17:32,801 --> 02:17:33,521
And I was like,
ah,

3195
02:17:33,521 --> 02:17:34,354
sorry,
tony,

3196
02:17:34,510 --> 02:17:35,140
just,
yeah,

3197
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:35,973
I guess that happens who's in Australia?
And they were telling someone in 

3198
02:17:39,710 --> 02:17:42,190
Australia told it and told he was in 
Australia and he heard it.

3199
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:44,680
Tony,
one of the greatest moments.

3200
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:45,703
It like,
like we had last night I was in dc and 

3201
02:17:48,791 --> 02:17:52,540
tony woods came in.
Tony lives in dc and for these you don't

3202
02:17:52,541 --> 02:17:54,520
know,
tony is one of the greatest comics.

3203
02:17:54,710 --> 02:17:56,620
Hilarious guy,
hilarious guy.

3204
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:59,290
Very slow,
like meticulous,

3205
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:00,153
like old school player.
And so tony comes in and in the back of 

3206
02:18:02,831 --> 02:18:04,480
the room he's like,
hey,

3207
02:18:04,481 --> 02:18:06,820
why don't you tell that tracy morgan's 
story?

3208
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:09,010
And I was like,
is that tony woods?

3209
02:18:09,011 --> 02:18:10,630
My wife is there,
right?

3210
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:11,980
And I go,
tony.

3211
02:18:11,981 --> 02:18:12,671
And he goes,
yeah,

3212
02:18:12,671 --> 02:18:14,710
I want to hear what it sounds like.
So I go,

3213
02:18:14,711 --> 02:18:16,330
why don't you come on stage and tell it 
with me?

3214
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:17,493
So he comes up on stage,
we have two mikes and I tell my side of 

3215
02:18:20,111 --> 02:18:20,944
the story and he corrects me because you
know how everyone's got their side of 

3216
02:18:24,131 --> 02:18:26,680
the story.
And like I remember it man.

3217
02:18:26,681 --> 02:18:31,681
I remember it very vividly that I was a 
pastor by like I was just hanging on and

3218
02:18:32,381 --> 02:18:34,630
I was there for this story.
I didn't really do anything.

3219
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:36,970
And tony's like,
that is not how that happened.

3220
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:38,343
He was like,
you.

3221
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:39,280
And then he said it.
He goes,

3222
02:18:39,281 --> 02:18:41,560
do you really think the.
He's like,

3223
02:18:41,561 --> 02:18:43,840
the reason he took his shirt off just 
because you took your shirt off.

3224
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:46,900
And I was like,
there's no fucking way he told you.

3225
02:18:46,901 --> 02:18:47,980
Remember,
is it totally different?

3226
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:48,843
The only thing we agree on is the very 
end of the story where when he said 

3227
02:18:51,671 --> 02:18:52,660
that's how you get out of pain and 
check,

3228
02:18:52,690 --> 02:18:54,760
that's the only thing we agree on.
Wow.

3229
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:55,653
Yeah.
It's interesting how two people can 

3230
02:18:56,741 --> 02:18:57,574
share an experience and it's being.
It'd be very similar in like the places 

3231
02:19:03,191 --> 02:19:04,540
like we went to.
Madame sets the bar,

3232
02:19:04,541 --> 02:19:08,560
we were at [inaudible] and I told tony,
I was like started telling on stage.

3233
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:11,260
Well,
the human memory super flawed.

3234
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:12,670
Yeah,
it's really flawed.

3235
02:19:12,671 --> 02:19:13,504
They find that more and more that when 
they're checking out crimes in 

3236
02:19:16,841 --> 02:19:17,674
particular that a human experience like 
memory is like one of the worst pieces 

3237
02:19:21,941 --> 02:19:22,774
of evidence that you could ever have.
Neil degrasse tyson was talking about 

3238
02:19:25,031 --> 02:19:25,864
it,
was tHat it's like the difference 

3239
02:19:27,921 --> 02:19:28,340
between

3240
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:30,110
an actual reality and how people 
remember it.

3241
02:19:30,111 --> 02:19:30,944
It's sometimes significantly different.
Your brain just puts together a 

3242
02:19:33,951 --> 02:19:37,110
narrative and sticks with it and then 
you know,

3243
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:38,900
if something weird happened to crazy 
happen,

3244
02:19:38,901 --> 02:19:39,734
sometimes you're all jacked up on 
adrenaline and your brain just create 

3245
02:19:42,691 --> 02:19:45,710
some goofy ass scenario and then that 
becomes your memory.

3246
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:48,260
That becomes your realIty.
How weird,

3247
02:19:48,261 --> 02:19:50,300
dude,
we're so malleable.

3248
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:51,950
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah.

3249
02:19:52,660 --> 02:19:53,493
Well hell,
you ever think of like manchurian 

3250
02:19:54,861 --> 02:19:55,694
candidate type shit like that.
The idea that they could trick you by 

3251
02:19:58,701 --> 02:19:59,534
putting a word in your head and if 
someone says that work you fucking snap 

3252
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:05,210
and you turn it into an assassin was 
pavlovian

3253
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:07,490
it,
it's got to be connected to tableau.

3254
02:20:07,570 --> 02:20:12,160
Vion because.
Because when my wife's alarm goes off on

3255
02:20:12,161 --> 02:20:14,980
her phone at 5:45,
priscilla wakes up,

3256
02:20:15,790 --> 02:20:16,623
facility,
gets up and starts wagging her tail and 

3257
02:20:17,681 --> 02:20:19,380
stands by the fridge.
She's ready to eat.

3258
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:21,370
She heard leanne's alarm go off and she 
goes,

3259
02:20:21,371 --> 02:20:22,640
now we eat.
This is how it.

3260
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:25,330
And it's almost,
it's got to be similar,

3261
02:20:25,990 --> 02:20:28,420
but there are things you could say to 
put me into a mood.

3262
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:30,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

3263
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:32,360
Like,
uh,

3264
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:34,550
like,
I mean immediately when you were like,

3265
02:20:34,830 --> 02:20:35,663
this sounds.
This is gonna sound silly about to get 

3266
02:20:36,711 --> 02:20:38,780
to the.
When I said I'm going to grab a beer and

3267
02:20:38,781 --> 02:20:41,210
you're like,
grabbed me one that makes my heart race.

3268
02:20:41,211 --> 02:20:42,990
I go our again.
Yeah,

3269
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:43,550
yeah,
yeah.

3270
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:45,710
I'm not doing it by myself.
I've got a partner obviously.

3271
02:20:45,711 --> 02:20:49,280
I like like certain things like that.
Those are pavlovian responses.

3272
02:20:49,281 --> 02:20:49,731
So give me.
You're like,

3273
02:20:49,731 --> 02:20:51,050
you want to get high?
I get excited.

3274
02:20:51,051 --> 02:20:51,831
I went,
oh yeah.

3275
02:20:51,831 --> 02:20:54,620
I would love to get out of that.
Like when,

3276
02:20:54,650 --> 02:20:58,550
like when stan hope when I see when my 
phone rings and it's stan hope I get,

3277
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:01,400
I get excited because I go,
it's one of the very few calls I don't,

3278
02:21:01,401 --> 02:21:02,234
I don't send to voicemail and I,
but even the voicemails or 10 million 

3279
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:07,724
times fucking better.
He gave me a fucking voicemail that I 

3280
02:21:10,101 --> 02:21:11,900
want to play.
It's so good.

3281
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:13,393
And,
and then sometimes you get one from him 

3282
02:21:14,541 --> 02:21:16,780
and Johnny depp and you're like fucking 
standups.

3283
02:21:16,850 --> 02:21:17,683
His fucking phone calls are the best.
So I see us or joey diaz is phone calls 

3284
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:25,040
because you know joey's d as a phone 
call is going to take 16 seconds.

3285
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:26,241
What's up?
What's up,

3286
02:21:26,241 --> 02:21:28,940
tarzan.
And then you fucking get back to me.

3287
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:29,750
Caughlin.
Yeah.

3288
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:30,380
Alright.
Alright.

3289
02:21:30,380 --> 02:21:31,550
I love you brother.
I'll talk to you later.

3290
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:36,110
Yeah.
Now we're lucky man.

3291
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:40,520
He knows some weird people.
Are you nervous about the future?

3292
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:41,383
Now that donald trump's president,
do you feel any differently because it 

3293
02:21:45,121 --> 02:21:48,090
went down,
what did it went down?

3294
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:50,370
It went down,
it went down.

3295
02:21:50,490 --> 02:21:53,220
Donald trump won the shit went down.

3296
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:54,673
I was joking on stage this weekend 
saying that it can't be that bad for me 

3297
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:02,650
as a white guy.
Like that's the truth is that he's not,

3298
02:22:02,750 --> 02:22:06,500
he's got my interest protected.
Like he's a white guy too.

3299
02:22:06,501 --> 02:22:11,501
he's not going to start out long white 
guys and his son's a white guy and it's.

3300
02:22:12,231 --> 02:22:14,780
And it's going to be tax breaks for 
people to make money,

3301
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:18,170
you know.
But I just,

3302
02:22:18,171 --> 02:22:19,460
I just,
I just don't like,

3303
02:22:19,490 --> 02:22:20,760
like,
I like this.

3304
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:22,250
Once again,
this will sound bad,

3305
02:22:22,251 --> 02:22:23,084
but I'm in my backyard.
I'm doing a press tour this morning in 

3306
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:27,300
every market,
you know,

3307
02:22:27,350 --> 02:22:30,940
everybody knows radio,
satellite tours and uh,

3308
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:34,260
the guys that are building my house,
we're all mexican and I saw them come to

3309
02:22:34,261 --> 02:22:35,730
work and I thought,
man,

3310
02:22:35,731 --> 02:22:40,290
that sucks that,
that what he said about mexicans,

3311
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:42,900
America,
America stood behind a tad bit.

3312
02:22:43,610 --> 02:22:44,443
And because these guys aren't rapists 
and murderers were the coolest guys in 

3313
02:22:46,081 --> 02:22:46,914
the world that are fucking killing 
themselves so that I can have a better 

3314
02:22:48,721 --> 02:22:52,390
life and they're doing it at wages that 
quite honestly are affordable,

3315
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:56,010
only [inaudible] their fear of losing 
their stability in this country.

3316
02:22:56,130 --> 02:23:00,090
So they don't argue with standards.
That's kind of how immigrant labor works

3317
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:03,220
a tad bit is they don't have,
they don't have an uh,

3318
02:23:03,230 --> 02:23:04,260
an uh,
a way out.

3319
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:08,700
And I thought that really fucking sucks.
And I saw it for the first time that way

3320
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:11,550
and I was Like,
these are all really cool dudes.

3321
02:23:11,551 --> 02:23:12,384
And it stinks.
That last night they saw that and they 

3322
02:23:13,411 --> 02:23:14,250
were like,
we lost.

3323
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:16,320
And maybe they didn't see it.
I don't fucking know.

3324
02:23:16,430 --> 02:23:17,690
No,
a lot of them did.

3325
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:19,850
I know some mexican folks that were 
pretty upset.

3326
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,500
And here I am,
you know,

3327
02:23:21,501 --> 02:23:22,334
on the,
on,

3328
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:23,960
on the winning team,
regardless,

3329
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:26,720
like again,
I'm going to win.

3330
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:28,730
Whoever wins.
If hillary wins,

3331
02:23:28,731 --> 02:23:30,680
I'm a liberal.
I want everyone for good things.

3332
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:32,540
I win.
If Donald Trump wins,

3333
02:23:32,990 --> 02:23:36,260
I'm in that camp too.
I when their [inaudible] you know,

3334
02:23:36,261 --> 02:23:37,790
so you're a winner,
burke,

3335
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:40,610
I'm the luckiest guy in the fucking 
world.

3336
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:45,840
[inaudible] the whole mexican thing is 
very strange because it's real.

3337
02:23:48,980 --> 02:23:49,813
This is why it's really racist.
It's not like you're dealing with an 

3338
02:23:52,341 --> 02:23:53,174
exorbitant percentage difference in the 
amount of people that are of mexican 

3339
02:23:57,201 --> 02:23:58,034
descent,
the commit crimes versus the amount of 

3340
02:23:59,331 --> 02:24:02,660
people that are american born that he 
didn't commit crimes.

3341
02:24:02,661 --> 02:24:04,040
Right.
We both agree on that.

3342
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:06,590
It's probably not much difference at 
all,

3343
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:10,280
but when someone comes here from another
country and commits a crime,

3344
02:24:10,310 --> 02:24:14,170
we look at it far worse than if someone 
who is born,

3345
02:24:14,190 --> 02:24:16,580
this patch of soil commits a crime.
You know,

3346
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:17,533
we decide that that's a big deal.
We decided that it's a bigger deal when 

3347
02:24:20,781 --> 02:24:24,620
someone from over there comes over here 
illegally and commits a crime,

3348
02:24:24,621 --> 02:24:27,710
even if it's like the same percentage as
just people,

3349
02:24:27,890 --> 02:24:29,420
you know,
if you get like 20 percent of the people

3350
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:30,770
commit crimes,
no matter,

3351
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:32,570
no matter what are immigrant or 
whatever,

3352
02:24:32,571 --> 02:24:33,404
you'll look at the immigrant ones as 
being more significant because they 

3353
02:24:36,611 --> 02:24:39,590
didn't even fuck it's supposed to be 
here and they're doing those crimes.

3354
02:24:39,630 --> 02:24:42,000
It's sliding doors.
What if that person that just never come

3355
02:24:42,001 --> 02:24:42,900
here,
that's all

3356
02:24:43,240 --> 02:24:44,073
got it.
But it's probably a percentage of the 

3357
02:24:46,361 --> 02:24:47,194
population no matter what.
And then it also depends upon what does 

3358
02:24:50,171 --> 02:24:53,410
that person experienced.
Like if they're coming from the Congo or

3359
02:24:53,411 --> 02:24:57,640
some crazy fucking place.
I remember my friend went to high school

3360
02:24:57,641 --> 02:25:01,690
with some kid,
I want to say the kid was from Jamaica.

3361
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:04,260
I'm pretty sure he's from Jamaica and 
uh,

3362
02:25:04,270 --> 02:25:08,890
apparently he was a super violent kid.
This is first time the United States and

3363
02:25:08,891 --> 02:25:10,480
he got with a fight and a fight with 
some boy.

3364
02:25:10,481 --> 02:25:11,314
He went out to his car and he got a 
fucking giant kitchen knife and he 

3365
02:25:14,621 --> 02:25:15,454
stabbed that kid right through the 
stomach in front of everybody and 

3366
02:25:18,670 --> 02:25:20,380
everybody for any cuts.
Some other kid,

3367
02:25:20,381 --> 02:25:23,050
the other kid ran away and he's chasing 
him with a knife trying to cut.

3368
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:24,550
Holy shit.
Yeah,

3369
02:25:24,551 --> 02:25:26,410
and this is his first days in America.

3370
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:29,890
They just lead them into this school and
this kid went into his fucking trunk and

3371
02:25:29,891 --> 02:25:33,670
pulled out a knife and I guess that's 
how he rocked it in Jamaica and that was

3372
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:38,320
what he had been exposed to.
So they're that kind of situation.

3373
02:25:38,321 --> 02:25:42,490
If you're letting someone into a place 
legally or illegally,

3374
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:44,020
illegally.
I don't know how he got in.

3375
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:46,720
I don't know the details of the storage,
know the story,

3376
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:49,360
but then people are scared because 
they're like,

3377
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:51,280
oh,
this person's been living in the Congo.

3378
02:25:51,281 --> 02:25:53,560
Say or so,
what is the xenophobia?

3379
02:25:53,561 --> 02:25:57,490
Then based on the fact that they don't 
subscribe to the same cultural rules,

3380
02:25:57,491 --> 02:25:58,324
we subscribe to that.
You can say that xenophobic or you can 

3381
02:26:02,291 --> 02:26:03,124
say that you're very conservative and 
nationalistic and you could look at it 

3382
02:26:05,471 --> 02:26:09,460
as a proud traits.
I mean it's a real touch and go issue,

3383
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:10,473
especially right now because what's 
going on in Germany and a lot of parts 

3384
02:26:13,991 --> 02:26:14,824
of europe where these syrian refugees 
are coming in and they've opened their 

3385
02:26:17,801 --> 02:26:21,070
arms to them in Germany and it's kind of
like really out of control.

3386
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:22,143
Like germany's had some horrible 
assaults and rapes and groups of men 

3387
02:26:25,841 --> 02:26:29,440
that are actively targeting white blonde
women for rape.

3388
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:30,423
Well,
that's the truth and I won't say any 

3389
02:26:31,601 --> 02:26:33,970
place,
but there are places in this world where

3390
02:26:33,971 --> 02:26:38,470
the social norm of rape is.
Rape is a social norm.

3391
02:26:38,890 --> 02:26:39,723
Yeah.
Women just get raped and they believe 

3392
02:26:41,410 --> 02:26:42,243
that's just what happens because there 
were women and there's a lot of those 

3393
02:26:44,861 --> 02:26:46,660
people.
There's a lot of those places.

3394
02:26:46,810 --> 02:26:48,610
A lot of those people too.
There's the.

3395
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:49,833
The sheer numbers of humans that 
subscribed to that kind of thinking 

3396
02:26:52,211 --> 02:26:53,044
still in 2016 would shock you if you 
could just look at it as numbers on a 

3397
02:26:56,081 --> 02:26:56,914
board.
If you just looked at the worldwide 

3398
02:26:58,121 --> 02:27:00,340
population and how many people would 
accept something like that,

3399
02:27:00,550 --> 02:27:01,660
you'd be like,
whoa,

3400
02:27:02,030 --> 02:27:02,863
yeah,
we're just getting rid of beating a 

3401
02:27:04,091 --> 02:27:04,924
child right now.
Adrian peterson did it and everyone 

3402
02:27:07,001 --> 02:27:09,160
fucking attacked him and I'm sure he was
like,

3403
02:27:09,161 --> 02:27:11,290
I just hit him with a switch.
It was pretty brutal,

3404
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:12,333
but now.
But there are places where in this 

3405
02:27:13,961 --> 02:27:15,460
country where you could totally hit a 
child,

3406
02:27:15,461 --> 02:27:16,294
no one would say anything,
and then there are places in the world 

3407
02:27:17,651 --> 02:27:19,660
where you can hit someone and no one 
would say anything.

3408
02:27:19,661 --> 02:27:21,000
Yeah,
and that's where it's enough.

3409
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:24,400
That's part of like if you tried to 
dissect xenophobia,

3410
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:25,863
maybe it's that is that you go there.
Social norm is different than my social 

3411
02:27:29,501 --> 02:27:31,420
norm and I don't want people.

3412
02:27:32,180 --> 02:27:33,013
I mean is that,
that sounds like I'm defending 

3413
02:27:34,071 --> 02:27:35,360
xenophobia.
Well,

3414
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:38,210
I have a theory that I've said several 
times in the podcast.

3415
02:27:38,211 --> 02:27:41,300
Excuse me if you've heard it.
That's the cradle of civilization.

3416
02:27:41,330 --> 02:27:43,520
If you go to the middle east,
that's where civilization began.

3417
02:27:43,521 --> 02:27:46,640
It's the oldest written language,
the oldest form of mathematics,

3418
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:47,573
like sumir,
like that's responsible for all these 

3419
02:27:49,611 --> 02:27:51,730
different first first agriculture.
Like they,

3420
02:27:51,731 --> 02:27:52,564
they were like a really depending upon 
when you think that human human 

3421
02:27:55,521 --> 02:27:58,010
civilization was established,
whether it was reestablished,

3422
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:01,750
but those people back then that,
that was a,

3423
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:06,830
a really complicated civilization and it
was like 6,000

3424
02:28:06,831 --> 02:28:07,664
years ago.

3425
02:28:08,540 --> 02:28:11,120
Yeah,
I mean

3426
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:15,480
we,
when we try to think about like how long

3427
02:28:15,481 --> 02:28:16,314
human beings have been on this planet 
and how long we been living our lives 

3428
02:28:20,371 --> 02:28:23,210
and what we've been doing.
This is a really,

3429
02:28:23,211 --> 02:28:27,380
really recent thing.
Very do think about this.

3430
02:28:27,381 --> 02:28:30,470
Slavery was just 200 years ago.
Yup.

3431
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:31,850
18,
65

3432
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:37,040
black people just got rights as humans 
in the sixties that,

3433
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:41,250
that's.
So like,

3434
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:42,093
I like one of the things I watched roots
and one of the things that blew me away 

3435
02:28:45,031 --> 02:28:46,260
was that,
was that,

3436
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:48,053
uh,
what's it called when black people talk 

3437
02:28:49,821 --> 02:28:51,800
like black people?
It was a robotics.

3438
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:54,090
I remember when a bonox came out and 
people,

3439
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:56,370
conservatives were fucking up and arms,
hey,

3440
02:28:56,371 --> 02:28:58,410
learn the language,
speak the way we speak.

3441
02:28:58,830 --> 02:29:00,300
And then I thought,
hey motherfucker,

3442
02:29:00,301 --> 02:29:01,134
when we brought them here,
we didn't teach him how to speak at all 

3443
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:05,270
when when they were brought as slaves,
it was better.

3444
02:29:05,271 --> 02:29:05,310
Yeah,

3445
02:29:05,310 --> 02:29:06,143
they didn't speak english.
But you know what the problem with that 

3446
02:29:07,980 --> 02:29:10,860
kind of thinking is on both sides.
Problem kind of thing is.

3447
02:29:10,861 --> 02:29:12,420
First of all,
you didn't bring any slaves over here.

3448
02:29:12,421 --> 02:29:14,160
I didn't bring anybody.
They weren't slaves.

3449
02:29:14,610 --> 02:29:17,640
So both things are fucked up,
but their ancestors were.

3450
02:29:17,641 --> 02:29:21,480
So we're acknowledging there's a ripple.
There's a giant ripple effect from being

3451
02:29:21,481 --> 02:29:25,710
brought over here as slaves.
That to me says that like what we should

3452
02:29:25,711 --> 02:29:26,544
have done and what we probably still 
should do is figure out a way and not 

3453
02:29:30,091 --> 02:29:30,924
just that ripple,
but the poor immigration ripple that's 

3454
02:29:32,730 --> 02:29:34,440
in white neighborhoods,
russian neighborhoods.

3455
02:29:34,830 --> 02:29:35,663
You got to figure out a way to like get 
neighborhoods that are like really 

3456
02:29:38,671 --> 02:29:40,230
fucking poor.
Those are traps,

3457
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:42,930
especially if their crime ridden 
neighborhoods that are really poor.

3458
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:44,333
We've got to clean those up,
have cuts that we just let scab up and 

3459
02:29:47,491 --> 02:29:52,491
fester and we don't treat it and dress 
the wound like that's kind of dangerous.

3460
02:29:52,590 --> 02:29:56,340
Crime ridden neighborhoods are there 
like cultural wounds and we don't.

3461
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:58,380
We don't do shit about him because it's 
not us.

3462
02:29:58,381 --> 02:29:59,214
It's us.
It's can't fucking pay attention to 

3463
02:30:00,121 --> 02:30:02,460
that.
But if presidents did that,

3464
02:30:02,820 --> 02:30:03,653
instead of fucking flying over to 
Afghanistan and dealing with some 

3465
02:30:05,671 --> 02:30:06,504
nonsense,
that has almost nothing to do with you 

3466
02:30:07,411 --> 02:30:08,244
and me.
If you could make an argument that we 

3467
02:30:10,201 --> 02:30:12,820
can intervene in Mexico right now,
if you.

3468
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,640
If you really wanted to protect peace 
and love.

3469
02:30:14,670 --> 02:30:15,503
I mean every time you go to juarez and 
you see a bunch of dudes heads cut off 

3470
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:21,300
and they're hanging them from fucking 
overpass with some sign,

3471
02:30:21,301 --> 02:30:24,210
they put some cops,
chop them up in garbage bags.

3472
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:26,280
You know this,
this,

3473
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:27,830
you know,
there's a good argument that you.

3474
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:29,760
All the drugs are coming from these 
people too.

3475
02:30:29,761 --> 02:30:31,260
It's a good argument.
You go to the war with them.

3476
02:30:31,261 --> 02:30:33,550
They never even bring that up,
that up.

3477
02:30:34,830 --> 02:30:36,150
Never.
It's right there.

3478
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:38,220
God dang it.

3479
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:39,523
You know what fucking sent me through 
the roof and this election is the media 

3480
02:30:41,901 --> 02:30:42,734
coverage.
The one of the things that I was I was 

3481
02:30:45,530 --> 02:30:46,363
watching like I was laying in bed with 
yesterday and I was just kind of 

3482
02:30:49,101 --> 02:30:51,680
listening to the thing and they were.
There were saying statements like,

3483
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:53,870
well,
Florida is definitely going to vote.

3484
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:54,973
A torta is definitely going to vote 
democratic because of the hispanic 

3485
02:30:59,691 --> 02:31:01,370
population.
How rude.

3486
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:02,390
I thought,
what I thought,

3487
02:31:02,391 --> 02:31:07,391
what an ignorant statement to assume 
cubans and mexicans are identical,

3488
02:31:08,470 --> 02:31:09,303
stupid.
He didn't say I'm cubans are that he 

3489
02:31:11,491 --> 02:31:14,990
said mexicans and I,
from my experience,

3490
02:31:14,991 --> 02:31:15,824
and this is limited,
but I did grow up in Florida and I do 

3491
02:31:17,181 --> 02:31:20,700
live in la and that's where these the 
differences.

3492
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:23,730
Cubans will speak spanish in front of 
you.

3493
02:31:24,210 --> 02:31:25,920
Mexicans don't speak spanish in front of
you.

3494
02:31:26,490 --> 02:31:28,120
When you hang out with like two 
mexicans,

3495
02:31:28,121 --> 02:31:31,950
you're standing in like say you're at 
like in line or something.

3496
02:31:32,130 --> 02:31:32,963
Mexican is usually just try to 
assimilate so they don't raise the red 

3497
02:31:35,101 --> 02:31:35,934
flag.
It's all based on the fact that as a 

3498
02:31:36,841 --> 02:31:38,250
cuban,
if you come over to this country,

3499
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:39,173
if you step foot on the land,
you're automatically a citizen as a 

3500
02:31:41,101 --> 02:31:42,480
mexican.
They don't want you here.

3501
02:31:42,510 --> 02:31:44,040
They want to send you back.
Is that the case still?

3502
02:31:44,041 --> 02:31:46,590
So if you're a cuban refugee and you 
land in America,

3503
02:31:46,690 --> 02:31:47,780
the second you step foot,
you're,

3504
02:31:47,781 --> 02:31:49,240
you're naturalized citizen.
Oh,

3505
02:31:49,250 --> 02:31:50,083
weird.
And that is the bone of contention 

3506
02:31:51,421 --> 02:31:53,400
between cubans and mexicans.
Is that.

3507
02:31:53,490 --> 02:31:54,323
And that's why cubans,
when you go to miami to cuban guys will 

3508
02:31:56,431 --> 02:31:57,264
speak spanish right in front of you,
right in front of your face and you're 

3509
02:31:58,651 --> 02:31:59,471
just like,
oh,

3510
02:31:59,471 --> 02:32:00,640
you guys talking about me or.

3511
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:03,780
Well,
Cuba also,

3512
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:06,000
cubans rather,
they tend to be more conservative.

3513
02:32:06,050 --> 02:32:07,680
Yeah.
Much more conservative vote.

3514
02:32:07,710 --> 02:32:11,010
Very republican,
very conservative.

3515
02:32:11,011 --> 02:32:12,780
Uh,
sort of having said that,

3516
02:32:12,781 --> 02:32:15,390
a lot of miami did vote democrat,
I think,

3517
02:32:15,391 --> 02:32:17,940
but I think that's predominantly the 
jewish population,

3518
02:32:17,941 --> 02:32:18,774
the snowbirds that came down because it 
started in like broward county and what 

3519
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:22,333
went down.
Yeah.

3520
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:23,910
But I mean,
but I grew up in Florida.

3521
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:24,920
Cubans were,
eh,

3522
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:27,660
there's no,
there's no limit to just miami.

3523
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:29,940
Yeah,
now all my best friends are cuban.

3524
02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:33,540
Did Cuba has an interesting kind of a 
flair to it,

3525
02:32:33,541 --> 02:32:34,374
right?
Because it's got a different thing than 

3526
02:32:37,081 --> 02:32:40,720
say Mexico.
Like you think like their,

3527
02:32:40,750 --> 02:32:42,390
their language has a little bit more of 
a,

3528
02:32:42,391 --> 02:32:46,470
like a song type of thing to.
It took a little more flow to it,

3529
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:49,320
you know,
they're all dancy and movie and shit and

3530
02:32:49,321 --> 02:32:50,940
they have incredible athletes.

3531
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:53,610
Fucking incredible.
After you fucking write about that.

3532
02:32:53,611 --> 02:32:54,444
Like if you like,
if you were going to do a dance of the 

3533
02:32:56,131 --> 02:32:58,410
two languages,
that's going to be like more like,

3534
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,160
oh,
what cubans.

3535
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:02,060
Like.
Oh wow.

3536
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:05,320
Yeah,
they have a quicker sort of a.

3537
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:06,773
There's a flare to those people.
Can we used to say words like cuban 

3538
02:33:09,391 --> 02:33:10,224
phrases,
like a most lhasa or get bottle sits on 

3539
02:33:14,380 --> 02:33:19,380
the mexicans out though is like how gay 
kipato like a duck.

3540
02:33:20,010 --> 02:33:21,450
Are you allowed to say tHat still or is 
that.

3541
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:22,990
You can say it in spanish.
Oh yeah.

3542
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,350
You're not racist if you're saying in 
spanish.

3543
02:33:24,570 --> 02:33:26,010
Racist.
I said money on the,

3544
02:33:26,310 --> 02:33:28,200
on the,
on the radio the other day.

3545
02:33:28,470 --> 02:33:29,970
What is Monaco and again,
gay guy?

3546
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:32,010
You can say that.
I guess.

3547
02:33:32,011 --> 02:33:34,200
I don't know.
We'll see if it come back to haunt you.

3548
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:35,340
LEt's.
Let's run the gamut.

3549
02:33:35,340 --> 02:33:38,370
I'll say gypsy pikey and muddy going and
see if I get in trouble.

3550
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:40,680
Pikeys still touchy if you're in 
england.

3551
02:33:40,890 --> 02:33:43,530
Yeah.
I have a friend who lives in england and

3552
02:33:43,531 --> 02:33:44,364
their neighbor,
their friend actually lives also in 

3553
02:33:47,731 --> 02:33:48,564
england,
had a bunch of pikeys moving next door 

3554
02:33:51,601 --> 02:33:52,980
to them.
Oh,

3555
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:57,240
they've told her the caravan.
They pulled up the caravan and they just

3556
02:33:57,241 --> 02:34:00,180
decided to live in this neighborhood and
then they,

3557
02:34:00,181 --> 02:34:01,560
uh,
there's an open lot.

3558
02:34:01,590 --> 02:34:03,690
So thEy pulled into this open loud the 
caravan.

3559
02:34:03,691 --> 02:34:05,310
They stay up to 2:00
in the morning.

3560
02:34:05,580 --> 02:34:07,930
They started having parties and started 
robbing the neighborhood.

3561
02:34:09,620 --> 02:34:14,620
And these fucking people have these bomb
ass country houses outside of london and

3562
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:16,230
they're just living the dream,
you know,

3563
02:34:16,231 --> 02:34:17,470
they make this dope ass.

3564
02:34:18,770 --> 02:34:22,180
They make this dope ass house in this 
beautiful countryside.

3565
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:24,250
And the pikeys moving right next door.
I don't know if,

3566
02:34:24,310 --> 02:34:27,520
is that a bad word?
Pikey travelers.

3567
02:34:27,521 --> 02:34:30,190
I think they prefer to call themselves 
so I'll be respectful so they.

3568
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:31,033
The is move in.
they pull up the caravans which are 

3569
02:34:32,621 --> 02:34:35,050
mobile homes.
They leave garbage everywhere,

3570
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:37,870
they fucking steal shit and they can't 
get rid of them.

3571
02:34:37,871 --> 02:34:39,700
They can't get them out of there because
there have,

3572
02:34:39,730 --> 02:34:43,120
because of their culture,
their culture is that they travel around

3573
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:44,253
and so the european government or the uk
government has established there's 

3574
02:34:47,821 --> 02:34:51,370
certain like things that they're allowed
to do and one of them is they're allowed

3575
02:34:51,371 --> 02:34:52,204
to just like live in a place where 
nobody lives there so arbitrary within 

3576
02:34:57,911 --> 02:34:58,744
reason.
I mean should they have like boundaries 

3577
02:35:00,101 --> 02:35:02,980
where you're not supposed to go,
but next to this guy's fucking house,

3578
02:35:02,990 --> 02:35:04,970
they were allowed to lick and lose my 
mind.

3579
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:10,170
This guy's like this really wealthy guy 
that bought this insane house out in the

3580
02:35:10,171 --> 02:35:11,004
london countryside and travelers moved 
in right next door and they party all 

3581
02:35:15,331 --> 02:35:17,130
night.
They have bonfires and shit.

3582
02:35:17,180 --> 02:35:18,670
Oh,
fucking bonfire.

3583
02:35:18,740 --> 02:35:20,780
They beat guys asses if they talk shit 
to him,

3584
02:35:22,270 --> 02:35:23,103
you know,
maybe this isn't a good place to have a 

3585
02:35:24,330 --> 02:35:26,220
fire at 2:00
in the morning.

3586
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:29,070
They step up,
punch that dude in the face and laugh,

3587
02:35:29,220 --> 02:35:30,690
oh,
nobody can do shit.

3588
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:32,453
They live at different world.
They live in a totally different life 

3589
02:35:35,880 --> 02:35:37,710
than you or I,
but there are people.

3590
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:39,690
People were just so malleable,
man.

3591
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:41,573
That's what I was getting at before.
That's why one of the things that 

3592
02:35:43,471 --> 02:35:44,304
concerns me about trump is that the 
president becomes sort of the way the 

3593
02:35:49,141 --> 02:35:53,290
people that follow him,
he leads the way they,

3594
02:35:53,370 --> 02:35:54,203
they sort of fall in and least in some 
way he represents how we feel about 

3595
02:35:57,031 --> 02:35:57,864
ourselves.
So if we feel about ourselves like a 

3596
02:35:59,671 --> 02:36:00,570
really,
you know,

3597
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:03,090
the wall just got 10 feet higher,
you know,

3598
02:36:03,091 --> 02:36:03,924
that kind of stuff that could encourage 
some ridiculous douche baggery from 

3599
02:36:08,131 --> 02:36:10,420
people that might otherwise be persuaded
to,

3600
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:14,370
to relax and settle in.
Like people might go the other way now.

3601
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:15,913
What do you mean?
People might get more aggressive and 

3602
02:36:17,311 --> 02:36:19,440
more shitty now that trump is in office?

3603
02:36:19,650 --> 02:36:20,790
Oh dude,
I got.

3604
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:21,653
I got to be really honest with you.
Trumping elected gave me a lot of 

3605
02:36:24,571 --> 02:36:26,210
confidence.
Why?

3606
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:29,190
I don't know.
I don't know because I just was like,

3607
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:32,280
I just never thought that would happen.
Like I never thought that it happened.

3608
02:36:32,281 --> 02:36:33,091
Then I thought,
oh,

3609
02:36:33,091 --> 02:36:35,130
that's right.
Crazy shit happens all the time.

3610
02:36:35,610 --> 02:36:37,990
Like crazy shit happens all the time.
All the time.

3611
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:38,880
Like,
no,

3612
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:40,050
I'm not saying I want to be a movie 
star,

3613
02:36:40,051 --> 02:36:41,970
but like I could be a movie star 
tomorrow.

3614
02:36:42,190 --> 02:36:44,550
Like someone could go a couple of weeks 
but I'll take a couple of weeks,

3615
02:36:44,770 --> 02:36:45,840
maybe take seven months.
But,

3616
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:46,923
but like that could happen tomorrow.
I can have my own sitcom if I wanted it 

3617
02:36:49,050 --> 02:36:52,020
tomorrow because that could happen 
because trump became president and I got

3618
02:36:52,030 --> 02:36:53,970
real bounce in my step.
Wow.

3619
02:36:54,250 --> 02:36:55,590
It was.
Anything's possible.

3620
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:56,593
Anything's fucking.
I really thought there was no fucking 

3621
02:37:00,391 --> 02:37:05,350
way in hell that would ever happen.
I mean I almost thought last night was a

3622
02:37:05,351 --> 02:37:06,184
wash and I don't know why we're even 
referencing the election and then all 

3623
02:37:09,421 --> 02:37:13,710
the sudden bill burrs,
like they just took fucking Ohio.

3624
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:15,140
Yeah.
It was like,

3625
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:15,980
like a war.

3626
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:19,250
Like you took Pennsylvania.
He took Florida.

3627
02:37:19,370 --> 02:37:20,203
Yeah.
There are still undecided in New 

3628
02:37:22,430 --> 02:37:24,050
Hampshire.
Took Idaho.

3629
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:28,250
What they saying that it was kind of 
down to Alaska and when he got Alaska is

3630
02:37:28,251 --> 02:37:30,990
when someone said he just one boom,
they go,

3631
02:37:31,010 --> 02:37:31,843
he just got Alaska,
he won and that's the state that nobody 

3632
02:37:33,801 --> 02:37:35,510
campaigns.
And that's what's interesting.

3633
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,590
No one campaigns in Alaska.
Well I don't.

3634
02:37:37,670 --> 02:37:38,503
Maybe they do,
but I think for the most part they 

3635
02:37:39,891 --> 02:37:43,090
ignore it because that's the last date 
where you get the results in last.

3636
02:37:43,091 --> 02:37:43,924
It's way the fuck over there.
You know if you're looking at a map or 

3637
02:37:45,891 --> 02:37:47,470
Alaska is.
Yeah,

3638
02:37:47,740 --> 02:37:49,910
you gotta go all the way up and then he 
got to go left.

3639
02:37:49,940 --> 02:37:52,610
It's all the way the fuck up by Russia.
Way up there,

3640
02:37:52,611 --> 02:37:54,080
dude.
Have you gone hunting up there?

3641
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:55,820
Yes,
dude.

3642
02:37:56,210 --> 02:37:58,130
It's amazing.
Except the bugs.

3643
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:01,490
The bugs are brutal.
The mosquitoes are off the chain,

3644
02:38:01,540 --> 02:38:02,373
but nothing like in your life you can't 
even breathe because they go in your 

3645
02:38:05,061 --> 02:38:05,571
mouth.
Yeah,

3646
02:38:05,571 --> 02:38:07,370
they are.
And I went fishing.

3647
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:08,263
We went salmon fishing uP there.
We did some gigs and we got out of the 

3648
02:38:12,081 --> 02:38:14,540
car to get to the boat and when we got 
out of the car,

3649
02:38:14,541 --> 02:38:15,374
literally opening the door,
there was a cloud of mosquitoes that 

3650
02:38:17,571 --> 02:38:18,404
found us instantly in swarmed us.
WE panicked like little girls jumped 

3651
02:38:21,201 --> 02:38:22,034
back in the car and shut the door.
We started to change our shoes while 

3652
02:38:24,501 --> 02:38:27,260
we're in the car and there was 100 
mosquitoes in the car with us.

3653
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,630
It was the huggins.
Same.

3654
02:38:28,631 --> 02:38:29,464
Same.
They only have like a couple months to 

3655
02:38:30,501 --> 02:38:31,410
live.
Yeah,

3656
02:38:31,730 --> 02:38:34,520
and they all come out in droves,
but I'll tell you what I like,

3657
02:38:34,521 --> 02:38:38,070
dude.
I like alaskan people a lot alike.

3658
02:38:38,110 --> 02:38:39,620
hazing.
I like,

3659
02:38:39,660 --> 02:38:41,300
uh,
people in anchorage a lot.

3660
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:44,600
I liked the people at bars.
I like people that you met.

3661
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:47,210
There's a certain feeling that they 
have.

3662
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:51,260
They're more alive because they have to 
deal with nature.

3663
02:38:51,710 --> 02:38:54,500
They're more alive because they have to 
deal with grizzly bears.

3664
02:38:54,501 --> 02:38:58,080
When we were there at grizzly bear 
stumbled into some fucking school there.

3665
02:38:58,081 --> 02:39:00,890
The grizzly bear is walking the outside 
perimeter of some school.

3666
02:39:00,891 --> 02:39:01,724
They were talking about it or they had a
fucking chase it off like what a giant 

3667
02:39:05,181 --> 02:39:06,014
one,
like a big 10 foot grizzly bear was 

3668
02:39:07,701 --> 02:39:12,140
wandering through some backyard area.
Moose walk onto college campuses all the

3669
02:39:12,141 --> 02:39:12,974
time.
When I came in and when I landed in 

3670
02:39:13,581 --> 02:39:15,410
anchorage,
I got into the car from the.

3671
02:39:15,470 --> 02:39:16,303
I got in the car from the airport to the
hotel at a moose crossing the street on 

3672
02:39:19,581 --> 02:39:22,160
the way to the hotel,
jesus by the airport.

3673
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:24,200
It was by the airport and I went.
I freaked out.

3674
02:39:24,201 --> 02:39:25,130
I was Like,
are you shitting me?

3675
02:39:25,131 --> 02:39:25,600
And he was like,
yeah,

3676
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:26,540
it happens all the time,
man.

3677
02:39:26,860 --> 02:39:29,690
You got to be real careful if you're 
running a moose when it's running.

3678
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:35,150
Like now when it gets cold out,
like right around late october,

3679
02:39:35,151 --> 02:39:36,260
probably mid,
mid,

3680
02:39:36,261 --> 02:39:37,094
late october.
But they get horny as fuck and they get 

3681
02:39:39,951 --> 02:39:40,784
super aggressive and they'd get so 
stupid like their dick is so hard and 

3682
02:39:46,011 --> 02:39:46,844
they're so fucked up.
Imagine if You could only have sex once 

3683
02:39:48,411 --> 02:39:50,330
a year.
Just imagine being a person.

3684
02:39:50,750 --> 02:39:55,750
You can only have sex once a year and 
when you start getting towards that time

3685
02:39:56,301 --> 02:39:59,520
of the year,
you start growing weapons on your head.

3686
02:40:00,610 --> 02:40:02,450
You said that you said that on the 
podcast,

3687
02:40:02,660 --> 02:40:04,430
so they don't always have horns.
No.

3688
02:40:04,460 --> 02:40:07,280
The antlers fall off.
These antlers are act.

3689
02:40:07,281 --> 02:40:10,940
We actually looked it up this weekend.
They're made out of bone there.

3690
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:13,070
I heard this pop.
What did you do this with?

3691
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:14,520
Dudley?
John Dudley

3692
02:40:14,830 --> 02:40:18,260
and I was a fascinating podcast.
Which has happened.

3693
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:20,250
What happened to him?
What happened?

3694
02:40:20,930 --> 02:40:23,650
Did we go down?
Oh,

3695
02:40:23,820 --> 02:40:25,860
they just like light flicker or 
something like that.

3696
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:28,010
We gotta get the fuck out of here,
man.

3697
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:29,160
Fucking trump,
man.

3698
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:30,023
Now that trump's in order,
he's going to hurt me making fun of his 

3699
02:40:31,711 --> 02:40:36,060
hair.
I want to get to things to trump a razor

3700
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:39,900
like one of those electric air buzzers 
and a bag of mushrooms.

3701
02:40:39,990 --> 02:40:41,220
That's all I need from you,
buddy.

3702
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:42,623
You're raising my taxes.
Just let me see thIs bag and do this to 

3703
02:40:45,751 --> 02:40:48,210
your hair.
Would love to fuck with this hair.

3704
02:40:48,930 --> 02:40:50,310
Just shave it off,
man.

3705
02:40:50,311 --> 02:40:51,144
Let it go.
That's not nothing good going on up 

3706
02:40:52,981 --> 02:40:55,020
there.
Good tweets today though.

3707
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:55,771
Diddy?
No,

3708
02:40:55,771 --> 02:40:56,220
no,
no.

3709
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:57,930
A comic's comics.
Oh,

3710
02:40:57,931 --> 02:40:58,561
would they say?
Yeah.

3711
02:40:58,561 --> 02:41:00,980
The ones that weren't too butthurt about
it with.

3712
02:41:00,990 --> 02:41:04,050
There's a lot of butter to it was so 
ridiculous.

3713
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:05,071
Like,
come on,

3714
02:41:05,071 --> 02:41:05,970
let it,
let it play out.

3715
02:41:05,971 --> 02:41:07,400
Let's see what this says.
Yeah.

3716
02:41:07,580 --> 02:41:09,780
Like friends of mine who I go,
I know we're funny.

3717
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:12,240
We're just like,
like just saying,

3718
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:14,790
just like really not even like trying to
be funny about it.

3719
02:41:14,830 --> 02:41:16,470
Like this isn't funny.
There's nothing funny about it.

3720
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:20,040
You need to have a serious conversation 
with your children about racism and rape

3721
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:21,750
and you're like,
huh,

3722
02:41:22,710 --> 02:41:24,220
okay.
Well what about hillary clinton?

3723
02:41:24,221 --> 02:41:24,721
Then said,
whoa,

3724
02:41:24,721 --> 02:41:27,120
you want her in office?
Hillary clinton,

3725
02:41:27,121 --> 02:41:27,954
defendant a child rapist.
It was laughing about the child rapist 

3726
02:41:30,130 --> 02:41:30,963
being able to pass a polygraph.
Do you remember when we were wIth norm 

3727
02:41:32,910 --> 02:41:33,743
in the back of the comedy store and he 
was talking about bill clinton's 

3728
02:41:35,761 --> 02:41:37,620
charges.
I looked those up.

3729
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:39,450
Yeah,
those are fucking legit.

3730
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:40,830
Yeah.
There's a lot of stuff with.

3731
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:42,480
I mean,
who knows how much of it is real.

3732
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:46,560
They allegedly did a lot of shit and 
allegedly,

3733
02:41:47,370 --> 02:41:49,680
you know what man,
who knows,

3734
02:41:49,890 --> 02:41:52,140
but not good.
None of it's good.

3735
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:53,093
It's all gross.
So it's not like if Donald Trump didn't 

3736
02:41:56,791 --> 02:41:58,230
get in,
we will hear out an angel,

3737
02:41:59,070 --> 02:41:59,903
you know,
anyone of that age set that's a weird 

3738
02:42:02,371 --> 02:42:03,204
age bracket because like I'm the age,
I'm the generation where when I got to 

3739
02:42:07,951 --> 02:42:10,350
college they came up with the phrase no 
means no.

3740
02:42:10,550 --> 02:42:13,260
Just they explained date rape at my age.
I'm 44.

3741
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:14,513
So you think anyone over 40 for any 
woman over 44 probably dealt with date 

3742
02:42:18,331 --> 02:42:19,810
rape and,
and,

3743
02:42:19,870 --> 02:42:23,550
and a lot of times there was a like a 
stigma do not talk about it,

3744
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:26,340
you know?
Yeah man.

3745
02:42:26,341 --> 02:42:26,591
And,
and,

3746
02:42:26,591 --> 02:42:27,424
and,
and I'm just saying I'm the very 

3747
02:42:27,721 --> 02:42:28,554
beginning.
There's a whole generation of girls my 

3748
02:42:29,971 --> 02:42:32,490
age and just younger that have dealt 
with it in the same way,

3749
02:42:32,610 --> 02:42:33,443
but now it's being brought to the 
forefront and people are coming forward 

3750
02:42:35,671 --> 02:42:36,504
and saying stuff.

3751
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:40,300
Donald trump is what 70 did he,
I mean he,

3752
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:43,020
I think he could hit women when he was a
kid probably.

3753
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:45,600
They probably hit women,
they didn't think anything of it.

3754
02:42:45,690 --> 02:42:46,523
His dad throw his mom,
mom down a flight of stairs and no one 

3755
02:42:49,681 --> 02:42:52,260
would say a fucking word.
The stairs is rough.

3756
02:42:52,410 --> 02:42:53,700
Yeah.
Maybe you're on the couch.

3757
02:42:53,950 --> 02:42:57,450
just thrown on the couch.
Just get off me.

3758
02:42:58,560 --> 02:42:59,393
Get off me.
Can you throw them somewhere nice and 

3759
02:43:02,491 --> 02:43:05,880
soft and like you don't.
You decelerate when you let go.

3760
02:43:07,580 --> 02:43:12,160
Just like a light judo demonstration.
If you dated a judo check dated

3761
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:14,590
ronda rousey and she just got mad at you
and start fucking hip,

3762
02:43:14,591 --> 02:43:16,920
toss it around the house right to the 
coffee table,

3763
02:43:19,220 --> 02:43:22,030
right to the glass coffee table.
Like one of those lethal weapon movies.

3764
02:43:22,830 --> 02:43:24,570
Just fucking.
She is.

3765
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:26,670
Grabs you and hip tosses.
You do.

3766
02:43:27,450 --> 02:43:30,250
We're in the front yard.
The sprinklers are going off the exact.

3767
02:43:31,350 --> 02:43:35,680
That lethal weapon.
He used the [inaudible] triangle choke.

3768
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:39,040
That was the first time we ever saw a 
triangle choke in a movie ever.

3769
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:40,053
Mel gibson lethal weapon.
He played that crazy guy and he learned 

3770
02:43:42,851 --> 02:43:45,220
from horian.
He learned jiu jitSu from horian gracie.

3771
02:43:45,310 --> 02:43:45,911
Really?
Yeah.

3772
02:43:45,911 --> 02:43:50,020
Horian gracie was the stunt coordinator 
for that movie and he helped,

3773
02:43:50,110 --> 02:43:50,990
um,
that,

3774
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:54,760
that movie sorta helped get him in with 
a lot of hollywood people that wanted to

3775
02:43:54,761 --> 02:43:55,594
learn jujitsu.
I realized how effective they love to 

3776
02:43:58,211 --> 02:44:00,040
party with mel gibson.
Oh man.

3777
02:44:00,070 --> 02:44:01,780
Just get them drunk and start talking 
about jews.

3778
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:04,680
JusT wind them up.
Yeah.

3779
02:44:04,810 --> 02:44:07,310
Just wind them up just to show what it 
was.

3780
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:08,650
Jews and money,
man.

3781
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:09,790
Man,
I don't get it.

3782
02:44:10,950 --> 02:44:13,630
It's like lighting a bomb and walkIng 
away.

3783
02:44:14,980 --> 02:44:15,761
It's funny,
man,

3784
02:44:15,761 --> 02:44:17,890
because he's a brilliant director.
He's giving them,

3785
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:19,840
giving them another chance.
Oh,

3786
02:44:19,841 --> 02:44:21,400
here it is.
Is that gary busey?

3787
02:44:21,470 --> 02:44:22,420
Yeah,
it's gary bc.

3788
02:44:22,421 --> 02:44:23,920
He was on top.
It was gary busey.

3789
02:44:23,950 --> 02:44:25,650
Shitty jujitsu.
There's a lot of space there.

3790
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:26,493
Boys.
He goes for the arm bar for terrible 

3791
02:44:28,811 --> 02:44:30,160
guard.
Terrible guard,

3792
02:44:30,310 --> 02:44:32,620
and he gets punched a little bit here,
a little bit of ground and pound.

3793
02:44:32,890 --> 02:44:34,270
This is the.
Watch this.

3794
02:44:34,810 --> 02:44:36,520
Oh my god.
He goes to the triangle.

3795
02:44:36,670 --> 02:44:38,380
He grabs it,
secures it.

3796
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:39,273
Let me see how he handles this here.
Gary boosie should just bite his dick 

3797
02:44:43,810 --> 02:44:44,643
are no rules here.
I'll give this a terrible goddamn 

3798
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:48,310
triangle.
He doesn't even secure it underneath the

3799
02:44:48,311 --> 02:44:49,144
knee.
That'd be great if he was just kept the 

3800
02:44:50,321 --> 02:44:51,154
crowd like nate diaz.
He makes mistake number one and 

3801
02:44:52,951 --> 02:44:54,040
triangles.
He,

3802
02:44:54,100 --> 02:44:57,350
he Went with the calf over,
uh,

3803
02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:58,210
the,
the instep.

3804
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:00,760
Touch the calf instead of go totally 
behind the knee.

3805
02:45:01,210 --> 02:45:04,100
It's just not awkward to know better.
I can do a better trial.

3806
02:45:04,110 --> 02:45:05,570
he pushed,
he choked him to sleep.

3807
02:45:05,690 --> 02:45:07,900
No tap.
What happened there?

3808
02:45:09,950 --> 02:45:12,100
This is bullshit.
What is this?

3809
02:45:12,190 --> 02:45:14,110
That was it.
Let's go back again.

3810
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:16,600
I believe it's come back again.
Now here's what you want to do.

3811
02:45:16,601 --> 02:45:17,434
You want to get an angle and then you 
want to make sure that this insteps 

3812
02:45:19,870 --> 02:45:21,880
underneath your neat.
That way it's locked in place.

3813
02:45:21,881 --> 02:45:23,160
He can't get out of that.
See,

3814
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:23,740
watch,
watch.

3815
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:25,590
Go before that.
See,

3816
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:26,710
watch.
He throws the leg up.

3817
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:28,300
See,
this is all sloppy shit.

3818
02:45:28,750 --> 02:45:31,220
He grabs a hold of his shin,
but what he's supposed to do for real,

3819
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:32,153
grab a hold of his right foot.
Pull his right foot down until it locks 

3820
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:36,633
underneath his left leg.
See how it's all fucking loose and 

3821
02:45:38,201 --> 02:45:41,350
sloppy fitch.
Nobody's getting stuck in that triangle.

3822
02:45:41,410 --> 02:45:44,380
Let's just hop right out of that posture
up and beat your fucking ass.

3823
02:45:45,370 --> 02:45:46,720
Now you're on the bottom.
Stupid.

3824
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:50,560
If you have a jew,
if you have a triangle,

3825
02:45:50,561 --> 02:45:51,394
you got to do it right.
I don't know how and let him get away 

3826
02:45:52,841 --> 02:45:53,674
with that.
They should have made them tighten that 

3827
02:45:54,131 --> 02:45:56,340
up.
What is it a.

3828
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:58,690
Is it a possibility that it's just a 
weight class differences?

3829
02:45:58,691 --> 02:45:59,260
No,
no,

3830
02:45:59,260 --> 02:45:59,741
no,
no.

3831
02:45:59,741 --> 02:46:01,330
It'S just a.
It's just a move.

3832
02:46:01,740 --> 02:46:03,280
It's like you do it right or you do it 
wrong.

3833
02:46:03,340 --> 02:46:06,430
When you do a triangle and you got 
somebody locked up,

3834
02:46:06,460 --> 02:46:08,230
right?
If you've got someone's arm in here,

3835
02:46:08,650 --> 02:46:10,850
if you do this,
you don't have any leverage.

3836
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:12,590
You have no leverage,
but here,

3837
02:46:13,830 --> 02:46:15,200
mother fucker.
Where we going?

3838
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:17,690
I wouldn't fit in there where you would 
fit in there,

3839
02:46:17,691 --> 02:46:19,090
motherfucker.
I'll put you in there.

3840
02:46:19,450 --> 02:46:20,283
I'll squeeze you to sleep.
It's not a matter of when you're going 

3841
02:46:23,571 --> 02:46:25,130
to fit.
I'm going to make you fit.

3842
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:29,300
I'll fit you in there for sure.

3843
02:46:32,300 --> 02:46:33,133
I'll fit you in there.
And if someone like the bigger longer 

3844
02:46:35,901 --> 02:46:37,860
legs day have fucking fit you in there 
heart,

3845
02:46:38,060 --> 02:46:39,620
there's some horrible people to get 
stuck in.

3846
02:46:39,621 --> 02:46:42,740
Their guard I think was a big.
This is my friend brian,

3847
02:46:42,741 --> 02:46:45,460
we should call him beast and brian has 
he,

3848
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:46,333
he's a big strong fucking do,
did a lot of kettlebells and shaves 

3849
02:46:48,771 --> 02:46:49,604
about probably in the two twenties or 
something like that or real athletic 

3850
02:46:51,981 --> 02:46:52,814
dude.
And he waS all legs and this 

3851
02:46:53,991 --> 02:46:55,580
motherfucker,
if you got in his guard,

3852
02:46:55,581 --> 02:46:58,790
it was just.
She's being constricted with giant bones

3853
02:46:58,791 --> 02:47:03,791
and huge muscles.
Just locked triangles in place.

3854
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:06,553
So if you ever rolled with that guy,
you needed to stay the fuck away from 

3855
02:47:09,231 --> 02:47:12,320
his guard because he's just all legs and
power.

3856
02:47:12,321 --> 02:47:14,420
Like the amount of strength that you 
have in your legs.

3857
02:47:14,421 --> 02:47:16,700
Like people don't even recognize it,
but you don't.

3858
02:47:16,700 --> 02:47:17,533
You don't.
Unless you have rolled with someone who 

3859
02:47:19,750 --> 02:47:20,583
has developed their leg muscles and the 
dexterity to pull up jujitsu moves her 

3860
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:24,853
legs.
Like there's certain guys that get to a 

3861
02:47:25,971 --> 02:47:27,620
point where they get really,
really good at that.

3862
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:29,313
WHen you rolled with them,
you realize how much you take your legS 

3863
02:47:31,401 --> 02:47:35,120
and you run upstairs to think of that.
You take your legs.

3864
02:47:35,121 --> 02:47:39,230
You could have a a package in your hand 
and you could run up the stairs.

3865
02:47:39,231 --> 02:47:43,010
You're throwing your body like 
plyometrics up these stairs.

3866
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:44,143
You can't do that with your arms,
but you're so confident choking someone 

3867
02:47:46,761 --> 02:47:47,370
with your arm.

3868
02:47:47,370 --> 02:47:48,720
Oh,
that's totally fucking true.

3869
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:52,530
Your legs are always.
You always take advantage of your feet.

3870
02:47:52,531 --> 02:47:54,300
They're always working.
they're think you're,

3871
02:47:54,490 --> 02:47:55,130
you're carrying

3872
02:47:55,130 --> 02:47:56,660
yourself.
Everywhere you go,

3873
02:47:56,840 --> 02:47:59,630
your bodies carrying whatever it is from
your waist up.

3874
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:02,360
You're carrying 100 plus whatever the 
fuck it is,

3875
02:48:02,361 --> 02:48:04,650
pounds.
You know That's what your upper body is,

3876
02:48:04,651 --> 02:48:05,484
right?
Your legs are constantly getting word 

3877
02:48:06,641 --> 02:48:07,474
out.
Like if you think about like joey diaz 

3878
02:48:09,710 --> 02:48:11,870
or here's even better,
ralphie may,

3879
02:48:12,100 --> 02:48:14,870
you're not fucking strong.
RalphIe may's legs must be

3880
02:48:15,460 --> 02:48:19,540
fucking insane.
He has giant ass leg muscles.

3881
02:48:19,660 --> 02:48:20,920
Oh yeah,
he must.

3882
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:22,090
Do you ever see a,
you know.

3883
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:24,820
Oh,
I hear there's a comic.

3884
02:48:24,821 --> 02:48:29,110
He was good friends with daniel tosh and
he used to be overweight and uh,

3885
02:48:29,290 --> 02:48:30,970
and we were doing a voiceover thing and 
I end,

3886
02:48:30,980 --> 02:48:31,813
he lost like 200 pounds,
but his calves were fucking yoked and 

3887
02:48:36,190 --> 02:48:40,300
we're doing a voiceover that kept saying
his name is eddie eddie.

3888
02:48:40,301 --> 02:48:43,000
He's married to megan malanie.
Um,

3889
02:48:43,270 --> 02:48:45,490
he,
he's anyways,

3890
02:48:45,491 --> 02:48:46,324
casual yoga and um,
I kept going and we're in the voiceover 

3891
02:48:48,251 --> 02:48:51,650
booth and tosh is listening to us do 
voiceover and I kept going,

3892
02:48:51,651 --> 02:48:52,540
man,
your calves are huge.

3893
02:48:52,541 --> 02:48:53,374
He's a guy.
Yeah,

3894
02:48:53,880 --> 02:48:55,960
he'll know they're fucking.
Those are ridiculous.

3895
02:48:55,961 --> 02:48:57,550
I've never seen cows like that in my 
life.

3896
02:48:57,710 --> 02:48:58,750
He's like,
he's like,

3897
02:48:58,751 --> 02:48:59,080
yeah,
I know.

3898
02:48:59,080 --> 02:49:00,010
I know.
Like a big house.

3899
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:00,790
I go,
no,

3900
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:04,060
I don't think you understand.
You have the biggest cat I'm looking at.

3901
02:49:04,061 --> 02:49:07,340
Tosh is in a sound booth laughing 
hysterically and go,

3902
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:08,130
you really

3903
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:10,710
should enter a calf contest.
Those are the biggest calves.

3904
02:49:10,711 --> 02:49:13,380
And taj gives on the thing.
It was bert.

3905
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:16,560
He used to be 380 pounds.
That's why he's got big calves.

3906
02:49:17,240 --> 02:49:17,791
And I was like,
oh,

3907
02:49:17,791 --> 02:49:20,340
this is uncomfortable.
That's a very good impression.

3908
02:49:20,460 --> 02:49:25,350
I felt tosh doing that.
His inflection sounds like the real guy.

3909
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:27,060
Yeah,
but you could,

3910
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:27,923
you know,
if you have the flexibility and the 

3911
02:49:28,751 --> 02:49:31,140
dexterity,
you could do so much with your legs,

3912
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:32,353
your legs control.
Like marcello garcia was one of the 

3913
02:49:33,991 --> 02:49:37,410
greatest jujitsu players of all time.
I did not have a big upper body,

3914
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:38,513
but he had these giant ass fucking legs 
and he would squeeze the shit out of 

3915
02:49:41,671 --> 02:49:45,540
dudes and control them with his legs.
That was a big part of his jujitsu game.

3916
02:49:45,541 --> 02:49:48,120
Was controlling your body legs.
I bet you would.

3917
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:49,740
I used to.
I used to be able to,

3918
02:49:49,741 --> 02:49:50,574
um,
I used to be able to squeeze my legs on 

3919
02:49:53,550 --> 02:49:54,383
when you'd wrestle with friends I can 
get them in where I put my legs around 

3920
02:49:56,401 --> 02:49:59,670
their waist and I remember my buddy came
in would be like,

3921
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:01,080
oh shit.
My parents.

3922
02:50:01,240 --> 02:50:03,240
Oh yeah,
I'm going to take that too far.

3923
02:50:03,690 --> 02:50:04,890
Yeah.
Maybe that guy was going to shit.

3924
02:50:04,891 --> 02:50:05,724
Anyway.
I'm going to use this excuse to arrest 

3925
02:50:07,961 --> 02:50:12,310
with pro wrestling with and just shit 
myself.

3926
02:50:14,130 --> 02:50:16,590
Not some of the weird shit you did with 
your friends.

3927
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:17,433
Read nani's.
So

3928
02:50:17,550 --> 02:50:21,120
I have my friend paulie,
he whacked a stick against a tree,

3929
02:50:21,330 --> 02:50:23,640
you know,
kids are always doing shit like that and

3930
02:50:23,641 --> 02:50:28,641
the stick broke and it went to flip to 
the air and hit my eye brow.

3931
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:30,653
I can cut the shit out of my eye brow,
but like it was a half an inch from my 

3932
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:35,353
eyeball.
It was like the pointy part of this 

3933
02:50:37,411 --> 02:50:40,290
stick that snapped off,
fd whacked against a tree,

3934
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:43,350
went whipping through the air and I 
think about that all the time.

3935
02:50:43,351 --> 02:50:44,570
I could have been blind.
yeah,

3936
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:47,010
I could have been blinded and at one 
dumb move in the woods.

3937
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:47,873
My friend who was an 88,
he just wanted to hit a tree with a 

3938
02:50:49,981 --> 02:50:52,510
stick.
Smacked me with this day.

3939
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:55,350
Easily went blind from that.
I thought about that all the time.

3940
02:50:55,351 --> 02:50:58,440
Like that one fucking moment at one 
moment.

3941
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:04,040
Like if I just went like that,
if I just ducked a little or a raised up

3942
02:51:04,171 --> 02:51:06,990
a little rather just that's all I have 
to do is raise up a little.

3943
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:10,230
And would it went from here to here?
I'll have to do is move.

3944
02:51:10,500 --> 02:51:12,300
Oh,
that's terrifying.

3945
02:51:12,490 --> 02:51:14,160
Yeah,
I didn't see it coming.

3946
02:51:14,430 --> 02:51:15,263
Swat we used,
we used to put a hose up our ass and 

3947
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:22,140
shoot water at our out of our assholes 
that each other.

3948
02:51:22,180 --> 02:51:23,013
Oh,
not good.

3949
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:24,950
It's so not good.
Die from that.

3950
02:51:24,980 --> 02:51:29,060
We used to do it all the time.
kolai blown in each other's faces.

3951
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:29,923
We'd go into each in new smyrna and you 
get out of the from surfing and he'd 

3952
02:51:32,601 --> 02:51:33,434
shoot the hose,
water up your ass and give yourself an 

3953
02:51:34,401 --> 02:51:39,401
enema and then just shit on each other.
Burke caden was here right now.

3954
02:51:42,620 --> 02:51:44,840
Meet came in now and reagan used to shit
on each other.

3955
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:49,100
Oh my god.
You do it when they weren't looking like

3956
02:51:49,101 --> 02:51:52,320
you'd do it to hold it in this bird to 
enough and I'm not even looking.

3957
02:51:53,060 --> 02:51:54,820
I hear,
I heard a buckle.

3958
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:58,930
You just hold it in there and then you 
turn around and shit.

3959
02:52:01,710 --> 02:52:05,800
What the fuck man?
What the fuck are you talking about?

3960
02:52:05,801 --> 02:52:06,100
It was

3961
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:07,960
Florida.
Jesus.

3962
02:52:07,961 --> 02:52:10,090
Everything is Florida.
It goes back to Florida,

3963
02:52:10,210 --> 02:52:11,800
but you guys did produce leonard 
skinner.

3964
02:52:12,180 --> 02:52:12,910
No.
Fuck.

3965
02:52:12,910 --> 02:52:14,980
He did explain that.
Produce the greatest.

3966
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:17,620
One of the greatest bands of all time,
give me three steps,

3967
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:20,350
is an amazing fucking saul.
How about curtis lowe,

3968
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:23,050
the ballot of curtis lowe song people 
don't even talk about.

3969
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:25,960
And you know what's even bigger is if 
you grew up in Florida,

3970
02:52:26,110 --> 02:52:26,943
you remember that distinct.
I'm sure you they did is all over the 

3971
02:52:29,771 --> 02:52:31,750
place,
but I distinctly remember bringing.

3972
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:32,853
You could get a,
a metal metal or glass bottles if they 

3973
02:52:36,531 --> 02:52:40,210
were worth ten cents each and I'm 
bringing them back down to the circle,

3974
02:52:40,211 --> 02:52:41,044
k by my house.
and you walked down with like 10 glass 

3975
02:52:43,481 --> 02:52:44,314
bottles on your fingers and walked down 
to circle k get them in and you buy 

3976
02:52:47,590 --> 02:52:49,090
candy that way.
Wow.

3977
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:49,953
That's a.
He has about collecting old bottles and 

3978
02:52:51,101 --> 02:52:51,540
bring them down.

3979
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:52,660
So on it.
And I was like,

3980
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:54,250
fuck man,
I did that shit.

3981
02:52:54,580 --> 02:52:56,920
Wow,
that's a great song man.

3982
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:58,990
Really?
I got into that song once,

3983
02:52:59,020 --> 02:53:01,110
like three years ago.
You know,

3984
02:53:01,111 --> 02:53:04,030
you like sometimes you go on a trip and 
for whatever reason,

3985
02:53:04,060 --> 02:53:04,893
you know,
like you're sitting on the beach or 

3986
02:53:05,141 --> 02:53:07,180
something like that.
Relax and listen to your iphone.

3987
02:53:07,820 --> 02:53:08,321
Uh,
you know,

3988
02:53:08,321 --> 02:53:09,154
listening to music or something and you 
had this one song that just resonates 

3989
02:53:12,221 --> 02:53:13,280
with the moment.
For me,

3990
02:53:13,281 --> 02:53:15,730
it was that bow bow to curtis lowe.
I was in Hawaii.

3991
02:53:15,731 --> 02:53:17,980
I've listened to that song like 30 times
over the weekend.

3992
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:20,720
Do such a good song.
You know,

3993
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:22,870
this is a list is a little bit of a 
stretch,

3994
02:53:23,170 --> 02:53:27,890
but I went through a period a couple 
years ago where I'd all,

3995
02:53:27,891 --> 02:53:31,420
I'd listened to nxs wow.
What a great.

3996
02:53:31,460 --> 02:53:35,680
An excess if you haven't played them in 
a while when you listened to.

3997
02:53:35,681 --> 02:53:36,514
Yeah.

3998
02:53:39,390 --> 02:53:44,390
I'm telling you that album that if you 
get their best nxs it is such a great.

3999
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:52,300
Yeah,
that kinda choked himself out,

4000
02:53:52,750 --> 02:53:54,460
jerking off.
That's how he died.

4001
02:53:54,700 --> 02:53:55,900
It's got to be,
feel good.

4002
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:58,600
It can't feel that good and people were 
dying for it.

4003
02:53:58,601 --> 02:53:59,434
It's got to feel good.
They just fucked up people just like 

4004
02:54:01,931 --> 02:54:04,330
weird shit.
I watched the movie of them.

4005
02:54:04,510 --> 02:54:06,820
There's a movie of them that,
uh,

4006
02:54:07,180 --> 02:54:09,340
that was on a,
I forget what it's called,

4007
02:54:09,341 --> 02:54:13,600
but it was really great movie and I just
got onto this nxs phase.

4008
02:54:13,601 --> 02:54:14,434
I was riding motorcycles a lot at the 
time and I was listening to nxs 

4009
02:54:16,530 --> 02:54:18,280
motorcycle riding all the time.
Wow.

4010
02:54:18,281 --> 02:54:20,490
I would want to hear what the fuck is 
going on around Me?

4011
02:54:20,530 --> 02:54:22,480
No,
I put it in noise reduction headsets.

4012
02:54:22,481 --> 02:54:25,250
These little ultiMAte ears plugged them 
in and you're.

4013
02:54:25,290 --> 02:54:26,123
You're on the highway.

4014
02:54:26,680 --> 02:54:28,540
You can't hear anything anyway.
It's so fucking windy.

4015
02:54:28,750 --> 02:54:29,650
Oh,
okAy.

4016
02:54:30,070 --> 02:54:31,690
Biggest when you ride motorcycles,
all.

4017
02:54:31,691 --> 02:54:32,524
You got to be as tuned in just yet.
It's amazing how hypersensitive you are 

4018
02:54:36,430 --> 02:54:38,370
to every other driver.
Doesn't have to be.

4019
02:54:39,190 --> 02:54:41,140
When you see those guys zipping in 
between lanes,

4020
02:54:41,141 --> 02:54:43,690
which is a weird thing to be legal.
Does that freak you out?

4021
02:54:43,830 --> 02:54:45,910
Yeah,
because I've ridden motorcycles.

4022
02:54:45,911 --> 02:54:47,320
I'm very respectful.
If I see them,

4023
02:54:47,500 --> 02:54:49,260
I give them space.
He too.

4024
02:54:49,261 --> 02:54:52,840
I moved right over when I see them,
but sometimes you don't see him like you

4025
02:54:52,841 --> 02:54:54,790
hear you hear harley's,
which is real good,

4026
02:54:55,180 --> 02:54:57,820
but there's some of those smaller bikes,
like they're just there.

4027
02:54:57,821 --> 02:54:59,200
All the sudden you're like,
I didn't even see.

4028
02:54:59,390 --> 02:55:01,270
Especially if you listen to shit loud in
your car,

4029
02:55:01,690 --> 02:55:04,180
you know,
if you're fucking jamming

4030
02:55:04,210 --> 02:55:05,043
to the led zepplin immigrant song dot.
That's what I listened to when I get in 

4031
02:55:08,770 --> 02:55:10,310
the cryo tank.
Really?

4032
02:55:10,311 --> 02:55:11,144
Yeah.
Come from the land of the license now 

4033
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:15,080
would've been like,
what about good times?

4034
02:55:15,081 --> 02:55:15,914
Bad times.
At the beginning of that song is one of 

4035
02:55:20,211 --> 02:55:21,044
the best beginnings of a song ever.
Bill burke calls me up one day and he 

4036
02:55:24,981 --> 02:55:27,470
goes,
you're not going to fucking believe it.

4037
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:29,900
He goes,
led zepplin stole that music.

4038
02:55:30,380 --> 02:55:32,120
I went and listened to it.
It's heartbreaking.

4039
02:55:32,660 --> 02:55:35,620
It's heartbreaking if fucking thieves.
Dude,

4040
02:55:35,630 --> 02:55:36,950
I didn't want to believe it.
It's one of those things.

4041
02:55:36,951 --> 02:55:37,784
I was like,
no,

4042
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:39,830
honey,
I didn't even want to listen.

4043
02:55:40,130 --> 02:55:42,980
And once I listened and I go,
come on.

4044
02:55:42,981 --> 02:55:44,060
Really?
And then I called them.

4045
02:55:44,061 --> 02:55:46,220
I really do like,
I can't believe I've added it.

4046
02:55:46,221 --> 02:55:48,500
So he called left a message with 
spectrum people.

4047
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:49,890
Left voicemail messages.
Yeah.

4048
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:50,900
Well,
just a few years ago,

4049
02:55:50,901 --> 02:55:52,970
people who still haven't left a 
voicemail,

4050
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:55,010
leaving a voice message.
My shit's always full.

4051
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:56,990
I don't ever.
He still says,

4052
02:55:56,991 --> 02:55:58,580
I'm out of the country.
If you know me,

4053
02:55:58,581 --> 02:56:00,740
you'll find me.
I don't need that.

4054
02:56:01,010 --> 02:56:03,230
You know joey diaz,
you can't even leave a voicemail.

4055
02:56:03,231 --> 02:56:06,410
He Beat your ass.
I've made that mistake.

4056
02:56:06,411 --> 02:56:09,380
You can't leave a text message either.
You got to call them dog.

4057
02:56:09,410 --> 02:56:10,243
I'll see you call me.
I'll call you back when you and when he 

4058
02:56:12,111 --> 02:56:13,070
calls you,
you got to.

4059
02:56:13,220 --> 02:56:14,510
You got to return that call.
Yeah.

4060
02:56:15,080 --> 02:56:17,450
There's no like,
I'll get later to get to it later.

4061
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:20,870
He's essentially our dad out of all of 
us.

4062
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:23,090
Joey's,
he's the elder statesman for sure.

4063
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:23,953
You know what my phone does now is it 
gives me a text of what the voice mail 

4064
02:56:27,351 --> 02:56:28,101
says.
Yeah.

4065
02:56:28,101 --> 02:56:29,150
That's the new thing with iphone.

4066
02:56:29,150 --> 02:56:31,010
That's fucking crazy.
It's kinD of weird.

4067
02:56:31,850 --> 02:56:32,480
I'm,
I'm,

4068
02:56:32,480 --> 02:56:33,313
I'm switching over.
I'm going to do an experiment for the 

4069
02:56:35,271 --> 02:56:36,104
podcast.
I'm using a windows laptop and I'm a 

4070
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:40,130
trial,
an android phone.

4071
02:56:40,330 --> 02:56:41,163
Really?
I'm going to try this new google pixel 

4072
02:56:43,401 --> 02:56:44,234
phone for a few months.
I'm going to try a windows 10 because I 

4073
02:56:46,460 --> 02:56:48,830
look at people at the airport and they 
have like windows laptops.

4074
02:56:48,831 --> 02:56:50,210
I'm like,
what do you do on that thing?

4075
02:56:50,780 --> 02:56:53,970
What's happening on that thing?
Is that any different like am I.

4076
02:56:54,040 --> 02:56:54,873
Are you experiencing anything that like 
these are like 50 percent of the world 

4077
02:56:57,410 --> 02:56:58,243
interfaces with completely different 
devices and then the other 50 percent 

4078
02:57:01,640 --> 02:57:04,670
got one side.
She was an iphone and max and some.

4079
02:57:04,700 --> 02:57:05,533
Some people use iphones and windows.
It is possible but they do sync up well 

4080
02:57:09,141 --> 02:57:10,880
together,
so oftentimes if somebody has one,

4081
02:57:10,881 --> 02:57:11,714
they have the other and then you have 
other people that are just using an 

4082
02:57:13,121 --> 02:57:14,660
android phones and they're using 
windows.

4083
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:16,490
Computers were mac,
they can use whatever they want,

4084
02:57:16,491 --> 02:57:17,324
but windows.
Computers are a greater percentage of 

4085
02:57:19,761 --> 02:57:23,300
the people using computers in the world 
than anything and when you,

4086
02:57:23,360 --> 02:57:25,940
when you look at them,
they look like they look old.

4087
02:57:26,270 --> 02:57:29,090
They look like they have new ones now 
that look better when you can touch them

4088
02:57:29,091 --> 02:57:31,430
and ship.
A lot of them are thick black.

4089
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:34,250
What's the black computer?
That's what I bought.

4090
02:57:34,300 --> 02:57:36,050
Well it's silver.
I bought a think paD.

4091
02:57:36,051 --> 02:57:38,270
I bought a black thinkpad.
you'd always crazy.

4092
02:57:38,400 --> 02:57:39,233
I did this in philly.
I told everyone to put their phones on 

4093
02:57:40,641 --> 02:57:41,480
the table.
Oh,

4094
02:57:41,481 --> 02:57:43,400
you did that thing.
You're only talking about.

4095
02:57:43,460 --> 02:57:44,300
No.
I went,

4096
02:57:44,630 --> 02:57:45,470
hey,
siri.

4097
02:57:45,650 --> 02:57:49,310
Set a reminder to watch bert kreischer 
special at 10:00

4098
02:57:49,310 --> 02:57:51,170
PM on showtime.
November 11th.

4099
02:57:51,560 --> 02:57:56,560
Look at this.
They do it.

4100
02:57:59,270 --> 02:58:01,010
I'll remind you.
Whoa.

4101
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:02,310
How fucking crazy

4102
02:58:02,310 --> 02:58:03,031
is that?
Well,

4103
02:58:03,031 --> 02:58:06,120
that's one of the reasons why I want to 
try this google pixel because the google

4104
02:58:06,121 --> 02:58:06,954
pixel has this new thing called google 
assistant that's supposed to be next 

4105
02:58:09,391 --> 02:58:10,740
level.
Not only that,

4106
02:58:10,741 --> 02:58:13,290
it's contextual,
so like I can say,

4107
02:58:13,530 --> 02:58:18,220
hey siri,
call bert kreischer and then.

4108
02:58:18,530 --> 02:58:20,340
or it wouldn't be siri.
What's the,

4109
02:58:20,430 --> 02:58:22,660
what do you say to the.
It was darrell,

4110
02:58:22,910 --> 02:58:23,770
darrell,
darrell,

4111
02:58:24,970 --> 02:58:26,250
darrell,
daryl.

4112
02:58:26,251 --> 02:58:27,990
What up dog?
Hey dude.

4113
02:58:28,140 --> 02:58:31,680
How old's bert kreischer?
And then it'll say how old you are,

4114
02:58:31,770 --> 02:58:33,840
and then you could say,
where was he born?

4115
02:58:33,900 --> 02:58:36,660
And it knows who you're talking about.
And they'll say,

4116
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:37,860
oh,
he was born here.

4117
02:58:38,340 --> 02:58:39,173
Really?
Yeah.

4118
02:58:39,330 --> 02:58:40,210
What is he?
What?

4119
02:58:40,340 --> 02:58:41,840
What have I seen him in?
Well,

4120
02:58:41,910 --> 02:58:43,890
if you go to is wikipedia,
you'll shut up.

4121
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:46,140
Siri just keeps me to a website.
No,

4122
02:58:46,440 --> 02:58:48,840
next level.
It's contextual.

4123
02:58:48,841 --> 02:58:50,190
Meaning it knows what you're talking 
about.

4124
02:58:50,700 --> 02:58:51,930
Like you can ask someone,
you can go,

4125
02:58:52,200 --> 02:58:53,400
okay,
well when's their birthday?

4126
02:58:53,460 --> 02:58:56,310
And it'll tell you their birthday.
You don't have to say,

4127
02:58:56,311 --> 02:58:57,144
when is burke crisis birthday?
It remembers you talking about for 

4128
02:58:59,410 --> 02:59:00,500
christ.
That's fucking insane.

4129
02:59:00,510 --> 02:59:03,090
The coolest thing about series that I 
can just be laying in bed and be like,

4130
02:59:03,091 --> 02:59:05,010
hey siri,
set an alarm for 5:00

4131
02:59:05,010 --> 02:59:06,810
PM and set an alarm for 5:00
PM.

4132
02:59:07,050 --> 02:59:09,080
That's pretty cool.
But you can always just set an alarm,

4133
02:59:09,081 --> 02:59:09,901
be lazy.
But nobody,

4134
02:59:09,901 --> 02:59:10,734
like if you're laying in bed,
you don't like to get up and swipe and 

4135
02:59:13,220 --> 02:59:18,220
either your password and find five.
And uh hm.

4136
02:59:21,510 --> 02:59:22,343
I can imagine using a regular alarm 
clock when I go to a hotel and I see 

4137
02:59:24,841 --> 02:59:27,720
that stupid thing next to the bed that's
flashing 12,

4138
02:59:28,160 --> 02:59:28,993
I go,
what is this dumb thing that I have to 

4139
02:59:30,211 --> 02:59:32,220
figure out?
Everybody has a phone.

4140
02:59:32,250 --> 02:59:34,800
Your phone is gonna.
You're gonna set an alarm on your phone.

4141
02:59:35,730 --> 02:59:39,390
Not only that,
your phone knows when you switch into,

4142
02:59:39,391 --> 02:59:40,224
um,
daylight savings time and it resets it 

4143
02:59:41,941 --> 02:59:43,620
for you.
It just happened when I was in New York,

4144
02:59:43,650 --> 02:59:45,420
all the clocks were off and I was like,
fuck,

4145
02:59:45,421 --> 02:59:47,080
I'm late for the taping,
and then I looked at.

4146
02:59:47,090 --> 02:59:48,210
I was like,
oh my phone's fine.

4147
02:59:48,690 --> 02:59:51,690
Yeah,
that did it to me on sunday I woke up.

4148
02:59:51,691 --> 02:59:54,210
I thought it was late,
but it was actually an hour early.

4149
02:59:54,780 --> 02:59:56,260
That was great.
Yeah,

4150
02:59:56,310 --> 02:59:58,080
that our sleep,
they should do that every day.

4151
02:59:58,280 --> 02:59:59,113
It's something though that we have to 
fucking change what time it is because 

4152
03:00:02,071 --> 03:00:02,904
of when it's dark and when it's light,
so that's one of the reasons why those 

4153
03:00:05,101 --> 03:00:05,934
people in Alaska superior,
they reached these stretches where it's 

4154
03:00:08,461 --> 03:00:10,670
never dark.
YeAh.

4155
03:00:10,710 --> 03:00:11,543
They have these weird moments in july,
like when ari and I were there and we 

4156
03:00:14,911 --> 03:00:16,800
went outside,
it was 2:00

4157
03:00:16,830 --> 03:00:19,890
in the morning and it was like 6:30
PM out here.

4158
03:00:20,310 --> 03:00:23,490
That's also arguably why there's so much
drinking in Russia.

4159
03:00:23,970 --> 03:00:24,803
Yes,
because I remember we were there during 

4160
03:00:26,011 --> 03:00:28,380
the white knights and I remember being 
like,

4161
03:00:28,930 --> 03:00:30,960
you'd get done your night and you'd be 
like,

4162
03:00:31,020 --> 03:00:31,853
it's time to go to bed,
but you go out and it'll be fucking 

4163
03:00:32,941 --> 03:00:33,774
bright out.
You'd like go to your room and you'd 

4164
03:00:34,870 --> 03:00:37,920
have to close all the blinds to get 
dark.

4165
03:00:38,010 --> 03:00:39,810
It never got dark.
It's called the white knights.

4166
03:00:39,811 --> 03:00:41,940
As long as it lasts.
Twenty four hours a day.

4167
03:00:42,080 --> 03:00:42,920
No,
I mean for how,

4168
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:43,833
how long of the year?
Probably I have to ballpark it at maybe 

4169
03:00:46,501 --> 03:00:49,440
like a week,
maybe two weeks.

4170
03:00:50,850 --> 03:00:53,370
You're at nature's whim,
but a week or maybe two weeks,

4171
03:00:53,371 --> 03:00:54,204
but then for three months going in,
I'd say maybe maybe a month going in at 

4172
03:00:57,811 --> 03:00:59,530
a month coming out.
It is.

4173
03:01:00,430 --> 03:01:01,263
Well,
like I remember walking around the 

4174
03:01:02,261 --> 03:01:05,200
streets at like 11:00
at night and it was bright like 5:00

4175
03:01:05,201 --> 03:01:05,830
in the afternoon.

4176
03:01:05,830 --> 03:01:08,350
Do you remember 30 days and nights?
No,

4177
03:01:08,351 --> 03:01:11,530
it's a fucking great vampire movie that 
takes place in Alaska.

4178
03:01:11,890 --> 03:01:12,723
They,
the vampires arrive in Alaska when it 

4179
03:01:14,261 --> 03:01:17,710
doesn't get light out for 30 days.
The fuck up dude.

4180
03:01:17,711 --> 03:01:20,530
It's fun.
Fucking great that kill the power.

4181
03:01:20,531 --> 03:01:21,364
Started eating people and they're cool 
vampires speaking some crazy dead 

4182
03:01:24,701 --> 03:01:28,150
language and they have fucked up teeth.
They don't hAve like straight up vampire

4183
03:01:28,151 --> 03:01:32,740
fangs like her mouth is filled with all 
these weird jagged tearing teeth.

4184
03:01:33,910 --> 03:01:36,010
And you know what I love also about 
vampire movies,

4185
03:01:36,070 --> 03:01:39,220
vampire familiars,
that bitch cells everybody out.

4186
03:01:40,140 --> 03:01:40,973
There's always one dude who's a bitch 
who winds up selling everybody out for 

4187
03:01:44,141 --> 03:01:46,870
the hopes that he close up on that guy's
face.

4188
03:01:46,900 --> 03:01:50,560
You get to see what he is.
These vampires look like.

4189
03:01:50,561 --> 03:01:54,610
Just go to the full image view image.
Oh,

4190
03:01:54,611 --> 03:01:56,170
these aren't big.
Yeah,

4191
03:01:56,171 --> 03:01:57,850
there's some pictures.
You'll probably find some.

4192
03:01:57,940 --> 03:02:01,030
Find some way you could see how that's 
just sloppy.

4193
03:02:01,610 --> 03:02:02,740
Sloppy as al jolson.

4194
03:02:05,790 --> 03:02:08,260
Hm.
There you can tell.

4195
03:02:08,290 --> 03:02:10,000
That's a good one.
That's a perfect one.

4196
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:12,820
So there you go.
That's good.

4197
03:02:12,821 --> 03:02:14,800
Costume designer right there.
Fuck yeah.

4198
03:02:14,950 --> 03:02:15,641
Or hair,
makeup,

4199
03:02:15,641 --> 03:02:17,260
whatever that Is.
That's terrifying.

4200
03:02:18,910 --> 03:02:21,160
Yeah.
Tape fletchers in westworld.

4201
03:02:21,161 --> 03:02:22,120
He's in everything.
He's.

4202
03:02:22,150 --> 03:02:23,620
Have you been watching westworld?
Yes,

4203
03:02:24,040 --> 03:02:26,350
I got man.
I fucking geeked out.

4204
03:02:26,351 --> 03:02:30,310
I should have texted him or something,
but I'm watching westworld and I see the

4205
03:02:30,311 --> 03:02:31,144
guy in the fucking cave.
It was like a god damn fucking tape and 

4206
03:02:35,321 --> 03:02:37,330
all of a sudden he gets out of the cave 
and I'm like,

4207
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:40,930
shut the fuck up that state.
And I'm like losing my fucking mind.

4208
03:02:41,500 --> 03:02:44,950
Tate's balling out of control.
So he's working all the time constantly.

4209
03:02:44,980 --> 03:02:46,480
Well,
he's got a great look.

4210
03:02:46,660 --> 03:02:50,080
There is no,
I'm jealous of his beard.

4211
03:02:50,560 --> 03:02:51,940
Strong beard.
It really isn't.

4212
03:02:51,941 --> 03:02:55,840
It's got like curls to it.
It's like if it's a perfect beard,

4213
03:02:55,841 --> 03:02:57,220
I wish I had the commitment.

4214
03:02:57,340 --> 03:02:57,821
He.
Well,

4215
03:02:57,821 --> 03:03:00,250
he pulls it off to it,
like it makes him,

4216
03:03:00,280 --> 03:03:02,490
it defines him better because this,
this,

4217
03:03:02,630 --> 03:03:04,630
that's what it's beards.
Like he's eccentric,

4218
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:06,850
you know,
he's a beautiful eccentric person.

4219
03:03:07,120 --> 03:03:10,990
He's someone I was lucky like he's,
he's an example of why I'm happy to have

4220
03:03:10,991 --> 03:03:11,824
a podcast because I got,
I heard him on your show and then 

4221
03:03:14,440 --> 03:03:15,273
reached out to him and so I'd love to 
have you on my podcast and then spend 

4222
03:03:17,511 --> 03:03:18,490
time with them.
And it was like,

4223
03:03:18,940 --> 03:03:20,560
I,
I love that guy.

4224
03:03:20,620 --> 03:03:23,510
He'S a great guy.
He really is a great fucking guy,

4225

He'll,

4229
03:03:34,930 --> 03:03:37,180

Do you know any comic?

03:03:37,220 --> 03:03:38,950
Yeah,

4231
03:03:38,951 --> 03:03:43,390

doesn't love tate tate's.

4232
03:03:43,391 --> 03:03:45,330
Awesome.
Yeah,

4233
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:49,150
we know some good dudes.
Bert kreischer truth we've got to do.

4234
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:51,550
And some good women to morgan murphy.
I'll fucking.

4235
03:03:51,551 --> 03:03:52,420
Funny.
Was she last night?

4236
03:03:52,990 --> 03:03:54,520
She's hilarious.
She really is.

4237
03:03:54,730 --> 03:03:56,980
She's fucking funny man.
I gotta get her on here.

4238
03:03:57,540 --> 03:03:57,980
Expose the

4239
03:03:57,980 --> 03:03:59,030
world.
She told.

4240
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:00,750
She tweeted last night.
Uh,

4241
03:04:02,330 --> 03:04:06,350
I fucking hate the us.
I'm so glad I don't live there.

4242
03:04:06,410 --> 03:04:07,243
Hashtag [inaudible] los angeles.
And then right after that I started 

4243
03:04:11,271 --> 03:04:14,990
noticing that cal exit.
Cal exit.

4244
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:18,150
Cal exit.
It's like the brexit bill.

4245
03:04:18,370 --> 03:04:21,680
They want California to separate.
Hilarious.

4246
03:04:21,710 --> 03:04:23,540
We're the sixth largest economy in the 
world.

4247
03:04:23,800 --> 03:04:24,591
And so they,
they're like,

4248
03:04:24,591 --> 03:04:26,780
we could just separate and we'd be on 
fucking trump.

4249
03:04:26,950 --> 03:04:27,471
Yeah.
Oh,

4250
03:04:27,471 --> 03:04:28,890
that's funny.
And then he was going to.

4251
03:04:28,891 --> 03:04:30,680
When Jerry Brown,
he's going to be our king.

4252
03:04:31,210 --> 03:04:34,070
That crazy assholes for today.
God will bring him back.

4253
03:04:34,071 --> 03:04:35,330
I'm back.
I'm back.

4254
03:04:36,110 --> 03:04:36,741
Yeah,
man.

4255
03:04:36,741 --> 03:04:39,380
Given full reign to look dude.
The best.

4256
03:04:39,381 --> 03:04:40,214
His last night when everyone started 
admitting to having crushes on morgan 

4257
03:04:42,111 --> 03:04:44,720
murphy.
I didn't see that part.

4258
03:04:44,900 --> 03:04:45,733
Oh,
that must've been when you were doing 

4259
03:04:46,461 --> 03:04:47,550
your set.
Probably,

4260
03:04:47,551 --> 03:04:48,680
yeah.
Someone was like,

4261
03:04:49,620 --> 03:04:50,453
standup goes.
I just got to admit I've always had a 

4262
03:04:51,591 --> 03:04:55,310
crush on morgan murphy and then someone 
else goes a me too,

4263
03:04:55,311 --> 03:04:56,144
and I was like,
I'm married and I have a hardcore 

4264
03:04:57,440 --> 03:04:59,660
corazon morgan murphy,
and morgan was like,

4265
03:04:59,810 --> 03:05:02,330
I don't know what to make of any of you 
fucking drunks.

4266
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:07,370
She was probably trying to avoid a gang 
bang by negotiation.

4267
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:08,930
Yeah,
she's great man.

4268
03:05:09,350 --> 03:05:11,950
She really is funny.
Do you remember what she did that?

4269
03:05:11,980 --> 03:05:13,760
That carloS garcia?
Yes.

4270
03:05:14,180 --> 03:05:16,670
How fucking funny was that?
Say the rest.

4271
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:17,533
Say what?
It was sheet right after the beef broke 

4272
03:05:20,001 --> 03:05:21,740
out where he was stealing and he got 
caught.

4273
03:05:21,920 --> 03:05:23,180
By the way,
this is crazy.

4274
03:05:23,181 --> 03:05:24,920
I didn't know that happened in the olr.
Yeah,

4275
03:05:24,980 --> 03:05:26,780
I thought it happened in the main room 
immediately.

4276
03:05:26,860 --> 03:05:29,060
I'm watching it because I never been a 
club like that.

4277
03:05:29,850 --> 03:05:30,683
Um,
but she then said a carlos men's dia 

4278
03:05:34,251 --> 03:05:35,860
stole from me too,
and she's

4279
03:05:36,080 --> 03:05:39,150
team that I made in 1939,
something like that.

4280
03:05:39,270 --> 03:05:41,430
And then she writes something like that,
something ridiculous like that.

4281
03:05:41,670 --> 03:05:42,503
And then she went into his bits,
but she did them all like she took his 

4282
03:05:45,061 --> 03:05:47,790
worst material and did it super dead 
pan.

4283
03:05:48,180 --> 03:05:49,590
Hello,
my name is morgan murphy.

4284
03:05:49,591 --> 03:05:52,290
I performed the jokes you're about to 
see in the year 19,

4285
03:05:52,291 --> 03:05:53,124
23 cars.
See over for them in 2006 judge for 

4286
03:05:55,981 --> 03:05:58,320
yourself.
But I certainly see similarities.

4287
03:05:58,321 --> 03:06:00,870
I worked very hard in this material,
specifically the line,

4288
03:06:00,930 --> 03:06:02,490
if you don't chill,
you're going to get it.

4289
03:06:04,330 --> 03:06:05,163
Morgan,

4290
03:06:07,880 --> 03:06:09,530
you don't chIli,
you're going to get it.

4291
03:06:09,531 --> 03:06:12,830
So how do we organize these podcast so 
we do more of those live podcasts.

4292
03:06:12,860 --> 03:06:14,810
And when do we do?
How often do we do,

4293
03:06:15,080 --> 03:06:15,913
what do we call it?

4294
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:18,513
I was just keep calling it the end of 
the world called the end of the world 

4295
03:06:20,111 --> 03:06:20,860
pug guests.
Yeah,

4296
03:06:20,860 --> 03:06:21,693
it's the end of the world.
The other world podcast is just the end 

4297
03:06:23,651 --> 03:06:24,484
of the world and we're going to do,
we'll do live ones like we did last 

4298
03:06:28,450 --> 03:06:30,580
night and we'll do them on a regular 
basis.

4299
03:06:30,940 --> 03:06:32,020
Do it once a month,
do you think?

4300
03:06:32,080 --> 03:06:34,180
Yeah,
but next time we do it,

4301
03:06:34,181 --> 03:06:35,014
we can't just have people just walking 
in and sitting down and grabbing 

4302
03:06:37,061 --> 03:06:39,560
microphones.
It was just too many people as it is and

4303
03:06:39,590 --> 03:06:41,380
like burger got interrupted a bunch of 
times.

4304
03:06:41,381 --> 03:06:42,214
Then fights broke out between people 
that weren't even supposed to be there 

4305
03:06:44,081 --> 03:06:47,800
and people that we want it to be there.
SO we'll fix that next time

4306
03:06:47,830 --> 03:06:50,170
we get stand up to come in once a month.
He'll do.

4307
03:06:50,171 --> 03:06:51,460
He loves being here.
He loves.

4308
03:06:51,461 --> 03:06:53,380
He flies in johnny lives right down the 
street.

4309
03:06:53,410 --> 03:06:54,970
Fucking pop in there.
Yeah.

4310
03:06:55,040 --> 03:06:56,550
It doesn't happen again.
Have an apartment here.

4311
03:06:56,580 --> 03:06:59,070
Having good housing has stayed in homes.
Old apartment.

4312
03:06:59,130 --> 03:07:00,000
Yeah.
So

4313
03:07:00,130 --> 03:07:01,330
they'll,
he'll be here all the tIme,

4314
03:07:01,810 --> 03:07:04,330
but we could do those dude anytime we 
want.

4315
03:07:04,331 --> 03:07:06,070
And we call him the end of the world 
once a month.

4316
03:07:06,100 --> 03:07:07,220
Yeah.
Fuck.

4317
03:07:07,380 --> 03:07:08,213
The last time was so much fun and when 
stan hope read that note at the 

4318
03:07:10,601 --> 03:07:11,690
beginning where,
you know,

4319
03:07:11,800 --> 03:07:12,633
he was like,
he was panicking about it and it was 

4320
03:07:13,811 --> 03:07:14,280
really

4321
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:16,410
for worried and then I was like,
come on man,

4322
03:07:16,411 --> 03:07:18,570
it's just going to be easy.
Your response was perfect.

4323
03:07:18,970 --> 03:07:20,400
It's just,
it's just,

4324
03:07:20,490 --> 03:07:21,151
hey man,
don't worry.

4325
03:07:21,151 --> 03:07:22,830
We'll just hang out and talk.
We'll get fucked up.

4326
03:07:22,930 --> 03:07:24,000
Enjoy it.
Yeah,

4327
03:07:24,090 --> 03:07:25,620
easy.
This is going to be easy.

4328
03:07:26,220 --> 03:07:27,330
I think I,
man,

4329
03:07:27,390 --> 03:07:29,810
I'm,
I'm an end of the year podcast.

4330
03:07:29,820 --> 03:07:31,410
Once a month I'm fucking in.

4331
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:33,030
Yeah.
Even if maybe not once a month,

4332
03:07:33,050 --> 03:07:34,490
man,
maybe we do it quarterly,

4333
03:07:34,840 --> 03:07:36,680
you know,
get people jazzed up for it.

4334
03:07:37,010 --> 03:07:39,890
Prime people up and have some reason to 
do it.

4335
03:07:40,010 --> 03:07:42,560
You know,
we could do a gang of those.

4336
03:07:42,980 --> 03:07:45,590
Those are so fun.
And again,

4337
03:07:45,591 --> 03:07:47,390
it's one of those things were all 
together like that.

4338
03:07:47,391 --> 03:07:49,310
We all just start making each other 
laugh.

4339
03:07:49,660 --> 03:07:52,910
Like when we were laughing at burger,
you could see burst out ramping it up.

4340
03:07:52,911 --> 03:07:53,830
Like,
cause he,

4341
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:56,450
he's got an audience of his friends too,
you know,

4342
03:07:56,660 --> 03:07:58,760
so we got all excited,
got to get ds on.

4343
03:07:58,770 --> 03:07:59,603
Ds was supposed to come by last night 
but I think he had a spot somewhere at 

4344
03:08:02,841 --> 03:08:05,120
10 and then was going to shoot over 
there afterwards,

4345
03:08:05,121 --> 03:08:05,954
but it probably went long but you know,
it's hard to get him to go out when he 

4346
03:08:08,871 --> 03:08:09,620
doesn't want it.

4347
03:08:09,620 --> 03:08:12,870
We'll just do,
we'll do it the wAy we like that.

4348
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,400
It was the way it was supposed to go to 
that site,

4349
03:08:15,760 --> 03:08:19,480
which is like we got the core of like 
four guys or three guys,

4350
03:08:19,481 --> 03:08:20,314
four guys and then and throw out some 
Invites to guys that we know that will 

4351
03:08:24,191 --> 03:08:26,350
be fun on there.
Like jim jefferies shown up was great.

4352
03:08:26,650 --> 03:08:31,060
Minus the kids were like,
I wish you were looking at each other.

4353
03:08:31,061 --> 03:08:32,830
Like,
what in the fuck is going on here?

4354
03:08:33,310 --> 03:08:36,010
Is that a baby?
But jim was so confused.

4355
03:08:36,011 --> 03:08:37,300
He's like,
would be a good idea.

4356
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:40,050
Yeah,
I'm down for a lot of stuff,

4357
03:08:40,051 --> 03:08:43,170
but I think I'm less the better 
honestly.

4358
03:08:43,230 --> 03:08:44,970
I think for people's,
the maximum.

4359
03:08:45,030 --> 03:08:47,940
I think we were way over the top 
yesterday,

4360
03:08:48,260 --> 03:08:49,093
you know,
and at times it was so difficult for 

4361
03:08:50,311 --> 03:08:51,120
people,
not everything.

4362
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:54,720
We did a great job considering of not 
talking over each other,

4363
03:08:55,050 --> 03:08:55,883
but it was really hard.
Like there was a lot of times people 

4364
03:08:57,271 --> 03:08:58,104
start a rant and someone would just shit
candidate and dive right into the rant 

4365
03:09:01,411 --> 03:09:02,244
and then they would have to try to 
restart the rant and then someone else 

4366
03:09:03,991 --> 03:09:07,620
would recognize there is a weakness and 
they try to step into and it's like,

4367
03:09:07,680 --> 03:09:08,760
oh,
this is bad.

4368
03:09:08,800 --> 03:09:11,380
That's what you need.
You need guys that are good at that.

4369
03:09:11,410 --> 03:09:13,270
I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying I'm perfect at it.

4370
03:09:13,271 --> 03:09:14,104
I definitely have flaws,
but like I will promise you when I got 

4371
03:09:15,791 --> 03:09:19,570
on that stage I was like,
I was not there to interrupt joe,

4372
03:09:19,571 --> 03:09:21,550
bill,
greg or doug.

4373
03:09:21,551 --> 03:09:22,384
I just.

4374
03:09:23,060 --> 03:09:23,893
No one's trying to do it.
It's just like you might have something 

4375
03:09:25,191 --> 03:09:28,190
really fun and to say and you've feel 
like you've got it to get it out now,

4376
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:30,170
but someone else still talking and 
you're like,

4377
03:09:30,171 --> 03:09:31,150
fuck,
when is this guy gonna talk.

4378
03:09:31,160 --> 03:09:32,750
And then three other people are waiting 
to talk like,

4379
03:09:32,751 --> 03:09:33,920
fuck,
I'm not gonna be able to get this out.

4380
03:09:33,921 --> 03:09:35,450
I'm gonna forgeT it.
It's hard.

4381
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:36,130
And,
and,

4382
03:09:36,130 --> 03:09:38,900
and noticing when you go,
oh there's a punchline right there.

4383
03:09:38,960 --> 03:09:40,160
But in my head I go,
bird,

4384
03:09:40,161 --> 03:09:44,270
have you recognize that when you also 
enjoy to hear what greg fitzsimmons take

4385
03:09:44,450 --> 03:09:47,750
on that very recognizable punchline will
be because it would be better than yours

4386
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:49,460
maybe.
Maybe or you know,

4387
03:09:49,520 --> 03:09:51,290
either way he's talking,
you know,

4388
03:09:51,300 --> 03:09:52,760
like let them,
let them rent it out.

4389
03:09:52,761 --> 03:09:54,070
There's worse than someone

4390
03:09:54,070 --> 03:09:54,903
waiting while you're ranting because 
then you feel them waiting and they're 

4391
03:09:57,240 --> 03:09:58,940
like,
but it's,

4392
03:09:59,170 --> 03:10:00,080
it's,
it,

4393
03:10:00,081 --> 03:10:00,630
it,
it.

4394
03:10:00,630 --> 03:10:01,540
And you're still doing it.
Like,

4395
03:10:01,541 --> 03:10:02,640
hey you're,
you're,

4396
03:10:03,010 --> 03:10:04,580
you're trying to dance with me,
motherfucker.

4397
03:10:04,600 --> 03:10:06,850
You're trying to step in on the dance,
you know?

4398
03:10:06,851 --> 03:10:09,700
And when you're in mid stride it's hard,
you know,

4399
03:10:09,701 --> 03:10:10,534
and the,
the person around you have to kind of 

4400
03:10:11,171 --> 03:10:12,790
recognize that.
And one of the big differences,

4401
03:10:13,060 --> 03:10:16,960
the difference between someone who's 
talking to you and with you,

4402
03:10:17,350 --> 03:10:20,860
like some people just talking to you and
they're waiting for their chance.

4403
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:21,873
Like when you're done talking,
then I'm going to talk and some people 

4404
03:10:23,261 --> 03:10:25,270
are talking with you like you're 
talking,

4405
03:10:25,271 --> 03:10:26,620
and then they go,
oh,

4406
03:10:26,621 --> 03:10:27,454
okay.
And then they start asking you 

4407
03:10:28,331 --> 03:10:29,164
questions,
they're talking with you and they might 

4408
03:10:30,130 --> 03:10:30,963
have a rant and they might not.
They might have something funny to say 

4409
03:10:32,840 --> 03:10:33,673
and they might not,
But they're having a conversation with 

4410
03:10:35,051 --> 03:10:35,884
you that's way easier to listen to see 
when people just start talking at each 

4411
03:10:39,671 --> 03:10:42,940
other and they're not listening to the 
other person that just waiting.

4412
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:45,610
We're all guilty that sometimes 
sometimes he fucking zone out,

4413
03:10:45,670 --> 03:10:47,290
you know,
when you're talking to people,

4414
03:10:47,320 --> 03:10:49,060
but if you,
if you're not engaged,

4415
03:10:49,330 --> 03:10:50,950
the people listening are going to be 
aware of that too.

4416
03:10:50,980 --> 03:10:52,300
So it's going to be weird to listen to.

4417
03:10:52,770 --> 03:10:54,330
Yeah.
It would be weird to listen to.

4418
03:10:54,331 --> 03:10:56,400
I can't wonky.
I can't wait to listen to the podcast.

4419
03:10:56,401 --> 03:10:57,800
It's up right now.
Uh,

4420
03:10:58,080 --> 03:11:00,540
the youtube versions up.
Is the itunes version up?

4421
03:11:00,660 --> 03:11:01,770
No,
it's still rendering.

4422
03:11:03,170 --> 03:11:04,003
Okay.
We're going to upload it when this 

4423
03:11:04,681 --> 03:11:06,390

4424
03:11:06,391 --> 03:11:09,600
So I want to listen to all my flight.
I'm going to be pissing myself.

4425
03:11:09,601 --> 03:11:11,280
We'll have it up tonight.
Where are you flying?

4426
03:11:11,370 --> 03:11:13,140
Baltimore.

4427
03:11:13,320 --> 03:11:14,340
Baltimore.
Wait,

4428
03:11:14,341 --> 03:11:17,190

I'm doing the comedy factory.

4429
03:11:17,340 --> 03:11:19,410
What does that.
Whereas I don't know.

4430
03:11:19,411 --> 03:11:20,700
You're gonna.

Holy shit.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4434
03:11:28,220 --> 03:11:29,520
don't know.
I wouldn't say this out loud,

4435
03:11:29,521 --> 03:11:31,650
but this is our last podcast.
Take a look at that.

4436
03:11:31,950 --> 03:11:32,940
You can't say it out loud.

4437
03:11:33,260 --> 03:11:34,140
I mean,
I can.

4438
03:11:34,380 --> 03:11:35,213
I don't think he.
I don't know if he doesn't mind sharing 

4439
03:11:36,211 --> 03:11:37,500
his numbers.
Oh,

4440
03:11:37,501 --> 03:11:39,450
he's just trying to pull those numbers 
up.

4441
03:11:39,570 --> 03:11:40,403
No,
his.

4442
03:11:40,410 --> 03:11:42,570
That's what his downloads are for 16 
hours.

4443
03:11:42,690 --> 03:11:44,460
That's pretty amazing.
That's fucking amazing.

4444
03:11:44,720 --> 03:11:47,050
Yeah.
Guys going already podcast.

4445
03:11:47,370 --> 03:11:49,800
If you're ever curious of me and our fat
shaming,

4446
03:11:50,670 --> 03:11:51,091
like,
oh,

4447
03:11:51,091 --> 03:11:51,924
this is the most recent one that you 
guys did together as a middle already 

4448
03:11:53,490 --> 03:11:54,750
did want an ra.
And I said,

4449
03:11:54,780 --> 03:11:57,190
made a bet me aryan.
And uh,

4450
03:11:57,300 --> 03:11:58,133
tommy made a bet by January 3rd.
We did our bmr and tom and I both 

4451
03:12:02,701 --> 03:12:04,650
registered obese.
So.

4452
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:07,590
So,
but tom's lying About his height,

4453
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:10,110
but regardless he,
he's fucking five,

4454
03:12:10,111 --> 03:12:11,880
nine.
He says he's six foot.

4455
03:12:11,900 --> 03:12:13,950
He's like,
I'm six foot and a half.

4456
03:12:14,280 --> 03:12:15,570
You.
He's six foot jamie.

4457
03:12:15,650 --> 03:12:18,090
No,
right up next to me.

4458
03:12:18,480 --> 03:12:19,550
He's close,
but no,

4459
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:19,871
no,
no,

4460
03:12:19,871 --> 03:12:20,270
no,
no.

4461
03:12:20,270 --> 03:12:21,870
You ever hung out with tom?
You tower over,

4462
03:12:21,871 --> 03:12:23,670
you know?
Exactly.

4463
03:12:23,700 --> 03:12:25,340
But he's taller than me.
I'm telling you.

4464
03:12:25,350 --> 03:12:25,801
Five,
five,

4465
03:12:25,801 --> 03:12:27,350
eight,
five,

4466
03:12:27,360 --> 03:12:28,141
eight.
He's probably five,

4467
03:12:28,141 --> 03:12:28,974
10 minutes,

4468
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:30,270
man.
I think he's.

4469
03:12:30,330 --> 03:12:32,310
He might be six feet.
It's possible.

4470
03:12:32,520 --> 03:12:34,260
I just don't see tommy line about 
anything,

4471
03:12:34,490 --> 03:12:35,290
but he knows he's.
Oh,

4472
03:12:35,290 --> 03:12:36,240
he's done.
He's an ally.

4473
03:12:36,740 --> 03:12:37,573
It's a misinformation.
He feeds for himself to make himself 

4474
03:12:39,631 --> 03:12:40,980
feel better.
Same way.

4475
03:12:40,981 --> 03:12:43,560
He says that I'm fat and he's skinny.
No,

4476
03:12:43,590 --> 03:12:43,920
no,
no.

4477
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:46,720
He's really honest about that.
He even says like,

4478
03:12:46,740 --> 03:12:48,180
when this first started,
he goes,

4479
03:12:48,181 --> 03:12:49,650
when this first started,
who is fatter?

4480
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:51,680
Me or,
or bert?

4481
03:12:51,770 --> 03:12:52,040
He's

4482
03:12:52,040 --> 03:12:53,410
like,
you said this on [inaudible] podcast.

4483
03:12:53,420 --> 03:12:55,310
That's another one.
And he was like me for sure.

4484
03:12:55,311 --> 03:12:56,480
Right.
And he's like,

4485
03:12:56,481 --> 03:12:57,051
yeah.
He goes,

4486
03:12:57,051 --> 03:12:58,640
that's what I think.
I was definitely faster than him.

4487
03:12:58,760 --> 03:13:00,290
He goes,
but he's faster than me now.

4488
03:13:00,310 --> 03:13:02,030
No,
we're the same weight right now.

4489
03:13:02,090 --> 03:13:03,500
We're the exact same way.
Right,

4490
03:13:03,590 --> 03:13:06,050
but you might be built different than 
him.

4491
03:13:06,170 --> 03:13:06,920
He,
yes.

4492
03:13:06,920 --> 03:13:07,753
He has a cop body and I have more like 
an olympic athlete in the thirties cop 

4493
03:13:10,851 --> 03:13:12,670
buddy.
And so,

4494
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:14,200
so a girl.
So we.

4495
03:13:14,210 --> 03:13:18,800
Our bed is ari.
Ari said that neither of us could get to

4496
03:13:18,950 --> 03:13:21,620
just simply being overweight on the bmi 
scale.

4497
03:13:22,250 --> 03:13:24,650
You could definitely do that.
Just took to 25.

4498
03:13:24,710 --> 03:13:25,543
If you listen to me,
I can get you down to almost nothIng 

4499
03:13:29,090 --> 03:13:29,923
done.
That's it.

4500
03:13:30,560 --> 03:13:31,393
What would you want away?
Like ideally what would you want to 

4501
03:13:32,860 --> 03:13:34,520
away?
It was funny because tom said,

4502
03:13:34,521 --> 03:13:38,600
you know,
we should be weighing like one 92 that I

4503
03:13:38,601 --> 03:13:40,490
would look ridiculous.
My head will look huge.

4504
03:13:40,650 --> 03:13:41,483
Huge.
That is a weird thing that happens to 

4505
03:13:42,231 --> 03:13:44,510
people when they gain weight.
Your head gets bigger.

4506
03:13:44,570 --> 03:13:44,900
Yeah.
My.

4507
03:13:44,900 --> 03:13:45,711
Oh,
do I have a size?

4508
03:13:45,711 --> 03:13:47,360
Hey,
have you ever seen up in my head is so I

4509
03:13:47,361 --> 03:13:48,110
can look at it right now.
No,

4510
03:13:48,110 --> 03:13:48,321
no,
no,

4511
03:13:48,321 --> 03:13:49,450
no.
Put my hat on fuel.

4512
03:13:49,460 --> 03:13:50,400
How big that had is.

4513
03:13:53,760 --> 03:13:54,593
Well,
this is the amount of space between his 

4514
03:14:00,501 --> 03:14:05,180
hat and my head is fucking ridiculous.
Look at this dude.

4515
03:14:05,300 --> 03:14:07,580
This like several inches.
Yeah,

4516
03:14:08,050 --> 03:14:11,720
like look at this.
I have a massive head look at this space

4517
03:14:11,721 --> 03:14:14,720
we're talking about here.
That's crazy in my head.

4518
03:14:15,170 --> 03:14:16,160
I mean,
I'm like,

4519
03:14:16,161 --> 03:14:19,340
no exaggeration.
It's a solid inch all around the front.

4520
03:14:19,460 --> 03:14:21,520
Yeah,
and so that's crazy.

4521
03:14:21,540 --> 03:14:23,210
You're giant.
I wouldn't like smarter.

4522
03:14:23,680 --> 03:14:28,070
How can we not smarter?
My mom says I am not tapping into it.

4523
03:14:28,220 --> 03:14:30,720
Maybe that's what the booze is.
You'll like too much information.

4524
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:33,690
Smart.
I want to take a break.

4525
03:14:33,700 --> 03:14:36,890
I got my high school entrance,
exam number it registered.

4526
03:14:36,891 --> 03:14:40,340
I wanT to take my high school entrance 
exam again and see if I've gotten dumber

4527
03:14:40,341 --> 03:14:43,130
or smarter or you definitely dumber for 
sure.

4528
03:14:43,140 --> 03:14:43,973
You know,
it's not that you're dumber so you 

4529
03:14:44,571 --> 03:14:47,000
forget all the stuff that you had to 
remember eyes from.

4530
03:14:47,330 --> 03:14:48,980
I don't remember anything about 
calculus.

4531
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:50,113
You put a division problem in front of 
me or percentage or imagine if your 

4532
03:14:54,561 --> 03:14:57,470
brain kept growing and you have an issue
and she had it.

4533
03:14:57,471 --> 03:15:01,610
You got to kill brain cells by drinking 
in order to keep your head from pressing

4534
03:15:01,611 --> 03:15:02,444
up the brain,
from pressing up against the side of 

4535
03:15:03,831 --> 03:15:06,320
your head,
by the only way you can get past that is

4536
03:15:06,321 --> 03:15:08,510
to just fucking get hammered every 
night.

4537
03:15:08,920 --> 03:15:09,753
And if you don't,
you have massive headaches or panic 

4538
03:15:11,331 --> 03:15:12,164
attacks because that's what I'm saying.
Maybe that's what's going on in your 

4539
03:15:14,691 --> 03:15:15,524
head is so big and your brain inside of 
it keeps growing and that's why your 

4540
03:15:18,201 --> 03:15:20,870
booze in it.
You just saw trying to kill the weeds,

4541
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:26,200
kill the weeds in the feeling that makes
me feel lonely and kill all that stuff.

4542
03:15:27,080 --> 03:15:29,090
So anyway,
here's the bet with me and ren tommy.

4543
03:15:29,310 --> 03:15:32,240
So we're going to get just to just to 
overweight,

4544
03:15:32,241 --> 03:15:34,940
which is like 2:25.
Why don't you guys just get healthy.

4545
03:15:35,030 --> 03:15:35,990
We're going to try.
We're going to try.

4546
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:37,610
But why do you say that?
You can do it.

4547
03:15:37,700 --> 03:15:39,040
I can do it.
I definitely Hundred percent.

4548
03:15:39,050 --> 03:15:40,160
You could do it.
Totally can do it.

4549
03:15:40,400 --> 03:15:41,930
So why don't you just do it.
I am doing it.

4550
03:15:41,931 --> 03:15:43,220
I'm doing it right now.
Do it right now.

4551
03:15:43,260 --> 03:15:44,840
Yeah.
You have three,

4552
03:15:44,940 --> 03:15:48,110
four,
four that's not doing it well.

4553
03:15:48,111 --> 03:15:48,890
Yeah.
Not right now.

4554
03:15:48,890 --> 03:15:49,740
None of those are diet.

4555
03:15:50,540 --> 03:15:51,373
These records,
these were extras and I don't know what 

4556
03:15:54,120 --> 03:15:55,410
extra.
What is the difference?

4557
03:15:55,440 --> 03:15:57,640
Not really,
but anyway,

4558
03:15:57,641 --> 03:16:00,530
so here's the beto.
If rei,

4559
03:16:00,690 --> 03:16:01,523
if tom and I can get to under obese,
then already has to pay for a trip that 

4560
03:16:05,931 --> 03:16:10,140
the three of us will take.
If tom or I can't get to under obese,

4561
03:16:10,141 --> 03:16:10,974
whoever can't or if both of us can,
then we've got to pay for the three of 

4562
03:16:13,951 --> 03:16:15,510
us to go on a trip.
Who?

4563
03:16:15,511 --> 03:16:16,440
I like it.
Yeah.

4564
03:16:16,830 --> 03:16:17,910
You want to be in the bet?
Nope.

4565
03:16:18,990 --> 03:16:19,823
No,
I wouldn't bet against either one of 

4566
03:16:20,171 --> 03:16:21,260
you.
I tried to help.

4567
03:16:21,340 --> 03:16:23,340
What would my diabete ketosis?
Yeah,

4568
03:16:23,341 --> 03:16:25,170
for sure.
One hundred percent and no sugar.

4569
03:16:25,171 --> 03:16:26,400
No alcohol?
No.

4570
03:16:26,980 --> 03:16:29,820
Exactly.
So you want to do it sunday?

4571
03:16:29,821 --> 03:16:31,980
I'm starting.
I'm starting a diet.

4572
03:16:32,550 --> 03:16:35,950
So you drinking is to squash anxiety?
Yeah,

4573
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:37,440
for me,
mostly like when I'm on the road,

4574
03:16:37,441 --> 03:16:39,480
I'm not someone who can Just like chill.

4575
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:43,230
I cannot just sit in a hotel room and 
just sit there.

4576
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:45,390
Like when I get off stage and I'm,
by the way,

4577
03:16:45,440 --> 03:16:48,180
and this sounds,
this is gonna sound like a lie,

4578
03:16:48,480 --> 03:16:50,280
but like I,
I don't really drink on stage.

4579
03:16:50,400 --> 03:16:52,800
I bring a drink on stage for the first 
show.

4580
03:16:52,830 --> 03:16:54,630
I don't touch it cause I'm talking for 
an hour.

4581
03:16:54,810 --> 03:16:56,630
I'm the only one talking.
Um,

4582
03:16:56,640 --> 03:16:57,473
I don't drink in between shows.
On the second show I'll definitely have 

4583
03:17:00,031 --> 03:17:02,030
a drink,
but that's now that's one drink probably

4584
03:17:02,040 --> 03:17:06,360
I've had throughout the whole night.
So at midnight when I'm done working I'm

4585
03:17:06,361 --> 03:17:07,580
like,
I'm going to,

4586
03:17:07,620 --> 03:17:09,540
I'm going to have a couple beers because
I'm done working.

4587
03:17:09,870 --> 03:17:10,703
And then I'm like,
well I'm not going to go fucking sit in 

4588
03:17:12,031 --> 03:17:14,610
my room sober.
I mean that's what I should do.

4589
03:17:15,210 --> 03:17:17,460
But like I definitely.
So you hit that minibar?

4590
03:17:18,110 --> 03:17:18,641
No,
no,

4591
03:17:18,641 --> 03:17:18,861
no,
no,

4592
03:17:18,861 --> 03:17:19,694
but I'll just sit at the club,
the club and have a few drinks and then 

4593
03:17:23,221 --> 03:17:24,054
go back to my room.
Not fucking plastered but definitely 

4594
03:17:26,161 --> 03:17:30,900
with definitely with probably 600 more 
calories than I should have had.

4595
03:17:32,160 --> 03:17:34,800
And that's where the weight loss when I 
stopped drinking,

4596
03:17:35,130 --> 03:17:37,740
it literally tears off of me.
Now.

4597
03:17:37,741 --> 03:17:39,540
How,
how long have you not drank?

4598
03:17:39,541 --> 03:17:40,650
Four.
What's the longest time?

4599
03:17:40,680 --> 03:17:43,020
I just didn't.
Wasn't drinking for three weeks.

4600
03:17:43,350 --> 03:17:45,050
How much weight you lose?
Uh,

4601
03:17:45,960 --> 03:17:49,580
I got down to three to 30 to 35 was the 
lowest I got,

4602
03:17:49,581 --> 03:17:51,510
but I wasn't really working out at the 
time.

4603
03:17:51,630 --> 03:17:54,900
How much weight do you usually way right
now I'm 2:42.

4604
03:17:55,040 --> 03:17:58,150
So he lost about 10 pounds or 10 pounds.
Eight to 10.

4605
03:17:58,260 --> 03:18:00,210
Just not doing anything.
I didn't even change my diet.

4606
03:18:00,211 --> 03:18:01,044
I was eating like shit,
but I stopped drinking just because we 

4607
03:18:03,331 --> 03:18:04,164
were going under a renovation and a and 
I was getting the allergies and I got 

4608
03:18:08,551 --> 03:18:09,470
sick and I was like,
hey,

4609
03:18:09,471 --> 03:18:10,260
I'm not going to drink.

4610
03:18:10,260 --> 03:18:11,093
I want to get healthy.
So I didn't drink and I wasn't smoking 

4611
03:18:12,931 --> 03:18:15,000
pot.
And then all of a sudden I was like,

4612
03:18:15,220 --> 03:18:16,980
this is boring.
I know shit.

4613
03:18:18,190 --> 03:18:21,780
Like I'm imagining.
Imagine watching a marching band,

4614
03:18:21,781 --> 03:18:23,640
but they don't have the instruments.
They just play the tape.

4615
03:18:24,320 --> 03:18:28,590
What I like is long periods of sobriety 
followed by pot.

4616
03:18:29,220 --> 03:18:30,990
Like when I,
when I take a long time off,

4617
03:18:30,991 --> 03:18:33,210
like many days off and then I'll smoke a
little weed,

4618
03:18:33,450 --> 03:18:35,500
then I go on like adventures.
Yeah.

4619
03:18:35,510 --> 03:18:38,190
I can go on an adventure of the mind or 
I'll go on a hike,

4620
03:18:38,420 --> 03:18:39,253
you know?
I like to get fucked up and go on and 

4621
03:18:40,101 --> 03:18:40,934
walk up hills and shit like that really.
And when I don't do it for awhile and 

4622
03:18:45,241 --> 03:18:46,074
then I do it,
then I get a different feeling out of 

4623
03:18:47,201 --> 03:18:48,010
it.
Yesterday was the

4624
03:18:48,010 --> 03:18:50,740
first time I smoked pot in probably 
three months.

4625
03:18:50,780 --> 03:18:53,230
Really?
It must have hit you so much.

4626
03:18:53,231 --> 03:18:55,140
Fucking fun.
That was good.

4627
03:18:55,180 --> 03:18:59,230
It was so much fun that I,
I remember sitting on stage.

4628
03:18:59,320 --> 03:19:00,153
It was really interesting.
I had like a very surreal moment was 

4629
03:19:02,350 --> 03:19:04,630
sitting on stage and looking at the 
light and look into people going,

4630
03:19:05,110 --> 03:19:06,370
you know what man?
this is.

4631
03:19:06,460 --> 03:19:09,670
Why would anyone not love this drug?
This is pure joy.

4632
03:19:09,910 --> 03:19:11,920
I'm happy.
I feel confident.

4633
03:19:12,020 --> 03:19:14,590
They feel good about myself.
Makes you friendly.

4634
03:19:14,710 --> 03:19:15,543
Yeah.
And it makes you a little anxious 

4635
03:19:16,721 --> 03:19:19,510
sometimes.
What it does do that,

4636
03:19:19,511 --> 03:19:21,040
right?
I'll give you a little bit of anxiety or

4637
03:19:21,041 --> 03:19:22,590
a little bit of paranoia.
Yeah,

4638
03:19:22,900 --> 03:19:24,400
but yeah,
the three weeks was recent.

4639
03:19:24,490 --> 03:19:27,580
I didn't drink and but I wasn't working 
out because I was sick so I.

4640
03:19:27,610 --> 03:19:28,443
But I just lost like eight pounds not 
doing anything and eating kind of 

4641
03:19:31,480 --> 03:19:32,960
shitty.
Yeah.

4642
03:19:32,980 --> 03:19:33,820
I don't know what to tell you

4643
03:19:33,910 --> 03:19:34,743
because if you keep,
if you want to drink all the time it's 

4644
03:19:36,101 --> 03:19:38,020
going to be super hard to lose rate for 
real.

4645
03:19:38,110 --> 03:19:41,650
But if you could go back to that,
go back to not drinking.

4646
03:19:41,651 --> 03:19:42,484
If you think you could perform and have 
a good time and be you and you 

4647
03:19:44,531 --> 03:19:45,210
definitely could.

4648
03:19:45,210 --> 03:19:46,043
I don't.
I don't have a problem performing 

4649
03:19:46,501 --> 03:19:47,950
without alcohol at all.
No,

4650
03:19:47,960 --> 03:19:48,600
no,
no.

4651
03:19:48,600 --> 03:19:50,070
After the show.
But even then,

4652
03:19:50,071 --> 03:19:53,340
I mean if you just decided you wanted to
step away from that,

4653
03:19:53,730 --> 03:19:55,380
you could totally do it.
I would like to.

4654
03:19:55,381 --> 03:19:56,610
I would like to.
I would really,

4655
03:19:56,611 --> 03:19:57,444
really genuinely love to be able to 
smoke pot by myself in a hotel room and 

4656
03:20:01,231 --> 03:20:04,620
not lose my fucking mind.
What about candy?

4657
03:20:04,650 --> 03:20:07,560
Like pot cAndy,
like a small dose man.

4658
03:20:07,561 --> 03:20:08,394
I've done it and I sit in the,
I'm sitting on the couch and I'm stone 

4659
03:20:10,741 --> 03:20:11,521
sober.
I'm like,

4660
03:20:11,521 --> 03:20:13,950
this is going to be my transition to 
relaxing,

4661
03:20:14,250 --> 03:20:15,083
and then all of a sudden I feel my 
asshole so mesh into the couch and I'm 

4662
03:20:17,251 --> 03:20:18,480
like,
I ate too much,

4663
03:20:18,870 --> 03:20:19,621
and then I'm like,
okay,

4664
03:20:19,621 --> 03:20:20,520
I can't breathe.
All right.

4665
03:20:20,521 --> 03:20:21,470
You know what?
I'm going down to the bar,

4666
03:20:21,480 --> 03:20:23,400
I'm getting a glass of wine and I'm 
going to fucking relax.

4667
03:20:24,600 --> 03:20:27,590
And then you down and you're weird and 
some lady sits next to you.

4668
03:20:27,900 --> 03:20:28,980
Yeah.
Let's talk to you.

4669
03:20:29,050 --> 03:20:30,390
Do you think someone sneezes and you 
say,

4670
03:20:30,391 --> 03:20:32,100
god bless you and now you live here.
You're christian.

4671
03:20:33,510 --> 03:20:34,500
Get nervous.
Ranya.

4672
03:20:35,510 --> 03:20:38,100
Yeah.
Xanax would be the alternative.

4673
03:20:38,101 --> 03:20:40,350
That's the.
That was my old school way of like,

4674
03:20:40,740 --> 03:20:42,870
just going back,
taking a half a xanax and going to sleep

4675
03:20:42,871 --> 03:20:45,210
or an ambien,
but that's fucking drugs.

4676
03:20:45,600 --> 03:20:46,650
I mean there's,
it's the same.

4677
03:20:46,651 --> 03:20:47,310
Same.

4678
03:20:47,310 --> 03:20:48,143
Mmm.
I know adults like several adults that 

4679
03:20:51,361 --> 03:20:56,220
take adderall and ambien all the time.
A lot.

4680
03:20:56,280 --> 03:20:57,450
yeah.
That's the combo.

4681
03:20:57,451 --> 03:21:00,570
Parents as a combo,
and these guy lIke this guy,

4682
03:21:00,571 --> 03:21:02,250
if you knew him,
you know,

4683
03:21:02,370 --> 03:21:06,090
very uh,
successful tech guy,

4684
03:21:06,180 --> 03:21:07,013
you know,
he's one of those tech guys and he's 

4685
03:21:08,011 --> 03:21:10,740
taken adderall every fucking day.
Takes it every day.

4686
03:21:10,741 --> 03:21:12,840
It gives me an edge and then he goes to 
sleep.

4687
03:21:12,850 --> 03:21:13,860
Say I take a sleeping pill.

4688
03:21:14,220 --> 03:21:15,600
My,
a guy who used to work with,

4689
03:21:15,601 --> 03:21:17,540
used to take my daffodil every day.

4690
03:21:17,690 --> 03:21:18,523
Modafinil is interesting.
I've taken that before many times I've 

4691
03:21:21,861 --> 03:21:23,640
taken,
it's called new vigil,

4692
03:21:23,720 --> 03:21:24,553
new visuals,
new reverse this provigil and nuvigil 

4693
03:21:26,660 --> 03:21:28,910
haven't taken it to take it pro vigil 
once,

4694
03:21:28,911 --> 03:21:29,744
I don't remember,
but I've taken new vigil several times 

4695
03:21:31,460 --> 03:21:35,720
and it's weird because it doesn't pick 
you up like a speed.

4696
03:21:35,750 --> 03:21:38,030
It's not like caffeine.
You have a crazy buzz,

4697
03:21:38,360 --> 03:21:41,150
but it's like you're awake,
you're like tuned into things.

4698
03:21:41,151 --> 03:21:43,010
It's actually,
it's illegal in the olympics.

4699
03:21:43,280 --> 03:21:44,250
So yeah.
Yeah.

4700
03:21:44,290 --> 03:21:45,123
So it has some of performance benefits 
to it and apparently I might be 

4701
03:21:48,411 --> 03:21:50,510
spreading disinformation near,
but that's nothing new.

4702
03:21:50,960 --> 03:21:51,793
Um,
google tHis for yourself if you want 

4703
03:21:52,821 --> 03:21:53,654
verification.
Apparently it was invented as a 

4704
03:21:57,230 --> 03:21:58,063
performance enhancing drug,
but they had to give it some sort of a 

4705
03:22:00,890 --> 03:22:01,723
medical reason that we would take it and
they said a narcolepsy because it kind 

4706
03:22:06,260 --> 03:22:07,700
of keeps you awake,
keeps you fired up.

4707
03:22:07,730 --> 03:22:10,640
But fighter pilots like it.
Apparently jimmy kimmel,

4708
03:22:10,880 --> 03:22:12,180
jimmy kimmel takes it.
Yeah.

4709
03:22:12,240 --> 03:22:13,550
Maybe that's,
by the way,

4710
03:22:13,551 --> 03:22:15,990
that's a rumor bro.
Information bros,

4711
03:22:16,190 --> 03:22:17,360
but bro science.
But uh,

4712
03:22:17,361 --> 03:22:18,194
yeah,
I've heard that he's narcoleptic and he 

4713
03:22:19,461 --> 03:22:23,770
takes really a comedian that's 
narcoleptic imagine that you're on stage

4714
03:22:23,790 --> 03:22:24,680
this,
but they'll

4715
03:22:25,060 --> 03:22:28,290
not to fall in the sleep in the middle 
of one of his monologues,

4716
03:22:29,120 --> 03:22:31,060
you know,
hitting your fucking head,

4717
03:22:31,061 --> 03:22:32,950
falling down and hitting your head is no
joke.

4718
03:22:33,370 --> 03:22:35,860
That was the hillary clinton story from 
2012.

4719
03:22:35,861 --> 03:22:38,140
That's also what happened at bingo.
Bingo.

4720
03:22:38,141 --> 03:22:38,974
Had some sort of a seizure recently and 
fell and hit her head and she's in 

4721
03:22:41,051 --> 03:22:44,890
really dire straits and stan hope I 
think is flying back to her now,

4722
03:22:44,920 --> 03:22:45,753
but he was,
it was one of the reasons why he was 

4723
03:22:46,511 --> 03:22:49,720
probably like a wee bit hostile this 
tuesday.

4724
03:22:51,610 --> 03:22:53,500
He pulled me aside and when I got there 
and he was like,

4725
03:22:53,620 --> 03:22:55,280
I'm barely holding it together.
Yeah.

4726
03:22:55,400 --> 03:22:57,400
He was like,
if we have a safe word,

4727
03:22:57,880 --> 03:22:59,530
if you noticed it to say,
hey,

4728
03:22:59,531 --> 03:23:01,660
doug could use a shot.
Yeah.

4729
03:23:01,661 --> 03:23:02,494
I mean he's keeping together better than
a lot of people would know much better 

4730
03:23:05,741 --> 03:23:06,700
than me.
Yeah.

4731
03:23:07,730 --> 03:23:09,490
Love that guy.
I really loved that guy.

4732
03:23:09,520 --> 03:23:10,353
Alright.
So we committed to it the end of the 

4733
03:23:11,831 --> 03:23:12,400
world.

4734
03:23:12,400 --> 03:23:14,950
So we'll do the end of the world.
Like we'll do it with four people.

4735
03:23:14,980 --> 03:23:16,660
Will do it every couple months and 
we'll,

4736
03:23:16,840 --> 03:23:18,400
we'll swap people out.
Yeah,

4737
03:23:18,670 --> 03:23:19,503
that'd be the end of the world.
The other world life in the store 

4738
03:23:22,540 --> 03:23:24,280
already.
I think we did three and a half hours.

4739
03:23:24,281 --> 03:23:25,750
Dude.
Shut the fuck up.

4740
03:23:25,780 --> 03:23:26,900
Are you serious?
Five?

4741
03:23:26,990 --> 03:23:28,060
Yeah.
Five 10.

4742
03:23:28,120 --> 03:23:29,880
Holy shit.
Yeah,

4743
03:23:30,140 --> 03:23:30,601
it's five.
Oh,

4744
03:23:30,601 --> 03:23:34,900
five per crash your friday night.
La machine.

4745
03:23:35,170 --> 03:23:36,700
November 11,
10:00

4746
03:23:36,700 --> 03:23:37,390
PM.
Show time.

4747
03:23:37,390 --> 03:23:39,010
Do not.
Fuck this up folks.

4748
03:23:39,011 --> 03:23:40,530
Set that dvr.
goddammit.

4749
03:23:40,540 --> 03:23:43,900
Get on please.
Please get on it when you guys were cool

4750
03:23:43,901 --> 03:23:44,734
as fuck.
Promoting it all throughout the podcast 

4751
03:23:45,881 --> 03:23:46,930
last night.
Oh my pleasure.

4752
03:23:46,931 --> 03:23:48,790
My friend.
I know it's going to be hilarious.

4753
03:23:48,791 --> 03:23:49,624
I'm excited that you did it too.
I'm really excited that you're spending 

4754
03:23:51,371 --> 03:23:52,720
more time and stand up.
You know,

4755
03:23:52,750 --> 03:23:53,583
I just think,
uh,

4756
03:23:53,800 --> 03:23:55,330
well it's like we were saying about your
show.

4757
03:23:55,500 --> 03:23:56,333
Your show is fun and I love doing it,
but you almost like not tap into your 

4758
03:23:59,741 --> 03:24:01,600
potential as a comic because you're so 
funny.

4759
03:24:02,160 --> 03:24:03,540
You got to do it right.
We have to do it.

4760
03:24:03,541 --> 03:24:05,560
So you don't forget to put in the work.
Yes.

4761
03:24:05,561 --> 03:24:09,100
Anything else telling these people about
a bird cast on twItter?

4762
03:24:09,250 --> 03:24:10,280
Yeah,
I got my,

4763
03:24:10,560 --> 03:24:12,490
like ari and I had been talking numbers 
a lot.

4764
03:24:12,491 --> 03:24:15,670
And so for those of you who don't know,
rem in our texting our first day numbers

4765
03:24:15,671 --> 03:24:19,120
to each other just because we are full 
fucking disclosure.

4766
03:24:19,640 --> 03:24:20,473
that's a beautiful thing about the 
friendships I've had based on meeting 

4767
03:24:22,961 --> 03:24:25,390
you.
A lot of my friends,

4768
03:24:25,420 --> 03:24:28,540
we tell each other how much we make.
We tell each other what our numbers are,

4769
03:24:28,680 --> 03:24:32,770
we so that we don't get fucked or they 
can get better things all.

4770
03:24:32,790 --> 03:24:33,120
Yeah.

4771
03:24:33,120 --> 03:24:35,660
You got to be honest too.
It's like I think it's important like,

4772
03:24:35,690 --> 03:24:36,523
dude,
I did not sell good in cleveland or 

4773
03:24:37,261 --> 03:24:39,420
something about cleveland or pittsburgh 
was rough for me.

4774
03:24:39,580 --> 03:24:40,413
We opened up our lives in,
in front of each other and go through 

4775
03:24:42,161 --> 03:24:44,250
our podcast and oh,
you had him.

4776
03:24:44,320 --> 03:24:45,153
You didn't do well with him.
How come I wonder why your numbers were 

4777
03:24:47,491 --> 03:24:48,300
low on him?

4778
03:24:48,300 --> 03:24:49,133
Well,
what's really cool about podcast as 

4779
03:24:50,131 --> 03:24:52,370
opposed to you might as well just keep 
that song.

4780
03:24:52,371 --> 03:24:53,204
I'm just slightly lightly as opposed to 
anything else is the numbers are so 

4781
03:24:56,341 --> 03:24:58,710
hardcore.
Whereas like you get like ratings,

4782
03:24:58,711 --> 03:24:59,251
like,
oh,

4783
03:24:59,251 --> 03:25:01,610
we have a one point five on the 
nielsens.

4784
03:25:01,620 --> 03:25:02,453
You don't even really know how many 
people that is just guessing based on 

4785
03:25:04,951 --> 03:25:07,170
this algorithm.
They created over a very small amount of

4786
03:25:07,171 --> 03:25:09,270
houses.
It's not that many people you're pulling

4787
03:25:09,271 --> 03:25:10,740
from.
It's certainly not 100 percent.

4788
03:25:11,010 --> 03:25:13,140
When you're getting a podcast and you 
see that number,

4789
03:25:13,141 --> 03:25:15,420
that is a hundred percent of the people 
that have downloaded it.

4790
03:25:15,810 --> 03:25:17,760
One hundred percent.
There's no if,

4791
03:25:17,761 --> 03:25:18,900
ands or buts.
it's very.

4792
03:25:18,901 --> 03:25:19,734
I mean,
some of them might have downloaded it 

4793
03:25:20,161 --> 03:25:22,890
twice if they're crazy,
but for the most part,

4794
03:25:22,920 --> 03:25:25,830
without whatever percentage you have 
that are repeats for most part,

4795
03:25:25,831 --> 03:25:26,790
that's unique people.

4796
03:25:26,920 --> 03:25:27,400
Yeah.
Uh,

4797
03:25:27,400 --> 03:25:28,233
tommy and I taught me,
me and you alWays talk about this and 

4798
03:25:30,400 --> 03:25:32,830
they're the ones who said you need to 
really focus on your podcast.

4799
03:25:32,831 --> 03:25:34,960
You're slipping on your podcast.
So I picked it out.

4800
03:25:35,020 --> 03:25:39,010
Every wednesday I focused on the guests.
I only get guests I want to talk to that

4801
03:25:39,011 --> 03:25:41,080
I'm interested in now I don't do 
bullshit like,

4802
03:25:41,340 --> 03:25:42,790
oh,
he seems one of whatever.

4803
03:25:42,791 --> 03:25:43,750
Just get.
I need a guest.

4804
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:46,900
I do guests I want and I released on 
wednesday and man,

4805
03:25:46,901 --> 03:25:47,734
my numbers have a have tripled in,
in like five months and ari's numbers 

4806
03:25:54,701 --> 03:25:55,534
are going through the roof.
Tom's numbers are fucking sick right 

4807
03:25:57,761 --> 03:25:58,541
now.
Yeah.

4808
03:25:58,541 --> 03:26:01,630
Podcasts are exploding and we can people
reach your podcast.

4809

Would love to get a studio.

4817
03:26:19,890 --> 03:26:21,640
Oh,

4818
