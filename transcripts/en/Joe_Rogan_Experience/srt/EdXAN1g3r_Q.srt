1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,590
Hello Freak bitches rat
scare the fuck out of me.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,390
We've talked about on the podcast before,

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:08,280
I had a bad situation with a rat,

4
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:08,591
wants it,

5
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,810
a pool hall in New Jersey.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,320
Me and my friend John went to this place
to play pool and there's this fucking

7
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,520
huge rap.

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,590
I'll never forget this big giant fucking
crazy yellow teeth and scare the shit

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,750
out of me getting bitten by the rat race.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,030
I have a great rat story and I
really wanted something good one.

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:27,880
Um,

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,730
so back,

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,720
back in the Disney?

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,623
No.

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,823
What'd you ask her?

16
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,773
She's not

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:36,681
oil.

18
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:37,441
It's pretty dark.

19
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,320
So like you know what,

20
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,330
let me,

21
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,420
let me paint this with my tone postcards.

22
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,463
Dark,

23
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,220
dark.

24
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,820
So I used to work in retail and the story,

25
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,571
yeah,

26
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:49,404
let's call it

27
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,613
rad spread.

28
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,750
That's actually really loud.

29
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,383
Sorry

30
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,323
blood.

31
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,090
So I was working in retail
and it was a horrible job.

32
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:07,980
It was like totally degrading as a human
and all you would do is fold clothes

33
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:11,790
all day and it was really expensive and
these people would come in and spend

34
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,360
ridiculous amounts of money on clothes
and they were just shitty and mean and

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,320
rude and rich,

36
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,070
whatever.

37
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,480
Not that that all constitutes,

38
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:20,820
but it was just an unpleasant experience.

39
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,290
And from whether it was a
customer or the staff that,

40
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,740
you know,

41
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,920
my employers were just not kind and
they didn't give a shit about you.

42
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,080
So I was already,

43
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,460
I knew I was kind of walking on thin
ice because I wasn't like enthusiastic

44
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,031
about being there.

45
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:36,864
It was just a job.

46
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,430
And um,

47
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,460
one day before the biggest sale of the
year where people like late ladies freak

48
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:44,904
out,

49
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,330
I came into the store and that
weekend there had been like,

50
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,200
there had been indications and evidence
that there were rodents because,

51
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,140
and I,

52
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,490
you know what?

53
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,160
I knew it were,

54
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,470
it were rats cause I could smell them.

55
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,011
I swear to God.

56
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:56,580
I was like,

57
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,330
I could smell it.

58
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,860
Literally when someone
says I can smell a rat,

59
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,510
there's a musty smell to them.

60
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,080
You can fucking smell them.

61
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,271
Oh,

62
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:03,910
it's totally,

63
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,490
cause my first house in La,

64
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,850
I moved into off of a Craig's
list ad had rats and I knew I,

65
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,970
I was like that smell light.

66
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,890
I know that smell.

67
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,300
That was from my old house.

68
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,134
That's a rat.

69
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,660
So long story short,

70
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,770
the exterminators come in and
set traps the night before.

71
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,620
So Saturday morning when
like this big sale starts,

72
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,221
every,

73
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:23,881
all the girls were like,

74
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:24,500
oh my God.

75
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Do you think they call it something?

76
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:26,334
I Dunno.

77
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,060
We walk into the store and there's like,

78
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,620
there's one dead rat upstairs,

79
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,810
there's one in the traps downstairs,

80
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,680
another one downstairs.

81
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,570
And then there was another,

82
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,630
there was a trap that had been deployed
and there was a piece of a big large

83
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,600
piece of a tail and blood.

84
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,670
I'm talking blood all over the clothes,

85
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:48,780
all over the wall,

86
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,943
but no rat.

87
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,720
And one of the girls had
walked into the front of the,

88
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:58,860
of the store and also you should know
there was a line forming outside of people

89
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:01,480
that wanted to get in to get
this end of the year sale.

90
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,120
One of the girls walks in,

91
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:04,420
she goes,

92
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,253
oh with that,

93
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,940
and it was the size of a cat and it was
the rat that got that got out of the

94
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,680
trap that like lost its tail was in the
middle of the store bleeding and it was

95
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,850
like this big,

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,230
everybody's freaking out.

97
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,140
One of the girls was ballsy enough
to throw a trash can over it.

98
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:20,974
So it's like,

99
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,370
no,

100
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,020
it's like screaming in this.

101
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,170
And so at this point and this point,

102
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,010
it's time.

103
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,870
It is time to,

104
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,360
to open the store and all that.

105
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:32,620
Like people are knocking on
the window and we were able to,

106
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,100
like,

107
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,730
we were able to sort of create a diversion
and put some clothes racks so you

108
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,200
couldn't see the trashcan

109
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,160
on the window.

110
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
Nobody was letting them know what I mean?

111
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:44,231
This was like a,

112
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:48,430
it was screaming like you couldn't
no one [inaudible] so we called the

113
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,264
exterminator.

114
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,280
Oh it gets so much better.

115
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,900
The exterminator comes back.

116
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,290
We're like,

117
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,561
dude,

118
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:55,300
there's a fucking live rat in the store.

119
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,650
We can't open the doors.

120
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,431
We have a sale.

121
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,360
There's a line around the block,

122
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:58,600
like,

123
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,261
you know the owner,

124
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,190
everybody's on the phone,

125
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,570
everybody's freaking out,

126
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,460
exterminator shows up.

127
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,580
And he walks in,

128
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:06,791
he's like,

129
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,181
oh yeah,

130
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:07,490
that's a,

131
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,261
that's a problem.

132
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:08,621
And he's like,

133
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,090
well I don't know my pellet gun.

134
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,583
So,

135
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,641
and the next thing I know,

136
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:16,780
he walks out to his truck and he comes
back with a two by four and he's like,

137
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,580
you ladies might want to step back,

138
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,410
kicks the trashcan open
and just fucking splat.

139
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,303
Like he was

140
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,790
watching him,

141
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,460
watching him fucking blow up of
watermelon in the middle of the store.

142
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,660
So then,

143
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:34,790
oh,

144
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,623
it gets so much better.

145
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,470
So after he kills the rat and it's like
guts and end trails are all over the

146
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,280
place.

147
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,480
The Mat store managers like,

148
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:43,721
ladies,

149
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,100
we need to clean this
up and opened the store.

150
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:45,461
I was like,

151
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,960
are you fucking serious?

152
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,370
So like buckets of bleach and
whatever clothing has the blood on it.

153
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,031
Just take it out.

154
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,221
We'll,

155
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:52,480
we'll,

156
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,810
you know,

157
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,100
we'll cancel it out later.

158
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,690
So we're cleaning,

159
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,100
we're running around.

160
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,140
And I'm not kidding you,

161
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,560
the door's open five minutes.

162
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,390
And the manager who was my age,

163
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,280
calls me upstairs and she's like,

164
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,114
Suzanne,

165
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,013
can I have a word with you?

166
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:08,981
And I'm like,

167
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:09,091
yeah,

168
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:09,251
yeah,

169
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:09,461
sure,

170
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:09,830
whatever.

171
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,940
Go upstairs and I get fucking fired.

172
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,560
She was like,

173
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:14,831
look,

174
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:15,101
you know,

175
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,720
we've been wanting to talk to you about,

176
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,080
you know,

177
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,130
your performance here.

178
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:18,400
And like,

179
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,731
I don't feel,

180
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,200
I know that you want to be a musician,

181
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:20,831
just want to be,

182
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,280
and I was like,

183
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,113
fuck it.

184
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,143
But anyway,

185
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,103
I was like,

186
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,890
you couldn't fire me before he
made me clean up the rats blood.

187
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,290
I had to clean up the
blood and then get fired.

188
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,150
Are you fucking kidding me?

189
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,920
Like it was one of those
moments where I literally,

190
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,870
I lost my shit and then she was like,

191
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:37,991
well,

192
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:39,850
you can stay for the rest
of the day if you want.

193
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:40,390
I was like,

194
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,430
you think I want to stay
here and look at you.

195
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:43,330
I hate you.

196
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,164
You know,

197
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,220
it's horrible.

198
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,690
But it's such a good story.

199
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,010
So going through it was
all worth it at the time.

200
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,320
Well,

201
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,891
it was just,

202
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,724
I'd never,

203
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,950
I had never experienced like any,

204
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,360
it's such a fantastical story.

205
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,060
Fantastic story.

206
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,933
It's crazy.

207
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,410
Isn't it funny how a story that is
absolutely horrible at the time becomes

208
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,333
awesome?

209
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,690
Oh yeah.

210
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,870
It was really good in the past.

211
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,520
It was a low point though,

212
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,540
cause it was so insane.

213
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,940
Like when someone in like dig,

214
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,650
like just degrades you like that.

215
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,371
Like she said,

216
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,840
I know you're trying to be a musician,

217
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,980
but like your heart's on in it.

218
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:19,311
And I was like,

219
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,200
of course I don't want to
go out and sell it again.

220
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,640
Yeah.

221
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,510
I don't want to cleaning up.

222
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:23,901
Right,

223
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,734
exactly.

224
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,830
You're right.

225
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,890
I just don't get rats or two by fours.

226
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,600
You need to examine your priorities.
